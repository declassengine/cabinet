naval SITUATION.General Review.Germany attacked Russia early on Sunday, the 22nd June.Naval forces continue to support our armies in the Eastern Mediterranean.Two German supply ships have been intercepted in the Atlantic.Shipping losses during the week are below the average.Home Waters.2. An M.T.B. carried out a sweep off the Dutch Coast on the 20th and early on the 21st 3 of our M.G.Bs. engaged 3 E-boats off Smiths Knoll and chasedthem to the vicinity of Ymuiden. The E-boats suffered damage from Oerlikongun fire.Three enemy aircraft were shot down, one each by H.M. Trawlers Capstoneand Solon and one by a convoy which was attacked off St. Abbs Head.H.M. Destroyers A rrow and Pytchley were damaged by mine off .FlamboroughHead, on the 21st and 23rd respectively. HATS. Kenya and H.M. DestroyerBrighton were in collision east of Iceland (C) on the 25th. The Brighton wastowed to Fteydanfiord (E. Coast of Iceland) for temporary repairs and the Kenyamay need docking on her return from patrol.Three minesweeping trawlers have been sunk and one damaged by aircraftattack at night. Details of these and other casualties to H.M. Auxiliary vessels are given in Appendix V.Our aircraft have sunk or damaged 5.100 tons of enemy shipping off theenemy Channel coast; reconnaissance suggests that the coastwise shipping hasbeen appreciably reduced.   Details are given in the Air Section of this Resume.Atlantic.3. H.M.S. London intercepted the German Babitonga (4,422 tons) disguisedas a Dutch ship, 950 miles S.W. of Freetown. The Babitonga scuttled herself.She had sailed from Santos (Brazil) on the 24th April, bound for Brest with a cargo of cotton, and it is believed 1,000 tons of diesel oil. The German supplyship Alsterufer was sighted by a patrol early on the 22nd, about 240 miles west of Madeira, but escaped. A Catalina aircraft found her in the evening and bombed her without result. A search by destroyers on the following morninglocated her 200 miles south-west of Finisterre and she scuttled herself. A numberof survivors, including 44 British, were rescued.The ex-Vichy French ship Criton (4,564 tons) with a British prize crew onboard, is feared to have been sunk by a French warship to the north-west ofFreetown on the 21st June.On the 17th June H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Pretoria Castle interceptedthe French Desirade (9,645 tons) and sent her to St. Helena.Mediterranean.4. On the 21st June the French Hospital Ship Canada was intercepted 50miles south of Cyprus and was sent into Haifa for search; the result was satisfactory and the ship was allowed to proceed.Naval aircraft attacked destroyers in Beirut with torpedoes on the night21st/22nd, and a damaged destroyer was subsequently observed in the harbour.In the early morning of the 23rd H.M. Ships Leander and Naiad with FI.M.Destroyers Jaguar, Kingston and Nizam encountered and engaged two Frenchdestroyers 10 miles north of Beirut. Both French destroyers were hit several times, but they were lost behind a smoke screen and the guns at Nahr-el-Kelbopened fire on our forces.H.M. Submarine Taku torpedoed a ship in Benghazi harbour on the11th June, and on the 12th sank a ship in a convoy, the position of which hasnot been reported.
H.M. Submarine Unbeaten on the 16th attacked and possibly sank a largeItalian liner of about 20,000 tons in the Straits of Messina.On the 25th submarines attacked a south-bound convoy of four shipsescorted by seven destroyers to the east of Sicily, and two of the ships were laterreported crippled.H.M.S. Warspite received slight damage from a near-miss in an air raid onAlexandria on the night of the 22nd/23rd.ELM. Sloop Auckland on escort duty was sunk by air attack on the 24th20 miles north-east of Tobruk.During the week 6 French ships (29,000 tons) have passed Gibraltar east-bound and 3 (11,000 tons) have passed westbound.East Indies.-5. H.M. Contraband Control Vessel Chakdina captured a dhow laden withfoodstuffs off Perim on the 16th; a second ran ashore and was abandoned by her crew.China.6. The British Yu Sang (3,357 tons) was boarded and searched by an armedparty from a Japanese naval auxiliary on the 21st June. The master was forcedto sign a statement that he had no objection to the visit.On the 19th the Dutch Sunda Strait patrol intercepted the French Compiegne(9,986 tons) and sent her in for examination.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. During the week there has been a number of attacks by aircraft onU-boats or traces of U-boats, such as oil tracks, and of these the most noteworthytook place to the south of Cape Clear and probably resulted in appreciable damage to the enemy.Aircraft have also co-operated with surface craft in several attacks to the westward of Ireland, but none of these has been conclusive.H.M. Trawler Visenda engaged a U-boat on the surface about 100 miles south-east of Iceland (C) on the 22nd and probably obtained at least one hit.Visenda was damaged and her Captain was killed.H.M. Corvette Gladiolus, escorting a homeward convoy, has reported sinkinga U-boat on the 25th about 600 miles south-east of Greenland.ELM. Submarine Parthian sank a Vichy French Submarine of the Requinclass (1,000 tons, built 1924) to the south-west of Beirut on the 25th June.Enemy Intelligence.German.8. The main units are still concentrated in the western Baltic and southernNorwegian waters, with the exception of the battle cruisers and the 8-inch cruiserat Brest, and the new 8-inch cruiser Seydlitz at Bremen. The battleship Tirpitzwas still at Wyk (near Kiel) on the 21st June. At Kiel the Admiral Scheer had come out of dry dock and was seen alongside on the same day, but the Lutzow andthe 8-inch cruiser were still in dry dock. Reports of one of the old battleships atthe entrance to The Sound and of the two 6-inch cruisers at Oslo Fjord were con-firmed by air reconnaissance.U-Boats.9. During the week it is estimated that some 25 German U-boats have been operating in the North and Western Atlantic and a few. in the latitude of the cape Verde Islands.  No recent locations of Italian U-boats have been obtained.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. Casualties to shipping so far reported are again below the average.Damaging attacks by U-boats on a homeward bound convoy were made to the
south-east of Greenland, and an outward convoy in the same area lost at least one ship. Ships were also attacked in the North-Western Approaches and tothe west of the Azores. Enemy mines off the east coast have caused severalsinkings. Aircraft attacks in Home Waters have, in the main, been concentrated on the east coast in the dark hours and have done some damage. Two ships havealso been sunk by aircraft attack off the coast of Portugal, after they had dispersedfrom their convoy.A Turkish ship, carrying crews for the Turkish submarines building inEngland, was torpedoed, north-east of Cyprus.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the&apos;25th June 1,289 ships, including 211 allied and 35 neutral, were convoyed. One battleship, 2 cruisers, 15 armed merchant cruisers, 5 anti-aircraft ships. 73 destroyers and 88 sloops, Fleet minesweepersand corvettes were employed on escort duties. The figures of escorting vesselsfor the same week last year were 11 armed merchant cruisers, 15 destroyers,26 sloops and corvettes to escort a total of 822 ships. During this week last year it was estimated that 7 U-Boats were operating, all on our Atlantic seaboard,whereas during this past week some 30 have been at sea covering an area as farsouth as Freetown and as far west as the Newfoundland seaboard.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the21st June totalled 918,650 tons compared with 1,005,633 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 847,432 tons during the past ten weeks.Oil imports were 239,174 tons compared with 357,988 tons last week. mineral imports were 202,424 tons, of which 129,460 tons were steel, pig iron, scrap ironand iron ore. Timber imports were 35,129 tons and cereals 228,197 tons, 31 shipsbeing fully laden with grain and flour. Other food imports totalled 131,048 tons,which included : sugar and molasses, 56,445 tons; refrigerated and tinned meats,bacon and ham, 26,624 tons; fruit, 6,778 tons (997 tons of lemons); cocoa, 3,198tons; tea, 2,996 tons; eggs, 2,474 tons; jam and honey, 1,205 tons. Tobaccoimports were 2,152 tons. Imports also included large consignments of machinery,ammunition, aircraft and aircraft parts.British Minelaying.12. H.M.S. Plover laid 100 mines in the East Coast Barrier on the 19th anda further 100 on the 21st June, and H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 270 mines on the 20thand a further 270 on the 25th June. H.M.S. A gamemnon and H.M.S. Menestheuslaid 940 mines off the East Coast of Iceland (C) on the 25th, and 14 magnetic mines were laid in the Boulogne area by Motor Launches on the 23rd June.There has been some minelaying by aircraft off the Frisian Islands, and off FrenchAtlantic ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. Enemy minelaying has been mainly on the East Coast, though some was suspected off south-western headlands and mines have been laid off Liverpool,Holyhead and Milford Haven.On the East Coast groups of mines, mainly acoustic, have been laid nearcertain of the War Channel buoys, whilst others have been scattered along theChannel.During the week 23 magnetic and 58 acoustic mines have been detonated, 41of them off the Humber. The mine totals are now : magnetic 1,237, acoustic 784,contact 911.Foreign Waters.14.   Lagos is not yet clear and Takoradi is also believed to have been mined.Enemy Merchant Shipping.15.   The Roumanian tanker Campina, 3,032 tons, passed into the iEgeanfrom the Bosporus on the 18th June with 3,650 tons of benzine.
On the 19th June the Italian Fleet Tanker Tarvisio, 5,484 tons, entered theBosporus, bound, it was thought, for Italy. On the 20th June, the Celeno,3,741 tons, and the Tor cello, 3,336 tons, entered the Bosporus bound for the^aegean, both loaded, the latter with 5,000 tons of petroleum.MILITARY SITUATION.Operations. ?Libya.16. On the Western Desert front the position has remained quiet. Theenemy has been taking energetic steps to recover derelict A.F.Vs. from the battle area. There has been considerable reduction in enemy M.T. which hasbeen moving Westwards from the frontier area.At Tobruk our position has been strengthened by penetrations into the salient held by the enemy in the outer defences of the Perimeter.Syria.17.   Fighting continues in all sectors.The Free French supported by British and Indian troops have takenDamascus and our troops are advancing along the Damascus-Beirut road.Quneitra has been retaken by our troops and after severe fighting Merjayounhas been evacuated by the Vichy French.In the coastal area our troops are pushing forward slowly and are attackingpositions at Jezzin and Damour.Ffabforce moving from Iraq along the Kirkuk-Tripoli (S) pipeline hasencountered opposition at Palmyra, which is still in the hands of the enemy.A abyssinia.18. In the Gondar area, although no further advance of any importance hasbeen made by our forces, active patrol work continues.In the South, our advance on Gimma has resulted in the capture of that towntogether with some 8,000 enemy troops including three generals and eightbrigadiers. Our columns have pursued the retreating Italians in a North -Westerly direction and the latest news reports the capture of Agaro and Bedelle.At the latter point our forces are within 30 miles of the advanced troops of thecolumn operating from the North, which, after driving the enemy out of Lechemti,swung South and are reported to be giving help to patriots operating in the Argioarea. The latter are probably not yet across the River Dadessa. On the Westernedge of this sector enemy patrols have been active against our troops in theGhidami area. It appears probable that these operations will have reduced thearea held by the enemy in this sector by about 50 per cent., with a possible exception of small unco-ordinated units which may require mopping up, and thefinal stand by the Italians is likely to take place in the triangle formed byMendi-Ghimbi-Dembidollo, an area in which communications have been developed by the Italians.Intelligence.German operations against Russia.19. The German attack on Russia, which began early on the 22nd June,appears to be developing in four main thrusts.(i) From East Prussia against the Baltic States, N.E. in the direction ofLeningrad.(ii) North of the Pripet Marshes towards Vilna and Wolkowysk.(iii) South of the Pripet Marshes in the Wlodzimierz (Vladimir) areatowards Brody.(iv) From Roumania against Bessarabia.   In this area operations are inprogress, but no information about them is available. It is reportedthat German and Roumanian troops are attacking Cernauti.
Details are lacking as to the situation on the Finnish frontier, and there areno reports of land fighting in that area as yet.Syria.20. There are still no reliable indications of an early break in Vichy moralewhich, if anything, has improved of late. The Vichy forces are putting up astubborn and skilful resistance, making good use of the mountainous country inthe Central sector, and their successes have developed in them a battle psychologywhich was absent in the beginning of the campaign.It is reported that German specialists are standing by to supervise the demolition of the pipe-line if the British advance cannot be held up.Spain.21. Long-term German preparations, such as civilian penetration and the planning of Gestapo activities, continue. The general preparations are probablysufficiently advanced to enable the Germans to enter Spain at any moment if she were acquiescent. It is doubtful, however, whether they would attempt to cross the Spanish frontier with the forces now available if they expected to meet withresistance. It is unlikely, moreover, that Germany will take any action in Spainuntil she has achieved a striking success elsewhere, possibly against Russia,although she might move earlier if she believed a British landing in the iberian peninsula, the Atlantic Islands or Morocco was imminent.AIR SITUATION.General Review.22, &quot; The initiative remains in our hands in the West and, by comparison,the German effort was inconsiderable. Heavy bombers maintained a sequence of intensive raids against enemy territory at night. By day, our fighters carried out a series of strong offensive sweeps over Northern France and shot down largenumbers of Messerschmitt fighters over their own territory.Less than one-fifth of the German long-range bomber force has been active in the West during the past fortnight, and nearly 90 per cent, of the unitsengaged are specialists in anti-shipping operations. It may be assumed,therefore, that, in planning the Russian campaign, air blockade rather than the bombing of land targets in Great Britain was the Germans&apos; primaryconsideration.Intensive air operations covered our withdrawal in Cyrenaica in the early part of the week, and continue to support the offensive in Syria.There is little authoritative news of air operations in the Russo-German war.Germany and Occupied Territory.General.23. Bomber Command despatched 173 sorties by day and 846 by night.Fighter Command provided escort and support for daylight attacks over North-East France, and in the course of these operations inflicted heavy casualties.Day.24. Apart from the 20th June, activity over North-East France was intensivethroughout the week. Escorted by fighters, Blenheims of Bomber Commandattacked aerodromes at Longuenesse, Desvres and Mardyck, electric power stations at Chocques and Comines, the docks at Havre and the railway centre atHazebrouck. The attack on the latter target was particularly effective, an ammunition train being blown up and two railway bridges hit, one of whichcollapsed.   Four Blenheims were lost during daylight operations.25. Strong forces of Spitfires and Hurricanes provided close support andcover, a total of 141 fighter squadrons being thus employed during the week.In the course of combats over enemy territory and the Channel, severe casualties
were inflicted upon the enemy, who lost 108 Me. 109 fighters destroyed, 38 probably destroyed and 43 damaged; these losses included a large number of the newMe. 109 F. fighters. Twenty-two of our fighter aircraft were lost, but the pilots of eight were rescued.26. There was an increase in enemy defensive fighter operations, especiallyover the Straits, but the effort on the 21st, when 430 sorties were flown, wasnot maintained. The subsequent drop in the figures, in spite of our continuedoffensive operations, is noticeable and may be due to casualties.Night.27. Our offensive was maintained against important objectives inGermany and in Occupied Territory throughout the period under review.Although the number of bombers despatched did not reach the record figureattained last week, over 1,055 tons of bombs were released. Industrial and railway centres at Cologne and Dusseldorf were persistently attacked : on fouroccasions in force, and by single aircraft on the three remaining nights. Ship-building yards and other targets at Kiel, Bremen and Wilhelmshaven were alsoheavily bombed, the first being attacked on four nights and the second on. two nights. Boulogne, Dunkirk, Emden and Essen were subjected to smaller scaleraids.28. In most instances assessment of results was difficult owing to the thickground mist which generally prevailed, but a large proportion of bombs were reported to have fallen within the target areas, and numerous fires, some of themlarge, could be seen. From all night operations twelve Bomber Command aircraft are missing.29. Night operations against enemy aerodromes in France were maintained by Havocs during the week.United Kingdom.30. Fighter command flew 1,245 patrols, involving 4,644 sorties, by day, and536 patrols, involving 776 sorties, by night and in dusk and dawn patrols. Thesetotals include the operations reported in other sections. German operations havebeen on an extremely small scale, both by day and night.31. On the evening of the 23rd, about thirty enemy fighters made a briefsweep over East Kent. During daylight only about ten reconnaissance aircraft have been plotted overland, while about 220 long-range bombers and recon-naissance aircraft operated round our coasts. In addition to the casualtiesinflicted on the German Air Force over France, our fighters have destroyed, off theSouth and East Coasts, four German fighters and a bomber, and damaged twobombers.32. By night, during the week about 285 enemy long-range bombers and80 fighters were plotted, the majority of the former being off the coast. Eighty-aircraft were probably engaged in minelaying. Southampton and Merseysidewere attacked on two nights, but not on a heavy scale, while scattered bombingtook place in Eastern and South-Eastern coastal districts on several nights. Tenenemy aircraft were destroyed at night, six by fighters.Coastal Command.33. Coastal Command flew 319 patrols (428 sorties), and provided escortsfor 101 convoys (323 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols carried outby Fighter Command totalled 851 (1,774 sorties).34. On the afternoon of the 19th June, three Blenheims of coastal command, with fighter protection, attacked a merchant vessel of about 5,000 tonsoff Etaples. One aircraft registered a direct hit on the vessel, which was escorted by a destroyer, two A.A. ships and an E-boat, While taking evading action this aircraft hit the sea and lost an airscrew, but returned on one engine and landedsafely without casualty.
35. Other operations against enemy shipping consisted&apos; of searches forsuitable targets from Norway to the Bay of Biscay, but comparatively few vessels were sighted. Aircraft of Bomber Command found and destroyed a merchant vessel of about 100 tons off the coast of Holland and, in the course of strikes by coastal Command on a convoy 80 miles from Ushant, a direct hit was scoredon a merchant vessel, but the bomb bounced off the deck without exploding.36.   A total of 27 aircraft were detailed to lay mines off Brest.37. Sea-mining by enemy aircraft, though widespread, showed an appreciable decrease on last week. Attacks on our shipping were made during daylight off Start Point and the Needles, but the majority of this activity tookplace off the East coasts of England and Scotland at night, though a few attacks were reported. Shipping and weather reconnaissances were carried out offCoastal areas, towards Iceland (C) and in the Bay of Biscay.Central Mediterranean.38. Blenheims have again flown many sorties to attack shipping betweenSicily and North Africa, and, though no vessels are claimed as having been sunk, at least two were severely damaged. Several near misses were observedwhen a merchant ship of 2,000 tons was attacked off Luza on the 19th, and onthe 22nd six Blenheims attacked an escorted convoy near Lampedusa, severelydamaging a ship of 6,000 tons. On the following day, a reconnaissance aircraftreported two escort vessels and two merchant ships, one of which was in tow,proceeding very slowly 50 miles behind the convoy.39. Five Swordfish made a bombing attack on Tripoli (L) harbour on the night of the 23rd/24th, and secured direct hits on the railway line and theSpanish Quay, where a fire was started. A successful attack was made by Hurri-canes on &quot;flying boats moored in Syracuse harbour, and many were seen to bedamaged.  A hangar and barracks were also hit.40. Reconnaissance aircraft have flown over the Ionian Sea and the coastsof Sicily, Southern Italy and Tunis, and daily searches have been made for enemy shipping. A Maryland on reconnaissance over Tripolitania machine-gunnedItalian bombers on Misurata landing-ground, setting fire to three and damagingothers.41. The Italian Air Force made no serious attack on Malta, though a fewbombs were dropped on the night of the 21st/22nd. A single bomber/escorted by about fifteen fighters, twice approached the Island on reconnaissance, and onthe second occasion was severely damaged by Hurricanes, which also destroyedthree of the escort.Egypt and Cyrenaica.42. During the early part of the week, our fighters were actively engagedin covering our withdrawal, and on the 18th 103 sorties were flown. attacks were made on the enemy&apos;s lines of communication, and protection was given toour bombers, which were enabled to attack enemy armoured vehicles and transportwithout fighter interference. Three Ju. 87&apos;s were destroyed and three enemy fighters were damaged, while we lost four Tomahawks. Fighters protecting our shipping destroyed an Italian bomber and drove off two others.43. Night attacks by Wellingtons against Benghazi have continued, but the weather has hampered operations. Large fires were seen to break out in the harbour district, and at least one ship was set on fire. Day and night attacks were also made on many landing grounds and on transport; 20 vehicles were destroyed by Blenheims at Agedabia on the 23rd, and during an attack onEl Gazala on the 26th five enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground andothers damaged. In the forward areas six enemy aircraft were shot down andthree of our fighters are missing.44. iilexandria was attacked by about thirty enemy aircraft on the night of the 20th/21st and on two other nights by smaller numbers; no serious damage was done.  Five Me. 109&apos;s machine-gunned the aerodrome at Sidi Barrani on the
26th. Single aircraft have attempted an occasional daylight reconnaissance ofthe Suez Canal area.Syria.45. Intensive air operations in Syria have continued through the week. Inaddition to bombing attacks in close support of our troops, Blenheims haveattacked a variety of targets, including railway bridges, aerodromes and harbours.On the 22nd, Blenheims scored a direct hit on a tanker in Beirut harbour, andbombs also fell on a Vichy Destroyer which is believed sunk; a merchant vesselalongside was set on fire. The French garrison at Suweida, in the Druze country,was attacked on three days.46. Many low-flying attacks were made by our fighters, which also main-tained patrols over naval units and forward troops. On the 20th, Tomahawksdestroyed or disabled about 100 motor vehicles on the Damascus-Beirut road, asa result of which it was completely blocked; later Blenheims destroyed a furthertwenty vehicles. On the 23rd, Tomahawks and Hurricanes, of which three are missing, attacked! a number of enemy landing grounds, destroying at least nineaircraft and damaging twenty-six; a hangar was set on fire. On the return journey two Dewoitine fighters were shot down.Fighters of the Royal Australian Air Force shot down three French Potezaircraft on the 25th and damaged others. Two aircraft of the same type were destroyed by our A.A. fire earlier in the week.47. Repeated and accurate attacks were made on our troops near Palmyraon the 22nd by French aircraft. Damascus, Haifa and Acre were bombed by german aircraft which caused a number of civilian casualties but no damage ofimportance.48. Fourteen more Dewoitine fighters have arrived, making a total of 47.Up to the 23rd, 37 Vichy aircraft had been destroyed, six probably destroyed and43 damaged since the beginning of operations.East Africa.49. Bombing and machine-gun attacks have continued against enemy positions and communications. Direct hits were observed on buildings andtransport in the Gimma district, and several attacks were made on the fort atDebra Tabor, near Lake Tana. Eleven Italian bombers and four fighters were found burnt out on Gimma aerodrome.Russia.50. There is very little authoritative information of air operations in the russo--German war, though both sides claim to have inflicted heavy losses andto have carried out extensive and successful air operations.51. During the opening stages of the campaign the German Air Force hasbeen mainly engaged in operations in close support of the Army. The principalconcentrations of German units on the Eastern Front are at present in east prussia and the Warsaw a,rea, co-operating with the drive of the German land forces between the Baltic Sea and the Pripet Marshes, west of Brest-Litovsk.From Roumania also units are engaged in attacking Black Sea ports and theRussian Army in Bessarabia and the Ukraine. There are also German land andair forces in the extreme north of Norway, thus completing the deployment ofGerman forces along the entire length of Russia&apos;s western frontier. During thelast ten days some thirty German aircraft have been flown by Finns from Germanyto Finland, and the Germans are reported to be installing air defences at Helsinki.52. Early on the morning of the 22nd June, the Russian forces were attacked by the Germans. There had been reports that the Russian Air Force had been concentrated in the forward areas, and this is probably the reason why theGermans started their campaign by severely bombing a number of aerodromesalong the Western frontier. There has also been some bombing of Russian centres of communication, including railway junctions. The Russian forces appear tobe fighting well in the South, and there are reports that fairly heavy anti-aircraft
fire has been encountered lby German fighters and reconnaissance aircraft.Russian fighters, presumably I. 16s, have been operating in the South, in theOdessa military district.Air Intelligence.German A aircraft The Me. 109 F.53. Some details of this version have been obtained from a prisoner of war.The aircraft is said to have an absolute ceiling of 39,600 feet and a maximum permissible diving speed of about 500 m.p.h. The range is even shorter thanthat of the Me. 109 E. An important feature is the rearrangement of the arma-ment. This has been cut down to two machine-guns and one 15 m.m. cannon, togive increased performance. Although the concentration of all guns into thefuselage probably improves the firing qualities, the armament is now a very smallone indeed.The Me. 109 F. is not fitted with the new &quot; Ha Ha &quot; process, which is saidto increase the speed of fighters by some 60 m.p.h. for about 5/10 minutes, byfeeding accelerator gas into the cylinders. This is partly because the necessary equipment makes the aircraft dangerous, and the Me. 109 F. is alleged to be fastenough without it.Spain.54. It is known that German Air Force officers have recently carried out a very thorough inspection of aerodromes both in Spain and Spanish Africanpossessions. Previous visits of inspection have been made from time to time by german Air Force personnel, ostensibly with the object of giving the Spaniardstechnical advice for the modernisation of their aerodromes.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.55.   No bombing has occurred during this period by Night.56. Bombing throughout the week was on a minor scale except on the nights of the 21st/22nd and 25th/26th June, when slightly heavier bombing occurred at Southampton and the surrounding district. The feature of these two nightswas the greater number of parachute mines dropped.On other nights, slight bombing occurred over widely scattered places,amongst which were Merseyside, Gorleston near Yarmouth, Margate and in theLondon Region.Damage.Southampton, 21st/22nd June.57. In the Dock area there was serious damage to a shed and a leak was caused in King George V Dry Dock. At the Southern Railway&apos;s Central Stationthe down-line platform was practically demolished and the main lines wereblocked by debris. Normal traffic was resumed on the 23rd June. The damage to house property was heavy.Elsewhere.58. At Gorleston damage received by the gas works has temporarily stoppedsupplies, and at Birkenhead the entrance to the Mersey tunnel was damaged. at other places only minor damage occurred.Casualties.59. Casualties for the week ending 0600 hours, the t&amp;feii June, are estimatedat 39 killed, 116 seriously injured.   There were no casualties in London.
