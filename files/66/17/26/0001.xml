Cypher Telegram from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in theUnion of South Africa, dated July 3, 1941.(No. 754.   Most Secret and Personal.)Your telegram No. 715 of 1st July.Following is most secret and personal message for Prime Minister from prime Minister : Thank you for your personal message and other messages connected with the changes in the Middle East. I did answer your previous personal message on28th June by the High Commissioners No. 737. wavell&apos;s replacement may, forthe moment, have a disturbing effect on public opinion owing to the great generalconfidence in him. But personally I am not surprised, especially after the slow progress in Syria and the lamentable set-back in the Western Desert comingafter other regrettable happenings. My personal impression also was that the cairo machine had become clogged and full, and resolute use was not made of our strength in the Middle East. Wavell had become, in effect, Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff of a vast war machine with ineffective organisation to sustain him.I trust the far-reaching changes now made will remove the principal difficulties.But closer association of air and military should also be insisted on after our recent experiences.I consider your programme of air and tank reinforcements adequate if carried out. Special attention should be given to repair and maintenance, whichis much retarded. With Syria in our hands, Iraq well held by Indian forces andour sea entrance maintained in the Eastern Mediterranean, our forces in theMiddle East should prove a match for any enemy forces that could reach theMiddle East.I hope to be free to visit Cairo towards the end of this month when the newCommander-in-Chief has settled clown. If there is any special reason for goingsooner, please let me know.Apart from small irritating set-backs, our cause has really improved verymuch this spring. The American effort is gathering full force; the attack on russia, whatever the outcome, can only mean exhaustion of Germany&apos;s essentialreserves without compensating replacements; the home defence position has improved until Germany has at last been forced to go eastward, and the Hessflight indicates something rotten inside the German core.We can therefore move forward with calm and resolute confidence in thefuture. I trust most earnestly that you are conserving your strength for the daysahead.
