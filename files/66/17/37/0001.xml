I.Telegram from the President to Former Naval Person, dated June 26. 1941.I am asking Congress in a few days for additional funds to substantiallyincrease our building of merchant ships so that we should build a minimum offive to five and a half million tons in 1942 and seven million tons in 1943.II.Telegram from Former Naval Person to the President, dated July 1, 1941.I am most grateful for your telegram about American merchant shipbuilding programme. This vast expansion opens up the prospects of the future and assuresthe means of continuing the war in this vital sphere to a victorious conclusion.I know you will feel with me the pain that such vast masses of tonnage shouldhave to be sunk before being replaced by colossal American efforts. Any increasein our escorts will produce an immediate saving in losses. Forgive me mentioningthis, when I know all you are doing. The last ten days have been very fruitfulin enemy submarine destruction. Four Germans, two Italians and a hostile Vichyboat having been certainly disposed of. We are also getting very good resultswith our own submarines in the Mediterranean against enemy merchant vessels and by our Air attacks by bomb or torpedo upon them both in Home waters andthe Mediterranean. I am asking that everything here shall be at concert pitchfor invasion from the 1st September.   I trust your health continues good.III.Letter from the Minister of War Transport to the Prime Minister,dated July 11, 1941.At the last meeting of the Battle of the Atlantic you asked me whether thefigures given in the Presidents personal telegram to you, No. T. 341, were grossor deadweight tons. I have just been on to Salter on the telephone and have got from him the answer to your question.The figures used by the President are deadweight tons. The figures put upto the President by the Maritime Commission and the shipbuilding experts were very much in excess of those which the President communicated to you. ThePresident felt, however, that the assumptions on which the experts had basedtheir calculations might well prove much too optimistic. There might, forexample, be labour troubles or unsuspected bottle-necks might appear; for these reasons the President scaled the figures down to 5 to million tons deadweightin 1942 and 7 million tons deadweight in 1943. If, however, the programmeproceeds according to plan the output should be considerably higher.
Minute from Lord Cherwell to the Prime Minister.(Reference letter of July 11 from the Minister of War Transport.)The ships designed under the American programme for 1942 have1-45 deadweight tons to the gross ton.   Hence their programme is: :1942 ...       ...        3-4-3-8 million gross tons.1943 ...       ...        4-8        million gross tons.We are constructing at the rate of about 1 million gross tons.Over the last year our losses have been about b\ million gross tons.
