naval SITUATION.General Review.Shipping losses during the week are below the average.British and Allied submarines have inflicted considerable casualties on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.Naval forces have continued to support the flanks of our armies in Syriaand Libya.A German TJ-Boat has been destroyed to the westward of Gibraltar.Home Waters.2. The enemy warship, which was attacked by aircraft of the coastal command on the night of the 12th/13th south of Norway, and which was described in last week&apos;s Resume as a cruiser, was later reported to be a pocket-battleship, probably the Lutzow. After being attacked and hit she headed forthe Skagerrak at reduced speed.  Details of this attack are given in paragraph 59.On the 17th, two German destroyers were reported by air reconnaissanceproceeding down Channel, and were subsequently attacked by aircraft with torpedoes.H.M. Destroyer Vanessa, while escorting a coastal convoy, was hit by a bomb early on the 19th, and was towed to port, with both boiler-rooms flooded.The Faroese Trawler Thor during the night of the 12th/13th shot down anenemy aircraft north of Kinnairds Head and, on the 13th, the s.s. Dalemoor shot down a Ju.88 which had bombed and set her on fire off Stonehaven.The blockship King Henry was sunk and damage was done to the docks atLowestoft in an attack on the 13th by a single aircraft.During an air raid on Chatham on the night of the 13th/14th, minor damage was done to naval establishments, including Admiralty House, the Royal Navaland the Royal Marine Barracks and the R.N. Hospital.There have been only two casualties to auxiliary patrol vessels, both by mine;details are given in Appendix V.Aircraft of the Coastal and Bomber Commands sank or damaged 15,640 tonsof enemy shipping during the week. Details of the attacks are given in the AirSection of this Resume.Atlantic,3. A German supply ship was intercepted and sunk by H.M.S. Sheffield.This is in addition to the five ships reported in last week&apos;s Resume.The Finnish Kronoborg (8,287 tons), bound from Petsamo to New York, was intercepted 200 miles S.E. of Iceland (C) on the 13th and ordered into Kirkwall.The Norwegian tanker Liss (5,932 tons), was shelled by a shore battery onthe 12th, when 15 miles off the Los Islands (French Guinea) 60 miles N.W. ofFreetown. An aircraft spotted for the battery and also attacked the ship with machine gun fire.Mediterranean.4. Off the Syrian coast units of the fleet and naval aircraft have continuedto support the flank of the Army. On the night of the 12th/13th naval aircrafttorpedoed a large French destroyer of the Guepard class (2,500 tons, five 5-5-inch guns) in Djounie harbour, 8 miles north of Beirut. On the following night anunidentified ship was torpedoed by our aircraft in Beirut. On the 15thH.M. Destroyers Ilex and I sis were damaged by bombs. During the night of the15th/16th and again early on the morning of the 17th naval aircraft successfully attacked the French destroyer Chevalier Paid (2,500 tons, five 5-5-inch guns)north of Beirut. On the 16th H.M. Destroyers Jervis and Kimberley claimedfour hits by gun fire on two French destroyers which were chased into Beirut.In the iEgean, H.M. Submarine Parthian torpedoed a large tanker off theDardanelles and sank two sailing vessels and a lighter in Mitylene harbour.
H.M. Submarine Torbay sank three caiques bound for Mitylene, a schoonercarrying troops and stores to Lemnos, and the Italian tanker Giuseppina Ghiradi(3;319 tons).H.M. Submarine Clyde, during the period the lst-14th June, sank a 4,000-ton ship off the south-east coast of Sardinia, a 2,500-ton ship in the Gulf of Policastro,and a sailing vessel south of Sardinia.H.M. Trawler Jade, off Cape Passero, was unsuccessfully attacked by two -boats, one of which was damaged by gunfire.The Netherlands submarine 0.24 sank a large tanker and a small merchant ship in the Gulf of Genoa,In the Western Mediterranean a considerable reinforcement of aircraft was flown off to Malta from H.M. Aircraft Carriers Victorious and Ark Royal coveredby the Gibraltar force.During the week seven French merchant ships (upwards of 16,000 tons), west-bound, and twelve (65,850 tons), eastbound, have passed Gibraltar under escort.East Indies.5. TI.M. Cruisers Dauntless and Emerald were in collision on the 15th,resulting in nineteen casualties in H.M.S. Emerald. Both ships proceeded to portunder their own steam.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. H.M. Destroyer Faulknor, during the nisrht of the 17th/18th, sank aGerman U-Boat 120 miles west of Tangier. Four officers and twenty-three ratingswere made prisoner.During the week three other attacks have been made on U-Boats by surfacevessels and six by aircraft, but without definite result. Two of these were to the eastward of the Orkneys, four in the North-Western Approaches, one to the north-west and one to the south-west of Iceland (C), and one 300 miles E.S.E. of st. John&apos;s, Newfoundland.Enemy Intelligence.German.7. Photographic reconnaissance on the 17th showed the Battleship Tirpitz, the pocket-battleships Lutzow and A admiral Scheer and the 8-inch cruiser Hipper inKiel. The two latter were still in dock. Four destroyers, nine torpedo-boats and forty-two U-boats were also present. The two battle-cruisers and thePrinz Eugen remain at Brest. The 6-inch cruisers Ntirnberg and Emden were reported to be at Copenhagen and Oslo respectively on the 13th.Italian.8. Two Cavour-class battleships were seen by air reconnaissance on the13th at Naples.U-boats.9. There has been considerably less activity in the Freetown area, fromwhich three German U-boats have made their passage to French Biscay ports in the course of the week. This still leaves four in the South Atlantic. In theWestern Atlantic an unknown number of U-boats have been at work in an area to the south-east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Elsewhere there has been littleactivity except in the area north-west of Ireland between the Bloody Forelandand Rockall.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.10.   Shipping casualties have been below the average.   U-Boats continue to operate far out in the Atlantic and their attacks were widely spread, althoughnone has been reported during the week from the Freetown area.   Two ships[22626] B 2
were sunk in a homeward-bound convoy, but all other attacks were made onvessels sailing independently. In aircraft attacks in Home Waters two ships were sunk in the Irish Sea and, further afield, two vessels were bombed and sunk off the southern Portuguese coast. One ship wras sunk by mine. One vesselreported being shelled by a surface raider to the west of Ascension Island.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 18th June, 900 ships, including 144 allied and 10 neutral, were convoyed. One battleship&quot; three cruisers, ten armed merchant cruisers, three submarines, six anti-aircraft ships, fifty-nine destroyers and eighty-one sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the14th June were 1,005,633 tons, compared with 812,183 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 795,445 tons for the past ten weeks. Oil imports in 32 tankers totalled 357,988 tons. Mineral imports were 220,895 tons, six shipsbeing fully laden with iron ore, six with  pyrites, one with steel and one withscrap. Timber imports were 23,937 tons and cereals totalled 248,982 tons. other food imports totalled 97,714 tons, compared with 127,822 tons in the week ending the 7th June, and included 48,280 tons of sugar and quantities of cheese, eggs,bacon, sardines and lemons. One oil refinery ship brought in 6,556 tons ofwhale oil.British Minelaying.12. On 16th June H.M. Ships Agamemnon and Menestheus laid 937 minesoff the North Faroes. On the following day H.M.S. Plover laid 100 in the east coast barrier and M.T.Bs. laid 8 of): the Belgian Coast.Minelaying by aircraft was continued off the Channel and French biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. Minelaying by enemy aircraft has been on a moderate scale during theweek, and was chiefly restricted to the East Coast. During the week 20 magneticand 27. acoustic mines have been swept in Home Waters. The mine totals arenow: Magnetic, 1,210; acoustic, 726; contact, 900.Foreign Waters.14. Haifa, on the Syrian coast, has been raided at least twice this week.A few mines have been dropped off the harbour, and H.M. Corvette Hyacinth is carrying out sweeping operations. Since the 1st March, besides those previously reported, ten magnetic and thirteen acoustic mines have been detonated off Malta,In Australian Waters two more mines have been swept up south of Cape Otway,in the western part of Bass Straits, and two others about 40 miles north-east ofSydney. Mines were laid by raider in both these areas early in November lastyear.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.15. The Salzburg (1,756 tons) passed Chanak for the .^aegean on the evening of the 9th June, and is reported to have been torpedoed and sunk with all handsthe next day off Imbros. The Roumanian Jiul (3,127 tons) is reported to havebeen sunk off Crete. The German Norburg (2,392 tons), Hungarian Kassa(1,022 tons) and the Roumanian Tanker Campina (3,032 tons) passed Istanbulduring the morning of the 11th bound for Constanza; the latter re-entered the bosphorus on the 17th for the ^aegean with a cargo of benzine.Italian.16. The Achille (2,415 tons) is reported to have sunk at La Goulette inTunis on the 9th and to be obstructing the wharf and partly blocking the TunisCanal. On the 13th June the Florida II (3,313 tons), which was bombed off Sfaxon the 31st May, was believed to be still afloat.   The Birmania (5,305 tons) is
reported to have been sunk in the harbour at Tripoli. Two tankers, Annarella(5,999 tons) and Dora C (5,843 tons), called at Istanbul on the 11th June on their way to Trieste. The Tanker Utilitas (5,342 tons) entered the Bosphorus bound for the ^aegean on the 18th June fully laden with benzine. Two naval tankers, theTarvisio (5,484 tons) and Urano (5,512 tons), passed Istanbul for Constanza onthe 10th and 11th June respectively, the latter re-entering the Bosphorus on herreturn journey on the 18th June. The Capo Arma (3,175 tons) left Istanbul onthe 15th June for Braila (Roumania). The Tanker Maya (3,867 tons) passedIstanbul on the 17th fully laden with fuel oil.MILITARY SITUATION.Operations.Libya and Egypt.17. Following upon successful raids on enemy landing grounds and M.T.on the 14th June, our forces advanced early on the 15th June. The advance wasmade by three columns; one moving along the coast road towards Halfaya andSollum, a second moving along the escarpment to Halfaya and thence directedupon the Capuzzo-Bir Waer-Musaid area, the third advancing upon Sidi Omar-Bir Hand (5 miles west of Capuzzo) and Sidi Azeiz.18. By 1400 hours (15-6) Capuzzo and Bir Waer had been captured by theescarpment column, but an attack on Halfaya Pass had been repulsed. Bir Handwas strongly held by the enemy, and the third column was unable to capture theposition, although the defences were penetrated and heavy losses inflicted.19. The attack was resumed on the 16th June, and by 0645 hours the coastalcolumn had captured the high ground overlooking Halfaya. Pass. At 1300 hours,however, the pass was still in the hands of the enemy.20. At 075O hours (16-6) part of the escarpment column was two miles west of Sollum, although the town itself was still held by the enemy. Enemy tankcounter attacks north of Sollum and against our troops holding Capuzzo wererepulsed, and a strong enemy column of medium and light tanks was engagedby our armoured troops 3 miles north of Sidi Omar and suffered heavy casualties.21. During the 16th June there was a considerable flow of enemy M.T.eastwards and the reinforcements thus brought up from the reserve areaspresumably took part in the strong counter attacks by armoured forces against our troops in the Capuzzo area and east of Sidi Omar on the 17th June, whenconsiderable casualties were inflicted on the enemy.22.   Our troops are now withdrawing to positions east of Halfaya,Syria.. 23. Our advance into Syria has progressed slowly, strong resistance beingencountered in all sectors from the Vichy French. The Free French, supportedby British units, have maintained their pressure in the Damascus area, Aartouxhas been captured, and an attack is being developed against the western outskirts of Damascus. In the central sector our troops had advanced through Merdjayounto Jezzine, where severe casualties were inflicted on the Vichy French, but on16th June a mobile Vichy French force succeeded in recapturing Kuneitra,thereby holding up our advance and causing a withdrawal from Merdjayoun.Kuneitra has been recaptured and Merdjayoun has been surrounded by our troops.24. In the coastal sector our troops have advanced four miles north of Sidon.A abyssinia.25. In the north, sporadic patrol and patriot activity continue in theGondar area, where the further advance of our forces has been held up and therelative positions maintained.
26. In the south, our troops have succeeded in advancing fairly rapidly, inspite of bad roads, towards Jimma, from which we are now only separated byabout twelve miles. Jimma itself has little importance, either strategically orpolitically, and the occupation of this town would not necessarily bring to a closemilitary operations in this area. Indications that the enemy is withdrawing from Lechemti have now been confirmed, and our own forward troops are keeping in touch, although the bad state of the roads in this area is hampering ourmovement.27. General Pralormo, who had escaped with the remnants of the 24th(Italian) Division numbering about 2,000 men into the mountainous countryto the south-west of Soddu, finally surrendered on 14th June, after a fortnightof constant harassing by the patriots.28. In Eritrea, the landing ground at Macaca, eight miles north-west ofAssab, was captured on 13th June in a serviceable condition.Intelligence.Libya.29. The German forces in Cyrenaica consist of the 15th armoured division and the 5th Light Armoured (Colonial) Division, each of which has onetank regiment. It was estimated on the 14th June that, after allowing forcasualties, the Germans had 175 medium tanks, 105 light tanks and 42 armoured cars in this area.30.   The dispositions of the Italian forces in Cyrenaica are believed to be : 102 (Trento) Motorised Division : Capuzzo-Sollum area.132 (Ariete) Armoured Division : Tobruk area.27 (Brescia) Division : Tobruk17 (Pavia) Division : Concentrating Tobruk area.25 (Bologna) Division : Barce.31. These divisions are believed all to be under strength owing to casualties;the tank strength of 132 Armoured Division is estimated at only 18 medium and46 light tanks.32. The main task of the Italian forces appears to be to contain Tobruk,and there are few reports of their activity in the forward area.Syria.33. There are still no fresh clues to German intentions in the eastern mediterranean or Middle East. German Air Force personnel appear to have leftSyria, and it is reported that a number of other Germans are leaving the countrythrough Turkey. It is possible, however, that German infiltration may againhave begun, for, as French resistance stiffens, the likelihood of active german participation in the Syrian operations increases.The German Threat to Ritssia.34. Early in March 1941 German troops began to move towards the Sovietfrontier in German-occupied Poland, and since the end of the Balkan campaignfurther concentrations have taken place in North Norway, Finland, Poland,Bukovina and Moldavia.35. Four divisions are now believed to be stationed in and to the north of narvik. Numerous large transports have been moving by sea up the coast of norway, and troops appear to have been moved north from Narvik to Alta andthen east to Kirkenes.36.   One mountain division is reported to have moved south down the Arctichighway towards the area Sodankyla-Rovaniemi.   Elements of an S.S. division from North Norway have reinforced S.S. units already in Finland.   A further- division is now disembarking at Finnish ports and is expected to move toRovaniemi, and a fourth division may be on its way to Finland.37. It is reported that the concentration area on the German-Soviet frontierextends in depth from the Russian frontier westwards as far as Plock, Lodz and
Cracow. It is not as yet possible to indicate the comparative weights of theconcentrations in different parts of this area, but the main preliminary concentra-tion of mechanised forces seems to be in the Cracow area of South Poland, whereit is estimated that there are at least 16 divisions, including two armoured andone motorised.38. German troops are reported as having moved into Bukovina northwardsfrom Moldavia and eastwards from Hungary via Oradea-Bistriza.39. Ever since the conclusion of the Balkan campaign there have been reportsof German troops moving northwards from Bulgaria to Bucharest and thence toMoldavia.40. In round figures, the distribution of German divisions is estimated tobe as follows : Finland ................. 2-4East Prussia and Poland   ...       ...       ... 76Bukovina and Moldavia     ...       ...       ...       15-20Spain.41. In the light of all the available evidence, it would seem that there arestill only seven German divisions in the Bordeaux-Hendaye area, one of thesebeing armoured and one a motorised division. The latter may also contain sometanks. Dumps of provisions, fuel and ammunition are apparently still beingaccumulated, and a &quot; dress rehearsal&quot; of traffic mobilisation in the Hendaye area was organised recently in connection with German army manoeuvres.42. There is no evidence that German operations against Spain areimminent.Greece.4 43. The Italians were expected to take over from the Germans at various points, including Athens and the Island of Chios, on the 15th-16th June.Roumania.44.   The Roumanian G.H.Q. has left Bucharest for Moldavia.45. Confirmation has now been received of the mobilisation of theRoumanian armed forces, which is stated to have begun on the 29th May. these measures were to be completed by the 12th June, and stringent regulation of rail and road travel has been introduced. Petrol trains are believed to be almostentirely suspended on account of the reservation of locomotives for othertransport.AIR SITUATION.General Review.46. The most noticeable feature of the week&apos;s. air operations in theMetropolitan Area has been the small scale of the enemy&apos;s night bombing ascompared with our own. Against the enemy&apos;s long-range night bomber effort of260 sorties during the period, Bomber Command operations were the heaviest yetrecorded. The Command flew 1,300 sorties by night, and dropped nearly 1,800tons of bombs, mainly on targets in the Ruhr. Although bad weather and theheavy casualties suffered during the May moon period may have accounted forthe comparative inactivity of the enemy at the beginning of this month, these factors are not adequate to account for its continuance. It is possible that reasonsmay be found in the enemy&apos;s desire to concentrate on operations against russian the near future, and German air concentrations on the Russian frontiers are reported. The Germans may also desire to launch simultaneous heavy air attacks against the United Kingdom, in the event of war with Russia, in order to prove that they are capable of large-scale air operations on two fronts.Our air forces conducted the most intense and successful operations in supportof land operations in Libya, and continue to support the offensive in Syria.
47. Reinforcements and the prospect of offensive action now appear to haveinstilled into the French Air Force an offensive spirit which lias not hitherto been in evidence.Germany and Occupied Territory.General.48. Bomber Command despatched 165 sorties by day and 1,300 by night,and Coastal Command flew a number of bombing sorties, which are included inthe figures given under Coastal Operations. Fighter Command carried out heavyoffensive sweeps over North-East France.Day.49. On four days, Blenheims of Bomber and Coastal Commands successfullybombed an aerodrome at St. Omer and encampments in woods nearby, chemical works and Power Station at Chocques, near Bethune, and Gasworks at Boulogne.Covering sweeps and. close support by our fighters during these operations involved a total of more than fifty squadrons. Large numbers of enemy fighters attempted to intercept, particularly during the attack on Chocques, when 150 aircraft were encountered. We destroyed 38 enemy fighters, with 19 more probably destroyed and 22 damaged; twenty of our fighter aircraft failed to return, though the pilotsof four were rescued. From daylight operations, 14 of our bombers are missing,including aircraft of Coastal Command. Other attacks carried out during day-light hours are reported under Coastal Operations.Night.50. Every night of the week aircraft of Bomber Command carried outattacks on a considerable scale against objectives in Germany and in occupied territory. A high proportion of these aircraft succeeded in attacking their primary targets, which were mainly railway and industrial centres in the Ruhrand Rhine districts.51. Although good weather was general during these operations, visibilitywas in many instances impaired by thick ground mist, which restricted theobservation of results to the sighting of bomb-flashes and the glow of numerousfires seen through the haze. The following totals of the bombs released on theprincipal targets gives some indication of the weight of our offensive : Cologne: attacked on 4 nights : 255 tons of H.E. and 12,820 I.B.dusseldorf: attacked on 3 nights : 170 tons of H.E. and 12.460 I.B.Hctmm: attacked on 1 night: 111 tons of H.E. and 1,800 LB.Osnabruck: attacked on 1 night: 91 tons of FLE.Bremen: attacked on 1 night: 91 tons of H.E. and 2,440 LB.Schwerte: attacked on 2 nights : 87 tons of FLE. and 4,500 LB.Hanover.- attacked on 2 nights : 54 tons of H.E. and 800 LB.Duisburg: attacked on 2 nights : 53 tons of H.E. and 8,364 LB.Soest: attacked on 1 night: 46 tons of H.E. and 700 LB.Huls: attacked on 1 night: 25 tons of H.E. and 1,100 LB.52. Boulogne was bombed on three nights, Rotterdam on two and Dunkirkonce. The naval dockyard at Brest (where the battle-cruisers Scharnhorst andGneisenau and the cruiser Prinz Eugen are still berthed) sustained heavy attacks on two nights, a total of 240 tons of H.E. bombs being released, some of whichburst very close to the position of these targets. Haze and a heavy smoke-screenprevented detailed observation.53. From all our night operations 22 Bombers are. missing, including&apos;3 operating under Coastal Command.54. Flavocs and Hurricanes continued to attack enemy aerodromes, in Franceand, in the course of these operations, destroyed one Me. 110.United Kingdom.55. Fighter Command flew L402 patrols, involving 3,940 sorties, by day,and 651 patrols, involving 957 sorties, by night.   The latter totals include dusk
and dawn patrols. German operations both by day and night have again been ona relatively small scale.56. On several days, enemy fighter patrols crossed the coasts of Kent andSussex but made only shallow penetrations, except on the 16th, when a fewreached the Canterbury and Ashford areas. In addition to the casualties inflicted on the enemy in the operations over France, two Me. 109 fighters were shotclown over Dover on the 13th.57. During the week, about 260 enemy long-range bombers operated by nightover and round our coasts. The majority were again engaged in anti-shippingactivities and about 100 are suspected of minelaying. On the night of the13th/14th, about 70 operated over the Eastern and Southern counties withoutapparent concentration on any particular objective and, on the 16th/ 17th, therewas a little ineffective bombing in the west. There was increased activity on thepart of enemy night fighters over the East Coast, where attempts were made to intercept our returning bombers. Twelve enemy aircraft were destroyed by ournight fighters (seven on the 16th/17th) and two by anti-aircraft fire.Coastal Operations.58. Coastal Command flew 293 patrols, involving 476 sorties, and providedescorts for 116 convoys, involving 394 additional sorties. Shipping protectionpatrols carried out by Fighter Command totalled 780 and involved 1,744 sorties.59. Following the sighting by a Coastal Command Blenheim, at aboutmidnight on the 12th, of enemy naval units off the coast of Norway, twentyaircraft of the same Command were despatched to attack this force, whichconsisted of one pocket battleship (possibly the Lutzow) and five destroyers with air escort. One aircraft scored a hit with a torpedo amidships on the battleship,and a second aircraft claimed a hit, though the result of its attack was not seenowing to the smoke which surrounded the target. The enemy force was subsequently shadowed by other aircraft until, on the afternoon of the following day, it was reported approximately 35 miles north-.west of the Skaw (Skagerrak).One Beaufort was lost in these operations. The battleship was protected on itsretreat by Me. 110&apos;s sent from North-West Germany for the purpose.60. Bomber Command continued their activities against enemy shipping offoccupied territory, and claim to have sunk on one day a 4,000-ton merchant vessel,another of 1,000 tons and an E-boat. Coastal Command aircraft on the same dayhit a 5,000-ton merchant vessel, causing the ship to list. On another day a patrolvessel and a merchant vessel were hit, and two fishing boats sunk. The resultsof other promising attacks were unobserved.61. A total of 28 aircraft from Bomber and Coastal Commands weredetailed to lay mines, principally off Brest.62. Sea mining was carried out by 115 enemy aircraft, mainly off the east coast. Liverpool and the South-Western coasts did not receive the attentionwhich is usually directed to these areas.63. Night armed reconnaissances of shipping were made with regularityover south-western waters and off the east coasts of England and Scotland.Enemy air attacks against shipping off our coasts, which were slightly below theaverage, are included under Naval Situation. An abortive operation by theCondor unit against a convoy is reported under paragraph 64. Enemyreconnaissance activity north of Trondheim continues to increase. It is improbable that this increased activity in extreme Northern Norway is directed against the United Kingdom.Gibraltar.64. The usual anti-submarine and convoy patrols were flown from Gibraltar.On the 15th, a Catalina flying-boat attacked a number of He. 111&apos;s and Focke-Wulfs of the Condor unit, which unsuccessfully bombed a convoy 180 miles south of Cape St. Vincent. One, at least, is known to have crashed in Portugal,and three are believed to have been damaged.   ,[22626] c
65. Bombs were dropped in the bay at Gibraltar on the night of the12th/13th by an aircraft, which left on a northerly course. Single Frenchreconnaissance aircraft have been reported over or near Gibraltar on several days.Central Mediterranean.66. Reconnaissance flights from Malta have covered the coasts of sicily and Tunis, the iEgean Sea and Naples. Two Blenheims were despatched toattack a merchant vessel of about 5,000 tons off Pantellaria, and scored five direct hits. The attack was carried out from a very low level, and one of the aircraft was lost after striking the ship&apos;s mast. Swordfish, of the Fleet Air Arm, havealso attacked shipping, and on the 13th bombed Tripoli, causing fires to breakout in the harbour area.67. Italian aircraft have approached Malta on several occasions, but therehave been no serious attacks, though on two nights bombs were dropped without serious results. On the 12th, nine fighters and two rescue float-planes were destroyed by Hurricanes, of which three were lost.Egypt and Cyrenaica.68. Successful attacks were made on Benghazi by Wellingtons on each night of the week. In the course of these, large fires, followed by persistent explosions,were seen to break out in the harbour area, and at least three ships were hit, twobeing set on fire. Enemy aerodromes and landing grounds east of Benghazi wererepeatedly attacked both by day and night, and eleven aircraft were burnt out atGazala on the 14th.,69. After the start of our offensive, Hurricanes, Tomahawks and Blenheimfighters maintained standing patrols over our land forces, and carried out con-tinuous attacks against enemy mechanised columns; on the 17th, 193 such sorties were flown. On the 14th, Hurricanes destroyed or disabled 23 M.T. vehicles and3 light tanks between Gazala and Capuzzo and, on the following day, Hurricanesand Blenheims put out of action 25 M.T. vehicles and a light tank. On the 15th&apos;,Hurricanes intercepted 8 Ju. 88&apos;s, forcing them to jettison their bombs, and, twoclays later, shot down 10 out of 35 Ju. 87&apos;s which were attempting to dive-bombour troops; later in the day, two more dive-bombers and six fighters were destroyed. In the course of other air combats during the week at. least 5 enemy aircraft were shot down.   During these operations we have lost 23 fighters.70. Enemy aircraft bombed Tobruk on the 12th, losing one of their number,and doing no damage of consequence. They have also patrolled our night landing grounds in the hope of intercepting night bombers, but only succeeded in bombing-dummy landing grounds and flarepaths.71. About 25 Italian long-range bombers and 25 short-range fighters are probably being transferred from Italy to Libya. Italian air operations haveconsisted mainly in standing patrols over back areas and aerodromes, though someescorts were provided for dive-bombers and some Italian Ju. 87 dive-bombersprobably operated.Dodecanese.72. Calato aerodrome (Rhodes) was attacked on three nights by Wellingtonsfrom Egypt and three aircraft were probably destroyed, while the many fireswhich broke out indicate the probable destruction of others.Syria.73. Blenheims from Palestine and Mosul attacked aerodromes at Rayakand Aleppo, where runways were damaged and at least three enemy aircraftburnt out. Harbours and aerodromes in Syria were constantly reconnoitred andsome opposition was encountered from French fighters. Close support was givento our land forces by bombing and machine-gun attacks in the Kuneitra andDamascus and a number of M.T. vehicles were destroyed.
74. On the 13th, 14th and 15th, bombers escorted by fighters attacked our naval forces operating off Sidon. Five enemy aircraft were destroyed during these operations by our escorting fighters, and seven damaged. These operations and those of the naval aircraft are reported in paragraph 4.75. Enemy aircraft made abortive attacks on Cyprus and Haifa on the13th and 14th. An attack was also made on our landing ground 125 miles south-west of Rutbah, where a trainer aircraft was destroyed. French fighters havebeen active, but have suffered considerable casualties from our fighters and grounddefences.76. There is still no evidence of German aircraft being in Syria, but. theFrench have been further reinforced by six Glenn-Martins and seventeenDewoitine fighters.East Africa.77. Many successful bombing attacks have been made in support of our land forces by units based in the Sudan and in Kenya. Several direct hits have beenmade on important bridges in the Gimma sector and fires were started amongtransport and in buildings. Our aircraft have dropped ammunition to advancedtroops and have distributed leaflets. Three Wellesleys attacked and damaged two italian fighters on the 17th, suffering some damage themselves. Aircraft of theSouth African Air Force and Free French Forces have taken part in these operations.West Africa.78. On the 9th June a French Glenn-Martin operating from Senegal carriedout a prolonged photographic reconnaissance of Gambia, covering Bathurst, CapeSt. Mary, the Abulo water-works and the Jeswang aerodrome at heights between200 and 8,000 feet, and on the 13th June a second Glenn-Martin flew overFreetown at heights of 100 to 3,000 feet. The latter aircraft, from a unit basedat Conakry, subsequently crashed in the sea, two survivors from the crew of fourbeing picked up by a Norwegian vessel. Another Norwegian vessel, thes.s. Liss, had on the preceding day been engaged by a French coastal battery and machine-gunned by a single French aircraft off the Isle de Los, 15 miles fromConakry.Russia.79. There are indications that the Germans have deployed some 300 aircraft on the Russian frontiers, mostly transferred from the aegean, but detaileddispositions have not yet been established. The absence of aircraft in Finlandmakes it unlikely that offensive operations are contemplated from this direction.80. There is little information of Russian counter-measures. The SovietAir Force is numerically very strong, but it achieved little distinction in the russo--Finnish war, when the bomber and fighter tactics of the Russian airmenwere most inefficient. However, the Soviet Air Force is now known to possessa considerable number of modern fighters of the I. 18 type, which have a per-formance comparable to the Hurricane. Apart from these, practically all types of Russian military aircraft are markedly inferior in performance to corres-ponding types possessed by the Germans.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.By Day.81. Despite improved weather conditions enemy activity during daylighthas been negligible. On five days minor incidents, mainly in Cornwall, Devonand East Anglia, were reported.By Night.82. There has been only slight bombing this week except on the night ofthe 13th, when a minor concentration was made on the Medway area.[22626] c 2

On the night of the 13th, while the mainconcentration was over the Medway area and a small attack developed on thePortsmouth district, bombing was also scattered round the east and south coasts-from Lincolnshire to Hampshire. Damage was almost entirely confined to house property, and there was no incident which calls for special mention. On the night of the 14th there was minor bombing in the district between Bristol, Swindonand the Gloucestershire-Herefordshire border. On the night of the 15th June,bombs were dropped at Christchurch and Medstead in Hampshire. On the night of the 16th, a few bombing incidents occurred in the neighbourhood of Gloucesterand of Hull. At Cheltenham the main railway line was damaged. On the night of the 17th, bombing occurred in Yorkshire, when a number of people were trappedand a hospital badly damaged at Bridlington. On the night of the 18th, someH.E. bombs were dropped in the vicinity of Woodfox landing ground, nearStamford, and at Caister in Norfolk.
