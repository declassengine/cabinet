THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1941.SECRET. ^  / Copy No.W.P. (41) 141.June 25, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES TO TURKEY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Chairman of the Committee for the Co-ordination of Allied supplies in his paper W.P. (41) 138 of the 20th June asked for guidance on the question ofsupplies to Turkey in the light of our increasing needs and of recent events inTurkey.Lord Hankey has himself, in paragraph 8 of his paper, set out some of thepossible results of a reduction in supplies, and I agree with all that is said inthat paragraph. In addition, I would point out that, under the Anglo-turkish treaty of Mutual Assistance of October 1939, we are under an obligation toprovide Turkey with war material. The French were under an equal obligation,and when they collapsed that obligation was transferred to ourselves. We havedone our best hitherto to provide this material, though our deliveries have notbeen up to schedule. If now we were to cut off these supplies we should, of course,be failing to fulfil our obligations under the Treaty, and that at a moment when we have been successful in obtaining from the Turks assurances that the Anglo-Turkish Treaty is safeguarded under the preamble to the recent Turco-german agreement. More important perhaps than the actual failure to fulfil the pro-visions of the Treaty would be the results on the mentality of the Turks. our ambassador in Angora has consistently advised us that to show mistrust of turkish intentions is the best method we can adopt of driving them quickly intothe German camp. If we cut off a large proportion of their military supplies theTurks will make one of two assumptions, either (a) that we have lost all trust in them, or(b) that we are in such a difficult military position that we cannot afford to let them have any important supplies.In many ways (b) would have almost as damaging an effect on our position vis-a-vis the Turks as would (a). Moreover, as Lord Hankey points out, a furtherresult would be that the Turks would at once turn to the Germans for their military supplies, and this would in its turn encourage the Germans to make further demands, e.g., dismissal of British personnel, rejection of British pre-emptive purchases, passage of war material, suppression of British news, &amp;c.From the purely military standpoint it seems doubtful whether the possibledisadvantages of cutting off military supplies do not outweigh the advantages.If we fail to fulfil our Treaty obligations and give Turkey the impression thatwe have lost all confidence in her, would she not quickly become a mere satelliteof Germany ?  Might it not mean that at the first German demand for the passage11412   [22641]
of troops and war material the Turks would give in ? If so, this small additionto our own supplies in the Middle East might be more than offset by theappearance of the Germans in strength on the Turkish-Syrian frontier. on balance, therefore, it would seem worth while attempting to keep the Turks inplay by the modest price represented by the present small deliveries of warmaterial.There is the further point that if we lose Turkey all the Arab countries, iran and Egypt will be affected. Of course this argument cuts both ways, and if ourposition at Suez is to be seriously endangered through lack of the small supplieswe now send to Turkey, that would be an argument on the other side, but it seemsdifficult to believe that this is the case.Much the same arguments apply in the case of American supplies, althoughthe Americans have, of course, no treaty obligations to consider as have HisMajesty&apos;s Government. But if the Turks believe that they are being abandonedby the United States they may well cancel the present arrangement wherebythey deliver to us their whole output of chrome which we are now sending to america, where it is vitally needed for the execution of both American andBritish armament orders.Meanwhile, the United States Government have now informed Lord Halifaxthat in view of the German-Turkish agreement they feel they must re-examineat once the most unusual facilities at present enjoyed by the Turkish Governmentin the United States, not merely for purchasing United States goods but forprocuring supplies under the Lease-Lend Act. At present orders are beingexecuted for Turkey for much war material, including aircraft, tractors and machine tools. They are inclined, therefore, to revise their treatment of Turkishorders (a) by giving them very low priority; and (b) by saying that in some casesno supplies were available besides what the United States required for theirown needs. The United States Government, in making this communication toLord ,Halifax, have asked for the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Ouranswer will clearly be governed by the decision that we ourselves take regardingthe continuance of military supplies from this country to Turkey.My conclusions are : (a) That the wisest course will be to maintain military supplies to Turkeyon their present level and until we see how matters develop as aresult of the Turco-German agreement, If in spite of all our efforts to show the Turks that we continue to trust them it becomes plain that Turkey is unable or unwilling to resist increasing german pressure, then, but only then, should we cut down these supplies.(&amp;) In consequence, the present priority of Turkey should be maintained andthe present War Cabinet policy as regards both military and civilsupplies should continue to be followed.(c) That we should inform the United States Government accordingly and ask them to conform their action under the Lease-Lend Act toour own.A. E.Foreign Office, June 25, 1941.
