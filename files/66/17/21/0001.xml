(41) 148.June 28, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.FUNCTIONS OF THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.1. IT is undesirable to detail in advance precisely the functions of theMinister of State when in the Middle East. It is sufficient to say that he will represent the War Cabinet on the spot and will carry out its policy and use its authority for that purpose.2. To enable him to discharge these functions, he will be fully informed ofthe approved policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government on all major issues. If anyquestion should arise on which he requires special guidance, he will, providedthat there is time, refer the matter Home. He will in any case report constantlyto His Majesty&apos;s Government. His official channel of communication with HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be the Secretary of the War Cabinet, through the medium of the office of Flis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo and the ForeignOffice. He will also communicate directly with the Prime Minister and Ministerof Defence by personal telegrams whenever convenient.3. The principal task of the Minister of State will be to ensure a successfulconduct of the operations in the Middle East by (a) relieving the Commanders-in-Chief as far as possible of those extraneousresponsibilities with which they have hitherto been burdened; and(5) giving Commanders-in-Chief that political guidance which has not hitherto been available locally;(c) settling promptly matters within the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment but involving several local authorities.[22658]
4.   Examples of (a) above are: (i) Relations with the Free French,(ii) Relations with the Emperor of Abyssinia.(iii) The administration of occupied enemy territory.(iv) Propaganda and subversive warfare,(v) Finance and economic warfare.(vi) General supervision  over the  activities of the Intendant-General,including all matters locally connected with  supplies from theUnited States of America,(vii) Disposal of prisoners of war.On these matters the Minister of State will of course refer home where necessary on important issues of policy and will receive from time to timedirections from His Majesty&apos;s Government.5. To enable him to discharge the functions in paragraph 3 (b) above, hewill preside over meetings of the Commanders-in-Chief whenever they so desireor he has any point to raise.6. On the diplomatic and political side he will co-ordinate so far as isnecessary the policy of His Majesty&apos;s representatives in Egypt, the Sudan,Palestine and Trans-Jordan, Iraq (which will, however, remain for operationalpurposes under the Government of India), Abyssinia, British Somaliland,occupied enemy territories (Eritrea and Italian Somaliland), Syria (whenoccupied) and Cyprus. This instruction in no way detracts from the existingindividual responsibilities of His Majesty&apos;s representatives in the aboveterritories, or their official relationships with their respective departments athome.7. He will, as soon as he feels in a position to do so, submit reports to thePrime Minister on the above instructions and his requirements of staff to enable him to implement them.W. S. C.June 28, 1941.
