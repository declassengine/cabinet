(41) 370)June 12, 1941/TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 93)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon June 5th, to12 noon June 12th,1941[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.Units of the Mediterranean Fleet nre operating off the coast of Syria.An enemy cruiser has been successfully attacked by our aircraft off the southof Norway.Our shipping losses daring the week are below the average.Home Waters.2. The Finnish Winha (3,331 tons), bound for Petsamo, was intercepted inthe North-Western Approaches and sent into Kirkwall.On the 10th June ELM. Corvette Pintail was mined and sunk east of the humber while escorting a northbound convoy.   There were twenty-two survivors.During the evening of the 12th June an aircraft on night patrol sighted anenemy cruiser escorted by destroyers off the Lister Light (South Norway). Air-craft were sent out to attack and at the time of going to press reports indicatethat one hit with a torpedo was obtained on the cruiser.During the week approximately 20,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by aircraft of the Coastal and Bomber Command.North Atlantic.3. After the recent operations against the Bismarck, naval units encounter-tered and sank five enemy supply ships and an armed trawler, which probablywere intended to supply the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen while operating against our trade.Mediterranean.4. - &apos;On the 3rd June H.M. M.T.B. 215, on patrol from Cyprus, interceptedan auxiliary schooner purporting to be the Turkish I.r.a. Kardeshler. The vessel was set on fire and a heavy explosion corroborated other evidence that she wascarrying petrol.A force of cruisers and destroyers is employed supporting the left flank ofour army in Syria. A special service battalion in H.M.S. Glengyle was landed at Quaimiye, north of the river Litaiii, on the night of the 8th/9th June. Onthe following day French destroyers off Sidon attacked H.M. Destroyer Janus,which was hit in the boiler room and disabled, but was subsequently towed intoHaifa.  The French destroyers were chased into Beirut by three of our destroyers.On the 30th May ELM. Submarine Triumph torpedoed the Italian armed merchant cruiser Ramb in Benghazi Harbour, and later sank an armed trawlerand two empty sailing vessels in the Gulf of Sidra. On the 3rd June H.M.Submarine Unique sank a laden 1,000-ton merchant vessel in Lampedusa harbour.Early on the morning of the 28th May a party from H.M. SubmarineUpright carried out a -landing four miles south-west of Punto Stilo Light,Calabria, and blew up the railway line.On the 8th June H.M. Submarine Torbay torpedoed the French tankerAlberta (3,357 tons) off the Dardanelles. The tanker was bound from Naples toConstanza.During the week six French merchant ships (upwards of 20,000 tons) west-ward and five (28,000 tons) eastward have passed Gibraltar under escort.East Indies.5. The capture of Assab (southern Eritrea) has been carried out successfullyby a combined operation from Aden, and complete surprise was achieved. the prisoners taken included two Generals and one Naval Captain.Anti-Submarine  Operations.6. In the North-Western Approaches two attacks by surface vessels and fiveby aircraft have been carried out without visible results. In the Gibraltar areathere have been three surface and three aircraft attacks. H.M. Sloop Wellingtonclaimed two hits by gunfire on the U-Boat which had previously attacked a convoyin this area.
Enemy Intelligence.German.7. Photographic reconnaissance of Kiel.on 4th June showed Admiral Scheerand the Hipper Class cruiser still present in the same berths as when they werelast observed. The two battle cruisers and the Prinz Eugen remain in Brest, andthere is evidence that the new battleship Tirpitz is still in the Baltic, where sheis said to have been carrying out gunnery exercises.U-Boats.8. In the period under review there have been about 17 German U-Boatsat work in the Western and North-Western Approaches. A large number ofthese appear to have been operating in an area about 600 miles east of Cape Race(Newfoundland). Two German U-Boats have been reported to the westward ofthe Bloody Foreland and southward of Rockall, and, although vigorously huntedby air and surface forces, have succeeded in sinking two independently routedships. It is also probable that two U-Boats have passed south of Iceland (C),towards the western area described above, and that one or two have gonenorthward round Iceland (C) to the Denmark Straits.Of the 6 or 7 U-Boats which have been at work in the latitude of Freetownand to the south of it, it is probable that three are now on passage homewards toports in the Bay of Biscay. There have been no signs of any reliefs bound forthis southern area.Italian U-Boats have been operating between Madeira and Gibraltar.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. Early in the week under review U-Boats and Focke-Wulf aircraft attacked one of our convoys to the westward of Cape St. Vincent, resulting in theloss of three ships. U-Boats have also attacked shipping in the Freetown area,in the North-Western Approaches and in the West Atlantic. Casualties by bombing have occurred to shipping on the south and east coasts, off St. David&apos;sHead and to the west of the Faroes.10. According to the information available up to the 11th June, shipping losses in May (details of Which are given in &quot;Appendix I) were 88 ships and11 small craft totalling 461,231 tons. Fifty-seven ships (323,001 tons) were sunk by U-boats, the majority in the Freetown area and in the West Atlantic, twenty-three ships and ten small craft by aircraft, four ships by mine, one ship by raider,and one ship and one small craft by unknown cause. In addition, 19 ships and5 small craft totalling 85,046 tons, which are included in Appendix I, were reported in May but lost in previous months.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 11th June 877 ships, including 161 allied and 22 neutral, were convoyed. Two battleships, three cruisers, eight armed merchant cruisers, two submarines, fifty-six destroyers and sixty-one sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties. Since the beginning of the war, 67,302ships have been convoyed, of which 343 have been lost by enemy action.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the7th June totalled 812,183 tons, compared with 1,008,485 tons during the previousweek. Oil imports in 27 tankers totalled 287,135 tons. Mineral imports were158,582 tons, of which 133,338 tons were steel, pig iron, scrap iron and iron ore.Timber and pulp imports were 12,498 tons and cereal imports 163,326 tons.Other food imports amounted to 127,822 tons, of which the principal commoditieswere : sugar, 32,744 tons; refrigerated and tinned meats, bacon and hams, 27,290tons; dried and tinned fruit, 12,853 tons; cocoa, 4,344 tons; butter, 3,900 tons;tea, 3,555 tons; eggs, 1,107 tons. The Southern Express (12,398 tons) brought11,600 tons of whale oil from South Georgia. There were also satisfactoryimports of aircraft and parts, rubber and machinery.British Minelaying.12. During the week about 1,000 mines have been laid in the Iceland-FaroesChannel, and motor torpedo boats laid eight mines off the Belgian coast. Mine-laying by aircraft has been carried out off French Biscay ports, in the Baltic and north Sea ports.[22611] &apos; B
Enemy Minelaying, British Miriesweeping.Home Waters.13. Enemy minelaying by aircraft has been on a reduced scale during thepast week, probably owing to bad weather. The Thames Estuary was raided onthe night of the 4th/5th June, and minelaying may have been carried out as farnorth as the Humber. Mines were laid of! Harwich on the night of the 8th/9thand off Milford Haven on the night of the 10th/ 11th June.A considerable number of mines have been swept during the week, particu-larly in the Thames and Medway Approaches, where twenty acoustic mines weredetonated in about four hours. Altogether six magnetic and ufty-two acousticmines have been detonated in Home Waters during the week.The mine totals are now : magnetic 1,180, acoustic 686, and contact 883.Foreign Waters.14. When Alexandria was raided during the night of the 7th/8th Juneseveral mines were dropped on the town and seven in the harbour, of which fivehave been detonated by sweepers.Lagos, Nigeria, has been closed since a dredger was sunk following an explosion on the 4th June. It. has not yet been decided whether the explosionwas caused by a mine or torpedo, but sweepers are being sent to search the area.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.15. It has been reported that the Alicante (2,140 tons) was lost before september 1940.The Germans are reported to be making great efforts to secure shipping,particularly tankers and small sailing ships, for use in the Black Sea and the-aegean. Three Roumanian ships are said to be fitting out as armed merchant cruisers in the iEgean. The Roumanian Carmen Sylva (1,601 tons) is reportedto have been sunk while carrying troops to Crete. The Bulgarian Knyaguinya,Maria Luisa (3,821 tons) is said to have been lost in the Piraeus.A secret source has reported that the Rio Grande (6,062 tons), which sailed from a Brazilian port last October, arrived at Hambui&apos;g before the end ofFebruary with prisoners on board from a German raider.Italian.16. The Augustus, 30,418 tons, Roma, 30,631 tons, and Vulcania,24,469 tons, have recently been reported in Genoa. The Saturnia, 24:A70 tons,arrived there on the 28th Mav and was said to be about to embark troops forTripoli.Three Italian tankers, the Annarella, 5,999 tons, Dora C, 5,843 tons, andStrombo, 5,232 tons, assembled at Valona and passed Chanak bound for the black sea on the 3rd June. The Strombo remained for some days at Istanbul, having a 15-foot hole on the port side both above and below the water-line. It was sub-sequently established that she had been torpedoed 25 miles off Cape Helles. the tanker Giuseppina Ghirardi, 3,319 tons, passed Istanbul bound from Salonikafor the Black Sea on the 2nd June and re-entered the Bosphorus on her return journey on the 8th June. The Capo Arma, 3,175 tons, arrived at Istanbul on the5th June.MILITARY SITUATION.Operations.Syria.17. On 8th June our troops, with Free French troops on their right,advanced into Syria in four columns. French opposition was encountered, but by10th June we had reached a line Kiswe (15 miles South of Damascus)-Merdjayum-mouth of River Litani. Merdjayum, which guards the valleybetween the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, was captured by our troops during the afternoon of 11th June, and by the evening of that day our left column wasveported to be one mile south of Sidon.
Iraq.     . JMi18. After demonstrations in Baghdad, involving considerable looting and civilian casualties, the general situation vis-a-vis the Iraqis is improving. Inthe Basra area Iraqi troops, on orders from Baghdad, have left Kern a and friendly relations have been established with local Iraqi commanders at Ur.19. Our troops have reached Kirkuk and Mosul, where news of our entry into Syria has had a quietening effect. On the 8th June a small column proceeded to Tel Kotchek, on the Syrian border; it received a friendly welcome and, findingno signs of German activity, returned to Mosul.On the 9th June, after passing through Hadeitha, a small flying column wasin contact with insurgent elements at Abu Kemal.Tobruk.20. There is little change in the ground situation. Enemy artillery has been active west of the perimeter, and one enemy tank was immobilised by our artiller\fire in the El Adem sector.A abyssinia.21. Our forces have succeeded in crossing the River Omo against enemyopposition. We now have two forces advancing on Gimma, of which the northerncolumn has reached Socorro. On the line of advance of the southern column work is proceeding on a pontoon bridge over the River Omo and on the clearance of a road block 12 miles west of the crossing. Heavy rain is adding to the difficultyof the work.Far East.22. 56 Indian Field Company arrived in Burma on the 7th June. Thiscompletes the reinforcement programme from India of three battalions (13 IndianInfantry Brigade), two mountain batteries and one field company.23.   The following Coast Defences have now been installed : Cocos (Keeling) Isles : Two 6-inch naval guns.Lutong (Sarawak) : Two 6-inch naval guns.Christmas Is. : One 6-inch naval gun.Intelligence.Iraq.24. Rashid Ali&apos;s propaganda has left a deep impression in certain quarters.His agents still control a large section of the armed forces, and are sedulouslyspreading the belief that the Germans will again be in Iraq within the nextfew weeks.The army has by no means lost cohesion and discipline. Its present temperis sullen, and until the unreliable officers are replaced by trustworthy men itsItaly.25. The present total first-line strength of the Italian army is estimated at,150,000 men, comprising 74 divisions (of which three are armoured), located asfollows : Italy : 25 divisions (including Frontier Guard).Albania : 16 divisions.Greece : 12 divisions.Yugoslavia : 12 divisions.Dodecanese : 1 division (over strength).Libya: 8 divisions (including Frontier Guard).Roumania.26. The Roumanian army is at present mobilized at a strength of sometwenty divisions, sixteen of which are reported to be concentrating on theRussian frontier. The evacuation of the civilian population from this region and an order to distributors to ship three months&apos; oil stocks to Moldavia,[22611] &apos; b 2
Bukovina and Northern Dobruja by the 15th June appear to indicate that these areas will be entirely taken up wnb troop movements after that date.Germany. (27. Evidence of German preparations for military action against russia is steadily accumulating, and over one-third of the German army is now disposedon the Russian frontiers. In addition to repeated accounts of troop movements and concentrations in Moldavia and Poland, there are reports that german troops are moving from Northern Norway into Finland. This has been officiallyexplained as a movement of reliefs, but is probably part of the generalpreparations along the whole Soviet Western frontier.AIR SITUATION.General Review.28. Better weather on the Continent has enabled our bombers to attackBrest, Dortmund, dusseldorf and Duisburg. Attacks in daylight on enemycoastal shipping continue.Enemy day and night operations against this country have been on a small scale.Air attacks have been made on a number of objectives in Syria and aircraftco-operated with land and naval forces during the advance.Germany and Occupied Territory.General.29. Bomber Command flew 88 sorties by day and 428 by night. There was an improvement in the weather conditions during the week, and Bomber and coastal Command aircraft operated on four nights, as compared with one nightduring the previous week. The main concentration at night was on Brest, butthe period ended with a heavy attack on the Ruhr.Day.30. On the 5th June, a Blenheim of Bomber Command attacked a wireless station south of^ Songe- Fjord (Norway), and on the 11th June another bombed the docks at Ijniuiden, where storehouses on the quayside were hit and thewharves machine-gunned. On the same date three Coastal Command Beaufortsobtained direct hits on the Mole at Zeebrugge. Numerous attacks by day on enemy coastal shipping were carried out during the week by Bomber command aircraft, and are reported under Coastal Operations.31. Offensive operations were carried out by our fighters over North-EastFrance on three days during the period under review. Hurricanes penetratedat low altitude on the 9th June as far as Bethune and attacked a train south-west of St. Omer. On the 11th June, several offensive sweeps and patrols weremade in the morning over the Calais-Boulogne area, and in the afternoon astrong fighter escort, with covering forces, accompanied Blenheim bombers intheir successful attack on a 5,000 ton tanker between Ostend and Dunkirk. Inthese and other offensive operations three enemy fighters were probably destroyed and a further two damaged, against a loss of three of our own fi ghters.Night.32. On the night of 7th/8th June, the enemy cruisers in Brest were attacked,and 74 tons of bombs, including 24 bombs of the heavier types, were dropped inthe target areas. Sea fog and a smoke-screen from the promontory to the south-west, the breakwater and ships in the port entrance made it difficult to identify the cruisers, and no direct hits are claimed by the crews of the aircraft engaged.Bursts were, however, seen close to the aiming points and the docks were straddled.Many fires were started, one of which was very large.33. On the same night, aircraft of Coastal Command attacked the docks and shipping at Bergen. Fires were started in quayside warehouses and bombs fellnear the floating dock and submarine base. A 400-ton merchant vessel whichwas entering the port received a direct hit.
34. On the night of the 8th/&quot;9th, a reduced attack by Whitley bombers wasmade on the factory area of Dortmund. Industrial haze hampered observation,but many fires were started, one of which was visible from a distance of fifty miles.35. On the night of the 9th/10th, sea mines were laid off Brest by CoastalBeauforts and, on the following night, the naval vessels in the port were againattacked by Bomber Command, and 126 tons of bombs were dropped. On this occasion the weather was clear and, in spite of the smokescreen, our aircraft were able to bomb the positions of the ships fairly accurately, although no direct hits were claimed. A very large fire was started between the docks. While these operations were in progress, sea (nines were laid by Coastal Beauforts outsidethe port, and by Hampdens nearby in Quiberon Bay. Coastal aircraft also bombed the shipyard t St. Nazaire and the aerodromes at Mandal and Sola, in norway, and torpedoed a 2,000-ton tanker fourteen miles north-west of Obrestad.36. On the night the llth/12th June, 102 tons of high-explosive bombs were dropped on the industrial district of Dusseldorf, where a large oil fire was started to the west of the town, with further fires along a railway. Attacks of lesserintensity were made on Boulogne, Duisburg and Cologne, where many fires were started. At Duisburg, a very large warehouse in the inland port was set alight.At Boulogne, a warehouse in the docks was observed to be burning fiercely onehour after the fire had broken out. At Cologne, an experienced navigator describedone of the fires as the largest he had ever seen. Fifteen other targets in the Ruhrand the invasion ports were attacked the same night.37. From all the above night operations nine of our bombers failed to return.United Kingdom.38. Fighter Command flew 1,008 patrols, involving 2,382 sorties, by day,and 237 patrols, involving 351 sorties, by night. German offensive operations by day have again been on a small scale, and at night the total of long-range bombersplotted amounted only to 255, operational activity having been restricted bothby unfavourable weather and by a policy of conserving aircraft. The outstandingfeature of night bombing, however, was the large proportion of enemy aircraftdirected against shipping. Very few penetrations inland occurred during day-light, and weather conditions were unfavourable for interception, though somesuccesses were obtained.39. A feature of the week&apos;s activity was an attack by Me. 109&apos;s on a convoy off St.. Albans Head on the 9th June. German fighter aircraft have now been known to carry out the following activities : shipping attacks, ground strafing,bombing land targets, reconnaissance, defensive and &quot;intruder patrols&quot; andtransport work.40. At night, attacks on objectives inland were carried out on a very small scale in scattered districts from the Isle of Wight to Aberdeen. Only one enemybomber was shot down, and six others were damaged, two by anti-aircraft fire.Coastal Operations.41. Coastal Command flew 284 patrols and provided escorts for 93 convoys,involving 746 additional sorties. Shipping protection patrols carried out by fighter Command totalled 748 and involved 1,598 sorties. Aircraft of bomber and Coastal Commands continued to make vigorous attacks in daylight against enemy shipping along the enemy-occupied coastline..42. Bomber Command claim direct hits on four merchant vessels and asalvage ship, totalling 12,600 tons. Of these, an attack by Blenheims on a convoy off Ijmuiden on the 7th June was highly successful, and two merchant vessels of5,000 tons and 6,000 tons were left burning and in a sinking condition.Blenheims also sank a 200-ton trawler off Ijmuiden and left a 1,400-ton ship inflames off Gravelines during the period.43. Coastal Command aircraft made eight attacks on shipping and claimdirect hits on five vessels totalling 7,400 tons. Of this total, Blenheims obtainedseven direct hits on a 5,000-ton tanker off the coast between Ostend and Dunkirkand left it sinking and on fire amidships.   On the night the 6th/7th June, a
flying-boat attacked a 3,000-ton merchant vessel north of Vestfjord in Norwaywith inconclusive results, and another made a reconnaissance of KirkenesHarbour.44. Nine of our aircraft were lost during these operations and four enemy aircraft were destroyed, one probably destroyed and three damaged by our bombers. Of these, four Me. 109&apos;s became casualties in daylight combats withStirling bombers off the coast near Emden and Dunkirk.45.   Our mining operations in the Brest area are reported in paragraph 35.46. German bomber-reconnaissance aircraft from Norway and Franceoperated over our coastal districts and in the North-Western and South-V/esternApproaches. Activity north of Trondheim now includes fighter patrols by bothMe. 109&apos;s and Me. 110&apos;s. During weather flights carried out from this area inthe past week particular attention has been paid to the Jan Mayen Island area,north-east of Iceland. Attacks on shipping were made by day in Scottish watersby long-range bomber units from Norway, and on the 9th June attacks took placewest of the Faroes by He. lll&apos;s and, off Scarborough and St. Albans Head, byMe. 109 fighters.47. There has been a marked increase recently in German reconnaissance flights over South-East Eire. This may merely represent a resumption of activityafter the winter. On the other hand, it may be significant that special attention has been paid to the South-East corner (within a radius of 35 to 40 miles fromCarnsore Point). This part of the coast of Eire flanks one of the narrowest partsof St. George&apos;s Channel, and contains several sites which could be made suitablefor aerodromes and landing grounds.48. Enemy armed reconnaissances by night were made off the East Coast,North-East Scotland, the Straits of Dover and in South-Western waters andCardigan Bay. A convoy was attacked off Folkestone on the night of the6th June, and five aircraft were suspected of minelaying in the Thames Estuaryon the night of the 8th June, but enemy minelaying was on a very reduced scale.Gibraltar.49. On the 6th June it was claimed that during the preceding night italian aircraft had bombed Gibraltar. Subsequent investigation showed that, thoughbombs had been dropped, these fell not on Gibraltar but on the Spanish town ofEstepona, forty miles to the north-east. Early in the morning of the 6th June,a Savoia 82 landed at Son San Juan (Majorca), was refuelled and returned toItaly. The crew of this aircraft stated that they were returning from an attack against Gibraltar, and it therefore seems that the Spaniards were supplying fuelto an aircraft which had been bombing a Spanish town.Central Mediterranean.50. On the night 7th/8th June, seven Swordfish of the Fleet Air Arm,operating from Malta, laid mines in Tripoli Harbour; as a diversion a bombing attack was also carried out, as a result of which several large fires were started at the west end of the harbour. On the following night, Swordfish dropped flamefloats, as it was thought the harbour might be covered with inflammable oil as aresult of the sinking of the M.V. Barmania, but no fires resulted; bombs were also dropped and a merchant vessel was fired.Successful reconnaissances, over the Ionian Sea and off the Eastern TunisianCoast, were carried out by mary lands from Malta.51. The enemy carried out a series of small night raids on Malta andsome slight damage was caused to Luqa aerodrome; Takali and Hal Far were also attacked by day. On the night 5th/6th June, a He. Ill was held by searchlightsand probably destroyed by a Hurricane; on another night two B.R. 20&apos;s were shot down into the sea. Four Hurricanes intercepted four S. 79&apos;s fifty miles southof Malta, two of which they destroyed and badly damaged the others. AnotherS. 79, with an escort of Me. 109&apos;s, attempted a reconnaissance of the Island andwas also shot down into the sea.52. There are indications that the German air forces in Sicily have beendrastically reduced. The French have reinforced Tunisia by a small number ofmulti-seater fighters.
Egypt and Cyrenaica.53. Persistent night attacks on Benghazi were carried out by Wellingtonsfrom Egypt; many hits were observed on the Central and Cathedral Moles and large fires were reported, particularly between the telephone exchange and theGovernorate. A number of attacks were also made on Derna, where direct hits were scored on the barrack blocks, and several aircraft were believed to have been hit on the aerodrome. Blenheims bombed other landing grounds, includingGambut and Gazala, and also Capuzzo Fort.54. On the 9th, a very successful raid was carried out at daybreak by hurricanes, as a result of which fourteen aircraft were destroyed and others damaged on the ground at Gazala and Derna. On the 11th, Blenheim fighters destroyed three more aircraft at Berka.55. On the 10th June, Blenheim fighters armed with 20-mm. cannonsattacked about 100 large lorries towing trailers on the road between Barce andDerna, which were believed to be loaded with oil disembarked at Benghazi.Twenty-eight lorries were destroyed and others damaged. On the following dayfurther damage was inflicted on enemy M.T. and troops; in the Gazala-Capuzzo-El Aden region Hurricanes destroyed eighteen large vehicles, whilewest of Apollonia, Maryland aircraft destroyed seven more.56. There is no increase in the number of German aircraft in Libya. On the night 4th/5th June, twelve enemy aircraft attacked the docks at Alexandria;no hits were obtained in the target area, but fifteen houses were damaged and thirty-seven civilians killed. On the night of 7th/8th June, two waves of enemy aircraft made heavier attacks on the town and harbour, which caused many casualties and considerable damage to property. In consequence, the evacuation of a large percentage of the civilian population was undertaken and still continues.57. Hurricanes provided protective patrols for Naval Units and shippingbetween Tobruk and Alexandria. Tomahawks destroyed a Cant.Z.1007 overAlexandria and probably destroyed a Ju.88.Dodecanese.58. On four nights during the week, Wellingtons from Egypt bombed the aerodromes of Kattavia, Calato and Maritza on Rhodes; many fires and explosions were observed and some aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Rhodesharbour was also attacked and three hits were scored on the North Mole.Crete.59. Reconnaissances of Ag Gelena were carried out on three days in anattempt to locate a party of British troops reported to be hiding there. these were inconclusive, but a flying boat landed there, on the night of the 9th/10th.The aircraft was attacked by machine-gun fire when five hundred yards fromthe shore, and the attempt had to be abandoned.Palestine and Syria.60. Our aircraft have co-operated with land and naval forces in the advanceinto Syria, which began on the morning of the 8th June. Blenheims madedaylight attacks on the aerodromes at Aleppo, Damascus and Palmyra; hangars and buildings were hit and a number of aircraft destroyed on the ground. FiveTomahawks carried out a machine-gun attack at Rayak aerodrome and hit sixfighters, while Hurricanes probably destroyed a Morane at Estabel. SixBlenheims with fighter escort bombed aviation petrol stores at Beirut and starteda large fire.61. Gladiators patrolled over our forward troops and, on the 9th June, twoof them drove off four Glenn-Martins which were attacking our land forces southof Damascus, and forced them to jettison their bombs. Two other Glenn-Martinsattempted reconnaissances of Haifa and Jerusalem; the first was destroyed by anti-aircraft fire and the second crashed near Tiberias.
62. Fighters carried out shipping patrols over naval um!$*. During anattack made by enemy aircraft on our ships and escorting aircraft on the 9th.Hurricanes and Tomahawks of the Royal Australian Air Force destroyed threeFrench aircraft and probably destroyed another. Three Hurricanes were shot down, but one pilot is safe.68. On the following night, twenty enemy bombers, probably Ju. 88&apos;s andHe. HFs from Rhodes, attacked Haifa for a period of three and a half hours.The power station and oil works were slightly damaged and a tanker was set on fire in the harbour. In this operation two enemy aircraft were destroyed and a third probably destroyed.64.   Twenty-five Dewoitine 520 fighters have arrived from France.East Africa.65. Our aircraft have continued to support land operations in the Gimmaand Gondar areas of Abyssinia; enemy positions, troops and M.T. have beenfreely attacked.   Air support was also provided for the capture of Assab.West Africa.66. There has been no indication of the reinforcement of French WestAfrica, nor of any redistribution of units, which would lend colour to press reportsof the imminence of a large-scale French attack on Free French Territory. Onthe 3rd June, however, an extensive photographic reconnaissance of Bathurst(Gambia) was carried out by a single French Glenn-Martin, while, on the following day, another Glenn-Martin, operating from Conakry, was reported over Freetown(Sierra Leone) and the Waterloo and Hastings aerodromes.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.67. Only two incidents occurred, causing slight damage in country districtsnear South Shields and North allerton.By Night.68. On the first three nights of the week very minor bombing occurred,affecting Torry Point (Aberdeenshire), Brentford and Acton in London, andLoch Ewe (Ross and Cromarty). On the night of the 8th/9th June there was aslight increase in bombing. At Penzance several persons were killed and some slight damage done in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight and Essex. On the following night no incidents of importance occurred, but on the night of the 10th/11th Junea light attack was made on the Pembroke Dock and Nayland district of SouthWales. There was a considerably increased scale of bombing on the night of the11th/12th June. The areas chiefly affected were Lincolnshire, the eastern counties and the towns of Huddersfield, Dover, Hastings and Bristol. At someof these places parachute mines were dropped and casualties were heavy.Damage.Pembroke Dock, 10th/11th June.69. There were a number of small fires in the Dock vicinity. All fires wereextinguished by 0615 hours.Dover, 11th /&apos;12th June.Serious damage occurred at the Gas Works and a large area in East Kentwill have its supplies affected.Damage, otherwise, has occurred to private property, and on the night of the11th/ 12th June was widespread and in some places heavy.Casualties.70. Casualties for the week ending 0600 hours, the 11th June, are estimatedat 32 killed and 59 injured.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past weeks from Air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Berlin. The following account of the raids in March and April has beenreceived from well-placed sources : (i) On the 12th/13th March a factory in the Kaiserin Augusta Strasse andone near Treptow were damaged beyond repair, and two railway bridges, one near Schoneberg and the other near the WarschauerStrasse Station, were demolished.(ii) On the 23rd/24th March the district around the Wittenbergplatz andKurfurstendamm suffered severely. Considerable dislocation was caused by a number of delay-action bombs that fell. (This districtcontains many theatres, cinemas, shops and night clubs less expensivethan those in the Unter den Linden district.) Domestic propertysurrounding the Lietzensee, near the Charlottenburg Station, suffered from damage by fire.(iii) On the 9th/T0th April the major damage (as previously reported) wasin the Unter den Linden district. It is learnt, in addition, that partof the university roof was destroyed by fire and splinters causeddamage to the church and museum nearby. There were also fires inthe Frankfurter Strasse, East of the Alexanderplatz.(iv) On the 17th/18th April, in spite of very intense anti-aircraft fire, thecentre of the city was reached by some of the aircraft. Within aradius of 500 to 700 metres of the Kaiserdam most buildings had theirtiles blown off and windows and frames blown out. Fires were causedat the Gesundbrunnen end of the Swinemunderstrasse and in theMullerstrasse in the suburb of Tegel. It was apparent that a new type of bomb was being used as the area damaged by H.E. bombs was more extensive than in previous raids.Hamburg. Two reports speak of heavy damage having been done to Blohmand Voss. A direct hit on the machine shop held up work for three weeks. TheStulcken shipyards were also hit. In the raids on the 12th/13th and 13tih/14thMarch there were large fires near the Main Station in Alstadt and Neustadt.In the centre of the city, underground and trams were stopped.Hanover. Photographs taken on the 1st- June show the lengths to whichthe Germans are going in the camouflage of principal landmarks. The main railway station has imitation roads on its roof crossing at right angles whichare carried down by netting at the side. The artificial lake at the south end ofthe city is now nearly covered with wooden rafts painted to tone with thesurroundings. This lake was a most important landmark. The Mittelland Canalhas what is probably netting stretched over it and the railway lines to the north of the Continental Gummiwerke have had roads painted across them. the photographs are of too small a scale for an adequate assessment of the damage done in the attack of the 15th/16th May, but it is clear that a large two- or three-storey building in the Hackethal wire and cable works has been wrecked andindustrial premises in Hainholz have been gutted.Dusseldorf. The gasworks at Neuss are said to have been completely destroyed.
France.Brest. In the attack on the 3rd/4th May a bomb entered the side of the scharnhorst below the bridge and exploded in the interior of the ship. Thecamouflage netting protecting both ships was badly damaged by their own A.A.fire.   The Gneisenau was said to have a propeller shaft damaged.St. Nazaire.-In the attacks on the 4th/5th and 5th/6th May the submarineshelter and a torpedo boat were hit.Norway.Kristiansand. In the raid on the aerodrome on the 9th/10th May six air-craft were destroyed.
