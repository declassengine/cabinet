(41) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 10.Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1941.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENTSECRETNews and Censorship.1. THE issue of news and official communiques will continue to be canalisedthrough the Ministry of Information.The publication of war news from the fighting Departments, or from the civil departments injLeijixcjmecii^^ war, must, however, be subject in theevent of dispute to the veto of the Departmental Minister concerned. This vetois not to be exercised unreasonably, and a final decision must not be undulydelayed. The Departmental Ministers concerned must be readily accessible todetermine important issues of policy; and each must depute an official of thehighest standing to whom these matters may be referred direct and who is empowered to take a final decision if his Minister is not available.2. In general, the supply of news from the aforesaid Departments will bethe responsibility of the Department concerned.Subject to what is said in paragraphs 4 and 8 below as to direct contact between Departments and the Press, the use and exploitation of this news mustbe regarded as primarily the responsibility of the Ministry of Information. Itshould be a fixed rule, however, that operational communiques from the service departments or from the Commanders on the war fronts may not be altered,even in form, without the consent of the Departmental Minister concerned.3. The function of censorship, other than Departmental censorship, ispreserved to the Ministry of Information, who, armed with the general knowledgederived from their contact with the Departments and with the War Cabinet, willcorrect, prune or amplify the whole flood of news reaching them from everyquarter.Nothing must, however, prejudice the right of Departmental Ministers toveto or require the publication of any particular fact or statement.Publicity General.4. Departments which have Public Relations Branches and Press officers should be at liberty to preserve their existing contacts with the Press for thepurpose of dealing with enquiries about their day-to-day work.5. The Ministry of Information has, however, the creative function ofproviding a steady flow of facts and opinions calculated to further the policy ofthe Government in the prosecution of the war.A prime duty of the Minister of Information is to preserve intimate andcordial relations with the newspapers through their proprietors, editors andreporters, and to make the newspapers feel that the Ministry is their friend andthe pump and channel by which information is collected from the various departments.6. Accordingly, all organised propaganda on behalf of a Departmentcarried out through the medium of the Press, films, posters or radio should be conducted through the Ministry of Information. In particular, all paid-spaceadvertising should not only be placed but should be planned and carried throughat all stages by the Ministry of Information.7. In carrying out his task the Minister of Information has a right to theloyal assistance of every officer and civil Department concerned.All Ministers must therefore be held responsible for seeing that their public relations Officers collaborate fully and effectively with each other and with theMinistry of Information in the organisation and conduct of propaganda relatingto the prosecution of the war. In this work they should function, notindependently, but as members of a team under the Minister of Informationfurthering the purposes and policy of that Ministry. Nothing in this plan needprevent the use of a Departmental organisation for the execution of a particularproject (e.,g., the making of a film), where that is the most convenient course, but[22645]
2this must not derogate from the responsibility of the Ministry of Information over,the whole field of propaganda.. Instructional films, such as those prepared bythe War Office in connection with the training of troops, are on a different footingand should remain the responsibility of the Department.The Treasury should be asked to consider with the Departments concernedwhat rearrangement of personnel may be entailed by this new alignment of functions and responsibilities.8. Nothing in the above affects the issue of Departmental publications orthe issue of directions to the public, even in propaganda form, by theDepartments from which they emanate.B.B.C.9. The Ministry of Information will take full day-to-day editorial controlof the B.B.C. and will be responsible for both initiative and censorship. It willbe the duty of the Minister of Information to carry with him, so far as possible,the Board of Governors, who stand as umpires and sureties to Parliament forthe spirit in which the B.B.C. propaganda is conducted.Speeches.10. The Ministry of Information will also conduct, when necessary, speakingcampaigns in the country, but in this task they must carry with them the opinions of the various parties expressed through their Parliamentary Whips.11. Ministers who are members of the War Cabinet and those who regularlysit in with them, namely, the Service Ministers, the Home Secretary, the Secretaryof State for Dominions and the Colonial Secretary, as the Leader of the Houseof Lords, are free to make speeches expounding the policy of the War Cabinet.however, the making of speeches by many different Ministers in time of war isto be &quot;deprecated because of the danger of discrepancies occurring, which can beused to stultify the Administration. Ministers of Cabinet rank, in the pre-warsense, including the Service Ministers, should speak on their Departmental workwhen this is indispensable, but they would be well advised to consult the Ministerof Information on any passage about which they may have doubt, especially ifit lies outside their Departmental sphere, and they should always consult theForeign Office on any matter affecting our relations with foreign Powers,including, of course, any direct appeals to the public in foreign States. It is undesirable that, as a general practice, Ministers other than War cabinet ministers should deal with military topics. Should they desire to do so, they are requested to consult General Ismay, representing the Minister of Defence, on anyparticular points outside broad and common knowledge. Ministers not of Cabinetrank and Under-Secretaries ought not to discuss the general policy of the war,apart from exhortations to zeal and the happy re-statement of the acceptedcommonplaces, without reference to the Minister of Information.Subject to the above, it ought to be possible for many very good speechesto be made in the ordinary course, after reference to the Minister of Information,whose object must be the maintenance of public morale at its high level throughthe largest number of competent exponents.June 26, 1941.
