(41) 6.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND/lCEY.It is requested that special care may I^^taken toensure the secrecy of this document. .WAR CABINET.LORD HANKEY&apos;S COMMITTEE ON PREVENTING OIL from reaching ENEMY POWERS.WE submit herewith a report by Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;s Committee on theGerman Oil Position on the effect on Axis oil supplies of the opening of the sea route through the Dardanelles.It is requested that this report, with which we agree, be considered as a supplementary report to the Sixth Report of Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;s Committee(Enclosure to&quot; W.P. (41) 85). .   *On behalf of the Committee :(Signed) HANKEY, Chairman.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 10, 1941.Effect on Axis Oil Supplies of the Opening of the Sea route through the dardanelles.IT is calculated that owing to the blocking of the Danube and the interruption of rail transport through Yugoslavia, there should be a reductionof 350,000 to 450,000 tons in the estimates of supplies from Roumania to the axis, given in the Sixth Report of the Committee on the German Oil Position.Owing to the opening of the Eastern Mediterranean, transport f aclities are now available whereby this deficiency might be made up. Roumanian crude production at the end of May was running at the rate of about 5f million tons per annum,and it is considered very unlikely that this could be increased to more thanmillion tons per annum by September. On this basis, after allowing for a cut of about 50 per cent, in Roumanian consumption and sustained military activity in the Near East till the end of September, the available export surplus for the 8 months, April to September, will be some 300,000 tons below the estimate forAxis imports from Roumania in the Sixth Report. In order to achieve theestimated level of imports, it would, therefore, be necessary to draw on stocks tothe extent of about 300,000 tons, and to transport about 550,000 tons per month for the three months, July to September, i.e., 150,000 tons per month would haveto be transported by sea. Such a draft on stocks was, in fact, contemplated inthe German programme.2. The opening of sea transport will enable Germany, if she so desires, tolift the free balance of Roumanian stocks.   Total stocks were recently estimated[22605]
at 11 million tons, but of this amount at least \ million tons is permanently lockedup in refineries, pipe-lines and on the fields, and in addition it is necessary to&apos;allow a minimum distributional reserve for Roumania which may be estimatedat about 150,000 tons. This leaves about 850,000 tons, which is reduced to550,000 tons by the draft on stocks referred to above. If Germany decides to liftthese stocks and the amounts referred to at the end of paragraph 1 by sea,increased bunker consumption, amounting to at about 100,000 must be allowed for.3. So far as the statistical position is concerned, the effect of the opening of sea transport is to add -I million tons to the Free stocks of the Axis and thusmake the oil position more elastic, but the rate of current supplies is not improvedunless more is obtained from Russia.4. The opening of sea transport creates a favourable situation for Germanyto bring pressure to bear on Russia for increased oil deliveries. There is sufficient tonnage in the Mediterranean under Axis control to transport oil atthe rate of about 4 million tons a year from Black Sea Ports to the Adriatic, andif a part of the Russian tanker fleet was also utilised, this figure might beincreased to 4-^ million tons. It is considered that under threat of war russia might be willing to supply this amount which would involve forgoing the additions to stock which she is believed to have been making, and in -addition either a restriction on her own consumption or a draft on existing stocks.5. Although transport of Roumanian oil by sea would be of particularbenefit in relieving Italian and, possibly, French shortages and would greatlyrelieve the strain on Axis transport, Germany may not, in fact, wish to remove the whole of the Roumanian stock in view of the need for keeping a considerablereserve for further activities in the Near East or against Russia, and of the fearof important losses through the sinking of tankers. If Germany decides to moveby sea only sufficient Roumanian oil to maintain her programme of importsallowed -for in the 6th Report, she would theoretically be able to transport some225,000 tons of Russian oil per month over and above the imports from Russiaalready allowed for. If she decides to move the whole of the free Roumanianstocks this would occupy the whole tanker tonnage available for about two months.Effect on Conclusions.1. Over the six months, April to October, it is estimated that on accountof the blocking of the Danube, Axis consumption will exceed current supplies byabout 300,000 tons, unless Germany succeeds in obtaining increased supplies fromRussia. Free stocks at the end of the period will amount to about 2 million tonsinstead of the 1^ million tons in the report, owing to the fact that Roumanianstocks must now be regarded as freely available.2. The opening of sea transport reduces the period before improvementsets in to a few weeks instead of some months, and the rate of improvement maybe considerably increased if substantial supplies are obtained from Russia.3. The degree of destruction of German plants necessary to create a critical situation must be considerably greater than contemplated in the 6th Report unlessattacks on sea transport can be made on a scale sufficient to prevent the use ofthis route to any material extent. None the less, effective destruction of syntheticplants, refineries and inland communications must impair the industrial potentialavailable to Germany and might prejudice her military operations.4. If the full quantity which can be transported is obtained from Russia,the total supplies of oil available to the Axis will enable them to allow civil con-sumption throughout Europe at about 50 per cent, of normal, assuming no further increase in Axis service consumption. Without this increase in Russian supplies the net effect of opening of sea transport is to increase the free stocks by\ million tons and so make the oil situation somewhat more elastic.5. If Germany obtains control of Iraq oilfields she would not be able toobtain any immediate return unless she found pipe-lines, pumping stations andwells intact. The importance of ensuring the destruction of these in the event of withdrawl is obvious.
