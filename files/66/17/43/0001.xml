E. BEIDGES.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 18, 1941.Telegram dated 2nd Jidy, 1941, from the G.O.C., East Africa, to the War Office.The following is an account of the activities of the East and West african troops who took part in the East African campaign, 1940/41.The ascendance of the morale of the East African force over the Italianswas first obtained in the raid on El Wak in December, 1940, in which gold coast troops took a prominent part. The patrol activity which continued fromthen on until the advance on Afmadu proved that both East and West african troops were vastly superior to the Italian Banda who were screening the enemy&apos;sadvanced positions.During the advance to the Juba in February, 1941, and thence toMogadiscio and later in March to Harar, troops were conveyed in M.T. butthey showed that they were well able to march and fight after lengthy journej/sunder appalling conditions of road. The speed of advance of the 22nd east african Brigade on Afmadu probably caused the Italians to evacuate Kismayuwithout fighting.At Bulo Erillo, 24th Gold Coast Brigade captured a wired and entrenchedposition after severe fighting. Nearly all white personnel were killed or woundedbut the African troops pressed home the attack with unabated vigour andcourage.In the capture of Jelib, East African troops showed great endurance intheir march across country, cutting a road through virgin bush for the wholemotorized column in order to block the enemy&apos;s retreat 18 miles east of Jelib.During the advance of 23rd Nigerian Brigade in March from Mogadiscio toHarar, the troops covered 1,054 miles in 30 days, i.e., an average of 35 miles aday. Two companies 2nd Nigeria Regiment, supported by only a few armoured cars, at one period encountered and drove off an enemy rear-guard atDagahabur with the remainder of their battalion 100 miles in the rear.The situation at the Marda Pass in March required new tactics as thecountry was unsuitable for A,F.Vs. Troops of the 23rd Nigerian Brigadecaptured the heights overlooking the enemy&apos;s position and forced him towithdraw.Thereafter, Nigerian troops, unaccustomed to cold and damp fought fromhot and dusty bush to wet and cold highlands, yet maintained cheerfulnessand courage in spite of strange conditions and strenuous climbing.When extensive demolitions were encountered on the road to Diredawa,&quot;** &apos; J,fc)v-&apos;-i- -AC*&apos;J-A   LJ.v^wj-/o   vvui nvy^i  ^vij. lxxx \^iv/ uioo. cijou l  inv  ^ii^xiivvio   Lv  V^JLV^-CXI    ULJLt   V_LCli.JU.cigC[22733]
During the Battle of the Lakes and the Omo River in May and June, west and East African troops had to operate on bad roads in high country withalmost daily torrential rains. Their fighting qualities never deteriorated nor did their &quot;spirit relax under those adverse conditions.At Bubissa, 5th K.A.R. of the 22nd East African Brigade were counter-attacked by a force of several Italian medium tanks. There was no questionof panic. The troops allowed the tanks to pass through and themselves with-clrew with their prisoners.Later in June at Goluto, 2nd Nigeria Regiment, who were attached to22nd Brigade, repulsed a further tank counter-attack by medium tanks and captured 800 prisoners. During the action, a British N.C.O. climbed on to an italian tank, opened the turret top and killed the crew.The crossing of the Omo was a difficult task as the river was swollen byrains and the majority of the East African troops are not accustomed tomanaging craft on large rivers. Nevertheless, three platoons of 5th K.A.R.crossed the river and held a precarious bridge-head in the face of the enemyposition unsupported for three days. Meanwhile, a platoon of 1/3 K.A.R.(machine gun battalion) manhandled their machine guns up a precipitousslope and engaged the enemy across the river, firing on and silencing their105 mm. guns. 1/1 K.A.R., after crossing the fast-flowing river,, gained theheights on the enemy&apos;s flanks and forced him to withdraw. 24th Gold CoastBrigade&apos;s advance from Neghelli to Dalle in May encountered a strong enemyposition at Uaddara, where the Abyssinians had held the Italians up for thebest part of a year in 1935 / 36. The country here consists of dense forestand all features strongly held by the enemy in depth. All movements werehampered by torrential rains. 2nd Gold Coast Regiment made a wide encirclingmarch carrying two day&apos;s rations through thick undergrowth, and&apos; came in onthe enemy&apos;s left rear, causing him to withdraw. The advance from here to Dallewas along a road where only limited M.T. could move and the troops were forced to march on foot a distance of over 100 miles.On the 21st East African Brigade&apos;s front, the 1/4 K.A.R. carried out amost successful action in May at Sorroppa in which the enemy were againout-fought and out-manoeuvred, 387 prisoners and 4 guns being captured.After a further action at Bagamo, south of Alghe, the enemy were pursuedover a difficult road to Giabassire, where they took up a strong position, butevacuated it before our attack developed. The 1/2 K.A.R. marched the 40miles from Giabassire to Dilla and were maintained by improvised packtransport.25th East African Brigade, during the whole campaign, has been in theTurkana area, with the role of containing the Merilde tribesmen, who werearmed by the Italians. The brigade carried out a lengthy advance in may to occupy Maji, and has been subjected to considerable hardships, including a severe shortage of water.Throughout the campaign, the East and West African light batteries gavevaluable support to their brigades. The West African batteries had only justchanged over from head-porte to mechanized-porte transport, but adaptedthemselves readily to this new form of transportation.51st Gold Coast Battery has throughout given efficient close support,especially- at Bulo Erilla and Uaddara.At the Omo River, 52nd Nigerian Battery effectively broke up a determinedcounter-attack by quick shooting.53rd East African Battery, which was refitted after its losses in british somali land, had fewer engagements, but their accurate shooting at Sorroppawas a great contributing cause to the success of the battle.The East and West African field companies, though less fully equippedthan, the South African field companies, played their part in. surmounting theinnumerable obstacles met both in road and bridge demolitions.Field ambulances dealt effectively with, all casualties.Credit is due for all first and second line drivers of transport units, whohad to do long hours of driving over appalling roads in conditions varying from suffocating dust to blinding rain.To summarize, both. East and West African troops, although operating in strange climates and&apos; at high altitudes have shown great endurance.Subjected to shelling and A.F.V&quot;. attacks, they-have shown determination against an enemy who sometimes had a large proportion of European troops. Underall conditions they have maintained their spirits and cheerfulness in the face of hardships.
