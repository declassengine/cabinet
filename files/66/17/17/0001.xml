Following is short summary of operations todate and plans for future,,2a Vichy French expected to be attacked in overwhelming&apos;force both on ground and in air and were probably preparedto capitulate after token resistance,,    On discovering ourweakness and that we had no tanks they put a very stout andskilful resistance0    Fighting has been heavy and casulties on both sides severe030 At first we made steady progress and. reached Kiswe,Quneitra, Merjayouri., Jezzin and on coast road crossed LitaniRiver after stiff fightc    Vichy French then used their armoured fighting vehicles boll&apos;1 in counter-attack behind our forwardtroops0    They captured Ezra temporarily and threatened to cutDera Road;, they surprised and overran H0Qe    and two companiesIste Royal Fusiliers at Quneitra and they recapturedMeriayound where the responsible commander had taken practicallyhis whole force into the hills in wide turning movement againstHasbeya and. left main road uncovered,.    On coast road tank&quot;counter-attack was repulsed after temporary success and wecaptured Sidon040 Fighting in front of Damascus was exceptionally heavy0Vichy French had very strong position at Kiswe which was captured by 5 Indian Brigade and Free French after hard struggleboth brigades were exhausted and majority of Free French were on point of refusing to fight their own countrymen any more^v .By supreme effort of 5 Indian Brigade against Mezze Free french were induced, to advance against Kadera,.    After more heavy fighting Vichy French evacuated city,.    Effort of 5 IndianBrigade was magnificent but it is reduced to skeleton with onecommanding officer killed and two missing,..    There is probably   .not much more fight left in Free French who have lost manyofficers.    Legentiihomme carried on with broken arm he is .stout hearted commander but either over-optirnistic orpessimistic by turnsc50 At Merjayoun we are making slow progress by limitedattacks at Jezzin and on coast Australians are reorganisingfor further advance,,    All this country is difficult andfavours rearguard action and Vichy French are fightingskilfully and with determination.,.60 Present plan is to maintain pressure on broad front T,hds*.Brigade group from Iraq will move from Abu Kenial on Deir Ez Zovabout end of month thence on Aleppo when supply situationpermits^    Habforce is meeting resistance from strong defence at Palmyra after overcoming or bypassing these it will move on Horns.    Free French will secure road Damascus-Nebek-Homso

16 Brigade is moving from Qatana on Rayak endeavouring to cut roads to Mer jayoun and Jezzin.    Australian Divisionafter clearing up Merjayoun and Jezzin will move on Beirut.23 Xnf* Brigade group and Medium Battery ar-e on way np to reinforce, &apos;By all accounts &quot;Vichy French are getting .tired and      -xreduced in numbers.   Probably half of their sixty tankshave been put out of, action, we have about 2,000 prisoners and nearly all -battalions have been heavily engaged, and suffered severe losses,,   Unless -they can obtain reinforcementstheir resistance must collapse sooner or later6
