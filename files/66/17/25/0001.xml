TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.LONDON DEFENCE EXERCISE.Report by the Home Defence Committee.AT their meeting on the 23rd June, 1941,* the War Cabinet invited theHome Defence Committee to work out with Departments concerned the detailedimplications and arrangements on the civil side which the proposed Londoninvasion exercise would entail.2. We have held three meetings and have consulted with the following departments : Treasury.Home Office.Ministry of Supply.Ministry of Labour and NationalService.Board of Trade.Board of Education.Ministry of Health.Ministry    of    Agriculture     andFisheries.Ministry of Aircraft Production.Ministry of Food.Ministry of Information.Ministry of Pensions.General Post Office.Customs and Excise Department.Mines Department.Petroleum Department.Stationery Office.Inland Revenue.Assistance Board.Commissioner of Police for the city of London.Commissioner  of   Police   for   the metropolis.Regional Commissioner for London.3. Among the most important of the problems arising were those relatingto maintenance of supply and production, compensation, the effect on contracts and the administration of justice. We set up special sub-committees to deal withthese questions. Their reports will be found at Annexes I, II and III, but their main recommendations, with which we agree, are summarised below : Supply and Production.Admiralty. Delay would be general, and 25 per cent, of Admiralty&quot; bottle-neck &quot; firms would be affected. On the whole, however, loss of output would not be worse than that caused by a bad air raid, but special arrange-ments might be necessary to enable two specially important firms to maintainproduction.[22685]* W.M. (41), 62nd Conclusions.b
Ministry of Supply. Loss of output is estimated at approximately45 per cent, of one day&apos;s work and would have repercussions on the outputof the whole country to the extent of about 10 per cent, of one day&apos;s work.If, owing to congestion, the delay in the arrival of raw materials extendedover 24 hours (as seems possible), this loss would increase considerably.Ministry of Aircraft Production. 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, of keyfirms would be affected, but over all the loss of output would be not more than10 per cent, of a full day&apos;s output of the whole country.The sub-committee&apos;s general conclusion is that the total loss of produc-tion on the day of the exercise would be of the order of 10 per cent, of awhole day&apos;s normal output, but the Ministry of Labour are of opinion thatthis may be an under-estimate.Effect on Contracts and the Administration of Justice.Contracts. It is impossible to foresee or provide against theinnumerable delays, inconveniences and failures which will ensue. Similardelays resulting in breaches of contract must have arisen as a result of air raids, but as for the most part the parties affected succeed in composing their differences without recourse to the Courts, the sub-committee is of opinionthat they may be left to this course in the present case.A dministration of Justice. While it would be an advantage to suspend the sittings of Courts on the clay of the exercise, if it is decided as a matterof policy that everyone on the day should pursue his ordinary engagementseven at the risk of inconvenience and failure, no special action is needed asregards the Courts.As a matter of general policy we recommend that the latter course shouldbe adopted.Compensation. The sub-committee came to the conclusion that whileit would be reasonable for the Army Authorities to entertain claims for physical damage or for total loss directly caused by their operations (e.g.,the condemnation by a medical officer of health of a lorry load of vegetableskept waiting for a long time at a barrier) it would be inconsistent withgeneral Government policy, would be a very dangerous and expensiveprecedent and would, in fact, be impracticable to admit any further claim for consequential damage. As regards loss of working time the positionseems to be sufficiently covered by the practice as to interference from air raids arrived at by industrial agreements.4. We considered how far special provisions would be necessary for thecontinuance of services necessary to the life of the community and to the prosecu-tion of the war. The Air Staff urged that there should be no curtailment of theAir Force operational communication system having regard to the necessity forthe maintenance of this in connection with present operations. We were assured by the G.P.O. and Home Forces that suitable steps could be taken to avoid inter-ferenue with these Air Ministry operational circuits. No other case of comparableimportance was brought to our notice in which special arrangements would benecessary, but a number of instances was reported to us in which the restriction of road traffic would result in the temporary suspension or curtailment ofimportant civilian services. Special mention may be made of the more important of these : (a) There would be a very considerable restriction on public telecommunications-tions services, but this should not be worse than that resultingfrom a serious air raid. As regards postal services, the conditions imposed by the exercise will render it impossible for the Post Officeto guarantee an effective delivery of mails in London on the day ofthe exercise, and will result in serious dislocation of the deliveryarrangements on the following day.(&amp;) The movements of doctors would be considerably restricted, but theMinistry of Health are satisfied! that in general essential visits can be performed on foot. The movement of ambulances would not beimpeded.(c) The distribution of morning newspapers and the production of eveningnewspapers would be seriously affected, but the spread of rumoursmight be checked by announcements as soon as it was safe to issuethem.
(d) A memorandum has been prepared jointly by the Ministry of Agricultureand Ministry of Food on the probable reactions of the exercise oh.food distribution and the probable loss by deterioration, and this willbe found at Annex IV. The main conclusions are that some loss ofperishable foodstuffs must be accepted as inevitable. Distribution of bread, meat, milk and fish would be delayed or rendered impracticablein certain areas. So far as milk is concerned, it must be anticipatedthat many people, including hospital inmates, infants and nursing mothers, will miss their supply for the day.We are of opinion that, so far as hospitals are concerned, theproblem can be eased to some extent without affecting the realism ofthe exercise by the provision of special milk vans.(e) Normal working of Government Departments could not be expected.There would inevitably be a reduced staff, and &quot;important members would in many cases be taking part in the exercise. Ministers mightnot be able to depend on service of the ordinary standard. special arrangements would have to be made to ensure the attendance of essential operational staffs.(/) Arrangements wTould be necessary to prevent congestion of incominggoods traffic by rail and road.(g) The hold up of road transport might delay the turn round of ships. Wehave tried to estimate the extent of this drawback. In the case of meat, which was specially mentioned to us, a hold up of road meattransport vans on the day of the exercise might cause a correspondingdelay for one day at most in the discharge of one meat vessel to theextent of perhaps 500 tons. On the basis of this example we do not regard the point        material one.No doubt a number of other difficulties will arise, many of which cannot before seen. For example, funerals could not take place in certain areas on the dayof the exercise. But the more unforeseen difficulties likely to arise the greaterseems the need for the exercise.5. We are of opinion that the preparation and co-ordination of detailed plans to deal with the situation which would arise in the event of an attack on london designed, to paralyse the machinery of Government should be undertaken by a standing operational committee, which might be associated with LondonRegional Headquarters and on which the Departments concerned with civiloperations should be represented.6. We had before us an announcement of instructions and advice to theinhabitants of London which had been prepared for issue by press and broadcast on imminent threat of invasion. We are of opinion that this statement shouldbe issued at an early date and that a special announcement relating solely to theexercise should be issued to the press (but not by the B.B.C. for security reasons)shortly before the selected day. It would not, of course, give any indication ofthe time of the exercise, but a preliminary &quot; stand-to &quot; warning message issuedjust before the exercise by Home Forces would enable Departments to takeprecautionary measures for the continuance of their services. The issue of thefirst statement now would have the incidental advantage of serving as a follow-upto the &quot; Beating the Invader &quot; pamphlet which was issued recently.7. One of the most valuable features of the exercise will be the opportunityit will afford to drive home its lessons to the general public. It is important that as full publicity should be given to it as is compatible with security require-ments. We recommend that all possible facilities should be given to the press,and that, if necessary, special censorship arrangements should be made to enablereports and articles to be examined without delay. A special Committeeassociated with the Ministry of Information on which the press might be repre-sented should be set up to co-ordinate arrangements for publicity and censorship.In so&quot; far &quot;as Departments expressed any preference as regards the day onwhich the exercise should be held the consensus of opinion was that Tuesday wouldbe the most suitable day of the week.   The Ministry of War Transport would prefer some day towards the end of the week so that the week-end might be[22685] B 2
available for &quot;clearing up.&quot; But if adequate arrangements can be made inadvance as in paragraph 4 (/) above for avoiding goods congestion at Londonterminals, the problem of clearing up should be materially eased.9.   The following is a summary of our conclusions :  (1) That no insuperable difficulty would occur so far as civil administration is concerned in carrying out the exercise and that adequate arrange-ments could be made to ensure the maintenance of vital services.(2) That the overall loss of production essential to the war effort on the dayof the exercise would be of the order of 10 per cent, of a normal day&apos;output for the whole country, but that in view of the valuable lessonsto be learned this loss should be accepted.(3) That if the proposal to hold an exercise is approved : (a) The day chosen should be a Tuesday.(b) A general announcement of the plans to meet an attack on london, so far as they concern the civil population, should bemade at an early date. This should be followed up by publicityon specific points and a further announcement specificallyrelating to the exercise should appear in the press, but not be broadcast, shortly before the chosen date. The notice shouldnot give any indication of the date. If the exercise proves the valuable test we anticipate it should be followed up by furtherpublicity on its lessons.(c) A  standing  operational  committee  associated  with  LondonRegional Headquarters should be set up to co-ordinate measures for dealing with the situation created by a serious threat aimed at the machine of Government and therefore at central London.The application of its work to the exercise would form a usefultest of the measures proposed.(d) All possible facilities compatible with considerations of securityshould be given to the press to report the exercise. The arrange-ments to be made to achieve this should be referred to a specialCommittee associated with the Ministry of Information, onwhich the press might be represented.(Signed on behalf of the Committee) :S. F. STEWART, Chairman.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 5, 1941.
ANNEX I.Minutes of Sub-Committee on Supply and Production in connection with theLondon Exercise held in Room 294, Shell Mex Bouse, at 10-30 a.m. on june 30, 1941.Present:Lieutenant-General Sir Wilfrid Lindsell [Chairman).Mr. R. H. Hill, Ministry of War Transport.Mr. G. F. Stedman, Ministry of War Transport.Mr. A. S. Lemaitre, Admiralty.Mr. R. Lloyd Roberts, Ministry of Labour.Mr. R. C. G. Somervell, Board of Trade.Mr. W. Strath, Ministry of Aircraft Production.Mr. A. B. Valentine, Ministry of Supply.Engineer Rear-AdmiraLO. W. Skinner, Ministry of Supply.The Chairman commenced by explaining the purpose of the meeting, whichwas to inform the War Cabinet Sub-Committee of the actual effects on supplyand production arising out of the proposed London Exercise. The latter couldnot be held without considerable dislocation of the daily life of the community,and the report of .the Sub-Committee was required to assist the Cabinet in deciding whether the Exercise should be held or not.He emphasized the necessity of absolute reality if the Exercise was to beof any value, and that no action could be applied in advance which was notapplicable to preparations for actual attempted invasion. In this way it was hoped that valuable lessons regarding the latter might be learnt. It was important not to get an exaggerated view of possible dislocation to normal life.Business as usual should be the aim subject to non-interference with essentialmilitary action to defeat the enemy.The Chairman then called on representatives for their views in so far as their respective departments were affected.The Admiralty representative stated that, as far as ports and docks were concerned, the effect would be no worse than that of a bad blitz. He pointed out,however, that in certain special and important items London was one of the worstbottle-necks f rom the Admiralty production point of view, and that about 25 percent, of Admiralty bottle-neck firms would be affected, including two especially important firms in which production would be held up for at least a day. He-thought whilst delay would be general, loss of output on the whole would be small,probably not worse than after a bad air-raid.He mentioned one firm in particular engaged on specially important work,which he considered should take action on the &quot; stand to &quot; being given. Atthis point Mr. Valentine explained the procedure regarding the circulation ofthe &quot;stand to&quot; and &quot;action stations&quot; messages so far as the Ministry ofSupply was concerned. This procedure, which appeared to tally with that inforce in the other departments represented, did not include circulation to firms.The Committee considered that it was desirable that certain firms connected withvital industries should receive these messages and take appropriate &quot; stand to &quot;action, but after discussion it was decided that detailed recommendations in thisconnection were outside the scope of the terms of reference of the Committee.The Board of Trade representative stated that, while there would be no immediate effect on Board of Trade activities, certain congestion and dislocationwould result. \Rear-Admiral Skinner, Regional representative, Ministry of Supply, statedthat 25 per cent, of the country&apos;s engineering industry engaged on Ministry ofSupply work was located in the London area. In his opinion the stoppage of road transport in London would result in 75 per cent, of the workers arriving, lateat their factories with a consequent loss of output of approximately 45 percent,for the day of the Exercise. The London loss of output would have repercussions on the output of the whole country amounting to a 10 per cent, of a whole day&apos;production . If, due to congestion, the delay in arrival of raw material extendedover 24 hours, the loss of output would increase considerably.A
The Ministry of Aircraft Production representative quoted figures showing that in the three Supply Ministries over 500 key firms (15 to 20 per cent.) wouldbe affected; 130 out of&apos;290 instrument firms working for all three Services arealso concentrated in the London area. He estimated that the loss of output wouldbe not more than 10 per cent, of a full day&apos;s output of the whole country.The Ministry of Labour&apos;s representative expressed the view that the reaction of the workers and the consequent effect on production would depend to a verygreat extent on the terms of the warning Press announcement. The implicationof that announcement should definitely be that everybody would get to work,even though late and at some inconvenience. It would be realised, however, thatthe absence of individuals, even though the majority might be present, mightinterfere substantially with production in certain factories and, in any case, thefact that the Exercise was proceeding would naturally create a slack andexcitable atmosphere in the shops. For this reason he believed that the loss ofproduction for the day would be more than was anticipated by the supply departments.Mr. Lloyd Roberts also stressed the importance of excluding from the warning announcement any reference to a possible &quot; make-up &quot; of wages to covertime lost.The Committee note that the existing advice to the public as regards their actions in the event of hostilities is to the effect that &quot; if when you hear the warning you are at home you should remain at home.&quot; In the case of theLondon Exercise it is desired to ensure that the workers shall make all possibleefforts to reach the factories, which conflicts with the general instructions to thepublic for invasion conditions. It is suggested that this point should receiveattention in the published instructions preliminary to the Exercise.The Ministry of War Transport representative (Mr. Stedman) (subsequentlyagreed by Mr. R. H. Hill) stated that as all road transport was going to ceasein theLondon area it was practically impossible to give any real estimate ofeffect. As regards passenger traffic in London, a fair number of people should arrive by rail or by walking, but it would help to relieve congestion if a distinc-tion could be made between essential and non-essential workers, as the Exercisewill cover the peak hour, when facilities are strained to their utmost and cannotbe increased. The lack of road transport might impede the movement of HomeGuards to their duty stations. As far as goods traffic by road is concerned, therewill probably be considerable repercussions for at least 48 hours. This congestionis likely to spread far afield and might affect shipping clearances at ports. This,with the resulting congestion on the railways, due to non-clearance of Londondepots and late arrival of goods for despatch, would take some considerable timeto clear, and its effect would probably be felt for a week.There would be a considerable loss of perishable goods both on road and rail.He also asked whether it would not be possible to arrange for the convoyingof lorries arriving at dawn on the outskirts of London and diverting them by special routes or, failing that, parking them to relieve the roads for the military.He asked that if possible the Exercise could be arranged to take place at theend of a week, preferably Thursday, which was the best day from the point ofview of his Ministry. Tuesday was generally the worst day from a transportpoint of view.To sum up our enquiry, the majority of the Committee assess the total loss of production as the result of the Exercise as likely to be in the region of10 per cent, of a whole day&apos;s normal output; the Ministry of Labour, however,fear it might be more.It is considered that the congestion likely to be caused on the railways may take anything up to a week to clear, and they call particular attention to thenecessity for action in advance to deal with the accumulation of road transport-likely to arise on all approaches to London, including perishable meat, fish, milk and vegetable traffic, normally moving by night and reaching the London area in the early hours of the morning.The Committee feel that, the overriding factor of transport control being to keep movement in progress to avoid congestion, road transport movement shouldbe resumed in the London area at the earliest possible moment. Congestion, oncecreated, is likely to be more dangerous than the temporary loss of man hours inthe factories, and more far reaching in its effect.
In general, they consider that action by Departments to mitigate the effects of the Exercise should be strictly confined to the steps which they would normallytake on receipt of the &quot; stand to &quot; message. The Exercise should enable Depart-ments to review these steps in the light of its results, and no general review need be attempted in advance of the Exercise. It may, however, be desirable to allow7each Department to make such special arrangements as it thinks fit in oneor two very exceptional cases, such as those mentioned by the Admiraltyrepresentative.(Signed) W. G. LLNDSELL,Lieutenant-General.July 2, 1941.ANNEX II.Defence Exercise.Compensation Sub-Committee.1. The Government policy with regard to compensation for losses arisingout of enemy action, or action taken under the Defence Regulations, has been deliberately to exclude any compensation in respect of loss of income or livelihood.Under the Business Insurance Scheme the Board of Trade exclude consequentiallosses.2. The Army are frequently holding defence exercises in various parts ofthe country. The only points in which this particular exercise differs from others are that: -(a) it brings in the civil defence organisation;(b) it will take place in a densely populated, commercial, residential andindustrial area;(c) it will not be practicable to give precise notice in advance.These differences do not justify departing from the ordinary basis on whichthe Army pay compensation, viz., that they will admit claims in respect of physicaldamage caused by their operations but not in respect of consequential loss or lossof wages.   They do not pay compensation in respect of faits de guerre.3. As regards loss of working time, the position seems to be sufficientlycovered by the practice as to interference from air raids arrived at by industrialagreements. The principle is that men are paid if available for work, but not otherwise. Men who attend at their place of work are paid from the time ofattendance.  Those who do not attend are not paid.4. It is difficult, or impossible, to find any line on which to stand if theseestablished principles are departed from. Losses of a very varied kind may arise, for example : Consignments of perishable food may deteriorate or go bad.Retailers will lose their profits on goods delayed or not delivered.Newspapers will lose profits on sales and may have to make refunds toadvertisers.There may be demurrage charges on trucks held up.   (This may extendfar afield, e.g., to Liverpool, and over many days.)Business houses may lose business through telephone interruption.Many of the losses will occur after the close of the Exercise.(The question of losses arising out of non-fulfilment of contract is for lord Schuster&apos;s Committee.)5. The Sub-Committee came to the conclusion that, while it would be reasonable for the Army authorities to entertain claims for physical damage orfor total loss directly caused by their operations (e.g., the condemnation by a
ANNEX III.London Defence Exercise.Report on Legal Questions.We were requested to consider and report on the legal questions which will arise if the Exercise is carried out. We have been in some doubt whether theexpression &quot;legal questions&quot; is intended to refer to the arrangements inconnection with the administration of justice, or, on the other hand, to the effecton the rights of parties which may be produced by the dislocation consequent upon the scheme.   We thought it best to deal shortly with each of these matters.Justice is administered within the area affected both in civil and criminalcourts.&apos; The civil courts concerned are the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strandand those in the adjacent Bankruptcy Buildings as well as the County Courtswhich are scattered over the whole area.Criminal justice is administered at the Central Criminal Court, at theLondon Sessions House at Newington, and at thirteen metropolitan police courts,as well as in a few courts which sit at intervals for the hearing of cases in whichchildren are concerned, and benches of lay magistrates who sit at intervals toexercise certain quasi criminal functions -in particular the hearing ofsummonses against defaulting ratepayers.A. Civil Justice.On any ordinary day of the working week except Saturday, during theperiod of the year which is not covered by one of the Vacations, many hundreds of persons attend at the Royal Courts of Justice, as judges, other legal officials and clerks attached to the courts, counsel and solicitors and their respectiveclerks; parties and witnesses. The majority of counsel, solicitors and their clerkscarry on their business in an area which is, for the most part, not very far distantfrom the courts themselves, though probably most of them reside elsewhere inLondon or on the extremities of or outside the affected area. Judges, officials and the clerks attached to the courts probably come from some distance, andwould not enter the central part of the affected area unless the court were sitting.It is impossible to form any estimate of the number who, on any ordinary clay,would be in attendance at the courts. Many of them attend for the purpose of earning their living; but the great majority come because they are obliged todo so.  Many of them are compelled to come by legal process.August and September and the first twelve days of October, as well as afew days round Christmas, Easter week and Whitsun week, are Vacations, and,therefore, if a day in August is chosen for the Exercise, and an attempt is madeto carry on business in spite of the dislocation consequent upon the Exercise, afair test will not be given of what would happen if the Exercise took place inthe latter half of October or any other month of the year. Speaking generally,the work of the courts is almost at a standstill during Vacation periods, thoughspecial arrangements have been made this year for special sittings from the18th August to the 3rd October for certain specified classes of cases. (It is not known at present whether any advantage will be taken of these special arrangements.) If the Exercise, or the invasion for which it is a rehearsal, wereto take place in term time as distinct from Vacation, and no special arrangements are made beforehand to stop the work of the courts, a very great number of personswill be obliged to travel some from outside the area and many from distantplaces within the area in an endeavour to reach the courts and there to dischargemedical officer of health of a lorry load of vegetables kept waiting for a long time at a barrier), it would be inconsistent with general Government policy, would bea very dangerous and expensive precedent and would, in fact, be impracticable to admit any further claim for consequential damage.
their business. It may be expected that many of these persons will not succeed in reaching the courts, and that their absence will prove a great hindrance tothe discharge of business at the courts.In August the County Courts also will be in Vacation. If the Exercisewere to take place when the courts were in full session, the same consequences would ensue as are described above in dealing with the Royal Courts of Justice.It would be easy under powers now possessed to make orders suspending the sitting of the courts (both the Royal Courts of Justice and the County Courts)on the day chosen for the Exercise, and to inform the public that upon thesounding of the sirens those suspensory arrangements would come into effect.In that event provision would be made that notices, &amp;c, which, but for the suspension, would have taken effect on the day of the Exercise, would have effect for the following day. The question whether there should be such a suspensionis purely one of policy. We do not feel called upon to express any opinionwhether it is desirable. It is perhaps, however, right to point out that, althoughthe administration of justice plays in the truest sense a very high part in the life of the nation, it does not contribute to the national war effort, and that the suspension of the work of the courts for one day, or even for a prolonged period,would not in any way affect that effort.B. The Criminal Courts.The work of the Central Criminal Court, while it is in session, attracts avery large concourse of people judges, counsel, solicitors, their clerks, officials of the courts, witnesses, prisoners and police. It is extremely difficult to see how the work of the Central Criminal Courts could be carried on in the face of sucha dislocation as would be produced by the Exercise. Prisoners on trial at theCentral Criminal Court have to be conveyed there in prison vans from Brixtonor Ffolloway Prison, or other prisons outside the area affected. It is extremelydifficult to see how these prison vans can reach the court, and the trial cannotproceed in the absence of the prisoner. Jurymen and women, who are stillrequired for criminal trials though not for civil trials, come from all over thearea affected, and it is to be expected that many of them will be unable, byreason of the interference of the traffic, to reach the court at all, or, even if they reach it, to do so at the proper time. No harm would result to the administrationof justice if a criminal trial which is to be heard on any one particular day atthe Central Criminal Court were postponed to the next clay.The same observations apply to the work of the London Sessions atNewington.Here again it is a question of policy for the decision of persons other than ourselves whether it is best to suspend the work of these courts for the day ofthe Exercise. It may be observed, however, that it is extremely unlikely that either the Central Criminal Court or the London Sessions will be sitting on anyday in the middle of August.The metropolitan police courts present a somewhat different problem. Theysit daily. Each is presided over by a single magistrate assisted by a clerk. Forthe most part the persons charged before them come from no great distance. Ifthey are in custody, they are probably in the cells connected with the court; ifthey are on remand, they will have to be brought by prison van from Brixton orHolloway; and prisoners on bail may reside anywhere within or without theaffected area. The sittings of these courts make a very great demand on the timeof the police. If it should be decided to suspend the sittings of the courts forthe day of the Exercise, no harm would accrue to the administration of criminla justice, and a suspensory order can be made under powers already possessed bythe Secretary of State. It might, however, in this case be desirable that at least the Court at Bow Street should be kept open to deal with any urgent cases whichmight arise.The children&apos;s courts and the sittings of the lay magistrates involve no separate question of principle. They can be left to be dealt with according asthe general question of principle is decided one way or another.To sum up, from the point of view of general convenience it would be an advantage to suspend the sittings of courts on the day of the Exercise, because,even if many of the persons concerned were to reach the courts, it is likely that much of the business would be held up by the absence of some essential individual,and, consequently, much time would be wasted by persons who might be more
usefully employed. If this course is followed, some public notice will have to begiven for the guidance of those summoned to appear on the day in question.If, however, it is decided as a matter of policy that everyone on the day ofthe Exercise should pursue his ordinary engagements even at the risk ofinconvenience and failure, then no special action is needed a&amp; regards the courts.It will be their duty to carry on, if possible, and, if not, to take such steps asthe circumstances require.We now turn to our other head of enquiry the question of the legal resultson the relations of private persons one with another arising from the dislocationcaused by the Exercise. We are all clearly of opinion that these results are sovarious that it is impossible to foresee them in detail. Cases will, no doubt, arise in which A, being under a liability by contract to deliver goods on a particularday to B, is prevented from doing so by the dislocation of traffic. To attempt to foresee all the innumerable delays, inconveniences and failures ensuing, and toprovide for them so as to do justice between the parties affected seems to us to beimpossible. Similar delays and inconveniences resulting in breaches of contractmust have arisen many times since violent air raids on this country began. Forthe most part the parties affected succeed in composing their differences, andsharing the loss resulting from them without any assistance from legislation andwithout recourse to the courts. We are of opinion that they may be left to thiscourse. The law of &quot; frustration &quot; has very frequently in recent years formed the subject of legal decisions. It may be that some general alteration of thatlaw may be desirable. But, in our view, to attempt to adapt or alter that law tomeet this particular emergency is likely to result in far greater confusion than itwill avoid.We understand that all questions relating to compensation payable by theGovernment to persons whose interests are affected injuriously by the Exercise are under the consideration of another Committee.(For the Committee) :(Signed) CLAUD SCHUSTER.House of Lords, July 2, 1941.ANNEX IV.London Defence Exercise.Joint Report by the Ministry of A griculture and Ministry of Food.We have endeavoured to assess (a) the extent of the dislocation and of consequent inconvenience to thegeneral public, and(b) the probable extent of loss of food through deterioration likely to result from holding the proposed London Defence Exercise.In considering the matter we have taken into account the extent of the precautions that would be operated under conditions of actual warfare; andwhich could be put into operation on receipt of the &quot;Stand to&quot; signal. Indrawing up these precautions it has been necessary to bear in mind that under conditions of actual warfare a &quot;Stand to&quot; order might be operative either fora short or for a protracted period.Choice of day. The degree of dislocation caused to food distribution will vary considerably according to the day of the week chosen for the Exercise. Onthe assumption that a Sunday would not be acceptable for the purposes of theExercise, the Ministry of Food would strongly urge that it should not be heldon a day between a Friday and a Monday inclusive.The commodities principally affected will be: bread, milk, meat, fish, fruit and vegetables.
Bread.About a quarter of London&apos;s bread is made in small band bakeries. Thework of these bakeries will not be affected, and provided the public are advisedand in fact do collect their own bread, the proportion of the populationdependent on these bakeries will get their supplies.The remaining three-quarters of the bread supply of London is made in largecentral bakeries which are dependent upon road transport for distribution, whichin part at least has two stages : from the bakery to the distributing depot orwholesaler, and thence to the retail shops. The big bakeries operate continuously.At the moment when the alarm is given the hakeries will be operating, but,-having limited storage capacity on the spot, may have to cease baking; thedistributing depots and wholesalers will have received some supplies during the night and early morning, will be able to send none out to the retail shops andwill receive no more from the bakeries for an uncertain period. The retail shopsdependent on this supply will have no bread and will receive none for a period which may extend throughout the day.No precautions which can be taken in advance can materially affect this position. The only solution is to urge the public strongly on more than one occasion in advance that it is their duty, as a continuing precaution againstinvasion, to hold 48 hours&apos; supply of bread in their houses. The point willrequire considerable publicity. The public has become generally accustomed toconsuming new bread, and the bakers, in consequence, do not commonly themselveshold any reserve.There is at present a general public prejudice against stale bread. In sofar as this is not modified, the Defence Exercise will involve the wastage of a quantity of bread made in the central bakeries and undelivered on the day ofthe Exercise. This may mean a loss of bread equivalent to anything up to13,000 sacks of flour.Milk.Three-fifths of the milk supply of London is transported by rail, and thewhole of the supply for the day of the Exercise will have arrived in Londonovernight. At the time the warning is given the great bulk of this will still bein course of being bottled in some 30 distributing depots. Transport from thosedepots to the retail shops or direct to the consumer will not have begun and willbecome wholly impossible. In so far as areas are released during the day, itshould be possible to complete distribution in those areas, but in central Londonand in any other areas which are not released from traffic restrictions, not onlywill the public not receive their milk supply, but, particularly if the weather iswarm, that part of the milk supply will be lost. The loss might amount to anything up to 200,000 gallons.   This would fall on the distributors.It may be possible to make plans to, relieve this position to some extent by measures taken during the &quot; Stand to &quot; period, but, whatever is done, it mustbe anticipated that many people, including hospital inmates, infants and nursing mothers, will miss their supply for the day.There are a very large number of producer-retailers who operate in and onthe fringe of the Metropolitan Area, and supplies may be largely wasted exceptin so far as their customers can be persuaded to collect their milk personally.Meat.Some  300,000&apos;s worth of meat is distributed within the London Metro-politan Area each week. Approximately 40 per cent, of this is handled onMonday. The quantity at risk on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday wouldprobably average about 20 per cent, of the total on any one day. In so far as the meat, is held in insulated rail or road vans, the risk of deterioration is slight..There are 31 wholesale meat distributing depots in the Metropolitan area.They do not possess cold storage facilities, but they would not hold any consider-able quantity of perishable meat at the time of the commencement of the Exercise.Provided the Exercise is not held on a Monday, the distribution of meat to the retail butchers, in London of the week&apos;s supply of meat should not be seriously affected. -The meat is the property of the Ministry of Food and no compensationproblem would arise.
Apart from meat for consumption in London there may be considerable quantities on rail from West Coast ports for the London cold stores. Since thismeat would be consigned in insulated vans, any delay in unloading should notintroduce serious risk of deterioration. There may be some loss of meat in transitbetween rail-head and cold store.Live Animals.There are 5 collecting centres receiving live animals in the London Area anda few centres outside the area which draw some stocks from within it. TheMetropolitan collecting centres would not operate op the day of the Exercise.Fish.The average quantity of&apos;fish arriving in the Metropolitan Area daily is ofthe order of 400 tons, valued at about  150 a ton. Much of this fish, if it were held up at the rail termini or at the wholesale markets for any considerable period, might be lost.  The loss would fall on the trade.It is thought that arrangements can be made to divert the traffic to alter-native markets as a normal procedure on receipt of a &quot; Stand to &apos;&apos; signal.Fruit and Vegetables. \The date at which the Exercise is held substantially affects the problem of fruit and vegetables. Quantities of the perishable fruits will be coming intoLondon daily during July. The season for them should be virtually over by thebeginning of August. During July the other market produce principally at riskwould consist of lettuces and a group of semi-perishable vegetables, such as peas,cauliflowers and tomatoes, which, while they would not be lost if they suffered aday&apos;s delay, would certainly deteriorate and fetch a lower price on a subsequentday. In early August the produce at risk would again consist mainly of the semi-perishable vegetables, together with such fruits as plums and early apples, whichagain would not suffer materially from a short delay, and other vegetables, suchas potatoes and possibly beans and cabbages, which would survive a short periodof delay without deterioration.No statistics as to the value of daily deliveries of such produce are available.Any loss would fall wholly on many of the growers.The loss will be reduced by measures which can be put into operation on receipt of the &apos;&apos; Stand to &apos;&apos; signal to divert produce to alternative markets.
