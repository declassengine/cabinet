TfiCo DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. COPY NO.^p^C41)  169.iRtn July,  1941..WAR CABIMET.&apos;Policy of the Communist Party.Memorandum by the Home Secretary,I think it desirable to place before the War cabinet for their inforraatpnin p summary of the more recent information relating to.the policy of the Communist PartyAfter Germany&apos;attack on Russia the line to be takenby the &quot;Party was considered by the Executive -Committeea^nd the view then taken as to future policy may besummarised as follows.- 1    :;Two wars are now being waged - the Fascist war against the Socialist Fatherland on the one hand and theImperialist war between the German Imperialists and theBritish and American Imperialists on the other hand.    Itis. right for the peoples of every country to support theSoviet Union-In the struggle but this.does not mean thateveryone who now supports the Soviet - Union does so fromright motives.&apos;-    The &quot;motives of the British ruling classare as corrupt as they have always been.    They desire tostrengthen the Soviet Union in order that her war withGerma-riy may be prolonged for the dual purpose of weakeningtheir Imperialist rival and weakening the Soviet Union.If Germany begins to suffer military reverses the Britishruling class will withdraw aid to the Soviet Union andtry to prevent an outright victory for the Socialistcountry.    The Communist Party welcome Mr. Churchill&apos;declaration only because they want to focus attention upon these statements of policy by the Imperialists and somake it more difficult for them when they subsequentlyseek to betray the Soviet Union.    The existing situationcalls not so much for a -change of Party policy as for achange of emphasis.    The emphasis is to be changed froma demand for a People&apos;s Government to a demand forfriendship and co-operation with the Soviet Union.    TheParty vail collaborate with the Churchill Government whileit pur-sues the policy of :aid to the Soviet Union,, but thetime will come when Communists will be able to say thatthe Government&apos;has not kept Its word&quot;and that it must bereplaced by a Government which will aid the Soviet union and so.defend Britain.   .Some comrades have found itdifficult to decide, whether in the desire to aid theSoviet Union the Party should not call a truce in theindustrial struggle in Great Britain5 but It would be ofno assistance to the Soviet Union to call such, a truce,, becaussuch-a truce would weaken the- strength of the workers&apos;organisations and they must be strong -in order to protest against the treachery of the Government when that treachery
becomes apparent.    Communists must call for the dismissalfrom high places of/the pro-Fascist elements in theGovernment and\lay--great emphasis on the demand forthe lifting&quot;of the ben on the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;.As a result &quot;of the discussion at that meeting amemorandum was issued to the Party at the end of June tothe following effect:       ...Our main task-is to mobilise the British peoplefor joint action with the Soviet people and to force onthe Government all possible measures of common action.The British Imperialists, despite their hatred of theSoviet Union, have found themselves compelled&apos; to announce a policy of temporary collaboration with the Soviet Union,but this collaboration is still&apos; limited.      Thereactionary pro-Fascist and anti-Soviet forces in Britaincontinue to prepare the way for a counter-revolutionaryagreement with Hitler on the basis of the-common fighta.gainst the Soviet Union, , . .    TlietCommunist Party puts forward, the following immediate demands t-  .-   -- Full military and diploma tic- agreementbetween Britain and the Soviet; Union.&apos;.    Romove allpro-Fascist, and anti-Sovietreactionaries from places - of power&apos;,&apos;Public trial of Hess and -publication&quot; ofall the recent secret negotiations.. VEnding&apos;of corruption, waste and-. - disorganisation- in industry.Equal distribution of food supplies -and.&apos; -adequate air raid protection.     .,     - &apos;-    Restoration..of working class and democratic.   &apos;;.,    rights&apos;and&apos; raising of the ban on the/&quot;Daily. Worker &quot;...;        &apos;&apos;    -: &apos; &apos;    HI.-    &apos;   ^ -    ; &apos; &quot;Subsequently,&apos;however, a further change has been madein the policy of the Party.    A new circular was issued on&apos;the 8th&apos; July and signed by Harry Pollitt . &quot;on. behalf of the secretariat&quot;,    This circular says that Churchill&apos;S speech,Stalin&apos;s reply-and&apos;&quot;Eden &apos;s declaration at. Leeds create, a, new situation.    &quot;The Communist Party, naturally,  immediatelychanged its&apos;political line to meet the.new position.,.    it made changes that liave to be carried, through without mentalreservations of any kind-and not in any tongue-in-the-cheekstate of mind..-, The war for the defeat-, of Hitler is now the supreme, issue..... When Comrade Stalin refers to Churchill
:.: 1 ideclaration as a &quot;historic utterance&quot; this leaves no room fordoubt as to what our attitude towards this Government should be.Our fight is not directed against the Churchill government but those who are the secret friends of Hitler....  Thefact that the Churchill Government and the Soviet Unionare now fighting side by side is the outstanding feature^      of the situation.,.  Speculations on how long this co-operation will last are fatal at the present time.    They representdefeatism in the worst form.,. There are forces in Britainwho would like to make a switch but they are not the dominant force... Any standing aside by the Communist party and not pulling their full weight in the common effort to defeat Hitler, any putting forward of impossible demands, anyirresponsible fighting of by-elections in present conditions,splits the national fight against Fascism... We are preparedto give the Churchill Government our full support as theserious earnest of our intention to do everything in our power to achieve a united national front that alongside theSoviet Union can clef eat German Fascism. . . ,  The Communistcandidate at Greenock was withdrawn because though hecould have got a large vote &quot;we should have split thefront when our comrades in the Soviet Union are dying inthe defence of that front&quot;&apos;,..  In supporting the ChurchillGovernment we do it wholeheartedly without any reservationswithout harping on the disagreements of the past, or raising the fundamental differences between the Communist Party andother political parties.      In the light of what is happeningin the Soviet Union and can happen in Britain tomorrow, whatdoes it matter what Gallacher said about Attlee, or what the&quot;Daily Worker&quot; said about the &quot;Times&quot;,  or that.twelve Communistswere imprisoned in 1926 while Churchill was editing the&quot;British Gazette&quot;?The only concession which&apos;trie new circular makes tothe former policy of the Communist Party is contained in thefollowing paragraph:-&quot;What is the essence of this policy?    That wefight for full co-operation with the Soviet Unionthrough a pact of alliance with the Soviet union on the basis of mutual aid.    That we expose thefriends of fascism and clear then out of all government posts.    That we fight to organise themaximum production for victory,  the ending of wasteand disorganisation, the ensuring of equaldistribution of food supplies, and adequate A.R.P.protection.    In this way we are strengthening theprerequisites for victory and defending the dailyinterests of the people.    That we work to achieve the mobilisation of the entire people for victorythrough the&apos; fullest democratic activity andC initiative.&quot;(IV.No doubt there has been much controversy in the Party, and itis reported that many of the rank and. file are finding itdifficult to make the new switch over in policy as rapidly as
their leaders,&apos;, But for the present it seams, clearthat the section headed by Poll.itt, which &apos;was&apos;. defeatedwhen&quot;at the end .of September3 1939 the Partychanged their policy in accordance with orders from-Moscow,- is now dominant because fresh instructions/have presumably be en. received f r om Mo-sc ow,h.:HOME OFFICE,.--  16th July, 1941,
