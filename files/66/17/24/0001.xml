NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Shipping losses, though still below the average, have been heavier than of late.Four, possibly five, U-Boats have been sunk, of which two were German andthree were probably Italian.Naval forces continue to support our armies in the Eastern Mediterranean.Home Waters.2. The eleventh Canadian troop convoy has arrived safely in the UnitedKingdom.H.M.S. Malvernian (Ocean Boarding Vessel) was bombed and set on fire onthe 1st July when 480 miles north-west of Cape Finisterre, and the ship was abandoned. H.M. Sloop Scarborough has picked up one boatload of survivors,and further search is being made.Some casualties to H.M. Auxiliary Vessels have been caused by air attack;details are given in Appendix V.South Atlantic.3. The Vichy French ship Ville de Tamatave (4,993 tons) was intercepted by H.M.S. Dunedin on the 30th June about 750 miles south-east of Freetown,and D&apos;Entrecasteaux (7.291 tons) 260 miles south-west of Ascension; both ships are being sent into port under armed guards.Mediterranean.4. H.M. Submarine Union sank a southbound laden merchant vessel on22nd June about 50 miles north-west of Lampedusa.H.M.S. Naiad and three destroyers swept the Syrian Coast during the night26th/27th June and carried out a bombardment at dawn on 27th. The Dainurarea, south of Beirut, was bombarded on the 28th by H.M.A.S. Perth, H.M.S.Carlisle and five destroyers, and during the night 29th/30th June by FLM.S.Naiad and H.M. Destroyer Kandahar.H.M. Australian Destroyer Waterhen was hit by a bomb on 29th Junewhen 30 miles north-east of Bardia. She subsequently sank while in tow of H.M.Destroyer Defender, who rescued all her crew. When approaching Waterhento take her in tow Defender sighted a U-boat at close range, and probably sankher with gunfire.Reinforcements of fighters flown off from Aircraft Carriers arrived at Maltaon 27th and 30th June.HM. Submarine Torbay made a successful attack on a convoy on 2nd Julyin the Zea Channel (near Gulf of Athens), details of which are not yet known.H.M. Sloop Flamingo and H.M. Gunboat Cricket were heavily bombed on30th June off the Libyan Coast; both ships were damaged but were able to proceed at least two aircraft were shot down.During the week 7- French ships (19,000 tons) have passed Gibraltarwestbound and 3 (4,000 tons) have passed eastbound.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. Four U-Boats were sunk during the week and another probably destroyedby surface craft and submarine attack. Ten other attacks were made without conclusive results, of which five were carried out by aircraft, four by surface craft and one by submarine. Of those sunk, a, German U-boat, whichwas attacking a homeward convoy from Canada, was destroyed south-west of iceland (C) on the 27th June by H.M. Corvettes Gladiolus, Nasturtium andCelandine of the convoy escort, and on the 29th another was sunk south of iceland (C) by H.M. Destroyer Malcolm and the 8th Escort Group. An ItalianU-Boat was sunk by H.M. Destroyer Wishart on the 27th south-west of CapeSt. Vincent. In the Mediterranean HM. Submarine Triumyph sank a U-Boat onthe 27th north-west of Mersa Matruh, and another was probably sunk on the 29thby HM. Destroyer Defender north-east of Bardia, as previously stated in para-graph 4 above.
Enemy Intelligence.German.6. There have been no important changes in the positions of the largerGerman surface units during the past week. The two battle-cruisers and PrinzEugen were still at Brest, the Emden at Oslo, and a Leipzig-class cruiserat Horton, near Oslo. Tirpitz has now almost finished her trials, but willprobably take a month or more to work up before coming into active operation.7. The two Littorio-class battleships, oneof which was in dock, and one ofthe Cavour class were at Taranto on the 27th June.8. The estimated number of German TJ-Boats operating in the Atlantic was35 at the commencement and 28 at the end of the period under review. There hasbeen no activity in the Freetown area.Information of Italian U-Boats has been too indefinite to form an estimateof the number in operation.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. The heaviest losses in shipping occurred in a sustained attack by U-Boatson a homeward convoy from Canada, in which five ships were sunk, but threeU-Boats w^ere destroyed during the course of the attack, one of which was reported last week. Shipping was also attacked with some casualties north-west of theHebrides, south-west of the Canary Islands and the Cape St. Vincent area. east coast convoys were again attacked with some damage by aircraft, and ships were also damaged in Barry Docks.  No ships were sunk by mine.Protection of Seaborne Trade,10. During the week ending the 2nd July, 1,000 ships, including 176 allied and 17 neutral, were convoyed. Two cruisers, 13 armed merchant cruisers,59 destroyers and 96 sloops, corvettes and Fleet minesweepers were employed on escort duty.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the28th June totalled 953,270 tons, compared with 918,650 tons during the weekending the 21st June and an average of 867,115 tons for the past ten weeks. oil imports in 32 tankers, amounted to 345,170 tons compared wdth 239,174 tons in22 tankers during the previous seven days. Mineral imports were 145,466 tons,of which 93,771 tons were steel, pig iron, scrap iron and iron ore. Thecorresponding figures for the previous week were 202,424 tons and 129,460 tons.Timber and wood pulp imports were 17,425 tons and cereal imports 230,271 tons,26 ships being fully laden with grain and flour. Other food imports were alsosatisfactory, amounting to 146,298 tons, which included refrigerated and tinnedmeats, bacon and hams 27,695 tons, sugar 13,016 tons, fruit 4,711 tons, cocoa10,890 tons, cheese 2,366 tons, tea 1,796 tons, butter 1,739 tons, eggs 1,048 tons,ginger 534 tons, honey 349 tons. There were 100 tons of rum from trinidad and 80 tons from Jamaica. Tobacco imports amounted to 1,689 tons. Importsof motor vehicles, aircraft and war materials were again satisfactory. :.British Minelaying.11. H.M.S. Plover laid 100 mines in the East Coast Barrier on the 27th June.Small numbers of mines have also been laid off the Frisian Coast, Cape Gris Nezand the French Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.12. Minelaying aircraft have operated every night this week mainly offthe East Coast between and including the Thames Estuary and the Humber,though the Tyne and Portsmouth areas and the Bristol Channel have each beenvisited once.   During the raid on the Bristol Channel mines were also dropped.Italian.U-Boats.[22679]b 2
in the Barry Docks. Aircraft were reported in the Downs area on the night ofthe lst/2nd July and mines have been laid.Mines dropped in the Thames Estuary on the night of the 24th/25th Junebecame active early on the 29th June shortly after a northbound Convoy of forty-seven ships had been swept through the known danger area.On the 25th June a LL Sweep detonated a mine in the southern part of theDowns, the first ground mine to be detonated in that area since July of last year.During the week 18 magnetic and 37 acoustic mines have been detonated in home Wafers, the majority of these off the East Coast. The mine totals aremagnetic 1,259, acoustic 821, and contact 911.Enemy Merchant Shipping.13. A report from Tientsin states that German ships in Japanese portshave been ordered to load goods originally destined for Germany via Siberia.They will presumably attempt to run the blockade. There are nine German ships,totalling 66,649 tons, in Japanese ports besides five ships, totalling 29,124 tons,which are engaged in Japanese trade under the Japanese flag. Among the nineships are the Havenstein, 7,974 tons, and the Ursula Rickmers, 5,050 tons, whichare said to be likely to sail soon from Dairen. It has been reported that Chinesecrews are being recruited in Shanghai for some of the German ships.MILITARY SITUATION.Russia.14. It is not possible to give a definite line that has been reached by theGerman Armies in Russia. Owing to the mobility of the large number of armoured and motorized formations engaged, it is more accurate to divide thefront into zones, any one of which may be a hundred miles or more in depth.(i) &apos;Finland. It has been reported that German and Finnish forces havetaken Kandalaksha, on the westernmost shore of the White Sea, thus cutting the leningrad-Murmansk railway and isolating Russian forces to the north.(ii) The Baltic States. Riga has been taken, and German forces areadvancing north-eastwards from Dvinsk, presumably with the ultimate object of cutting the Leningrad-Moscow railway.(iii) North of the Pripet Marshes. German forces advancing on the generalaxis Smolensk-Moscow have reached Minsk. Considerable Russian forces havebeen enveloped in the rear of this advance, and fighting continues near Bialystokand Traby.(iv) South of the Pripet Marshes. The German advance in this sector has reached! Rowne and is directed against Kiev, presumably with the object of cutting off the rich wheatfields of the Southern Ukraine.(v) The Roumanian Front. Apart from a bridge-head gained by theGermans at Skuleni, on the R. Prut, no advance has been made on this front.It is not clear whether this is due to Russian resistance or to the German desireto avoid damaging the crops of the Uhraine.15. The speed of the German advance indicates that considerable armouredand motorized forces are being used, with ample air support. The old Polish-Russian frontier has been crossed in two sectors : astride the Minsk-Smolenskrailway, and east of Rowne, in the direction of Kiev. In these two sectors themain thrust of the German armoured formations is probably concentrated, thatin the Minsk sector appearing somewhat the greater. The advance has consisted of a series of enveloping moveinents, German armoured and motorized forcesusing their mobility to the full in order to surround the Russian armies.Libya and Egypt.Operations.16. The situation in Tobruk has been generally quiet during the week and no major events have occurred. On the 25th June we advanced a distance of500 yards on a 2.000 yards front in the Medawa Salient, thereby helping tostraighten out the position and effecting an economy of troops required to guardthis sector.
Throughout the week in the Frontier Area there has been increasing patrolactivity on both sides, but very little actual contact.Enemy dispositions.17. 55 Italian division last identified at Sirte has moved to Derna. Thisleaves only one definitely identified division between the Tunisian frontier andBarce, a distance of some 800 miles. It is possible that this gap is to some extentfilled by the 133 Armoured Division which is reported to have arrived in Libyaand to be located in the Jedabya-Barce area. Even if the presence of thisArmoured Division in Libya is confirmed, there still remains a large area whichcan hardly be left denuded of troops. It is, therefore, likely that convoys whichhave recently arrived (including at least one of four large liners), have broughtapproximately one division or its equivalent to Libya.Abyssinia.18. In the North, where our forces are containing the Italians in theirstrong natural fortress of Gondar, the enemy made a sortie against the patriots inthe area of the Wolchefit pass and inflicted heavy casualties on them.19. The Italian Commander at Debra Tabor has agreed to surrender onthe same terms as those imposed by us at Amba Alagi. The strength of the enemyleft in the Gondar area is estimated at 5,000 white troops and 9,000 Africans.20. In the South-West of the country mopping up of isolated and dispersedunits continues as subsidiary operations to the main thrust against the remainingcentre of organised Italian resistance. This is in the area bounded approximatelyby the roads running from Ghimbi to Mencli, from there South to Dembidolloand thence eastwards through Gore back to Ghimbi. The Didessa River, which forms a natural obstacle along the eastern flank of this area, has now been crossedat two places, and our columns may be expected to move forward more rapidly as soon as bridging operations are complete and permit the transport of M.T.Ghimbi has been captured with some 3,000 prisoners.Our patrols are moving down from Assab along the Assab-Dessye road,clearing demolitions as they go.Syria.Operations.21. The fighting continues against the Vichy French who are putting upskilful and determined resistance. In the Damascus area the Free French have occupied Seidnaya, 14 miles North, and have advanced North-east along theHorns (S) road as far as Nebek. The enemy counter-attacked here on the30th June, but were repulsed. Our troops, attacking positions 15 miles North-West of Damascus, are held up by Vichy artillery fire.22. The Vichy French at Palmyra, encircled by Habforce, put up a stoutresistance, and our troops continue to be dive-bombed. On the 30th June theenemy recaptured the north end of a ridge 5,000 yards North, but were drivenout again on the 1st July. Detachments from Habforce have occupied Sokhne,40 miles North-East, and Saba Biya, 60 miles South of Palmyra, and another ofour columns has advanced to 8 miles South of Deir-ez-Zor.23. After severe fighting the town of Merjayoun once more fell into our hands, but the road up the Lebanon valley is held by the enemy in the Hasbaiyaarea.   Difficult country in this sector must tend to make our progress slow.24. Along the coast our troops have made steady but slow progress clearing up enemy concentrations south of the main Vichy defensive position, which liesfrom Damour on the coast to the hills. The main attack here has not yetdeveloped, but our naval and land forces are shelling enemy positions.French troop movements.25. During the past week there have been many reports of the move ofFrench troops, arms and equipment from Metropolitan France through Germany,Italy and the Balkans to Syria.
26. It is considered unlikely that Turkey will agree to French reinforce-ments passing through her territory at any rate for the present. Reports thatM. Benoist Machin had gone to Ankara to negotiate the repatriation of theFrench army from Syria through Turkey appear to be entirely withoutfoundation.Intelligence.Dispositions of the German A rmy.27. The main feature of the present distribution of German divisions is aneastward movement from the West, Central Germany and Norway towards theRussian front.28. From the speed and power of the German thrusts into Russia, and from our knowledge of German tactics in previous campaigns, it is probable that thebulk of Germany&apos;s armoured, motorised and active infantry divisions is taking part in the present offensive. The total number of armoured and motoriseddivisions in the German army is now believed to be twenty in each case, and itseems probable that most of them (with the exception of 15th Armd. Division in libya and some no doubt still refitting after the Balkan campaign) will be operating on the Eastern Front.29. The total of divisions remaining in the West is believed to have beenreduced to a maximum of 50, of which not more than six are active divisions.Spain.30. There is little doubt that a Spanish Force to fight against Russia isbeing organised in Spain on a voluntary basis. Reports received so far indicatethat rather more volunteers have come forward than might have been expectedconsidering Spain is a war-weary country. Most reliable reports put the numberof volunteers to be despatched at some 20/25,000 all ranks; even with favourablerecruiting the figure of 50,000 mentioned in some newspaper reports is consideredunlikely. It is understood that all arms, equipment and M.T. will be provided byGermany on arrival in that country.The danger from the British point of view lies in the fact that this organizedbody of pro-Axis supporters may not reach Russia and still be in Spain, if andwhen Hitler decides to put pressure on Franco to join the Axis.AIR SITUATION.General Review.31. In weather which often made operations difficult, our night bombersmaintained the intensified operations of the last three weeks. Casualties havebeen comparatively heavy. Daylight escorted raids and sweeps by fightersresulted in numerous combats over enemy-occupied territory.German bombers have displayed very little activity over this country.In the Middle&quot; East, many enemy aircraft have been destroyed both in theair and on the ground with small loss to ourselves. A number of merchant vessels were successfully bombed and torpedoed between Sicily and Tripoli (Libya) and sustained attacks have been made on Tripoli and Benghazi.Germany and Occupied Territory.General.32. Bomber Command despatched 208 sorties by day and 748 by; night.Fighter Command carried out daily sweeps over Northern France.Day.33. Aircraft of Bomber Command continued their offensive operations against targets in North-East France and Germany, in the course of which hits were registered on Steel Works at Lille, Power Stations, at Comines and Pont-a-Vendin nearby, a crowded railway yard near Oldenburg, runways and buildings at Merville Aerodrome and the seaplane base at Borkum.
34. The attacks by bombers on objectives in France were made with fighter escort, and fighter sweeps were also carried out over these total of124 squadrons being employed. We lost 11 bombers and 24 fighters, but the pilotsof 2 Spitfires were rescued. Ten aircraft were destroyed by our bombers, whoprobably destroyed 3 more and damaged 7. Our fighters shot down a total of39 Messerschmitts, including a number of Me. 109 Fs, probably destroyed 15 moreand damaged 18.35. The increase in German defensive patrols noted last week was main-tained, the average being 290: per day over the Straits area, though on the27th June these reached the exceptional figure of 590 sorties.Night.36. During the week variable weather was experienced, with severeelectrical storms, local fog and thick ground haze. Our total sorties against objectives in Germany decreased slightly compared with last week, and on one night operations were restricted to the laying of sea mines; on the remainingnights of the week attacks were continued against German ports and communica-tions and heavy industries in the Ruhr. Large-scale attacks on Cologne,Dusseldorf and Bremen were made on three nights.37. A number of big fires were started in the main target areas, includingthe Blohm and Voss shipyards at Hamburg, the Deutsche Werke shipyards atKiel and the Focke-Wulf factory at Bremen. A particularly violent explosionwas reported at Duisburg, and explosions following one of two attacks onCherbourg lasted for ten minutes. An electric sub-station at Rotterdam is thought to have been hit. Naval units at Brest were attacked, and bombs are believed to have straddled the Scharnhorst.38. The tonnage of bombs dropped during the period under reviewtotalled 767, and included a number of the heaviest type, the effect of which isreported as most impressive, illuminating streets and buildings with a deep redflame and, in one instance, causing A.A. gunfire and searchlights to stop for sometime. A total of 71,250 incendiary bombs was also released. From all our night operations, thirty-eight of our bombers are missing.39. The effort of the defensive enemy night fighters, operating in their normal areas, has noticeably increased. With the exceptional visibility in the past few nights, they have enjoyed some measure of success. It is estimated that the night fighter patrols around Ostend on the night of the 30th were the heaviestyet put up in this area.United Kingdom.40. Fighter Command flew 1,084 patrols, involving 3,613 sorties by day,and 494 patrols, involving 788 sorties by night, including dusk and dawn patrols.These totals include the fighter operations reported in other sections. The effort of the German long-range bombers decreased both by day and by night.41. Very few enemy aircraft crossed our coasts in daylight, the activitybeing almost entirely confined to armed reconnaissance of shipping. A noticeablefeature of reconnaissance work during the past week has been the interestdisplayed in South-East Eire, though this is probably due largely to its use as anavigational check by inexperienced crews.42. At night, the total of long-range bombers was only 184, the majority ofwhich were operating off the coast. A small-scale attack was made on SouthWales on the night of the 30th. Scattered attacks were made in East Angliaand East Scotland and South-West England. Two enemy aircraft were destroyedat night.Coastal Operations.43. Coastal Command fUrw 286 patrols (417 sorties) and provided escorts for77 convoys (210 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols carried out by fighter Command totalled 807 (1,671 sorties).
44. During operations against enemy shipping, a 3,000-ton enemy merchant vessel off Dunkirk was hit and left with her stern below water. Two merchantvessels of 5,500 and 3,000 tons respectively were sunk off Norderney, and a500-ton trawler was sunk off Terschelling. A heavily-laden tanker was attackedoff Boulogne and is believed to have been hit by a torpedo.45. Bomber Command despatched a total of 40 aircraft to lay sea mines inthe Elbe Estuary and off Heligoland; 17 aircraft from Coastal Command weredetailed for similar operations off Brest and Lorient.46. Minelaying by a total of about 95 enemy aircraft was carried out off theEast Coast, in the Thames Estuary and in the Bristol Channel. The scale of enemy attacks against shipping remained small. Some of the anti-shipping units are now engaged in the Russian campaign. Hostile action consisted of attackswhich took place at night off the East Coasts. Two attacks by aircraft of theCondor Unit were made in the Atlantic.Central Mediterranean.47. Aircraft operating from Malta have attacked shipping between sicily and North Africa and bombed objectives on the North African mainland.Wellingtons carried out five night attacks on Tripoli (L), in two of whichthey were supported by Swordfish. On one of these occasions seven Swordfishlaid sea-mines in the harbour. The Spanish and Karamanli Moles were hit many times and a number of fires were started. Bombs were also seen to hit one large-and one medium-size merchant vessel, and a vessel of 6,000 tons was set on fire.48. Successful day attacks on Tripoli (L) were also made by Blenheims andMarylands. On the 29th June, Blenheims failed to locate a convoy, and, as analternative, bombed and completely destroyed a factory to the east of the town.During an attack on the harbour on the following day, six direct hits were madeon a merchant vessel, probably the Esperia (11,000 tons), and two hits were seen on the Oceania (20,000 tons) or Neptunia (12,000 tons); seaplanes on the water and disembarked troops were machine-gunned. On the 3rd July, an attack wasmade on shipping outside the harbour. Three ships, two of 5,000 tons, were seton fire. Other daylight attacks by Blenheims were made on the aerodromes atTamet (23 miles West of Sirte), Sorman (40 miles S.S.W. of Tripoli (L) ) andZuara; at least ten grounded aircraft were destroyed, while others were seriously damaged and personnel machine-gunned. At Horns (L) (65 miles E. ofTripoli), the coastal road was bombed, a lorry was destroyed and a reservoir hit&apos;.49. At dusk on the 25th June, four mary lands attacked a convoy of fourlarge merchant vessels of about 20,000 tons, escorted by six destroyers, and scoredat least one direct hit. Later in the same evening seven Swordfish torpedoed twoof the merchant vessels which probably sank, and possibly hit a third. It isbelieved that this convoy proceeded into Taranto Harbour, where one merchant vessel similar to those attacked was later identified. From these operations, oneMaryland and one Swordfish are missing. Another convoy was attacked by threeMarylands on the 29th June, 30 miles off Tripoli, and near misses observed.50. On the 27th June, one S. 79, escorted by 25 Macchi 200&apos;s, attempted a reconnaissance of Malta. Hurricanes attacked the formation and shot down6 Maeehis, probably destroyed 2 others, and damaged the S. 79. On the30th June, two more Macchi 200&apos;s were destroyed. A night-bombing attack onthe Island, on the 27th/28th June, did not cause any serious damage.Egypt and Cyrenaica.51. Activity in this theatre has remained comparatively slight during theweek. Wellingtons have delivered attacks on most nights on the harbour atBenghazi; many direct hits have been scored on the Cathedral mole and a numberof fires reported.52. Fighters have flown numerous protective shipping patrols; on the30th June a series of attacks were made on naval units off the African Coast, as a
result of which six German and two Italian aircraft were shot down, and anotherGerman fighter probably destroyed; the German casualties included four dive-bombers.  Our casualties were one Hurricane and one Tomahawk.53. Enemy aircraft bombed the landing ground at Sidi Barrani on the26th June and destroyed two M.T. vehicles and a quantity of petrol. On thefollowing day one of our military patrols was attacked and eight vehiclesdestroyed, and on the 1st July 35 enemy aircraft took part in an attack on Tobruk,but caused only minor damage to the jetties.54. Three night attacks have been made on Alexandria, but these were noton a heavy scale and the resultant damage was not considerable. The bombing ofthe town is, however, having its effect on the civil population and is creating botha refugee problem and a shortage of labour.Syria.55. During the week, few enemy aircraft were encountered in the air;however, a series of very successful raids on enemy aerodromes and landing grounds were made, in which Tomahawks of the Royal Australian Air Force,Blenheims, including some based in Iraq, and Hurricanes participated. A totalof sixty-two enemy aircraft was destroyed or damaged on the ground, in additionto which hangars, buildings, petrol and ammunition dumps and railway sidingswere hit by bombs.56. Protective fighter patrols and bombing attacks were made in supportof our land forces in their attack on Palmyra. On the 28th June, Tomahawksof an Australian unit shot down six enemy Glenn Martins which were attackingour troops in this area, and Blenheims repeatedly hit and set on fire barracks and stores in Palmyra. Attacks were also made on Beirut, where there has beena marked increase in. A.A. opposition; hits were scored on the Residency, theCentral Quays and shipping alongside the Mole. At Suweida, the Citadel andmilitary barracks were hit. Our aircraft have flown a number of sorties againstmotor transport on the Damascus-Beirut road, in the Rayak valley, and on thecoast road near Horns (S), destroying a large number of vehicles. Patrols havealso been flown in protection of naval units.5.7. Reinforcements for the French Air Force totalling 80 bombers, 87fighters and 9 other aircraft have been sent to Syria since the 25th May.Further reinforcements are still available, and it must be expected that they willbe despatched in the near future. Up to the 30th June, 64 French aircraft hadbeen destroyed, 8 probably destroyed and 60 damaged.East Africa.58. Hartebeestes and Ju. 86&apos;s of the South African Air Force have continued their support of land operations in the Gimma area, and have bombed and machine-gunned enemy camps, transport and bridges. In the North, Wellesleyshave concentrated their attacks on transport and buildings round Gondar with considerable success.Russia.59. It has now been established that, from the Baltic to the Black Sea,German Air Force operations are being carried out by a number of operationalcommands with a combined strength thought to be approximately 2,500 aircraft.The greatest striking force appears to have been engaged in support of tankthrusts forming a pincer movement to the north and south of Minsk, where ithas been operating to the fullest capacity since the opening of hostilities. Therehas also been considerable activity in the Lemberg area and, to a lesser, degree,along the Baltic Coast in the direction of Riga. From the Roumanian Sector andthe extreme North of Norway there is little to report, and no large-scale Air Forceoperations have so far taken place. About forty German bombers are reported at Rovaniemi, and 55 to have arrived at Helsinki from Norway.60. Russian aircraft attacked Constanza on the 22nd June. The docks are reported to have been severely damaged within two hours, and all the search-lights in the port destroyed. Eight Finnish towns were attacked on the 25th;Finnish fighters and A.A. guns destroyed eight Russian S.B. bombers without loss.[22679] c     -
61. The Swedes have now informed the Germans that their aircraft wallbe attacked if they fly over Sweden, with or without aggressive intention. Theyhave also refused a German request for emergency forced landing grounds onSwedish territory, but&apos;have agreed to the passage of one non-operational aircraftper day on communication work between Trondheim and Rovaniemi.Air Intelligence.China.62. The more intensive bombing of Chungking, which was resumed at thebeginning of June, has been continued in the last week by further heavy raids onthe Chinese capital, including one on the 29th June, when the British Embassywas completely destroyed and injuries sustained by Embassy personnel. these attacks are possibly another desperate attempt on the part of the Japanesemilitary authorities in China to break Chinese resistance, which their land operations have failed to do, but are hardly likely to have any more success thansimilar unsuccessful attempts in the past.United States.63. On the 8th May the Caribbean Air Force was established, and displacedthe Panama Canal Department Air Force. This new Command, which will bethe largest tactical Command in the history of the Army Air Corps, will includethe new bases being constructed in the British West Indian possessions, as wellas units, at present stationed in Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal Zone.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.64. The only occasion on which bombs have been dropped on land duringthis period, was on the evening of the 27th June, when two bombs were dropped atArbroath, on the Angus coast.By Night.65. Bombing during the week has again been on a very small scale, andprincipally near the coast, where parachute mines have again been reported.On the night of the 28th/29th June bombs were dropped at Hull, and on the night of the 30th June/1st July South Wales was attacked during the heaviest raidof the week.66. Otherwise there is nothing of importance to record, although bombs were dropped at different times in Lincolnshire, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, Somersetand Cornwall.Damage.South Wales, 30th June/1st July.67. Only slight damage wras done to the docks at Cardiff, Penarth andBarry, but the last two were closed for a time owing to unexploded parachutemines. Considerable damage was done to property in Newport, where over100 houses were affected.Elsewhere.68. Some damage was done to houses and mains in Hull on the night ofthe 28th/29th June and in the docks, but it was not serious. The DowrieChemical Works at Arbroath were hit and wrecked in daylight on the 27th June.Casualties.&apos; 69. Casualties for the week ending 0600, the 2nd July, are estimated at42 killed and 68 seriously injured.  There were again no casualties in London.
