THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET.INFORMATION AND PROPAGANDA.THE main functions of the Ministry of Information are : (a) to ensure that news regarding the progress of the war shall reach thepublic as fully and as quickly as is consistent with the interests ofour national security; and(b) to publicise and interpret Government policy in relation to the war, tohelp to Sustain public morale and to stimulate the war effort, and tomaintain a steady flow of facts and opinions calculated to further thepolicy of the Government in the prosecution of the war.For the effective discharge of these functions, it is the duty of the Ministerof Information to preserve intimate and cordial relations with the newspapers -through their proprietors, editors and reporters; and to make the newspapersfeel that the Ministry is their friend and the pump and channel by which information is collected from the various Departments.The Government fully recognise the importance of an effective service of news and propaganda; and the arrangements outlined below have been madewith the object of enabling such a service to be organised and maintained, while at the same time securing that the essential interests of national security are properly safeguarded.News and Censorship.2. The issue of news and official communiques will continue to be canalisedthrough the Ministry of Information.In the interests of national security, however, the publication of war news from the Fighting Departments, or from Civil Departments in their connectionwith the war, must be subject in the event of dispute to the veto of the Depart-mental Minister concerned.To enable this security control to function speedily, the three service departments will maintain in the Ministry of Information an officer of adequateseniority and standing who (except when matters of the highest policy are involved) can take final responsibility for passing any particular item of newsfor publication. These officers will be men who are capable of taking quickdecisions and understand the importance of news service as part of our propa-ganda war.The Service Ministers concerned will be readily accessible to determineimportant issues of policy which cannot be decided by their representativestationed in the Ministry of Information; and each of these Ministers willdesignate an official of the highest standing in his Department who will beempowered to- take a final decision if he is not himself available.The right of veto will not be exercised unreasonably, and it will be understoodthat a final decision must not be unduly delayed. Where the representative of a service Department stationed in the Ministry of Information objects to thepublication of a particular item of news, and persists in his objection after discussion with the Ministry of Information, then, if the Ministry of Informationnevertheless think that there should be publication, it will be the duty of therepresentative of the Service Department to refer the matter to his Department,,where it will be considered forthwith and a decision taken.It is to be understood that only the Service Minister or the official designatedto take decisions on his behalf will be entitled to override the view of the Ministerof Information in favour of the publication of a particular item of news.3. It will be the duty of all Departmental Ministers, especially the foreign secretary and the Service Ministers, to keep the Minister of Information fullysupplied with all the news and information at their disposal. The use andexploitation of this news will be regarded as primarily the responsibility of theMinistry of Information., Operational communiques issued as such by the Service- Departments or byCommanders on the war fronts must not be altered, even in form, without the[22672]
consent of the Minister concerned. But the Minister of Information must be free to make the fullest use of the substance of such communiques e.g., in issuingsummaries of the day&apos;s news being himself responsible for ensuring that nothingissued under his authority is inconsistent with the terms of the communiquesthemselves.4. The general duty of censorship, like that of exploiting news, will remain a function of the Ministry of Information, who, armed with the general know-ledge derived from their contact with the Departments and with the War Cabinet,will correct, prune or amplify the whole flood of news reaching them from everyquarter.Departmental Ministers will, however, retain their right to veto or requirethe publication of particular facts or statements where they think it necessary todo so in the interests of national security.Publicity : General.5. Departments which have Public Relations Branches and Press officers will preserve their existing contacts with the Press on matters of a purely depart-mental nature.Similarly, Departments will continue to be responsible for the issue of depart-mental publications and of directions to the public on departmental matters the Ministry of Information continuing, as in the past, to help so far as may be mutually convenient.6. On the other hand, the Ministry of Information will act, in co-operationwith the Departments concerned, as the central agency for the conduct of allpublicity which affects more than one Department or subserves the policy of theGovernment as a whole.All organised propaganda carried out on behalf of one or more Departmentsthrough-the medium of the Press, films, posters or radio will be conducted throughthe Ministry of Information. All paid-space advertising will be, not only placed,but planned and carried through at all stages, by the Ministry of information in co-operation with the Departments concerned.7. In carrying out his tasks the Minister of Information has a right to theloyal assistance of every officer and civil Department concerned.All Ministers must therefore be held responsible for seeing that their public relations Officers collaborate fully and effectively with each other and with theMinistry of Information in the organisation and conduct of propaganda relatingto the prosecution of the war. In any inter-Departmental work they shouldfunction, not independently, but as members of a team under the Chairman-ship of the Ministry of Information furthering the purposes and policy ofthat Ministry. Nothing in this plan need prevent the use of a departmental organisation for the execution of a particular project (e.g., the making of a film),where that is generally recognised to be the most convenient course, but this must not derogate from the responsibility of the Ministry of Information overthe field of propaganda as a whole. Instructional films, such as those preparedby the War Office in connection with the training of troops, are on a different footing and should remain the responsibility of the Department.The Treasury will be asked to consider with the Departments concerned whatrearrangements of personnel may be entailed by this new alignment of functions and responsibilities.B.B.C.8. The Ministry of Information will take full day-to-day editorial controlof the B.B.C. service of news and propaganda and will be responsible for bothinitiative and censorship. It will be the duty of the Minister of information to carry with him, so far as possible, the Board of Governors, who stand asumpires and sureties to Parliament for the spirit in which the B.B.C. isconducted.Speeches.9. The Ministry of Information will also conduct, when necessary, speakingcampaigns in the country with the object of maintaining public morale at ahigh level through the largest number of competent exponents.
10. Ministers who are members of the War Cabinet and those who regularlysit in with them, namely, the Service Ministers, the Home Secretary, theSecretary of State for Dominions, the Colonial Secretary, as the Leader of theHouse of Lords and the Minister of Information are free to make speechesexpounding the policy of the War Cabinet. However, the making of speechesby many different Ministers in time of war is to be deprecated because of thedanger of discrepancies occurring, which can be used to stultify theAdministration. Ministers of Cabinet rank, in the pre-war sense, including theService Ministers, should speak on their Departmental work when this is indis-pensable, but they would be well advised to consult the Minister of information on any passage about which they may have doubt, especially if it lies outside their departmental sphere. All Ministers should, of course, always consult the ForeignOffice on any matter affecting our relations with foreign Powers, including, ofcourse, any direct appeals to the public in foreign States. It is undesirable that, as a general practice, Ministers other than the War Cabinet ministers should deal with military topics. Should they desire to do so, they are requestedto consult General Ismay, representing the Minister of. Defence, on any particular points outside broad and common knowledge. Ministers not of Cabinet rank and Under-Secretaries ought not to discuss the general policy of the war, apartfrom exhortations to zeal and the happy re-statement of the accepted common-places, without reference to the Minister of Information.July 2nd, 1941.
