THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (41) 172.July 20, 1941.TO BE KEPT  UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to -.ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.JAPANESE PLANS IN INDO-CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues recently gave their approval to certain measures, includingthe tightening of economic restrictions on Japan, which could be taken in replyto the expected Japanese occupation of bases in Southern Indo-China (see cabinet conclusions No. 66 (41) 7).2. Our intentions have been communicated to the United States Govern-ment by Lord Halifax, who is making enquiries as to the economic action whichthe United States propose to take in the same eventuality, in order that ourmeasures may be brought into line with theirs. Precise details have not yet beenobtained, but the United States authorities have spoken of the possibility of thefreezing of Japanese assets and of a complete embargo, if not on the export toand import from Japan of all commodities, at least the export of certain keycommodities, such as oil. Lord Halifax has been asked urgently to elucidatewhat the United States Government have in mind.3. A complete embargo in the literal sense of the stoppage of all currenttrade between the United States and Japan (or a complete freezing of japanese assets which if applied in such a way as completely to deny their use would have practically the same effect) would be likely to force the Japanese to choose between two grave alternatives, namely, completely to reverse their pro-Axis policy, or topreyed with their southward move to the point of war with the Netherlands east indies and ourselves in an endeavour to obtain control of sources of raw materials.Even a complete embargo on oil might have this effect.4. Faced with these alternatives, and particularly if we (and perhaps theDutch) acted in complete conformity with the United States, Japan might wellchoose the first alternative; nevertheless, the risk remains that she would choosewar with us, hoping that the United States would not intervene in time. Thequestion therefore arises whether we are prepared to go the whole way with theUnited States if they desire to take such drastic action; and, if not, whether weshould attempt to restrain the United States.5. Hitherto we have been consistently advised by the Chiefs of Staff thatwe should not allow ourselves to become involved in war with Japan over Indo-China, and that, in general, we should do everything possible to avoid war with japan in the absence of a firm guarantee by the United States that they will support us if attacked a guarantee which, in the nature of American arrange-ments, constitutional and otherwise, it is probably idle to expect. At the sametime I cannot conceal from my colleagues the dangers inherent in our laggingbehind the United States Government in dealing with Japan, a fortiori in our11436   [22737]
actually attempting to dissuade them from firm action. The risk of creatinganother Simon-Stimson incident and of seriously weakening the ties between us and America is real.6. My own view is that the issue with Japan must be faced sooner or laterand that the risk of the United States not intervening in a war between ourselves and Japan is small. The only question is whether we should join with theUnited States in forcing this issue now in connection with the acquisition of bases in Indo-China (manifestly directed against ourselves and the netherlands east Indies); or whether we should try to dissuade the United States from forcingit until Japan makes a further and even more threatening move, e.g., in Thailand,or, alternatively, until Japan embarks on hostile action against Russia.7. We do not know whether the United States would be prepared, havingregard to internal political considerations, to go so far in economic action in thelast two eventualities. Indeed, we have been given an indication that in the caseof Thailand they would definitely not be so prepared. In the event of theJapanese becoming embroiled with Russia, it can be argued that our chances ofexerting effective pressure on her would be increased and the risk of attack onourselves diminished. On the other hand, if Japan had gone to the length ofhostilities with Russia she could scarcely turn back until she had achieved herends or been militarily defeated.8.   Weighing all these considerations against each other, I conclude :  (i) that we must on no account discourage any action which the UnitedStates may wish to take in pressure on Japan and that we must asfar as possible match our action with theirs;(ii) that, although from our own point of view the best moment to force theissue might be when (and if) Japan became involved with Russia, wemust, in the paramount interests of Anglo-United States co-operation,be prepared to follow a United States lead in forcing the issue overthe Indo-Chinese bases; and(iii) that, if we are called upon to go to lengths which involve a plain riskof war between ourselves and Japan, we should make every effort toobtain the clearest possible indication from the United States that,if war between the British Empire and Japan follows, consequent upon an attack by Japan either on ourselves or on the Dutch, we can count, without reservation, on the active armed support of the UnitedStates.A.
