THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.SECRET. / Copy No.W.P. (41) 154.July 6, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.JAPANESE INTENTIONS IN INDO-CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WE have sure information to the effect that the Japanese Government, whilepreparing for all eventualities in Eastern Siberia, do not intend to take actionthere in the immediate future; but that they have decided to acquire pointsd&apos;appui in Indo-China in order to increase pressure upon Great Britain and theUnited States of America.2. Now that the Japanese Government have taken this decision, they maybe expected to give effect to it rapidly. There is no indication of the method bywhich they will proceed. It may be by a pretence of negotiation, but there is evidence that they intend to use force if necessary.3. It is possible that a prompt display of interest may disconcert theJapanese Government and interfere with their plans. The above informationcannot be utilized publicly without compromising its source. The British presshas, however, been encouraged to show interest in a press message telegraphedfrom Shanghai on the 3rd July to the effect that rumours were current there thatit was Japan&apos;s intention to acquire naval and air bases in southern Indo-Chinaand Thailand. Sir R. Craigie was also instructed on the 4th July to enquire ofthe Japanese Government as to the truth of these reports and to emphasize the seriousness of the situation which would arise if, in fact, there were any founda-tion for them. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington was simultaneouslyinstructed to suggest to the United States Government that they should take similar action in Tokyo.4. In their Far Eastern appreciation of the 31st July. 1940, the Chiefs cfStaff stated that it was important to try as far as we could &quot; to prevent japan from gaining unhampered one position after another which would increasinglythreaten the security of Malaya and our communications with Australia andNew Zealand.&quot; It is essential, therefore, that there should be a marked andswift reaction on our part, and if possible on the part of the United States also,to the new Japanese move. The Far Eastern Committee have considered thefollowing courses of action, and I give my recommendations in respect of each : Strategic.Defence measures in Malaya.5. In order to prevent serious risk of Trojan Horse activities in Malaya,the Commanders-in-Chief, Far East and China, have recently recommended that ships should not be allowed to load iron-ore, &amp;c, at night off the Malayan coast;11425   [22689]
that lighters should remain inside harbour and that no vessel over 1,000 tons beallowed to arrive at anchorage between sunset and sunrise. Although the defenceconsiderations in favour of this measure were very strong, there was the objection that it entailed a drastic curtailment of the production of Japanese-owned mines in Malaya, and the consequent danger that the Japanese wouldinterpret the measure as primarily intended to operate as an economic restric-tion upon them. In the event of a fresh Japanese advance in Indo-China,however, this objection would clearly lose its force. Instructions have accordingly been sent to the Governor of the Straits Settlements authorising him, in consul-tation with the Commanders-in-Chief, Far East and China, to bring the measureinto force immediately if and when the expected Japanese move in Indo-Chinamaterialises. Such action could also be taken in the event of a further demandbeing made upon French Indo-China in advance of any military move.Movement of Australian troops to Dutch Timor and Ambon.6. The Singapore conferences in February and April contemplated the reinforcement of Dutch Timor and Ambon by Australian forces in the event ofhostilities with Japan. Subsequently the Australian Government suggested thatthe move would be advisable in advance of hostilities. It was then considered,however, that this was scarcely feasible in the absence of some further Japanesemove to justify it. Such justification would be provided by a Japanese move inSouth Indo-China, and, if my colleagues authorise the move in principle, thenecessary approach to the Netherlands authorities will be made now.Political.Denunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigationof 1911.7. &quot;In 1939, at a critical point in the relations between Japan and thiscountry arising out of the Tientsin crisis, President Roosevelt denounced theCommercial Treaty between the United States and Japan. Although thisdenunciation was due to become operative only after six months and had no immediate practical effect, the political and psychological effect upon the Japanesewas considerable. The practical importance of the denunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty would be small, but it is considered that it would serve as aserious political warning. Notice of denunciation takes twelve months in thecase of this treaty to become operative, but the fact of the notice being givenwould bring home to large sections of the Japanese public, especially the tradingcommunity, the risks of the course upon which Japan was embarking. This movewould also have the advantage that it would bring His Majesty&apos;s Governmentinto line with the United States Government and, as distinct from the strategicmeasures mentioned above, would receive the widest publicity and thus appeal tothe imagination of the American public. The Far Eastern Committee had atan early stage considered this measure as a retort to the possible acquisition by japan of bases in South Indo-China. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo, whowas then consulted, saw advantage in the proposal, but asked to be consultedagain. There is also the Dominion point of view to be considered. Canada aloneis a party to the treaty, but it is clear from previous consultation that Australiahas doubts about taking such action Further urgent consultation with HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador and with the Dominion Governments will therefore benecessary, and I propose that this shall be undertaken forthwith.If the Government of India were to take similar action in respect of their commercial convention of 1934, the effect of our denunciation would be muchenhanced.Closure of Japanese Considate-General at Singapore.8. Closure of this Consulate-General would deal a serious blow at Japaneseintelligence network and would be welcomed by the Services in Malaya. this step would, however, lead to retaliation, and it is recommended that this actionbe held in reserve for use at a later stage. Meanwhile, the Governor of theStraits Settlements should be invited to prepare the necessary grounds on whichthis step can be taken if thought desirable.
Propaganda.9. It will be necessary to give the right publicity to the various measuresunder contemplation. The purpose of these measures will not be lost upon theJapanese Government. It will be desirable to avoid in our publicity, however,any emphasis on the retaliatory character of the measures, each of which shouldbe justified on its merits, e.g., security, changed conditions, and the like.Economic.Restrictions on Exports to Japan.10. Extensive restrictions on the supply of raw materials, particularly thoseof strategic value, are already in force. These could be made more stringent, asconsidered appropriate.Restrictions on Imports from Japan.11. The Australian Government recently suggested that as a possiblereprisal against some new Japanese forward move, a system of restrictions on japanese imports would be desirable. This would naturally depend on the full co-operation of the United Staets, especially as, for example, in the UnitedKingdom, Japanese imports have dwindled to very small amounts. A telegramis being despatched to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington to sound theUnited States Government on this proposal, but it cannot be considered as animmediately effective reply to the expected Japanese move, since it would requiretime to organise, and its effect would only become evident at a later stage.Consultation with the United States Government.12. In so far as these suggestions are approved by the Cabinet, I would propose to communicate them fully to the United States Government, and to enquire what steps they on their part are contemplating. From indications givento His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador by the United States Under-Secretary of State,there is reason to suppose that they may be prepared to react and to apply some form of economic pressure.Conclusion.13. Of the measures suggested above, those most suitable on an emergencyarising are : (1) The defence measures suggested in Malaya.(2) The movement of Australian troops to Dutch Timor and Ambon.(3) The possible denunciation of the commercial treaty.I trust that (1) will meet with the approval of my colleagues. I would alsoinvite their approval of (2) subject to the concurrence of the Governments of theNetherlands, Australia and New Zealand. Finally, I suggest that the dominions governments and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, be consulted urgently as tothe desirability of denouncing the commercial treaty in order tJhat the Cabinetmay be in a position to take a rapid decision if the Japanese move in Indo-China.A.
