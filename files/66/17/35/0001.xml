(41)163 - 2 Ci(Also P,0,Q.(41)O. COPY NO.        /WAR CABINET.LORD HAWKEY1S COMMITTEE ON PREVENTING OILPROM REACHING ENEMY POWERS.Eighth Report01. An exceptional opportunity offers itself at this moment for a concerted Anglo-Russian attack on enemyoil supplies.      For the first time oil war on two Frontsis possible;    such an opportunity may never occur again,.2. The nev/ factors are:( i)      Loss of Supplies to the Energy.Russian supplies have ceased.      Roumaniansupplies -are heavily mortgaged for Germany&apos;sEastern Front;      they are also exposed toattack by air and sea.(ii) Consumption of Oil by Germany   is greatly   ;increased by the Russian campaign.(iii) Transit of oil from Roumania through theStraits and Aegean can&apos;be interrupted.Rail transport to Germany is probablydislocated by war conditions.3. We recommend:(a) An approach to the U.S.S.R.  on the highest level proposing a concerted effort on both fronts against enemy oil supplies.We stress the moral importance of   a concerted effort at a time when theU.S.S.R.  are asking for a diversion.(b) The R.A.F.  to undertake a series of heavy and sustained attacks on German,synthetic oil plants and refinerieswithin range, extending them as thenights lengthen.

n 9i O(c) The U.S.S.R. to continue and increase their air attacks on Roumanian  oiltargets, and to supplement them &quot;byfrequent naval bombardment of Roumanianand Bulgarian oil ports.(d) The U.S.S.R. to &quot;be asked to take naval action by surface vessels and &quot;bysubmarines against sea transport and enemy war supplies between Roumania,Bulgaria and the Bosphorous to supplementour naval and air patrols off theDardanelles and in the Mediterranean.k&apos; This scheme, we believe, provides one of themost promising possibilities of co-operation betweenthe United Kingdom and U.S.S.R.. for limiting theGerman war effort.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeHANKET,Chairman.w...-^---t.
