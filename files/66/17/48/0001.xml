THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (41) 175.July 19, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document/WAR CABINET.BLOCKADE POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I WISH to call the attention of my colleagues to a problem which our blockade measures are likely to raise for us in the near future.2. The blockade of Germany and the occupied countries of Europe has the strong support of our public : indeed, in the early stages of the war there was too great a tendency to regard it as a decisive weapon in itself. Having survivedthe initial period when powerful neutral opinion had to be conciliated, it hasnow been accepted by the remaining neutral countries abroad with varying degrees of resignation. Our blockade measures continue to be an irritant in ourrelations with a number of countries, and in particular with Portugal: but theonly diplomatic difficulties which we have lately encountered have been certainincidents with Latin American countries over enemy exports. More seriqqs thanthese are the strong appeals for food relief for the allied populations interritory now occupied by Germany. It is to these latter that I now wish to draw attention.3. A year ago the Ministry of Economic Warfare were able to answersuch appeals by stating that there was no clanger of famine in Europe duringthe winter of 1940-41 if food were equitably distributed. Thanks to this argument and to the general support of the United States Government, we have so far been able to maintain the food blockade intact save for a temporaryconcession affecting a few shipments of wheat, and dried milk for unoccupied france which we permitted at the request of the United States Government.4. We have nevertheless been subjected to severe pressure from certain ofthe allied Governments and from a section of United States opinion led byMr. Hoover. The Belgian, Norwegian and Greek Governments, in particular,have been able to make out plausible cases of serious hardship, but we havebeen fortunate in that the allied Governments in general admirably led by theDutch have declined to respond to Mr. Hoover&apos;s invitation to aid him in makingtrouble for us in the United States of America.5. At present, therefore, we are in as satisfactory a position as can beexpected, but we must now reckon with a change in the situation.6.   The entry of the Soviet Union into the war and the damage caused bythe German campaign in the Balkans may seriously affect the European food situation this winter.   We may no longer be able to maintain that there is or should be no starvation.   A shortage of fuel oil would still further hamper11438   [22740]
the distribution of supplies which will in any event be short. We may be sure that when the pinch comes it will be the allied peoples and not the Germans whowill be made to feel it first. We shall accordingly have no answer to give theallied Governments, except that their people are suffering in the same cause asthat for which our own people have endured bombardment from the air. There is reason to think that the enslaved peoples in general understand the situation andare willing to make the necessary sacrifice; but there may be limits to theirendurance. We must expect some of the allied Governments, particularly theBelgian, Greek and Norwegian, to press this view strongly upon us.7. The risks that we run in continuing too rigid an enforcement of thefood blockade are :  (a) That we may alienate United States sympathy;(&amp;) That we may find ourselves in serious difficulties with the crews ofallied merchant vessels in our service whose families are still in the occupied countries.   This applies especially to Norwegians.(c) That we may alienate sympathies of allied Governments and peoples.8. As regards (a) I think that the United States Government and people are now so deeply committed to give us support in the prosecution of the war that Mr. Hoover&apos;s campaign will not seriously affect the attitude of either theAdministration or of public opinion. As regards (&amp;) we must exercise great care to prevent disaffection from feeding upon this grievance. This we can only doby assiduous solicitude for the welfare and contentment of the men. (c) Raiseslarger issues which require more consideration than they have yet received.9. In bringing this matter to my colleagues&apos; notice I assume that they will wish to continue a strict blockade. I do not suggest that we should here and nowdetermine upon a departure from that policy, though naturally I reserve theright to plead occasionally for flexibility in its execution where I consider this expedient. For the present all that I ask is that my colleagues should take note of what I conceive to be the probable consequences of the maintenance ofthat policy; and meanwhile I would propose (1) That the Minister of Economic Warfare should be asked to prepare assoon as possible a general forecast of what food conditions are likely to be in thevarious occupied countries of Europe during next winter; and(2) That a small committee of my colleagues should be appointed to consider with the Minister of Economic Warfare and myself any major questions inconnexion with the blockade which may arise from time to time and to report upon them to the War Cabinet.A.
