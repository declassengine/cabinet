THE POOD BLOCKADE AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic. Warfare.I have discussed with the Foreign Secretary his paper on Blockade Policy (W.P.(hi)175) and, as requested by him, I attach a general forecast of the food situation next winter inGerman-aocupied. Europe.2.       The arguments against allowing food through the blockadeare still, in my view, overwhelming.      &quot;At this season of theyear and for some months to come, there is the least chance ofscarcity as the harvest has just been gathered in.     The onlyagencies which can create famine in any part of Europe now and during the coming winter, will be German exactions or Germanfailure to distribute the supplies which they command.&quot;    these words, spoken by the Prime Minister a year ago, are still true.There will be enough food in Europe next winter to meet theneeds of all countries.       There will be no starvation, nor evenacute shortage, unless the Germans fail to distribute the suppliesfairly.3*        It is quite impossible to ensure that, if we let foodthrough, there is no benefit to the enemy, but only to theoppressed peoples.       These peoples will obtain from our charityonly such crumbs as the enemy allow them and perhaps none at all.h.       What we concede to one Ally, we must be prepared to concede to all.       If, because conditions are specially bad insome areas, we send food to these, the Germans will soon arrange that conditions elsewhere become bad enough to lead us a stepfurther.       Therefore, if we let in any food, we must let in......substantial quantities, and the gain to the enemy will be great.5.       The food blockade is an essential weapon of economic warfare.      If we let in food, we make possible the transfer ofGerman man power from food production to the production of munitionsor service in the armed forces:    also we ease the strain on theenemy&apos;s transport system.6.       On the other hand, -I raise no objection to purchases withinthe blockade area which do not increase the total supplies available,but merely divert food towards the areas of greater need.     Wehave told the Belgians that, with certain safeguards, they may buyPortuguese products.     We are trying to help the Greeks to buyIn Turkey.7.       We can also help the Greeks in another way.     We can let the Italians know that our treatment of their compatriots in EastAfrica depends on the Italian treatment of the Greeks.8.       Some say that the people of the occupied territories willbe more pro-British if we let food in.      I do not agree.     Mr.Allen, the Head of the American Red Cross in France, recently reported to the Foreign Office that the French were quite preparedto pull in their belts and suffer.       The French, he said &quot;blameliUL.   uttiauuu   iuj.    uiio   o      x o a. uuu   ianu.   uno,y   uo-tuuo   uo   i ui-allowing supplies to go in.&quot;       Mr. Allen also said that theGermans/-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.W.P.(U1 )176.

Germans would allow no publicity to the American Relief shipments.Still less would they allow it if such shipments went to the occupied territories.       Mr. Allen was against allowing any supplies, except vitamins and milk concentrates for children, toenter unoccupied Prance.       As regards the occupied territorieshe said that there was no possibility whatever of any adequatesupervision and consequently no guarantee that anything that mightbe sent would reach the people for whom it was intended.9.       Our own Parliament and public are increasingly opposedto any further relaxation of the blockade.10.      As regards the suggestion made in paragraph 9 (2) of theForeign Secretary&apos;s paper, I do not feel that the appointment Ofa Ministerial Committee to consider Blockade questions isnecessary.        Our two Departments keep in constant touch onthese questions and will, I am sure, continue to do so.      I see no advantage in adding to the machinery of consultation by settingup yet another Committee.H.D.Ministry of Economic Warfare.28th July, .
doThe following is a brief statement of the probable food situation next winter of the various occupied countries ofEurope,      It assumes the correctness of present harvest forecastsand the. maintenance of administrative efficiency at its present level,    The harvest for Europe as a whole, is expected to be rather better than last year and within 10$ of the pre-war normal,1* Hon---allieel countries.     Denmark, Hungary, Roumania and bulgaria have&apos; and. &quot;should continue to have a sufficiency of food for their own needs and valuable surpluses for export.2* France,     Supplies in both zones &quot;can probably be maintained at about their present level in the coming year.    This level isdistinctly low for     townspeople, but country people generally have enough.3. Allied countries ) Yugoslavia should normally have enough for her own con-sumption and some surplus for export.    The effect of political andmilitary ravages is not known.b) The Czech Protectorate &amp; Holland.    In both countriesrations are low, but on the whole Just adequate to essential needs.    Hardship certainly results, but is not yet acute orwidespread.     The present level can be approximately maintainedfrom home production, given a. small supplement of wheat in thecase of Holland.    The Protectorate has a large surplus productionof sugar.c) Poland on a low standard of living used easily to meether own needs.    Germany has annexed the most fertile part ofthe country and here there has been a substantial increase in production.      In the rest of Poland food production is inadequate9and there is severe shortage in the towns, enhanced by mal-administration arid German ruthlessness.    This situation will&apos;p r ob ab ly co nt iriue,d) Norway depends on imports for most of its bread andall its&quot; sugar, but is in other respects normally not ill provided.Stocks of grain existing at,the time of the occupation are nowexhausted,  and Germany appears recently to have been supplyingenOugh to cover the bread ration as well as some sugar.    Germanytakes from Norway valuable supplies of fish and fish oils, and gives comparatively little in exchange.    For this reason Norway&apos;sconsumption of fats as well as of bread and. sugar has been considerably reduced and, the climate being severe, there is somemalnutrition -locally.    Should Germany cease to supply grain,conditions would be very serious.e) Greece is in a position generally similar to that of norway, depending on imports for the greater part of herbread and all her sugar,but for very little else.    The standardof living was never far above subsistence level, and stocks,when the country was overrun, were very small.    Consequently ashortage.of food has since developed which is certainly acute andpossibly widespread.    The future depends on the amount of grainwhich Greece is able to Import.    On the other hand, Greece isa potentially import-ant source of dried fruit and olive oil tothe Axis-larder.
f) Belgium is poorest of all European countries in foodresources.&quot;   She is- highly deficient in oread grains, meat    andfata, and unlike Greece and rorway, does not produce a surplusof anything.    In addition, there, seems now to be a shortage,for human consumption, of the usually plentiful potato, whichis being fed to animals.    Assistance received from germany during the past year has not been enough.    Malnutrition is widespread among the town dwellers.    This is likely to groww ors o, unless-. ext ra imp ort s arc ob t a ined.SUMilARY1.      Thar:;,  is, however, and will be in the coming year, enoughfood in Europe to meet the essential needs of all&apos; country.es,if ;fairly distrlbuted.    This wight mean the disgorging byGermany of some of hex1 largo grain reserves,  estimated at about 3 million tons, but it could largly be achieved by allowing the surplus produce of one occupied territory to be made availableto others.    Thus, meat from Denmark and wheat from the Panubiancountries might go to Belgium, Norway and Greece;  sugar fromthe Protectorate to Greece and Norway;    fish and fish oils from norway to Belgium.2.      If, however, there is no change in the present policyof the enemy, trie following results nay be expected next winter;possibly actual starvation, in some parts of Greece;    continuedmalnutrition In Belgium;    hardship perhaps tending to localmalnutrition in Holland, the Protectorate and Poland;    noshortage in the remaining occupied countries, except, perhaps in Yugoslavia.3.    The enemy, however, while not aiming at a just distributionof available supplies, will probably try to mitigate the mostextreme forms of distress;    it is not likely that Greece willbe left to starve, and probably something will be arranged to improve conditions in Belgium.    fhe German ideal for thesubject peoples is, no doubt, a bare minimum for those whowill work for them, and the goad of starvation for thosewho won&apos;t.
