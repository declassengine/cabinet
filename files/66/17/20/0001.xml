(41) 142.THE Ministry of Information comes to the Cabinet for improvement, and itgets a plan that makes things worse.Paragraph 1. The Minister had three Service Ministers exercising a veto.Now he is to have all the other Ministers on top of him with vetoes as well. all of them can crack down on news that may break, if they think their departments are improperly criticised.Paragraph 2 provides no improvement in the flow of news and merely makes a fixation of the operational communiques, thus depriving the Ministry of thefreedom to edit these communiques for the Empire broadcasts which it does now.Paragraph 3. Heretofore there were three Ministers exercising censorship.Now twenty Ministers will have that right.Paragraph 6 gives to the Ministry of Information the right to produce the film propaganda, and paragraph 7 takes this right away again, if the Department decides it ismore convenient.Paragraph 9 deprives the Ministry of its present complete authority overthe B.B.C.  This authority it must divide with the Governors.Paragraph 10 imposes on the Ministry the worst of all forms of control ofpublic speeches three-fold party control.Paragraph 11. Stripped of many of its remaining powers, the Ministry isenjoined to use its authority to sustain public morale.I advise enlarging the powers of the Ministry of Information, or abolishingit. The Ministry cannot go on in its present form. The Government will be involved in attacks on the system.12 Downing Street, S.W. 1,June 28, 1941.[22657]
