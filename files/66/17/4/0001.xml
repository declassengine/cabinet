CO 3.! (41) 481) COPY NO..WAR    CABINET.THE BURMA ROAD,REPORT BY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF.On the 28th. July we were invited by the War Cabinetto report on what action we advised in the event; of a japanese attempt to cut the Burma Road.      The views of theC.-in-C., Ear East, have been taken into consideration.Assumption,,2. In making our report we have assumed that our policyremains one of avoiding war with Japan,Subject to this overriding consideration, our aim,however,  is to do everything possible to encourage Chineseresistance so as to constitute as large a drain as possible on Japanese resources.Probability of Japanese Attempt to cut the Burma Road.30 Japan has been in occupation of Northern Indo-Chinafor many months, yet she has made no attempt to cut the.. Burma Road by land advance,  although she has carried outspasmodic air attack.      During this period,  conditions fora land attack have been more favourable than they are now.Our position in the Far East was weaker and Chinese morale lessstrong.We are therefore of the opinion that the extensionof Japanese occupation to Southern Indo-China is more likelyto presage penetration into Thailand (Siam) rather than anattempt to cut the Burma Road,  since  the occupation ofSouthern Indo-China does not in itself improve the prospects of Japanese land or air operations against the Burma Road.Importance of Burma Road to China.4. In view of the German attack on Russia, Russia may be compelled to discontinue sending supplies to China.The Burma Road would then assume an added importance as the sole remaining supply link between the Chinese forces and the outside world.Alternative, routes are under consideration, but these have not yet been surveyed and could not be completed in lessthan two years.      The Commander-in-Chief, Far East, suggeststhat the development of the North West route into China viaDigboy should be pressed forward at the expense of theproposed Lashio-Kunming Railway, which lies mostly Southof the present Burma Road and is therefore more liable toattack.The development of the railway is, however,  thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the urgent requestof the Chinese Government,  and should, we consider, be proceeded with.4-    W.M.(41) 75th Conclusions,

44Japanese Action ap;ainst the Burma Road,5. Japanese action might take two forins, separately orin combination - namely, air bombardment and land-attack.Past experience leads us to believe that air bombardmentalone will-not effectively cut the Burma Road,  though thepassage of supplies along it would be seriously interrupted anddelayed.      The most vulnerable points on the road are the bridgesacross the rivers Mekong and Salween,6. A land attack is likely to follow the line of the railway from Laokai in North Indo-China through Mengtze to Kunming(Yunnan Pu), a distance of 800 miles,,      The railway track hasbeen lifted for some distance on the Chinese side of the frontiers      A newly constructed road runs from Mengtze toKunming (180 miles),.Though a land advance is feasible,  communications arepoor and the terrain difficult,  especially in the rainy seasonfrom June to October,,      The size of the Japanese force wouldprobably not exceed 2 tc 3 divisions, relying mainly on supplyand maintenance by pack transports,  together with supportingair forces.      Under good weather conditions, we estimate thatthe advance from Laokai. would&apos;take,,  if unopposed, at&quot;&apos;leastthirty days,  if opposed, at least forty-five days0The successful occupation of Kunming would effectivelyprevent the Chinese obtaining supplies along the Burma Road,Chinese Dispositions and Plans,7, The Chinese are known to have strengthened their forcesrecently at Kunming (Yunnan Pu) y where there is an aerodrome,but we have no firm information regarding strength anddispositions,,      They-will probably be able to subject theJapanese line of communication to guerilla attack^      Thedesirability of preparing demolitions and defensive positions in the vicinity of Yunnan i-railway south of Kunming has beensuggested to the ChineeedAction Open to Us38. Assuming that we are not already at war with Japan atthe time she starts operating against the Burma Road,  it is clearthat whatever action we then take to assist the Chinese must beof such a nature that Japan is i%ot provoked into war against us-,This consideration rules out direct assistance to theChinese by our military forces,      Ner do we believe that themovement of forces within our own frontiers,  such as  the move of air forces from Lower Burma to the Shan States, is likely to deter Japan from making ah attempt tc cut the Burma Road shouldshe decide to do so0Assistance by us to China therefore must be limited tor-fa^ Action by the 204- Military Missionf b ) Provision of Ac A.,  --weapons(c) Assistance to International Air ForceAction by 204 Military Mission.,9, Coming on top of the recent political, economic andmilitary measures which have been taken against Japan, webelieve that the despatch of the whole Mission to China would provoke Japanese hostility and. lead to war,      VTe therefore donot advise taking this measure.

45The Commander-in-Chief, Far East, lias already initiatedthe infiltration of a limited number of officers for the purposeof reconnaissance.      These officers have &quot;been instructed to avoidincidents &quot;by Keeping well away from Japanese civil areas. /If the attack develops, we see no objection to the despatch,of a small number of British officers into China to assist theChinese in guerilla operations.We also agree with the suggestion by the Commander-in-Chief,Par East,  that personnel trained in demolition work might beinfiltrated into Yunnan to assist the Chinese in delaying a japanese advance towards Chungking.It is undesirable that these officers and personnel shouldbe sponsored by H.M.  Government,  and we suggest that they shouldbe enlisted into a volunteer corps in the same manner as volunteerswere introduced into Finland during the Russo-Finnish war.Provision of A.A. Weapons10.        In view of the deficiencies existing in our own A.A.  defencesin the Far East, nothing can at present be done to supply theChinese with A.A.  guns.The Commander-in-Chief, Far East, has already been authorised to hand over to the Chinese Lewis Guns for A.A.   and ground defence of the Burma Road as and when they become availablein the Far East as a result of replacement by Bren Guns,The supply of Bren Guns to Malaya is proceeding as fast asconditions allow.The International Air Force11. The formation of the International Air Force is proceeding and when it becomes operational it should prove animportant factor in preventing closure of the Road by air attacksor in support of the Chinese forces resisting a Japanese attemptto occupy Kunming (Yunnan Fu).We understand that the Burma Office considers that the- War Cabinet decision^ permits operational training in Burma,  TheCommander-in-Chief, Far East, has interpreted&quot;5&quot; it as precludingsuch training, and lie now suggests that the embargo should be lifted if the Burma Road is attacked.      He reports that it is atpresent very difficult to carry out operational training in China, .He had previously reported^ that he considered it reasonable toallow formation flying training in Burma, and that the Chinese had agreed to allow the International Air Force to operate from Burmaif Burma is attacked.In view of the potential value of the International AirForce,  and of Chinese assistance generally, we recommend that theWar Cabinet should review their previous decision with regard tooperational training and give permission for it to take place in burma now whether or not the Burma Road is attacked.      We considerrthat the presence of the aircraft in Burma constitutes the&apos;C  ! fundamental provocation to Japan, and that operational training-will be merely incidental.It will, however, be necessary to ensure that theInternational Air Force does not operate against the Japanese fromany aerodromes in Burma,,/   Telegram from Commander-in-Chief, Far East,  291/4Cipher 13/8j6   17.

46Action recommended in the event of a Japanese attack beingsuccessful or partially successful.IS. Trie Commander-in-Chief, Far East suggests certain measures which, might &quot;be taken as palliatives in the eventof a Japanese attack on the Burma Road &quot;being successful&apos;  orpartially successful.    He suggests - ,(a) The lifting of the embargo on export of petrol and the development of methods of smugglingfrom Hong Kong to China.We do not recommend this, as it seems unlikely materially to improve Chineseability to operate and is almost certain to lead to incidents which might resultin war.(b) The development of the North West Route intoChina via Digboy.This we have dealt with in paragraph 4 above(c) Assistance in operating an air transport service from Burma, to Chinese aerodromes.Our resources in transport aircraft are insufficient at present for us to inaugurate an air transport service,(d) Investigations into the possibility of supplyingmaterial to China via Vladivostock railway and via Persia and Central Asia.In view of the requirements of the Russianswe do not consider that any importantquantity of material could be supplied by these routes.Such small supplies as could be passed through Vladivostock could best bearranged by the United States Government.Supply via Persia would appear to be impracticable as a serious project.Conclusions.13. It is apparent that in the present situation, wherethe basic principle of our policy in the Par East lies in avoiding war with Japan,  there is little direct action we can take to prevent a determined attempt to close the Burma Road,    The measures we can take to assistthe Chinese if the attack develops appear to be limitedto infiltrating a limited number of British personnelinto China to assist the Chinese in guerilla operations and demolition work;    these should not be sponsored by ,- H.M.G. , but should be &quot;volunteers&quot;..14. We recommend that the War Cabinet should extend their present policy of assisting the International AirForce by giving permission for operational training in burma now,(Signed) DUDLEY POUNDJ.G.
