THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot;Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (41) 177.July 22, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.TECHNICIANS FOR TURKEY AND, POSSIBLY, IRAN (PERSIA).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE steel works at Karabuk in Turkey, which were built just before thewar by a British firm, have always employed a number of British technicians.It has been necessary from time to time to replace and reinforce these men, and towards the end of last year the Turks asked us to provide (a) 33 techniciansand craftsmen for these works, and, further, (b) 10 experts for their own militaryfactories. After combing all available resources we have at last succeeded in finding (a) 20 technicians and craftsmen, the release of the latter being subjectto the consent of the Iron and Steel Control, who have been approached, and(b) 4: Poles, whose contracts we hope will shortly be signed, and one British Armyofficer, the conditions of whose employment are now being examined.*2. The Turks have now asked us to provide a further 53 technicians fortheir munition factories over and above the 10 referred to under (b) of para-graph 1 above. They were told that in principle we undertook to supply thesemen and were asked to give full particulars of the posts to be filled. Theseparticulars have now been received.! Further particulars have been asked aboutthe remaining 9 posts.3. A similar question has now arisen in Iran (Persia). We are about toask the Iranian Government to rid themselves of the German technicans now inIran, and we must be ready, if necessary, to replace those Germans by Britishsubjects; in other words, we want to carry out in Iran a policy of counter-infiltration.4. My experience in looking for men of the kind referred to in the preceding paragraphs shows that it will be extremely difficult to find them, in spite of thefact that the Treasury have agreed to make up any deficiency in the salariesoffered by the Turks.   The difficulty arises from the following causes : (a) The men we require are already in full work in this country.(b) Many of them regard leaving England as unpatriotic at this moment,and, in any case, see little incentive to go to Turkey.(c) There is no machinery v/hereby they can be compelled to go.5. I fear, therefore, that as things are at present it will not be possible tocomplete the numbers required for the posts for which we have been trying tofind candidates since last year, or to find the 53 now asked for by the Turkish* Particulars of the posts still to be filled under (a) and (b) under the heading of theGovernment Department and the particular section of that Department on which they are thought to be dependent are available in tabular form if required.1 Particulars are available in the same form as *.11437   [22736]
Government, or those we may require to replace the Germans in Iran. If it is decided, on grounds of policy, that it is necessary that the Turkish governments request should be met, then special measures will have to be taken to ensure thatthe men required are made available without delay.6. Since there is a great need for British technicians in countries such asAustralia, South Africa and India, where we are transferring, or building up,our productive capacity outside the immediate danger zone, it may seem foolish,to send technicians to Turkey and Iran when we ourselves have such urgent need of them in our own Dominions. For it is true that by the diversion of skilled men to Turkey and possibly Iran we shall handicap to some extent the expansionof our own production, which, in its turn, will lessen the Turkish chances ofobtaining the armaments. and material they need from this country. There isthe further possibility that the technicians we send may eventually recommend the purchase of British machines which, in point of fact, we shall not be able tosupply, to the consequent annoyance of the Turks. Against this, many of thesetechnicians are required to help provide the ammunition referred to in para-graph 7, section (c), below, which we cannot in any case supply from our own resources. Another argument against sending these men is that, if the reportthat Germany is already short of skilled labour is accurate, she will not be able tooffer to the Turks German technicians in the place of those we have failed tosupply, more particularly since she is no doubt planning to use large numbers inRussia. I would hesitate td accept this argument, since the numbers required for turkey are relatively small, and Turkey is of such importance to Germany thatshe can, I think, be relied upon to make the effort.7. But against all these more or less technical objections I should like to stress again the overriding considerations in favour of finding and sending thesemen to Turkey.   They are as follows :  (a) The Germans have made a great success of the policy of infiltration.We should take a leaf out of their book, and if we have a large numberof respected British subjects usefully employed in important positions in Turkey at this critical period it will certainly increase our influence and prestige in the country generally.(6) The Turkish request, coming so soon after the conclusion of the Turkish-German agreement, is particularly significant and tantamount to an invitation to forestall the Germans; for if we miss this opportunity theTurks are bound to turn to the Germans.(c) By providing the men we shall be going far to ensure that the Turks are able to supply themselves with certain of their own requirements ofwar material, e.g., ammunition for their guns, which are of continentalpattern and the ammunition for which cannot be provided fromBritish or American sources.(d) The despatch of technicians provides admirable cover for introducinginto Turkey certain persons whom S.O.E., with my approval, are anxious to send.(e) The German invasion of Russia makes it incumbent on us to strengthenin every way we can our position in Turkey, so as to be ready to counter German pressure which would certainly be exercised there if and when German armies were to establish themselves in the Ukraineand the Caucasus.Considerations (a), (d) and (e) apply equally to the scheme for sendingtechnicians to Iran.8. That on balance we should make a special effort to provide the techniciansnow required by Turkey (and those who may be required by Iran), and that the heads of the Departments concerned (namely, the Ministry of Supply, theAdmiralty, the War Office, and possibly the Air Ministry) should be invited togive directions that the men should be made available at once.Conclusion.A.
