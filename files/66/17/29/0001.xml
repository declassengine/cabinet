THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.SECEET. Copy No.  9W.P. (41) 156.July 9, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.RECORD OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE FOREIGN secretary and THE MEMBERS OF THE SOVIET MILITARY MISSION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues for their information a record of a conversation which I had this morning with the Soviet Ambassador and themembers of the Soviet Military Mission.A. E.July 9, 1941.M. MAISKY this morning introduced to me General Golikov and the othermembers of the Russian Military Mission, who arrived in London yesterdayevening.After an exchange of courtesies, the junior members of the Mission with-drew and General Golikov and Admiral Kharlamov, with M. Maisky, remainedfor a brief conversation.General Golikov began by saying that he had been charged with a messagefor me from M. Stalin to the effect that Russia was fighting and would continueto fight, and that the German aggression would never succeed.The General emphasised that the vast bulk he put it at 80 per cent. of the German might was now being thrown against Russia. Prisoners of war from the German Air Force proved to have come recently from Africa, Greece,Sicily and other parts of Europe. The Russians estimated that there were now22 armoured divisions fighting against them. The General gave certain indica-tions of the dispositions of the German forces, which he will doubtless give more in detail to the Chiefs of the Staff, and which I need not therefore attempt to reproduce here.He said that the Mission had come here with two objects : (1) To discuss joint military operations; and(2) To ask for material technical assistance.He said it was essential that we should do our utmost to undertake operations which would draw some of the weight of the German attack off Russia.   I told the General that we had proceeded immediately to do what we quickly could by11429   [22702]
redoubled air attacks upon Germany. The General emphasised the enormouseffect that would be produced if we could subject Berlin to a bombardment, butI pointed out to him that at the present, owing to the shortness of the nights, thatwas difficult. The General rejoined that we must remember that at the presenttime Berlin probably had to rely on its ground defences, that most of the fighter aircraft had been drawn off to the East. I suggested to the General that this wasa matter which he should discuss with the Chiefs of the Staff, who, I was confident,would do everything that lay in their power.The General further represented that combined air, naval and land operations in the North, in the Petsamo and Murmansk area, might also contribute to relieve the pressure in the Central and Southern part of the line. This action I suggested would be a subject for discussion with the Chiefs of the Staff, whom the general was meeting this afternoon.Finally, the General said that he hoped we might be able to assist in thesupply of material, particularly aircraft, anti-aircraft guns and bombs. TheRussians were not short of this material, but with the intensity of the fightingthat had been raging their losses had naturally been considerable.We agreed that the immediate thing for the General and his colleagues todo was to get down to discussion with the Chiefs of the Staff, and I promised that at any stage I should be ready to do my best to help over any difficulties that might arise.A. E.Foreign Office, July 9, 1941.
