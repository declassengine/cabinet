E. BRIDGES.Great George Street, S.W.1July 11, 1941.Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office.(1/79495 cipher 6/7.)Your 73973 (D.D.M.I.(0)), 24/6.Personal D.D.M.I.(0) from D.M.I.Regret delay in replying. General Freyberg and other senior officers qualified to express informed opinions have been absent on duty. After full investigation,satisfied that German claims of alleged atrocities are without foundation. It istrue that parachutists who actually landed amongst our troops were killed toa man. Many were shot in the air, others were disposed of on landing. these latter had used Tommy guns and hand grenades in the course of their descentwith ferocity and without discrimination. Such action hardly invited lenienttreatment. General Freyberg is not surprised that German observers viewingbattlefields at Maleme, Galatos and in valleys west of Canea might obtain incorrectimpression. Percentage of killed in these areas on both sides was abnormallyhigh. Here some of hardest hand-to-hand fighting took place between 20th and21st May. Further, it should be stressed that 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigaderetook Galatos at point of bayonet on three separate occasions, and between20th and 27th May carried out eight different bayonet charges. 350 germans were captured and subsequently released before our withdrawal. Impartialexamination of these prisoners will elucidate fact that they were not onlyhumanely treated, but with every reasonable consideration. On other hand,General Freyberg lays grave charges of cruelty and disregard for ordinary rules of war against Germans. Following verified incidents are quoted : On 18th MayGerman aircraft persistently bombed No. 7 General hospital, which was well and[22711]
clearly marked, causing very many casualties. 20th May Germans orderedMajor Plimmer. O.C., 6th Field Ambulance, and another medical officer to come out of slit trench in which they were sheltering from air attack. Ondoing so, unarmed and with their hands up, a German deliberately killedMajor Plimmer with sub-machine-gun, remarking they could not be bothered withprisoners. Other Medical officer had miraculous escape. Same day, at Malemeaerodrome, our prisoners of war were deliberately driven in front of german troops attacking ridge to the south. Our prisoners of war were compelled tocall out to our troops not to fire. They were then made to lie down so thatGermans could fire over their prostrate bodies. When outflanked the Germansresponsible for this outrage were annihilated.
