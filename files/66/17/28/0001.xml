This memorandum shows that a comprehensive scheme of economic^restrictions on Japan has been evolved by the Far Eastern Committee out ofthe beginnings reported in W.P. (40) 484 of the 18th December, 1940, and thatthis scheme is now in operation throughout the Empire with the collaboration of the Netherlands and United States Governments.3. Our policy is based on the inescapable fact that Japan has allied herselfwith our enemies, and in present circumstances there is no alternative to thispolicy. It is not true, however, as the Japanese Ambassador has tried to contend(see paragraph 11), that the policy is one of vindictiveness. The measures of restriction involved are conceived as precautions taken in the interests ofprosecuting the war against the Axis and of self-defence. Their purpose isthreefold, namely (1) to conserve for our own use vital raw materials necessaryto the war effort, (2) to prevent such materials from reaching our enemies,and (3) to prevent Japan from accumulating stocks of these materials and thus to strengthen her power to make war on ourselves, the Netherlands East indies and the United States of America.4. That our restrictions should produce some reactions in Japan is inevitable. In so far as such reactions indicate a realisation on the part of theJapanese of the disadvantages of their allying themselves with the Axis, theyare not necessarily undesirable; indeed, it is our hope that we may bring home toan increasing number of Japanese the solid advantages to be gained by renewingJapan&apos;s former relations with us and renouncing her connexion with the Axis.Meanwhile, constant care and vigilance is being exercised by the Far EasternCommittee, in the prosecution of their policy, not to push restrictions to thepoint of provoking Japan to war either by reducing too drastically and suddenlysupplies, e.g., of oil, considered vital by the Japanese Government or by strikingtoo brusquely at Japanese enterprises within British territory. It must berealized, however, that if and when Japan judges for whatever reasons thatthe moment has come to strike at Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies shewill in all probability seize on our restrictions as a justification of her action.11426   [22691]Copy No.
5. The closing of the Siberian route by the outbreak of the Russo-german war has provided Japan with a plausible pretext for demanding the relaxation ofour restrictions. But in the first place, no one can deny that there is at any ratea possibility that the route may be reopened at no distant date under Germancontrol and with increased capacity. It would, therefore, be undesirable to allowJapan to accumulate stocks which could be rapidly transported across this railwayif that occurred. Apart from this, so long as Japan remains tied to the Axis, sheremains our potential enemy; the third main purpose of our economic restrictionsretains its force, and until there are signs of a radical reorientation of Japanesepolicy away from the Axis and towards ourselves, it would be premature to makeany change in the policy described in the accompanying memorandum.6.   Recent indications of Japanese intentions reinforce the above.A. E.Foreign- Office, July 7, 1941.ECONOMIC RESTRICTIONS AGAINST JAPAN.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.DURING the first year of war there was no systematic policy throughoutthe Empire of restricting supplies to Japan, though in the case of key commoditiessteps were usually taken to limit exports to normal proportions. In addition,certain commodities largely controlled in the Empire, for example, nickel, juteand mica, were more drastically restricted. These restrictions were imposedpartly to avoid the clanger of important commodities being sent across the siberian Railway, and partly to put pressure on Japan to induce her to sign aWar Trade Agreement. The United States of America had also taken certain measures. Thus they had imposed a moral embargo on a small range of exports and entirely prohibited exports of aviation spirit and scrap iron under theDefence Act; on the other hand, other exports, e.g., copper, were completelyunrestricted.2. After the collapse of France the situation rapidly altered. Japan signed the Tripartite Pact, and so publicly ranged herself on the side of the Axis, whilethe security of British possessions in the Far East became directly threatened by japan&apos;s declared intention of setting up a new order in Eastern Asia. It became necessary, therefore, to regard Japan not merely as a potential source of supply to the enemy but as herself a potential enemy, and to take steps to weaken hereconomy and prevent her from accumulating stocks which might make herinvulnerable to blockade in the future. At the same time, the strategical situationmade it essential to avoid any measures which might drive her to violentreactions.3. Accordingly, an approach was made in October 1940 to the Governmentsof the Empire and at the same time to the United States and Netherlands Govern-ments, with a view to the institution of a co-ordinated policy of limitation of exports to Japan. This approach was favourably received by the empire countries, though certain of them emphasised the danger of marching ahead ofthe United States. Nevertheless, the export licensing system was extendedthroughout the Empire, and the general policy accepted of limiting exports to japan to normal figures of all commodities which are regarded as German,Italian or Japanese deficiencies. Where stricter embargoes were already in force,these were, of course, maintained.4. The United States maintained and extended its specific embargoes,imposed haphazard, but showed much hesitancy in adopting a general system of rationing, being impressed by the danger of &quot; encircling &quot; Japan. The japanese were thus able during several crucial months materially to increase their reserves of many vital commodities, with the result that (apart from a few importantexceptions) they probably now hold about a year&apos;s stocks.   Our objective can,
therefore, no longer be merely to prevent the accumulation of stocks, but to forceJapan to draw on her reserves, which obviously creates a greater risk of violentreactions.5. After the Presidential election, the United States became more readyto co-operate. By now, they have subjected the majority of important commodities to export licence, and in practice when they place a commodity onthe licensing list they normally refuse all licences to Japan. Their practice is,therefore, more drastic than ours, though certain important commodities, such ascotton and mineral oils (with the exception of aviation spirit and lubricants), are subject to no restriction at all. They have also extended their licensing system to goods transhipped in the United States, which seriously affects Japaneseimports from Latin America. Finally, they have recently extended it to cover the Philippines, which had become a large supplier to Japan of such commodities as copra, iron ore, chrome, &amp;c, and it is expected that there will be severerestrictions on most of these exports.6. Apart from restricting Japanese supplies from or via the United States,the United States Government have also, largely at the instance of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, embarked on a comprehensive policy of purchases in Latin America.Their primary motive was to safeguard their own supplies, but the economic warfare aspect, which has always been stressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government,is coming increasingly to the fore, so that large-scale purchases, particularly of minerals, are now being made in Latin America with the partial object of denyinggoods to Japan and to the enemy.7. The Netherlands Government have shown themselves, in principle,anxious to co-operate in restricting exports to Japan. In practice, however, theyhave found it impossible, in the absence of any assurance of assistance from theUnited States, entirely to resist the Japanese demands for increased supplies.In particular, after the United States embargo on aviation spirit, the Japanesebrought strong pressure to bear to secure increased quantities of mineral oil fromthe Netherlands East Indies, and this pressure was largely successful. InSeptember 1940 the Japanese Government sent a special delegation to Batavia todiscuss the whole complex of economic relations between Japan and the Nether-lands Indies. This delegation appeared to have no instructions from its government, and the preponderance of service personnel in an ostensibly economic mission gave grounds for suspicion that the Japanese were more interested ininfiltration than negotiation. iVfter a good deal of pressure from the Dutch sidethe delegation eventually produced an agenda, a feature of which was a demandfor astronomic quantities of raw materials. Final Japanese demands weredelivered on the 14th May, and the Dutch said their last word in a memorandumof the 6th June. While firmly resisting every suggestion that the N.E.I. forms part of the &apos;&apos; co-prosperity &apos;&apos; sphere, the Dutch found it necessary to offer suppliesof important materials (including rubber, copra and nickel ore) on a more generous scale than we had wished. Their offers did not go far enough to satisfy the Japanese, who, after a violent press campaign which failed to move the Dutch,then withdrew their delegation. It is understood, however, that the Governor-General has agreed to regard the quotas offered as constituting a gentleman&apos;s agreement if the Japanese will accept Dutch desiderata on the same basis.8. The Free French have also introduced quotas (on a somewhat generousscale) for their exports to Japan from the French Pacific Islands, and this has ledto somewhat acrimonious complaints from the Japanese accompanied by radiopropaganda to the inhabitants of the territories.9. Meanwhile, in the Empire itself restrictions have been graduallytightened. A certain number of commodities are embargoed entirely on supply grounds (e.g., nickel and ferro-alloys). Other embargoes, e.g., on scrap iron, havebeen imposed to conform with United States policy. In other cases restrictionshave been increased for purely economic warfare reasons. Thus, no furtherlicences are to be granted for rubber and tin from Malaya this year, owing to the excessive quantities which Japan is now obtaining from other sources. Similarly,an embargo has been placed on exports of copra from most parts of the Empirem view of Japan&apos;s abnormal imports, particularly from the Philippines, and ofthe evidence that she has been sending copra and other fats to Germany.  In fact,
80 per cent, of the commodities sent across the Siberian Railway is believed tohave consisted of fats of one kind or another. Additional restrictions have alsorecently been placed on other exports to Japan, e.g., pig iron, lead and zinc, and proposals are under consideration to tighten the restrictions on manganese, juteand other commodities. India and the Colonial Empire have been co-operatingclosely with us in these restrictions. The policy of the Dominions has not been so easy to co-ordinate; Canada, for example, has imposed some embargoes against our advice, while Australia and South Africa have, on occasion, been reluctant to restrict their exports even to normal quantities.10. Apart from our restrictions upon exports, Japan&apos;s difficulties have been aggravated by the withdrawal of British and Allied shipping from Japanesecharter, and she is now suffering from an acute shortage of shipping.11. It is inevitable that our restrictions should produce some reactions in japan. But care is being exercised not to impose such restrictions to the extentof provoking Japan to war. Thus, with the exception of copra and an embargoplaced by the Canadian Government on wheat, little has been done to interferewith Japan&apos;s food supplies. For example, Burmese rice is open to her to buy atwill. Japanese reactions to date may be summed up as follows : The Canadianembargo on wheat was followed by a veiled threat to withdraw the JapaneseDiplomatic Mission in Canada. The embargo on copra led to urgent appealsand protests in Tokyo, Canberra and London. An embargo imposed in HongKong on exports of scrap iron, wolfram and gall nuts caused a similar outburst,and the Japanese intimated that Hong Kong should be regarded as having some special relationship in economic matters with the Japanese Empire. Thissuggestion was firmly rejected. Again an appeal was made to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Tokyo to bring pressure to bear on the Netherlands Governmentto allow larger quantities of rubber to be sent to Japan. Finally, the japanese ambassador, in conversation with Mr. R. A. Butler on the 30th May, endeavoured to adopt the attitude that our economic policy towards Japan was vindictiveand that our future relations could not. hope to improve.12. These complaints, coupled with the threatening attitude of the Japanesepress to the Netherlands East Indies, make it legitimate to assume that our policyover the past eight months has begun to bear fruit. The Japanese are, it maybe hoped, finding it more and more difficult to avoid drawing on their reserves.In every part of the world they are meeting with obstruction ultimately causedeither by British or United States action. In British and Allied territoriesdirect embargoes or restrictions are imposed; in the United States licences are usually refused altogether; in Latin America the Japanese find a comprehensivepolicy of United States and United Kingdom purchases of the more importantwar materials; in Thailand they find us doing what we can to baulk their plans.By their control of Indo-China and by their pressure on Thailand they havecountered our efforts to restrict supplies of rubber and tin; but they have had to share their loot with Germany and are not satisfied with the position. While itwould be foolish to claim that they are as yet seriously weakened, it would be equally foolish, to deny that they are becoming increasingly alarmed.Ministry of Economic Warfare.
