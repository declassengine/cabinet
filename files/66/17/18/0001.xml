(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT);W.P. ,(LI)^Qth June,V7AR   CABINET..RUSSIA.DENIAL OP OIL TO THE ENEMY.MemoranduiTi by the Minister of economic warfare.If the Hun push reaches the Caucasus, thedestruction of the oilfields will be of vital importanceto us.    In this job the help of Russian experts will be most valuable,  if not absolutely essential.      But theRussians may hesitate to paralyse the whole Sovieteconomy;, and Sir Stafford Cripps told me that an offer by His Majesty&apos;s Government to make good the loss latermight be decisive in obtaining Russian consent.    probably the most acceptable offer would be the replacement afterthe war of some of the equipment destroyed and an under-taking to do all we can to supply oil to Russia onfavourable terms not only after but during the war.I,  therefore,  ask my colleagues to agree that sir Stafford Cripps should be authorised at once todiscuss this question with the Russians and to reportwhat offer,  in his judgment,  should be made to them.H.D.Ministry of Economic Warfare,30th June, lgiil.
