 lbENCLOSURE      I.LETTER FROM SIR JOHN WARDLAl/Y-MILNE TO TliE PR BE MINISTER.DATED 31ST JUNE,  1941.Dear Prime Minister,As it may be a few days before any communicationreaches you from the Select Committee on NationalExpenditurej I think it may be desirable to put on record the points I tried to bring before you as a result of theenquiry you made of me.We are definitely of opinion that the country isnot getting the production that it should do and that ispossible with the labour supply available.      In view ofthe increased number of people in industry and the new.. .factories coming into operation there is,  and will- be an increasing output, but we very much doubt whether enquiry would not show that the acual production per man, per day,is not falling.      The bulk of the people are working well,but there is a distinct element, particularly among the younrpeople, men especially,  which is not pulling its weight.These people are responsible mainly for the complaints ofslack work and absenteeism, although it is also plain, thatabsenteeism is caused by other factors, such as can beand are being increasingly dealt with by improved transport facilities and by the work of Welfare Officers0The Essential Works Order is not working well.      It iffar too cumbrous in its machinery to begin with and is really only being applied on the one side, in favour of theworkers.     The position of the employer is almost hopeless;he has lost control of his labour, discipline has largely-disappeared and the remedies are impracticable in their operation.     Both employers and Trades Unions have stressesthe necessity for a much speedier method of dealing withthe few delinquents who lower the whole tone of theestablishment,     We do not believe that the attacks madeon the employers as a whole are justified;    there may becases in which action against them is necessary, but, if so, the Ministry of Labour- has the power and should exerciseit impartially against both employers and employed.     Atpresent it is not doing so.There are various other matters which I hope we shallbe able to put before you quite shortly, but these werethe principal points I think that I was able to make inour short inter-view the other day, and it may be useful toyou to have them on record.Yours sincerely,(Sgd)  J.UARDLAW-MILN

LETTER FROM MR.  ERNEST BEVIN TO THE PRIME MINISTER.DATED 27TH JUNE, 1941.&quot; &apos;Dear Prime Minister,You asked me to advise on the reply to Wardlaw-Milne&apos;letter of 21st June, which I return herewith.You will not need to be told that nothing should besaid to him which could be construed as an attempt to influence the lines of the Committee&apos;s report.     But I think you might properly observe that in view of the gravity ofthe conclusions suggested in his letter you assume thatthe Committee have not reached them without obtaining andverifying a sufficient quantity of evidence, that asregards the rate of output they have detailed faots and figures on which they can rely,  and that their remarksabout the effect of the Essential Work Order, during the -short period for which it has so far been operative, are justified by adequate investigation, including evidence fromthis Ministry.For your own information I may say that the highreputation of the Committee - hitherto not undeserved -will not deter me from challenging a Report which is notbased on fact, or which distorts the facts by placing them out of their true perspective.The campaign on &quot;absenteeism&quot; in the Press and elsewhere has done a great deal of harm because it isregarded as pillorying the workers unfairly for weaknesseswhich in the main are due to other factors and other people,with the result that it is much more difficult for theworkers&apos; representatives to co-operate in measures designedto remedy the small number of cases in which the workers are really to blame.     The test of the value of theCommittee1s Report on this subject will be whether it putsthis aspect in the right perspective.     If other things are put right slackness and absenteeism will be easilyhandled;    if they are not, an attack on slackness andabsenteeism will be of no avail and will merely cause addedbitterness.Wardlaw-Milne&apos;s references to the Essential WorkOrder seem clearly to be based on inadequate information.The statement that the Order is &quot;really only being appliedon the one side, in favour of the workers&quot; and that &quot;theposition of the employer is almost hopeless&quot; is justnonsense.      The main object and effect of the .Order is to deprive the worker of freedom to leave.      It equallyrestricts the right of the employer to discharge, exceptfor serious misconduct,    but since the last thing employers &apos;..ant to do nowadays is to discharge their workers this-restriction does not amount to much,    The remarks madeby Wardlaw-Milne reflect the views of a certain class ofemployers - some of whom have contributed largely to ourpresent difficulties by their own undisciplined behaviour -who think the worker ought to be tied up without anycorresponding restriction on the employer.    This attitude is not shared by the organised employers who recognisethat such restrictions cannot be one-sided and that the worker must be properly safeguarded against arbitrary action by the employer.    The alternative to the Order is not to deprive the worker of his safeguards but to restore hisfreedom.  fit\c\ -oii-mcre industry back into chaos-

The statement that the employer &quot;has lost control ofhis labour, discipline has largely disappeared and the remedies are    impracticable in their operation&quot;  is a wildand recku.ess exaggeration,,    There are no doubt some difficulties of this kind, they existed tfcefore theinstitution of the Essential Work Order, and though they may possibly have increased in the few weeks for which that order has so far been in operation I know ot no statisticalevidence to this effects    It is true enough that theprocedure for handling cases of alleged delinquency is slowin operation and appears to be cumbrous.    So it v/as beforethe Order wasappplied and so I think it must to someextent remain, though I am at this moment discussing with theemployers and trade unions ho?/ the procedure can be effectivelyimproved.    We must have powers of punishment in reserve, butif our object is to increase production rather than topunish the delinquent worker we shall only be successful Ifwe can get him to mend his ways, and this is not a thingwhich can be achieved&quot;by prosecution or Ministerial Order,Some figures I have seen   relating to a firm atLeamington throw an interesting light on this subject.    Theyappointed two members of their staff to investigateindividually each case of absenteeism,  certain the cause,and have it handled by the Medical Officer, Welfare officer or otherwise,,    The result was that the percentage loss foilfrom 9% (of which 2-g% was due to sickness) on 20th November,1940., to 5% (of which 2$ was due to sickness) on 1st June,.L941oI note that Wardlaw-Milne states that this Ministrydoes not exercise Its powers impartially against both employers and employed.    This is a grave allegation, whichI repudiate absolutely, and unless it can be justified bysome evidence which will stand the test of investigation the-act that such an allegation can be made is proof of apartisan attitude of mind.Yours sincerely,(Sgd)      ERNEST BEVIN.

ENCLOSURE. III.LETTER FROM SIR JOHN WARDLAW-MILNE TO THE PRIMEMINISTER. DATED 5RD JULY. 1941,Dear Prime Minister,In my letter to you of the 21st June I &quot;brieflyset out the views of the Select Committee on-national expenditure on two matters which had formed the subjectof our last conversation:(a) that output was below what should be expected from the labour force now employed;(b) that certain features of the Essential WorkOrder were unsatisfactory;and indicated that additional points v/ould be submittedshortly.Our intention had been to address to you amemorandum for the consideration of the War Cabinet, inadvance of the detailed report on labour questions whichthe Select Committee hope to make to the House in the courseof the next month or so;   but on further consideration Itwas decided that the essential matters could as well be embodied in a personal letter.The further points are four:-(l) The Essentral Work Order.Employers and workers alike both assertthat the procedure which the Order provides fordealing with such cases as allegations ofdeliberate absenteeism., bad time-keeping, etc,which may lead to suspension or dismissal, requiresmodification so that such cases may be decidedexpedi tiously and directly by q local tribunal,,We recommend that the   Order should be modified and adapted in accordance with the viewsof Trade Union leaders and employers0(2) De-reservation.A number of witnesses have strongly urged, and we agree with them,  that the general principle- to be applied should be &quot;work or fight&quot; ;and that de-reservation should be the naturalalternative for those who are not prepared to makethe best use of the special skill for which their services were reserved.( 3) South Wales and Bris tol^Channe 1 Boilermajcers :The notorious case of Mr. Ja Jones, theBoilermakers1  delegate in this area, has beenforcibly brought to the separate attention ofthree of our Sub-Committees by a number ofdifferent witnesses; and it has been madeabundantly plain(a) that his activities are a serious menace to the war effort in his district;(b)that no effective action to curtail these activities has been takens and, whenflouted it with impunity0

It is unecessary to categorise the severecriticisms that have been levelled at Mr* Jonesby other Trade Unionists, employers and departmental and Service officers, since thefacts are well and widely known,    A summary ofthe complaints made to us could be submittedif required-We consider it essential that this man1sinfluence should be removed,,(4) Propaganda,This is not a matter in which theSelect Committee have any direct interest, but our evidence goes to show that the output ofwork, to some extent, is affected by the apparentcontradictions in educative publicity in works and shops*    Propaganda which similtaneouslypresses the worker to&quot;go to it&quot; and describeshim as doing a wonderful job of work does not help;    neither is it of value in achieving asolution of the important problem of providingadequate transport, housing and canteens forblame to be laid publicly for these deficienciesupon employers, when s everal of the bad oases that-have come to the Select Committee1s noticerelate to factories under direct government control and management.Yours sincerely,(Sgd)    Ja WARDLAW-MILNE *

221h w iENCLOSURE  IV.LETTER PROM MR.  ERNEST BEVIN TO PRIME minister dated 9TH JULY,  1941.&quot;       &apos; &apos;Dear Prime Minister,You ask for my answers on the points made inWardlaw-Milne&apos; s letter to you of the 3rd July5  returnedherewith.    I will deal with the four points,  as theyaffect this Department,  in order:-(l)    Essential Work Order.,,      The proposal is to set uplocal tribunals to deal with deliberate absenteeism,bacl time-keeping etc.Munitions Tribunals were tried in the last war andthey were a failure.      Large numbers of disputes occurred in spite of them.I preferred to rely,  in the first instance,  ondiscipline being dealt with through the Works Committees,and after consultation with many of the best employers,where absenteeism is low and management is good,  I adhere to that policy.      if it fails, the National ServiceOfficer can issue a direction to the workman,  subject tothe workman&apos;s right of appeal to a Local Appeal Board,and if all this fails, the workman can be prosecuted inthe Courts.While this procedure does&apos; not appear on paper to beso expeditious as bringing a man before a local Tribunal,I think it is likely to prove more effective in achievinguseful results, and in maintaining the responsibility ofthe management and the man s fellow workmen in dealingwith cases of discipline.It must be remembered that the Order has not beenin operation very long.&apos;     Indeed,  in some industries it has only just been applied,I suppose the Committee&apos;s idea is that this problem can be got over by the more inflicting of fines,but having had experience of the Munition Tribunalspreviously I can assure you mere fining is no deterrent9Wardlaw-Milne says that the institution of suchTribunals is asked for by the Trade Union leaders and employers.      I have had no definite proposal of such a character put before me.      It is true that they have been mentioned in passing and I should be glad to have advioefrom Wardlaw-Milne of what Unions have suggested it and where.      In any event,  I should need a good deal ofconvincing before I could agree to the change.I may say that I have on my own initiativeproposed amendments to the Order as the result of experience.     They have been discussed and will be readyto issue  in a few days.      One of the points of the amendments is to give the employer a limited power of suspension,  and I an advised if this is added to theOrder it will remove i..ost of the difficulties-.

(2)      De-reservation.      I have raised this with the consultative Committee,.    The trade unions offered the mostviolent objection on principle;    the employers supported -it,  and I am at present considering whether to go aheadnotwithstanding this difference of opinion.I am certain that if this matter is raised in areport from the Committee it will raise a first classpolitical controversy and hamper the handling of theproblem..The Services,  too, have their own views aboutbeing compelled to find room for industrial delinquents,(3)      South Wales and Bristol Channel Boilermakers,     Wehave had difficulty with the representative of the Boiler-makers&apos; Union in South Wales and, as you know, we are having further investigations made at the present moment,but it would also be as well to keep in mind that he hasgreat support from the men in that area and if theCommittee recommends he should be removed, it will enhancehis reputation.      It would be interesting to know how theCommittee propose it should be done..    In my view such a recommendation would have the effect of putting him on apedestal which he would be clever enough to take full advantage, of.    He has done nothing,  as far as I know, thatwould offer a ground for prosecution.    Further circumstances-stances have arisen down there about which I am enquiringfor the facts.      I have sent a representative from hereto investigate today and I propose on that report to take it up with his Executive.One very serious matter arises, however, with theCommittee,  as to whether they have invited Mr. Jones to appear before them and answer the charges referred to inWardlaw-Milne&apos;s letter.    If a Public Committee of this character condemns a man unheard,  it might well cause avery serious political and Industrial storm in South Wales.(4)      Propaganda. This paragraph makes vague complaintswithout suggesting anything positive that might be done.I do not see why propaganda should not be effective if itcongratulates workers on doing work and simultaneously .incites them to do better.      I rather suspect that the paragraph is mainly designed to&quot; lead up to the innuendoin the concluding words about the absurdity of lajrbigany blame on employersiWhen I was in the North of England last weekend, -employers made bitter complaints of whispering campaignswhich were libelling both workers and employers - asystem of anonymous letters, of which I think you have hadsamples - which have been running partially as a Pressstunt and partially,  it looked to me like, Fifth Column   1activity.   &quot;  I was asked by leading representatives of theemployers if I would publicly make reference to the matterand denounce it and after investigating the whole of thecircumstances and seeing a good deal of the type of letter,I did so.    I may say too that I had talks with therepresentatives of the Production Departments and they were very perturbed about this campaign of unsettlement thatwas going on and about which there was no foundation infact at all,I am afraid that the suggested report of theCommittee, unless they have tested their facts very carefully and judiciously, might give support to the severy disturbing tactics, YouPs sincereiyy-7^.
