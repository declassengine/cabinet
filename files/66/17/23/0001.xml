THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War\Cabinet.   July 1941.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (41) 150.July 3, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.29CO-OPERATION WITH THE NETHERLANDS government regarding MUTUAL SUPPORT IN THE EVENT OF japanese aggression.Memorandum by the Secretary o,f State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 15th May the Defence Committee (Operations) approved a proposal made in a memorandum which I circulated to the War Cabinet on the 12th May(W.P. (41) 101), that, subject to the concurrence of the Dominion governments and to the prior information of the United States Government, I should make apublic declaration on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government responding to a broad-cast made by the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs in the netherlands east Indies on the 6th May. The proposed declaration would welcome the deter-mination of the Netherlands East Indies to resist attack and would emphasise that we also have no aggressive intentions, but have an interest in any movementlikely to prejudice the security of the line which runs from Malaya to NewZealand through the Netherlands East Indies, and agree that any attack on anypart of that line equally concerns all affected parties and must be dealt with as anattack on the whole line.2. Consultations took place with the Dominion Governments and HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Washington and Tokyo. 1 need not trouble mycolleagues with a full summary of these. It is now clear that, in view of the changed situation, and especially the breakdown of the Japanese negotiations in the Netherlands East Indies, either a public declaration or representations tothe Japanese Government would be inopportune.3. The question whether assurances of any kind should be exchanged between ourselves and the Dutch has, however, now been presented in anotherform. In a Note dated the 12th June (Annex I) the Netherlands Governmenthave officially informed His Majesty&apos;s Government of their readiness to&quot; ratify &quot; the proceedings of the Singapore Conferences held in February and april last and have enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government, on their side,are prepared to &quot; ratify.&quot; The Netherlands Government have drawn particular attention to what they call the &quot; political clauses &quot; of the recommendations ofthese conferences, and have declared their willingness to &quot; ratify &quot; these clausesseparately, if desired.4. The so-called &quot; political clauses &apos;&apos; are presumably those embodied inparagraphs 6, 26 and 27 of the American-Dutch-British Conference of April 1941.The telegraphic summary of these paragraphs is attached as Annex II. Briefly,they stress the importance of mutual support and immediate collective counter-action if the Japanese take any one of a specified list of military measures, which11423   [22681]
constitute either an attack or a really imminent threat of attack on the possessionsof the Powers concerned. In paragraph 27 the conference recommended that steps should be taken to evolve a satisfactory procedure to ensure an immediate decision on counter-measures in any of the circumstances contemplated.5. The term ratification, as applied to these staff conversations, is perhapsrather misleading. But the Dutch request faces His Majesty&apos;s Government withthe necessity of deciding whether they should formally approve the reports of the singapore Conference, with their political implications, and so inform the Nether-lands Government, or not. The Departments concerned are trying to work outthe most rapid means of communication for securing immediate decisions oncounter-measures against Japanese attack (paragraph 27 of Singapore Report).This cannot, however, be effectively done without consultation with the Dutch,and, in general, it is hardly possible to continue to work on the basis of the reportuntil we have decided that its political implications have been accepted.6. I would suggest that, if the most effective possible preparations are to bemade, the approval of the reports should be sanctioned. In informing theNetherlands Government of this decision, a statement as regards the politicalclauses might, subject to the agreement of the Dominion Governments, be madeto the following effect : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s-Government in the United Kingdom, having consideredthe recommendations contained in the reports of the Anglo-Dutch-australian and American-Dutch-British Conferences held in Singapore in February and april 1941 respectively, give their general approval to these recommendations as the basis for the preparation of future plans. As regards the proposals in paragraphs 6, 26 and 27 of the Conference of April 1941, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom are prepared to join with the otherGovernments concerned in a reciprocal agreement to co-operate to the full extent of their available resources in the event of any one of them being forced to take military action to counter armed action by Japanese forces against its territory or mandated territory. They are prepared to regardsuch an agreement as binding on themselves vis-a-vis the Netherlands Govern-ment when it has been accepted by that Government and the Governmentsof Australia and New Zealand. They do not think it possible to agree thatarmed action should automatically be taken in the eventualities memionedin sub-paragraphs (b) to (e) of paragraph 26 of the said report, but they areprepared to agree that such Japanese movements should be the subject of most immediate consultation between the Governments concerned.&quot;As regards paragraph 27 of that report, His Majesty&apos;s government agree that a procedure should be worked out to facilitate urgent consultation between the Governments concerned. They are themselves taking steps toimprove the machinery in this respect, and propose to ask for theco-operation of the Netherlands Government in this matter.&quot;A. E.Foreign Office, July 3. 1941.ANNEX I.Mr. Eden to Sir N. Bland.(No. 23.).Sir, Foreign Office, June 13, 1941.-THE Netherlands Minister came to see me this morning, when he handedme the enclosed memorandum from his Government on the subject of ratifying the agreement reached as a result of staff talks held at Singapore last Februarybetween the British, Australian and Netherlands fighting services. The ministers aid that he wished to make it clear that, while the view of his Government wasthat it would be all to the good if the participants ratified the agreement and informed the United States of their action, his Government had decided not toinfoirn the United States of their view unless and until we shared that view.
4 i CEnclosure.The Netherlands Minister to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. (Communicated June 13.)(No. 1731.  Secret.)Your Excellency, London, June 12, 1941.I HAVE the honour, under instructions received, to inform your Excellencythat Her Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to ratify the agreement reached on the 25th February, 1941, as result of the staff talks held at Singaporebetween representatives of the British, Australian (also representing NewZealand) and Netherlands fighting services.Your Excellency will, no doubt, be aware that the agreement, besides essentialpolitical clauses, contains many strategical and technical recommendations,which although constituting an integral part of the whole might not lend them-selves for formal ratification. If the British Government share this opinion, her majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to limit the ratification to the politicalclauses and to the clauses relating to the strategical command. A general declara-tion which, as stated above, would form an integral part of the agreement concerning all strategical and technical dispositions of the staff talks, could atthe. same time be made by the respective Governments. This declaration mightwell, in the opinion of the Netherlands Government, cover at the same time theresult of the Netherlands-British talks held at Singapore after the 26th april and provide for a general acceptance of future modifications of a technical and non-political nature agreed upon by the respective staffs.I may point out, however, that my Government, if the British Governmenthold another opinion, are quite prepared to ratify the complete protocol of thestaff talks held from the 22nd to 25th February, as drafted by the respectiverepresentatives at Singapore.The staff talks from the 22nd to 25th February have been followed andcomplemented by the staff talks between the same parties and United states representatives held between the 21st and 26th April.My Government have instructed me to inform your Excellency that they arealso prepared to ratify the agreement reached upon the latter talks at Singapore.If the British Government are prepared to do likewise; it is suggested toSB2. I asked the Minister whether he contemplated that ratification should bemade public. M. Michiels van Verduynen replied : No. 1 continued that I hadsupposed this to be the view of the Netherlands Government, but I thought that,apart from the merits of the case, such a course might present serious difficulties for us. It was certainly not our general practice to ratify any document which included a political commitment without informing Parliament. While warcompelled many exceptions to be made, this was a principle of the conduct of our international affairs to which I was much attached, and it would be necessaryfor us to look into the matter from this angle. The Minister said he quiteunderstood this, though he had thought that war conditions might have made it possible to depart from the usual practice. His Government were of course in adifferent position, since they had no Parliament to whom they could report. if on enquiry I found that the position was as I had stated it, he would then saythat that was a good reason why they could not ratify. I undertook to look into the matter and to speak to the Minister again.. 3. We then had some conversation about the situation in the Far East,and I asked M. Michiels van Verduynen what was his view of the breakdown ofeconomic negotiations between the Netherlands East Indies and Japan. TheMinister replied that he did not view the situation tragically, and did not believethat the Japanese would be so foolish as to embark on military action just now.He regarded their attitude as mainly bluff, and was confirmed in this by the publicity they had given to the joint meetings of their staffs following the breakdown of the negotiations. He had been through these negotiations fromthe start to the finish, and he was certain that the Netherlands East Indies had done all in their power to meet the Japanese wishes.I am. &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN.
inform the Government of the United States of America that the British and theNetherlands Governments are prepared to ratify both agreements.The proposal tending to limit the ratification to the main clauses and to ageneral declaration applies also to the latter agreement.xxS 800H ciS cl favourable reply as to the proposed ratification is received from your Excellency, the necessary instructions will be sent to the Government of theNetherlands East Indies. I will then not fail to acquaint your Excellency withthe contents of these instructions.I have, &amp;c.E.

Collective military strength of Associated Powers can only be developedfully if Governments agree to act together should any judge that action which necessitated active military counter-action has been taken by Japanese. Any of following actions by Japan regarded as creating position in which failure totake active military counter-action would place us at such military disadvantageshould Japan subsequently attack that we should then advise our respective governments to authorise such action : (a) A direct act of war by Japanese armed forces against the territory ormandated territory of any of the Associated Powers. It is not possibleto define accurately what would constitute &quot; a direct act of war.&quot; Itis possible for a minor incident to occur which, although technicallyan act of war, could be resolved by diplomatic action. It is recognisedthat the decision as to whether such an incident is an act of war mustlie with the Government concerned.(b) The movement of the Japanese forces into any part of Thailand to thewest of 100 degrees east or to the south of 10 degrees north.(c) The movement of a large number of Japanese warships or of a convoy of merchant ships escorted by Japanese warships, which, from its position and course, was clearly directed upon the Philippine Islands,the east coast of the Isthmus of Kra or the east coast of Malaya, orbad crossed the parallel of 6 degrees north between Malaya and the philippines, a line from the Gulf of Davao to Waigeo Island, or theEquator east of Waigeo.(d) The movement of Japanese forces into Portuguese Timor.(e) The movement of Japanese forces into New Caledonia or the Loyalty Is.    .)27.
