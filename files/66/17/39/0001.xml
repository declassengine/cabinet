NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1,   Our shipping losses have again been light.   Destructive raids by-our aircraft have caused serious casualties to enemy shipping.An Italian U-boat has been sunk in the Mediterranean.Enemy minelaying in the Suez Canal has increased.Home Waters.2. Between the 7ih and 9th July H.M. Submarine Sealion sank two tunnyboats by gunfire west of the Gironde and a steam trawler west of the Loire.H.M.S. Royal Sovereign has returned to home waters after refitting inAmerica.H.M.S. Prince Philippe (special service vessel) wTas sunk in collision off thecoast of Wigtownshire.   186 survivors were rescued.H.M. Corvette Arbutus was damaged in collision off the west of Ireland,and minor damage has occurred to H.M.S. Franklin (survey ship) and HALS.Vienna (M.T.B. depot ship) off the East coast.At Portland two M.G.Bs. were destroyed by fire after an explosion, thecause of which is unknown.During the week approximately 155,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or seriously damaged by aircraft of the Coastal and Bomber Commands.Details are given in the Air Section.North Atlantic.3. On the 15th HALS. Lady Somers (Ocean Boarding Vessel) was torpedoed,while on patrol, 250 miles east of the Azores. A Spanish tanker has picked up138 survivors.H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Aurania, while on escort duty, struck aniceberg in thick weather at the entrance of the Belle Isle Straits (west of new foundland) and damaged her bows.South Atlantic.4. H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Canton, about 300 miles north-west of st. Paul&apos;s Rocks, intercepted the German s.s. Hermes (7,209 tons), which scuttledherself on Canton opening fire.   Three boatloads of survivors were rescued.Mediterranean.5. On the 11th July H.M. Destroyer Defender was damaged by bombs30 miles east of Bardia and subsequently sank.HM. Submarine Torbay sank the Italian tanker Strombo (5,232 tons) in theZea Channel, east of the Gulf of Athens. She also reports having sunk anothertanker, a merchantman, two schooners and five caiques full of soldiers.HM. Submarine P. 33 attacked a north-bound convoy of five merchant ships off the coast of Tunis, and claimed two hits on one of the larger ships.During the week Blenheim aircraft have sunk 15,000 tons of shipping and damaged a number of other ships, details of which are given in the Air Section.Naval aircraft from Malta torpedoed a 6,000-ton tanker off Tripoli (L.).In the period under review ten French merchant ships (upwards of 26,000tons) eastward, and three (3,833 tons) westward have passed Gibraltar underescort.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. In Home Waters two attacks on U-Boats have been carried out duringthe week without visible results.In the Mediterranean H.M. Submarine Torbay sank a U-Boat off MykoniIsland in the Greek Archipelago.
Enemy Intelligence.7. There have been no changes in the positions of the larger surface unitsduring the week.U-Boats.8. During the week twenty or more German U-Boats have been operating inthe North-Western Approaches and three in the Freetown area. Five Italianshave been in the Azores-Madeira-Cape Verde area.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. According to the information at present available, shipping casualties during the week under review have again been well below the average. Two ships were damaged during a bombing attack on Port Said, and the s.s. Georgic(27,759 tons) was set on fire at Suez and is likely to become a total loss. One ship was torpedoed in the Azores area and another on passage from Iceland (C) to canada, but no ships in convoy have been reported lost by U-Boat action. Therehave been a number of bombing attacks around the coast and off the Faroes; two ships have been sunk and four damaged. One ship was mined in the thames estuary.10. The shipping losses in June (details of which are given in Appendix I)were 76 ships and 4 small craft, totalling 335,596 tons, of which 51 ships and1 small craft (230,239 tons) were British. This total is 125,635 tons lower thanthe previous month, and the British tonnage lost is the lowest since January thisyear. Forty-seven ships and one small craft (259,876 tons) were sunk by U-Boats,twenty-four ships and three small craft (66,318 tons) by aircraft, four ships(4,640 tons) by mine and one (4,762 tons) by raider. Seventy-four per cent, of the losses by U-Boat occurred in the North Atlantic and Western Approaches, andtwenty-five per cent, in the Freetown area. In Maj^ the figures were forty-two percent, in the North-Western Approaches and fifty-eight per cent, in theFreetown area.In addition, 18 ships totalling 87,510 tons, which are included in Appendix I,were reported in June but lost in previous months.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 16th July 875 ships, including 146 allied and 20 neutral, were convoyed. Ten armed merchant cruisers, five anti-aircraftships, seventy-one destroyers and one hundred and two sloops, minesweepers and corvettes were employed on escort duties. 4,190 ships in 16 convoys arrivedduring June and, of these, 29 ships (119,573 tons) from 3 of the convoys were lost by enemy action. Since the beginning of the Avar 72,145 ships have beenconvoyed, of which 360 have been lost.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the12th July amounted to 1,147,564 tons, compared with 659,952 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 912,425 tons during the past ten weeks.This is the highest figure since the week ending the 24th August, 1940. oil imports in 38 tankers amounted to 403,751 tons; mineral imports were 225,552tons, of which 127,983 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Timberimports were 63,041 tons and cereals 212,833 tons. Other food imports totalled151,732 tons, which included : sugar 71,513 tons, refrigerated and tinned meats,,bacon and hams 29,588 tons, fruit (mainly currants and sultanas) 17,943 tons,cheese 3,839 tons, cocoa 2,699 tons. Tobacco imports were 724 tons. Largequantities of machinery included 1,411 tons of machine tools, and arrivals of aircraft, ammunition and war stores were also well above average.British Minelaying.12. Only one minelaying operation by surface craft has been carried outin the period under review, when H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 320 mines in the faroes-Iceland (C) Channel on the 16th July.Minelaying by aircraft has been on a small scale during the week and hasbeen confined to French Biscay ports and the Frisian coast.[22728] b
Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.13. The centre of minelaying raids by enemy aircraft this week has been the humber area, the raids on some nights extending as far north as the Tyne andBlyth and as far south as Yarmouth.Forty-four acoustic and 9 magnetic mines have been exploded in home waters during the week. The mine totals to date are : magnetic 1,287, acoustic899, contact 934.The Farn Islands inshore channel is closed.foreign Waters.14. The Suez Canal has been raided four times during the week. Early on the10th July a few mines were dropped in the southern end of the Canal betweeneight and twelve miles from Port Tewfik. On the night of the 11th/12th July afew were scattered along the Canal and others were dropped at Port Said near the seaward end of the Eastern Breakwater. Early on the 14th July several mines were reported in the Southern entrance to the Canal. Various sections of the canal were closed, but through traffic was resumed again on the 15th July. Thefollowing night fifteen aircraft again raided the Canal, but did little damage.Some unexploded mines are suspected, but outside the dredged channel.During an air raid on Gibraltar on the night of the 11th/12th July para-chute mines were dropped and the Mole has been declared dangerous to shipping.Two dangerous areas have been declared off Haifa, Palestine, and one offZambra Island in the north-east part of the Gulf of Tunis.The port of Takoradi is again closed.  Famagusta in Cyprus is also closed.Enemy Merchant Shipping.-&apos; 15. It has been reported that between the 1st and 15th June eight Norwegian,ships, totalling some 20,000 tons, were loading ore at Kirkenes. The Dresden(5,567 tons), which sailed from Brazil on the 28th March, has arrived at st.. Jean-de-Luz. She had on board prisoners from the Egyptian Zamzam(8.299 tons), which was sunk by a raider in the south Atlantic.The R. C. Rickmers (5,198 tons) has been renamed the Teifuku Maru and leftKobe on the 14th Jury- A reliable report from Tokyo received on the 13th Julystated that there were seven German ships in Yokohama.MILITARY SITUATION,Russo-German Campaign.16. During the past week advances have been made by German forces on allfronts in varying degree, with the exception of Finland and the Rogachev areaof the White Russian front.Most progress has been made on the Baltic front, where German forces are advancing on Tallinn and are operating in the area east of Lake Peipus inthe direction of Leningrad. The main thrusts have progressed in all sectors,except at Rogachev, where German progress has been impeded by strong Sovietresistance and counter attacks.Finland.17. From all reports it seems that no major Finnish or German offensivehas yet developed in any area. No progress has been made by German forcestowards Murmansk and Kandalaksha. Fighting has continued on the whole front,but little progress has been made anywhere. There has been considerableartillery activity at Hango, but Finnish attacks in this area appear to have madelittle headway.Baltic Front.18. In the Baltic States German forces are advancing northwards to theGulf of Finland. To the east of Lake Peipus considerable progress has beenmade, in the face of stiff resistance by Soviet forces, along the general line of thePskov-Leningrad railway.
White Russia.19. On this front the main effort seems to have been concentrated in thearea Vitebsk-Orsha, and there are indications of an enveloping movement uponSmolensk. South of Orsha, considerable Soviet resistance is being encounteredon the line of the Dnieper, especially at Rogachev, which has been retaken by soviet forces.      -Ukraine.20. Detachments of German armoured formations have made considerable progress, and are reported to be approaching Kiev. They do not, however, appearto have succeeded so far in consolidating their gains, and fighting still continuesas far west as Novograd-Volynsk. No further reports have been received ofthe German advance south-eastwards from Tarnopol, mentioned in last week&apos;resume, so that the Dniester fortifications do not appear so far to have beenturned.Bessarabia.21. German-Roumanian forces have made some progress, but are meeting with stiff resistance by Soviet forces in their attempt to reach-the line of theRiver Dniester.Conclusions.22. It was reported from several sources that the Germans expected toreach Moscow in about three weeks and to have full control of Western Russia,in six or eight weeks. They seem to have been surprised by the degree of Sovietresistance, and to be disturbed by their own heavy losses in men and materials.The fact that they have recently emphasised in their newspapers and in broadcaststhe difficulties of the campaign indicates that they are preparing the populationfor a slower advance and heavier casualties. It will, however, be noted that, forall the slowing up of the advance, it still continues.Operations.Libya and Egypt.23. Active patrolling has been carried out by both sides in the vicinity of tobruk and in the frontier area. The most noteworthy incident was a successfulraid by a patrol from the Tobruk Garrison on the 12th July with the object ofinflicting casualties and securing identifications. Over 50 casualties were inflicted on the enemy and 5 prisoners were taken with a loss to the patrol of only 10 menwounded and 3 missing.The enemy has continued to shell the area of Tobruk harbour and there havebeen several air raids, but little damage has been caused. One enemy aircraft was shot down during a raid on Tobruk on the 14th July.The Italian Command is showing a certain nervousness about the possibilityof landings or descents in .the rear areas. Fortifications are reported in EasternCyrenaica and defensive measures in Tripolitania.Abyssinia.24. Operations are proceeding in the Gondar area, although bad weather and demolitions on the road Debra Tabor-Gondar have rendered progress slow.An isolated party of enemy, 30 miles East of Sardo on the Dessye-Assabroad, are reported to have asked for terms of surrender.Syria.25. On the 10th July our operations in Syria were being continued with allvigour. On the coast our advanced troops were making good progress North ofDamour towards Beirut. A column had advanced up the Euphrates as far asRaqqa. A further column had reached the Turkish frontier at Kamishlie in theNorth-East corner of Syria. British troops from Palmyra had made contact with indian troops at Sukhne, half-way between Palmyra and Deir-ez-Zor. GeneralDentz cabled General Auchinleck that he was prepared to negotiate for the cessation of hostilities, and he proposed that these should be suspended as from&apos;   [22728] b 2
21-01 hours the 11th July. Negotiations proceeded satisfactorily and an agree-ment was initialled by General Dentz&apos;s representative, General de Verdillac.After reference to Vichy and further discussion, the final Convention for cessation of hostilities was signed at 17-00 hours G.M.T., the 14th July, 1941.Intelligence.Italy.26. The present first-line strength of the Italian army is estimated at,200,000 men (78 divisions, including Frontier Guard). In addition the 1921and 1922 classes, with a maximum of 550,000 men, are now under training; the1922 class has been called up before its time, and the 1923 class is registered for service.Spain.27. It has now been confirmed that General Munoz Grande, who at onetime was Secretary-General of the Falange, has been appointed commander of&apos;the Spanish Volunteer Forces to fight in Russia.The total strength of the forces to be sent is not expected to exceed 20,000;they will be armed, equipped and trained in Germany.The number of genuine volunteers is problematical.Hungary.-28. According to the Italian press, the Hungarians began military opera-tions on the 27th June, on a 200-km. front in the Carpathians against well-prepared defensive positions. No reliable reports of the fighting have, however,been received, and the present position is obscure.Rcmmania.29. Reports of Russian air raids show that serious damage has been caused to house property in Constantsa, where a munitions train was also destroyed.Damage to the port area is severe, but is due more to naval than to aerial bombardment. The destruction of the railway stations at Galatz and Sulina isreported.Greek Islands.30. Italian forces about equivalent to a division arrived at Samos earlythis month. Samos appears to be the centre from which these forces will be distributed over the neighbouring Greek Islands of the -aegean.Bulgaria.31. Considerable Bulgarian military activity is taking place in theneighbourhood of the Turkish frontier. In view of the great reduction in thenumbers of German troops in Bulgaria, the Bulgarians themselves are apparentlytaking over the task of defence against Turkey. It is probably these moves that have served as a basis for Tass and other agency reports of an attack by Germanyand Bulgaria on Turkey being launched in the near future.North and West A frica.32. German infiltration is reported to be continuing slowly but steadily,largely through the Spanish zone.Far East.33. Japanese propaganda has been active. The French in Indo-China areaccused of conspiring with the U.S. and ourselves in activities inimical to japanese interests, and of oppressing the &quot; pro-Japanese &quot; population; Britishland forces are said to be concentrating on the Thai frontier in a threateningmanner; and an Anglo-Chinese alliance is said to have been arranged to counterJapan&apos;s southward expansion. &apos;The scene is thus well set for Japan to declare that her &quot; interests &quot; are sothreatened that she must take &quot; protective &quot; action.  Such action would probably
mean the acquisition of strategic bases in Indo-China, and recent reports suggestthat a move of this kind is imminent.There are also signs that preparations are being made for possible actionagainst Soviet forces in the Far East.A ban has been placed on travelling by foreigners in Korea, Manchukuo,Hokkaido and Kyushu, reservists in certain districts in Japan have been called up and there has been some reinforcement of Japanese forces in Sakhalin and in western Manchukuo, opposite the frontier of the Maritime Province.Japan has sufficient forces in the territories bordering the South China Seasto undertake any operations she may contemplate against Indo-China. InManchukuo her forces are at present disposed for defence, but her reserves in japan and Sakhalin would be immediately available for offensive action if theywere so required.Invasion.34. There have been several reports of the presence of gliders at aerodromes in Holland, Belgium and France.AIR SITUATION.General Review.35. The outstanding feature of the week&apos;s air operations was the considerable success which attended our daylight attacks on enemy shipping bothin Home Waters and in the Central Mediterranean. At night the pressure uponindustrial and military targets in Germany was maintained in spite ofunfavourable weather.Enemy activity over our coasts, both by day and night, was on a small scale.Successful attacks were made on Naples and Messina.The enemy carried out air attacks in the Suez Canal area.Germany and Occupied Territory.General.36. Bomber Command despatched 160 sorties by day and 663 by night.Fighter Command continued to carry out offensive sweeps over Northern Franceand flew 93 squadron sorties (1,104 aircraft) during the week.Day.37. Aircraft of Bomber Command, including Stirlings, attackedshipbuilding yards at Le Trait (on the Seine), a ship-lift at Arques, docks at rotterdam, railway centres at Hazebrouck and Cherbourg and other objectives.The majority of these attacks were carried out with good effect and bursts were seen in most target areas. Seven Blenheims and a Stirling were lost. Air gunnersof Bomber Command accounted for two enemy fighters.A series of successful attacks against enemy shipping is reported underCoastal Operations.38. In addition to providing covering escorts for our bombers, a number of offensive sweeps were flown by fighters. Spitfires and Hurricanes succeeded inmaking contact with enemy fighters on several occasions and inflicted casualtiestotalling 35 destroyed, 9 probably destroyed and 25 damaged. Twenty of ourSpitfires failed to return, but three pilots were rescued.39. A marked reduction was noticeable in the enemy&apos;s defensive sorties,only about two-thirds of the previous week&apos;s total effort being reported. On the14th, however, during a three-hour period in which we carried out a sweep, theestimated number of enemy fighter sorties was greater than during any otherperiod of similar duration this month. On this day, we destroyed seven and damaged four enemy aircraft for the loss of four Spitfires.Night.40. Weather throughout the week was unsettled. Operations Averehampered by thundery conditions accompanied by severe icing, much cloud and
thick haze. Primary targets were, in consequence, often difficult to locate andthe full results of our forceful attacks could not be accurately gauged. Flyingunder these conditions, Bomber Command aircraft succeeded, however, in reachingimportant targets and, during the period under review, a total of 683 tons of high-explosive bombs and 51,000 incendiaries were dropped.41. Bremen received, in the course of raids on three nights, 133 tons of high explosive and about 14,500 incendiaries. On the last night weather over the target was clear; extensive fires were started which gave the appearance that thewhole town was ablaze. During an attack, in cloudy weather, on Cologne, 74 tonsof high-explosive bombs and over 6,000 incendiaries were released, resulting innumerous fires, one of which, near a bridge, was especially large. Stirlings andHalifaxes took part, with other bombers, in a raid on Hanover, in which 104 tonsiof high-explosive bombs and 7,000 incendiaries were dropped, one stick of bombsscoring a direct hit on the rubber factory. Bursts were seen on the main station at Wilhelmshaven in the second of two attacks. Duisburg, Rotterdam and hamburg were also attacked during the week.From all these night operations, 18 bombers are missing. A Wellingtondestroyed a Junkers 88.42. Enemy night fighters continued their patrols over Holland and North-West Germany on a scale above the recent average.United Kingdom,43. Fighter Command flew 881 patrols, involving 2.937 sorties by day, and342 patrols, involving 472 sorties by night; this latter total includes dusk anddawn patrols. These figures show a decrease over the previous week, but thebulk of our fighter effort by clay again was accounted for by offensive sweepsand bomber escorts, and by snipping protection patrols. Details of these operations are reported in the appropriate sections.44. Very fewT enemy aircraft crossed our coasts during daylight. our fighters destroyed three enemy bombers and probably destroyed another. One ofthese was shot down by Hurricanes between two convoys off the Welsh Coast;A.A. guns accounted for another raider near Montrose.45. At night, the total of long-range bombers was 175 compared with 340during the previous week. Two small-scale attacks were made on Hull, but apart from these most of the bombing incidents were of a minor nature in coastal areas probably caused by aircraft whose primary objective was shipping.Fighter patrols over this country, which are now one of the most regular features of enemy air activity, were undertaken every night; it is not known that they met with any success. Our night fighters destroyed three enemy aircraft and probably destroyed another.Coastal Operations,46, Coastal Command flew 162 patrols (197 sorties) and provided escortsfor 60 convoys (217 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols carried outby Fighter Command totalled 645 (1,280 sorties).47. Attacks against enemy shipping were particularly successful and thedestruction caused was very great, vessels totalling over 155,000 tons being hit.A number of these ships are known to have been destroyed, and others were damaged so severely that they are likely to be out of service for a considerable time.48. The greater part of these successes was obtained during an attack bythirty-six Blenheims of Bomber Command during the afternoon of the 16th July.These aircraft, for which fighter protection v/as provided on their homeward flight,were despatched against a concentration of shipping at Rotterdam, the majorityof wdiich were vessels of 4,000 tons and upwards, and which had been previouslylocated by air reconnaissance.49. Our bombers proceeded at mast height to the objectives, completesurprise being achieved. A total of seventeen vessels, amounting to 97,000 tons,are claimed as destroyed, while a further five ships, totalling an additional
43,000, were hit and probably severely damaged. The Blenheims passed overRotterdam, where two warehouses and a factory were set alight, so low that one aircraft severed the cable of a derrick. Heavy anti-aircraft fire was encounteredand four of our bombers were lost, two of these having scored direct hits before being shot down.50. On the same day, aircraft of Coastal Command secured hits on a8.000-ton tanker off Boulogne and a 3,500-ton merchant vessel off Ushant, and, onthe 17th, a 3,500-ton ship was set on fire and left down by the stern off the UtyoerLight, Norway. Other successes during the week included an attack from 40 feetby a Hudson which sank a 1,200-ton minesweeper off Ushant with three hits,and the sinking of three vessels, of 1,500, 3,000 and 6,000 tons, off Ijmuiden by aircraft of Bomber Command. Spitfires carried out an attack on a flotilla of motor minesweepers off Berck and all the ships are believed to have been hit.51. A total of 18 aircraft was despatched to lay sea mines off Lorient,St. Nazaire and the Frisian Islands.52. Enemy minelaying on a small scale, involving a total of about 35 air-craft, was carried out on three nights in the Thames Estuary and off the east coast. The activities of enemy long-range bomber and bomber reconnaissanceunits were mainly directed against shipping and attacks were chiefly at night.On the 14th/15th, two attacks were made off the South-West Coast, but all other attacks took place off the East Coasts of England and Scotland.Central Mediterranean.53. Blenheims from Malta, co-operating with Glenn-Martin reconnaissance aircraft, made three highly successful daylight attacks on enemy shipping. Onthe 9th July, six hits were made on four merchant vessels ranging from 7,000 to12,000 tons in Tripoli (L) harbour, one of which was set well alight. Hits were also registered on the mole, and two great fires, followed by a terrific explosion,were the result of an attack on a warehouse. One Blenheim was shot down byA.A. fire and crashed on a torpedo-boat, setting it on fire; three other Blenheimswere missing as a result of enemy fighter action.54. On the same day, four Blenheims attacked a convoy outside the harbour;a vessel of 7,000 tons, believed to be a tanker, was set on fire and claimed to be atotal loss, a three-masted schooner blew up and a merchant vessel of 1,500 tons was hit and left burning fiercely. On the 15th a convoy, consisting of two merchant vessels of 8,000 tons and some smaller ships, escorted by four destroyers,was intercepted proceeding north from Tripoli (L). As a result of an attack by three Blenheims, one of the 8,000-ton merchant vessels was regarded as totallydestroyed, and the other was hit in the bows and damaged.55. Two Blenheims, which attacked Zuara Aerodrome (65 miles west ofTripoli (L)), hit the headquarters building and machine-gunned a concentration of transport aircraft. The barracks at Misurata (120 miles west of Tripoli (L))were also hit.56. A successful night attack by eight Wellingtons, operating from Malta,was made on Naples. Bombs were seen to hit the railway station, warehousesand fuel cisterns; fires were also started in an airframe factory. Another similarattack was made on Messina docks, as a result of which huge fires were started at the ferry railhead, where four lines of goods trucks were left ablaze and furtherextensive fires were observed in the engine sheds; direct hits were also made onthe transformer power plant and among the dockyard warehouses.57. On the 11th July, between 40 and 50 Macchi 200&apos;s raided the island and a few of them carried out a low-flying attack on Luqa aerodrome, as a resultof which one Wellington was destroyed. Hurricanes shot down three of theraiders and damaged four; eleven others were damaged by A.A. fire. Anotherraid on the 17th July resulted in a few bombs being dropped in the dockyardarea and in two further Macchi 200&apos;s being destroyed; one Hurricane is missing.Enemy night attacks were made on five occasions, but apart from some damage to civilian property no important results were obtained.
Egypt and Cyrenaica.58. Benghazi harbour was bombed on four nights by Wellingtons who madea total of forty-five sorties; on each occasion fires were started and satisfactory results recorded. On the night 15th/16th, mines were also dropped. other attacks were made at Derna, where extensive fires were seen, and at Bardia,59. Covering patrols were carried out by fighters over convoys operatingbetween Sidi Barrani and Tobruk. On the 15th July, two formations of enemy aircraft attempted to attack our ships, and Hurricanes which intercepted shot down six Ju 87s, and one Me. 110; two Hurricanes are missing. One lighter inthe convoy was sunk.60. German aircraft made three fairly heavy night attacks on the suez canal area during the week, mines as well as bombs being dropped in each case.Some damage was caused to shipping (as reported in the Naval Section) and two enemy aircraft were shot down. It is now known that during the attack on the night 9th/ 10th July a fire was started on Abu Sueir aerodrome which attractedother raiders with the result that twelve of our fighters and two bombers were destroyed on the ground.Syria and Palestine.61. Blenheims and fighters displayed considerable activity on the 10th July.Bombs were dropped on an ammunition dump at Hamana (near Rayak), resulting in heavy and continuous explosions, and at Talia Camp bombs burst amongst thetents. The road twenty miles to the east of Beirut was hit, and Blenheims andTomahawks, acting in close support of our ground forces, attacked enemy M.T.and.severely damaged 24 vehicles. From these operations four Blenheims were shot down, although some members of the crews are known to have survived;five Dewoitines were destroyed by Tomahawks. Low-flying attacks by fighters were also made on aerodromes at Hama and Talia resulting in 19 Vichy aircraftbeing destroyed or damaged.62. On the following day, bombing attacks were made on the militaryCitadel and Fort at Suweida, and hits were observed. At Mazar Ridge, in theDamascus area, Tomahawks attacked transport vehicles and tanks, three ofwhich were set on fire and twenty more damaged; four gun positions were also successfully attacked. As a result of attacks on enemy aircraft on the groundat Aleppo and Hama, three enemy aircraft were burnt, and fourteen othersmachine-gunned.63. An attack was made on Palmyra aerodrome by nine Dewoitines, andone Lysander was burnt and two other aircraft damaged.64. On the 14th July one S. 79 was attacked by Hurricanes near Haifa andwas probably too badly damaged to have reached its base.65. The losses suffered by the French Air Force in Syria from the 8th june to the cessation of hostilities amounted to 81 aircraft destroyed, 7 probabydestroyed and 81 damaged. There is evidence that on the 11th and 12th July atleast one squadron of fighters was withdrawn from Syria to Rhodes.Dodecanese, Greece, Crete, Cyprus.66. On the night 12th /13th July fifteen Wellingtons from Egypt attacked the Rhodes aerodromes at Kattavia, Calato and Maritza. Fires and explosionsresulted and some dispersed aircraft are believed to have been destroyed. Onthe 14th/15th. thirteen Wellingtons attacked Eleusis and Hassani aerodromes,near Athens, bombs bursting at Eleusis in a hangar and in the dispersal area.Five other Wellingtons attacked Heraklion (Crete) aerodrome.67. On the 12th July unidentified aircraft attacked Nicosia (Cyprus)causing some slight damage to civilian property.
West Africa.68. Information has been received that six torpedo float planes arrived at dakar from North Africa on the 12th July. This is believed to be part of ascheme for further reinforcement of the Dakar area announced by Vichy at thetime of the Syria Armistice.Russia.69. There is little news of air operations. Although the advance of theGerman forces has been resumed along the entire front there are indicationsthis has not been achieved without considerable opposition from the Russian AirForce operating against land forces. Taking into consideration the length ofthe front (over 1,000 miles) from the Black Sea to the Gulf of Finland, it isprobable that the Germans are finding their own fighter -strength, allowing forlosses and unserviceable aircraft, insufficient to afford full protection over theirarmoured divisions in forward areas as well as over troop concentrations and strategic points in the rear. The German long-range bomber units have been operating to a certain extent by night; the reason for this may also possibly bedue to lack of a sufficient number of fighters to escort them on daylight operations.70. Helsinki was bombed once on the 7th July, from Hango, and three timeson the 9th, and considerable damage was done. Kotka was severely attacked onthe 8th. About half the German anti-aircraft defences from Helsinki have beentransferred to the Borga area.Air Intelligence.Iran (Persia).71. A very reliable source reports that the Germans have offered to buildaircraft at the rate of a hundred a year in a factory at Tehran.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.72. There was only one occasion on which bombs were dropped on land in daylight during the week. On the evening of the 12th July an attack was madeon Staverton R.A.F. Station in Gloucestershire. Huts were damaged and therewere some casualties.By Night.73. There was little change in the intensity of enemy bombing comparedwith recent weeks. There was a sharp attack on Hull (10th/11th July) and lesserones on Yarmouth (13th/14th), on Hull again (14th/15th) and on Margate(15th/16th).On every night of the week bombs were dropped, but at widely separatedplaces. A little damage and a few casualties were caused at Lossiemouth,Leicester, Weymouth and Bridlington, and bombs were also dropped in Yorkshire,East Anglia, Lincolnshire, Essex, Cornwall and the Scilly Isles without serious effect.Damage.Hull (10th/11th and 14th/15th July).   .74. House property suffered the principal damage. Sixty-eight houses weredemolished and 115 damaged beyond repair.  &apos;[22728] c
Most utility services were temporarily affected. Although several gas and water mains were damaged and electricity services were cut off, supplies have since been reported to be normal.Railway services were dislocated at Stepney Station and delayed by a fireat Paragon Station Yard, but the lines were soon cleared.Workshops at Ellermans Wilson Line and a tannery were destroyed and railway warehouses and Blundells Oil Mills were damaged.Casualties.75. Casualties for the week ending 0600 16th July, are estimated at59 killed and 85 seriously injured, of whom 47 were killed and 73 injured at Hull.

Some of this tonnage has been taken over and put into service by the United States and some South american republics.Note. A re-survey was recently carried out to determine the average tonnage of unidentifiedships being sunk; this showed that the over-all average of 5,000 hitherto adopted was rather too high for German ships, but not high enough for Italian ships. A closer approximation will begiven, therefore, by adopting 4,000 tons as the average for German ships and 5,500 for italian ships. The estimated tonnage of unidentified ships in the table above has been brought into conformity with the new averages accordingly. The effect has been to decrease the estimatedGerman tonnage losses by 254 and to increase the Italian by 75 thousand gross tons a nettotal decrease of 179 thousand gross tons.APPENDIX V.Casualties to H.M.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Munster. Photographs taken on the 8th July after the first two attacksshow that the main damage was confined to the port, industrial area andaerodrome in the South-East of the town. The town at this time had sufferedlittle damage.   The principal features are : (a) Port and Industrial Area. A triangular area to the south of the inland port measuring 450 x 580 x 580 yards which contained an industrial district has been severely damaged by a considerablenumber of H.E. and incendiary bombs. Warehouses and workshopshave large holes in their roofs and the ground is charred and cratered.15 to 20 buildings have been destroyed or damaged, one about 350feet square and the few small buildings that remain have probably been affected by lateral blast. In another area of the port one bay ofa large warehouse has been destroyed and the area has a whitenedand charred effect.(b) The Aerodrome. The hangars and buildings in the North of the aerodrome have been badly damaged and at least four of them are completely burnt out. The railway track skirting the north boundary of the aerodrome received a direct hit and there are 19 craters in the landing ground.(c) The Raihvay Station and Marshalling Yards. The remains of two trainsdestroyed by fire and blast are seen. There is a crater near the turn-table and another in the centre of the station yard.Cologne. The following damage was caused in the raid of the 16th/17thJune: The Chemical Works of I. G. Farben at Leverkusen were hit, Theprincipal entrance to the main station was seriously damaged and a building-opposite destroyed, the cathedral windows were broken, the well-known CafeBauer was destroyed, and many other buildings in the important HoheStrasse were hit.On the morning of the 8th July several railway trucks and carriages were still burning near the station, which had been hit the previous night.Mannheim. Our raid of the 9th/10th May is described as the most seriousexperienced in South-West Germany. Seventeen water mains were broken andhuge fires were started. Some small factories were destroyed, but the principaldamage was that which was wrought in the Daimler-Benz armoured-car factory and the Heinrich Lanz machine-tool works. At &quot;the former only 3,000 out of thenormal 6,000 employees had been able to return to work, and these were mostlyengaged in doing repairs. It was thought that it would take the factory between three and four months to resume full operations. The destruction at the HeinrichLanz factory was on a comparable scale. It was reliably estimated that casualties in that raid and the two previous ones were about 600, including between 200 and300 dead.Kiel Canal. At the&quot;end of the first week in June there were two vesselssunk in the canal 50 yards apart and 12 kilometres from Brunsbuttel.Shipping. In the raids on Emden on the 7th/8th and 8th/9th April theBurgenland, of 7,320 tons, and the Bukarest, of 4,400 tons, were sunk, and inthe raids on Bremerhaven on the 7th/8th and 9th/T0th April six ships loaded with war supplies were sunk.
France.Meaulte. Photographs taken during the daylight attack on the 7th july show direct hits on machine shops, the West end of the main assembly hangars,the general assembly shop and the stores department for spare parts.Chocques-Photographs taken during the daylight attack on the 7th Julyon the chemical works and power station show direct hits on the power -house, onan important building in the chemical works, where two gas holders appear tohave been damaged by bombs bursting alongside, on the railway sidings and onrolling stock therein, and on what is believed to be a benzol and by-productsplant nearby.Cherbourg: Photographs taken during the daylight attack on the 10th july show a direct hit on the oil pumping station on the east quay of the DarseTransatlantique and a burst close to a tanker nearby. The pumping station was seen to be burning furiously, flames rising to a height of 250 feet.Hazebrouck. In the raid of the 25th June a train full of Pioneers was hit and more than 200 of the men were killed.V
