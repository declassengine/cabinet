(41) 167.July 17, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON THE ACTION OF THE 2ND ARMOURED DIVISION.(Reference : W.P. (41) 159.)Note by the Secretary of the War Cabinet.THE annexed Directive issued by General Wavell is circulated, by directionof the Prime Minister, with reference to paragraph 3 of W.P. (41) 159.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 17, 1941.Directive.To Lieut.-General P. Neame, V.C., C.B., D.S.O.. Military Governor and .O.C&apos;.-in-C&apos;., Cyrenaica.March 19, 1941.DEFENCE OF CYRENAICA.YOUR present task is to defend Cyrenaica against a possible enemy counter-attack. The enemy, if he attacks, will have local superiority both on the ground and in the air, until it is possible to send you reinforcements at a later date.The safeguarding of your forces from a serious reverse and the infliction of losses and ultimate defeat on the enemy are of much greater importance than theretention of ground. The re-occupation of Benghazi by the enemy, though itwould have considerable &quot;propaganda and prestige value, would be of littlemilitary importance, and it is certainly not worth while risking defeat toretain it,You will consider whether the present position East of Agheila could be improved by an operation to advance to the defile formed by the salt marshesWest of Agheila.2. Whatever the position eventually held about the frontier at Agheila,you should retain there only mobile covering forces, whose object should be byoffensive patrolling to discover the enemy&apos;s strength and to conceal ours, and to delay his advance as long, as possible without risking serious defeat. Thesecovering forces must, therefore, be completely mobile, must be able tomanoeuvre rapidly in retreat if necessary and must contain no superfluoustroops which could be better employed further back. You should consider carefully their strength and dispositions from time to time.[22729]
3. If these covering forces are compelled to withdraw before superiorenemy forces, the general plan of withdrawal should be that a small mobile forceof infantry and guns should withdraw down the main road towards Benghazi,delaying the enemy and inflicting loss on him without becoming seriouslyengaged; while the armoured troops take up a position on the flank towardsAntelat, with the object of discovering the direction of the enemy&apos;s advance,which may be North towards Benghazi or possibly North-East across the deserttowards Tobruk. The armoured troops will operate against the flank or rear ofthe enemy force if opportunity offers, and if the enemy is too strong to attackwill withdraw, manoeuvring so as always to be on the flank of the enemy whicheverdirection he takes. To enable this to be done it will be necessary to establishdumps of petrol and water at selected places. Opportunity should be takenwhere possible along the coast road or elsewhere to manoeuvre the enemy on toconcealed minefields.4. If the enemy advances North on Benghazi, it is of no use attempting tohold any position with infantry in the flat plain South of Benghazi; such aposition could be rapidly turned. You will consider whether a position can befound immediately South of Benghazi between the escarpment and the sea onwhich the enemy can be opposed and held with a good chance of success by theforce which you will have available. Such a position should be strengthened by tank obstacles, minefields and defence works as necessary. You can presumablyobtain local labour for defence works if required.5. If, in view of the strength employed by the enemy, you find it impossibleto hold any position South of Benghazi, you should withdraw East and hold theroad leading up the escarpment immediately East of Benghazi, where the road and railway pass through the escarpment, and also the defile where the main road to Barce enters the hills.. 6., During the withdrawal great care must be taken that all stocks of petrol and any stores likely to be of value to the enemy should be destroyed. If it isnecessary to abandon Benghazi the harbour must be, so far as possible, renderedunusable by the enemy.7. A separate note is being sent you of the reinforcements which it ishoped will be made available for you and the approximate date of their arrival.Transport is scarce everywhere, and you must conserve your resources with theutmost care, preventing waste by over-driving, misuse or bad maintenance.8. Remember that the enemy&apos;s supply and maintenance problem will be amost difficult and precarious one, and do everything in your power to render it more so. Forward dumps of stores are likely to be the surest indication of the offensive intentions of the enemy and should be attacked by air action as far aspossible. Similarly, during the advance, attack on his maintenance system willbe one of the best methods of bringing him to a standstill.9. The attitude of the civil population requires careful attention. Theproblem of security must be closeiy^studied, and at the same time the populationmust be made content with British administration so that there is no incentive to assist the enemy&apos;s return.10. Time is pressing, and you must put all necessary moves and work inhand without the least delay.(Signed) ARTHUR SMITH, Major-General,Deputy Chief, General Staff.
