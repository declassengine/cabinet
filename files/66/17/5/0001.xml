WAR.   CABINET.W.Pt(41) 132*JUNE 17, 1941.Measures concerning Merchant shipping in the event of War or generalhostilities with Vichy.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty..Two special problems concerning the control of merchantshipping will arise in the event of war or general hostilities with vichy France(1)   action regarding French Indo-China;&quot;  ;-. . (2)   action&apos;regarding Free French ships and-ships manned by Free French orews. . .In order to provide for (l) I propose to send to theComander-in-Chief., China a signal which is attached to this paper asAnnexe (l).    The assumption on which the instructions in this signalare based is that, even if general hostilities break out in theMediterranean or in Afrioa it will be our policy if possible to keepIndo-China quiet.    The Japanese menace maybe expected to make AdmiralDeooux unwilling to embroil himself in hostilities with ourselves, andthere seems a reasonable chance of maintaining the peace if not thestatjasv quo on the China Station. .   In my view the paucity of our naval forces/inthe Far East and the need to avoid giving the Japanese anypretext:&apos;for intervention in Indo-China renders it most desirable to       1prevent-hostilities spreading to Indo-China.     If this is accepted it willnot be our relations with Vichy but the attitude of Admiral Decoux whichwill determine our action in the Far East.     Accordingly my instructionsgive to the Commander-in-Ghief, China, who will be in the best positionto judge the intentions of Admiral Decoux, a large measure of discretionso far as action against French ships is concerned.     I do not, however,think that any chance can be taken concerning the safety of British and allied......COPY No.    (&quot;,, 8
Allied snipping and On the outbreak of hostilities with Vichy it mustbe kept away from Indo-China until satisfactory assurances have beenobtained from Admiral Decoux.In order .to &quot;provide for (2) I propose to send the signal inAnnexe (2) of this paper. .   -The protection of British and Allied shipping\ against attack by Vichy Naval Forces is. of course.,; a matter for the-appropriate,..Departments of the Admiralty and for Naval authorities-inport &quot;localities.    -The quantity of. shipping at risk off the West coast - of africa has already been thinned., by re-routeing a number of ships overtowards the South American coast.     But-merchant ships with Free Frenchcrews must, I think, be dealt with specially.     Some of these crews arecomposed of- men from captured French ships who have volunteered only-after persuasion.     Consequently, although it is believed that they willremain loyal, some precautions &apos; seem&apos;necessary. &apos;. The gist of my instructionsis that&apos; such ships if. in port should be&apos; detained until we are satisfied^concerning,, the sentiments of the   orew&quot;&apos;and that those sailing independentlyon the&apos;: high seas-&apos;should be instructed&apos;tOr make for a British port.     Thenumber,of vessels&apos;.involved&apos;Is upwards of .40, and in practice all ofthese-&apos;-except one or., two would.&apos;be likely, at any given moment to be inport-&apos;.or sailing ..convoy.     In. most cases the measures taken could be explained as arising ouifcf of, the Naval.situation created by the entry ofVichy into the- war, ana:i it should&quot;&quot;&apos;be.: possible to execute them without giving offence to the leaders of &quot;the; Free French movement-.&apos;In-preparing these two-&apos; signals I have consulted other interested Departments-who have &quot;expressed concurrence in the terms ofthe,draftsThe signal.concerning action on the China Station has been&apos; submitted &quot;to,.the Far--Eastern Committee and received its approval.A.
