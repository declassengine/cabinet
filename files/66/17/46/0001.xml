(41) 70thConclusions), invited me to circulate my &quot;proposals, as already submitted to theLord President&apos;s Committee, for a revision of the Railway Control Agreement,and to submit a Paper setting out the proposed changes in the control and higherorganisation of the Railways.The Railway Control Agreement.2. My proposals for a revision of the Railway Control Agreement are contained in the Memorandum printed as an Appendix to this Paper. ThisMemorandum was submitted to the Lord Presidents Committee, which, at its meeting on 3rd July, 1941 (L.P. (41) 28th Meeting, Minute 4), recorded the viewthat the terms proposed represented a reasonable rental payment to the RailwayCompanies during the control period.Control and &quot;Higher Organisation of the Railways.3. On the outbreak of war the Minister of Transport took control of theRailways by an Order under Defence Regulation 69. The effect is that the controlled undertakings must be carried on in accordance with his directions andthat all their property (other than currency, gold, securities or negotiableinstruments) is at his disposal. In form the Regulation differs from the Regula-tion of the Forces Act, 1871, under which &quot;possession&quot; was taken of theRailways by the Government in 1914, but the effects are similar and the Ministerscontrol is complete so long as the Control Order is in force.4. On taking control the Minister appointed the Railway ExecutiveCommittee (consisting of the four General Managers and a representative ofthe L.P.T.B., with Sir Ralph Wedgwood as Chairman) to be his agents for thepurpose of giving directions under the Control Order. At the same time heinstructed the Railway Managements to carry on as usual, subject to the directions of the Committee. The Minister had, at an earlier stage, issued general instruc-tions to General Managers on control of the railways and working of essentialtraffic during an emergency, and these instructions came into immediate operation on control being taken. An officer of the Ministry was appointed Railway ControlOfficer as the means of communicating the Minister&apos;s wishes to the Committee.He was subsequently made a member of the Committee.Memorandum by the Minister ofWar Transport.
5. It is thus clear that, under the Control Order I possess all the powersrequired to secure the operation of the Railways in the interests of the State andof the war effort. It becomes, therefore, only a question of the extent to whichpowers are exercised and of the efficiency of the machine for carrying out mydirections.6. A primary object&quot; of control and of the appointment of the railway executive Committee of General Managers as the Ministers agents was tosecure that under war conditions there should be the necessary centraliseddirection of operation. Each of the controlled undertakings is under the directionof the Executive Committee, who in turn derive their authority direct fromthe Minister. Through them he communicates his instructions to the Manage-ments, individually or collectively, as occasion may require. The initiative of individual managements and their responsibility for day-to-day operations is thus preserved (and it is essential that it should be), while they are knit together as a war machine under the direction of the Executive Committee. In certain respects, where closer working between the different systems has been necessarythis has been secured by joint machinery, such as the Central Wagon Control and central Stores and Purchasing Organisation. I understand that such arrange-ments have on occasions had to be imposed by pressure on the Companies, andthere may well be other directions in which improvements can be achieved. by making a change in the Chairmanship, by appointing a Deputy Chairman, andby requiring a proper division of function between the various members of theExecutive Committee, who would be allotted a defined sphere of responsibilityover the whole network of railways, I hope to expedite these improvements and todevelop a spirit of more willing co-operation than has sometimes existed on theCommittee as at present constituted.7. The pool of receipts and expenditure has in itself brought aboutabandonment of traffic clearances between Companies, so that competitive interestsin traffic have ceased between the parties.8. The alteration in the basis of the financial agreement by the elimination of the profit-sharing element will in itself conduce to a more whole-heartedidentification of the railway managements with the Ministry.9. Under the Control Order the Boards of Directors of the Companies retain their responsibilities in regard to capital expenditure and distribution of thenet receipts accruing to the Companies. It is not the practice of the Boards to intervene in the day to day working of the railways. In such matters, the railwaymanagements carry on subject only to the directions of the Minister and theRailway Executive Committee. The General Managers as Agents of the Ministerare bound to carry out such directions and no action of the Chairmen or the boards could counteract such directions or divert the Managers from compliance with them.L.Ministry of War Transport,July 21, 1941.
The Railway Control Agreement.[Memorandum submitted to the Lord President&apos;s Committee by theMinister of War Transport.)AT the meeting of the Lord President&apos;s Committee on the 23rd May(L.P. (41) 21st Meeting, Minute 2) I was authorised to open negotiations withthe railway companies&apos;on the question of compensation for war damage, on thelines of the proposals applicable to public utilities generally. I have met theRailway Chairmen, and representatives of the Ministry have had three meetings with the Railway General Managers. Close touch has been maintained with theTreasury.2. After consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I informed theRailway Chairmen that it was intended to apply the proposals concerning war damage to public utility companies over all the field. This meant the elimination of the provision in the present railway agreement under which the cost of war damage is to be taken into account when reviewing charges up to a maximum of 10,000,000 in any one year. I also drew attention to the statement made by theChancellor in the Budget speech as to the Government&apos;s policy in regard to the stabilisation of transport charges. The Railway Chahmren agreed that these factors made it necessary to modify the present agreement as from the1st January, 1941.3. Discussion on this basis has proceeded with the Railway general managers and Lord Ashfield, representing the London Passenger transport board, who have been informed that the Government propose to substitute a fixedpayment for the existing financial arrangements. After considering the matter,the General Managers have refrained from proposing a figure for the fixedpayment, but have submitted certain data which they regard as representingfactors which should be taken into consideration. A copy of their statement,which covers the main line railways and the London Passenger Transport Board,is annexed. The Chairmen have already indicated that they feel entitled, under any revised terms, to compensation not less favourable than that to which theyare entitled under the present financial arrangements.4. The data submitted by the railways are built up to constitute the ne trevenue in 1940 and 1941 based on the continuance and strict execution of theexisting agreement with no charge for war damage and no &quot;lag&quot; betweenincreased costs and increased charges. In fact there is an unbridged gap inrespect of 1940 under the latter head amounting to about  11-8 million, apartfrom a similar gap of  2 million in respect of the control period of 1939. If theold agreement had continued this gap would eventually have been closed, and evenin the altered circumstances there is one element in it which it is difficult todispute, namely, that which can be attributed to delay on the part of the Govern-ment in implementing its undertaking to increase charges promptly as provided in the present agreement. The amount of revenue thus lost in 1940 is estimatedat about  3^ million.Tw^o alternative figures are shown for 1941 both based on the results for thefirst .20 weeks of the year. The first alternative is expressed at an annual rate on a daily basis, the second upon the increase in the net revenue of the first20 weeks of 1941 over the corresponding period of 1940. The latter comparison is vitiated by the abnormal weather conditions which dislocated traffic, in theearly months of 1940. On the other hand, the first alternative does not reflectfully the seasonal variations in traffic throughout the year and thus tends tounderstate the net revenue. The 1941 figures assume that interference withtraffic resulting from air-raids, &amp;c, will not be on a scale in excess of that sufferedbetween January and May of this year, and therefore ignore the effect of thepossible return of heavy bombing or the contingency of invasion.
5. Subject to these points and to verification of figures the salient data areas follows :   millions.A. Standard revenue (fixed under the Railways Act. 1921)      55-3B. Existing minimum guaranteechargingC. Current net revenues (a) &quot;Pool&quot;  earnings  1940   (after 1-7 million for war damage) ...(b) 1940 (notional, i.e., if war damage chargehad been excluded and all increased costshad    been    recovered    currently    by increased charges in full)(a) 1941 on the same basis as (b) above (i) if daily rate of net revenue for thefirst 20 &quot;weeks of year continues ...(ii) if increase in net revenue of first20 weeks of 1941 over corres-ponding period of 1940 is main-tained39-4Railway sharesunder existing arrangements(balance to total.       Exchequer).42-3 All55-7 49-452-7 47-861-3 52-2D. War Damage.The quid pro quo for the change in the method of dealing with war damage is put at  2i million a year.6.   There are three main issues : (a) The amount, if any, necessary to reflect the fact that under the present proposals the railways would lose the right to recover increasedworking costs by increased charges spread over the future. This isshortly described as the &quot;lag.&quot;(b) The amount, if any, which should be included in the fixed payment byway of compensation for any worsening of the railway position inrespect of recovery of cost of war damage.(c) The amount of the fixed annual payment to be substituted for the present scheme of compensation.7. So far as war damage is concerned, it has been made clear to the RailwayManagers that the character of the charge for this liability had completelychanged since the draft agreement was drawn up. It was now, by statute, to bea capital charge and not a working expense. So far as any &quot; quid pro quo &quot; forthe introduction of the new scheme was concerned, the Managers were told thatthe Government did not accept the companies&apos; interpretation of the existing arrangements, which would put them in a better position than any other propertyowner, public utility or otherwise and pre-supposed that, whatever the rate of damage, the Government were to continue to bear the first  10 million in any year, instead of one-half of it as envisaged in the new scheme.A more reasonable basis of comparison would, it was suggested, be to workout and compare the total sum which the companies would be entitled to recover(either through increases in charges, or from the Government) in respect of thewhole of their war damage, (a) under the draft agreement, and (b) under the new scheme. Looked at in this way it could not be said that one arrangement wasnecessarily more or less favourable than the other; it all depended upon the amountof damage.8. The revision of the draft agreement, apart from the change in the basisof compensation, was also discussed at the meeting, and substantial agreement was reached, except upon one technical point which is still under discussionbut need not delay the main negotiations.
9. Apart from the question of the fixed payment itself, there is a matter which arises out of the change in the basis of compensation as to which the managers and Lord Ashfield have made strong representations. They point outthat, if the existing scheme were adhered to. the economic stability of the railwayindustry would be maintained by a continual adjustment of charges to expenditure,, but that this will cease if railway charges are &quot; pegged &quot; asproposed by the Government. They therefore seek an assurance from the Govern-ment that control on the basis of a fixed payment will be continued until therehas been reasonable time to adjust railway charges to the post-war level of costs of operation. In the absence of some such assurance, there may be difficulty inobtaining a full and complete discharge of all Government liabilities in respectof the control.10.   To sum up :  There seems to be no prospect of reaching agreement on any figure which isnot substantially in excess of the existing minimum guarantee ( 40 million). Thenet revenue of the Pool in 1940 ( 42 - 3 million) is a figure to which the railways,upon their own line of argument, could legitimately claim some addition inrespect of (a) the amount ( 1-7 million) of the 1940 charge to revenue for war damage, and (b) the amount of the &quot;lag&quot; in 1940 due to Government delay in increasing charges ( 3J million). They have, in addition, arguable claims forsome consideration for the fact that (c) the balance of the &quot; lag &quot; will be lost tothem permanently and that (d) they will, under the War Damage Scheme, haveto meet up to 50 per cent, of the total cost of war damage instead of recoveringthe first  10 million in any year from railway users. If points (a) and (b) onlybe met, the 1940 net revenue becomes about  47^ million, of which, under thepresent financial arrangements, the railways would have retained  45^ million.It seems necessary at this stage to bring home to the railways the consequences of two essential facts:  (a) Railway charges are now to be kept steady. The general lines adoptedin the original agreement cease to be applicable and the amount of profit allowed to the railways must be reconsidered in a new light.(6) The war damage scheme may prove to be either more favourable or less favourable to the railways than what was envisaged in the originalagreement. But the railways, like all other industrial undertakings,must now fall under the new scheme.It is necessary therefore to dismiss the line of approach adopted by theRailway Managers. The argument would ioro cocci that owing to the stabilisationpolicy the railways should be remunerated by a fixed payment related to pre-warearnings. In ordinary circumstances the Government would regard as appro-priate, under the new conditions, the sum of  39-4 million per annum which hasbeen taken as the pre-war average and is an average favourable to the railwaysbecause it omits the year 1938, which was a bad year. But having regard to allthe circumstances, including the circumstances that the railways were losersin 1940 by reason of delay in increasing charges in that year while the oldagreement was still in force, and out of consideration for their views about thenew war damage scheme, the Government would be prepared to continue thefigure of  42-3 million, which was the amount of profit shown in their accounts for the year 1940 under the terms of the old agreement as it in fact worked out.It may be necessary in negotiation to go as far as  43 million, the amount,which, under the old agreement, the railways are entitled to retain in full (withoutsurrendering part to the Exchequer) if they earn as much.Ministry of War Transport.1st July, 1941.
