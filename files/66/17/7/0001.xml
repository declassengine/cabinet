COPY NO,    ? 619 th Jane, 1941.WAR    CABINET.SINK AT SIGHT ZONE IN EVENT OF hostilities with VICHY.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.Shipping proceeding to the ports of SouthernFrance has long been carrying essential war materialsdestined for Germany and Italy,  and the produce of Vichy&apos;s&quot;African colonies is in present circumstances vital to&apos; the economy of France.      I therefore consider it necessary inthe event of hostilities with Vichy becoming general to declare a zone dangerous to shipping in the western basin^of the Mediterranean for the purpose of striking at the traffic between Africa and metropolitan ports,2.      The present  situation is that all the waters of the eastern and central Mediterranean have been declared dangerous to shipping, the western limit ofthe zone being roughly speaking a line drawn 30 milesalong the west coast of North Italy and Sardinia, andproceeding from a point 30 miles due south of Sardiniato the limit of territorial waters off Cape Bon in Tunis,Hosti: &quot;.ties with both Vichy and Vichy African Colonies.3.      Assuming that the Iberian Peninsula does not also become involved in the war and that hostilities breakout with both Vichy France and Vichy African territories,I propose that the Mediterranean zone should be extended toinclude all waters to the east of a line joining thefollowing points:-(a) Gape Milonia (Boundary of Algeria and spanish morocco).(b) A point 20 miles 180 degrees from Cape de Gatain Spain.(c) 39G 46&apos;  N.  040 50&apos; E.   (East of Minorca).(d) A point 3 miles 090 degrees from Cape de Oreus(Position 42Q 19&apos;   N.  03O 19&apos;  E. Approx).and thence northwards along the limit of Spanish&apos; -territorial waters to the Franco-Spanish boundary.-1-

574.      I appreciate that an important cojaai-d^*ojiioai isto avoid giving the Spaniards the impression that we areblockading Spain.      My proposals leave all the waters tothe west of the Spanish Morocco - Algeria border free, andalso a wide triangle of free water with the east coast of spain as its &quot;base,  and its apex a point 25 miles to theeast of the  Balearics,      The trade of the Balearic Islandsis exclusively with ports on the Spanish rna.inland andthe zone proioosed gives ample room to meet all therequirements of Spanish coastal trade.      Cape de Gatawhere the zone may appear to press closest  to the Spanishmainland is one of the main navigation marks in thewestern Mediterranean, and all coastal shipping makes alandfall close to that point,  so that the strip left freeshould be ample for all legitimate trade.        It is for operational reasons essential to carry the limits of the&apos;zone as far from the French coasts as possible so thatour intercepting forces may operate outside the effectiverange of French air and anti-submarine forces,.5o       I attach (Appendix I) a draft notice to neutral governments in which the freedom of trade left to Spanishshipping is underlined in order to give due weight.to spanish susceptibilities -6c      I attach also  (Appendix 2) a draft of theinstructions which I oro-pose to issue concerning the actionto be  taken within the zone when declared.      A few Spanishships trade to Genoa and to Marseilles and it is advisable to avoid as far as possible the sinking of Spanish shipseven within the zone,      Experience nas taught us however that authority to sink at  sight is of little avail unless it is comprehensive..    A &apos;sink at sight&apos; policy is operatedprimarily by aircraft which find it almost impossible to- identify ships,  or by submarines whose best opportunities for attack are in the dark hours or in low visibility whenidentification of merchant ships is difficult.        i therefore propose,  if this zone is declared to issue thesame instructions as the Defence Committee has already approved for the Gulf of Genoa, namely that all vesselsmay be attacked within the  zone without warning unlessidentified as Spanish,  or as one of the vessels proceeding,to and from Genoa in the interests of the Swiss withapproved cargoes.      The movements of these latter ships would be notified in our attacking forces as necessary,a procedure similar to that in force in other areas.Hostilities- with, Vichy Franee alone.7.      Although the considerations mentioned inparagraph 1 above would still apply,  the question whether any   &apos;sink at sight&apos;   zone should be declared would,  I think ?have to be decided at the time in the light of all thecircumstances.      Should, for example, General Weygandremain passive but appear unfavourable to us we mightpresumably decide to refrain from any declaration in thehope of keeping French North Africa quiet.      On the otherhand we might feel able to declare a more limited area in northern waters.      I do not think, however, for thereasons given, that it is advisable to make any definite proposals in advance to meet this situationoA.V.A.ADMIRALTY.
