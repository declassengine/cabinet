THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.___  /______SECRET,Copy No.W.P. (41) 168.July 17, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.CO-OPERATION WITH THE NETHERLANDS government regarding   MUTUAL   SUPPORT    IN   THE    EVENT    of japanese AGGRESSION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.DURING the last few months my colleagues have had to consider at intervalsthe question of exchanging assurances with the Netherlands government regarding mutual support in the event of our Far Eastern possessions being attacked by Japan.2. In a memorandum of the 3rd July (W.P. (41) 150) I showed that thisquestion had been raised in another form by an enquiry from the netherlands government as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to &quot; ratify &quot;the proceedings of the Singapore staff conferences held in February and april last. Before this memorandum could be considered by the Cabinet the situation had been slightly altered by news that the United States Chiefs of Staff were unlikely to agree to the report of the April conference (in which United states representatives participated as full members) because they had certain criticismsto make of the naval sections of the report.3. In the light of this development our own Chiefs of Staff havedecided to withhold their approval of the report of the conference of the2lst-27th April, but I understand that they see no reason to modify their previousapproval of the reports of the Anglo-Dutch-Australian conference of the22nd-25th February and the British-Dutch conversations of the 27th April.They have, in fact, reaffirmed their previous conclusions in regard to thetwo last-named reports, and these conclusions include an invitation to theForeign Office to inform the Netherlands Government that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment approve the military clauses of the reports, with the proviso that no political commitment is implied, and the reservation that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must retain complete freedom, to decide what should constitute an act of war &apos;&apos; by Japan.4. A communication on these lines would, I fear, produce the worst impression on the Netherlands Government, who would regard it as a flat refusal to give any assurance of support in the event of Japanese aggression, and even as implying that such support would in fact not be given. This is the moreundesirable in that the Defence Committee, at its meeting on the 15th May.approved the principle of mutual assurances between ourselves and the Dutch,and that this is also approved by the Government of New Zealand and (provided the assurance is private) by the Government of Australia, irrespective of theattitude of the United States.
5. I submit that, at a time when we know that the Japanese have it inmind within the next few days to seize bases in Indo-China, which pan only bea threat to Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies, we cannot hesitate longer to enter into a political commitment with the Dutch.6. In connexion with present Japanese plans, the Chiefs of Staff have asked the Foreign Office to invite the Netherlands Government to give authorityfor the despatch of Australian forces to Koepang and Ambon in the netherlands east Indies immediately the Japanese make a move into Indo-China. But theChiefs of Staff add that this invitation should only be made if it can be done without leading the Dutch authorities to believe that we are going beyond existingpolitical commitments. Now it seems extremely unlikely that the netherlands government would agree to this movement of Australian forces into one partof the Netherlands East Indies in the absence of any assurance that they will receive the support of Australia and ourselves in the event of other parts ofthe Netherlands East Indies being attacked by Japan. This again illustrates the need for an urgent decision regarding an assurance to the netherlands government.7. The question is, I think, still capable of solution on the general lines proposed in my memorandum of the 3rd July (W.P. (41) 150), and I attach thedraft of a note which might be addressed to the Netherlands Minister. If mycolleagues approve the terms of this note. I would suggest that its substancebe telegraphed at once to the Dominion Governments as a communication whichwe propose to make urgently to the Netherlands Government unless they informus by a. certain time that they see serious objection.A. E.foreign Office, July 17. 1941.ANNEX.Draft Note to the Netherlands Minister.(Secret.)Your Excellency, Foreign Office, July     , 1941.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, have given carefulconsideration to your Excellency&apos;s note No. 1731, Secret, of the 12th June, inwhich you made, on behalf of the Royal Netherlands Government, certain proposals regarding the &apos;&apos; ratification &apos;&apos; of the proceedings of the staff talkswhich took place at Singapore between United Kingdom, Australian and netherlands representatives from the 22nd-25th February last, between repre-sentatives of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, India, theNetherlands and the United States from the 21st-27th April and between Britishand Netherlands representatives on the 27th April.2. In employing the term &quot; ratification &quot; in regard to the proceedings ofthese conversations, your Excellency was following the wording of the reportsembodying their results, but you will, I am sure, agree with me that the term, inits technical diplomatic sense, is not altogether appropriate in relation to thepresent question, and that what is required is merely the approval or confirmation by the Governments concerned of the recommendations made by theirrepresentatives.3. So far as the conversations of the 21st-27th April are concerned, HisMajesty&apos;s Government are not yet in a position to give the necessary approval,since the United States Service authorities are understood to be about to proposecertain modifications which may necessitate further discussion.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government see no reason, however, why this should delayaction in regard to the conversations between the United Kingdom, australian and Netherlands representatives of the 22nd-25th February and the conversations between British and Netherlands representatives recorded in the report of the27th April.   I am accordingly authorised to inform your Excellency that His
Majesty&apos;s Government, having considered the recommendations contained in thereports of these conversations, give their general approval to those recommenda-tions as the basis for the preparation of future plans.5. The recommendations were in both cases specifically stated to involve no political commitment. Nevertheless, the delegates expressed the view that any action against one of the parties was of vital importance for the others, and theyemphasised the importance of an agreement between the Governments concerned to co-operate fully in the event of any one of them being forced to take military action to counter Japanese aggression. Furthermore, in paragraphs 23-27headed &quot; Necessity for collective action,&quot; the report of the conference of the22nd-25th February defined a number of circumstances which would, in the viewof the conference, necessitate immediate military counter-action.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are, for their part,prepared to join with the other Governments concerned in a reciprocal agreement to co-operate to the full extent of their available resources in the event of anyone of them being forced to take military action to counter armed action byJapanese forces agains its territory or mandated territory. They are preparedto regard such an agreement as binding on themselves vis-a-vis the netherlands government when it has been accepted by that Government and the Governmentsof Australia and New Zealand. They do not think it possible to agree thatarmed action should automatically be taken in the eventualities mentioned in*sub-paragraphs (&amp;)-(/) of paragraph 24 of the report of the conference of the22nd-25th February,. but they are prepared to agree that such Japanese move-ments should be the subject of most immediate consultation between the-Goyern-ments concerned. His Majesty&apos;s Government are impressed with the importanceof working out a procedure to facilitate and expedite such consultation. They&quot;are themselves talking steps to improve the machinery in this respect and proposeto ask for the co-operation of the Netherlands Government in this matter.
