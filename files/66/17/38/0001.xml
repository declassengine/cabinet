THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT .Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.SECRET. TO BE KEPT UNDER LOOK   N[ Copy No.    3W.P. (41) 165. It is requested that special cJuly 14, 1941. ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET. /&quot;- \/INTERNATIONAL AIR FORCE FOR CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Burma.ON the recommendation of the Far Eastern Committee I submit two points on which an urgent decision is required in regard to the International Air force for China.2. It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as a means of assistingChina, to give support to this force, which will be manned by American personnel,and it was agreed that 244 American fighter aircraft (100 Tomahawks and144 Vultees) should for this purpose be released from the British allotment.Arrangements for enabling the force to come into action in China have now reached a fairly advanced stage. Of the 100 Tomahawks it is known that 36 havealready arrived at Rangoon, and American ex-Serviee pilots to fly them will shortly be arriving. . Personnel are being recruited in the United States ofAmerica for the 144 Vultees. The Force will be under the command of ColonelChennault, a retired officer of the United States Army Air Corps. He was dueto leave San Francisco on the 8th July and is expected to arrive in Chungkingabout the 15th July and to proceed to Rangoon about the 25th July.3. A telegram from Washington states that Colonel Chennault informedour Air Attache there that, as the Japanese are aware of China&apos;s plans for theformation of this force, he desires that the Tomahawk fighters now arriving atRangoon should not leave that place until everything is ready for them to go into action in China and the pilots and mechanics are fully acquainted with theoperation and maintenance of the aircraft. It is necessary to send instructionsto the Governor of Burma so that he may be sition to reply to these requestsas soon as Colonel Chennault arrives at Rangoon.4. In their Conclusions 308 (40), dated the 19th December last, the WarCabinet approved a proposal that military aircraft might be assembled in burma and exported under their own power to China, provided they were notin a condition to engage in hostilities en route, i.e., in the case of fighter aircraft,without their guns being fitted and without carrying ammunition. This conditionwas made, partly in order to smooth over difficulties which were at that timeexpected with Burmese Ministers, and partly in order to avoid any risk of violentreactions on the part of Japan. At that time the project for an international air Force had not developed, and the main question under consideration was theprovision of an alternative site for a Chinese aircraft factory at Loiwing whichwas exposed to Japanese bombing, and which it was decided might be moved toa site in India.5. The Governor of Burma has now reported that his Premier is preparedto take a realistic view of the question of gun-mounting, &amp;c, and Sir R. Dorman-Smith sees no reason to expect any opposition in Burma to whatever arrangements may be made after discussion with Colonel Chennault.[22714]
6. It is move necessary than ever to ensure that China has the means of continuing her struggle against Japan and the best means of assisting her is by enabling her to secure from other sources aircraft which we ourselves are unableto supply. As regards the risk of provoking a reaction on the part of Japan, it,is suggested that, if Japan decides to commence hostilities against us, she will do so as part of her wider plans at whatever moment she considers most opportune.If this is so, it seems unnecessary to attach too much weight to the risk of adversereactions on the part of Japan against assistance which we may give to theInternational Air Force. It is therefore suggested that we should be prepared,if this is necessary in order to meet Colonel Chennault&apos;s wishes, to allow theseTomahawks to have their guns fitted immediately prior to departure, and tocarry their ammunition on their flight into China, and to allow such instructionof the pilots and mechanics while waiting in Burma as may be found necessary.When Colonel Chennault arrives at Chungking it will be possible to ascertain from him more detailed particulars as to his wishes.7. The proposals which I would submit to the War Cabinet are that sir R. Dorman-Smith should be given discretion after consultation witl^ColonelChennault and in agreement with the Commander-in-Chief, Far East,(a) To allow the aircraft to have their guns and ammunition fitted beforestarting on their flight from Burma into China, if no other alter-native, such as fitting the armament at a Chinese aerodrome such asLoiwing, appears practicable;(b) To permit such instruction in the use and maintenance of the aircraftwhile they are in Burma as may be decided to be necessary, and asmay be practicable having regard to R.A.F. needs?&quot;)The Air Ministry concur generally in the above, but hold the view that,unless the War Cabinet are willing to take the appreciable additional risk of allowing the International Air Force to start its flying training in Burma, theexisting policy laid down in Chiefs of Staff 95th Meeting, Annex I, should be adhered to. This restricts flying, prior to their flight to China, to that whichis necessary for testing of aircraft after erection.L. S. A.Burma Office, July 14, 1941.
