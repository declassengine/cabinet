(41) 66th Conclusions, Minute 4.)THIS report must be read in its setting. It was never contemplated inLondon that the dispatch of an army to G-reece should lead to a dangerousweakening of the Cyrenaican frontier. The minimum force necessary to hold the Province was to be left there, and in addition Benghazi was to be made astrong naval and air base (Prime Minister&apos;s instructions to Mr. Eden, para-graph 4 (a), dated February 12, 1941). The main object of the advance tothe western frontier of Cyrenaica and the holding of Benghazi was to secure astrong flank for the protection of the Nile Valley and the invaluable aerodromessituated in Cyrenaica.2. One Brigade Group of the 2nd Armoured Division was sent to Greece.The 7th Armoured Division went back to the workshops in Cairo to refit. It was never reported that this refit of vehicles, instead of taking four or five weeks,would, in fact, take four or five months. Thus the armoured force left to hold the vital flank in Cyrenaica was inevitably reduced to the following formationsand units of the 2nd Armoured Division :-3rd Armoured Brigade : 3rd Hussars (Light Tanks).6th Royal Tank Regiment (re-equipping with Italian tanks).The Support Group.The K.D.G.&apos;s (Armoured Cars).[22692]
To this was added later the 5th Royal Tank Regiment (48 Cruiser Tanks).The deficiencies of this force in transport and the condition of their vehicles are fully set out in the report. (See also General WavelTs addenda to paragraph 6(black line).). No intimation of these weaknesses was made to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, who were entitled to suppose, in view of the telegrams above cited,that a.sufficient armoured force, properly equipped and well supported by air.had been left to guard the Western flank.3. Paragraph 8 states that &quot; the original, task of the 2nd Armoured division was to prevent the enemy occupying El Agheila.&quot; For this purpose the line ofthe marshes well to the west of the town was the indispensable position. This, itis stated, could not be held for lack of transport. An addition of say 500 lorrieswould have been sufficient for this, and it seems extraordinary that the whole ofthis number should not have been supplied at a time when no fewer than 8,800lorries were being embarked for Greece. For, what were the consequences foreseenand foreseeable. They were that all intention of holding El Agheila or Maradahad to be abandoned, and (paragraph 8) &quot;If the enemy were to advance, adelaying action would be fought in the area of Mersa Brega; and if a seriousattack developed the plan ivas to withdraw.&quot; But since withdrawal from ElAgheila, and thereafter from Mersa Brega, opened the doors of Cyrenaica to theenemy, entailed the loss of Benghazi and rendered immediately untenable theposition of the Australian Division, it is evident that a disaster of majorconsequence was certain to occur if the enemy advanced in any serious strength.While, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Government were left under the impression that adequate arrangements had been made to hold the essential positions guardingCyrenaica, the commander-in-Chief, Middle East, and the General commanding in Cyrenaica were resigned to disaster should the enemy press hard.4. It is often necessary in war to make woeful sacrifices in one part of the theatre in order to act in strength in another. But it was certainly wrong in theactual situation on the Cyrenaican frontier to proceed on the basis&quot;of withdrawalwith all its consequences in the face of attack without making this clear to HisMajesty&apos;s Government beforehand.5.   Upon the tactical story of the fighting, a few comments may be made : (a) There is an imperative need for every armoured formation to haveattached to it, and working with it, aircraft whose pilots and observershave been for some time in intimate association with the armouredunit, and who have the military knowledge and experience necessaryto enable them to report as correctly as possible, in all the difficultiesof war, what they see. The General commanding an armoured division should have his own aircraft, however few, attached to him, as much an integral part of his Command as his &quot;own divisional communicationcar.
(b) Attention is drawn to the confusing and unhelpful nomenclature and organisation of our armoured units. It is unreasonable andmisleading to speak of a unit as an &quot;armoured division,&quot; when infact it is only an armoured brigade with a support group or some extra details. The expressions &quot; 2nd Armoured Division, less oneBrigade,&quot; there being only two, which occur here as they do laterwith the 7th Division at Sollum, alone convict the system.(c) Several important instances are given of the effective use of motorisedartillery against hostile Tanks, and it would seem that a larger proportion of artillery should be used with every armoured brigade group and work with them in all circumstances. No fear of losingguns in this kind of warfare should prevent their going about withthe Tanks. No Armoured Force should grieve too much about losingsome of their guns if they have previously knocked out a number of enemy tanks with them.(d) It is difficult to base a defensive on armoured forces.   It should ratherbe the aim to employ large armoured formations on the offensive, tokeep them concentrated possible for that purpose, to contriveplaces and opportunities for them to achieve the highest manipula-tion of their power. The Tank formation is a weapon little concernedwith the lines or flanks of its own troops. Its supreme function lies in its impact and progression. Aided by good fortune, as Generalvon Rommel should have taught us, it makes the events by which itlives and thrives.6. The whole of this account shows how well and faithfully the troops ofall units acquitted themselves in the midst of so much order, counter-order and disorder.w. s. c.July 11, 1941.

REPORT ON  THE ACTION  OF  THE  2ND ARMOURED  DIVISIONDURING THE WITHDRAWAL FROM CYRENAICA,MARCH-APRIL 1941.1. The 2nd Armoured Division arrived in Egypt from the United kingdom on the 1st January, 1941, and went into camp at Tahag. It was commanded by major-General M. D. Gambier-Parry,* M.G., A.D.C., and consisted of the 1stArmoured Brigade (Brigadier R. Charrington), 3rd Armoured Brigade(Brigadier R. G. W. Rimington) and 2nd Support Group (Brigadier H. B. Latham).The 7th Armoured Division, the only other armoured division in the Middle East,was then in the middle of its successful campaign in Cyrenaica, which culminatedin the action at Beda Fomm on the 5th, 6th and 7th February. After that date,no enemy forces remained in Cyrenaica.2. During the month of February, while the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff were in the Middle East, thedecision was taken to send troops to Greece. It was essential that theyshould be accompanied by an armoured force, and it was equally essential that thegarrison of Cyrenaica should include armoured troops. Most of the tanks of the7th Armoured Division, after its six months of continuous campaigning, were obliged to enter workshops; so that both the force for Greece and the force forCyrenaica had to be found from the 2nd Armoured Division. It was therefore decided to allot the 1st Armoured Brigade to Greece, while the remainder of the division was to be sent to Cyrenaica.In actual fact, much interchange of units took place between the 1st and3rd Armoured Brigades, and even between the 2nd and 7th Armoured Divisions.The 2nd Armoured Division, as finally constituted in Cyrenaica, comprised thefollowing armoured units (apart from Artillery and the Support Group) : Divisional Cavalry Regiment: King&apos;s Dragoon Guards (armoured cars).3rd Armoured Brigade :3rd Hussars (light tanks).6th Royal Tank Regiment (re-equipping with Italian tanks):The 5th Royal Tank Regiment, a cruiser regiment, which had hitherto beenin general reserve in Cyrenaica under G.H.Q., was released on the 12th March.HQ., Cyrenaica, at once sent this unit forward from El Adem, and, when itarrived in the forward area some days later, it was put under command of the3rd Armoured Brigade.The full order of battle of the 2nd Armoured Division in Cyrenaica is givenin Appendix A.3. On the 24th March, the following enemy troops were considered to be in tripolitania : (a) German.One colonial armoured division or else part of a normal armoured division nearing completion.(b) Italian.One armoured division, 50 per cent, under strength.Four complete motorised divisions.Four infantry divisions.(c) Air Force.(i) German.200 long-range bombers.140 dive bombers.120 fighters.25 reconnaissance aircraft.(ii) Italian.50 bombers.100 fighters.Total : 645 aircraft, of which 500 were German.(d) 2,000 Motor Transport.* General Gambier-Parry took over command on the 17th February, 1941, on the death ofGeneral Tilley, who brought the Division from the United Kingdom
4. It was estimated that the enemy could concentrate forces for a counter-offensive against Cyrenaica. with maintenance for 30 days, as follows : (a) By the 16th April.One Italian motorized division, and one German colonial armoured division.(b) By the Uth May.One additional German colonial armoured division.(c) By the 24th May.One additional Italian division, armoured or portee.It was further considered that even if he could take Benghazi, he could not operate, for reasons of supply, more than one Italian motorized division and one german colonial armoured division in Cyrenaica. Even this could only bemaintained for a limited period.5.   The garrison of Cyrenaica was finally fixed as follows :  Headquarters &quot; Cyrcom &quot; (Lieut.-General P. Neame, V.C.) at Barce;9th  Australian  Division   (Major-General  Morshead),  area  Tocra-Er regime ;2nd Armoured Division, less one Armoured Brigade Group, area MersaBrega-Gtaeia, with headquarters at Bir Bu Gedaria.6. The state of Armoured Fighting Vehicles of the 3rd Armoured Brigadewas extremely bad. The 3rd Hussars had 33 light tanks out of 52 and these werein an extremely poor condition; an Ordnance Mechanical Engineer report statedthat gear boxes and transmissions were badly worn and that all tanks in this unitneeded an overhaul. The 5th Royal Tank Regiment had 23 A. 13 cruiser tanks,of which all except two had completed 1,500 miles and some over 2,000 miles.*The 6th Royal Tank Regiment were repairing and equipping themselves withItalian M. 13 tanks. The process was due for completion on the 15th April;the tanks themselves were in a bad state of repair and the drivers were unusedto handling themThis state of affairs was represented by the Brigadier in a report dated the23rd March, in the course of which he said :  &quot; Any operations carried out in the near future must be limited by the state of the vehicles .... (here followed full details of the tanks held by each Regiment). I considerthat our first aim should be to get all fighting vehicles of this Brigade Group to the standardof having at least five hundred miles in hand before time for overhaul. With less we could not carry out the role allotted, whether it be an advance or retirement involving one or morecounter-attacks.General Neame also reported on the bad state of the tanks in telegrams dated the27th March and the 1st April. There was nothing to be done about it, for noother tanks were available in the Middle East; but it seems as though the truecondition of the tanks was lost sight of in the process of reorganisation andregrouping of units of the 1st and 3rd Armoured Brigades; and that it onlybecame apparent to the Commander, 3rd Armoured Brigade, when his new forceconcentrated under him in the forward area. His report did not reach G.H.Q.until after the enemy advance had begun.From the above the reader may receive the impression that mechanical defectswere the only factor which influenced the fighting efficiency of the 2nd armoured division. This Division had not, in fact, had opportunity for adequate training as a team. It was a collection of Units, three of which had only joined shortly before the action, rather than a trained formation. The breakdown in controland administration was largely due to this fact. Again there seems no doubtthat the weakness and untrained state of the 9th Australian Division also affectedGeneral Neame&apos;s decisions. This Division, again, was only such in name. the units west of Tobruk consisted of only five Infantry Battalions, one FieldRegiment, with incomplete transport, and two Infantry Anti-tank Companiesarmed with 47-mm. Italian guns and provided with improvised transport.* The life of an A.13 engine is reckoned to be. 1,000 miles. Twelve new A.13 engines, recently arrived in Egypt, were actually in transit forward when the offensive began.
7. On the 20th March the 2nd Armoured Division relieved the 9th australian -lian Division in the forward area, the Australians withdrawing to their newpositions about Er regime-Tocra. It seems that the original intention had been to leave the 20th Australian Infantry Brigade under the Armoured Division, buton the 21st March this Brigade was also moved back and reverted to the command of its own Division.8. The original task of the 2nd Armoured Division was to prevent theenemy occupying El Agheila; but it was soon realised that this was impossibleunless a line was taken up well to the west of the town, which the scarcity oftransport did not permit. The task was therefore modified to one of patrollingwest of El Agheila, of giving early warning of an advance, and of imposing themaximum delay on an enemy advance east of El Agheila. There was no intentionof holding El Agheila or Marada. If the enemy were to advance, a delayingaction would be fought in the area of Mersa Brega; and if a serious attackdeveloped the plan was to withdraw.9. Mersa Brega itself was held by the Support Group. The position heldwas eight miles long; and though partially protected by marshes from attack byA.F.Vs., it was highly vulnerable to attack by infantry. A detachment of oneplatoon was in El Agheila itself, from which patrols of the 1st K.D.G. were operating, westwards for some eight miles and southwards to Marada. On the left of the Support Group was a five mile gap, and there, echeloned back to thenorth-east, was the 3rd Armoured Brigade, with its Headquarters midwaybetween Maaten Bettafal and Divisional Headquarters at Bir bu Gedaria.One and a half miles from the main position of the Support Group was a feature known as Cemetery Hill. Although to hold it conferred no positive advantage on the defence, since it commanded no view to the west, its captureby the enemy would allow him observation over much of the ground held by theSupport Group. This was occupied by a detachment of the 1st Tower HamletsRifles.10. During the last ten days of March, frequent contact was gained with 20th/30ththe enemy, and on the 24th March he occupied El Agheila. On the same day, air MarcLreports came in of large concentrations of enemy vehicles moving against ElAgheila, including armoured cars, tanks, artillery and M.T. Native reportsput the number of enemy troops at En Nofilia at 13,000 men and 200 tanks. Butit was still believed that he must accustom himself to desert fighting before he undertook an offensive, and that his patrolling activities were largely in the natureof training.The enemy&apos;s patrolling grew more vigorous daily. On the 25th and 26thMarch patrols of the 1st K.D.G. encountered enemy eight-wheel armoured car sand were driven in. On the 29th March, they caught and destroyed a column of enemy M.T. moving south towards Marada. There was still uncertainty thatthe enemy was present in really menacing numbers.11. It is now obvious that considerable doubt existed as to what shape thewithdrawal would take should it become necessary. The general instructions forthe Armoured Division were to withdraw gradually if attacked by superiorstrength. It was considered that this would maintain the force in being untilthe lengthening enemy communications weakened him and afforded anopportunity to strike him hard.In the absence of all documents, it is difficult to discover what was, in fact,the detailed plan of withdrawal. The following versions, taken from fourdifferent staff officers, will serve to show the divergent impressions which they had of the plans : (a) The A.A. and QM.G., 2nd Armoured Division (Col. L. S. Lloyd, M.C.) :&quot; It was expected that the enemy would follow the main road toBenghazi. The support group was to delay his advance to Agedabia,after which the 2nd Armoured Division was to protect the left flank of the 9th Australian Division, to strike the enemy&apos;s flank and harasshis L. of C.&quot;(b) G.S.O.2, 2nd Armoured Division (Maj. H. G. B. Cracroft) : &quot;The axisfor the Division^ withdrawal was Agedabia-Antelat-Er regime,and its task to protect the left flank of the 9th Australian Divisionat Er regime &quot;
(c) Commander, Support Group (Brig. H. B. Latham) :   &quot; To delay theenemy advance to Agedabia, and afterwards to retire on the axisAntelat-Sceleidima-Msus, and finally Meceqli.&quot;id) Brigade Major, 3rd Armoured Brigade (Maj. R. D. W. Uniacke) : &quot; Theplan for withdrawal was by no means cut and dried.....   To myknowledge, no line of withdrawal was ever laid down on paper, butthe dumping programme outlined in the Division&apos;s administrativeinstructions caused the impression that the Brigade axis would beAntelat -Msus-Mechili-Tmimi. &apos;&apos;As a result of further enquiry, it can now be established that two consecutiveplans were, in fact, issued; the one at the beginning of the withdrawal and theother on the 2nd April, when it was realised that the first plan could not beput into execution owing to the weakness of the 2nd Armoured Division. Inthe first plan, the 2nd Armoured Division was to withdraw on the axis Agedabia-Antelat-Msus. The enemy were to be enticed up the coastal plain north fromAgedabia and the 2nd Armoured Division based at Antelat was then to strike atthe enemy&apos;s flank and rear.By the evening of the 2nd April, it was evident that the 3rd armoured brigade was too weak to carry out the counter-attack role which had been allotted to it, and the Support Group too weak to hold the enemy frontallyabout Agedabia. and that, in consequence, the withdrawal must continue. Thesecond plan was, therefore, drawn up. There were two alternatives : to continuethe withdrawal Eastwards on the same axis as in the first plan, or to withdrawalong.the coastal plain imposing the maximum delay on the enemy. The firstcourse would open the route to Benghazi, expose the 9th Australian division to a tank attack and prejudice the successful execution of the Benghazi demolitionscheme, while the second course might lead to an early and complete exhaustion of the 2nd Armoured Division.The problem was discussed on the evening of the 2nd April by general wavell and General Neame. and the second course adopted by them. The SupportGroup was to cover the evacuation of Benghazi while the remainder of the division withdrew through Sceleidima to El Abiar to cover the left flank of the9th Australian Division.The order to put this into effect was issued at 8.50 p.m. on the 2nd April.At 3.35 a.m. on the 3rd April a message was received from the 2nd armoured division to the effect that, owing to the weakness of the 1st Battalion, TowerHamlets, it was impracticable to block the coastal road and that, through forceof circumstances, the Division was already committed to a withdrawal throughSceleidima to El Abiar in order that it might be reorganised.This explains the reason for the change of plan and accounts for the differingopinions which were based on memory as given above. The versions of theCommander of the Support Group and the AA.Q.M.G. refer to the first plan,that of the G.S.O. 2 to the second. It is clear that a definite plan did exist,so that the opinion expressed, that the plan did not take into account the mechanical state of the tanks of the Division, does not now hold. Whether theplan reached all lower formations remains doubtful. The withdrawal of theSupport Group through Antelat-Sceleidima described below (paras. 16, 18and 21). is in accordance with the second plan. The reason for the change indirection of the 3rd Armoured Brigade&apos;is given later (para. 22).3ist March 12.   Early on the 31st March patrols of the 1st K.D.G. found and engaged fiveenemy tanks advancing from El Agheila south of the main road; while anotherpatrol of the 5th R.T.R., which had gone out to look for trouble among enemypatrols on the road itself, returned and reported having damaged two out of tenenemy tanks. By 8 a.m. the 1st K.D.G. reported that the enemy was advancing insome strength both along the main road and south round the Seghir salt-marsh, led by armoured cars, light tanks and motor-cycle combinations. Carrier patrols of the1st T.H.R. were driven back on to Cemetery Hill, where the detachment holdingit was already thinning out; but at 11 a.m. they were subjected to a heavy attack by dive-bombers, and the enemy were on the hill by noon. The possessionof this enabled him to shell the left flank of the 1st T.H.R. and also to reconnoitrethe ground by observation, in addition to the reconnaissances already beingcarried out by A.F.Vs.20fch/30thMarch.
At 7 p.m., after another heavy dive-bombing attack, the enemy launched his 3ist March,infantry. For some time the right of the 1st T.H.R. was in danger of beingoverrun, but a spirited counter-attack by the carriers restored the situation. Theenemy made no attempt to continue fighting after dark, and the Support Groupextricated itself and withdrew according to plan. The 3rd Armoured Brigade,apart from drawing in its forward patrols, made no change in its dispositionson that night.13. At 7-30 a.m. on the 1st April tactical reconnaissances reported enemy 1st April,columns on both sides of the road, between El Agheila and Mersa Brega. at about noon, the Support Group retired still further northwards, the 3rd armoured brigade conforming. During the afternoon, both suffered two heavy dive-bombing attacks, and the Command Armoured Communication Vehicle of the 3rdArmoured Brigade was knocked out.The Support Group was now some eight miles East of Mersa Brega, andthe 3rd Hussars and the 5th R.T.R. on a line running from Gtafia north-west to the main road.14.   During the day, the G.O.C.-in-C, Cyrcom, visited the 2nd armoured division, and gave the Division certain tasks.   Only one account of these ordersexists,* that of the G.S.O. 2, 2nd Armoured Division, which gives them as.follows : (a) To delay the enemy advance as long as possible, with the 2nd SupportGroup withdrawing astride the Benghazi road.(b) When withdrawal was necessary, the axis for the Division was Agedabia-Antelat Er regime (see paragraph 11 (b) above).(c) As the enemy advanced up the main road to Benghazi, to harass their right flank.(d) To protect the left flank of the 9th Australian Division, which rested onEr regime.The same evening the G.O.C.-in-C, Cyrcom, reported to G.H.Q. that he proposed to counter-attack with the Armoured Brigade north of Agedabia whenopportunity afforded, and when he was certain that the enemy would make no effort by the desert route. This he considered unlikely, but he deduced from airreports that there was enough M.T. west of Agheila to make it possible thatthere was another colonial armoured division, although he believed it to be themaintenance echelons of the division with which he was already engaged. after giving details of the bad mechanical state of the 3rd Armoured Brigade, he statedhis opinion that that formation as such would be fit for one battle action only,even if avoiding the main body of enemy A.F.Vs. He judged that, failing suchaction, he must give up Benghazi, which he estimated to be the enemy&apos;s objective.A reply was sent that evening warning him that he could expect no rein-forcement in tanks for at least three weeks, and instructing him to keep the3rd Armoured Brigade intact unless he could be sure of a counter-attacksucceeding, even if such inaction meant the loss of Benghazi.15. Early on the 2nd April, the scout platoons of the 1st T.H.R. gave 2nd Aprilwarning of an armoured battalion three miles west of the right flank of theSupport Group, and also of an infantry advance in strength, escorted by tanks,along the main road. The Commander, Support Group, urged an immediatecounter-attack by the 3rd Armoured Brigade from the east, but although this wouldseem to have been in accordance with the spirit of the orders of the G.O.C.-in-C, Cyrcom, no action was taken. Again, in the light of after events and of the growing rate of casualties from mechanical breakdown, this counterstroke mighthave been justified. At 10-30 a.m., the expected attack came in, supported byA.F.Vs. Eight tanks cut across the rear of the right company of the 1st T.H.R..which was cut off together with other sub-units&quot;supporting it; but the enemyappeared to have a very limited objective, on which he halted, and the bulk of the battalion succeeded in getting away. In an effort to extricate the missingcompany, the Commander, Support Group, appealed direct to the Commander. 3rdArmoured Brigade, Divisional H.Q. having withdrawn beyond radio-telegraphyrange to Antelat. The 3rd Hussars were despatched ^south-westwards, butencountered a superior force of enemy tanks, and withdrew.* The account given in this paragraph is to some, extent modified by the new information igiven above at the end of paragraph 11.   It appears to be a combination of both plans. !
2nd April. At 3 p.m. enemy A.F.Vs. came in suddenly along the whole front of theSupport Group&apos;s new position in such numbers that they overran the whole line;but again their objective seemed limited and the units were able to extricatethemselves without heavy loss. The 5th R.T.R., however, who became engaged, lostfive cruiser tanks.16. The Support Group was now ordered to fall back to Antelat, wherethey laagered for the night. The G.S.O. 2, 2nd Armoured Division, states that theywere to withdraw via Beda Fomm, so as to lure the enemy up the main road.*Although his B Echelon vehicles did move via Beda Fomm. the Commander,Support Group, makes no mention of this order; but records that owing to a failure, through lack of time, to police a crossroads, some vehicles did, in fact, takethe main road after Beda Fomm and continued to El Abtar and Barce.Fighting on this day had been extremely fierce, and both the 1st T.H.R.,especially its Scout platoons, and J Battery, R.H.A., had distinguished themselves.There was no further interference by the enemy that night.3rd April. 17.   The 3rd April was a day of mischances, misunderstandings and counter-orders. These served to magnify the slight confusion, which was the naturaloutcome of the previous day&apos;s fighting, into a serious degree of disorder, although no contact of importance was made with the enemy throughout the day.In virtue of the first plan to allow the enemy to advance up the main road,while the 2nd Armoured Division harassed him from the East two principaldumps had been formed on the desert track. These were located at Msus andMechili. It was recognised that the supply of an armoured division by a system ofdumps does much to cramp its style, and to limit its power of manoeuvre; but lackof transport was acute, and there was no alternative. The clump at Msus wasguarded by one company of Free French Marines; that at Mechili was not yetguarded, but the Indian Motor Brigade was proceeding there, and was due toarrive.on the 4th April. The existence of these dumps and the anxiety that theycaused had a marked bearing on the operations.18. On the morning of the 3rd April the Support Group moved to Sceleidima,and the 3rd Armoured Brigade to an area just south of it. At 12-15 p.m.H.Q., 2nd Armoured Division (both advanced and rear), H.Q., 2nd SupportGroup, and H.Q., 3rd Armoured Brigade, were all at Sceleidima. The G.O.C.had gone to Msus to meet the G.O.C.-in-C, Cyrcom, but the meeting was cancelledand never took place. In his absence orders were received from Cyrcom to take up a position on the Sceleidima escarpment, covering the approaches toSceleidima and overlooking Benghazi. The northern half of this position wasallotted to the Support Group, the southern to the 3rd Armoured Brigade, and thenature of the tasks allotted necessitated a regrouping of units between the two.The 3rd Armoured Brigade, having arrived first, was already moving out to take up its new positions when the G.O.C. returned, and held a conference at 2 p.m., togive out the detailed orders.*19. Just as the conference was about to break up, or, according to someaccounts, after it had actually dispersed, a tactical reconnaissance report wasreceived which stated that enemy A.F.Vs. were moving towards Msus. Thisconstituted a threat not only to the dump, but also to the desert track to Mechili.As it was imperative to hold Msus, the previous orders (which the 3rd armoured brigade was already putting into effect) were cancelled and a new groupingordered. The Support Group, with the addition of the 6th R.T.R. (consisting of only two squadrons hastily armed with captured Italian M. 13 tanks), was to takeover the whole line of the escarpment. The 3rd Armoured Brigade, reinforced byone company of M.Gs., one company of Free French Marines, two guns of 16thInfantry Anti-Tank Company and other sub-units, was ordered to Msus.In point of fact, the so-called enemy A.F.Vs. moving on Msus were a patrolof the Long-Range Desert Group and the 3rd Armoured Brigade Recovery Section,but this was not established for another twenty-four hours. A later air reconnais-sance, at 6.30 p.m. on the same day, estimated the &quot;enemy&quot; force at Msus at100 tanks and M.T.t* This withdrawal was in accordance with the second plan. See above, new information atthe end of paragraph 11.t The primary causes of this misleading information were that the pilots were only partiallytrained, and that the system of the air to ground signals from reconnaissance aircraft wasineffective.
20. The confusion consequent on this new change of plan made itself felt: 3rd apnl-at once. The 3rd Armoured Brigade was already taking up the positions previouslyallotted to it, and the Brigade 2nd-in-Command, who had been its representative at the conference, spent considerable time looking for its new H.Q. A mass oftransport was moving northwards : the 1st R.H.A. had moved out to take up its position, and had become out of touch; none of the extra sub-units detailed to the brigade in the new orders turned up at the rendezvous. The Brigade was juststarting to move without them, when a report arrived (no doubt the 6.30 p.m.tactical reconnaissance report mentioned above) that the enemy was already inMsus.21. Meanwhile, the Support Group had failed to find any track up theescarpment, and had discovered that, in addition to the impossibilities of supply,the escarpment afforded very poor positions. This discovery led to an order at p.m. to retire on Er regime; and later, possibly on receiving the &quot; confirmation &quot;that the enemy was in Msus, the order was extended to include the 3rd armoured brigade.* The B Echelons of the Brigade moved off, while the remainder of the brigade stayed behind to search for the lost sub-units. During this search,the 6th R.T.R., the 1st T.H.R., some French Infantry and some NorthumberlandFusiliers, all of whom should have accompanied the Support Group, were foundstill about Sceleidima and without orders. The 1st R.H.A. was never foundand, in fact, was never again in contact with the 3rd Armoured Brigade.22.   During the night the K.D.G., who had started northwards with ^d/ithDivisional HQ. and the Support Group, and part of the B Echelons returned &quot; pn &apos;and reported that they were unable to get through to Er regime.    BrigadierRimington therefore decided to take all the troops which he had located under his command and make for Msus at first light.23. Divisional Headquarters and the Support Group were meanwhilemaking their way northwards; but their move was held up for many hours by abad traffic jam at the crossing of the Wadi-el-Gattara, which was not cleareduntil after dawn on the 4th. During the delay here, the Commander, Support Group,noticed several units and sub-units involved in the confusion which he knew shouldhave been with the 3rd Armoured Brigade. He also got into wireless touch withthe 1st T.H.R. and ordered them to move at once to El Abiar; but he was informed that they had been placed under the orders of the 3rd armoured brigade. It does not appear in actual fact that they were ever so placed, but thatthe Commander, 3rd Armoured Brigade, took command of the situation and of alltroops geographically near him in an effort to prevent worse confusion, andmarched them off with him to Msus.24. In order to illustrate the situation as it was known to H.Q., Cyrcom, onthe night the 3rd/4th April, the following telegram, despatched from Cyrcomto Middle East Headquarters at 12-43 a.m. on.the 4th April, is quoted in full.It shows the full effect of the misleading information about Msus. It must beremembered that at the time it was written Cyrcom was in ignorance of the3rd Armoured Brigade&apos;s failure to follow up the main line of retreat northwards.&quot; Enemy armoured and mobile forces advanced north and north-east from Agedabiato-day, and air reconnaissance 6-80 p.m. confirmed presence of enemy force estimated at100 tanks and M.T. at Msus.&quot; Weak effective strength 2nd Armoured Division made it impossible to check enemyadvance or prevent occupation Msus. 2nd Armoured Division therefore continued withdrawaleast of Antelat-Sceleidima escarpment, whence march is being continued through9th Australian Division to El Abiar.&quot; Benghazi was evacuated and demolitions completed without loss or interference.Presence enemy mobile force Msus and very few A.F.Vs. available 2nd Armoured Divisionhas rendered position 9th Australian Division untenable. Intention therefore is to withdraw to general line Wadi Derna-Mechili, but lack of A.F.Vs. makes it impossible to guarantee that further withdrawal may not be necessary to ensure security of force. 3rd Indian Motor -Brigade, less one Regiment and with 3rd Australian Anti-Tank Regiment under command,now on move to Mechili to stop any enemy advance by desert route from Msus.2nd Armoured Division will continue withdrawal and join 3rd Motor Brigade in Mechili areawith view to formation most effective mobile force that area.&quot; 9th Australian Division with 1st K.R.R.C.I under command will withdraw to positioncovered by Wadi Derna.   Withdrawal will begin night of 3rcl/4th April, and will continue on* This withdrawal was in accordance with the second plan. See above, new information at jthe end of paragraph 11. ;i The 1st K.R.R.C. had been proceeding by the coast road to the forward area; but the news of the enemy offensive had caused it to be retained under command of the 9th Australian Division.

Enemy force Msus will be kept under observation byarmoured car patrols. H.Q., Gykenaica, closing 3 a.m., 4th April, opening Mabaua samehour and moving later to Tmimi. No estimate of casualties days fighting yet available, but some units of 2nd Armoured Division have become scattered and disorganised in the courseof the withdrawal in face of very superior forces, making it essential that the formation have time for reorganisation, maintenance and replacements of A.E.Vs. before risking furtherengagement. Maximum effective A.F.Vs. strength reported 11-20 a.m., 3rd April, 12 cruisers,26 M.13s and IS light tanks.&quot;4th April. 25.   At first light on the 4th April, the 3rd Armoured Brigade, including the1st T.H.R. and all the other units and sub-units which it had taken over duringthe night, left for Msus. They experienced a short bombing attack, but otherwisecompleted the journey without incident. At Msus they found no enemy, butdiscovered that the dump, on which they were relying for fuel, had been destroyed the previous evening as a result of the false air information, and theguard of Free French Marines had withdrawn. Only 250 gallons of petrol were found intact. They reported to the 2nd Armoured Division, and spent the rest ofthe day some ten miles east of Msus waiting for orders. In the evening they weredive-bombed, and suffered serious loss in vehicles.The Brigade Major, 3rd Armoured Brigade, describes the condition of the wireless throughout the Brigade from this day onwards as &quot;chronic.&quot; Onaccount of the continual movement of the last four days, as well as heavy casualties to vehicles carrying spare batteries, no opportunity for charging batteries had occurred.  Brigade H.Q. had only one set which could be considered as workable.In default of orders, the 3rd Armoured Brigade remained for the night in its position ten miles east of Msus.26. Meanwhile, during the early hours of 4th April, both Divisional H.Q.and H.q., Support Group, had arrived at El Abiar, the former at 2 a.m. and thelatter at 8.30 a.m. It was found that, apart from one battalion astride the roadat Er&quot;regime, the 9th Australian Division had fallen back to Barce. In point of fact, the decision had already been taken (partly on account of the false reportconcerning Msus) to withdraw that division to the line of the Wadi Derna, thefirst good defensive position to the eastward.At 6 p.m. the G.S.O. 1, 9th Australian Division, reported that the australian -lian Battalion at Er regime had been heavily attacked and that several tanks had broken through. One troop of the 1st R.H.A. was sent back to cope with this threat,while Divisional H.Q. and the Support Group were ordered to Maraua. It was apparent that, what with the numerous vehicles of Divisional H.Q., the troopof R.H.A. and the trucks of the Australian battalion from Er regime, the roadthrough Barce would be extremely crowded. The Commander, Support Group,therefore decided to move by the road Sciomar-Bu Gassel, except for the 104thR.H.A., which was extremely exhausted and which he judged it better to spareanother cross-country drive by night. Divisional II.q. reached Maraua at 3 a.m.on the 5th, while the Support Group reached Bu Gassel about 8.30 a.m.5th April. 27.   At 4 a.m. on the 5th, one hour after Divisional H.Q. had got in, theBrigadier, General Staff, Cyrcom, arrived, and gave orders for the Division totake up a position about Sciomar, on the left of the 1st K.R.R.C. The DivisionalCommander fixed a rendezvous with his two commanders for 1 p.m., but theCommander, 3rd Armoured Brigade, failed to arrive. General Gambier-Parryremained with the Commander, Support Group, until 3.30 p.m., and then left him the orders for the 3rd Armoured Brigade. There was an anxious period during the afternoon, when enemy forces from El Abiar were in contact with outlying postsof the 1st K.R.R.C. and the Support Group; but guns of the 1st R.H.A. keptthem well out from the line, and in due course the leading elements of the 3rd jArmoured Brigade arrived from the south and took up its position on the leftof the Support Group.28. The 3rd Armoured Brigade had had a difficult day. They were extremelyshort of petrol and, until the afternoon, without orders. Colonel Fanshawe,the 2nd-in-command of the Brigade, who was bringing both, lost the petrol lorriesas the result of a determined enemy bombing attack near El Charruba, whichblew them up. In default of orders, the Brigadier had decided to withdraw toMechili, where he knew there was petrol. But the orders which ColonelFanshawe brought told him to move northwards, to take his place in the line whichhad been formed about Bu Gassel.  This he had barely enough petrol to do; and,
in fact, the 8th R.T.R. had to abandon all such M. 13 tanks as they had not 5th April,i   already lost through mechanical breakdown.   The Brigadier complied with theorder, but in accordance with his previous plans he had already sent hisB Echelons to Mechilt to fill up.29. Another false air report occurred on the evening of the 5th April,* whentactical reconnaissance reported an enemy move northward from Msus. Cyrcomwas deceived into ordering an immediate renewal of the general withdrawal, buton being informed by Divisional H.Q. of the true facts they withdrew the order.Several bombing attacks took place during the day, and all formationssuffered loss in vehicles, especially in petrol-carrying vehicles, at which the enemymade a dead-set.30. The morning of the 6th April passed without incident and without 6th Apj-n.activity on the part of the enemy. Divisional Headquarters were in the neighbour-hood of Got Derva, those of the 3rd Armoured Brigade South of El Charrubaand those of the Support Group near Sciomar. The Support Group refuelled inthe morning, and moved slowly down to Tecasis ; but this appears to have been a mistake, as General Neame himself encountered them, and directed them back onto the area Bu Gassel. On arriving there the Commander, Support Group, found the O.C., 1st K.R.R.C., and learned from him that the 9th Australian Divisionwere evacuating Barce and moving to Slonta. The 1st K.R.R.C. were to conform.Towards evening the Support Group also began to withdraw, through Slonta andMaraua, refuelling at Makaua. The rearguard, which consisted of the 1st T.H.R.and J Battery, R.H.A., reached Maraua at 11-30 p.m. The Derna road wascrammed with vehicles, and those of the Support Group kept their place in theline all night until at Giovanni Berta they turned off the road for a rest and sometea.   This was their second consecutive night of continuous driving.31. Meanwhile, the 3rd Armoured Brigade were still stationary from lack of petrol, and the Brigadier went to Divisional Headquarters to explain the positionand to get orders. While there, he received a message from his Brigade to saythat they had managed to find a little petrol and were partially refilled. TheBrigadier was warned that Divisional Headquarters and his Brigade would shortlymove to Mechili, to make contact with the Indian Motor Brigade there, and thus to form the &quot;most effective mobile force&quot; referred to in Cyrcom&apos;s telegramalready quoted.32. At midday a tactical reconnaissance reported enemy movement fromMsus towards Mechili. Divisional Headquarters started to withdraw there atonce, and ordered the Brigadier, 3rd Armoured Brigade, to follow with all available tanks. The Brigadier got back to his Brigade with these orders at about p.m. ; but at the same time a message was received from the B Echelons, who hadbeen sent the previous day to seek petrol at Mechili, that they were East ofGot Derva, that Mechili was surrounded and that they had been unable to getany petrol. This message actually came from the O.C., Divisional Signals, whohad discovered the vehicles there, and who reported further that he was unable tocommunicate with Divisional Headquarters.33. At 7-30 p.m. Cyrcom wirelessed orders for the 3rd Armoured Brigadeto go to Mechili, but received the reply &quot; Impossible to carry out your orders.Moving to Maraua.&quot; The Brigadier considered he had insufficient petrol for the move to Mechili and hoped to find it at Maraua, where he understood there wasa dump. He also ordered his B Echelon vehicles there. There was no sign of petrol at Maraua. The Brigadier then seems to have decided that the only wayto get to Mechili was to make for Giovanni Berta and Derna in the hopes of- finding petrol, and to make for Mechili afterwards. A rallying point was fixed1 south of Derna, where tanks were to rendezvous under Lieutenant-ColonelPetherick, 3rd Hussars.Lieutenant-Colonel D. McCorquodale, O.C., K.D.G., who met the Brigadierabout this time, was ordered by him to conform to this move. He checked this order with Divisional Headquarters, with which he was still in touch by wireless,and, receiving approval, moved off accordingly.* See second footnote on p. S, for the causes of the inaccurate Air Reports; j
Night 6th/7th 34. From this point, accounts of the 3rd Armoured Brigade becomeApril. extremely confused.   The Derna road was crowded with transport, and unitsbecame hopelessly intermingled. The 6th R.T.R. had already ceased to exist; the3rd Hussars were scattered, though portions of them finally reached Tobruk orthe frontier; and of the 5th R.T.R. only six tanks are known to have reachedDerna.Further confusion was caused by premature rumours that the Derna roadhad been cut, with the results that many units and unattached vehicles werediverted on to other routes, mostly on to the track Giovanni Berta-Martub.Partly in consequence of this, after dawn on the 7th April, the density of traffic on the road greatly eased, until the edge of the escarpment was reached, justwest of Derna. Here some lorries were trying to evacuate stores from anabandoned Detail Issue Depot and a jam was caused which stretched into themiddle of the town.7th April. 35.   The Commander, Support Group, reached Derna about 8 a.m. andcleared the traffic block. As soon as the flow of traffic began again, a small enemyforce, which was afterwards found to consist of one gun on a lorry, three trucksand an armoured car, tried to force its way on to the aerodrome. It was engagedand driven westward and there kept at arm&apos;s length by the 1st R.H.A., but it remained in position, luckily just out of range of the road, and continued shellingfor the rest of the morning. For about two minutes, also, some Messerschmittsappeared and machine-gunned the road, but made off again without causingappreciable damage.36: At 10 a.m., the K.D.G. arrived in good order, having succeeded in keeping together throughout the night. They were still intending to move to therendezvous ordered by the Commander, 3rd Armoured Brigade, on the previous evening with a view to moving to Mechili. Shortly after they arrived, theBrigadier called them up on the wireless set of B Squadron, their own rearsquadron, saying that he had lost all his Brigade transport. The O.C., K.D.G.,asked if he was still to go to the rendezvous, and was told instead to proceed toTmimi. This is the last record of contact being made with the Commander,3rd Armoured Brigade.37. At 11 a.m. the flow of vehicles out of Derna had almost ceased, andthe Brigadier, Support Group, sent all his units down the road towards Bomba,with the exception of the rear guard, which still consisted of the 1st T.H.R. andJ Battery, R.H.A. These remained in position on the top of the western escarp-ment. But soon after the move had begun, part of the 319th Battery (104thRH.A.) came on to the main road from the West and the Brigade TransportOfficer from the Mechili track, both reporting contact with the enemy. TheCommander, Support Group, therefore ordered the rearguard to retire quickly,before they were finally surrounded.The leading company of the rearguard, with one troop of J Battery, R.H.A..crossed the aerodrome safely, but the second company was attacked by tanks and anti-tank guns advancing from the West. In the spirited fight which followed.J Battery and a Bofors gun which had been posted on the escarpment knockedout sixteen enemy tanks, while the last four cruiser tanks of the 5th R.T.R. joinedto help the infantry through. Unfortunately many of the trucks of the rearcompanies were forced off the road towards the coast and failed to get away;although tactical reconnaissances reported them late that evening still strugglingsouth-eastwards.   Only one of the cruiser tanks survived.Night 38.   The remainder of the Support Group and the K.D.G. arrived at Tobruk7th/8th April. at 10-30 p.m. and 1 a.m. respectively on night the 7th/8th April, passing-through outposts of the 9th Australian Division at Ain El Gazala. They hadretired close on 450 miles in eight days without losing a gun.Night 39.   H.Q., 2nd Armoured Division, arrived at Mechili at midnight the8th/7th Apni. (jth/7th April, and took over command of the troops already there. The IndianMotor Brigade had arrived there at 2 p.m. on the 4th April, having suffered somecasualties to personnel and vehicles from air attack on the way. Until the after-noon of the 6th April, they had been able to build a perimeter, dig defences and increase the dump of supplies and fuel by means of convoys from Tobrukwithout interference. On the morning of the 6th April, a squadron ofthe 18th Cavalry reported having twice encountered enemy south of Mechili.
At 2 p.m. on the 6th, enemy guns came into position two thousand yards southof the camp, and shelled it for an hour with little effect. Enemy infantry began to move round the flank; but a vigorous sortie was made and prisoners captured.Soon after dark there was some high-level bombing, and immediately afterwardsthe leading elements of H.Q., 2nd Armoured Division, began to arrive.40.   The force in Mechili consisted of the following :  H.Q., 2nd Armoured Division.3rd Indian Motor Brigade (Brigadier Vaughan).H.Q. and one Squadron, Divisional Signals.1st and 37th Light A.A. Batteries, R.A., and elements of :4th Field Squadron, R.E.143rd Field Park Troop. R.E.2nd Armoured Divisional R.A.S.C.3rd Light Field Ambulance.There were also some B Echelon vehicles of the 3rd Armoured Brigade andthe Support Group, and a small party of the 1st R.H.A. who were on their way up from back areas trying to rejoin their unit. This party arrived during theaction on the afternooon of the 6th.Throughout the 7th April the enemy made minor attacks which were easilybeaten off, the defence capturing a number of prisoners. Two separate demands for surrender were made by the enemy, one signed by the German corps commander. Both were treated with contumely; but unfortunately the officerbringing one of them was not blindfolded while being conducted through the defences, with the result that the enemy artillery fire became much more deadlyafter his return. At 5 p.m. orders were received from Cyrcom to withdraw toEl Adem, and a plan was prepared for an attempt at first light on the 8th.A Squadron of the 18th Cavalry and some A.F.Vs. were to make a feint againstthe enemy guns east of the camp, while the main body burst out to the southwards.An officer with petrol lorries was sent to try and break out to the West in thefaint hope of finding the remnants of the 3rd Armoured Brigade and adding themto the column, but it is not known what happened to him. In any case, the3rd Armoured Brigade was by then in an equally precarious situation.The attempt to break out at dawn on the 8th April failed. The cruiser tankleading the feint was late in starting, and was then knocked out by the secondshell. The others fared no better. The main southern column started at 7.15 a.m.,but came under a withering fire from artillery and machine guns. The G.O.C.,2nd Armoured Division, considered that H.Q. personnel in open vehicles wereunsuited to run the gauntlet of fire. After unsuccessful attempts had been madeto break out south, west and north, he gave permission for individual partiesto get away themselves if they could, and put up a white flag out of his CommandArmoured Communication Vehicle.Various parties, shewing great resource and initiative, managed to get away.One party of 50, consisting mainly of the detachment of the 1st R.H.A. and someIndian troops, reached Sollum on the 11th April. Another of the 18th Cavalry,with sixty vehicles, joined forces with part of an Australian Anti-Tank Regimentwith ten guns, which they encountered south-east of Mechili, and reachedSollum at midnight on 11th/12th April. This party met two Australianbattalions and a full squadron of the 18th Cavalry in action at Acroma andfought their way back with them through El Adem.

The mechanical defects of A.F.Vs. of the 3rd Armoured Brigade, and inparticular among the cruiser tanks of the 5th R.T.R.2. The shortage of transport, which tied the Division to dumps, with all the inevitable anxieties which their existence entailed.3. The false air reports on the 3rd April about the enemy being at Msus.4. The frequent changes of orders and regrouping consequent on these airreports, which resulted in the disintegration of formations and units.5. The failure of petrol supply, due to the decision to change the line of withdrawl.6. The complete breakdown of signal communication, partly due to loss of vehicles and partly to lack of opportunities of charging batteries.
7. Lack of tactical reconnaissances, particularly in the latter stages.8. Lack of topographical knowledge, and the consequent failure to appreciate that the Sceleidima escarpment afforded neither good positions norgood tracks.Note.General Wavell has made it clear in his telegram that he does not intend hisadditional notes to minimise mistakes, but to correct the possible interpretationthat no definite plan for the withdrawal existed, and that the force was strongerand more battleworthy than in fact it was.APPENDIX C.Note on the handling of the German forces.THE following points were noted by the Commander, Support Group, duringthe fighting on the 31st March, and are quoted from his report: (a) The reconnaissance was most thorough and at times carried out from anA.F.V.(b) The Infantry guns were brought right up to the front line, and it wasthe fire of these weapons that silenced the defence on the right.(c) Anti-tank guns also accompanied the infantry and saved him from beingcompletely overrun by our carriers&apos; counter-attack. There appearedto be no co-ordinated system of artillery fire support, though theshelling of the area in general was intensified.id) There was no &quot;do or die &apos;&apos; spirit in the infantry, who were only tooready to drop and try and work forward using folds in the ground(unlike Dunkirk).(e) No following up or pursuit of any kind; but M.Gs. mounted on fixedlines fired bursts down the main road at intervals.2.   Other points are of interest:  (a) The enemy, as has been reported from other theatres, never operated at night, except that on the 2nd April infantry carried out an approachmarch in buses before day break, which enabled them to reach the positions held by the Support Group.(b) He lost many opportunities of operating by air against M.T. columns in difficulties, e.g., at Wadi Gattara on night the 3rd/4th April, onthe Derna road on night the 6th /7th April and on the morning of 7th April. On the other hand, he used aircraft with effect againstpetrol lorries and signal vehicles on several occasions.(c) The enemy infantry, and specially tanks, were given very limitedobjectives against infantry in position, so that twice the SupportGroup was able to break off an action and withdraw without incurring undue loss.APPENDIX D.Copy of a telegram dated June 20, 1941, from the Commander-in-Chief, middle east, to the War Office, with reference to the letter covering the originalreport.(0/74859.   20/6.)REF. Crme/9209/3/G (Tng) of 11th June forwarding report on action2nd Armd. Div. during withdrawal from Cyrenaica Mar./Apr. 41. following are additions and amendments :  (A) Plan and orders for withdrawal paras. 11 and 14.(1) Now established two consecutive plans issued. First plan at beginningof withdrawal, second on 2nd April, when realized that first could not be imple-mented owing to weakness 2nd Armd. Div.   Respective plans were :  fa) First Plan. 2nd Armd. Div. to withdraw on Axis Agedabia-Antelat-Msus. Enemy to be enticed up Coastal Plain North from Agedabia. 2nd Armd.Div. based on Antelat, then to strike at flank and rear.
(&amp;) Second Plan. By evening 2nd Apr. was evident that 3rd Armd. Bde. tooweak to carry out counter-attack role and Support Gp. too weak to hold enemyfrontally about Agedabia, therefore withdrawal must continue.Alternatives open.(i) To continue withdrawal east on axis as in first plan. This would openroute to Benghazi, expose 9th Aus. Div. to tank attack and prejudice successfulexecution Benghazi demolition scheme.(ii) To withdraw along Coastal Plain imposing maximum delay on enemy.This might lead to early and complete exhaustion of 2nd Armd. Div. this problem discussed evening 2nd Apr. by C.-in-C. and Commander, Cyrcom.Course (ii) adopted. Support Group to cover evacuation Benghazi, remainderdivision to withdraw El Abiar via Sceleidima to cover left flank 9th Aus. Div.This order issued 8.50 p.m. 2nd Apr. Message was received from 2nd Armd. Div.3.35 a.m. 3rd Apr., stating that, owing to weakness 1st Tower Hamlets, impracticable-able to block coastal road and that through force of circumstances already committed to withdrawal El Abiar via Sceleidima to reorganize.(2) This explains reasons for change of plan and accounts for differingopinions, based on memory, in para, 11. Commander, Support Group, andA.A.Q.M.G. refer to first plan, G.S.O. 2 to second plan, and in para. 14 tocombination of both.(3) As it is now apparent that definite plan existed, opinion expressed in para. 11, first sub-para., last three lines, should be deleted. Whether plan reachedall lower formations is doubtful, but withdrawal of support group throughAntelat, Sceleidima, El regime, named in paras. 16, 18 and 21, respectively, isin accordance with second plan. Reason for changed direction 3rd Armd. Bde. isgiven,in para. 22.(4) Para. 17, second para., line one, delete &quot; General,&quot; substitute &quot; First.&quot;(B) Fighting strength 2nd Armd. Div. and 9th Aus. Div.(5) Para. 6, appendix B, para. 1. Report inclined to give impression thatmechanical defects only factor influenced fighting efficiency 2nd Armd. Div.; infact, division had not opportunity for adequate training as a team, and was more acollection of units, three of which only joined division shortly before action.Breakdown in control and administration largely due to this.(6) Weakness and untrained state 9th Aus. Div. also affected decision of commander, Cyrcom.
