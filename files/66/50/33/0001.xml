s/SECRET. Copy &quot;NO.  36W.P. (44) 283.30th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.BROADCASTS TO GERMANY BY A SPOKESMAN OF THESUPREME HEADQUARTERS OF THE ALLIED EXPEDITIONARYFORCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AS my colleagues may be aware, arrangements have recently been made forbroadcasts to be given to Europe by a spokesman of the Supreme headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force. I attach a copy of the draft text of sucha broadcast which was recently referred to me by Supreme Headquarters. this draft is the first of a new series of talks to Germany.2. From the point of view of our political warfare to Germany, a broad-cast on the lines of the attached draft might do good. On the other hand, thedraft raises a number of* issues of considerable political importance in which not only the United States and Soviet Governments but also our other european allies are closely interested. The whole question of plans for the occupationof Germany is still under discussion between the major Allies in the european advisory Commission. It is important that nothing should be said in thesebroadcasts which might be resented by our Allies as unduly prejudging the outcome of those discussions. For these reasons I have suggested certain cutsin the draft. Provided these bracketed portions are omitted, I think that the text might be approved.3. These broadcasts, however, raise an important question of principle. Itis in my view important that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have some meansof controlling the content of broadcasts to Germany put out over the B.B.C.on the subject of our future plans in regard to the occupation of that country.I accordingly suggest that I should be authorised to scrutinize the scripts ofthese broadcasts on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government from the political pointof view before they are issued. If my colleagues agree that I should do this, thenecessary machinery can easily and rapidly be set up to ensure that copies ofthe broadcasts are communicated to the Foreign Office in draft by the SupremeHeadquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force.4. I take this opportunity to remind my colleagues of the proposal whichI submitted to them earlier this year (W.P. (44) 125 of the 19th February last)for a joint Anglo-American-Russian pronouncement to the German people. Ifsuch a pronouncement were made, it would, of course, help to ensure that weall spoke with one voice to Germany.A. E.Foreign Office, 30th May, 1944.-  - ANNEX.Supreme. Headquarters, A Hied Expeditionary Force,Psychological Warfare Division, 9th May, 1944.Draft for a Radio Script for use in British and American GermanRadio Service.Lead-in: This concerns you. To-day you hear the first of a new series oftalks. The speaker is a member of the staff of the Supreme Commander of theAllied Expeditionary Force [and belongs to one of the sections of the staff whichis preparing the plans for the occupation of Germany].12377   [27549] ,Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.
I will not waste words, but will begin with the most difficult question- andthe most urgent for each of you. Most of you have begun to wonder what willhappen to Germany -and to each one of you and his family when Germany isdefeated. I don&apos;t say that you expect defeat; but-you sometimes wonder about it.And then you probably say: &quot;Defeat that&apos;s the end of Germany andiforusGermans.&quot; .....&apos; &apos;    &apos;Let us start with that. What will happen in Germany when the frontcollapses.? I will give you the answer as we see it, [we who are working in theSupreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force on plans for theoccupation of Germany after defeat. These plans are based on the policiesproclaimed by our Governments].First, let me say this, everything depends on what you mean by the word&quot;Germany.&quot; If you identify Germany with the present system: if you can&apos;tconceive of a Germany in which there is no Hitler, no Himmler, no Party, hoOKW : if you can only see your own personal future as a soldier:m a huge german army, or a worker in a vast German Reich then defeat for you will he the end,for this war is going to bring the end of the present system : it is going to bringthe end of a German Reich in which war is rated the highest activity, andsoldiering the only career for a real man : a Germany which, in pretence of self-defence, overruns its small neighbours twice in a generation : the end of theromantic day-dreams of the young about a world mission, fhe master race, aGerman Europe: [the end. of the material ambitions of the old for Europeancartels,] for world monopolies, for great estates in the East run by serf&apos; Slavlabour. Yes, when the three Allied Armies, British, Russian and American,march through the Brandenburger Tor it will be the end of that Germany, thefinal irrevocable end.But what about the other side1? What about the millions o  soldiers who do not give orders but obey them, who do not plan wars but fight them ? Whatabout the little man in the factory and the field and his wife and family?When the Leadership is liquidated what happens to the Followers -to the99 per cent, of Germans who just obey orders ITo that question I give a plain, soldierly answer. In the first instance,in the first phase after the defeat, the 99 per cent, of Germans who obeyorders will continue to obey orders &quot;but from a different Leadership. . Insteadof the orders of the present Leadership, you will obey the orders of the OccupyingAuthorities. [British, Russian and American. Those orders are now being agreed in detail between the three Governments.] ;Defeat will bring many harsh things to Germany. Defeats always do.But those who say that defeat will bring chaos [bolshevism], the destructionof Germany are either idiots or deliberately deceiving you. Defeat will bringan austere order to a Germany slipping already now towards chaos.:, a stern,soldierly justice to a Germany already subjected to the whims of autocraticlocal bosses. Discipline and purpose to a homeland slipping through sheerexhaustion into anarchy; * 1I tell you this because I know. One thing only, -when defeat comes, will prevent the disintegration of the German State the armies of occupation[British; Russian and American]. The time is coming when our armies will bethe only bulwark for the German people against anarchy. Our. armies are goingto occupy Germany after this war to keep order in Germany and to restore theprinciples of justice. We are going to occupy it and control it and prevent theanarchy in Germany which would be in the long run as disastrous to us as to you,and [our armies British, Russian and American are going to stay in Germanyjust so long as is necessary] to destroy the Germany^of Hitler and Himmler, ofJodl and Keitel and to make room for another Germany, a Recht Staat (i.e., aState based on law) at peace with itself and with its neighbours.So much for to-day. [Next time I will speak to you in further detail aboutthe plans for the occupation of Germany.]
