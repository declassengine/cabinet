NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Enemy shipping off the Norwegian coast has been heavily attacked bycarrier-borne aircraft. -Shipping losses during April have been exceptionally light.Four U-boats have been sunk, two probably sunk and three possibly sunk.Home Waters.2. A convoy of 44 ships from N. Russia has arrived at U.K. ports with theloss of one ship torpedoed .by U-boat.Aircraft from H.M.S. Fencer (escort carrier) probably sank one U-boatduring the passage.3. On the night of the 6th/7th, a force of M.T.Bs. was sent to destroy theElbing class destroyer aground near the lie de Vierge since the 29th April afterthe engagement with H.M. Canadian destroyers A thabaskan and Haida. One-torpedo was fired, which hit under the bridge and the destroyer is now considered a total loss.On the night of the 7th/8th, four French M.T.Bs. patrolling south ofGuernsey engaged an enemy convoy in which two heavily laden ships of1,000/2,000 tons were escorted by seven trawlers. One of the ships is claimed to have been torpedoed and sunk.On the night of the lOth/llth, M.T.Bs. were in action with enemy patrol vessels off the Dutch coast, one armed trawler being sunk and two severely damaged. All M.T.Bs. returned having suffered minor casualties and some damage.Norwegian Waters.4. On the 6th, aircraft from ELM. ships Furious and Searcher attackedtwo southbound convoys off Molde, on the Norwegian coast. Two ships, one of6,000 tons, and a tanker of 5,000 tons in ballast, were torpedoed and sunk, a ship of 2,500 tons was bombed and sunk and one of the escort vessels was also damaged by a bomb. Two enemy aircraft were shot down and two of our aircraft were lost. i5. On the 8th, aircraft from H.M. ships Emperor, Searcher and Strikerattacked a northbound enemy convoy off Kristiansund (S.W. of Trondheim). one ship was probably damaged and oil cisterns atKjeholm (N.W. of Stadlandet) were bombed. Five enemy aircraft were shot down by our aircraft, four of which are missing.North Atlantic.6. H.M.C.S. Valley field (frigate) was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat off cape Race on the 7th., H.M.C.S. Giffard picked up 35 survivors.Mediterranean.7. During the week ending the 9th, some 23,-000 tons of supplies wereunloaded at Anzio. There were two sharp air raids during the night of the2nd/3rd, and intermittent shelling on four days, but no damage to shipping hasbeen reported.8. During the U-boat hunt off Bougie on the 4th, the French destroyerSenegalais was torpedoed and towed into harbour, in addition to theU.S.S. Menges reported torpedoed last week. The U-boat was subsequentlysunk.The U.S.S. Fechteler (destroyer) was sunk by a U-boat when escorting a convoy in the western Mediterranean on the 4th. Thirty of the ship&apos;s company are missing. .A U.S. patrol craft was sunk by U-boat N.E. of Palermo on the 9th during a U-boat hunt.9. The U.S. destroyers Hilary P. Jones and Charles F. Hughes bombardedsupply dumps and assembly areas in support of the Anzio bridgehead on the 5th.IT.M. destroyers Lauderdale and Eggesford shelled the coastal road nearMaitaka (S. Albania) and Italian destroyers had a short engagement with E-boats and shore batteries south of Bar. 1 -IP
10. In the eastern Mediterranean, on the night of the 2nd/3rd, H.M.S.Ajax bombarded Rhodes town and harbour, and French destroyers bombardedKos harbour.   MX. 360 sank two caiques off Rhodes on the night of the 6th/7th.11.   The following reports from H.M. submarines have been received : Unruly, when on patrol in the ^aegean Sea in April, sank three caiques andpossibly torpedoed an escort vessel.Upstart, while on patrol off the Riviera coast, shelled an olive oil factory atOneglia, the railway near Cannes and a seaplane hangar near St. Raphael.Unsparing attacked an escorted ship off Kos on the 12th April with unknownresults.East Indies.12. H.M. S/M Tantalus between the 19th April and 3rd May shelled and sank a tug and a small coaster in the Malacca Strait and a 4,000 ton ship offPort Blair (Andaman Islands).13. The damage caused by the explosion at the Bombay docks on the14th April is reported to be less disastrous than was at first feared. Seven ships are probable total losses and eight others damaged. Repairs to the Princes andVictoria docks will take about two and six months respectively but sixteen berthsare now available.Pacific.14. The simultaneous landings at three points in the Hollandia area ofNew Guinea were carried out with the largest amphibious force which has yetbeen used in the S.W. Pacific and strong U.S. naval task forces bombarded the landing areas, neutralised enemy airfields within flying distance and covered theoperation against any attempt at intervention by the Japanese Fleet.The Japanese forces now isolated in the Wewak-Hansa Bayunlikely to be evacuated by sea.  Between the 1st and 6th May, Allied M.T.Bs.,operating off this coast and off Bougainville, have sunk barges laden with troops.Anti-Submarine Operations.15. Thirty-five attacks have been reported; of these, five were by shore-based aircraft, fifteen by carrier-borne aircraft and fifteen by warships.On the 4th, the U.S.S. Sustain and H.M.S. Blankney (destroyers) sank aU-boat off Bougie, 49 prisoners including the Captain being taken. On the 5th,in the S.W. Approaches, the 2nd Escort Group sank a U-boat, and aircraft from.M.S. Vindex sank another, prisoners being taken in both cases. Aircraft fromthe U.S.S. Block Island (escort carrier) and the U.S.S. Buckley (destroyer) alsosank a U-boat by gunfire and ramming, prisoners being taken.Swordfish from H.M.S. Fencer, escorting the convoy from N. Russia, probably sank one and possibly sank two UTboats on the 1st and 2nd.In the Biscay Wellington probably sank a U-boat on the 4th and aLiberator possibly sank another on the 3rd.Enemy Intelligence.German.16. German effective warship strength at the end of June next is likelyto be: Two pocket battleships, two 8&quot; and four 6&quot; cruisers (including Scheer,lutzow, Prinz Eugen, nurnberg, Leipzig, Emden and Hipper), two old battle-ships, 23/24 destroyers, eight Elbing class destroyers, 25/28 torpedo boats and80/90 E-boats.The former Dutch cruiser Gelderland and two former Dutch coastal defenceships have been converted into floating A.A. batteries.Three of the four British-designed corvette hulls, captured by the enemy at st.. Nazaire in 1940, are now completed and in service and the fourth is well advanced.  .[27430] B
L.C.Ts. fitted for minelaying have been seen as far west as Brest. Convertedinvasion barges have been seen in the Havre-Cherbourg area laying beachobstacles.  E-boat activity has shown a marked increase in recent weeks.17. The lutzow was sighted at Copenhagen on the 8th by photographic reconnaissance and is reported to have sailed southbound the following day. TheScheer was shown at Swinemiinde on the 9th.As a result of the explosion at Bergen on the 20th April, it is reported,29 ships were damaged, of which four were over 1,000 tons.U-boats.18. U-boat activity in the Atlantic has been slight and it is consideredthat few U-boats are at sea. Attacks are made only under favourable circumstances.Activity in other seas has been negligible.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19.   No ships have been reported sunk by enemy action during the week.Shipping losses by enemy action during April amounted to 12 ships of75,000 tons, the lowest monthly total since the war began. Marine casualties during the month, including some 32,000 tons lost as the result of an explosionat Bombay, raised the total of losses from all causes to 127,000 tons. U-boatssank eight ships (55,000 tons), all but one of them in the Atlantic. Therewere no losses during the month in the Indian Ocean. Enemy aircraft in attacks on Mediterranean convoys sank three ships (20,000 tons) and damagedthree others which reached port. Enemy mines damaged two ships in theMediterranean and one in the Thames Estuary. E-boats sank a tug in theChannel. .Protection of Seaborne Trade.20. During the week ending the 7th, 870 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 296 were in ocean convoys and 574 in British coastal convoys. One anti-aircraft ship, 44 destroyers &quot;(including 18 U.S. destroyers)and 103 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Five home-bound convoys, consisting of 236 ships, and three outward convoys,consisting of 60 ships, reached their destinations. A convoy from N. Russia,originally of 45 ships, lost one by U-boat attack.During April, 17 ocean convoys of 585 ships arrived in the United Kingdomand 17 outward-bound convoys of 698 ships reached their destinations. Twohomeward-bound convoys, originally of 65 ships, lost three by enemy action. &apos;In the Western Atlantic and Caribbean, 1,344 ships in 118 convoys reached !their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.21. Mines have, been laid off the French coast by surface craft, and aircraft have laid mines off the French, Dutch and German coasts and off the Biscay ports.Aircraft have also laid mines in the Danube, in the ^aegean Sea and in theGulf of Siam.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.22. Apart from suspected minelaying by one enemy aircraft over the Firthof Forth and one over the Firth of Tay during the night of the 5th/6th, therewere no reports of enemy minelaying during the week ending the 10th.On the 3rd, H.M.S. Elgin (minesweeper) was damaged by a mine off Portlandand was towed into harbour.  The mine totals are 4,776 ground and 4,632 moored.23. Small dangerous areas have been declared N. of the&apos; Strait of Messina,off the west coast of Italy and on the east coast of Greece.It is now known that 34 moored mines were destroyed by U.S. minesweepersin January during the landing operations at Anzio.24. In October last, enemy mines were reported in the Atlantic approaches to the Panama Canal, and it is now known that U.S. minesweepers destroyedten off Colon.
Enemy Merchant Shipping.25. German merchant shipping losses during March are now knownto have been larger than previously reported. Twenty-three ships of a totalof 55,262 tons were sunk, captured or became total losses: seven of thesesjiips, totalling 9,161 tons, were casualties in the Mediterranean. In addition14 ships of 59,173 tons in all were seriously damaged. During the first fortnightof April, the German losses were five ships totalling 14,000 tons (two of 3,000 tonsin the Mediterranean); five others of 16,302 tons were seriously damaged.26. Minelaying in the Baltic has been very effective of late and the Germanminesweeping service has been so overstrained in trying to deal with it that in places sea-traffic has had to be suspended for days on end. The ports of DanzigBay and those of Konigsberg and Pillau in East Prussia were closed for morethan a fortnight, the train-ferry between Trelleborg in Sweden and Sassnitz was interrupted on several occasions and a score of Swedish ships loaded with iron orewere detained for a week in Swedish ports before they could sail safely to theGerman ports. Swedish ship-owners in some cases have begun to lay up their ships rather than run the risk of trading with German ports in the Baltic.27. Ships engaged in the ore trade between Spain and Germany, via French ports, have again been very active this week.28. During last month, there was a considerable increase in the amountof oil exported up the Danube from Rumania. According to a report 94,000 tons were delivered in this way compared with 38,000 tons in February. Each month30,000 tons of oil were sent by rail. These figures relate only to those consignmentswhich have been observed, and bear no specific relation to the actual total ofpetroleum products exported from Rumania, but they are probably a fairindication of the increase during the last month and of the proportions of oilsent by river and overland.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Main Front.29. On the main front in Russia activity has been confined to the sectorbetween Stanislavov and Jassy. In the area south of Stanislavov the germans and Hungarians have succeeded in gaining some ground during the course oftheir recent attacks, but no fresh progress has been claimed for nearly a weekand the attacks now seem to have died down.The Germans, after their announcement on the 2nd, that the Russians hadlaunched a strong attack on a narrow front along the River Siret west of Jassy,for some days continued to report Russian pressure there, but on the 8th they stated that the defensive battle had come to an end for the time being, theRussians having failed to break through. The Russians have not mentioned anyactivity in this area.Crimea.30. In a powerful assault at Sebastopol the Russians succeeded in over-coming German and Rumanian resistance, and the city was finally captured onthe 9th. Its fall will free considerable Russian forces for use elsewhere and willenable the Russians to make much freer use of their shipping in the Black Sea.Although German propaganda is now stating that Sebastopol had lost itsstrategic value, the importance which the enemy attached to it can be judgedby the tenacity with which it was defended.Yet, hard as they have fought to keep their hold on the town, the enemy has fallen far short of the Russian achievement in 1941-42, when the Germans were held up outside Sebastopol for eight months. Even after beginning their finaloffensive against the city on the 7th June, 1942, the Germans still took four weeks to overcome the last remnants of Russian resistance. The Russians on their parthave taken barely five weeks to overrun the whole of the Crimea.[27430] b.2
Italy.31. The principal news from Italy this week is of an enemy withdrawal inthe mountainous area between Casoli and Castel di Sangro. This withdrawalwas first reported on the 9th, when patrols of a special force found Palena clearof the enemy. Observation posts were established on the outskirts of the village,and the follow up after the enemy continued vigorously. The following day our forces again went forward, though without contact. The latest position is thatwe hold Palena and a portion of the road running north to Lama, but this roadhas been heavily blown by the enemy and is impassable to wheeled vehicles. our positions south of Palena are uncertain, as the whole area is only held by patrols,but our forward elements are probably just to the east of the road from thatvillage to Castel di Sangro.Greater activity than of late has been noted on the main Fifth Army front,along the lower reaches of the Garigliano.In the&apos; bridgehead, there has been some spirited small scale activity,especially in the area S.W. of Cisterna, where several raids have been carriedout by troops of a U.S. formation. -Yugoslavia.32. The Partisans have overcome the strong drive launched by the germans in East Bosnia; and have recaptured several towns, driving back a Germancolumn from Vlasenica (35 miles N.E. of Sarajevo). They have also repulsedthe attacks which the Germans had made in the area S.E. of Ljubljana.Indecisive fighting has taken place in Montenegro and in other parts of yugoslavia.Greece.33. A German drive in the area of Mount Pajko (45 miles N.W. ofSalonica) has met with slight E.L.A.S. resistance.Burma.A arakan.34. On the night the 6th/7th, our forces evacuated Buthidaung inaccordance with the plan for withdrawal to monsoon dispositions. They nowoccupy positions about 3 miles west of Buthidaung. Further attacks against our positions in the Maungdaw area have been repulsed.Chin Hills and Chindwin.35. Three miles east of Bishenpur an attack made by our troops supportedby tanks on the 8th has had some success. Japanese attacks in the Palel area havebeen repulsed. -Advancing from Imphal, our forces have reached a point 18 miles N.N.E.of the town, and have made some progress.On the 5th, British troops launched an attack in the vicinity of Kohima.This has made some progress S.W. of the town, but the Japanese are resisting in strength.New Guinea. ,36. In the Hollandia area U.S. forces made two further unopposed landings,one on the 2nd at Wari (on the coast half-way between Tanahmerah Bay andHumboldt Bay), and the other at Demta (12 miles west of Tanahmerah Bay).Patrols moving eastwards from Humboldt Bay have reached another Japaneseairfield under construction at the mouth of the Tami River (10 miles east ofHumboldt Bay). On the night the 27th/28th April, the enemy launched, an unsuccessful attack against the perimeter of Hollandia airstrip.New Britain.37. Allied troops have occupied Cape Hoskins airfield (25 miles east of the&quot;Willaumez Peninsula) without opposition, continuing their advance along thenorth coast.   They are now approximately 150 miles from Rabaul.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. The offensive on the Western Front was intensified. Heavy attacks were made at night on transportation targets and airfields. By day Berlin was bombed on two occasions and operations against communications and cross-Ohannel defence systems were widespread and powerful.In Italy road and railway bridges were successfully attacked. Allied heavy bombers attacked Bucharest, Ploesti and other targets in the Balkans.United Kingdom.39. No enemy operations of any importance were directed against thiscountry. Enemy reconnaissances were flown off the South Coast and off theScottish anchorages.Home Waters.40. Beaufighters sank an E-boat off Cherbourg, damaged one 3,000-ton ship and probably sank a second off Borkum and set fire to four ships totalling 11,500tons in the same area. Other promising attacks were carried out, though definiteresults were not seen.One-hundred-and-eighty-three aircraft of Bomber Command laid 510sea-mines along enemy shipping lanes between the Frisians and the Biscay ports.Western Front.41. Despite bad weather early in the week, nearly 20,000 tons of bombs were dropped in attacks on targets in Germany, France, Belgium and Luxemburg.Bomber Command flew 2,774 sorties at night, while, in daylight, aircraft of theUnited States Eighth and Ninth Air Forces and of the Allied Expeditionary A irForce made over 16,000 flights on offensive operations. Totals of 117 bombers and 50 fighters are missing. Enemy losses in combat were 149 destroyed, 24probably destroyed and 47 damaged; 17 more were destroyed on the ground.Germany.42. Two heavy attacks on Berlin* were made in daylight. Fortresses,bombing by instruments through cloud, dropped 1,290 tons on the 7th and 796 tonson the following day. Few enemy fighters were seen on the first operation,but ground defences were active; eight Fortresses did not return. On the second attack there was again considerable flak and numerous German fighters came up,of which 18 were shot down; 25 Fortresses were lost. Liberators attackedOsnabriick (400 tons), munster (368 tons) and Brunswick (789 tons); fierce airbattles over Brunswick resulted in the destruction of 89 enemy fighters for theloss of 11 Allied bombers and 14 fighters.At night Mosquitoes dropped a total of 120 tons at Ludwigshafen, and about35 tons each on Berlin, Osnabruck and Leverkiisen.*France and Occupied Territories.43. (a) Marshalling yards. At night, aircraft of Bomber Commandattacked Mantes/Gassicourt (600 tons),* Lens (530 tons), Courtrai (530 tons),Haine St. Pierre, near Mons (450 tons),* and Ghent (420 tons). By day, Liege(280 tons),* Mezieres (160 tons), Brussels (145 tons), Luxemburg (120 tons) andThionville (81 tons) were among the many railway centres bombed, several being attacked more than once; a total of 1,250 tons of bombs was released; in additionto the heavy bomb tonnage 1,000 R.Ps were fired.(b) Bridges and locks. About 370 tons of bombs were dropped and over900 RPs. were fired at railway-bridges, waterways, locks and similar objectives.The bridge at Vernon-on-Seine was demolished and hits were made on otherbridges in the Havre and Rouen areas and on Gisors viaduct; Long Lock bridge,near Boulogne, was probably destroyed.(c) Airfields. On the night 7th/8th, Lancasters attacked airfields at Nantes(430 tons),* and, on the following night, dropped 305 tons on the airfield andseaplane base at Brest/Lanveoc,*   Daylight attacks, during which 1,250 tons of
bombs were dropped, were made on 15 airfields, including Laon (384 tons),St. Trond (200 tons),* Florennes (180 tons), St. Dizier (124 tons),* Juvincourt(120 tons), Thionville (105 tons) and Bergen/Alkmaar, near Amsterdam (100tons).*(d) Ordnance depots. On the night 6th/7th aircraft of Bomber Commanddropped 384 and 267 tons, respectively, on ammunition dumps at Sable-sur-Sarthe* and Aubigne-Racon* (both 25 miles south of Le Mans). On the following night, similar objectives at Bruz (near Rennes)* and Salbris (35 miles south ofOrleans)* were attacked; 250 tons of bombs were released at each.(e) Batteries, coastal defences and Military Objectives. At night, strongattacks were carried out against targets at St. Valery-en-Caux (470 tons), Dieppe(338 tons), Berneval (381 tons), Morsalines (369 tons), Mardyck (306 tons), Calais(217 tons) and at Cap Gris Nez (534 tons). Day-bombers dropped 1,560 tons oninstallations along the Normandy coast and on cross-channel coastal defences.(f) Industrial targets-Attacks were carried out by night on a foundry andstamping plant at Gennevilliers, a suburb of Paris (313 tons), on a ball-bearingfactory at Annecy (110 tons) and at Le Mans, where 90 tons were dropped on an aircraft repair factory.*Italy.44. In all operational theatres covered by the M.A.A.F. up to the weekended the Qth May, Allied aircraft flew a total of 12,829 sorties for the loss of73 aircraft; 84 enemy aircraft were destroyed.The main weight of attack was directed against enemy communications.Widespread operations were carried out by bombers and fighters with a specialconcentration by fighter bombers in Central Italy; a total of 2,843 sorties was flown by fighter bombers. Road and railway bridges were systematically attacked and no less than 37 of these targets were hit, seven were probably hit and inseven instances the approaches were seriously damaged. Combined with these operations, repeated hits were made on railway tracks, which were cut with greatfrequency; roads were also hit and 19 M/T vehicles were destroyed and89 damaged. Other objectives to be effectively bombed were railway centres,enemy supply and ammunition dumps and gun positions.Enemy activity was on a relatively small scale; a force of about 26 enemy bombers, of which six were destroyed by ground defences, made a night attackon shipping and the beachhead at Anzio. A formation of 18 enemy fighters was intercepted by eight Spitfires over the battle area, and nine enemy aircraft were shot down.Rumania.45. Bucharest was heavily attacked by day and three times at night. Therailway centre was bombed by 424 U.S. heavy bombers which dropped 993 tons,obtaining a very good concentration; at least 150 railway cars were destroyed and 150 others rendered immobile. The industrial area and marshalling yardswere bombed on three nights by a total of over 150 Wellingtons, and numeroushits were reported on factories and other objectives.Ploesti was bombed by 486 heavy bombers, the main weight falling on theAstra group of refineries from which dense clouds of black smoke rose to greatheights. Serious damage was also caused to the marshalling yards, which were subsequently attacked by over 100 Liberators. A good night raid was carriedout by Wellingtons on the Steaua Romana Oil Refinery at Campina (nearPloesti) where the Dubbs Cracking Plant and oil storage were damaged; damage was also caused at the Aquila refinery.Nearly 300 tons of bombs were dropped by Fortresses on an aircraft factory at Brasov; considerable damage was caused to the machine and assembly shops,and 52 railway wagons were destroyed in the sidings.The marshalling yards at Campina, Ploesti, Brasov., Turnu- Sever-in andCraiova were bombed by a total of 545 heavy bombers which released nearly1,200 tons of bombs; the targets were well covered.Fighter cover was provided for these operations and some enemy opposition was encountered. Forty-three enemy aircraft were shot down, and 36 Alliedbombers and 5 fighters are missing.Twenty Wellingtons and 11 Liberators laid sea-mines in the River Danube.
-1*1Yugoslavia and Albania.46. An attack was made on troop concentrations at Podgorica by!116 Liberators; 238 tons of bombs were dropped with good effect.Tighter bombers flew a total of 180 sorties and carried out harassing attacks on enemy communications, coastal shipping, supply dumps, hutted camps and anenemy H.Q. Eight M/T vehicles, four locomotives, one Siebel ferry and twoschooners were destroyed, whereas damage was caused to 34 M/T vehicles,67 railway wagons and four coastal craft. 1The Belgrade-Pancevo bridge was bombed by Fortresses and several direct hits were reported. x      -Hungary.47. Budapest Rakos&apos; marshalling yards were bombed at night by 58Wellingtons and five Halifaxes; several fires and explosions were reported inthe yards.   One Wellington is missing.-flSgean.48. Beaufighters destroyed or seriously damaged one escort vessel and sixcaiques.   Maleme airfield (Crete) was twice bombed by Mitchells.Russia.49. A fair degree of Russian air activity occurred on the First UkrainianFront, directed to the support of ground attacks in the Kovel zone, and againstairfields supplying air support to the German counter-attacks south of Stanislavovand Tarnopol. There was, moreover, on the First Ukrainian Front, a number ofair attacks against German motor and rail transport and against forward dumps.On the Second Ukrainian front, heavy Russian air support was given to attackingground formations west of Jassy.Against Sebastopol there was daily large-scale activity, but details of objectives attacked are not known.Attacks on convoys in the Black Sea are reported, as a result of which theRussians claim to have sunk a number of German transports moving betweenSebastopol and the Rumanian coast.The Long-Range Bomber Force delivered three raids during the week, twoagainst Lvov and Sambor, and the third against Sebastopol.The distance of Sebastopol from the mainland was too great to permit any german support from the relatively strong close support forces now based inRumania and Bessarabia, and lack of adequate air cover undoubtedly contributedappreciably to the rapidity of the German defeat.Burma.50. Allied aircraft for the week ended the 9th May, flew a total of 2,732offensive sorties; 13 Allied aircraft are missing and 12 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Transport aircraft flew 1,580 sorties, carrying 2,711 tons, 10,279 men andevacuated 602 casualties.The main Allied effort was in the Chin Hills-Assam area, where over65 per cent, of the total bomber and fighter-bomber sorties were flown. Enemytargets were successfully attacked in the vicinity of Kohima, Palel, Bishenpur,and in the Manipur valley.Objectives were also attacked in the Arakan, Myitkyina and Katha areas.Attacks on enemy communication targets resulted in the destruction of 54river-craft, seven M/T vehicles and one bridge, and damage to 193 river-craft,30 M/T vehicles and five bridges.Pacific.New Guinea Zone.51. Naval Liberators, operating from Manus, attacked Mokmer airfield onBiak Island (Schouten Islands) each day from the 4th to the 8th. Over 110 tonsof bombs were dropped in one of these operations; large fires were started and11 Japanese fighters, attempting to intercept, were destroyed.
Coastal targets in the Wewak/Hansa Bay/Wakde Island area, supply dumpson Kairiru Island and the four airfields around Wewak were constantlyharassed. Between the 2nd and the 6th, nearly 400 sorties were flown on these operations.New Britain and New Ireland.52. During the week ended the 7th May, 700 sorties were flown against gun positions and airfields at Rabaul, stores near Kerawat airfield and supply centresat Talili Bay and Matupi Island. Coastal guns at Borpep and Namatanai(New Ireland) were subjected to sustained attacks. Considerable destruction was caused.Bougainville.53. On the 6th, very large fires were started by Allied aircraft which attacked the waterfront at Matchin Bay, south of Buka Passage.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.54.   There are no incidents of importance to record.
