Printed for the War Cabinet: June 1944.W.P. (44) 294.2nd June, 1944.SECRET.Copy No.o 00WAR CABINET.UNITED NATIONS WAR CRIMES COMMISSION.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.THE Attorney-General and I have been considering, in consultation with sir Cecil Hurst, the Chairman of the Commission, and Sir William Malkin,the situation in which the work of this Commission now finds itself, and we feelthat a situation has arisen which calls for the attention of the War Cabinet and,it may be, for some authoritative decisions. The main matters which give usconcern are stated in the following paragraphs.2. The Commission has now been at work for five months. It includesmembers drawn from or representing the Dominions and all the principal Allies,except Soviet Russia. The purpose of the Commission was to investigate allcases referred to it by any of the Allied Governments of atrocities committed by, or by order of, the nationals of any of the countries at war with any of theUnited Nations against nationals of the United Nations;, to collect, record andassess all available evidence upon such atrocities, and particularly on atrocitiesorganised and committed in accordance with deliberate policy; and to reportfrom time to time to the Governments of the United Nations cases in which theCommission - is satisfied that an atrocity has been committed, naming, where possible, the person or persons whom they consider responsible. This was thebasis upon which the President of the United States approved the appointmentof the Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes, and an announcement to this effect was made both here and in America on the 7th October, 1942.3. It is evident, therefore, thatvthe first and main task of the commission was to collect evidence of war crimes such as might be made the basis of trial and punishment by such methods as the Allies might adopt. I have, however,recently received a letter from the Chairman, Sir Cecil Hurst, which shows that very little progress has been made with this task. Up to the end of March only about seventy cases had been transmitted to the Commission by the NationalOffices of the different Allies. Of these, half are incomplete,- and a large numberof the cases-can only be described as trivial in character. Some of the Allies among them the United States, Greece and Yugoslavia, have, so far, not set up aNational Office for the transmission of evidence to the Commission, thoughevidence may have been collected by those Governments. If one contrasts this minute result with the pronouncements that have been made of the intentions ofthe Allies (some of which are set out in the Annexes 1 to 6 to this paper) oneappreciates the anxiety of the Chairman of the Commission as to the position.There is a widespread assumption (though the details of the Commission^ work are, of course, not publicly known) that at the end of the war the commission will have put the Allied Governments in the position to institute proceedings against war criminals for definite outrages which can be proved, and yet theprospect of any such actual result being secured by the present working of the. Commission is exceedingly meagre.4. I think the paucity of the result is in part due to an unduly narrowconstruction of their terms of reference which the Commission has adopted andhave transmitted to the Allies. They have discouraged the transmission ofevidence to them unless the evidence available actually points to some particular[27451]b
enemy individual being responsible so that he can be named as an accused. the attorney-General and i think that this is much too strict a limitation to put upon the work of the Commission and that it would be of the utmost value ifthe Commission were to endeavour to collect evidence available of war crimes(and expecially of organised atrocities) whether or not it is possible on present information to mention by name the individual primarily responsible. It may bethat if details are collected now with the.help of witnesses already available to prove the perpetration of an atrocity by the enemy, the identification of the personreally responsible for ordering it will come later owing to enemy surrenders, oreven at the time of the Armistice. At any rate, it seems to us that the commission should aim at reporting to the Allied Governments the most shocking occurrenceswith such details as they can obtain, and not feel debarred because up to thepresent they cannot get the name of the commander or other officer responsiblefor directing these atrocities to take place. / should be grateful for the authorityof the War Cabinet in pressing this broader view of the Commissions functions.I have explained this view to Sir Cecil Hurst, and he is personally in agreementwith it and is endeavouring to get the Commission to take action on these lines.5. The small number of cases Submitted to the Commission has led that body to concentrate on other matters and to suggest extensions of its terms of reference,some of which are referred to below. But it seemed to the Attorney-General and myself of great importance that the Commission should put first their primaryduty of collecting evidence of war crimes, and it would assist them if I was able toinform the Chairman that His Majesty&apos;s Government attach the greatest importance to the Commission not only collecting the details of cases againstindividuals but of collecting evidence of the commission of war crimes generallyby our enemies, and, so far as possible, of seeing that the various Allied nationsrepresented on the Commission co-operate in this task by submitting freely and fully the information which they may have.6. The suggestion has been put forward within the Commission that members of the Gestapo, and possibly other organisations doing the same sort ofwork, ought, when Germany is occupied, to be surrendered en bloc and kept in detention until it is seen whether there is evidence implicating them in the war crimes which have been committed. This suggestion arises from the small numberof individual names submitted. There are one or two members who go further and suggest that membership of the Gestapo should itself qualify for punishment.This would be contrary to our principles, but it may well be right to considerwhether members of the organisation that has been administering these variousoccupied territories in some cases, I think, the Gestapo, in some cases not should not properly be detained pending the further evidence that will be availableafter the countries are reoccupied. This is a political issue, and if it was decidedto be sound, this would not give this Commission any great increase of work,though I understand they might be able to get through underground sourcesfurther information as to the way in which the administration has been conducted in these occupied areas, and, therefore, of those who are primarily responsiblefor the atrocities. // the War Cabinet approved, I think it would be sufficient if at this stage I was authorised to tell Sir Cecil Hurst that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment thought this suggestion was well worth further consideration and would-be glad to receive and consider with the other Governments any report which theCommission issues on the suggestion.7. There are two special points which have been raised. At present theterms of reference on which the Commission are working do nbt include war crimes committed by Germans against Italians. I know that the United states forces in Italy have been investigating evidence with regard to a particular caseof this kind, and I would suggest that we should be ready to agree to an extensionof the Commissions terms of reference to include such cases, it being understoodthat this does not prejudge any decision as to how such cases should be ultimatelydealt with.8. War Crimes committed against Danes in Denmark have raised the same question as set out in the last paragraph with regard to Italians. I suggest thatwe should be ready to agree on the same lines to the Commission taking evidence as to these.9. There is a much larger and more difficult question which has been*brought before the Attorney-General and myself, and which I think requires special consideration from the War Cabinet. The question is whether the present Corn-mission can do anything to investigate the massacres or other horrible ill-treatment
of German Jews in Germany. It is, of course, perfectly clear that this does not come within the category of a war crime, for a war crime essentially involvesmaltreatment by the enemy of those who are not fellow-subjects of the enemy. Weasked the Chairman of the Commission what evidence the Commission hadcollected of the terrible massacres and atrocities in Poland perpetrated byGermans not only against Polish Jews but against Jews from other occupied countries who had been deported there to be massacred or starved (one of thequotations in the Appendix to this paper is an extract from the declaration madeby the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons on the 17th December, 1942,on this subject). Sir Cecil Hurst told us some weeks ago that none of the evidence which undoubtedly is in the possession of the Polish Government has beentransmitted to the Commission. It may be that this has been due to some misunderstanding. I am told that quite recently the Polish Government has beensubmitting some evidence on this matter to the Commission. The Attorney-General and I have no doubt that these massacres on Polish soil by and underthe authority of the German-occupying power are war crimes, and, that those responsible, if they were identified and brought before a suitable tribunal, mightbe tried and punished under recognised principles. On the other hand, to seek to try by any sort of Allied or Inter-Allied court German officials for acts donein Germany to German subjects (albeit Jews) or to persons ordinarily resident in Germany would raise great legal difficulties. One could not appeal to the laws and usages of &quot;war or international law. It would, be useless to appeal to german law, which is the law under which the officials were living and to whichthey were subject at the time. Hitler&apos;s treatment of the Jews both before and during the war undoubtedly will play a large part in the decision of the Alliesas to his own fate or the fate of any of his important colleagues who fall intoAllied hands.10. I would like the authority of the War Cabinet to stimulate theCommission, which seems to be somewhat unenterprising in this matter, to collect the evidence of atrocities perpetrated in occupied countries by Germans againstJews. It may be that certain Jewish organisations which have undergroundcommunication with Poland and the like could give valuable assistance. I wouldbe inclined to oppose any suggestions that the present Commission should collectevidence of maltreatment of Jews in Germany itself, i.e., in circumstances whichwould not constitute an offence against the laws and usages of war. We run therisk of getting into considerable confusion if the Commission is allowed to concern itself with incidents which are not war crimes at all. If it is felt desirable to collect evidence of what has been done in Germany, the arrangements for doing this would, I think, best be made otherwise than through the Commission.11. As the War Cabinets attention is now being again addressed to thesubject, I think it well to emphasise that none of the above paragraphs in anyway prejudge the extremely difficult question as to what is to be done with the\principal miscreants who have been responsible for the war and have acquiesced in its atrocities, should any of them fall into Allied hands at the end of thefighting. That question is by the Moscow Declaration largely relegated to theGovernments of the countries where specific war crimes have been perpetrated.The fate of Hitler and Co. is a political question and must be decided by theprincipal Governments themselves, and not by a court of judges, whether national or international.12. I was asked, in company with the Attorney-General and the Ministerof Aircraft Production (Conclusions of War Cabinet WM. (44) 34th Conclusionsof the 13th March) to prepare for the WTar Cabinefs consideraton a revised draftformula to express the proposal which His Majesty&apos;s Government would make to the United. States and Soviet Russia for defining the procedure to be adoptedin dealing with these prime criminals. The formula we now suggest, in thelight of the previous discussion, will be found in Annex 7.S.House of Lords,2nd June, 1944.[27451]
Statement by the Prime Minister, 25th October, 1941.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government associate themselves fully with the sentimentsof horror and condemnation expressed by the President of the United Statesupon the Nazi butcheries in France. These cold-blooded executions of innocentpeople will only recoil upon the savages who order and execute them.&quot; The butcheries in France are an example of what Hitler&apos;s Nazis are doingin many other countries under their yoke. The atrocities in Poland, in yugoslavia, in Norway, in Holland, in Belgium, and, above all, behind theGerman fronts in Russia, surpass anything that has been known since the darkestand most bestial ages of mankind. They are but a foretaste of what hitler would inflict upon the British and American peoples if only he could getthe power.&apos;&apos; Retribution for these crimes must henceforward take its place among the major purposes of the war.&apos;&apos;ANNEX No. 2.Statement by President Roosevelt, 7th October, 1942. ,&quot; On the 21st August I said that this Government was constantly receivinginformation concerning the barbaric crimes being committed by the enemyagainst civilian populations in occupied countries, particularly on the continent of Europe. I said it was the purpose of this Government, as I knew it to bethe purpose of the other United Nations, to see that when victory is won theperpetrators of these crimes shall answer for them before courts of law.&quot; The commission of these crimes continues.&quot; I now declare it to be the intention of this Government that the successfulclose of the war shall include provision for the surrender to the United nations of war criminals.&quot; With a view to establishing responsibility of the guilty individualsthrough the collection and assessment of all available evidence, this Governmentis prepared to co-operate with the British and other Governments in establishing a United Nations Commission for the investigation of war crimes.&quot; The number of persons eventually found guilty will undoubtedly be extremely small compared to the total enemy populations. It is not the intentionof this Government or of the Governments associated with us to resort to massreprisals. It is our intention that just and sure punishment shall be meted out to the ringleaders responsible for the organised murder of thousands of innocentpersons and atrocities which have violated every tenet of the Christian faith.&quot;ANNEX No. 3.Statement by the Lord Chancellor, 7th October, 1942.&quot; Firstly, then, as to the collection of the necessary evidence. The proposals is to set up with the least possible delay a United Nations Commission for the investigation of War Crimes. The Commission will be composed of nationals of the United Nations, selected by their Governments. The Commission willinvestigate war crimes committed against nationals of the United Nationsrecording the testimony available, and the Commission will report from time totime to the Governments of those nations oases in which such crimes appear tohave been committed, naming and identifying wherever possible the persons responsible. The Commission should direct its attention in particular toorganised atrocities. Atrocities perpetrated&apos;by or on the orders of Germany in occupied France should be included. The investigation should cover war crimesof offenders irrespective of rank, and the aim will be to collect material, supportedwherever possible by depositions or by other documents, to establish such crimes,especially where they are systematically perpetrated, and to name and identifythose responsible for, their perpetration.&quot; Now I have made a statement&apos;which I feel certainly greatly interests allyour Lordships, but I have to make a further statement which will emphasiseits importance.   A corresponding statement as to this proposed Commission for
the Investigation of War Crimes is being issued in Washington by the Presidentof the United States this afternoon. This proposal, therefore, has the jointsupport of the Government of the United States and of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and it has been communicated to the other United Nations directly concerned, including, of course, our Soviet and Chinese Allies, the Dominionsand India, and the Fighting French, with a view to obtaining their concurrenceand co-operation, and already we have received from the Allied Governmentsestablished in London and from the French National Committee replies warmlyapproving and adopting this proposal.&apos;&apos; The ambit and purpose of the United Nations Commission for the investigation of War.Crimes that is to be its title will be clear from what Ihave already said, but to avoid any misunderstanding and to take away any possible excuse for misrepresentation in enemy quarters, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment wish to add this and a statement to the same effect is, I understand, being issued at this moment in Washington by the United States Government. Inmaking this proposal for an investigating Commission the aim is not to promote the execution of enemy nationals wholesale; the aim is the punishment of individuals, obviously very few in number in relation to the total enemypopulation individuals who are proved to be themselves responsible, whether asringleaders or as actual perpetrators, for atrocities atrocities which violateevery tenet of humanity and have involved the murder of thousands, of tens of thousands, of innocent persons.&quot;ANNEX No. 4.Statement by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 17th December, 1942,in reply to a Parliamentary Question.&quot; Mr. Silverman (by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs whether he has any statement to make regarding the plan of the GermanGovernment to deport all Jews from the occupied countries to Eastern europe and there put them to death before the end of the year ?&apos;&apos; The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Eden) : Yes, Sir, I regretto have to inform the House that reliable&apos; reports have recently reached HisMajesty&apos;s Government regarding the barbarous and inhuman treatment to whichJews are being subjected in German-occupied Europe. They have, in particular,received a note from the Polish Government, which was also communicated toother United Nations and which has received wide publicity in the Press. HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have as a result been in consulta-tion with the United States and Soviet Governments and with the other AlliedGovernments directly concerned, and I should like to take this opportunity tocommunicate to the House the text of the following declaration which is beingmade public to-day at this hour in London, Moscow and Washington : &quot; The attention of the Governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece,Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the United States of America,the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Union of soviet Socialist Republics and Yugoslavia, and of the French national committee has been drawn, to numerous reports from Europe that theGerman authorities, not content with denying to persons of Jewish race inall the territories over which their barbarous rule has been extended the mostelementary human rights, are now carrying into effect Hitler&apos;s oft-repeatedintention to exterminate the Jewish people in Europe. From all the occupied countries Jews are being transported, in conditions of appalling horror andbrutality, to Eastern Europe. In Poland, which has been made the principalNazi slaughterhouse, the ghettoes established by the German invaders arebeing systematically emptied of all Jews except a few highly skilled workersrequired for war industries. None of these taken away are ever heard ofagain. The able-bodied are slowly worked to death in labour camps. Theinfirm are left to die of exposure and starvation or are deliberately massacredin mass executions. The number of victims of these bloody cruelties isreckoned in many hundreds of thousands of entirely innocent men, women and children. . ^&apos;&apos; The above-mentioned Governments and the Frefich national committee condemn in the strongest possible terms this bestial policy Ofcold-blooded  extermination.   They  declare  that  such   events  can  only
strengthen the resolve of all freedom-loving peoples to overthrow thebarbarous Hitlerite tj^ranny. They reaffirm their solemn resolution to ensurethat those responsible for these crimes shall not escape retribution, and topress on with the necessary practical measures to this end.&apos; &quot;ANNEX No. 5.The Moscow Declaration, 1st November, 1943.&quot; The United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union havereceived from many quarters evidence of atrocities, massacres and cold-bloodedmass executions, which are being perpetrated by the Hitlerite forces in the many countries they have overrun and from which they are now being steadily expelled.The brutalities of Hitlerite domination are no new thing, and all the peoples orterritories in their grip have suffered from the worst form of government by terror.What is new is that many of these territories are now being redeemed by theadvancing armies of the liberating Powers, and that, in their desperation, therecoiling Hitlerite Huns are redoubling their ruthless cruelties. This is nowevidenced with particular clearness by monstrous crimes of the Hitlerites on theterritory of the Soviet Union, which is being liberated from the Hitlerites, and on french and Italian territory.&quot;Accordingly, the aforesaid three Allied Powers, speaking in the interestsof the thirty-two United Nations, hereby solemnly declare and give full warning of their declaration as follows :  &quot; &apos; At the time of the granting of any armistice to any Governmentwhich may be set up in Germany, those German officers and men and membersof the Nazi party who have been responsible for, or have taken a consentingpart in, the above atrocities, massacres and executions, will be sent back to thecountries in which their abominable deeds were done, in order that they maybe judged and punished according to the laws of those liberated countries andof the free Governments which will be created therein. Lists will becompiled in all possible detail from all these countries, having regardespecially to the invaded parts of the Soviet Union, to Poland and Czecho-slovakia, to Yugoslavia and Greece, including Crete and other islands, to norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg, France and Italy.&quot; &apos; Thus, the Germans who take part in wholesale shootings of Italianofficers or in the execution of French, Dutch, Belgian, or Norwegian hostagesor of Cretan peasants, or who have shared in the slaughters inflicted on the. people of Poland or in territories of the Soviet Union which are now beingswept clear of the enemy, will know that they will be brought back to the scene of their crimes and judged on the spot by the peoples whom they haveoutraged. Let those who have hitherto not imbued their hands with innocentblood beware lest they join the ranks of the guilty, for most assuredly thethree Allied Powers will pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth andwill deliver them to their accusers in order that justice may be done.&apos; &quot;&quot;The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the majorcriminals, whose offences have no particular geographical localisation, and whowill be punished by the joint decision of the Governments of the Allies.&quot;ANNEX No. 6.Statement made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in reply to a parliamentary Question, 30th March, 1944.&apos;&apos; Mr. SUverman (by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs whether, in view of the recent enemy occupation of Hungary and the rapidmarch of events in the Balkans, he has any statement to make with reference to the urgent and immediate peril which now threatens Jews and other victims of Nazipersecution in those countries.&quot; Mr. Eden: Yes. Sir. My hon. friend will have taken note of the state-ment made on the 24th March by President Roosevelt on the subject of his question, and of the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government at once wholeheartedly
associated themselves with the United States Government in this matter. further action is now under discussion between the United States Government and HisMajesty&apos;s Government and I wish now to take this opportunity of making, onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the following declaration: Evidencecontinues to reach His Majesty&apos;s Government and Allied Governments, that the nazi policy of extermination has not been halted. The persecution of the Jewshas in particular been of unexampled horror and intensity. On this His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in common with their Allies, now that the hour of Germany&apos;s defeatgrows ever nearer and more certain, can only repeat their detestation of Germany&apos;scrimes and their determination that all those guilty of them shall be brought tojustice. But apart from direct guilt there is still indirect participation in crime.Satellite Governments who expel citizens to destinations named by Berlin mustknow that such actions are tantamount to assisting in inhuman persecution orslaughter. This will not be forgotten when the inevitable defeat of the arch-enemy of Europe comes about.&quot;Happily there are individuals and even official authorities among the satellites who have resisted the evil German example and have shown tolerationand mercy. These things are known to the Allies, and in the hope of encouragingsuch good deeds and increasing their number His Majesty&apos;s Government areconcerned to make it clear that those who have followed the right path will also not be forgotten in the day of final reckoning. The time of respite is short, butthere is still opportunity for the merciful to multiply their acts of humanity, for the guilty to - try to make amends for their deeds ofshame by releasing their victims and making, so far as is possible, restitution tothem. His Majesty&apos;s Government are confident that they are expressing thesentiments of all the Allied Governments in calling upon the countries allied with or subject to Germany to join in preventing further persecution and co-operate in protecting and saving the innocent. His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part,are firmly resolved to continue, in co-operation with all Governments and privateauthorities concerned, to rescue and maintain so far as lies in their power all thosemenaced by the Nazi terror.&quot;The Prime Minister, 24th May, 1944.&apos;   (Speech in the House of Commons.)&apos;&apos; Justice will have to be done and retribution will fall upon the wicked andthe cruel. The miscreants who set out to subjugate first Europe and then theworld must be punished, and so must their agents who, in so many countries, haveperpetrated horrible crimes and who must be brought back to face the judgment ofthe population, very likely in the very scenes of their atrocities.&quot;ANNEX No. 7.&quot; The Three-Power Declaration at Moscow included an announcement ofthe procedure to be adopted in dealing with war.crimes committed in occupied territory, and concluded with the statement that this Declaration was withoutprejudice to the case of enemy criminals whose offences have no geographicallocation and who would be dealt with by a joint decision of the Governments ofthe Allies.&quot; The members of this inner ring of enemy leaders who have been generallyresponsible for the systematic atrocities, massacres and executions referred toin the Moscow Declaration, if they fall into the hands of the Armed Forces ofthe United Nations, will be held pending a decision by the United Nations as totheir fate.&quot; Quislings will be left to be tried for treachery by their own State courts.&quot;
