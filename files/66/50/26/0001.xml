SECRET. j       Copy No,--- /W.P. (44) 276.27th May, 1944.,WAR CABINET.FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL AVIATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN his Paper W.P. (44) 264, the Lord Privy Seal asks the War Cabinet todecide that the Civil Aviation Department of the Air Ministry should betransferred to the Ministry of War Transport six months after the end of thewar with Germany.2. Last December, as the Lord Privy Seal says, the C.A.T. committee decided the Paymaster-General, the Under-Secretary of State for Air and myself dissenting that responsibility for civil aviation should be transferred tothe Ministry of War Transport.3. The question was then referred, in accordance with the directions of theWar Cabinet, to the Machinery of Government Committee, who recommended&apos; see the Report by the Chairman, WP. (44) 134- that responsibility for civilaviation should ultimately be transferred to the Ministry of War Transport, butthat (a) the current control of civil aviation should remain with the Air ministry for the duration of the war with Japan; and (b) that no public announcement should be made at the present time.4. At a meeting of the C.A.T. Committee in March, the Chairman referredto the Report of the Machinery of Government Committee, explained that the-conclusions were not, in his view, satisfactory, added that he had asked for it tobe held up until the matter had been reconsidered by the C.A.T. Committee, and said that he wished to raise the project of a separate Ministry of Civil Aviation.The Committee reached no firm decision on this issue.5. Three statements have been made in Parliament this year on behalf of theGovernment: (a) On the 19th January, the Lord Privy Seal said : &apos;&quot; I think the whole House has agreed that there should notbe any plan or proposal for removing civil aviation from the care of the Air Ministry during the war.  If that is so, it seems to me* quite foolish and futile to discuss the future of civil aviation inrelation to the Air Ministry at this time.&quot;(b) On the 19th March, I said that responsibility for civil air transport rests,and must rest, with the Secretary of State for Air for the duration of the war; and(cj on the 5th April, the Deputy Prime Minister said that &quot;there is noquestion of removing civil aviation from the care of the Air Ministryduring the war.&quot;The words &apos;&apos; during the war &quot; in these statements mean  and were generallyinterpreted as meaning for the duration of the war with Germany and Japan.Certainly, as the Machinery of Government Committee appreciated, the practicalcase for leaving the current control of civil aviation with the Air Ministry until after the war with Japan is overwhelming. The direction of current operations and the planning of long-term policy are closely related in fact, indivisible.Current administration demands an intimate knowledge of the work that is proceeding on future planning and vice versa.[27537]Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.
6. I am not clear why it is felt to be necessary to take a decision now onthe arrangements which should apply after the war with Japan and I agree withthe remarks made by the Lord Privy Seal on this subject on the 19th January :see paragraph 5 (a) above. I would, in particular, urge that no decision should betaken until : (a) the pattern of post-war world security has been settled; and(b) the Government has decided on the future of the British Overseas Air-ways Corporation.As for (a), the development of civil aviation is indissolubly linked whether we like it or not with future arrangements for world security. This was stressedat the Commonwealth meetings last October when it was decided that any international authority established for civil aviation should be subordinated toany international authority established for world security. The report of thePost-Hostilities Planning Sub-Committee of the Chiefs of Staff Committee(circulated as C.A.T. (44) 19) also sti^essed the vital bearing of defence considera-tions on civil air transport policy. I would quote in this connection the followingviews of the Chief of the Air Staff : &quot; What the world will, in fact be like in thefirst years after the war is, however, still obscure. We do not know whether it willbe a peaceful world in which differences will be settled amicably by suitableinternational machinery or a world of stresses and strains in which one or more of the great Powers will be pursuing a violently expansionist policy and in whichthe requirements of security will be paramount. We cannot tell, therefore, untilthe war is actually over whether the defence or the economic aspect of civilaviation policy will come first.&quot;As for (b), if we decide to maintain the Public Corporation principle for theoperation of our air services, leaving ships and railways to be run by private enter-prise, there are cogent reasons against entrusting to one Department theresponsibility for all these forms of transport. The relationship between aGovern-ment Department and a Public Corporation is totally different from that between a Government Department and private enterprise, it demands a technique of itsown. Moreover, a Minister responsible for all forms of transport would besubject to constant pressure from the surface transport interests to restrict air transport activities, particularly those of an air corporation which was the instrument of the State. The history of the co-ordination of road and rail traffic-between the two wars is not encouraging in this connection. An independentAir Minister would be in a much stronger position to resist this pressure.In any event the importance of the argument that co-ordination of air services with other forms of transport calls for the centralisation of responsibility in oneTransport Department can easily be exaggerated. It seems likely that, in thepost-war world, the scale and scope of operations on the main commercial air routes will be determined internationally as air transport problems. Even faresmay be fixed by international agreement. Thus, the effective co-ordination will beinternational, between air and air and not between air and sea, and the co-ordina-tion of the air and sea transport services of individual nations will be of secondaryimportance.7.   Accordingly, I recommend :  (a) That the present arrangements should continue at least until after thewar with Japan.(b) That no decision should be taken about the arrangements which will thenapply until : (i) we know more clearly what the post-war security arrangements are to be; and(ii) a decision has been taken about the future of arrangements for theoperation of our overseas air services.8. If, nevertheless, the Cabinet feel that a decision should be taken now, Iwould wish to circulate to my colleagues a detailed Paper setting out the various considerations which arise on this complicated and most important issue.Air Ministry, 27th May 1944.A.
