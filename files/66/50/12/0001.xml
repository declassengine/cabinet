SELECT   COMMITTEE  ON  NATIONAL  EXPENDITURE.Memorandum addressed to the Prime Minister for the consideration of theWar Cabinet.-TANK   PRODUCTION.Introductory.(1) General.1. In August 1942 the Committee of that Session completed an investigation of Tank Production and submitted a Secret Memorandum to the War Cabinet.The general conclusion was that there had been faults in organisation whichhad led to avoidable waste of time, money and material resources. certain recommendations were made, important points in which were-(i) That the responsibility of the War Office and the Ministry of supply should be more closely &quot; clamped together.&quot;(ii) That the executive responsibility in the Ministry of Supply should be clearly placed on the shoulders of one man who should in effect be a&quot; Managing Director for Tanks,&quot; responsible both for Productionand for Design and Development.(iii) That the parent firms of manufacturers&apos; groups should be brought moreintimately into the picture and be consulted from the earliest stages in the conception of a new requirement.2. After these investigations, changes were made in the organisation which appeared substantially to satisfy the Committee&apos;s recommendations, and, on the assurances received both from the War Office and the Ministry of Supply, aReport* was presented to the House of Commons in November 1942 which included a general account of what had taken place in regard to tanks and recommended in effect that the new men and the new organisation should begiven a chance to make good.(2) Considerations Affecting the Occasion and Method of Reporting.3. In September 1943 we decided that we ought to resume our investigationso as to ascertain how far the new men and the new organisation had in fact&quot; made good.&quot; We felt that such a step would, in view of the previous Report,be expected by the House of Commons, and beyond this we were influenced by theconsideration that unfavourable comment was prevalent about tank production.4. We have mentioned the latter consideration because it has a bearing on our choice of method for reporting. This indeed has presented us with atroublesome problem. On the one hand, as already noted, we feel that a report is due to the House of Commons. On the other hand, we cannot disregard thepossible repercussions of a published report, or the great difficulties of makingone which would convey a true picture without revealing matters which, for;security reasons, must be kept secret. There is, moreover, a special difficulty aboutgiving a fair appreciation at the present moment when the Cromwell tank has just reached the stage of being considered ready for the test of battle. If itproves to be reliable in battle and to have substantial tactical advantages overthe Sherman, then undoubtedly the general picture which can be presented willchange. But this, the only real test, still lies ahead, and until it is accomplishedwe have no solid ground on which to base a report except the actual anddisquieting record of the past.   Our difficulty is increased by the fact that weEighteenth Report, H.C. 122, 1941-42.
have not been given full information on the programme that lies ahead, so thatwe are without all the data for judging how the present organisation is working.5. In these circumstances we have decided that our right course is in thefirst place to submit a Secret Memorandum to the War Cabinet stating ourimpressions and recommendations. We had contemplated that we should then,in the light of the reply received, decide in what sense we should report to theHouse of Commons. In the course of the final completion of this Memorandum,however, there occurred the discussion of the 2nd March in the House leading tothe prospect of an early debate on tanks in secret session. In view of this, andof what has been stated in the 18th Report of 1941-42, we must take into accountour responsibilities in regard to reporting to the House at an early date.6. On the 28th September, 1943, we asked for certain factual information from the Ministry of Supply and later, in November, 1943, further inquiries were submitted to the War Office. In response to these approaches a memorandum prepared jointly by the War Office and the Ministry of Supply was given to uslate in December 1943. This document, to which we refer hereafter as the &quot; WarOffice Memorandum,&quot; has been supplemented at various times by furtherinformation prepared for the most part jointly by the two Departments.Apart from this body of written official evidence we have examined a numberof witnesses orally : on the Army side, representatives of the General Staff, theRoyal Armoured Corps and officers from the Gunnery and Experimental Wingsat Lulworth; and on the Ministry of Supply side, departmental representatives, onthe Tank Board, officers of the development section under D.T.D. at Lulworth,and the Director-General of Artillery. In addition, we have had a substantial body of evidence from manufacturers engaged in both assembly work and engine production.7. On our review of the position, it is impossible to avoid the general impression that, measured in terms of production of tanks fit for current battlerequirements, the British manufacturing effort of 1943 has fallen far short ofrealising expectations or being fully effective, and has involved what appears tobe a wasteful use of national resources. We cannot, from our evidence, &quot;state the exact significance of this in terms of cash expenditure; but that the amountsinvolved are very large is shown by a statement, furnished by the Ministry ofSupply for another inquiry, according to which expenditure on tanks represented18-79 per cent, of their total expenditure on War Stores for 1942-43.The picture, as it has impressed itself on us, is drawn broadly in two ways in the two succeeding paragraphs :  (a) &quot; Prospect,&apos;&quot;, as forecast in 1942, compared with &quot;Performance &quot; in 1943.8/ In the first place we have compared &quot; prospect &quot; with &quot; performance &quot;by setting the achievement up to the end of 1943 side by side with our impression of the prospect as it was presented to us in the autumn of 1942.(Note. In the comparisons set out below (a) We have, for the sake of simplification, left out any reference to theValentine production. Full credit should, of course, be given forthe continuity of this part of the programme.(b) We have, on the &apos;&apos; prospect &apos;&apos; side, set out the general impressionswhich we gained, directly and indirectly, from a wide body ofevidence.)(3) Evidence Taken.The Results Achieved in 1943.(1) The General Picture.
Main points in  the  &quot; Prospect &quot;  as presented in the autumn of 1942.(a) That the Crusader had provedunreliable and was to go out of pro-duction.(6) That the Infantry Mk. IV(Churchill), though justified for itsoriginal home defence purpose, didnot justify continuance for overseasfighting and was to go out of production at the end of the current contract (early summer, 1943) and that the wholeVauxhall Group should then go over tocruiser tanks.(c) That the Cromwell, with a Meteorengine and carrying a 6-pdr. gun, was going to be the best tank in the world,and an important factor already in1943 fighting.(d) That the Centaur, with Libertyengine, was going to be . a very closesecond-best to the Cromwell (in factidentical except at the highest speeds).(e) That the Centaur was to beadopted because, owing to the demandsof the M.A.P. Merlin engine pro-gramme, a sufficient production ofMeteor engines for the total cruiserprogramme could not be organised.(/) That the whole British effort would be concentrated on the Cromwelltype of cruiser tank, and that the pro-duction of an infantry tank would cease to be part of the British programme.Actual &quot; performance &quot; in 1943.(a) Crusaders still represented 26 percent, of the total tanks produced in1943.(b) The Churchill has, according tothe Memorandum submitted by the WarOffice, &apos;&apos; established itself as a reliableand efficient weapon, having stood the test of battle experience in Tunisia andwon the  confidence  of  the troops.&quot;(But N.B. It has been allowed to dropout of battle, since Tunisia, apparentlyowing to the armament being judgedinsufficient.)(c) The Cromwell had, up to the endof 1943, not proved in quality to be a vehicle of sufficiently reliable perform-ance to be used in battle. Its productionin quantity fell far short of the pro-gramme. As a result it was considered necessary to change the &apos;&apos; parentage &apos;&apos;for Cromwell production in May 1943.Even if as armoured vehicles Cromwellshad been adequately reliable, they wouldnot have been sent abroad because, bythe time they came into production, theGeneral Staff had come to regard a cruiser tank equipped with a 6-pdr. gunas inadequate.id) The Centaur, with its Libertyengine, proved so unreliable whenhandled by units at home that, as agun-tank, it has been condemned. the liberty engine is to go out of production-tion, but, in order not to break upmanufacturers&apos; organisations, produc-tion will have to continue long aftercondemnation as a gun-tank engine.(e) It has been found possible during1943 to organise the production ofMeteor engines on a scale which is claimed to be adequate for the Avholecruiser tank programme.(/) The General Staff have acceptedthe policy that an infantry tank of theChurchill type is an indispensable partof the British programme.(b) Resources invested and &quot;Operational Dividend&quot; in 1943.9.   An alternative method for getting a broad impression of the factualresults is to compare the resources invested with the &apos;&apos; operational dividendrealised.   We have accordingly enquired what proportion of the tanks producedduring 1943 proved to be of value for the purposes for which they were planned,viz., as gun-tanks to be used by armoured formations.   The results are indicated
have not been given full information on the programme that lies ahead, so thatwe are without all the data for judging how the present organisation is working.5. In these circumstances we have decided that our right course is in thefirst place to submit a Secret Memorandum to the War Cabinet stating ourimpressions and recommendations. We had contemplated that we should then,in the light of the reply received, decide in what sense we should report to theHouse of Commons.

In addition, we have had a substantial body of evidence from manufacturers engaged in both assembly work and engine production.The Results Achieved in 1943.(1) The General Picture.7. On our review of the position, it is impossible to avoid the general impression that, measured in terms of production of tanks fit for current battlerequirements, the British manufacturing effort of 1943 has fallen far short ofrealising expectations or being fully effective, and has involved what appears tobe a wasteful use of national resources. We cannot, from our evidence,&quot;state the exact significance of this in terms of cash expenditure; but that the amountsinvolved are very large is shown by a statement, furnished by the Ministry ofSupply for another inquiry, according to which expenditure on tanks represented18 - 79 per cent, of their total expenditure on War Stores for 1942-43.The picture, as it has impressed itself on us, is drawn broadly in two ways in the two succeeding paragraphs : (a) &quot; Prospect &quot;. as forecast in 1942, compared ivith &quot;Performance&quot; in 1943.8. In the first place we have compared &quot; prospect &quot; with &quot; performance &quot;by setting the achievement up to the end of 1943 side by side with our impression of the prospect as it was presented to us in the autumn of 1942.(Note.

An alternative method for getting a broad impression of the factualresults is to compare the resources invested with the &apos;&apos; operational dividendrealised.  We have accordingly enquired what proportion of the tanks producedduring 1943 proved to be of value for the purposes for which they were planned,viz., as gun-tanks to be used by armoured formations.   The results are indicated
in the following table compiled from information furnished by the Ministry ofSupply:-Type.	Percentage of Total Number of Tanks produced during 1943.	Operationally adequate as Gun-tanks.	Actual Utilisation.Covenanter   ... Crusader Cavalier Centaur Cromwell Matilda        ..: Valentine Churchill	0-5 26 5 17 7-5 2 24 18	Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil A   small   number  for Far East. All operational; mainly for Russia. All  operational;    but N.B.   They have not been   ued   in  battle since Tunisia.	Obsolete. Two-thirds being converted as   gun-towers, A.A. tanks, &amp;c.    One-third for training. Half stated by Ministry of Supply to be destined as CP. tanks. The War Office evidence throws doubt on their value for this purpose. Half for training. Two-thirds   for  training, one-twelfth operationally   with  95   mm.    One-quarter intended probably for train-ing. Ministry of Supply say for operational units or training.   But War Office evidence is that up to 1st January, 1944,  no   production   models   were accepted as adequate for battle over-seas. Mainly for mine-sweeping.(c) The Development of the Programme ahead.10. Paragraphs 8 and 9 have dealt with actual results. But the achieve-ment of 1943 cannot be fairly judged without taking into account how theprogramme which lies ahead has been settled and how it now stands. Here weare in an unavoidable difficulty, since we have been precluded from enquiring intodetails of projected developments. We have, however, in the War Office Memo-randum, been given a general indication of present policy, and this has beensupplemented in certain respects by oral evidence. In order, therefore, to make clear the understanding of the position on which our conclusions and recommenda-tions are based, we set out shortly below such impressions as we have been ableto form.(i) Armament.We understand that the 6-pr., owing to its ineffective H.E. shell, has, since december 1942, been considered inadequate as a general form of tank-gun, butthat a small proportion, to fire a special type of A.P. ammunition, may still berequired to supplement the 75-mm. gun-tanks; that the 75-mm. M.V. (MediumVelocity) gun is regarded as a reasonably adequate dual-purpose weapon with a fairly good H.E. shell and with an A.P. performance equal to the 6-pr. whenboth are firing normal A.P.C.B.C. shot; that the &quot; 77-mm.&quot; will be worth havingas giving a better A.P. performance than the 75-mm., though its exact A.P.muzzle velocity and the content of its H.E. shell are still matters of uncertainty;and, finally, that the 17-pr. is the only British gun about which we have been toldwhich, for tank v. tank purposes, can be regarded as being in the same class withthe German 75-mm. gun in the Panther (Pz Kw V) or the 88-mm. in the Tiger(Pz Kw VI). These impressions have a bearing on our judgment of the presentposition.
(ii) Cruiser tank programme.The Cromwell (as now coming off the product-ion line with the modificationsdecided upon after the recent driving test)* is considered for the first time tohave got through its teething troubles and to be mechanically reliable. But theCromwell, even if it has thus attained mechanical reliability, is apparently tohave a limited production life. As from the middle of 1944 it is to be tailed off and replaced by a larger tank (A. 34) of the Cromwell type, taking the 77-mm.gun. The A. 34 involves redesigning 60 per cent, of the Cromwell parts. Itmust, therefore, be regarded as more than a modification, and as involving a factor of uncertainty in that it is likely to have to go through&apos; its own teething troublesbefore it will be accepted as a vehicle reliable for battle. The position as regardsarmament is even more uncertain. The 77-mm. gun has not yet been producedand fired. The design for its H.E. ammunition is still under discussion. Evenif it proves to be a good weapon, it will remain for tank v. tank purposes definitelyless powerful than the best German tank armament.(iii) Infantry tank programme.The production of the Churchill with developments is to continue as animportant element in the British programme. As from March 1944, the heavierChurchill, Marks VII and VIII, will be in production equipped with the 75-mm.M.V. gun or the 95-mm. gun-howitzer. But,- since the standard Churchill hashitherto continued in production with the 6-pr., emergency retrospective modifica-tions will be necessarj&apos;- if those already produced, including those with the troopsoverseas are to have what the General Staff now consider adequate armament.(iv) Other projects, S.P. motmtings, &amp;c.We have not been permitted to inquire into the very varied range of projects in hand outside the main lines of cruiser and infantry tanks or into the long-rangeprogramme for these two types. We have been informed, however, that &quot; projects for the mounting of still larger guns in tanks both of the Cromwell and Churchillseries are in hand and have reached varying stages of development.&quot;(2) Special Illustrative Cases.11. Paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 give the broad picture as it has impressed us.In order to make a closer check of current achievement we have taken evidence from manufacturers, and also examined, in some detail, two recent experiences,viz., the results brought to light in the recent 3,000-miles driving trials, and the story of the 75-mm M.V. gun.   Both cases illustrate important points.(a) The recent 3,000-Mile Driving Trials.12. The points brought to light in the recent driving test indicate that,while the general design of the Cromwell is now considered likely to achievemechanical reliability, there is still a real risk nf failure owing to defects inmaterials and workmanship. The faults revealed in the test show the need for more rigid qualitative control of materials and for better systems of inspection and works administration, not only in the main assembly firms, but among sub-contractors and manufacturers of every kind of part or component. These matters,which indicate that there is still serious need for improvements in organisation,are more fully examined in a later passage.   (See below paragraphs 22 to 29.)(b) The Story of the 75-mm. Medium Velocity Gun.13. Our investigations of what has occurred in the case of the 75-mm. gunhas brought to light several points which are most disturbing. We have beenchiefly impressed by the following matters :- (a) The delay which has occurred in getting this gun with a serviceablemounting fitted into Cromwell and Churchill tanks;(6) The fact that a design for a mounting, which has since proveddangerously inadequate, was approved for production;(c) The fact that tanks were issued to field formations with these defectivegun-mountings, with the result that it has been necessary to issue* We understand that the experience in the 8,000-mile trial led to decisions to introduce a number of important modifications which meant holding up tanks coming off the line; butthat these modifications have, since the middle of February, been incorporated in production.
urgent warning notices to the formations concerned/ a most fortunate result in view of the lack of confidence already prevailing in regard to British tanks;id) The fact that officers going through the A.F.V. School have now forseveral months had to&apos; receive instruction on gearing which they knewto be defective, and which they knew would have to be replaced bybetter gearing in the tanks to be issued for operations.- ^ 14. The reasons for what has happened and the defects in organisation which they appear to indicate are more fully dealt with in later paragraphs(30-36). The outstanding point relevant to this part of our memorandum is thedelay. In the War Office Memorandum it is stated that the possibility!of intro-ducing the 75-mm. M.V. gun as a dual purpose weapon in place of the 6-pr. was&quot;continuously under review&quot; in 1942; that &quot; in December 1942, as a result of middle East experience, the General Staff asked that this gun should&apos;be adopted as soon as practicable as the main armament of the majority of British Tanks &quot; ;and that &quot; on the same date the General Staff were informed by the Ministry ofSupply that an outline design had been prepared of the 75-mm. gun to fit into the-pr. mounting in British Tanks.&apos;&apos;&quot; Yet this requirement, though shown byfighting experience to be urgent, though involving none of the complications of producing a new type of ammunition, and though formulate,d;jand accepted inDecember 1942, had, up till February 1944, remained unsatisfied in terms ofserviceable production. Whether reliable mountings will, even now, be produced on a large scale still remains to be proved in practice, but the extremelyunfortunate results of the 14 months&apos; delay which has already occurred cannot beescaped. That this delay has not had more operational significance is because no british cruiser tanks, accepted as vehicles fit for battle, were produced during1943 itself a most unfortunate result. But the Churchill tanks have, all this time, been available as battle-worthy vehicles, and it appears to us both inexplic-able and regrettable that these should have been continued in productionthroughout 1943 with no better armament than the 6-pr.The Significant Points in the Results of 1943.(a) Mitigating Considerations.15. It is from the broad picture as given in paragraphs 8 to 10, supple-mented by our detailed examination of the matters covered by paragraphs 12 to 14,that we have formed our views on the situation. In judging the present organisa-tion we wish to give full weight to all the mitigating considerations that havebeen put before us.   Of these the following seem the most important :-(a) Owing to the lag in converting plans into production, the results of 1943do not necessarily afford a basis for criticising the organisation as ithas existed since we last reported, i.e., since the changes made in theautumn of 1942.(b) Account must be taken of the handicap under which the British tank production has struggled from the beginning of the war, resultingfrom the failure to continue on an adequate scale the organisation fortank design which had been built up in the last war.(c) British designers have had to cope with special problems such as the limitations imposed by railway transport requirements and the low: silhouette demanded by the General Staff.(df Difficulties have been caused by the dispersal of British manufacturingunits. (This point is relevant when comparisons are made with theAmerican organisation, which has been able to take advantage ofthe immense scale and concentration in one convenient centre of theAmerican motor industry.)(b) The Inescapable Facts,16. These considerations cannot all be accepted, without qualification, andthey provide in the main explanations of, rather than justifications for, pastshortcomings. (For example, it appears to us that if there had been a more clear and determined purpose, the restrictions referred to under (c) would not havebeen acquiesced in for so long.) But, whatever their significance, the main facts.remain that, apart from the Valentine in Russia and the limited use of the
Churchill in Tunisia, no British^ tanks during 1943 have been considered worthy of a place in the main battles; that British tanks issued to British troops have gained a bad reputation both for mechanical reliability and fighting arrange-ments; that British factory workers have seen very large quantities of completedtanks broken up, or parts &quot;(finished and half-finished) piling up to be taken awayas scrap; and that these things have combined to create a psychological atmosphere-phere about British tanks among all concerned with handling them which musthave unfortunate effects and which in our view deserves the urgent attentionof the War Cabinet. The past record in fact puts the onus of proof very heavily on those who claim that all is now well with the organisation for tank production.(1) Outstanding Points in the General Picture.17. From the broad survey (paragraphs 8 to 10) certain points seem to usto stand out for special comment.18. The contrast between &quot; Prospect &quot; and &quot; Performance &quot; (paragraph 8)seems to indicate that wrong appreciations were made at the end of 1942, andthis inevitably affects our judgment of the expectations that are now put forward for 1944 and onwards. The point which we find most disquieting is that itshould have been seriously contemplated at the end of 1942 that practically all&quot;the eggs&quot; as regards future tank production should be put into the &quot;onebasket &quot; of a type of cruiser tank which was still unproved as a mechanicalconstruction, and which was to rely for the major part of the programme on anengine which, on past performance, could only be regarded as inadequate andwhich has since proved to be so.19. The disappointing nature of the &quot; dividend &quot; for 1943 (paragraph 9)tells its own story. The alternative purposes recorded in column 4 of the table in that paragraph are doubtless of value, and other uses may be found of whichwe have not been informed ; but it was not for these purposes that the programme was originally planned, and we cannot believe that these could not have been attained far more economically if they had been the original objective. we recognise, of course, that several of the unsatisfactory features in the &quot; divi-dend&apos;&apos; resulted from decisions which were taken before the changes in organisation, and which have since been reversed. Judging by these reversals,we conclude that the main causes of trouble were, first, the reliance on the liberty engine, and, secondly, the original selection of the &quot; parent &quot; firm forthe Cromwell group. Due credit should be given to those filling the new appoint-ments for facing up to these matters, but there still remain important questions,some of which we set out below : (a) Could not the decisions reversing earlier policy (e.g., as regards theMeteor engine programme) have been taken earlier ?(&amp;) Has it really been necessary, for the sake of avoiding dislocation inemployment, to continue the production of obsolete or condemned types,of vehicle and engine so long as has been done ?(c) When it was decided that certain tanks (Crusader, Cavalier, Centaur)must continue in production even though they would not be accepted as gun-tanks, was the task of preparing all the modifications and appliances which would be necessary for their alternative uses under-taken with sufficient vigour and foresight ? We understand, forexample, that the production of Centaurs as gun-tanks has been continued much longer than was intended because the fittings and modifications required for using them as A.A. tanks were not ready.Our evidence also suggests some confusion as regards the equipment and uses of O.P. tanks.id) Lastly, and most important, the question already referred to : why hasthere been so long a delay in replacing the 6-pr. with the 75-mm. gun ?20. When we turn to our impressions on the present programme (para-graph. 10), our comments, owing to our lack of full information, can, of course, be* We fully appreciate that the supply of American tanks may be sufficient to meet the.requirements of British troops. But we cannot regard this as affording ground for not consideringthe British production programme on its merits, and on the assumption that these tanks areurgently required. Otherwise a substantial portion of British resources must be regarded as havingbeen employed without justification.
no more than tentative. We confine ourselves, therefore, to saying that we find it disquieting (a) that the Cromwell, even if it proves now to have attainedmechanical reliability, is apparently under sentence of supersession after a few-months of production life, (&amp;) that the position as regards the A. 34 should beaffected by so many uncertainties, and (c) that there should be no evidence ofproduction from projects on which we had evidence in our visits to factories inthe summer of 1942.21. It has seemed to us important to examine in some detail the special cases referred to in paragraphs 12 to 14 since these not only illustrate the workingof the organisation, but also throw light on what is involved in the charge offaulty workmanship which has figured somewhat prominently in our evidence from the General Staff.22. We have seen only a short preliminary report from the Fighting VehicleProving Establishment on this trial. From this it appears that the resultsbrought out the following main points in the comparison between the Cromwelland the Sherman. The Cromwell has a substantially better driving performancethan the Sherman (20 per cent, faster across country, 60 per cent, faster on theroad). The Sherman up to 2,000 miles is more reliable (though this result mayhave been affected by the Sherman being driven at a lower speed). The Cromwellhas a longer life (both engine and suspension).(i) The significance of &quot; faulty workmanship.&quot;23. The report also states that the trials brought to light comparatively fewserious design defects but &quot; a lot of very serious manufacturing faults in Englishtanks.&quot; Further investigation seems to show that the expression &quot; seriousmanufacturing faults&quot; is somewhat loosely used. Illustrations given of thesefaults were (a) faulty radiators1; (b) wrong fluid in the Lockheed system;(c) badly assembled gear boxes; (d) modifications not fitted (e.g., final drive bolts);(e) fan belts. Of this list it is worth noting that, according to our evidence, only(d) the failure to introduce the modifications of strengthened final drive bolts1 represented a straight fault in manufacture by the main assembly firms. Theradiators, the Lockheed units, gear boxes and fan belts, all represented bought-outparts. Further, in these cases, &quot; faulty manufacture &quot; was only partially thecause of trouble. The radiators, for example, we understand were made by sub--contractors to a design settled at the Belper establishment of the Ministryof Supply, and the assembly firm claims that it was a bad design and that theirown radiator as made for the&apos;&quot; Centaur &quot; proved adequate. The failure in thefan belts was essentially due to faulty material (bad rubber and canvas). Faultymaterial (faulty synthetic rubber pistons) is alleged also as one of the causes ofthe Lockheed system failures. In other cases faulty material and workmanshipboth played a part (e.g., tab-washers to lock the lock-nut in the gear-box madeof faulty material and knocked on by a fitter in such a way as to damage thewasher).   This analysis brings to light a number of points.(ii) The authority of parent, firms.24. The case of the final drive bolts illustrates a matter of considerable importance. The introduction of modifications in the assembly line at the righttime depends on having an efficient works system. Even if a parent firm itselfhas a first-class system of administration and inspection, faults may occur inmember firms of a group, and apparently the parent firm, although held responsibleby the Ministry of Supply for the products of the whole group, has no establishedauthority to control the working methods of its members. It appears to us that only a firm of proved first-class qualifications should be selected as a parent firm,and that such a firm when selected should be strengthened by official backing. Itis, in fact, an essential part of our recommendations that the two or three firms which after four and a half years of war have emerged as worthy for selectionas parent firms, should be treated as an integral part of the official organisation with a real share in the responsibility.(2) Lessons from the Special Cases Examined.(a) The 3,000-mile Reliability Trial.
(iii) The importance of careful selection of subsidiary manufacturers.25. Another point which emerges is the importance of great care in the selection of firms as sub-contractors or makers of any parts or components requiredfor tanks. The reliability of a tank depends on far more than the work done bythe main assembly firms. Apparent carelessness in this matter is brought out ina later paragraph.(iv) Faulty material.26. Since faulty material has been an appreciable factor, we must emphasise the urgency of ensuring that nothing but the best quality of material is issued for vital parts in tanks or their armament. Fan belts have apparently been acommon source of trouble. In the case of such vital accessories as these (or these -automatic cam referred to in a later paragraph) the quantity of materialsrequired in relation to total war production is negligible. Selected qualities of rubber, canvas or other materials should be made available for such vital parts.(v) The importance of inspection.27. Lastly, this case and many others which have come before us illustrate the vital importance of working up standards1 of inspection. This has to beconsidered under the two heads of Government inspection by the I.F.V. and inspection by manufacturers.(vi) Inspection by the I.F.V.28. We understand that the great difficulty has been to get rightly qualifiedpersonnel, and that, in default of this, it has been necessary to rely on employinggreater numbers and on the rule-of-thumb method of inspecting according to alist. We are informed that there has been a considerable improvement in theI.F.V. work over the last 12 months, and that the need for further improvement is fully recognised.It seems obvious that every possible opportunity should be taken for bringing in highly qualified experts, and for training those that are not. We suggest thatit might be valuable to transfer selected R.E.M.E personnel to* I.F.V.(vii) Inspection by manufacturers.29.   There are three main heads for consideration : (a) The system of inspection by manufacturers within their own works (either by the main assembly firms or by manufacturers of components).(b) Inspection by the parent firm of the work done by other members of theirgroup.(c) Inspection by the main assembly firms of parts or sub-assemblies madeby other firms.Here again the essential difficulty in all three cases is shortage of highlyqualified personnel resulting from the great expansion of work for most of theprincipal manufacturers. It seems clear that, if manufacturers&apos; inspection couldbe made more effective by taking a certain number of men off production, it wouldbe worth while to face some loss in quantity for the sake of securing a betterguarantee as to quality.(b) The Case of the 75-mm. Gun.30. We have already mentioned (paragraph 13) the main disturbing pointsbrought to light in this case, of which the most important from a practical pointof view has been the delay in getting British tanks equipped with armamentwhich, in the view of the General Staff, was essential. Various factors appearto have contributed to this delay.(i) Delay in settling design of mounting.31. We have been astonished to learn in evidence that although the require-ment was formulated as urgent and accepted as practicable in December 1942,it was not until the 3rd July, 1943, that the responsible officer under C.A.F.Vagreed with D.T.D. that the standard 6-pr. mounting would take the 75-mm.subject to defined modifications (a special S.A. cam, and a specially strengtheneddeflector bracket);  and, further, that it was not until the 10th July that the
///requirements for the elevating gear were categorically stipulated to the Ministryof Supply by the General Staff (i.e., the requirement for a geared elevation witha definite ratio and for equipment to enable indirect firing to be carried out). we find it difficult to understand why so many months were allowed to elapse without such points being settled, or why the General Staff did not press the matter moreurgently.   It appears to us that several months were wasted.32. After this initial delay, matters seem to have been handled expedi-tiously, since we have been told that tanks equipped with 75-mm. guns began tobe issued to formations in this country in October.* Unfortunately, however, this did not mean getting serviceable weapons into the hands of the troops, since themountings as produced proved to be seriously fautly when fired. There has there fore been substantial further delay in overcoming these faults. On theevidence that we have obtained hitherto, the position is somewhat confusing, andit is difficult to unravel the precise course of events or to understand how it cameabout that those responsible for designing the mounting did not anticipate thestrains to which it would be put when firing American ammunition in serviceconditions.(ii) Evidence on tests and trials.33.   We may record the following statements from our evidence : (a) That the trials on which reliance seems chiefly to have been placed were (i) A &quot; user&apos;s &quot; trial at Lulworth in March 1943 by the ExperimentalOfficer to D.E.A.C. working with the Officer in Charge of theD.T.D.&apos;s Development Wing. (This was a trial with 100rounds. The ammunition in this case was hand-picked and about 30 per cent, of the rounds were rejected. It was carriedout with a 75-mm. gun in a Valentine tank, on a mild steelfabricated mounting. The results were entirely satisfactory.)(ii) A technical trial by C.I.A. with 200 rounds American ammuni-tion. As in the case of (i), the ammunition was hand-picked,60 rounds out of the 200 being rejectedi and the results were satisfactory.(b) That is was on the results of the C.I.A.&apos;s trial that the mounting went into production.(c) That the tests referred to under (a) did not show up the weakness in themounting because the ammunition was hand-picked, whereas theordinary run of American ammunition may put a much greater strain on the mounting, since it includes rounds which, while not soinaccurate as to fail to go into the breech, are very hard to extract.(This explanation, however, was not accepted as proved by otherwitnesses -who alleged that it is impossible to create conditions bywhich it can be conclusively proved.)(d) That signs of widespread trouble began to come in during October frompractice firing by units; but that prior to this there had been trouble in various tests at Lulworth.(e) That the trouble was initially the breaking of the S.A. cam, but that whenthe cams were strengthened (by redesigning the shape and ensuringbetter heat treatment) so that they did not break, the strain was shiftedon to the bracket and caused distortion in this. This involvedredesigning and strengthening the bracket.(/) That distortion of the bracket occurred in firing trials (on the28th December, 1943) at Lulworth and went so far as to bring thefiring gear into operation, thus causing a serious accident, which involved the permanent disablement of the officer in charge of theDevelopment Wing.(g) That the bracket in the trial referred to in (/) was made of fabricatedmild steel, thus apparently representing an attempt at strengthening the originally approved design, but an attempt which did not go far enough.(h) That, apart from faults in design, there have been faults in manufacture and material.  Thus it has been stated (i) That a large number of broken cams showed clearly that the heattreatment had been faulty.* According to the War Office Memorandum, the first tank mounting this gun was delivered to the Service on 11th October, 1943.
(ii) That a contributory cause of trouble has been the difficulty of getting sufficient supplies of 3^ per cent, nickel steel, which&apos; isrequired for these cams. ,i(iii) That some of the brackets which showed deflection on firing weremade of faulty material-in fact, of what has been describedto us as &apos;&apos; bedstead brass &apos;&apos; instead of manganese bronze asspecified.(iii) Practical conclusions from the failure.34. To arrive at a sure and precise judgment on all the issues involved wouldrequire an elaborate enquiry with expert assistance. This we have not attempted,since, whatever the exact technical explanation of what has happened, it seemsto us that certain practical points emerge which admit of no reasonable doubt.The following are the main points relevant to the present enquiry : First.-It was sought to accomplish the task of carrying the 75-mm. gunin British tanks with a mounting which was less robust than that used forthe equivalent gun in the Sherman. If, as is now alleged, inaccuracies of american ammunition have been the main cause of the failure, that factorought to have been provided against from the outset, since this inaccuracyis well known to every soldier who has used any kind of American ammuni-tion in operations or training. To choose a less robust mounting was, in anycase, to take a risk which could only be guarded against by special care inthe design and materials used. This care does not seem to have been taken.&apos;If a combination of fighting experience and technical knowledge had beenbrought to bear on the original design, such a mistake ought to have been avoided.Second. The tests and trials, on the strength of which the originaldesign was passed for production, seem to have been confused and have proved by results to have been inadequate. It appears that trials were takeninto account which were carried out in artificial conditions and withmountings of a design different from that first selected for production. there seems to have been no decisive occasion when an attempt was made to reproduce service conditions and deliberately to reveal weaknesses and breakbreak down the mounting. That such a final test, under the combined super-vision of technical experts and officers with practical knowledge of battleconditions, should be carried out before production contracts are placed seemsto us to be essential.Third. The arrangements for manufacture seem to have been such that parts of the mountings were, in a number of cases, made of faultymaterial, improperly treated and finished. It is extremely disturbing, first,that manufacturers capable of such work should have been selected for making vitally important parts of war weapons, and secondly, that suchfaults should not have been detected on inspection.35. These conclusions seem to us to show that there has been somethingseriously wrong either with the organisation itself or with the discharge of the responsibilities which exist under it. Our impression is that there has beena combination of both. So far as concerns organisation, this is one of the cases which appears to illustrate the dangers of the splitting of responsibilities. Inregard to guns, we understand that the responsibility of the D.G. of A. for development (research, design and experimentation) and inspection is limitedto the gun itself (the tube and breech mechanism) and its ammunition. His&apos;&apos; frontier &apos;&apos; of responsibility now stops there, though formerly it went furtherso as to include the recoil system and the cradle. We have been informed thatthis division has led to difficulties in the past, but that in recent monthscollaboration between the parties on both sides of the &quot;frontier&quot; has been considerably better. We hesitate to express views on these extremely technical matters, but we find it difficult to avoid the impression that this splitting ofresponsibility has contributed to results such as those now under consideration.36. The conclusions in paragraph 34 also reinforce what has already been said as to the need for careful selection of contractors and for improvingstandards of workmanship, materials and inspection. We may add that wehave had other evidence of faulty workmanship in the manufacture of tankarmament.   The experience of the Gunnery Wing at Lulworth is that the finish
of guns generally is poor, and that no less than one in three of the firingmechanisms of the 75-mm. M.V. gun received at the Gunnery School has hadto be stripped and fitted by hand to make them interchangeable.Main Conclusions.(1) Defects in Organisation.37. Our conclusions from the foregoing review are that the new organisa-tion has not fully &quot;made good,&quot; and that the expectations recorded in theearlier Report (Eighteenth of 1941/42) have not been fulfilled. We do not wish tOi belittle the improvement which has taken place in the clarification ofresponsibility, in co-operation between the various branches, and in the leadingpersonalities; but, in our view, there is still urgent need for further improve-ment. It appears to us that since the appointment of Major-General Briggs,with his recent fighting experience, at the War Office,- and of Mr. Gibb at theMinister of Supply, there have been definite signs of better working. We believe,indeed, that the course of events might, iu several respects, have been differentif these appointments have been made earlier; but we cannot, a second time, be content to recommend waiting to see what the &apos;&apos; new men &apos;&apos; can do, since, in ourview, it is now demonstrated beyond question that the organisation itself is seriously defective.(2) The Dispersal of Responsibility.38.   The chief cause of trouble remains the familiar one of the division ofresponsibility which exists between The War Office (representing the users who want instruments of war for certain purposes);The Ministry of Supply which has to interpret the wants of the usersin terms of instruments capable of manufacture and to place the orders for&apos;their manufacture; andThe Manufacturers who have to carry out the orders.The essential needs are (A) A clear conception by the General Staff of their requirements, i.e., ofwhat type of tank they will require at the time when that tank tvillbe available in production (which means, if it is a new type, about two years ahead).(B) A linking up of the responsibilities for achieving results approachingas nearly as is practicable to the requirements as defined under (A).This means responsibilities for (i) The assessment of what is practicable, in design and production;(ii) The formulation of programmes of design, development and production, on the basis of (i);(iii) The execution of such programmes (including inspection andtesting of what is produced).39. As is shown by our recommendation in paragraph 53 we consider thatthe right arrangement in principle is that there should be a single overridingresponsibility, and that this should rest with the War Office as the authoritythai, has to stand or fall by the result.40. So long, however, as the responsibilities and functions are keptseparated, then at least everything should be done to reduce the effects of thisseparation to a minimum and to ensure that the three main agents work together in the closest partnership in such a way that each feels responsible for the wholecombined operation of the partnership. The three partners should, in fact, bejointly and severally responsible for the results.We cannot believe that many of the things which have happened in thepast could have happened if this joint and several responsibility for results hadbeen a reality.
41. In spite of all that has been done to improve the position in the last twelvemonths, our evidence shows only too clearly the dangers of divided responsibility between three agents with each of the three able to shift on to one of the others theresponsibility for any failure in the joint result. Moreover, this dispersal or con-fusion of responsibility seems to exist, not only as between the three main agencies,but also within the organisations in the War Office and the Ministry of Supply.Our impression of the present set-up is indeed that &quot;alibis&quot; for failures inresults can far too easily be produced by everyone concerned. We have tried toform a fair judgment on the past record, and our conclusion is that a certain measure of blame attaches to each of the three main agencies.(a) The War Office and the General Staff as Representing the Users.42. One great danger arising from division between the &apos;&apos; user &apos;&apos; and&quot; producer&quot; responsibilities, is that the &quot; user &quot; may not take full account of how long it takes to introduce new types or modifications or of the dirsuptiveeffect which these have on production in the case of a complicated constructionsuch as a tank. He tends, therefore, not to make up his mind early enough andto be too ready to change his requirements according to changing experience onthe fighting fronts. This tendency has certainly revealed itself in the actualcourse of events, and there is a substantial element of truth in the criticism madeby one industrial witness that &quot; development has proceeded in a series of shortnervous little steps, each of which has been sufficient to disrupt production; but no one so far has had sufficient courage, or been able, to assess the battle require-ments sufficiently far ahead to make a technical jump that is going to put usahead of the Germans.&quot;43. It seems, further, that the General Staff have not been sufficientlydecisive in stating their requirements or in choosing between the variouspracticable alternatives,^ and facing the consequences. They also appear to havebeen too ready to take the attitude vis-a-vis the Ministry of Supply, &quot; We say what we want and they say what they can do and then they get on with it, andafter that our responsibility ends.&quot; In dealing with new ideas for tanks this implies a dangerous over-simplification both of the problem and of the soldiers&apos;responsibility. Past records show that in converting tank requirements into production there is never a clear run. All sorts of unexpected difficulties cropup and fresh decisions have continuously to be taken. The Army side mustconstantly watch how things are going during the course of converting ideasinto production,, and it is for them, above all, to impart a sense of urgency tothe whole process.In recording the above remarks we have had in mind the general course ofaffairs over the past two years. .One point in particular appears to be illustrated by what happened in connection with the A. 34. On this matter there has been some conflict of evidence, but what chiefly impressed us was a statement fromthe General Staff side that it came as a shock to them when, some months afterthe idea had been mooted, they were informed that the improvement on the75-mm. M.V. gun which they required (for which the &quot; 77-mm.&quot; was eventuallyadopted) would involve enlarging the Cromwell turret and, consequently, changing the hull to such an extent as to mean putting a new tank into production.44. In stressing (paragraph 42) the importance of making plans far ahead and then adhering to them, we do not imply that short-range modifications andimprovisations should not be made, since it is vitally important that the organisa-tion should be tuned up to respond quickly, within the limits of what is possible,without disrupting the main flow of production. The need for replacing the-pr. with a better gun is a clear example of a short-range alteration which,as we have already strongly emphasised, ought to have been made much more quickly, t The need for knowing what is practicable in the way of improvisation,and imparting a sense of urgency to its accomplishment, is one of the strong-grounds for establishing direct contact between the War Office and manufacturers and for giving the War Office the leading responsibility.45. Finally, no arrangement for unifying responsibility, especially if thattakes the form of placing the single responsibility on the War Office, can work* In the perennial dispute between armament, armour, power-weight ratio, suspension,electrical fittings, and simplicity for production, the responsibility for settling the final balance of choice must rest with the General Staff.t Incidentally, this case also illustrates the lack of forward planning, since the 6-pr. was practically obsolete as a tank gun by the time it reached the fighting formations in substantial numbers.
properly if the responsibility on the War Office side is itself confused or divided.Our impression is that at present there is a need for a closer linking-up betweenplanning, training and operational responsibilities in connection with A.F.V.Sand S.P. mountings.(b) The Ministry of Supply.46. In the case of the Ministry of Supply, one danger of the existingdivision of responsibility, involving their interposition as an intermediary between the user and producer, is that they may interpret the General Staffdemands in a way which does not really meet the fighting soldiers&apos; requirements.We have, however, in this inquiry been chiefly concerned with the results of the division of responsibility between the Ministry and the manufacturers. Thepoint made by the latter is that a tank cannot be designed in a detached drawingoffice, but that at every step the designers must be in close touch with those whowill have to execute the production. In the earlier Memorandum the Committeecommented on the months which had been wasted in certain cases because modifi-cations for meeting army requirements had been designed by the staff of theD.T.D., and then, when submitted to manufacturers, had proved to be quite impracticable as production jobs. They strongly recommended thatmanufacturers should be consulted from the outset and continuously. We havebeen glad to note that recently there appears to have been a marked improvementin this matter. In the case of the A. 34, for example, from the moment when the project was finally decided upon, the work of design was entrusted to the LeylandCompany, and the D.T.D.&apos;s branch, which has undoubtedly accumulated valuableknowledge, gave assistance by lending staff to work with Leyland&apos;s designers.This seems to us to be the right method, but even in this case our impression isthat it would have been better from every point of view if the Leyland repre-sentatives had been brought into the discussions when the idea was first mootedin January 1943. We have, further, received evidence which indicates thatcases still occur when time is wasted by design work being undertaken by D.T.D.without consulting manufacturers. We have been told, for example, that therehas been a recent urgent demand for an all-round-vision cupola to be fitted on toall tanks; that D.T.D. prepared a design; and that the manufacturers found ithad been done in such a way as to involve processes of production which, even if practicable, would have involved immense delay and unnecessary expenditure.^As indicated in our recommendations, we adhere to the view expressed in theCommittee&apos;s former Report that the leading manufacturers should be broughtinto still closer partnership in the responsibility not merely for- design, but also for suggesting new ideas.(c) The Manufacturers.47. In the case of the manufacturers, the danger of division ofresponsibility is that they may not feel responsible for results. The presentposition is in effect that they are told to do a job according to a certain design and that it is not their business to express their ideas as to whether it is likelyto be suitable for the task required. If it fails in this, they can wash their handsof responsibility. We cannot help comparing this position with that of theaircraft industry. When a Lancaster bomber goes into the air, the reputation of A. V. Roe and Company and, indeed, of the whole Hawker-Siddeley Groupgoes with it. There is no full parallel in the case of tanks. Possibly the VauxhallCompany and Vickers have had something of this feeling in the case of theChurGhill and the Valentine respectively, and it is significant that these havebeen the most successful British tanks. But in the case of cruiser tanks therehas never been a clear identification of a particular type with a particular firm,proud of its reputation, and it would be extremely difficult, to make an affiliationorder for the Cromwell or any of its relatives.We believe that this consideration is of real importance and that it hassomething to do with the share in the blame for bad results which is attributed to faulty workmanship by manufacturers.* Evidence from manufacturers indicates that the complaints about ideas being developed indetachment from the practical experience of the main tank producers apply not only to the work done under the D.T.D., but also to the Ministry of Supply establishment at Belper. This, it isalleged, has been another illustration of a dispersal of responsibility for design and of theintroduction of confusing influences. We understand that arrangements which have recentlybeen made, and especially the appointment of Mr. Gibb as Director-General of Armoured EightingVehicles, . are likely to clear up these confusions. Accordingly; we have not enquired in detailinto these aspects of the position. ! 1 .
(d) Faulty Workmanship).48. Faulty workmanship, however,, which must be considered together withfaulty materials and inadequate inspection, represents a trouble involving anumber of different causes and responsibilities. This has already been made clearby the illustration considered in paragraphs 23-29. It should also be noted thatthis matter is closely connected with design, and that if a designer is set tasks which require standards of accuracy and quality in workmanship which cannot reasonably be expected from manufacturers working with diluted staffs in war conditions, it is not fair to put all the blame on the latter. The story of Britishcruiser tanks and their armament seems to justify the comment that, beforeblaming the British workmanship, designers should devote more thought to thetask of ,evolving simple and robust designs. The reliability of the Churchill as now evolved, as well as of the Valentine, seems to show that it can be done.49. For the reasons given in the preceding paragraph we cannot acceptwithout qualification the statement made to us in evidence by the General staff that poor quality in the actual processes of manufacture has been a greater causeof trouble than any faults of design or vacillations in the programme. Sucha statement is an over-simplification in the apportionment of blame. Neverthe-less, we are satisfied that faulty workmanship, particularly in the products ofcertain firms, has been a substantial factor in the past, and we attach greatimportance to the conclusions on this matter which we have stated inparagraphs 22 to 36. We wish to emphasise most strongly our view that there isstill an urgent need for improvement in standards of material, workmanship and inspection. We consider that drastic action should be taken in specially badoases of carelessness in manufacture, and we trust that special attention will begiven to our recommendations covering these matters.(3) Lack of Urgency about the Tank Programme.50. There is one further general consideration to which we feel bound tocall attention. We cannot avoid the impression that, owing to the availability of large supplies of American tanks, which were regarded by the General staff and the fighting troops as satisfactory, there has, as a matter of general policy,been some weakening of urgency and drive behind the whole of the Britishprogramme. This is not easily demonstrable by specific examples, but is ratheran impression of general atmosphere which appears to have been felt throughoutthe industry. As one specific illustration, we have had evidence that in the matterof priorities as regards labour particularly in the case of sub-contractors those responsible for the Meteor engine programme have at times sufferedappreciable delays.(4) General Observations.51. At the beginning of this Memorandum we referred to the prevalence ofunfavourable comment upon British tanks. Although this is not a matter ofexpenditure, we cannot close without expressing our serious concern about this aspect of the position. It is not too much to say that there is a widespread feeling of depression about the situation. This is not an example of normal Britishgrumbling or of complaints confined to the type of men who are naturally inclined to discontent and defeatism. It is impossible to probe anywhere, even amongtroops of the highest morale and fighting quality, without finding it. In ourview, this is a very serious matter and urgent consideration should be given todevising means for dealing with it. It is not easy to make positive recommenda-tions as to what should be done. The only really effective remedy would be theactual production of a British tank which proves its reliability and fighting value in action, and much will depend on the qualities shown by the first batches of the1944 Cromwell tanks. But there are many things which clearly should not bedone. Some of these are apparent from what has already been said. In thisconnection a particularly important factor is the training at the A.F.V. school at Lulworth, since a great many officers and other ranks pass through courses here.We have already commented on the bad effect of training pupils at the School on equipment which they know to be faulty or incomplete. We consider that thesematters require special attention .
Recommendations.(1) The Immediate Emergency.52. As a preliminary to our general recommendations, we wish to representone matter of immediate urgency. At this critical moment when British troops are about to be sent into action for the first time with Cromwell tanks thereshould be a concentration of every available resource so as to ensure that, so faras concerns quality of material and workmanship, nothing is left to chance.Requirements in respect of these first issues of Cromwell tanks should havesuper-priority and be subjected to specially rigid inspection. It seems to us tobe of supreme importance that when the Cromwell tanks are first tested in battlethey should not fail in reliability. If they do fail, then, after the unfortunateexperiences of the past, it must be very doubtful wdiether the British cruiser tankwill ever be able to regain the confidence of the troops.(2) General Recommendations.53.   We put forward the following general recommendations : Organisation and Responsibility.(A) The responsibility for obtaining production of technical instruments ofwar, such as tanks, should rest with the War Office. The transfer of responsibility to the enormous organisation of the Ministry of Supply has revealed most serious disadvantages. These disadvantages have not been confined to tanks, but havebeen evident throughout the whole field of technical stores.(B) Pending the full implementation of the change recommended in (A),every possible step should be taken to create a close partnership in responsibility between the three main agencies the War Office, the Ministry of Supply and the manufacturers, and to give the dominating position in this partnership to theWar Office, seeing that it is they who are chiefly concerned with the practicalresults and who ought to be directly conscious of their urgency. It is not easy to devise the best method for achieving this purpose, but we put forward the follow-ing suggestions as indicating the kind of changes which in our view arenecessary : (i) The Tank Board should be made a more effective executive instrumentand should be so constituted as to recognise that it is for the War Office&apos;&apos; to call the tune.&apos;&apos;At present the Board appears to have drifted into the position ofa body for recording decisions reached by discussions at lower levels.There are too many separate pockets of responsibility in regard totanks, their guns, their other equipment, and the whole range of S.P.mountings. The Tank Board should be made more effective in pullingthese things together.The Tank Board should be as small in numbers as possible.The Chairman of the Tank Board should be a War Office repre-sentative, and on the War Office side there must always be adequate representation of recent tank-fighting experience.On the Ministry of Supply side, the C.A.F.V., or the D.G.A.F.V.,as &quot; managing director,&quot; for organising the production of tanks andtheir equipment, should be given full responsibility for taking the steps necessary to give effect in terms of production to the decisions of the tank Board.We still consider that, as formerly recommended, there would be advantages in having the D.G. of A. as a member of the Tank Board.(ii) The representatives of a few selected industrial firms should be brought in to all discussions from the very first moment when a new idea ismooted. The manufacturing responsibility has now, after four and a half years&apos; war experience, been sorted out, and according to ourreading of the position, it would be sufficient for the purposes of thisrecommendation to include representatives of three firms Vauxhall,Leylands and Vickers. Their representatives need not be members ofthe Tank Board, but they should normally attend all its meetings. Nodesign work should be entrusted to D.T.D. without simultaneousconsultation with the industrial representatives.
(iii) When it is decided that a new type of tank is to be developed and putinto production, the responsibility for parentage (including design,co-ordination of production and future development) should from the outset be given to a manufacturing organisation of proved efficiencywith an adequate team of engineers. The functions of the C.A.F.V.(through D.T.D. or otherwise) should thereafter be to assist theparent5s designing staff, rather than to work independently on anyfeature.(C) The organisation on the War Office side requires in any case to be made more effective.   The main objectives should be (i) To bring about, in the case of A.F.V.s and S.P. mountings, a closer unity of the responsibilities for the formulation of requirements;the conduct of tests and trials before designs are approved for production;the subsequent supervision of production programmes;all matters  concerning  the  handling  of  A.F.Vs.  and  S.P.mountings after issue to units, including training.(ii) To ensure that officers with recent operational experience are in contact with all stages.We deliberately leave this recommendation in general terms; but, as oneinstrument towards attaining the foregoing objectives, we have been impressed with the value of suggestions that have been put before us by various witnessesfor the formation of a comprehensive Tank Centre. Such a Centre would be organised so as to ensure adequate facilities for comprehensive tests, coveringgunnery, driving, maintenance, wireless equipment, &amp;c. We are stronglyimpressed with the disadvantages under the present system arising from thesplitting up and duplication of various tests. The regular provision of anadequte supply of prototypes and of the latest production models to the CentralTank School would be an important feature in any such arrangements (seeparagraph 51).Workmanship and Inspection.(D). -(i) Every possible step on the lines indicated in paragraphs 23-29should be taken to ensure first-class standards in materials, workmanship and inspection (both by I.F.V. and by manufacturers themselves) in tank production.The inspecting staff at I.F.V. should be drastically overhauled, and members ofthe staff with insufficient experience should be replaced by men with the necessaryexperience who are at present either in industry or in the armed forces.(ii) If manufacturers&apos; inspection standards can be improved by baking menoff production, then this should be done, It will be justifiable to face somesacrifice in quantity, if that is necessary, in order to ensure first-class quality.(This applies to manufacturers of components as well as to the main assemblyfirms.)Priorities.(E) There should be no doubt about adequate priority for everything that is involved in the agreed tank programme. This applies particularly to require-ments for the Meteor engine programme which is the key to the whole Britishcruiser hank programme.Links with Fighting Experience.(F) Constant attention should be given to improving and simplifying theprocedure for introducing minor modifications proved necessary by fightingexperience.54. The foregoing recommendations are not intended to be exhaustive; butas to the urgent importance of the objectives to which all of them are directedwe are in no doubt. Unless determined steps are now taken for improving theorganisation for Tank Development and Production, results like those of the pastmust be expected to recur with the consequence that money and war resourceswill continue to be wasted. Beyond this there is the serious danger that thecountry will, at the end of the war, find itself without a properly functioning
organisation for handling an extremely important branch of mechanical warfare.Such a deficiency may have incalculable consequences. That we should rely on american tanks to do the present fighting while we spend millions on makingBritish gun-tanks which are only suitable for training or conversion to other purposes is regrettable enough; but, looking to the future, it would be a nationaldisaster if the present reliance on American tanks were allowed to dull theGovernment&apos;s recognition of the vital need for building up a first-class organisa-tion and production machine for developing British armoured fighting vehicles.%th March, 1944.MEMORANDUM TO THE PRIME MINISTER BY THE MINISTEROF PRODUCTION.1. The Secretary of State for War, the Minister of Supply and I have considered the Secret report on Tank Production which the Select Committee on national Expenditure sent you on the 11th March. The following observationsand the other documents enclosed with this minute have been agreed between us.2. The Select Committee&apos;s report is diffuse and full of repetitions. Itseems clear (a) that the Committee cannot have had adequate evidence on which to base certain of their more important conclusions and (b) that on a number of technical matters they have formed erroneous impressions either by reason of the complexity of the subject or through their acceptance of evidence from outsidesources without checking this information with the Departments.3. The Committee gives an account of the results of tank production in1943 compared with their impressions of what the programme was at the endof 1942. In doing this they attempt to measure what they call the &quot; operationaldividend&quot; and give figures which purport to show that only 44 per cent, of the tanks produced in 1943 were &quot;operationally adequate as gun tanks.&quot; TheCommittee&apos;s measurement of the &quot; operational dividend &quot; overlooks : (a) the fact that since Tunisia British troops have not been engaged in anyfighting in which tank forces have been employed on any scale. If such operations had developed there is no doubt that a greater proportionof the 1943 output of cruiser tanks would have been used as opera-tional gun tanks even though they were not of the very high standardof the present Cromwells;(b) the need for tanks in large numbers for the training of troops.   TheCromwells produced last year have been largely used for this purpose.Centaurs, which except for their engines are identical with Cromwells,have been most valuable for training, and have enabled the more valuable Meteor-engined vehicles to be reserved for operational use orfor more advanced training. Many hundreds of Shermans have also had to be used; and(c) the operational importance and urgency of the special roles for which it proved possible rapidly to adapt the Crusader in particular.4. The Committee express disappointment that it was not until thebeginning of 1944 that Cromwells fully conforming to accepted operationalstandards were in quantity production, but they fail to appreciate that opera-tional efficiency cannot be obtained in a completely new design of a weapon socomplex as a tank without a long period in the hands of troops and progressivemodification.5 The Committee appear to think that the 6-pr. gun became obsolete atthe end of 1942 and ignore the fact that for the armour-piercing role this o&apos;Unremained throughout 1943 a standard general staff requirement for a considerable proportion of our tanks, The Committee&apos;s report was written without full knowledge of the latest types of special ammunition, which make this o-un a formidable weapon.II.General.Tank Armament.\
6. The Committee give great prominence to the delays which occurred in producing the 75 mm. M.V. gun and particularly its mounting up to a state of operational efficiency. It is true that there were difficulties and disappointments.The normal precautions and tests were applied, but this is one of the oases whereweaknesses were revealed in Service use which did not show themselves duringacceptance trials. The gun was approved as a general staff requirement inJanuary 1943, it began its tests in March and was issued to the troops in October.The faults which thereafter became evident were corrected by February 1944 andthe improved model is now in regular production.Faulty Workmanship and Materials.7. The Committee give a number of cases of faulty workmanship and materials and seem to have formed the impression that such faults are rife.Whilst it could not be claimed that tanks are or could ever be entirely free fromthis source of trouble, energetic steps have been taken by the Ministry of Supplyand by firms progressively to tighten up inspection arrangements so as to reducethese cases to a minimum.Organisation.8. The Committee&apos;s main recommendation is that the responsibility for obtaining the production of technical instruments of war, such as tanks, should rest with the War Office. This is under consideration by the Machinery ofGovernment Committee as a matter of long-term policy, but it is agreed by all of us that such a complete reversal of the policy followed since 1939 is not justifiedat this stage of the war by anything that has happened since the new arrangements at the War Office and the Ministry of Supply were made in September 1942.9. &quot; Pending the full implementation of the change&quot; the Committee urge that everything possible should be done to create the closest partnership betweenthe War Office, the Ministry of Supply and the manufacturers, the &quot; dominatingposition &quot; being given to the War Office. The fact is that the contacts providedby the Tank Board, periodic meetings between directing personnel and the dailypersonal interchanges at all levels have achieved a very real integration of theefforts of the two Departments.10. The Committee suggests that the Chairman of the Tank Board shouldbe a War Office representative so as to give the War Office the dominatingposition. The realistic approach to this problem is to appoint the best Chairmanavailable irrespective of the Ministry to which he belongs. Taking into account the personalities of the existing members of the Board and the fact that the sphere of executive action in production lies mainly with the Ministry of Supply,the War Office are satisfied that it is not desirable or necessary to ask for any changes.11. The Committee makes a number of other recommendations, which are set out below with brief comments : (a) The D.G. of A. should be a member of the Tank Board.   This has nowbeen agreed.(b) The fullest possible responsibility for tank design should be placed onselected parent firms. This is fully endorsed by the Ministry ofSupply, and indeed, it is their established policy and is well understood by parent firms.(c) The Ministry of Supply should not themselves undertake design work,but they should assist the parent firms&apos; designing staff rather thanwork independently on any feature. The fact is that with a singleexception, viz., Vickers, none of the firms concerned in tank manufac-ture has the specialist resources necessary to handle many of the designproblems connected with the fighting qualities of tanks, e.g., those relating to armament, armour protection, &amp;c. On such matters theymust, therefore, look to the Ministry for a large measure of help.(d) be presentatives of selected parent firms should normally attend meetingsof the Tank Board. This is already done from time to time whenoccasion warrants, but it is not considered necessary or desirable thatthey should regularly attend all meetings.(e) There should be an improvement of the organisation within the WarOffice and the establishment of a Tank centre with facilities for
comprehensive tests, covering gunnery, driving, maintenance, wirelessequipment, &amp;c. There is already a complete unity of responsibility in this field under the D.C.I.G.S. The arrangements between theMinistry of Supply and the War Office for carrying out trials and testsare working smoothly and, with the exception of facilities for gunnerytrials, the establishment at Chobham fulfils the requirement. Anentirely new Centre with facilities for all types of trials, embracingthose undertaken at Chobham, Shoeburyness and Lulworth, would notbe justified at this stage of the war.(/) The links with fighting experience should be strengthened. much attention has been given to this subject. As far as possible officers with recent operational experience are kept -in close contact with all stages of development. Extensive military technical services are maintained by the Ministry of Supply in all overseas theatres of war.These services act as a direct link between troops in battle and the design and production organisation.12. No one would quarrel with the view expressed at the end of theCommittee&apos;s report that it would be disastrous if this country, as a result of unduereliance upon America were to fail to build up a first-class organisation for producing tanks. With the growth of experience in industry and in government establishments this objective is being progressively achieved.13. Following the precedent established on the last occasion, I enclose for your consideration (a) A draft of a letter for you to send to Wardlaw-Milne; and(b) A memorandum of reply to the Select Committee for enclosure with thatletter.O. L.20th May, 1944.Draft Letter from the Prime Minister to Sir John Wardlaw-Milne,K.B.E., M.P.I have now received and considered the comments of the Departmentsconcerned upon the Memorandum on Tank Production which you sent me with your letter of the 11th March and which I have read.Your Committee will, of course, realise that it was not possible to give thema detailed reply in the interval between the receipt of their memorandum andthe Secret Debate on tanks which took place in the House of Commons on the24th March.Although a good deal of the ground covered in the memorandum wastraversed during the debate, I feel that the interest which your Committee hastaken in this important topic merits a reply more particularly directed to theirfindings and recommendations. I have accordingly had the enclosedmemorandum prepared for them.There are one or two general observations which I wish to make. Satis-factory American tanks were available in adequate numbers during 1943 andBritish troops were not engaged in large-scale tank operations after the Tunisiancampaign. These two factors removed, for the first time since Dunkirk, the fear of a quantitative deficiency which had previously preyented development of tank design and production on the lines we should have followed had we beenfree to do so. The situation in 1943 enabled a drastic reshaping of our tank production policy and this accounts in large measure for the fact that 1943output fell substantially short of the estimate made at the end of 1942.The Minister of Production, the Secretary of State for War and theMinister of Supply have, during 1943, kept jointly under review the workingof the new organisations which were set up at the end of 1942 and are satisfiedthat they are functioning efficiently and smoothly. The Ministers have advisedme that in their opinion it would be unwise at this stage of the war to handback to the War Office the responsibility for obtaining the production of alltechnical stores including tanks. I agree with them that such a major reversal of policy at this date would not be practicable or justified by anything that has happened in the last eighteen months. This is a matter of long-term policy to which full consideration will be given.
I note that your Committee had it in mind to present a further report tothe House of Commons. Whether they will think it necessary to do so now inthe light of what was said during the Secret Debate and of what is said in the enclosed memorandum is, of course, a matter for them to determine. But ifthey do decide to publish a report I would ask them to weigh their words witha full sense of responsibility at a time when great events are impending.Draft Reply to the Memorandum on Tank Production by the SelectCommittee on National Expenditure.I. The Results achieved in 1943.(A) General Comment.1. The Committee record their general impression that 1943 results,measured in terms of tanks fit for current battle requirements, have fallen far short of expectations, and been wasteful of expenditure.2. It is true that some of the expectations that existed at the end of 1942have not been realised in 1943, but the availability of American Sherman tanks inconsiderable numbers, and the pause in tank warfare since the end of the TunisianCampaign have given an opportunity of overhauling our tank production policyand placing it on a sounder footing. These two factors removed, for the first time since Dunkirk, the fear of a quantitative deficiency which had previouslyprevented development of tank design and production on the lines which, but forthat fear, would have been followed. The situation in 1943 enabled a drasticreshaping of our tank production policy, and this accounts in large measure forthe fact that 1943 output fell substantially short of the estimate made at the endof 1942.3. As regards expenditure, the Committee claim that tanks cost the Ministryof Supply 18-79 per cent, of their total expenditure on war-stores during 1942-43.The figure actually supplied by the Ministry of Supply and correctly quoted by theCommittee in Appendix I to their 14th Report was 17-69 per cent. But thisrelated not to expenditure on tanks, but to orders placed for tanks and all trackedvehicles in the year 1942-43. Expenditure on tanks as such represented 9 percent, and^l.8-79 per cent, of the Ministry&apos;s total expenditure in that period.(B) Prospect v. Performance.4.   The main points to be noted are :  (a) That the Crusader chassis proved suitable for special operational roles,for which no other existing chassis was available.(b) That the General Staff do indeed require Churchills as infantry tanks,and they are now in use in Italy.(c) That the Cromwell would have been used, if it had been required in 1943;but since there was little tank fighting and Shermans were available,opportunity was taken to submit it to prolonged tests and modification in order to bring it up to the present high standard.(C) The Operational Dividend.5. On page 5 of the Report the Committee gave a table in four columnspurporting to show that the operational dividend in gun-tanks was nil in the caseof all tanks except Valentines and Churchills and a few Matildas. This by itself is somewhat misleading. If there had been major tank battles since Tunisia, the picture would have been quite different.6. Moreover, the Committee&apos;s conception of &quot; Operational Dividend &quot; takesno account of the need for large numbers of tanks for training, which is itself animportant operational requirement. The 1943 Cromwells have been largely usedfor this purpose and the Centaurs, which, except for their engines, are identical with Cromwells, have been most valuable for training, and have enabled theMeteor-engined Cromwells to be reserved for battle-tanks or more advancedtraining. It is relevant to note that many hundreds of Shermans have likewisehad to be used for training.7. The Committee also do less than justice to the importance and urgency of the special operational roles for which Crusaders in particular have been
adapted. Vehicles for these purposes could not have been obtained nearly soquickly or economically had they had to be specially designed as the Committeeappear to recommend (Report, paragraph 19). Special designing and switchingover of production to a new type might, indeed, have taken 2 years or more.8. With these considerations in mind, the correct heading for the thirdcolumn of the table should have been &quot; Operationally used as gun-tanks.&quot; the table would then be substantially correct, though it would not prove theCommittee&apos;s contention.9. Under this heading the Committee make several comments on armamentdevelopment which can be more appropriately dealt with below in section III ofthis Reply devoted to armament questions.10. On the Cruiser tank programme the Committee comment on the tailingoff of the Cromwell production after mid-1944. Some tailing off will occur, butthere will still be substantial production of Cromwells throughout 1944, andmaybe into 1945. The A. 34, which will eventually supersede the Cromwell,should not have the serious teething troubles which the Committee expect, as itis based upon and follows closely the now reliable Cromwell design.11. The Committee&apos;s remarks on the Churchill developments are substan-tially correct.12. Under this heading the Committee comment on the impressions of delay and failure which they sense in the development of a satisfactory tank-gun.(a) The 6-pdr. gun.13. The Committee claim that, owing to its ineffective H.E. shell, thisgun has been considered inadequate as a general tank gun since December 1942,and they ask why there has been so long a delay in replacing it by the 75-mm. gun(paragraph 19). The fact is, however, that the 6-pdr. remained throughout 1943a standard General Staff requirement in the armour-piercing role for an appreciable proportion of tanks.(b) The 77-mm.14. The Committee recognise that this gun will give a better A.P.performance than the 75-mm., but state that the gun has not yet been producedand fired and its H.E. ammunition design is still under discussion. This mayhave been true at the time the Report was written, but both gun and gun mounting-had been produced and passed its C.I.A. test some considerable time before theReport was issued; the design of the H.E. projectile, also, is completed and the ammunition will be available when required.(c) The 75-mm.15. The Committee devote a considerable portion of their Report to the story of this gun and its teething troubles, and they claim (paragraph 13) 1(i) That there was delay in getting this gun with a serviceable mountingfitted to Cromwells and Churchills.(ii) That a design for mounting, which later proved dangerously inadequate,was approved for production.- (iii) That tanks were issued to field formations with the defective gun mountings and that this had a bad effect- on morale, as warnings hadto be given.(iv) That officers going through the A.F.V. school have had to be instructedon gearing known to be defective.16. The official General Staff policy on tank armament during 1942 required the tank gun to be a first-class anti-tank weapon and, secondarily, as effective as possible against personnel and lorries. Battle experience at the end of 1942and evolution of tank tactics caused a change and on the 3rd January, 1943, theGeneral Staff laid down that the main armament of the greater proportion of medium tanks should be an effective H.E. weapon, and, secondarily, as effective as possible against enemy armour. The rest were to have an armour-piercingweapon of high performance at that time the 6-pdr.IT. The Future Programme.III.&apos; Development of Armament.
17. The Ministry of Supply proceeded without delay to develop the 75-mm.gun. It is the case that there were difficulties and disappointments. The newgun began to be issued to troops within 9 months of the decision to adopt it(i.e., in October 1943). However, after its introduction into the Service, weak-nesses in the semi-automatic gear became apparent and to overcome these important modifications had to be introduced. To say that the consequent delaycould have been avoided by more extensive trials is to argue backwards. Trialswere carried out on the normal scale which has proved adequate for other gunsand this is one of the cases where weaknesses were revealed in service use whichwere not shown up in acceptance trials. The necessary modifications were rapidlyintroduced and the 75-mm. guns with modified mountings were in regularproduction by February 1944.18. In paragraphs 30-33 of their Report the Committee endeavour to assess the factors which have contributed to the disappointments that occurred in thecase of this gun. The Committee themselves clearly recognise that the matter is one involving complicated technical issues. While not agreeing with all theinferences drawn by the Committee, it is true that mistakes were made andwrong materials used and steps have been taken to ensure that the lesson willbe applied in the conduct of future trials, and in production.19. As regards the Committee&apos;s &quot; practical conclusions from the failure &quot;(paragraph 34), the following points may be made. The normal tests were carriedout. The design was carried out by the Technical Department of D.T.D. with full knowledge of the problems concerned. The trials were carried out under the supervision of OLA. and gave results which were considered satisfactory, andthese results were confirmed at the trial carried out at Lulworth in the summer.These trials were conducted by a combination of D.T.D. and the ExperimentalWing of the War Office Tank Gunnery School. Officers with recent battleexperience were present at the Lulworth trials.20. The Committee also comment on the danger of split responsibility(paragraph 35), the D.G. of A.&apos;s responsibility being limited to development and inspection of the gun itself and its ammunition. The line, however, mustbe drawn somewhere, and it should be noted that the relation of the gun-mountingto the turret and fighting compartment is even closer and more complex thanthe relation of the gun to the mounting. The addition of the D.G. of A. tothe Tank Board will assist the smooth working of the machinery for co-operation.IV. ^The Significant Points in the Results of 1943.21. The Committee pick out as outstanding &quot; faulty appreciations &quot; at theend of 1942 :-(a)- The decision &apos;&apos; to put all eggs into one basket&apos;&apos; and concentrate on astill unproved type of cruiser tank (the Cromwell).(&amp;) The decision to continue to rely for the major part of the programme on an engine (the Liberty) which on past performance was provedinadequate.(c) The decision regarding the parent firm for the Cromwell.22.   On these the following comments are made : (a) The decision to press forward with the Cromwell against a background of available Shermans has been fully justified.(&amp;) The Liberty engine had to be used at the outset of 1943 because no otherengine of sufficient power was developed and capable of being produced in adequate numbers for the tank programme thencontemplated. On the basis of a decision taken in September 1942 theMeteor capacity was expanded with the greatest speed that circum-stances allowed, but this expansion could give no yield of completeengines in 1943.(c) The Committee have apparently misunderstood the history of theCromwell parentage. It was the declared intention of the Ministryfrom an early stage to entrust the parentage of this machine to theVauxhall firm as soon as their commitments in respect of the Churchillpermitted. In pursuance of this policy the Vauxhall firm wereassociated with development work on the Cromwell from an early
date and actually built several prototypes. When, however, it became necessary to continue the production of Churchills and to embark on further development of this type of Infantry tank, it was clear thatthe Vauxhall firm could no longer undertake the parentage of thetotally different Cromwell. Steps were therefore taken as early aspossible to bring to an end the arrangements which had always been regarded as provisional under which the Birmingham RailwayCarriage firm had acted as temporary parents, and to transfer theparentage formally and finally to Leylands.23. The following are the specific answers to the questions posed by theCommittee in paragraph 19 : (a) Could not the decisions reversingearlier policy (e.g., as regards theMeteor engine programme) have beentaken earlier ?(b) Has it really been necessary, forthe sake of avoiding dislocation inemployment, to continue the productionof obsolete or condemned types ofvehicle and engine so long as has beendone?(c) When it was decided that certaintanks (Crusader, Cavalier, Centaur)must continue in production eventhough they would not be accepted asgun-tanks, was the task of preparingall the modifications and applianceswhich would be necessary for theiralternative uses undertaken with suffi-cient vigour and foresight ? We under-stand, for example, that the productionof Centaurs as gun-tanks has been con-tinued much longer than was intendedbecause the fittings and modificationsrequired for using them as A.A. tanks were not ready. Our evidence alsosuggests some confusion as regards the equipment and uses of O.P. tanks.(d) Lastly, and most important, thequestion already referred to : why hasthere been so long a delay in replacing the 6-pdr. with the 75-mm. gun ?(a) No. The decision to developMeteor capacity independent of aero-engine capacity was taken at the earliest moment at which it could be imple-mented, i.e., September 1942.(b) Even assuming that the vehiclesreferred to were fully obsolete or con-demned (which is not true), abrupttermination of programme would havedisrupted the production organisationof manufacturers to an extent whichwould have crippled the further pro-duction of tanks in this manufacturing capacity.(c) Yes. When a decision was takento discontinue the use of a model asa gun-tank, no avoidable delay instopping production of such gun-tanksoccurred. Production of chassis neces-sarily continued in advance of thesupply of fitments required for specialroles, which fitments frequently involvednovel and complex design and produc-tion problems.id) This question has been dealt withabove (paragraph 15 ff).24. The Committee&apos;s comments on the future programme for Cromwellsand A. 34&apos;s in paragraph 20 of the Report are answered in paragraph 10 above.25. Under the heading of &quot; the inescapable facts &quot; the Committee record the following impressions of the general results of the production story in 1943 : (i) That, apart from the Valentine used in Russia and the Churchill in tunisia, no British tanks during 1943 have been considered worthy of a place in the main battles.This is answered in paragraph 5 ff above.(ii) That British tanks issued to British troops have gained a badreputation both for mechanical reliability and fighting arrangements.This is a SAveeping statement which fails to take into account thesituation which this country found itself in after Dunkirk and of the many difficulties that have had to be overcome since then.(iii) That British factory workers have seen very large quantities ofcompleted tanks broken up or parts (finished and half finished) pilingup to be taken away as scrap.
This ignores the fact that after Dunkirk tanks had to be produced in numbers suitable at any rate for home defence in a time of desperateemergency. Such tanks fulfilled this purpose and also a useful trainingrole, but it is not surprising, and should not be a reflection on theorganisation in 1943 that Covenanters and Matildas of 1940-41 now have to be scrapped. The inference from the Committee&apos;s statement that it is quite common for British workers to complete tanks andthen see them broken up before being used is wrong. No finished tankshave been broken up before they have completed a considerable.mileagein training and other uses,(iv) That these things have combined to create a most Unfortunatepsychological atmosphere amongst workers and troops, which deservesthe urgent attention of the War Cabinet.Although such an atmosphere may unquestionably be encouraged by irresponsible public criticism, those who are. directly andcontinuously in touch with the workers on the one hand and the troops on the other are not prepared to subscribe to the views expressed bythe Committee. A great deal of reassurance has been given by recent developments.V. Lessons from Special Cases.26. The Committee comment in some detail on the lessons to be learnt froma short preliminary report they have seen about the 3,000-milc reliability trial.27. A. The trials are said to have brought to light a few serious designdefects, but &quot; a lot of very serious manufacturing faults.&quot;It is admitted that in some cases faulty materials and workmanship have found their way into completed tanks. Every effort has been, and will continueto be, made to eliminate them, and complaints of this sort have been greatly reduced. It is believed that the inspection system which has been built up andreorganised over the past year or more (see paragraph 41) will result in a continued improvement. Isolated cases of faulty workmanship and materials are liable to be exaggerated, and to draw the conclusion that the tank programme as a whole is suffering seriously from such defects would be a gross injustice tothe large majority of manufacturers and workpeople employed.28. 43. Parent firms, although held responsible by the Ministry of supply for the products of the whole group, have no established authority to controlworking methods of members of a group.The principle underlying this comment may be sound, but its practical application is a matter of great difficulty. The principle of supporting theauthority of the parent company is a matter to which the Ministry of Supply isdevoting constant attention.29.- C.   It is important to use the greatest care in selecting sub-contractors.This is agreed, but it should be remembered that the rapid expansion of the tank industry took place after the expansion of both naval and aircraft produc-tioii arid at a later stage of the general expansion of munitions production, sothat a number of firms who might have been the most suitable for many importanttank components were not available.30: D. There is a shortage of qualified staff both for inspection by theI.F.V. and inspection by manufacturers themselves, and this can only be countered by (a) transferring selected R.E.M.E. personnel to the I.F.V. and(b) taking a certain number of trained personnel in the factories off production,if necessary facing a loss in quantity to secure a better guarantee of quality.The shortage of trained personnel is admitted but it is an overall shortage(see paragraph 41).VI. Conclusions and Recommendations.31. Comments on the &quot;Main Conclusions,&quot; and the &quot;Recommendations,&quot;of the Report (paragraph 37 to the end) may conveniently be taken together.A. the Immediate Emergency.32. The Committee comment that it is of supreme importance that whenCromwell tanks are first tested in battle they should not fail in reliability andthat requirements in respect of these first issues of Cromwells must have
superiority. Any failure of these tanks would, in the Committee&apos;s view, finallyshake the confidence of British troops in the British cruiser tank.This is accepted in full and every effort is being made to ensure that thesetanks, when issued to operational troops, are in as perfect a condition as canbe achieved.B. Organisation and Responsibility.33, The Committee set as their ideal objective the reunion under the WarOffice of all responsibility for obtaining production of technical instruments of war, such as tanks.The Committee do not suggest in what way this transfer back to War office would in fact meet the ills they describe. At this stage of the war retransferof research design and production functions to the War Office would be littlemore than a nominal change since the same staff would need to be employed inmore or less the same places. Most of the problems of responsibility and liaisonto which the Committee draw attention would remain in what would inevitably be a vast production organisation under the War Office. In any case, now is notthe time to undertake such a complete reversal of the policy followed since 1939.34. Pending the full implementation of the change suggested in thepreceding paragraph the Committee recommend that everything possible shouldbe done to create a close partnership between War Office, Ministry of Supplyand manufacturers, the dominating lead being taken by the War Office.Such a partnership already exists and the War Office does in a real sensealready occupy the dominant position since it is the customer and initiates therequirements. Full contacts are provided, by the Tank Board, and at this level,as well as at all lower levels, a real integration of effort between the two Depart-ments concerned has been and is increasingly being achieved.35. The Committee claim that the Tank Board is becoming a less effectiveexecutive instrument than in the past. That is not so. The Board&apos;s executive authority is subject only to the agreement of the two Ministers concerned and ofthe War Cabinet where necessary. The Board&apos;s day-to-day decisions operatewithout let or hindrance. The executive functions of the Board are exercisedprimarily in, the Ministry of Supply&apos;s province, and therefore the Committee&apos;view that the Chairman of the Board should be a War Office representative maybe questioned.. It is the considered view of Departments that the realisticapproach is to appoint the best Chairman available irrespective of the Departmentto which he belongs. It may be added that the War Office themselves do not desire a change in the present constitution of the Tank Board.36. The Committee&apos;s view that the Tank Board should be as small in numberas possible is accepted, as is their recommendation that the D.G. of A. should bea member of the Tank Board. Their recommendation that C.A.F.V. orD.G.A.F.V. should be given full responsibility in carrying out in terms ofproduction the Tank Board&apos;s decisions is a reflection of present practice.37. The Committee recommend that representatives of select parent firms should, normally attend all meetings of the Board but need not be members.Such representatives have several times been invited to Board meetings to dealwith particular problems, but it is not thought desirable or necessary that theyshould attend all meetings.38. With regard to the recommendation that there should always be adequate representation of recent tank-fighting experience, it should be notedthat the War Office representation on the Tank Board does at present include an officer with outstanding experience of such a kind.39. Within the War Office the Committee recommend that there shouldbe a closer unity of responsibilities and that officers with recent operationalexperience should be kept in constant contact with all stages. The unity ofresponsibility to which the Committee refer is in fact attained under D.C.I.G.S.for all things which are the province of the War Office.With regard to the comprehensive Tank Centre which the committee recommend, the arrangements between War Office and Ministry of Supply forcarrying out tests and trials are working smoothly, and, with the exception of facilities for gunnery trials, the establishment at Chobham fulfils the require-ment. An entirely new Centre, with facilities for all types of trials, embracingthose undertaken at Chobham, Shoeburyness and Lulworth, would not bejustified at this stage of the war.
11 91 1 a/40. The Committee consider (Report paragraph 47) that the present divisionof responsibility involves the danger that the manufacturers may not feelresponsible for results, and they contrast this position with that in the aircraft industry where the reputation of the producer is closely knit with the perform-ance of the plane. It is to counteract this tendency that the recommendation that members of three firms-Vauxhall, Leyland and Vickers should normally attend meetings of the Tank Board is made (see paragraph 37 above).The Committee also recommend that immediately a new type of tank is decided upon, responsibility for parentage should be allocated to an organisation ofproved efficiency with an adequate team of engineers and that thereafter no workon the designs and development should be done by Departments unless inco-operation with the parent firm.It is accepted Departmental policy to entrust a new type of tank to a singlemanufacturing organisation of proved efficiency and thereafter to place thefullest possible responsibility for design on the selected parent firm. Only onefirm, however, has the necessary specialist resources to handle many of thetechnical design problems relating to the fighting qualities of tanks and firmsmust therefore continue to rely on the War Office and Ministry of Supply fora great deal of help. It is in general not the practice of D.T.D. to workindependently,, but rather to assist the design staff of the parent firm and towork in close consultation with them. The Committee&apos;s observations in factdo less than justice to the help given by D.T.D. to parent design firms on thefighting side of tanks.C. Workmanship, materials and inspection.41. The Committee recommend that every possible step towards improve-ment, where necessary, should be taken; that the inspecting staff of I.F.V. shouldbe overhauled drastically; and that it would be justifiable to face some sacrificein quantity of tanks produced in order to attain a higher quality and thereforeif necessary recruitment for manufacturers&apos; inspection staffs should be from theproduction lines (this applies also to sub-contractors.)The need for strengthening inspection staffs has been fully recognised.Industry and the Armed Forces have been drawn on for recruitment of inspection personnel to the fullest extent possible and the numbers of technical staff employed on tank inspection work were doubled between November 1942and March 1944. Man-power limitations are however very severe and the with-drawal of any substantial number of men from production lines or R.E.M.E.is by no means so simple as the Committee would suggest. Departmental policy,as developed in 1943, has been to emphasise quality rather than quantity intank production, a change in emphasis then for the first time made fully possibleowing to the circumstances outlined in paragraph 2 above.D. Lack of urgency: priority for the tank programme.42. The Committee record (Report, paragraph 50) their general impression that owing to the availability of Shermans there has been a lack of a sense of urgency and drive behind the whole British tank programme. That there hasbeen any such lack is denied. The Committee proceed to recommend that &quot; thereshould be no doubt about adequate priority for everything that is involved in the agreed tank programme.&quot; Up to the autumn of 1943 the tank programmeundoubtedly had a lower priority than aircraft, but since that date arrangements have been made in collaboration with the Ministry of Production for all essentialparts of the tank programme to be given equal first priority.E.- Lack of confidence in British tanks.43. The Committee express the gravest concern that such lack of confidenceis found even amongst troops of the highest morale. One positive remedy whichthey suggest is that the use of faulty or incomplete equipment for training purposes at the A.F.V. School at Lulworth should be given urgent attention.The Churchill tank has proved itself, and there is every reason to believethat the Cromwell will do so in the near future. It is admitted that throughforce of circumstances some faulty and incomplete equipment has in the past been used at Lulworth. This has now ceased and no complaints are now being received.
F. Links with fighting experience.44. The Committee consider that the procedure for introducing minor modifications proved necessary by fighting experience should be improved. TheMinistry of Supply, with War Office assistance, maintain in all theatres of warextensive military technical services which act as a direct and efficient link betweenthe troops in the battle mines and the design and production organisations.Further methods of strengthening such links are continually being studied.Officers with recent operational experience are kept in close touch with all stages of development.G. Result of failure to implement recommendations.45. The Committee finally conclude that unless determined steps are now taken to improve the organisation for Tank development and production, money and war resources will continue to be Wasted, and, what is worse, there is a serious danger that the country will at the end of the war have no properly functioningorganisation for handling this extremely important branch of mechanical warfare.It is agreed that it would be a national disaster if the Country were to failduring file war to build up a first-class organisation for producing British tanks.With the growth of experience in industry and in Government establishments this objective is being progressively achieved and the Committee need have no fear that every effort is hot being exerted towards that end.III.LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER FROM SIR JOHN WARDLAW-MILNE, K.C.B., M.P.Select Committee on National Expenditure.Dear Prime Minister, 10th May, 1944.I am directed to ask you when the Select Committee on National Expendituremay expect to receive a reply to the Memorandum on Tank Production which theyaddressed to you for the consideration of the War Cabinet on the 11th march last. Since the House has been informed that the memorandum the Committeesent you was on this subject, the pressure on the Committee for a report to theHouse has been continuous and increasing. The Committee are fully alive to theheavy burden which lies upon the War Cabinet at the present moment andunwilling to add to it, but they cannot properly discharge the duty laid upon them of reporting to the House before they are in possession of a considered replyto their Memorandum.Your sincerely,J. WARDLAW-MILNE.IV.DRAFT INTERIM REPLY FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TOSIR JOHN WARDLAW-MILNE, K.B.E., M.P.The replies of the Departments concerned to the Memorandum of your committee about Tank Production have now been received and will have to beconsidered by the Cabinet and by me. I regret I cannot hold out any hope thatit will be possible to give you a final answer on this subject while the pressure upon the War Cabinet remains so severe and in the advent of the very seriousoperations which are impending. Later in the Session t should hope that itwould be possible not only to give your Committee the reply to which they areentitled, but also to have a Debate in public upon the subject, in which it will notbe necessary to insist upon those restrictions which required our Debate to be heldin secret on the last occasion.&apos;!.v 1 &apos;
