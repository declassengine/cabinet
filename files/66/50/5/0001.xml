(44) 255. /l$th May, 1944. . , /WAR CABINET. WRESTRICTIONS ON PASSENGER TRAVEL.Note by the Lord President of the Council.1. At their meeting on the 11th May (W.M. (44) 63rd Conclusions, Minute 3)the War Cabinet agreed in principle that steps should be taken to cancel until further notice all conferences which involved travel by considerable numbers ofpersons, and invited the Minister of War Transport, the Minister of information and myself to consider what procedure should be followed in carrying out thedecision.2. I had a meeting on the 12th May with the Minister of War transport and, in the unavoidable absence of the Minister of Information, the parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Information. At this meeting we reached the following conclusions : (a) The Railway Executive Committee should issue a notice in the following terms to the Press on Monday, the 15th May : &quot; For some time past the pressure on the railways has been increasing and already a number of-passenger trains has had tobe discontinued. It will be necessary to withdraw without noticemany more trains during this Summer and they will be takenoff progressively. The public will, therefore, be well-advised toavoid travelling and, in particular, conferences involving long-distance travel should not be held.&quot;(b) The Ministry of War Transport should ask all Government departments to bring this notice to the attention of any promoters&apos; of conferencesin which they are concerned, and to suggest to them that they shouldcancel these conferences.(c) I should myself see the promoters of the Labour Party Conference andthe Co-operative Congress and suggest to them that these conferencesshould be cancelled.(d) The Ministry of Information should issue to the Press a note of guidance as to how to treat the notice sent out by the Railway ExecutiveCommittee and any notices of the cancellation of particularconferences. The Press should be asked to treat these notices asrelating to a situation arising out of the general and increasingstringency of transport over a long period and not as directly^ connected with forthcoming military operations. .3. We considered specially whether any exemption should be given toconferences which are directly or indirectly connected with the promotion ofGovernment business and which in normal circumstances the Government wouldhave wished to encourage. For example, the British Medical Association proposeto hold a conference in July to formulate their views on the governments proposals for a National Health Service. Our conclusion is that no exemptionshould be given and that all conferences should be treated alike.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S. W. 1,lQth May, 1944.[27475]
