SECRET   &apos; Copy No.W.P. (44) 281.30th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.OIL DISCUSSIONS.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.THE agreement should be rejected because-The proposal is more damaging than Mr. Ickes&apos;s plan to take a share of our resources (Lord Halifax&apos;s telegram No. 701).If we had given up a share of our possessions, we would have gained military commitments from the United States, which are rejected by this plan.The Committee&apos;s scheme gives us no benefit of any value.The present project is a monster cartel, but with no regulation of Americandomestic production.   The cartel is confined to &quot; international &quot; oil.The United States has more than 65 per cent, of world production at home,which would be free from regulation.Britain has no production that would be free from regulation.The United States will succeed in regulating production abroad and leaving it free at home.American consumption would be entirely excluded from the cartel, as theircrude oil imports equal their high-value exports.They protect their domestic market absolutely, thus making their presentimport duty unnecessary in future.The plan restricts international&apos; trade, confines markets and limitsproduction. ^U.S.A. gains : (1) Exclusion from U.S.A. market of Middle East supplies which can be sold there below U.S. supplies.(2) Exclusion from European market of Middle East supplies for benefit ofSouth American producers, representing one-third of total Europeansupplies. This act of exclusion results in protecting U.S.A. marketsagainst South American supplies heretofore directed to Europe.These South American supplies also can be sold in U.S.A. belowdomestic prices.Britain loses: (1) The right to sell oil in the United States if dollars are urgently needed.^(2) The right to sell in Europe in competition with the South Americanmarket there.(3) The right to increase British-controlled output except under international regulation.British interests, about 7 per cent, of world production, would be entering into cartel obligations with the United States, with 65 per ^ cent, of world production, accepting regulations which exclude, the U.S. domestic market, being65 per cent, of the world market. j ^B.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.
