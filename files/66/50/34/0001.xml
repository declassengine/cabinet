3 i j j 14.14. (^b * &amp; j4wa)THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT4Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944. 222W.P. (44) 284.30th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.CONSTITUENT REPUBLICS OF THE SOVIET UNION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE recent Soviet constitutional changes have resulted in the appointmentof Commissars for Foreign Affairs for the Ukrainian, Byelo-Russian and others of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union.2. M. Korneichuk, Foreign Commissar of the Ukraine, at a party given byM. Molotov to celebrate Red Army Day this year, begged His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Moscow most earnestly, and, as he said himself, very seriously, tohave a British representative sent to Kiev. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr repliedjokingly that he himself was prepared to take on both Moscow and Kiev, but . Korneichuk replied that this would not work and enquired whether the ambassador could not arrange for a Special British representative at Kiev.M. Korneichuk was in convivial mood at the time, but Sir Archibald Clark Ken-received the definite impression that he meant what he was saying.3. Some time later Sir Archibald Clark Kerr told M. Molotov what. Korneichuk had said to him and enquired whether this was to be takenseriously, making it clear that he was only mentioning the matter because of what. Korneichuk had said. M. Molotov replied that he would speak toM. Korneichuk and let Sir Archibald Clark Kerr know, adding that it would bea good thing to have relations between Great Britain and the Ukraine. He hasnot yet referred to the matter again, but Sir Archibald Clark Kerr considers thatthis does not show any lack of interest, as there has not been a good opportunityof doing so.4. We may be faced, therefore, with a definite request from the SovietGovernment to appoint a separate representative to the Ukraine, and should consider in consultation with the Dominions Governments what should be our attitude in that event. It would be well, too, to ascertain the views of the UnitedStates Government.5. It may be remarked incidentally that the Soviet Government may seek to draw a parallel between the new position in foreign affairs of the constituentrepublics and the position of the Dominions. In fact, of course, there is noresemblance. While it is technically true that under the 1936 Constitution theresiduary powers lie with the Union Republics, the powers given to the centralGovernment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are very wide and includewar and peace, foreign trade, economic planning, banking, money and credit,transport and communications, as well as the general control of foreign policyand defence; and the machinery of the Communist Party ensures that the relatively small residuary powers are exercised in accordance with the general line of Moscow. If an analogy is to be sought, it is to be found not in the BritishCommonwealth but in the German Reich as it existed between 1870 and 1918,where some of the constituent States were allowed to exercise a certain limitedcontrol in foreign affairs and in army matters, and for that purpose received and appointed diplomatic representatives.6. But, whatever the precedents may be, I believe that we should find itdifficult indefinitely to withhold recognition of the international status of thesixteen constituent republics. If a sufficiently powerful State is determined onsuch a development of its international position, other countries are likely to12378,   [27552]o secret. Copy No.   d 13
have to accept it whether they like it or no. It may be taken as certain thatit will be impossible to persuade all the United Nations to stand firm in refusing-recognition; once one starts others will follow and our position, if we stood out,,would cause great resentment.7. All the same, I see nothing to be gained in hastening such recognition.Moreover, there would be difficulties in regard to the immediate establishmentof separate United Kingdom representatives in the Ukraine. In the first place,we might find ourselves being represented as having recognised the UkrainianRepublics claim to parts of Eastern Poland. I am advised that, since theclaimed territory would only be a small proportion of the total territory of theRepublic, such a contention would not be good in law. But this might notavail to save us from a very awkward position. Secondly, if we establishedseparate representatives in the Ukraine, the Soviet Government might applypressure publicly to induce us to do the same for the Byelo-Russian Republic,which claims parts of Eastern Poland amounting to something like as muchterritory as the whole pre-1939 extent of the Byelo-Russian Republic. Thirdly,might not the &quot;Baltic States&quot; Republics put in similar requests for british representatives, when they were liberated from the Germans, which, if granted,would undoubtedly involve recognition of the incorporation of the Baltic states in the Soviet Union ?8. My present inclination is to try to postpone the whole question of the recognition of the independent status of the sixteen constituent republics untilthe peace settlement. If my colleagues agree, we should so inform the dominions governments and ask their views. If they concur, it would be well to keep eachother informed of any Russian move bearing on this matter, and we should informthe United States Government and ask them also to keep in contact with us onthe subject. The various representatives in Moscow should also be instructedto exchange information upon it.A. E.Foreign Office, 30th May, 1944.
