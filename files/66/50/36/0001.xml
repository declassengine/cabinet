Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.SECRET.&apos; :v.  Copy Wo.W.P. (44) 286.WAR CABINET.   &apos; :&quot;&apos;THE DUFOUR CASE.Memorandum by the Secretary%f State for Foreign Affairs.1. Nature of case.M. Maurice Dufour, a French national, instituted proceedings inAugust 1943 against General de Gaulle, Colonel Passy and six others, alleging,inter alia, maltreatment at Duke Street (Office of the French Bureau Centralde Renseignements Action) and claiming damages for serious assault and falseimprisonment and a declaration that he was not a member of the Fighting french forces. The principal incidents complained of took place in May 1942.M. Dufour alleges that he was kept in custody without food, that be was inter -rogated for hours at a time under a bright light, and that he was stripped to thewaist and beaten. These allegations, if stated, in court, would probably begiven great prominence by certain sections at least of the British press.2. A attitude of defendants.A written defence was put in in the usual form denying the charges andCounsel were instructed. This action may have been taken without consultingGeneral de Gaulle. However that may be, he subsequently refused to allow anyfurther steps to be taken by the defendants and ordered them to withdraw. his reasons are that he regards Dufour as a blackmailer, considers it beneath hisdignity to defend himself against the charges and feels that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should have sufficient sense of the respect owing to him as repre-senting France to stop the case. ,3. A attitude taken by Foreign Office in considtation with the Home Office.It is believed that Dufour &apos;s allegations are substantially true and that hewill very likely win his case.After careful enquiries the Foreign Office and the Home Office are satisfied (a) that nothing was known to the British authorities of what was going proportionate Duke Street;(b) that there was no reason why the British authorities should have knownor suspected what was probably going on; and(c) that as soon as attention was drawn to Duke Street by this and one or two other cases steps were taken to prevent any further abuses. Nothingcriminal is believed to have happened at Duke Street since the end of1942.Representations were made to the Foreign Office by the Counsel and solicitorsof both sides asking whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could not get the casedisposed of by a settlement. In view of the facts mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Foreign Office have told both sides that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad neither the power nor the wish to interfere with the course of justice.M. Vienot has been told privately on a number of occasions that general de gaulle&apos;s attitude is the worst he could possibly adopt in the interests of the defendants, since the Court were not only likely to find in favour of Dufour but would also take the view that the defendants were treating the Court with scantcourtesy. It is known that M. Vienot and some of the defendants, including12379   [27558] &apos;
Colonel Passy, have strongly urged General de Gaulle either to settle the case orallow them to fight it. He has, however, refused to listen to these representationsand &quot; sees red &quot; whenever the case is mentioned.The only active step taken by the Foreign Office in connexion with the action has been with the concurrence of the Home Office, Treasury Solicitor, WarOffice and intelligence and security authorities to ask the plaintiffs solicitoron the 20th May to ensure that the case did not come on before Whitsun. This,jvas done for military reasons, and the plaintiffs solicitor readily agreed. Thepresent position is that the case cannot come on before the 7th June and willprobably come on about the 20th June.   It is impossible to be more definite.4. Future action.In the circumstances described above I think it would be a serious mistake to intervene in any way in this unsavoury case. Neither the Foreign Office norany other Department was responsible for what occurred and after full considera-tion I think there is a good defence if it should be suggested that any british authorities have been negligent in not knowing about or preventing whatoccurred. We have nothing to hide and any attempt on our part to interferewould merely give the impression thSt we had. It will be unfortunate if general de Gaulle is here when the case comes on, but he has only himself to blame for that and we can hope that the press will have more stirring events to write up. If General de Gaulle&apos;s visit takes place before the case comes up,he should, when he is here, be warned of what is likely to happen. He mightagain be pressed to defend the action or settle it out of court. I do not think weshould do more than this.&apos;    , A. E.Foreign Office, 31st May, 1944.
