Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.DRAFT AGREEMENT WITH THE POLISH GOVERNMENT FORMILITARY SUPPLIES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will remember that I circulated a memorandum on the23rd January (W.P. (44) 47) about a proposal to conclude a Military SuppliesAgreement with the Polish Government containing a mutual aid clause on the. same lines as the similar Agreement concluded with the Czechoslovak Governmentin January 1943. The conclusion of the War Cabinet dated the 25th January(W.M. 11 (44)) was that we should postpone for the tinte being signature of this draft Agreement with the Polish Government. The reason for this decision wasthat we were at that time in negotiation with the Soviet Government aboutPoland and it was thought better not to take any step which might arouse theirsuspicion. Since then I have kept this question under review, and I understandthat the conclusion of the Agreement would still ,be warmly welcomed by the. Treasury and the Service Departments for practical reasons. An important resultof the Agreement would be that a large amount of the Polish debt (about 100 million) would be cancelled. This debt results from the supply of military equipment provided to the Polish Armed Forces under arrangements made withthe Polish Government in June 1940. I understand that the Chancellor of theExchequer is prepared to apply the same principle to the Czechoslovak Agree-ment, although in this case the sum involved will naturally be much smaller. Ishould welcome this latter development, but if we proceed with it our failure to sign the draft Polish Agreement would involve discrimination against the PolishGovernment not only as regards the signature of the Agreement to which the Polesmay well argue that we were finally committed, but also in our apparent refusal toapply to them the principle of a pooling of war resources.I think the time has now come to sign this Agreement, which will be of con-siderable practical convenience to ourselves. I regard this as a favourablemoment, since we are now less directly involved in the negotiations between theSoviet andiPolish Governments. In addition, the Polish Army has just made&apos;abrave contribution to our success in Italy, and I do not anticipate that the signing of this Agreement need provoke any critical comment either in this country orfrom our Soviet Allies.I therefore propose that I should be authorised to make the necessary arrange-ments for the signing of this Agreement as soon as possible. As explained in mydarker paper, I should inform the Soviet Embassy before signature.A. E.Foreign Office, 5th June, 1944.224SECRET. /  . Copy No. 3gW.P.
