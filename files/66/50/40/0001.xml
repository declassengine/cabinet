NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. A. US. task force has attacked two islands in the Central Pacific withcarrier-borne aircraft.There has been considerable enemy minelaying in the Channel by bothsurface craft and aircraft.One U-boat has been sunk, two probably sunk and two possibly sunk.Home Waters.2. Bombs and mines were dropped in Portland Harbour on the night ofthe 27th/28th by enemy aircraft, and an L.C.T. was damaged. U.S. ships were also damaged. The harbour was-swept and reopened at 2200/28. On the night of the 29th/30th bombs were dropped at Falmouth. There was no damage to shipping, but the British and U.S. Naval Headquarters were damaged by blast,and there were some service casualties, of which a few were fatal.On the night of the 28th/29th M.T.Bs. &apos;672 and 713 were damaged by anenemy mine in Lyme Bay. M.T.B. 672 was beached. H.M.S. Stormcloud(minesweeper) was damaged by mine off Worthing.North Atlantic.3. On the evening of the 29th the U.S.S. Block Island (escort carrier) andthe U.S.S. Barr (destroyer) were torpedoed 400 miles south of the Azores,immediately after an attack carried out by one of the escorts on a U-boat.Block Island subsequently sank and 1,000 survivors have been picked up by U.S.destroyers. Barr is in tow. Since October last Block Island and her escortingdestroyers had sunk or probably sunk eight U-boats and possibly sunkthree others.Mediterranean.4. Enemy positions south of Borne were bombarded daily by the U.S.cruiser Brooklyn, the French cruiser Emile Berlin, and U.S. destroyers, insupport of the left flank of the Fifth Army.Between the 22nd January, when the first Allied landings were made atAnzio, and the 25th May, when the bridgehead as such ceased to exist,478,407 tons of ammunition, stores and equipment were unloaded at Anzio.During the week ending the 28th May the total discharge was over 32,000 tons.There was slight shelling on two days.5. On the night of the 23rd/24th M,T.Bs. from Bastia sank a corvette offLeghorn and damaged a second; 19 prisoners were taken. A U.S. patrol craftcaptured a small Italian A/S boat off Anzio and took two prisoners. On thefollowing night a feint assault was made in the Civita Vecchia area, without incident, by a force of landing craft covered by coastal forces. U.S. cruisers and destroyers bombarded in support. On the three subsequent nights coastal forces operating north of Elba attacked two beached F-lighters and two corvettes anda north-bound convoy, sank three F-lighters, and attacked a 1,000-ton ship,leaving her on fire. Three M.T.Bs. were damaged. During the night of the30th/31st, coastal craft attacked two destroyers off Spezia.6. H.M. submarines have reported as follows : Vampire on the 12th sank a caique off Monemvasia (S.E. Greece). Upstart on the 21st sank the German(ex-French) s.s. Saumur (2,955 tons) off Port Vendres (Pyrenees), which had sailed from Barcelona on the previous day with a cargo of iron ore. Universalbetween Toulon and Marseilles torpedoed a beached escort vessel of the Elanclass (630 tons), which was believed destroyed.*East Indies.7. H.M. S/M Sea Rover torpedoed a 3,000-ton ship off. Penang on the 22nd.Pacific.Central Pacific.8- A &quot;U.S. carrier task force attacked Marcus Island on the 20th and 21st.148 tons of bombs were dropped. Only two Japanese aircraft were seen and bothwere shot down.  Four US&apos;, aircraft were lost.   On the 23rd the same task force
3238bombed Wake Island with about the same weight of bombs. No enemy aircraft were seen. Two U.S. aircraft were lost. Considerable damage to ground instal-lations was caused during both these attacks.New Guinea.9. On the 28th and 29th a U.S. cruiser and destroyers covered the landing on Biak Island (Dutch New Guinea) by U.S. troops. M.T.Bs. have been activeoff the coast shelling villages and sinking barges.Philippines.10. On the 30th a considerable Japanese fleet, including battleships, cruisers,and aircraft carriers in several groups, was reported in the Celebes Sea area andat Tawi Bay anchorage.Solomons.11. On the 29th Allied gunboats sank four enemy barges and completed thedestruction of 11 more in the vicinity of Empress Augusta Bay.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. Twenty attacks have been reported during the week, of which 12 wereby shore-based aircraft, one by carrier-borne aircraft, and seven by warships.A Sunderland sank a U-boat on the 24th, and two U-boats were probably sunk by a Catalina and a Liberator on the 24th and 25th; all off the Norwegian coast.Two U-boats were possibly sunk by aircraft on the 25th and 27th, one in theChannel and one off the Norwegian coast.Enemy Intelligence.13. Photographic reconnaissance of Gdynia on the 29th showed the lutzow,Hipper, Prinz Eugen, Leipzig and one Schlesien class battleship.The whole German fleet has been working up since January, including thetwo old battleships Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein, which were reconstructedas training ships in 1936. These could now be used operationally in the Baltic,but it is unlikely they would be used elsewhere.U-boats.14. The North Atlantic remains quiet. U-boat patrols appear to bemaintained in N. Russian waters.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15. One ship was sunk during the week in an aircraft attack on an eastboundconvoy off Algiers on the 31st. Three aircraft were shot down and a fourthdamaged.A homeward-bound convoy west of the Spanish coast was shadowed on the25th, and on the following day two Ju. 290 were shot down by aircraft from.M.S. Nairana (escort carrier).   One Hurricane was lost.16. Provisional shipping losses by enemy action during May were20,600 tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. During the week ending the 28th, 1,074 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 403 were in ocean convoys and 671 in British coastal convoys. Five escort-carriers, 29 destroyers (including six U.S. destroyers) and.125 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Five homeward-bound convoys, consisting of 208 ships, and four outward-bound convoys, consisting of 195 ships, reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.18. Surface craft have laid mines off the north coast of France and theDutch coast. Aircraft have laid mines in the Kattegat, in the Heligoland Bightand off the Frisian Islands, the Dutch coast, the north coast of France and theBiscay ports.[27571] b
Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.19. There has been increased minelaying activity by enemy aircraft duringthe week, and on four nights mines are believed to have been laid in areas offthe South Coast. E-boats were suspected of minelaying on two nights off beachy head.An R.C.N. minesweeping flotilla has cleared a mined area off Start Point.This is the first area to be cleared by a Canadian flotilla in Home Waters.The Russians are reported to have recovered German magnetic and acousticmines in the Black Sea.The mine totals are 4,830 ground and 4,688 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.20. During the first three months of this year there has been a marked increase in sinkings off the Norwegian coast. A total of 99,102 tons has either,been sunk or seriously damaged. This represents a quarter of the tonnagetrading between Germany and Norway.There has been a decrease in sinkings between the Elbe and the Hook dueprincipally to a decline in the number of available targets. It is reported thatthere is a reduction in the coal and coke available to certain Norwegianindustries working for the Germans.21. Iron ore imports through Bordeaux and Bayonne for Germanyamounted to 51,000 tons in April, a decrease of 12,000 tons on the March ship-ments. The iron ore trade in the Mediterranean between Barcelona and Franceshowed an increase in April.  Two of the ships on this trade have since been sunk.MILITARY SITUATION.Italy.     (An outline map is included as an inset.)22. Allied forces in Italy have continued their offensive against the enemywith considerable success. Troops from the main front have linked up with the bridgehead so that there is now a continuous front. Advances of 15-20 mileshave been made on the main front sectors, and in the bridgehead our troops have fought forward some 10 miles.23. Following the successful attack on the Hitler Line, Polish troops wereenabled finally to drive the enemy from Piedimonte, where the most desperateresistance was encountered, and on the 26th they occupied Monte Cairo. this move enabled New Zealand troops to advance up the road from Belmonte to Atina,which they captured on the 28th, and to continue their advance north-westwardstowards Sora, which was occupied on the 31st.24. In the Liri Valley Imperial troops, having successfully bridged theMelfa River, advanced towards force and Ceprano. Enemy opposition in thearea around force was most determined, but the town was finally captured,following outflanking moves to the north by Indian troops, on the 29th. canadian troops captured Ceprano on the 27th. British troops, pushing on through force,occupied Strangolagalli on the 30th, and continued their advance northwards.By the 31st, British and Canadian troops were entering Frosinone.25. French troops have continued their advance north-westwards duringthe period under review. From their positions on the 25th, some two miles north of the Pico-Fondi road, they captured Castro dei Volsci and Pisterno on the 27th.Continuing their advance on the 29th, their leading troops had entered Pofi andwere approaching Ceccano. The section of the line now held by French troopsruns through Morolo and through a point some two miles north of Carpineto.26. U.S. troops in the coastal sector joined up with the bridgehead onthe 25th when patrols from the main front encountered bridgehead patrols nearLittoria. This thrust caused the enemy to abandon the Pontine Marshes, and bythe 28th U.S. troops were approaching Roccagorga and had captured Sezze,Bassiano and Norma. So hurried was the enemy&apos;s withdrawal from this areathat he was unable to carry out any demolitions on Highway 7 (Via Appia), andthis road was speedily taken into full use by our troops.27. The attack north-eastwards from the bridgehead, which on the 25thwas threatening Cori, was continued successfully the&quot; next day, and by the 27th
5239our tanks had penetrated to Artena, some three miles south of Valmontone andHighway 6. U.S. forces who carried out this attack have since improved and strengthened their positions in this area, despite a number of severe counter-attacks. The attack towards Velletri which developed on the 26th hasencountered extremely strong enemy opposition and the town remains in enemyhands despite continued assaults. On the 31st an outflanking attack to thenorth of the town by U.S. troops achieved a marked and importantsuccess when they captured features in the Colli Laziali, which completelydominate the town. In the area of Campoleone and Carroceto U.S. andBritish troops have advanced some three to five miles. Campoleone has been captured by TJ.S. troops who are now two miles west of the village.British troops, attacking on the 28th and 29th, captured the factory area ofCarroceto and are now firmly established across the road Campoleone-Ardea.Between Ardea and the coast British troops have moved forward to conform with the advance made on their right.The Russo-German Campaign.28. The Germans claim to have destroyed Russian partisans in the rear of the Central Sector. North of Jassy a sharp enemy attack on the 30thsucceeded in penetrating the Russian positions, but there is nothing to suggestthat the operation was on a large scale.Yugoslavia.29. On the 25th the Germans opened a determined large-scale offensive in west Bosnia with the object of eliminating all the Partisans in this area andof destroying Tito&apos;s headquarters which was at Drvar. At 0430 hours, after a sharp bombing raid, an airborne force of approximately one battalion of para-chute troops and one battalion of glider-borne troops attacked Drvar. At thesame time German columns started to move against Drvar from all directions.The Germans soon established control over the main roads from Bihac to Jajceand Knin. Three enemy columns are now driving against Potoci (10 miles N.E.of Drvar) and the Partisan position is serious. Marshal Tito and the AlliedMissions have been reported safe.Enemy aircraft have been active in bombing roads and an airfield nearDrvar. Allied aircraft from Italy have given the greatest possible support tothe Partisans both in meeting their requests for bombing and in the dropping of supplies.30. Latest reports of the raid on Ml jet on the 22nd (see last week&apos;s Resume)show that results were not as favourable as first reports showed. The enemygarrison eluded our forces and the latter were withdrawn on the 23rd.31. The British Missions with Mihailovic were successfully evacuated by air between the 28th and the 31st.Greece.32. On the 24th, Zervas was attacked near Preveza by German forces whowithdrew, after suffering a few losses.Burma.Arakan.33. Activity has been of a minor nature. Our troops in the Kaladan have moved to new positions in the area of Mowdok, where they have been reinforced.Chin Hills and Chindwin.34. The remnants of the enemy who penetrated a brigade administrativearea S.W. of Bishenpur were not completely ejected until the 26th. During theweek our troops have been driving the enemy from their positions on the Imphal-Tiddim road. On the night 28th/29th, the forces moving north and south metsix miles south of Bishenpur.  A number of enemy were encircled and destroyed.In the Palel area the Japanese have made some attacks against our forwardpositions, which have all been repulsed with heavy losses. There has been patrolactivity only in the Imphal area.[27571] B 2
Our troops launched an attack against a hill feature immediately S.W. ofKohima on the 28th. An enemy counter-attack on the 30th has temporarily held up the advance. The weather has been bad and heavy rain made the goingdifficult.Chinese IU.S. Forces.35. The battle for Myitkyinacontinues. Further II.S. and Chinese reinforee-ments have arrived on the scene and the south-eastern exit from the town has beenblocked by Chinese troops.In the Salween area Chinese troops have captured Tatangtzu (about 15 miles.E. of Kaitou), inflicting heavy casualties. Kaitou has also been taken after some enemy resistance. The rains have now broken and the problem of supply is becoming increasingly difficult.New Guinea.36. On the 27th, U.S. troops invaded Biak Island in the Schouten Group.The Schouten Islands are 300 miles N.W. of Hollandia and lie off-shore fromGeelvink Bay. The initial landing was accomplished with light casualties. the subsequent advance met with heavy opposition, although this is now believed tohave collapsed.On the mainland, U.S. forces have consolidated positions near Maffin airfield(6 miles west of Arare). In the Ffollandia area U.S. troops have liquidatedapparently unrelated enemy groups immediately south of Sentani Lake.New Britain.37. Allied patrols on the N.E. coast of New Britain are now within100 miles of Rabaul.AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. For the seven days ended the 30th May, home-based and M.A.A.F.aircraft flew 50,048 operational sorties. Over 41,600 tons of bombs were dropped on Western, Central and Southern Europe. Heavy attacks were made on road and rail communications and against airfields and aircraft factories. Targets in yugoslavia were bombed, in support of Partisan forces.United Kingdom.39. On two successive nights raids by approximately 50 enemy bombersoperated against the south coast making shallow penetrations in the Weymoutharea and over the coast of Devon. Some of these aircraft were probably engagedin sea-mining. A small-scale demonstration was also made in the Falmouth area.Two enemy aircraft were shot down at night, and three others off the coast during daylight.Western Front.40. Our air assault from Britain, again aimed mainly against the enemy&apos;skey railway centres, his airfields and military targets, involved 15,546 offensive and escort sorties by the A.E.A.F., 9,656 sorties by the U.S. VTilth Air Force arid2,615 sorties by Bomber Command. Coastal Command flew approximately 700so?&apos;ties. (Total 28,511.) The area of operations extended to the Baltic aridPoland, covered a number of objectives in Central Germany and was widespreadover northern and coastal regions of France. A bout 23,000 tons of bombs were dropped, roughly 2/Srds of ivhich were directed on selected targets in occupied territory and the remainder on objectives inside Germany. R.P. Typhoonsdischarged 1,500 missiles. Totals of 177 Allied bombers and fighter-bombers and80 fighters are missing. In combat, 362 enemy aircraft tvere destroyed, plus 86&quot; probables &quot; and 98 damaged; an additional 70 tvere destroyed on the ground.-Note.

Martin-de-Varreville (325), Morsalines (300), Merville (290) and Eu (290).By day, nine targets were attacked with bombs totalling 1,150 tons; Fecamp, Caen,Boulogne and Calais received 120 tons each.(c) Airfields. In all, 2,750 tons of bombs were dropped. Rennes (300), inBrittany, was attacked at night, and 30 other- airfields during daylight, when themain weight fell on Rotenburg* (380), Oldenburg (340), Lachen (240), Zwischen-hahn* (170) and Brandistolenz* (40), in Germany.

During the week ended the 30th May, Allied aircraft of the M.A.A.F.flew a total of 20,047 sorties, which is a record; 133 aircraft were lost and192 enemy aircraft were destroyed.A sustained effort was directed against enemy communications; this was maintained on a maximum scale by medium, light and fighter bombers. heavy bombers concentrated on targets beyond the Italian borders.Widespread attacks throughout Central Italy were carried out againstrailroad tracks, roads, road junctions, bridges and viaducts; a total of 7,719sorties was flown. Enemy air opposition was relatively negligible and objectives were accordingly systematically attacked. Enemy transport and troop move-ments in daylight provided the Tactical Air Force with excellent targets.Accurate bombing of roads created road blocks and caused traffic jams; roadtargets, were freely attacked and in all 1,972 M/T vehicles were destroyed and1,674 others were damaged. The most successful day was the 25th, when over1,000 vehicles were destroyed or damaged. Railroad tracks also were repeatedlybombed and cut by low-flying fighter-bombers, and many hits causing considerable
damage are reported on roads, railway bridges and. viaducts. At nightWellingtons and other bombers bombed roads and road junctions in the region of Valmontone, Viterbo and Rome, and also the port of San Stefano.There were some enemy activity in the battle area, but this was not on animpressive scale and very few attacks were made on our land forces; on the 25th,26 enemy aircraft were encountered and 14 of these were shot down. In all 31enemy aircraft were destroyed in the battle area and Allied losses were51 fighters and seven bombers.South France.42. On the 25th, 26th and 27th, escorted U.S. heavy bombers attackedrailway centres in the South of France. A total of 1,405 bomber sorties was flown and 2,841 tons of bombs were dropped.; the bombing was accurate and overall very good results were reported. The targets attacked were the following :Carnoules, Amberieu, Lyons/Venissieux, Givors, St. Etienne, Nice, Lyons/Vaise.Lyons/La Mouche, Chambery, Grenoble, Avignon, Marseilles-St. Charles railway station, Marseilles-La Blancarde locomotive depot, and Nimes. The airfields atSalon de Provence and Montpellier/Frejorgues were bombed by 246 bombers.In the course of these operations only slight enemy air opposition was encountered; 25 U.S. bombers are missing and two enemy fighters were destroyed.Yugoslavia.43.   Support on an increased scale was provided, for the Partisans.Troop concentrations, supply dumps and installations were bombed with goodto excellent results by 330 heavy bombers at the following locations : Prijedor,Zegar, Zavalji, Bos Novi, Bihac and Bos Krupa. Zagreb railway centre andRazanik harbour were attacked by 55 and 29 Fortresses respectively.Fighters afforded close support for the Partisans particularly in the Bihac,Knin and Bosgrahoro areas; airfields at. Zemonico (near Zara) and Banjaluka(92 miles N.E. of Split) were successfully attacked.A total of 45 aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and 96 others were damaged; 154 M/T vehicles and six tanks were destroyed or damaged and 11enemy aircraft were shot down in combat. Shipping off the Dalmatian coast was attacked; one ship of 2,000 tons was left sinking and a siebel ferry was seton fire.Austria.44. On the 29th, 534 escorted U.S. heavy bombers attacked the Wollersdorfairfield near Vienna, and the Wiener/Neustadt Flugzeug Werke and Atzgersdorfaircraft factories; numerous hits were reported on the targets.On the following day 429 heavy bombers attacked a factory at Pottendorf, theaircraft components factories at Ebreichsdorf and Neunkirchen, the aircraft factories at Wels and Neudorf and the airfield at Wels; 857 tons of bombs were dropped with results which were good, to excellent.Opposition was on a considerable scale and 72 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of 12 Allied, bombers and six fighters.Twelve Liberators successfully laid 72 sea-mines in the River Danube.Rumania.45. On the 31st, a total of 488 escorted U.S. heavy bombers attacked oil refineries and railway facilities at Ploesti; hits were obtained on the targetswhere fires and dense smoke were reported. The following targets were attacked :Romano-Americana Oil Refinery (229 tons), another oil refinery (116 tons), UnireaSperantza Refinery (263 tons), Zenia Refinery (116 tons) and the Concordia VegaRefinery (215 tons). At Turnu- Severin 29 tons were dropped with very good results on the Romano-Americana Oil Refinery. In the course of these operations41 enemy aircraft were destroyed and 14 Allied bombers and four fighters are missing.Russia.46. Air activity over the front during the week was at a low level. AroundStanislavov a fairly large-scale air attack on rail communications and rolling-stock appears to have been made on the 26th May, and opposite Jassy, in the area
bounded on the west and east by Roman and Husi, a concentrated attack on airfields is reported to have been delivered on the 29th. In this latter attack theRussians claim the destruction of 60 German aircraft, for the most part on the.ground.The main feature of G.A.F. activity in Russia during the past week has beena continuance of night attacks on rail communications, mainly in the area betweenthe Pripet Marshes and the Carpathian foothills. These operations perhapsdenote a certain nervousness with regard to Russian reinforcements in this area.Burma.47. Allied aircraft for the week ended the 30th May flew a total of 2,053offensive sorties; 13 Allied aircraft are missing and three enemy aircraft were destroyed.Transport aircraft flew 1,575 sorties, carrying 2,360 tons, 4,855 men andevacuated 1,662 casualties.The decline in effort compared with previous weeks-was on account of thecommencement of the rainy season. Activity was centred primarily in theChin Hills/Assam and Myitkyina areas, where enemy positions were attacked and support provided for our land forces.Pacific.New Guinea.48. Between the 22nd and the 28th attacks on enemy concentrations, gun positions and stores in the Wewak/Dagua/But/Boram areas were made by atotal of 700 escorted aircraft. Airacobras operated at Hansa Bay on most days.A Japanese camp south of Hollandia and troops south-east of Aitape were attacked. Mitchells and Liberators hit the landing-strip at Babo, Dutch new guinea, causing large explosions.New Britain.49. On the 28th, 150 aircraft bombed the airfields and A.A. gun positions at Rabaul, which previously had been attacked several times during the week on a scale only slightly lower.Bougainville and New Ireland.50. Attacks in the Buka Passage area, on Matchin Bay and on BallaleIsland were maintained. Kittyhawks were active in support of our troops. Aradar installation on Dyaul Island (west of New Ireland) was demolished.Marshall Islands.51. On the 21st, 212 aircraft bombed Wotje, followed, on other days, byattacks by smaller forces.Caroline Islands.52. Objectives in this group were raided on several occasions. The heaviestattack was carried out by Liberators, which dropped 95 tons of bombs on twoairfields on Truk Atoll.Schouten Islands.  -53. From the 23rd to 25th, preparatory to the landing on Biak Island (videMilitary Situation), small raids were carried out each day and night. these were followed, on the 26th and 27th, by attacks by heavy bombers from Manus.On the next day, Liberators, in support of our troops, dropped 212 tons of bombs on enemy gun positions and other targets on the Island, while Bostons attacked enemy defences near Mokmer airfield. On the 27th, 17 escorted Japanese bombers attacked Allied naval vessels off the beachhead at Bosnek. Thunderbolts shot down one bomber and four fighters and naval gunfire destroyed four bombers.Kuriles.54. On the 24th, 25th and 27th, Shimisho and Matsuma were bombed byVenturas.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.55. On the night of the 27th/28th, bombs were dropped in the Weymoutharea and damage was done to house property. The District Hospital was hit andbadly damaged and the Christian Science Church was set on fire. On the28th/29th, bombs were dropped at Hove, where utility services were affected, andat Torquay, where damage was done to property, including an hotel. Casualtiesincluded 17 killed and seven missing. A military camp in Sussex was also bombed. On the 29th/30th, bombs were dropped at Falmouth, where two oilcisterns were set on fire. The fire required the attention of 26 pumps and was notextinguished until 2200 on the following night. Two hotels were damaged. Therewas also minor bombing in the Portsmouth area, in the Isle of Wight andin Sussex.Casualties.56. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours on the 31stare 21 killed, 7 missing (believed killed) and 30 seriously injured.APPENDICES I, II, III, IV and YI will be published periodically.APPENDIX Y.Casualties to H.M. and Allied Auxiliary Vessels and to Naval Personnel.28th May.-M.T.B. 732 sunk by accident.28th/29th May.
