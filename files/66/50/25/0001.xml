Results of Operations.1. German Cities.There were comparatively few heavy attacks on German cities during theperiod, but those that took place achieved considerable success, In the attack onEssen fresh damage was caused in many parts of the town and several workshopsof Krupps again suffered severely. The Gereon marshalling yard was the aimingpoint in the attack on Cologne and heavy damage was caused there and in the surrounding district as well as in the district of Ehrenfeld. This area in thenorth-west of the city had not suffered severely in the previous raids. Goodconcentration was achieved in. the attack on dusseldorf, which was carried outin clear weather conditions.&apos; In the attack on Brunswick &quot; J &quot; incendiary bombs were used for the first time..

2. Precise Targets in France.Some small-scale but highly successful attacks were carried out on precisetargets in France. In particular, heavy damage was caused in the attacks on the aircraft repair and. assembly plants at Toulouse and on the SignalsEquipment Depot for the German Air Force in France at St. Cyr. In the formerthe aircraft factory was completely wrecked, and severe damage caused on theaircraft repair plant and the assembly plant (see Print 1). The extremelyaccurate bombing carried out in the latter, in which all six sheds were completely destroyed, can be seen by comparing Prints 2 and 8.3. Railway Centres.Following on the heavy attacks on railways centres at Trappes, Le Mans andAmiens during the previous weeks a further series of heavy attacks on similarcentres was carried out during this period on all occasions when moon and weather conditions were suitable. In the great majority of these attacks heavy damage was done to repair shops and to the through ways and sidings and greatdestruction was done to locomotives and rolling stock. Prints 4-7 show thethe results of the attacks on Vaires on 29th/30th March, Lille on 9th/10th april and Tours on the 10th/ 11th April. A particularly successful series of attackswas carried out on the night of the 18th/19th April when great damage was caused in the railway centres at Rouen, Paris (Noisy-le-Sec) and Paris (Juvisy).The complete devastation caused to the last-named can be seen on Print No. 9,which shows the yards before and after the attack.One target in Germany, Aachen, was also included. This attack was particularly successful and not only caused great damage in the railway yardbut also in the town itself, which is now virtually destroyed (see Print No. 8).4. Results of Previous Raids.Prints Nos. 10-14 show the damage caused at Frankfurt, Augsburg andCologne in earlier attacks.C. Sea Mining.The number of mines dropped in April up to the 23rd April was higher thanin any previous complete month and reached the total of 1,927. Of these, over halfwere dropped in the Kattegat and Baltic. Sea-mining operations on the night ofthe 9th April were particularly noteworthy; no fewer than 499 mines were dropped by Lancasters in the Gulf of Danzig, a small number being placed, by low-flying - aircraft inside the shipping canal between Pillau and Konigsberg.Another;&apos;Ofiort by Lancasters covered the approaches to Swinemunde and Stiriingsand Halifaxes dropped many mines in the different channels at the entrance tothe Baltic and the Kiel Canal. Many mines were also dropped off the BiscayCoast U-boat bases, the Frisian Islands and in Heligoland Bight. This miningoffensive has had. considerable success in the sinking of enemy ships (Print No. 15shows two wrecks off the German Frisians) and also in compelling the enemy toput out a very great mine-sweeping effort to keep the channels clear.A.

SECRET. j       Copy No,--- /W.P. (44) 276.27th May, 1944.,WAR CABINET.FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL AVIATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN his Paper W.P. (44) 264, the Lord Privy Seal asks the War Cabinet todecide that the Civil Aviation Department of the Air Ministry should betransferred to the Ministry of War Transport six months after the end of thewar with Germany.2. Last December, as the Lord Privy Seal says, the C.A.T. committee decided the Paymaster-General, the Under-Secretary of State for Air and myself dissenting that responsibility for civil aviation should be transferred tothe Ministry of War Transport.3. The question was then referred, in accordance with the directions of theWar Cabinet, to the Machinery of Government Committee, who recommended&apos; see the Report by the Chairman, W.P. (44) 134 that responsibility for civilaviation should ultimately be transferred to the Ministry of War Transport, butthat (a) the current control of civil aviation should remain with the Air ministry for the duration of the war with Japan; and (b) that no public announcement should be made at the present time.4. At a meeting of the C.A.T. Committee in March, the Chairman referredto the Report of the Machinery of Government Committee, explained that the-conclusions were not, in his view, satisfactory, added that he had asked for it tobe held up until the matter had been reconsidered by the C.A.T. Committee, and said that he wished to raise the project of a separate Ministry of Civil Aviation.The Committee reached no firm decision on this issue.5. Three statements have been made in Parliament this year on behalf of theGovernment: (a) On the 19th January, the Lord Privy Seal said : &apos;&quot; I think the whole House has agreed that there should notbe any plan or proposal for removing civil aviation from the care of the Air Ministry during the war.  If that is so, it seems to me* quite foolish and futile to discuss the future of civil aviation inrelation to the Air Ministry at this time.&quot;(b) On the 19th March, I said that responsibility for civil air transport rests,and must rest, with the Secretary of State for Air for the duration of the war; and(c) on the 5th April, the Deputy Prime Minister said that &quot;there is noquestion of removing civil aviation from the care of the Air Ministryduring the war.&quot;The words &apos;&apos; during the war &quot; in these statements mean  and were generallyinterpreted as meaning for the duration of the war with Germany and Japan.Certainly, as the Machinery of Government Committee appreciated, the practicalcase for leaving the current control of civil aviation with the Air Ministry until after the war with Japan is overwhelming. The direction of current operations and the planning of long-term policy are closely related in fact, indivisible.Current administration demands an intimate knowledge of the work that is proceeding on future planning and vice versa.[27537]Printed for the War Cabinet.
