Aircraft Carriers Disposition and Movements.(Events to 18th February were covered in previous summary.)1. Fleet Carriers.H.M.S. VictoriousH.M.S. Furious(i) On the 3rd April the German Battleship Admiralvon Tirpitz was attacked by a striking force flown from.M.S. Victorious and HM.S. Furious, supported by the escort carriers Emperor, Searcher, Pursuer and Fencer.Forty Barracudas, taking part in their first largeoperation, made dive-bombing attacks in two wavesunder escort of Corsair, Hellcat and Wildcat fighters,while sea fires and some Corsairs flew defensive patrolsover the fleet during the operation. Weather conditions were excellent and there was no fighter opposition to the attack. Escort fighters were consequently able to concentrate on keeping down enemy flak. Ninety-eightbombs ranging in size from 500 lbs. to 1,600 lbs. were dropped, and a conservative assessment of results allowedeight certain plus five probable bomb hits; possibly therewas also a considerable number of additional hits frombombs which burst between decks and could not be identified-fied. The certain hits included three with 1,600-lb. A.P.bombs.&apos; It is estimated that at least 3-5 months will berequired to effect temporary repairs and that permanentrepairs will take considerably longer. Four aircraft were lost during the operation : two Barracudas by enemy action during the attacks, one Barracuda crashedon taking off and one fighter was forced to land in thesea, the pilot being rescued.(ii) A sweep of the Norwegian leads early on the26th April by aircraft from H.M.S. Victorious, Furious,Searcher, Pursuer and Striker resulted in an attack ona German convoy of four merchant ships with escorts offBodo. All four merchantmen were hit, and one ship wasafterwards seen to be beached and on fire. In additionto the attack on the convoy, Barracudas and Corsairsfrom H.M.S. Victorious penetrated into Bodo Harbour,where a 6,000-ton merchant vessel was hit and left on fireamidships. The motor vessel La Plata, beached andderelict on Bodo Island, was also attacked and hit.   A[27468Jr
total of 27 Barracudas and 56 fighters took part in this operation. One Barracuda and four of the fighter escortare missing.(iii) Later in the day Corsairs from H.M.S. Victoriousattacked and set on fire a 4,000-ton tanker in VaagsFiord.H.M.S. Illustrious (iv) H.M.S. Illustrious and U.S.S. Saratoga, sup-ported by a powerful force of battleships and escortsof the Eastern Fleet, attacked the Japanese-occupiedisland of Sabang and the neighbouring airfield, Lho Nga,on the 19th April with a mixed force of British and .^American aircraft. The enemy was surprised, and at JSabang two 1,000-lb. bombs scored direct hits on medium-sized merchant ships; two destroyers and one escort vessel were set on fire; the Radio and Radar stations were severely damaged and twenty-one aircraft were destroyed on the ground. In addition, considerable damage was done to barracks, &amp;c, in the dock area, andthe power station and an oil fuel tank were also hit.Severe fires were left burning, with smoke rising to7,000 ft. At Lho Nga airfield, which is situated onthe nearby island of Sumatra, three other aircraft outof a total of five observed were destroyed.The attacking force lost only one aircraft : a UnitedStates navy fighter which forced-landed in the sea, butwhose pilot was picked up by the submarine Tactician,which carried out the rescue under fire from shore batteries. Eleven of our aircraft were damaged by flak,but ten of these were subsequently repaired on board.As the force withdrew three enemy torpedo-bombersapproached the fleet, but were all shot down by fightersbefore they could attack.ELM.S. Indomitable      (v) After completion of repairs in the United States(see last report) H.M.S. Indomitable has sailed for theUnited Kingdom to work up in the Clyde for subsequentduties with the Eastern Fleet.H.M.S. Formidable      (vi) Due to complete her refit at Belfast on the23rd May and subsequently to join the Eastern Fleet.H.M.S. Indefatigable    (vii) Acceptance trials proceeding after a break fornecessary alterations.   Expected to be ready for service by July.&apos;H.M.S. Implacable       (viii) New carrier completing.   Expected to corn-mission for trials the 22nd May.2. Escort Carriers.(i) During the period under review ten escort carriers have been engaged on trade Protection duties with North Atlantic and.Russian convoys. Six enemy aircraft attempting to shadow convoys were destroyed, and four submarines were destroyed for certain in a large number of attacks.(ii) The outstanding work done by H.M.S. Activity, Chaser and Tracker,particularly in the destruction of enemy reconnaissance aircraft and in theirpersistent attacks on U-boats, contributed largely to the safe conduct of theRussian convoys. The flying conditions in the northern latitudes in Arcticconditions have often been severe and the arduous work of the carriers and air-crews has earned high praise. H.M.S. Chaser was subsequently damaged through )grounding in Scapa Flow in a gale on the 13th March, and will take some months to repair.(iii) Four of the Escort Carriers equipped with fighters for the support of     &apos;amphibious operations, have been operating with the Home Fleet in offensive operations off the Norwegian Coast (vide paragraph 1).  Three others have carriedout a period, of intensive training in large-scale exercises with the Army inNorthern Ireland. *(iv) Three additional Escort Carriers have now joined the Eastern Fleetfor anti-U-Boat operations, making a total of four. One of these, H.M.S. Battler,assisted in the destruction of an enemy supply ship and attacked an enemyU-Boat, which was&apos;apparently damaged.
(v) Other Escort Carriers have been employed in transporting reserve and replacement aircraft from the United States to the United Kingdom and to theFar East.(vi) H.M.S. Slinger, mined in the North Sea on the 5th February, is expectedto be ready for service in July after repairs to extensive damage.(vii) The two Deck Landing Training Carriers working in the Clyde havequalified 244 new pupils and given Refresher Courses to 85 others.(viii) H.M.S. Pretoria Castle has continued to carry out her duties as aTrials Carrier and is now undergoing a short refit.3. M.A.C. Ships.Three more M.A.C. ships have come into service, making a total of 17. Theyhave continued their valuable support to North Atlantic convoys.The requirement for using these ships as aircraft transports from the UnitedStates to the United Kingdom (see previous report) has now lapsed but may be revived.Section II. Detached Naval Squadrons, &amp;c, Operating from Shore Bases.4. Arrangements have been made for the Fleet Air Arm to help the RoyalAir Force in forthcoming operations. Details of these will be given in thenext report.Section III.-Aircraft.5. British Aircraft.(i) The folding wing Seafire Mk. Ill is now in general supply and isreplacing the older marks of Seafire. Eight squadrons have now been re-equipped.(ii) The Seafire XV prototype has successfully carried out deck landing trials.(iii) A Mosquito aircraft, specially equipped for deck landing, has been landed successfully by a Naval pilot on board H.M.S. Indefatigable. little difficulty was experienced in landing the aircraft in lightly-loaded condition butthe take-off was more difficult. Trials will be resumed this month, with heavierloads, to represent operational conditions.6. American Aircraft.The question of further assignments of American aircraft to the Fleet air arm is now being reviewed in Washington and it is hoped that increased assign-ments, which are badly needed, will be agreed.[27468]
