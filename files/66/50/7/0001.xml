SECRET. &apos; Copy, No.W.P. (44) 257.l%th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF A REFUGEE CAMP in tripolitania.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I should be grateful for the views of my colleagues in the followingmatter : -2. In April 1943 the Anglo-American Conference met in Bermuda torecommend steps to deal with the international refugee question. One of theprincipal problems was (and emphatically still is) the establishment of adequatereception camps or centres for the temporary reception of many thousands ofthose refugees from German oppression for whose maintenance His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have, in conjunction with the United States Government, undertakenresponsibility. The British Delegation agreed to recommend for reconsiderationa proposal made by the United States Delegation that a refugee centre shouldbe established in Cyrenaica. A similar proposal had been made at the beginningof the year by the Greek Government, but had been opposed by the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, at a time when the area was in, or near, the scene ofmilitary operations. At the same time both Delegations undertook to recommend to their respective military authorities that they should authorise the establishmentof a refugee centre in North Africa, at Fedhala near Mogador, to receive refugees who had escaped from German-occupied Europe into Spain and who constituted a source of friction with the Spanish authorities. Resistance to this latterproject, however, was encountered from the United States military authorities.After further inter-departmental discussion a recommendation was submittedto the Prime Minister that he should send a personal telegram to the Presidenturging the importance of securing a favourable decision on the Fedhala camp.This was done, and a reply was received from the President on the 10th July, 1943,agreeing to the establishment of the camp, but at the same time recording hisunderstanding that the possibility of using Cyrenaica and Tripolitania for theestablishment of similar refugee centres was being studied by the british authorities. It was plain that the President regarded this latter development as being in the nature of a return for his assistance in prevailing upon theUnited States, and also the French, authorities to agree to the establishment ofthe Moroccan centre, to which refugees from Spain are now about to be sent.3. The question of the establishment of refugee camps in Cyrenaica andTripolitania was thereupon referred to the Minister Resident in the Middle East.As regards Cyrenaica the objections, in particular friction with the local Arabinhabitants, are substantial, but they appear to me to be much less so in respectof Tripolitania. The Minister Resident and the militaiy authorities in theMiddle East, however, maintained their objections on the ground that, though a camp could be&apos; provided, it would be at the expense of military operational requirements. In October the matter was taken up with the War Office, and finally, in view of direct representations from the United States Embassy at theend of March of this year, personally with the Secretary of State for War, who,however, maintained the previous military objections.4. The reasons for requiring the camp,- the objections and the overridingadvantages may be recapitulated -as follows.

It was understood by the Britishand United States Delegations at&quot; the Bermuda Conference that they should12366   [27479], -
recommend respectively the establishment of refugee ,centres in Cyrenaica andTripolitania on the one hand and in Morocco on the other, on a basis of theadministration and maintenance, &amp;c., being shared equally between the twoGovernments. It was also understood that in return for American assistancein securing the Moroccan camp, to which we attach much importance in orderto clear Spain of refugees, we should establish a camp in either Tripolitania orCyrenaica. Cyrenaica, however, proved unworkable; but the political objectionsin the case of Tripolitania are, in my view, not at all insuperable, while theforce of the military objections (e.g.,, difficulty of supplies and shipping and personnel) would seem to be much diminished by the fact that complete UnitedStates co-operation in all these spheres, as also in finance, is assured. Moreover,apart from the importance of His Majesty&apos;s Government fulfilling their side ofa bargain with the United States Government, the establishment of the campis likely to prove of great importance for the future. Already large numbers of refugees are leaving Yugoslavia. Accommodation will have to be found forthem and there is the further possibility of an increasing outflow of Jews from various points in the Balkans. Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon are all&apos;playing their part in accommodating large numbers of refugees for whom His ^Majesty&apos;s Government assumed responsibility. I am of the opinion thatTripolitania, too, must be brought into the scheme, and. that, particularly inview of American desires and assurances of help, the military objections areoutweighed by considerations of general policy and the importance of main-taining equal co-operation between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the UnitedStates Government in questions affecting refugees.A.
