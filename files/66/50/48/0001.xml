TOP SECRET.[J.I.C. (44) 218 (0).   (Final.)]27 th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.To Right Hon. C. R. Attlee, M.P.,Lord President of the Counciland Deputy Prime Minister.THE OIL POSITION IN AXIS EUROPE, FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 1944.Report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.THERE is attached a Report* upon the oil position in Axis Europe whichhas been prepared by the Technical Sub-Committee on Axis Oil, of which sir Harold Hartley is Chairman. The Report gives the final statistics for theyear 1943, calculated according to the best information available, and productionand consumption trends are estimated for the first six months of 1944. Theprobable position that may arise under various circumstances is also indicated.2.   The conclusions of the Report are summarised on page 3.3. There is considerable evidence from intelligence to support the TechnicalSub-Committee&apos;s conclusion that Germany&apos;s oil position has recently taken avery marked turn for the worse :  (a) Towards the end of 1943 there were frequent reports of shortages of fuelfor the motor transport of German divisions in the Balkans.(&amp;) For some time past units of the German armed forces have been on a monthly quota basis. Early this year there were indications that insome cases at least quotas of fuel previously allotted to units were infuture to be reduced.(c) In the past month or so there has been evidence that the training of somedivisions in the West had been considerably interfered with by fuelshortages.(d) There has recently been evidence of a substantial cut in the allocation of oil for the German navy.(e) A further proportion of certain types of motor transport of military units in the West, including that of battle units, was being fitted with woodfuel generators for use, if required, as an alternative means of power.(/) After the recent successful attack on Ploesti, when three of the principalrefineries were left burning for over 60 hours, and on hydrogenationplants in Germany, flak destined for Luftflotte 3, which is responsiblefor air defences in the West, and flak hitherto guarding three of theprincipal German aircraft factories was diverted to protecthydrogenation plants in Germany which had not then been attacked.4. It is clear from the above that the Germans are fully alive to the weakness of their oil position and that this position is sufficiently serious to necessitateprecautions and further cuts in oil allocations to a point where operational efficiency is already beginning to be affected.5. One problem which must be causing grave concern to the Germans isthat the main hydrogenation plants are large and easily identifiable and, thatthe danger and effects of air bombing cannot, as in the case of other industries* a.o. (44) 41.
such as the aircraft industry, be mitigated by their dispersal. The german air Force has always been dependent on the production from synthetic sources and now in the present position of the Roumanian refineries the Army will alsobe dependent on synthetic production for the bulk of its supply.6. The difficulty is to assess on even an approximate basis how soon oilshortage will have a direct and appreciable effect on Germany&apos;s military strategy and operations in the field. This depends on a number of indeterminate factors.For example : (a) The margin of error which is inevitable in an assessment over so widea field as that which the Technical Sub-Committee had to cover;(&amp;) The intensity of military operations and consequent increased oil con-sumption forced on the Germans;(c) The extent to which the progress of the land lighting will deprive theGermans of sources of oil supply from oilfields behind the eastern front, and the success and timing of any Allied bombing attacks against the principal synthetic plans.7. Although, for the above-mentioned reasons it is impossible to be preciseon the time factor, we feel convinced that there is now sufficient evidence tojustify the conclusion that a concerted and successful attack on Germany&apos;s sources of oil production would, within a period of from 3 to 6 months, produce ashortage of oil so serious that it would render it impossible for her to carry outfull-scale operations on three major fronts. Even two or three further attacks on the German synthetic plants as effective as those on the 12th May, and a continuation of the bombing of Ploesti, would increase the overall oil deficitto a point which would compel the Germans to fall back on their scanty strategicreserves estimated at about 2 months&apos; requirements. Both on the &quot;short andon the long view, oil has therefore become a vital factor in German resistance.(Signed) V. CAYENDISH-BENTINCK.E. G. N. RUSHBRQOKE.J. A. SINCLAIR.F. F. INGLIS.M. Y.

Summary of Conclusions.1. Excluding military strategic reserves, stocks of oil in Axis Europe areat not more than the distributional minimum.2. The reserves held by the armed forces are likely to be sufficient, if cutoff from other sources of supply, to maintain active fighting for from one to twomonths.3. As a result of the attacks on Eoumania in April and on five synthetic oil plants on the 12th May, it is estimated that a surplus of production overconsumption of about 155,000 tons per month in April has been converted into a deficit of about 65,000 tons in May, or equal to 5 per cent, below current consumption. There is likely to be a deficit of similar size in June if production is not further reduced or military consumption increased.4. After allowing for the possibility that the damaged plants might be repaired within a short time, there is no possibility of any short-term substantial increase in production. Any further important cuts in non-military consumption would have results as serious but not so immediate to the war effort as cuts in military consumption.5.   The loss of Roumanian, Polish and Estonian oil would *(a) result in a reduction of supplies equal 10^260,000 tons a month,* or21 per&apos;cent, of present total consumption;(6) cause a general dislocation of the oil distribution system and seriousshortages of certain petroleum products, especially motor fuel, whichwould be short to the extent of over one million tons, or 26 per cent.of present army consumption;(c) enhance the importance to Germany of her synthetic oil production uponwhich she would become dependent for 56 per cent, of her total supplies.6. If a general Allied offensive starts on both the Eastern and Westernfronts, military consumption would be increased above present levels by about150,000 tons per month, or by 22 per cent.7. If (5) and (6) should occur at about the same time, Germany would be faced with her consumption requirements being over 50 per cent, in excess oftotal production. This deficit would be equivalent- to about 90 per cent, of thetotal non-military consumption of Axis Europe. Within two ,to three months,depending on the circumstances, military supplies would have to be cut to an extent that would cause a most serious contraction in operational mobility.* This figure does not take into account any allowance for the present dislocation in roumania. If Roumanian output has been cut by 50 per cent..as a result of air attacks, thenthese supplies are at present reduced by 160,000 tons.[27474 j
REPORT.INTRODUCTORY.Our last report on the oil position in Axis Europe (J.I.C. (43) 463) was submitted in November last. It detailed the statistical position for the firsteight months of 1943, indicated the trend for the remainder of the year, and suggested possible developments that might occur during the first quarter of 1944.We concluded that, in spite of the efforts that have been made to provide for asufficiency of oil. this had not been achieved and stocks at the end of the year were at not more than the distributional minimum. It was anticipated that, providedprogress was made with the construction of the new synthetic oil plants, the rateof production in the early part of 1944 would exceed consumption and therewould be some recovery in the depleted stock position.REPORT.The following report gives the final statistics for the year 1943, calculatedaccording to the best information available, and production and consumptiontrends are estimated for the first six months of 1944.. The probable position thatmay arise under various circumstances is also indicated.The Position in 1943.In order to depict the status of the German oil pdsition at the end of 1943,it is necessary to review briefly the course of events following the failure tosecure the Caucasus in the autumn of 1941. Up to the end of 1942 consumptionsubstantially exceeded production and reserves became depleted to a criticalextent at the end of that year. By this time it was evident that Germany had lost the initiative, and thoie responsible for the administration of oil suppliesmust have realised that, without the prospect of being able to anticipate any reduction in the needs of the Armed Forces, there was no possibility of anysubstantial recovery in the position being brought about within a short time.Allocations to the home front and to the occupied countries were at levels thenconsidered to be the essential minimum, and the Armed Forces were alreadyfeeling the severe shortage.At the beginning of, 1943 the Germans were consequently confronted withthe task of having to increase production and to reduce non-operationalconsumption still further. In addition, special reserves had to be set up on thefronts threatened by invasion. How far they succeeded in attaining the objectives is discussed below. Such adjustments as were achieved- during thepast year were, however, nullified by the Russian offensives which forced militaryconsumption to levels which made any accumulation of stocks impossible.A ttempts to increase Production.The attempts that have been made to increase production have not resultedin sufficient additions to supplies to alleviate the serious shortage. Details ofthe production from the different sources are given in Annex II and in theAppendix.In regard to synthetic oil, the progress of the construction of the new plantshas been slow and the additional output gained during the year has not amountedto more than 600,000 tons. To what extent this increase has been offset by the direct and indirect effect of air attacks is not known, although the deduction for1948 of 275,000 tons from the total output capacity of the synthetic oil industryto cover this factor may well be a low estimate.In the case of crude oil, the rapid exploitation of the new fields in the ViennaBasin has offset the decline in production from other countries, and the total output of mineral oil in 1943 was maintained at the same level as 1942. -Redxictions in Non-Military Consumption.Not withstanding the fact that in 1942 non-military consumption in Germanyand the occupied countries was reduced to figures which at that time must havebeen considered to be the lowest practical levels, there have since been furthercurtailments in civilian supplies.   (See Annex III.)   These reductions have not
been materially offset by an increased use of producer gas or substitute fuels asthe savings that have been made by these means have been relatively small, andthe scope for further savings is limited.   (See Annex IV.)The lack of liquid fuels and lubricants for transport and industry havenow become a major factor in the economic decay of enemy Europe. It is clearthat these further reductions in allocations would not have been made unless eitherthere was either an actual lack of oil to meet these requirements or military necessity caused these supplies to be earmarked for strategic purposes..The Establishment of Strategic Reserves.For some time the Germans have been establishing strategic stocks in thecountries threatened by invasion. An approximation - of the extent of thesereserves is. given in Annex V.These military reserves have been supplied partly by transfers from stockswithin Germany and partly by the drastic reduction in non-operational consump-tion. As the greater part of these reserves are in military dumps or are ear-marked for consumption by the defence forces, they virtually represent additions to tied stocks, and as such they reduce rather than increase the resilience of theGerman oil economy.Stocks at the end of 1948.The statistics detailed in Annex I, which closely agree with the findings ofthe United States Enemy Oil Committee, show that consumption exceeded procluc-tion in 1943, and that stocks had declined some 300,000 *tons below the level atwhich they stood at the end of 1942.Whereas our estimates for output are likely to be within a reasonable margin of error,&apos;it is possible that consumption in certain categories has been at higherlevels than has been estimated. No claim is, therefore, made for the absoluteaccuracy of our statistics. They are, however, based upon detailed examinationof a large volume of information and it is clear from intelligence that thesefigures correctly portray the trend during 1943. Heavy military demands have prevented any strengthening of the position, and at the end of the year Germany&apos;soil economy was in an extremely brittle condition.The Present Position.A tentative balance sheet in Annex I has been prepared for the purpose ofillustrating the production and consumption trend at the time of writing thisreport. The figures make allowance for some loss of output from Roumania*in May and June (the effect of the air attacks upon Roumania in April andMay have not yet been assessed), and it is also assumed, pending damagereports, that the attack on certain synthetic oil plants on the 12th Mayreduced the output of synthetic oil by 85,000 tons in both May and June. Armyconsumption has been calculated, on the hypothesis that military operations willcontinue at the same relatively low degree of activity as pertained during april and early May. These figures serve to show that production during theearly months of the year has slightly exceeded consumption with the result thatthe trend during this period has been toward some recovery of the depleted stock position.The attacks upon production sources in April and May have caused , a reversal of this trend and the tentative balance sheet for June shows a deficit in that month of 65,000 tons, even if these attacks are not renewed.Evidence of Strain.We must emphasise that these figures do not reflect the tension under whichthe.enemy&apos;s oil organisation is operating. For over two years supplies of liquidfuels and lubricants have been on no more than a hand-to-mouth basis and various factors are now coming into play that are contributing towards an overallweakening in the distribution, system. The gradual slowing up of deliveries,the losses caused by black markets and by sabotage, and the emergency con-sumption of supplies following air attacks are all factors which play their partin adding to supply difficulties.* It has been estimated, pending further information, that as a result of air attacks?,Roumanian production had declined 50% below the average production for the first four monthsof 1944.      &apos; -
Intelligence reports make clear the gravity of the situation. A capturedGerman army order gives proof of the difficulties of regrouping military unitson account of the need to save fuel. Numerous reports are being received of theeconomic difficulties that are arising from the lack of oil for essential purposes and afford evidence of the growing paralysis of the economy of Axis Europe.While Germany has so far succeeded in maintaining supplies to her forcesin the battle areas, the outlook is bleak indeed. The imminent possibility of theloss of the oil resources of Eoumania, Poland and Estonia, and the threat offurther damage to the synthetic oil plants leaves Germany with the alternative of either weakening her present war potential by making further reduction in consumption for the purpose of building up stocks, or of risking a disastrousbreakdown through lack of reserves.Furthermore, with the expectation of having to increase greatly the use of road transport on account of damage to rail communications, there will be additional demands for supplies and for the establishment of dispersed reserves.The Future Trend.The effect of different circumstances upon the future trend is illustrated ina chart upon page . From this it will be seen that a general Allied offensive on broad fronts, combined with reductions in production through Allied attacks,would have far-reaching effects on Germany&apos;s power of resistance. the deficiencies that may occur, the consequent results, and the possibility of Germanybeing able to offset these adverse conditions, are summarised in the following-paragraphs.The Effect of Increased Military A ctivity.Assuming that the present relatively low rate of military activity shouldcontinue to the end of June, and that production is not reduced further by air attack in the interval, then total Axis consumption during June is estimatedat 1,220,000 tons as against a production of 1,155,000 tons, representing a deficit of 65,000 tons.  (See balance sheet in Annex I.)As any further important cuts in civilian consumption would have resultsas serious for the German war effort as reductions in military supplies, we have assumed, for the purpose of argument, that allocations to industry and transport will remain substantially at present levels. A general offensive from the Eastand an invasion from the West would result in army consumption increasingabove present levels by from 75,000 to 150,000 tons per month. It is to be expectedthat there would also be a sharp increase in naval and air fore,   consumption,such increase being possibly followed by a rapid decline on account of losses in battle. In these circumstances the total increase in consumption by all theservices during the first month of a general Allied offensive might be to the orderof 150,000 tons per month and thereafter continue for at least a time at this level, the possible declines in naval and air consumption being offset by the growing intensity of land battles. In these circumstances, and with production at the rate of 1,155,000 tons per month, Germany would be faced with a deficit of 215,000 tons per month.The Effect of the Loss of Production.The foregoing statistics have not taken into account the effect of the possibleloss of important sources of supply. The probable consequences of the oil pro-duction of Eoumania, Poland, Estonia and Hungary becoming totally denied toGermany are detailed in Annex VI. The loss of the first three of these countries would mean a net loss to Germany of 100,000 tons of oil a month. With no increase in the present level of military activity this would mean a monthly deficit of 165,000 tons. If fighting develops to the extent postulated in the preceding paragraph, this deficit would become 315,000 tons, which would be equal to a deficiency of 22 per cent, of requirements. (These figures are based on theassumption that Roumania&apos;s output -is at present reduced by 50 per cent, asa result of bomb damage. If output should become restored, the net loss toGermany from the three countries would be 260,000 tons. At the present levelof military activity this would mean a monthly deficit of 325,000 tons. At ahigh level of activity this figure would become 475,000 tons, equal to a deficiency of 35 per cent.)
German Inability to Increase Production.As shown in Annex VI, the loss of these countries would be a more seriousblow than the statistics indicate. Germany relies upon these countries for about25 per cent, of her motor fuel requirements and also for important quantities ofspecial products, including aviation fuel blending stocks, lubricants, fuel oils and special naphthas.The possible steps open to Germany to remedy these losses are outlined in annex VII. This Annex shows that, even on a relatively long-term programme,Germany cannot offset the loss of the oil resources of Eastern Europe by increasingproduction elsewhere.The Hungarian oilfields are potentially capable of a large increase in production. We have assumed that, if the German exploitation of these resourcesproves to be successful, output may increase by half a million tons a year. Ifthis increase begins to take effect during the second half of 1944, it is likely tobe counterbalanced by a sharp decline in the production of Austria. We have estimated that the output of the Vienna Basin may have increased to a rate of2,000,000 tons by the end of June, and then declining to a rate of 1,500,000 tons bythe end of the year.Effect of Oil Shortage on Military A ctivity.The tabulation at the end of this Annex shows that Germany would be facedwith a serious deficiency in all products with the possible exception of lubricantbase stock. The cutting of consumption to meet this deficit would have to fallprincipally upon the armed forces. Such cuts would inevitably affect military activity, both directly and indirectly.If the loss of Roumania, Poland and Estonia should approximately coincide with a general Allied offensive on broad fronts, Germany would be iaced with her consumption requirements being over 50 per cent, in excess of total produc-tion. The only cushion of stocks available to meet this deficit are those suppliesthat have been accumulated by the armed forces as emergency reserves. Theprobable extent of these reserves is discussed in Annex V. If cut off from other sources of supply, it is pointed out that these reserves are likely to be sufficientto maintain from one to two months&apos; active fighting.The question then arises as to how soon serious operational shortages arelikely to occur. This would naturally depend upon the rate of local consumption,the amount of local reserves, and the extent to which oil supplies could be deflectedto vital points. While it is impossible to give a definite answer to this question,it is considered that in view of the shortages of particular products (especiallymotor spirit) that would arise, it is highly probable that operational requirementscould not be met within two to three months of these events occurring.Weak Points in the German Oil Position.In all our previous Reports we have made clear the vital dependence ofGermany upon her principal sources of oil production. We have also stronglyemphasised the strain under which the enemy&apos;s oil industry was operating andthe consequent sensitiveness of the distribution system to dislocation. Theposition is now more vulnerable than at any previous time.Upon the loss of Roumania, Poland and Estonia, Germany would becomedependent on the synthetic industry for about 55 per cent, of her total supplies.Likewise the dislocation of a certain proportion of the available petroleumrefining capacity would have far-reaching repercussions. A study of the relative importance of the European refineries is attached in Annex VIII.Particular reference is made to the shortage of capacity for the productionof high-grade lubricants. . Destruction of from two to font; of the specialisedplants engaged in their manufacture would slow down the German war machine.Signed on behalf,of the Sub-Committee :H. HARTLEY, Chairman,
The Statistical Position.As a result of our previous detailed studies of the Axis Europe oil positionit was agreed that stocks at the beginning of 1943 were then at such a level that further withdrawals to make up any material deficit between current supply and consumption were no longer possible. An estimate of the extent of these stockscannot be satisfactorily calculated, although it is considered that since theycomprise oil in process and in distribution, the extent to which a proportion ofthem might be potentially consumable at the expense of subsequent shortage wouldbe very limited. In conjunction with the United States Enemy Oil Committee itwas agreed that the nominal figure of 4,000,000 tons should be taken as a datumlevel as at the beginning of 1943. An analysis of the stock position is given in annex V.Balance Sheet, 1943.\ &apos;  Metric Tons.Stocks at nominal datum level at 1st January, 1943 ...       ...       ...       ...      4,000,000Production (see Annex II and Appendix, Table T)-(i) Crude and Shale Oils    ...       ...   -   ..(ii) Synthetic Oils(iii) Substitutes and Miscellaneous ...Consumption (see Annex III) (i) Armed Forces t (a) Armies        ...      ...(b) Naval ...      ... r(c) Air Force    ...       ...       ...(d) Todt.........

However, an addition of 50,000 tons has been made to coverproduction from the Meldorf area which, from aerial reconnaissance, appearslikely to have about the same output as the Heide field. An allowance of 2,000 tons per annum has been made for the production of natural gasoline from certainfields. The production trend for Germany is likely to be level, if not slightlydeclining.Austria.Production for the first six months of 1944 is estimated at the annual rateof just over 2 million tons. The production during this period, compared with1943, in the various fields is estimated as follows : 1st Siw Months, 1944-1943. Annual Rate.Zistersdorf    ...       ...       ...         63,000 60,000Gaiselberg    ...       ...       ...        360.000 360,000Kreuzfeld     .........         65,000 165,000Prinzendorf/St. Ulrich     ...        750,000 1,440,000[27474] &apos; c
Air cover in February 1944 shows no important changes in the Zistersdorffield, but important developments have taken place in the Prinzendorf area.Eighty-eight new locations have been detected, making the total number nearly200, including drilling wells. The increase has been at the rate of 15 per month,although a number of the wells appear to be dry holes.New locations are largely devoted to filling in the area already proved andthere have apparently been no major extensions towards the south or north.Production in the Prinzendorf field during the last half of 1944 is expectedto fall to the annual rate of 1 million tons.Czechoslovakia.Air cover of the Gbely field, obtained recently for the first time, is not complete, but a closely drilled area is seen one mile west of the field, and there arescattered wells a half to two miles south-west of the village. There is no indica-tion of recent developments. Unless developments have taken place in the areafurther north, it must be assumed that the normal decline in production willnot have been offset by recent discoveries. We have, therefore, allowed a declinefactor of about 10 per cent, and thus reduced otir estimates from 32,000 tons for1943 to 30,000 for the current year.Poland.Recent reports indicate that the decline in the Polish fields has been haltedand that crude production may now be somewhat higher than was reported lastyear. Production has been estimated at 400,000 tons, which includes about40,000 tons of natural gasoline.France.Included in our current estimate is 15,000 tons for crude production from the st. Gaudens fields. It is evident that there is a certain amount of active drillingin this area, but it is considered that no substantial production of crude has yetbeen secured from this area. The details of a contract between the Kontinental,01 A.G. and French interests have been received which indicate that in returnfor certain drilling facilities, the Germans have secured a substantial interest in .the resultant production. It may be expected that this area will be exploitedas rapidly as conditions permit.Hungary.Prior to the assumption by Germany of greater control in Hungary,production had been restricted to a rate of 800,000 tons per annum. The fieldsin the Lispe area are capable of an appreciably increased output, although itis not known how many months wTould elapse before this increase could beachieved. It has consequently been assumed that, as a result of the steps takenby the Germans, the oil production of Hungary is now at the level of about one million tons.Yugoslavia.Production is estimated at the former level of 50,000 tons. There is, however,some evidence that larger production is now being secured from the Gojilo area and it is possible that the output of oil in Yugoslavia may be slightly increasing.Roumania.Our estimate of 5,450,000 tons, including 200,000 tons of natural gasoline,for 1943 assumed that the production level was the same as that obtaining in1942. It was considered that production derived from marginal&apos; wells and frominterspacing was sufficient to offset the normal decline in the various fields, andthat some production, although probably on a small scale, had been secured from new areas.The present rate of production in Roumania is not known. The trend isbelieved to be declining and it is estimated that production for the first four months of 1944 was at the rate of 4,905,000 tons (including 180,000 tons of natural gasoline), or 10 per cent, lower than the rate for 1943. To allow for the dislocation caused by air attacks up to the 12th May, it has been assumed that production during May and June will drop by 50 per cent. The rate of output for the first six months of 1944 is consequently estimated at,090,000 tons, which includes 150,000 tons of natural gasoline.i!1
Synthetic Oil Production.The estimated current capacities of the various plants are detailed in annex II. The figures are based as far as possible upon aerial photographs.A deduction has been made equivalent to one month&apos;s capacity of the five plantswhich were attacked on the 12th May. There has also been deducted the equivalent of 5 per cent, of capacity to cover adverse factors due to war-time conditions.The allowance of 230,000 tons per annum made in the November Report forunknown plants has been increased to 300,000 tons per annum.The following information is disclosed by the latest aerial reconnaissancesup to the time of the attacks on the 12th May : Bergius Hydrogenation Plants.Blechhammer North.Preliminary study of recent air cover shows that six of the eight stalls arevacant, and only one of the other two can definitely be said to contain high-pressure vessels. From this and from the fact that only a small portion of the refinery appears to be in operation, it can be deduced that oil production is at only a small fraction of the plant&apos;s planned capacity.Blechhammer South.As there has been no apparent increase in the number of hydrogenation stallsin operation during the last six months, production is estimated to be still at thesame rate as it was in November 1943.Bohlen Rotha.No additions of plants have been made at the old works: there is,consequently, no reason to modify existing production estimates. The new sectionincludes oil storage, additional distillation plant and a possible high-pressure gassynthesis plant. We have no knowledge of any data on which the probable outputof this plant can be deduced.Bruoc.At least ten, and probably eleven, of the twelve stalls of the first stage of construction are completed and in use. At a rate of production on brown coal tarof 62,500 tons per annum per stall, total production over the period will havebeen at a rate of 700,000 tons per annum. None of the six new stalls can beexpected to come into operation before July at the earliest.Gelsenkirchen-Nordstern.There is now little sign of damage from the November attacks except that thelargest gas holder is badly damaged. A high degree of activity is apparent. Thestalls have been fitted with covers of heavy construction evidently intended toprevent bombs exploding in the stalls. No special protection of any other partsof the plant can be observed.Leuna.The boiler houses, injector house, stalls, refinery and various other parts ofthe plant were active in March. Four new isolated stalls have been equipped and may be in use. Almost the whole southern sector of the works is complete andin operation.Lutzkendorf-Mucheln.There is abundant evidence of a high level of activity over the whole plant,including the catalyst plant. Steam emission from the end of the second contactoven house and from the cooling towers serving this house confirms the belief that both are in action.Magdeburg.The plant appears fully active. Vessels have been installed in the southstall, but no connections appear to have been made in the upper part. This stallmay come into use in the near future.[27474] c 2
Poelitz.The plant shows a high level of activity. Construction of a new gasholderis proceeding slowly; a sixth carbonising oven has been completed and is in use.The ninth pair of stalls is still not equipped, though a start may have been made.Scholven-Buer.The works show a high degree of activity and the fourth and fifth pairs ofstalls in the new plant are apparently in use. One new stall in the &quot;old&quot;section and two new pairs in the &quot; new &quot; section may well be in use. The ratedcapacity is, therefore, estimated at 375,000 tons, compared with the previousfigure of 350,000 tons per annum.Troglitz-Zeitz.The plant appears generally active. One cell of each of the originaladditional pairs of stalls is being equipped; the set of quadruple stalls apparentlyremains empty.Welheim Bottrop.There was no major change in the plant during 1943. In April 1944 theworks were damaged and largely closed down. One half of the boiler-house was wrecked and the lights blown out of the generator hall. The other halfof the boiler-house remains in use. The current estimate has, therefore, beenreduced from 100,000 tons to the rate of 75,000 tons per annum.Wesseling.Air cover prior to December indicated a low degree of operation, * butphotographs taken during that month showed increased activity. Reconnaissancescarried out this year now make it appear as though activity has again declined.The boiler-house, water-gas purification and synthetic plants have recently been active, but there is no direct evidence of the use of the hydrogenation sectionor of the refinery. Progress has been made in the construction of the new pairof stalls, but high pressure vessels have still to be installed.A uschwitz.The hydrogenation section at the new plant at Auschwitz is only just cominginto use. When the construction now in progress has been completed the outputof this plant may be at the rate of 180,000 tons per annum. The plannedcapacity of the plant is probably to the order of half a million tons per annum.2. Fischer Tropsch Plants.Dortmund.The plant was bombed last May and not all the damage has yet been repaired.The end of the contact oven house has not yet been restored and four of the seventy-two ovens are not in position. Apart from this, the rest of the plant is active and has presumably operated fully on the ovens in position, but output mayhave been reduced by 5 per cent, over the last ten months.Holt en Sterkrade.All the bomb damage caused early in 1943 has been cleared away or repaired.The damage to oil storage and a cooling tower under construction is not likelyto reduce output and the works are very active.Construction in the new section has continued steadily. Among the new plant are four stout columns which might be Cowper Stoves, and suggest a HighPressure Fischer Tropsch plant.Homberg.The bomb damage has been repaired and the works show a high level of activity. No extensions have been made to the synthetic sections, but new construction can be seen on the south-east part of the site. The purpose of thisis not as yet evident.Kamen-Dortmund.The plant is fully active. The extension to the water-gas plant does not seemto have been brought into use.
Wanne Eickel.Activity is general, but little progress has been made with extensions.Tar Oils.High Temperature Tars.Assuming that the German coke ovens were working to normal peacetimecapacity, the quantity of coal carbonised would be 85 per cent, of the estimatedannual rated capacity of 74-3 million tons, i.e., 63-2 million tons with the cokeyield (at 75 per cent.) about 47-4 million tons. Allowing for adverse war-timefactors to the extent of 15 per cent, and 3 per cent, per annum on the ratedcapacities, according to the areas in which the ovens are situated, the amount of hard coke actually produced works out to 40 million tons. On this basis theproduction of high temperature tar oils in Greater Germany is estimated at-31 million tons. Production in the occupied countries is put at 1-34 million tons. About half a million tons is considered to be used as raw material for the synthetic oil plants.   Thus there is available for distillation 3,150,000 tons.Low Temperature Tars.No new information has been received to indicate that the figures previouslytaken for L.T. tars from bituminous and brown coals require amendment. Thefigures of 200,000 and 500,000 tons for these items (shown in the November Report;)are maintained.Substitute Fuels.Benzol.In the November Report the quantity of benzol available for motor fuelpurposes was estimated at 600,000 tons per annum. Output is now at a lower rate.The current production in Germany of crude benzol is estimated at 554,000 tonsand 63,000 tons from coke ovens and gas works respectively; the production in the occupied countries is estimated at about 300,000 tons. Half of this total production of 900,000 tons is considered to be required for purposes other thanautomotive fuel. The benzol contribution to the liquid fuel position is thereforeestimated at 450,000 tons.Ethandl.Our estimate of ethanol consumption has been reduced from the previousfigure of 115,000 tons to 100,000 tons per annum. Approximately 50,000 tons are used to blend with motor spirit in the occupied countries, chiefly in hungary and France; in the latter country alcohol is used to the extent of 29 per cent, of themixture of motor spirit, benzol and alcohol. There is still no evidence that alcoholis blended with motor spirit in Germany, but we have allowed a figure of 50,000tons to cover any small quantity which may be used for this purpose.Vegetable Oils.The maximum amount of vegetable oils available is thought not to exceed50,000 tons per annum. As a substantial quantity is required for other purposes,the amount used as lubricants will probably not exceed 25,000 tons per annum.Lubricating Oil Regenerated.The estimate of 200,000 tons is not supported by definite evidence, but theamount of oil regenerated is probably slightly less than in former years. Theprevious figure of 240,000 tons has therefore been reduced to 200,000 tons, whichis in agreement with the estimate of the United States Enemy Oil Committee.

An Estimate of Consumption by Civilian and Industrial Users, 1st january to 30th June, 1944.The estimated oil consumption by non-military users during the first sixmonths of 1944 is detailed in Table Ib at the end of this annex.1. Greater Germany.Table Ic shows the detailed figures for the annual rates of consumption bycivilian and industrial users in Greater Germany for the period under review.(a) Motor Cycles.We share the view of the United States Enemy Oil Committee that thenumber of motor cycles operating is now reduced. Our estimate is based on theassumption that there has been a reduction of about 25 per cent, compared withthe 1943 figure of 800,000 and that each cycle is consuming - 075 of a ton perannum.(b) Private Cars.It is estimated that 200,000 private cars are operating, 147,000 on petrol and53,000 on bottled gas. At an average annual consumption of one ton per car,the petrol consumption is equivalent to 147,000 tons per annum. Assuming theconsumption of bottled gas is at the rate of 1-15 tons per car, the total bottledgas consumption is 61,000 tons per annum.(c) Omnibuses.No change has been made in our previous estimate of consumption byomnibuses, of which 2,000 are assumed to be running on town gas and 12,000on Diesel oil. The total liquid fuel consumption is estimated at 168,000 tons per annum.(d) Trucks.Our estimates are based on the assumption that each of the 18,000 trucks isConsuming 3 tons of petrol per annum, 38,&apos;O0O are operating on Diesel oil, eachconsuming 9 tons per annum, and 60,000 are using bottled gas at the rate of 3 tons per annum. In addition, 10,000 trucks are working on high-pressure town gas.Thus there are 126,000 trucks in service, excluding the 25,000 Diesel trucks whichhave been converted to producer gas, and which consume both producer gas andalso Diesel oil to the extent of 3 tons per annum.These figures include the trucks operated by N.S.K.K. and OrganisationTodt. The probable consumption by the latter may well be more than has been estimated. In view of the continued high level of activity upon fortifications,essential repair reconstruction and other projects, the amount of fuel being-Consumed in the transport of material to these undertakings may be considerable,and this notwithstanding the extensive use of producer gas-driven units. Theamount of fuel consumed in stationary and semi-stationary equipment by theOrganisation Todt is put at 320,000 tons, and is shown under consumption bythe Armed Forces.(e) Railways.We have adopted the United States Enemy Oil Committee&apos;s estimate of20,000 tons per annum for consumption of bottled gas, and have assumed thatthe consumption of gas oil is about one-third of the 1938 rate, viz., 22,000 tons.(f) Inland Shipping.Included in the estimate for inland shipping is the consumption by transport on the Danube, fuel oil 216,000 tons, gas oil 12,000 tons and lubricants 5,000 tons per annum. The estimates for the civil consumption of Roumania includeallowances for consumption at Danube ports and for coastwise traffic, but not for other movements on the Danube.(g) Bunkers.Our estimates for 1943 were reduced to the low figure of 5,000 tons per month   It is believed that consumption continues at about the same level.
(h) Commercial Aviation.The estimate of 24,000 tons per annum covers commercial aviation require-ments for the whole of Axis Europe. German commercial aviation requirements have been reported to be at the rate of 12,000 tons per annum. The figure of24,000 tons for the whole of Europe can, therefore, be regarded as a maximum.(i) A griculture.In our November Report it was assumed that of the 110,000 tractors, 40,000were operating on producer gas and 70,000 on liquid fuels. It is now thoughtthat the number operating on liquid fuels has been reduced to 65,000, whoseconsumption at the rate of 2^ tons per annum is equivalent to 156,000 tons. no allowance has been made under this heading for liquid fuel consumption by other agricultural machinery as it is thought that such machinery has by now been converted to operate on other fuels. We share, however, the view of the UnitedStates Enemy Oil Committee that some allowance should have been made in our previous estimates to cover this machinery as the conversions have probably only recently been completed.(j) Industry.Our estimates include 30,000 tons of gasoline, and 4,800 tons of lubricants,for aero-engine testing, compared with our previous estimate of 36,000 tons ofgasoline, as it is assumed that aero-engine production is now on a reduced scale.An allowance has been included for the consumption of technical gasolinesto the extent of 240,000 tons per annum. Under the kerosine heading we havealso allowed for 96,000 tons of liquid fuels which have been despatched toMoosbierbaum, possibly for hydroforming for toluol.(k) Kerosine.The estimate for kerosine for household use remains at the level of our previous estimate, namely, 96,000 tons per annum.2 and 3. Czechoslovakia, Poland and Danzig.Current consumption in these countries is estimated at approximately thesame percentage of pre-war consumption as in Germany, namely, about 38 per cent.4. Finland.It is thought that there has been no recent change in the consumption level.5. Norway.Our estimates are in accordance with recent intelligence and show thatconsumption has fallen by about 20 per cent, during recent months, the reductionbeing largely in respect of motor fuels.6, 7 and 8. Denmark, Belgium and Holland.Small reductions have been allowed for in each of these countries. no official figures have been received recently but the trend of evidence is that alloca-tions in these countries are now on a very meagre scale, particularly with regardto motor fuel.9. France.Our present estimates show a 10 per cent, reduction on those for 1943, inrespect of which we received figures from a reliable source. The motor fuel and gas oil consumption is based on recent information. The former includes alcoholand benzol, which is blended with the petrol to the extent of 29 per cent, and13 per cent, respectively.10. Hungary.It is believed that the German control of Hungary has not so far caused any reduction in internal consumption, which remains at a high percentage of pre-war consumption. The figure for kerosine is put at 68,000 tons, compared withour previous estimate of 48,000, in view of the recent report that allocations haverecently been increased by 40 per cent.
[27474]A token figure of 50,000 tons has been assumed to cover the present consump-tion in the parts of Italy now occupied by the Germans. Nothing has been included for civilian consumption in Albania, as it is assumed that what littlefuel is available is derived from local production.12. Roumania.During at least the first few months of this year the internal consumptionof Roumania continued at high levels. However, owing to (a) the loss of partsof Transnistria, (b) some replacement of fuel oil by natural gas, and (c) recentdislocations on account of air attacks, it has been assumed that consumptionduring the six months will have decreased by 10 per cent.13 to 18. The Balkans and Baltic States.There is no special item in these estimates which calls for comment. Theconsumption in each of these countries continues to be on a very low scale.

Conversions to Substitute Fuels.The attached table is an approximation of the number of operative non-military motor vehicles in Axis Europe in March 1944. This table indicates ourestimate of the extent of conversions to substitute fuels.In our November Report the broad conclusions were reached that all thereadily convertible commercial vehicles and a considerable number of passengercars had already been converted, that a limitation in the supplies of the variousgases used as substitute fuels precluded any great increase in conversions to thesefuels, and that further conversion to any substitute fuel on any appreciable scalewas unlikely. Whereas there is scope for the further conversion of passengervehicles, the information available since the beginning of the year tends to confirm the general accuracy of these conclusions.We now estimate that out of a total of 400,000 commercial vehicles and200,000 passenger vehicles in Germany, 332,000 and 53,000 respectively have been converted to use substitute fuels; these figures represent 82 per cent, and 26 - 5 percent, of the total fleets and 64 per cent, of the combined motor vehicle strength ofGermany. * No statistics are available from Germany upon the actual extent ofthe conversion of passenger vehicles and our assessment of the position is basedlargely upon two pointers which support the view that the programme is losingmomentum and that no substantial additional conversion can be expected.German legislation on this subject has, in general, been a barometer of the planned extent of activity in this direction; in the last six months the only regula-tion issued appears to be designed to tie up the loose ends of the conversion schemeand indicates the official view that conversion in Germany has shot its bolt.Secondly, the general tenor of all press references to the use of substitute fuelssince November has been one of admission that the problems of fuel supply andmaintenance, created by the conversions already achieved, are becoming continuallymore difficult to solve.Other Countries.There is considerable scope for further conversions in Eastern Europe, butthe progress that has been made in converting vehicles has been slow and appearsunlikely to gain any momentum. In Western Europe, on the other hand, andespecially in Holland, Belgium, Norway and Denmark, saturation point hasvirtually been reached.Conclusions.Whereas there is still a considerable field for the more extensive use ofsubstitute fuels in Axis Europe, the increasing difficulties in the manufacture of units and in&quot; the supply of fuel are reducing the scope for further conversions.Replacement of obsolete producer gas units is largely absorbing the availableoutput of new units.* These figures are in some disagreement with &apos;,the statistics of the United States EnemyOil Committee. Our estimate of the number of vehicles operating on solid fuels is substantially higher than the Washington estimate. This is partly due to a basic difference in the estimates of the present number of vehicles in Germany and the subject is still being studied.Germany.

Note on the Stock Position ane- the Shortage of Reserves.0At the end of 1942 stocks were considered to be at the distributionalminimum. We defined the distributional minimum as the level at which furtherwithdrawals from stocks to make up any material deficit between current supplyand consumption were no longer possible.During 1943 the position has been changing in that substantial areas ofEurope have been lost to the Axis, military reserves have been established on the threatened fronts, and the distribution of oil for non-military purposes hasmarkedly decreased.Our statistics show that at the end of 1943 stocks were less by about300,000 tons than they were twelve months previously. Although there is no evidence of any serious breakdown in distribution at the end of the year,intelligence confirms that the position was extremely strained, and that theessential strategic stocks being established for meeting invasion were only beingaccumulated at the cost of reductions in supplies urgently needed for other purposes.The tentative balance-sheet for the first six months of this year shows that stocks have recovered to the extent of being back to the same level as at thebeginning of 1943; during June, however, the stock trend will once again bedeclining. As increased military activity will seriously worsen the position itis important to know what cushion of stocks, if any, there will be to fall backon before consumption has to be reduced to the same level as production.Oil that is in process and in transit is &quot; tied &quot; and, therefore, while in this state is not consumable. Consequently, consumable stocks might be considered as that amount of oil that is in distributional storage awaiting consumption.Such stocks might be divided into civilian, Navy, G.A.F. and Army : Civilian. It is certain that allocations of supplies for non-military purposes are on a hand-to-mouth basis and that there are no free civilian stocks of any sizeavailable to be drawn upon.Navy. The extent of naval stocks is not known. It might be expected thatfleet units would have a shore reserve equal to, say, two months&apos; consumption, or about 290,000 tons. Last year it was reported that the German navy wasembarrassed by the shortage of fuel and that stocks at that time were only200,000 tons. It would seem unlikely at the present time that stocks would bevery much above this figure.G.A .F. The operational reserve aimed at by the G.A.F. may be to the orderof three to four weeks&apos; consumption, or a total of about 250,000 tons. However,it appears probable from intelligence that reserves are lower than this figure.Armies. The strain imposed upon Germany&apos;s oil supplies by the prolongedduration of the Russian offensive last winter resulted in a critical depletion of stocks. Except for military reserves earmarked for other fronts, German armystocks must have been negligible at the beginning of this year. It is not knownto what extent reserves have since been put aside, although the followingtabulation gives some indication of the probable position : (1) Eastern Front (including Poland and Germany East of &apos; In metricthe River Elbe).

Reserves are known to have been built up in Western Europe, Norway and greece and intelligence suggests that these are to the order of two months&apos; con-sumption at fully active rates. The figures given for the other parts of German-occupied Europe are speculative and have been based upon general evidence ofthe state of the supply situation and of German military practice.In regard to the Eastern Front, it is probable that during and immediatelyafter the Russian winter offensive supplies were on a producer to consumerbasis and stocks in the rear areas depleted. Some accrual of supplies must have since been made and the estimate given is considered reasonable.The stocks shown in each of these areas could only be transferred from onetheatre of operations to another to a very limited extent and consequently theymust to a large extent be regarded as &quot; tied &quot; in the areas where they are situated.The size of the military reserves existing in Germany west of the Elbe isnot known. By deduction, and in view of the general position, it is unlikely thatthese stocks exceed the figures given above. The estimate of 150,000 to 200,000 tons is equivalent to about the minimum to which these stocks would be allowed to fallexcept under urgent stress.Conclusions.1. Excluding military strategic reserves, present stocks are at not morethan the distributional minimum.2. Reserves held by the armed forces are likely to be sufficient, if cut off from other sources of supply, to maintain from one to two months&apos; active fighting.3. The periods within which an operational oil shortage is likely to develop,in the event of a decline in production and/or simultaneous offensives on theEastern and Western fronts, would be largely governed by local supply difficulties.(a) In Western Europe this period is likely to be at least two months.   Ifrail communications are virtually severed this period might beshortened to six weeks.(b) On the Eastern Front, supplies to the Northern and Central sectors can probably be maintained indefinitely so long as the synthetic oil plants in Northern and Eastern Germany continue to function.In regard to the Southern sector, if (i) Oil refining in Roumania is brought to a complete standstill,(ii) Rail communications through Hungary are seriously inter -rupted, an operational shortage may well develop after one month.ANNEX VI.Effect of the Loss of the Oil Resources of Roumania, Poland and Estonia.Germany is now faced with the imminent threat of * the loss of the oil supplies of these three countries. The probable effect of this loss is outlinedbelow.Statistical Effect of the Loss.Roumanian, Polish and Estonian production is currently estimated to beat the rate of 2,812,000 tons of finished products per annum. The civilconsumption of these countries is estimated at 1,660,000 tons. If, therefore,Germany loses these sources of supply she would suffer a net loss of approximately100,000 tons per month. (If the production of Hungary were also denied, therewould be an additional loss of approximately 660,000 tons a year, or 55,000 tonsa month.)The loss of supplies from these three countries would consequently add toGe.germany&apos;s present monthly deficit of 65,000 tons (see Balance Sheet in Annex I),making a total deficit of 165,000 tons. As pointed out elsewhere in this Report,this deficit is calculated on the assumption that military activity would be at the comparatively low level of April when no major offensives were taking place.Deficiencies arising from the Loss.These countries have been providing Germany with approximately 20 percent, of her motor fuel requirements and also substantial quantities of dieseland fuel oils. Roumania has not only been producing an important proportionof the G.A.F.&apos;s requirements for aviation fuel but, in addition, she has beenT27474] x
responsible for supplying large quantities of lubricating oil base stocks. Ofscarcely less importance are Roumania&apos;s shipments of diesel oils and specialboiling point spirits for the chemical industry.Germany would endeavour to make up for the loss of special qualityproducts by -adjustments in her refining programmes. Although it might bepossible to remedy quality deficiencies in due time this would not make up forquantity deficiencies. Furthermore, the loss of Roumania&apos;s important crackingcapacity would reduce to an important extent the flexibility of the oil industryremaining to the enemy. Germany is deficient in cracking capacity and inconsequence the gasoline off take from the available crudes would be substantially below requirements.Consequent Dislocation of Distribution.Quite apart from the effect of the loss of this oil upon the German supply position, there would have to be drastic alterations in the organisation of distribution. The stoppage of supplies from the east would not only mean areorientation of the movements from the remaining sources available to Germanybut it would also involve additional burdens on the transport system.A most serious implication of the loss of these sources of supply would bethe extent to which Germany would become dependent upon her syntheticproduction. If bereft of the production of these three countries, no less than56 per cent, of the remaining supplies would have to come from the synthetic oil plants. __ANNEX VII.German Inability to Increase Production.Even on a relatively long-term programme, Germany cannot offset the loss ofthe oil resources in Eastern Europe by increasing production elsewhere. Thefollowing notes indicate what possibilities Germany has of being able to augmentthe present output of oil from indigenous sources : Hydrogenation Plants.The completion of Brtix, Blechhammer North and South, and Auschwitz,together with the additions that have been planned to other hydrogenation plants,would add materially to synthetic oil production. In spite of the high prioritygiven to these developments, the progress of construction has not only been slow,but is decelerating, and no important short-term increase in production can beexpected from these plants.The conversion of the nitrogen fixation equipment at Leuna would result inadditional liquid fuel capacity of about 400,000 tons per annum. This changemight be made within about six months if it had been anticipated, but it wouldtake at least a year if not prepared for in advance.Fischer Tropsch Synthesis.It is not possible substantially to increase the present production of existingplants except at locations where nitrogen fixation plant exists. At HoltenSterkrade, and possibly at certain other plants, it would be possible to supplyhydrogen from nitrogen fixation equipment. Although the change could be madequickly, it is doubtful whether the increased production would be more than smallfigures.Low-Temperature Tar. IThe present output of liquid fuels from low-temperature tar in Germany isestimated at 5/600,000 tons per annum, of which about 20 per cent, is derivedfrom bituminous coal. An increase in low-temperature tar production would necessitate the mining of substantial additional quantities of brown coal; forexample, to produce a half-million tons of low-temperature tar about 7 million tons of brown coal would be required.The tar could be used as fuel, but it provides practically no light productsby direct distillation, and even after removal of tar acids (minimum 10 per cent.)would give only 38 per cent, of 50 Cetene Gas/Diesel oil, or some 170,000 tons, and32 per cent, fuel oil, or 140,000 tons.High-Temperature Tars.No important increase in coke oven capacity is likely in present circum-stances. There is the possibility that a greater use could be made of high-temperature pitch in proportion to the mineral oil residues which have been
hitherto supplied to certain of the hydrogenation plants; the additional produc-tion gained would, however, be relatively small.Substitutes.The use of low-pressure gases is likely to have approached saturation-point.It is possible that methanol and more ethanol could be employed for liquid fuelpurposes, but, in view of other essential requirements for these products, their use on an extensive scale is unlikely.Crude Oil.There is scope for increases in the production of crude oil in certain areas,although such increases are likely to be offset by declining production in other areas.The country where production is most capable of being increased is Hungary.On the other hand, production in the Austrian fields, which is estimated to haveincreased to the rate of 2 million per annum for the first half of 1944, is expectedto decline to an annual rate of 1^ million tons for the second half of the year.In the case of Hungary, production has been running during 1943 at theannual rate of 800,000 tons and, on the assumption that the Germans have already taken steps to increase output, the present level of production is estimated at million tons. It is not known to what extent production from existing wellscan be increased, or whether extensive drilling will be necessary before importantadditions to output can be made. Assuming that it might be possible for pro-duction to be further increased by 500,000 tons during the next six months, whichwould be a maximum estimate, this would only offset the anticipated decline in theAustrian fields.The approximate quantities of primary finished products that would result from this additional Hungarian oil and a decline of \ million tons per annum inthe Austrian fields, are shown in the Table below. In this Table there is alsoshown an estimate of the reductions in the current (May/June) quantities of finished Products available to Germany which would result from the total lossof Roumania, Poland and Estonia.

The breakdown of this quantity is (tons per annum):Motor Fuel, 657,000; Kerosine, 324,000; Gas/Diesel, 292,000; Lubricants, 50,000; and Fuel Oil,987,000.Conclusions.1. Even on a relatively long-term programme, Germany cannot offset theloss of the oil resources of Eastern Europe by increasing production elsewhere.2. No important short-term increase in production can be expected from the synthetic oil plants.  Crude oil production is more likely to decline than increase.3. Upon the loss of these countries German supplies of motor fuel would be short to the extent of over 1 million tons per annum, or 26 per cent, of the presentarmy consumption.4. The loss of Roumanian oil would have a serious effect on supplies of aviation fuel.[27474-] - e 2
The Mineral Olx Refining Capacity of Axis Europe, April 1944.Memorandum by the European Axis Oil Production Committee.The probable effect of destruction of oil refining capacity in the variousareas of German Europe is discussed in the following paper prepared by the axis Oil Production Committee, to whom the report of the United States EnemyOil Committee (J.I.C. 106/2) was referred by the War Cabinet TechnicalSub-Committee on Axis Oil.The United States Enemy Oil Committee, in their tentative estimates inMarch, showed the useful refining capacity remaining at the disposal of theWestern Axis at 11,825,000 tons per year and the quantity of crude production at 8,342,000 tons per year.A parallel study by the Ministry of Econcmic Warfare, allowing for furtherrepairs to the Roumanian refineries, put the figures somewhat higher, namely,a useful refining capacity of 13,378,000 tons per year, against an estimatedproduction of over 9 million tons of crude oil, leaving a margin of refiningcapacity of about 4 million tons per year.All these figures are based on an evaluation of the destruction or damage toknown refineries up to the end of April, and an allowance made for those whichare considered to be of no practical value to the Axis mainly for geographicalreasons, such as the bulk of the French and Italian refineries.The capacity of the individual refineries is, in turn, based on pre-warinformation (not always very complete), and what little is known of any subsequent extensions and modifications. Some new refineries are known to havebeen built and certain equipment has been removed from some French refineriesto unknown destinations.With so many unknown factors* involved, it is felt that a global arithmeticapproach to the problem is insufficient, particularly as minor errors in estimatingeither refining capacity or production would have a much bigger effect on thecalculated margin.Only limited consideration was given in these reports to the suitability ofthe various refineries for treating different sorts of crude oil and to the qualities of the products which they could turn out. Moreover, it is evident that someproducts are in shorter supply than others. It is consequently felt that a betterapproach to the problem of evaluating the potential effect of further damagewould be by studying the nature, location and product output potentialities ofthe various refineries in the light of the shortages most likely to become acute.Products most reqtiired from Crude Oil Refineries.Though crude oil provides only a half of the Axis supplies of liquid fuelsand lubricating oils, it is the major source of both Diesel and lubricating oils.The two products which, it is believed, are in shortest supply are just these sametwo, with particular emphasis on high grade lubricants.The quantity of Diesel oil obtainable from the available crude supplies iscertainly well below requirements, but is considerably increased by blending withmotor spirit and with products obtained from coal (notably from the FischerTropsch plants). However, from a refining point of view, a straight Diesel oilis one of the easiest oil products to make, as it can be obtained direct from virtuallyany distillation unit.Lubricant production, on the other hand, requires much more specialisedequipment and the high quality grades can only be made in a few refineries. Inaddition, these high quality grades call for complex testing and refining equip-ment available in only a few centres.* There is also the possibility of the synthetic oil plants being used for the treatment of mineral oil. Some spare capacity might be found in the refinery sections of certain of theseplants, although its use would involve various difficulties. According to one calculation, this additional capacity might be as high as 1,000,000 tons per annum. Another possibility is thatcertain hydrogenation plants at present using liquid tar feedstocks could process mineral oilinstead. This would, however, be at the expense of the loss of output from the feedstocks &quot;derivedfrom coal.
Production and Refinery Capacities in each Area.1. RoumanianRoumania forms a self-contained area with ample refining capacity for itspresent production. The spare capacity was estimated at the end of 1943 at,000,000 t.p.a. by the United States Enemy Oil Committee and 1,685,000 t.p.a.by the Ministry of Economic Warfare, or, say, 20 per cent, and 30 per cent,respectively on the production rate. Since these reports further repairs to therefineries have been effected, notably at the Steaua Romana plant, the full output capacity of which is \\ million t.p.a. Several of the refineries can produceordinary grades of lubricating oil but, unless some unknown plants have beenerected during the war, few, if any, are equipped for making the high grades.2. The Danubian Countries.Next in importance of crude production come the Danubian countries, austria and Hungary, to which might be added the relatively small output fromYugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.In peacetime all these countries possessed refineries (of small, and in manycases of very small, individual capacity), designed to handle mainly importedcrude or crude oil blends prepared specially for easy refining. A number ofthem were equipped for making lubricating oil, but there was hardly a modernplant capable of producing really high-grade products. However, in Hungarytwo refineries have been extended, and a new refinery is in process of being completed at Szony. In Austria a new refinery has been erected at Lobau witha capacity estimated between. 200,000 and 300,000 tons.From small beginnings before the war vigorous drillings has brought abouta rapid increase in production. The total oil production of the Danube Basinis approximately 3,100,000 tons (Austria 2,020,000, Hungary 1,000,000, Yugo-slavia 50,000 and Cechoslovakia 30,000) and the refining capacity in thesecountries is to the order of about 2,000,000 tons. This represents a deficiency of over 1,000,000 tons. If the Yugoslav refineries are assumed to be neutralised,this deficiency would, be greater by another 180,000 tons.A number of these refineries produce lubricants, but the output capacity forhigh-grade lubricants is believed to be small.3. Poland.In Poland there is some 775,000 tons per year capacity for a local production(including Eastern Poland) not exceeding 400,000 tons per year. But here, again,many of the refineries are small and of old design, and it is doubtful if the totalcapacity of efficient units is appreciably in excess of production. The productionof high-grade lubricants is believed to be limited to one plant of small capacity.4. Germany and the Low Countries.Germany built up before the war a modern and efficient refining industrybased essentially on working imported crudes. A number of these refineries wereconveniently placed for handling both imported and indigenous crudes.The refineries in the Hamburg and Hanover area contain sufficient plant forthe production of high-grade lubricating oils to satisfy a large proportion of thetotal Axis requirements, but it is not possible to set an exact figure to this proportion as there may be some output from new plant and from the equipmenttransferred from the disused French refineries.In occupied Western Europe the only refineries which appear to be of immediate practical value to Germany are the Pernis refinery in Holland and the comparatively small refineries in Belgium. None of these are lubricating oilproducers.Apart from crude oil refineries there is distillation and treatment equipmentattached to each of the Bergius synthetic oil plants. This is normally installec&apos;with a small working margin of capacity above the normal synthetic production,and in the case of some plants, where the hydrogenation equipment is being-built in two stages, refining equipment suitable for the full final capacity has beenerected in the first instance.*&apos; Since this report was written a series of attacks upon Ploesti and Campina have dislocatedrefining capacity to, an extent that Roumania is at present incapable of processing more than apart of the country&apos;s potential crude oil production.
One estimate based on normal working margins and on photographic evidenceputs this total spare capacity at 1 million tons per year, but this figure is probablymuch on the high side. In the case of serious emergency much or all of this could be used for simple refining of crude oil, though, of course, no lubricating oils could be produced.In all, the Ministry of Economic Warfare estimates that the useful refiningcapacity available in Germany, Holland and Belgium is some 2,500,000 tons per year in the true oil refineries, plus a possible 1 million tons per year in the synthetic plants. In addition, there are certain special refineries for makinglubricating oils from distillates received from other refineries.Fullest use being made of the German Refineries.Germany&apos;s indigenous production of crude oil is some 800,000 tons per year.In addition to treating this crude, the German refineries process the surplus crude oil from the Danube countries and also distillates from Roumania.Whereas the Polish refineries treat a small part of the surplus crude from the danube Basin, the remainder is evidently moved to Germany. In addition, it isknown that considerable quantities of Roumanian heavy oil were exported forrefining elsewhere and with the object of obtaining a greater yield of high-gradelubricants than the local refineries could provide.It is clear that the German lubricating oil plants are being heavily relied upon for the production of large quantities of lubricants from these imports.Furthermore, the German refineries as a whole must now be running at about their full crude capacity.Effect of Further Destruction.In the light of all these considerations, the effect of the destruction ofrefinery capacity in the various areas can be considered : (1) Roumania. Any reduction in capacity below the minimum necessary toprocess indigenous production would necessitate exporting the crudeelsewhere. Since the refineries in Central Europe and in Germany arealready operating at capacity, the inconveniently situated refineriesin Holland, France and Italy would have to be brought into use.On the other hand, any possible surplus capacity in Roumania can-not be considered as potentially useful for crude from other areasmade homeless by destruction of refineries in such areas. The trans-port system might be able to handle the resultant traffic, but under existing circumstances the Germans would not wish to add to their transport problems.(2) Danubian Countries. The refining capacity of the Danubian countries is deficient to the extent of 1 million tons. Consequently it is assumed that the principal refineries in this area are working atcapacity. Of these there are eight, although it is not known whetherthe two new ones recently constructed (Lobau in Austria and Szony in hungary) are yet in full operation. None of these refineries is of largecapacity.It is believed that the bulk of the surplus is refined in Germany.Any serious impairment of the output of these refineries would notonly entail transporting the crude a considerable distance but wouldalso add to the burden on the refineries in Northern Europe.(3) Poland. The destruction of the principal Polish refineries would add to the surplus crude from the Danube Countries that lias to be trans-ported to the Northern refineries.In any event, the growing proximity of the Russian front reducestheir potential value to Germany.(4) Germany. Whereas the German refineries are of prime importance forthe processing of indigenous crude and the unrefined surplus from the danubian Countries, certain of them are of vital importance as beingthe principal sources of high-grade lubricants.The destruction of only one or two selected refineries would begin to have its effect on the general lubricating oil position by eliminatinga considerable proportion of the total high-grade lubricating oilcapacity.   It is difficult to see, from the knowledge available, how theGermans could replace the loss.
The Misburg refinery, and the Rhenania refinery at Harburg withthe nearby plant at Grasbrook, constitute the key refineries as betweenthem they handle the equivalent of the whole German crude produc-tion. Of no less importance is the fact that they probably produce atleast one half of the total high grade lubricating oil now available toAxis Europe. The combined output capacity of high-grade lubricantsfrom these plants may be to the order of 40,000 tons.Much of the rest of the high-grade lubricants come from theVacuum plant at Oslebshausen (3/40,000 t.p.a. of lubricants), andthe recently enlarged Saltzbergen refinery (originally 25,000 t.p.a. oflubricants) so that if these four could be put out of action the Germanlubricating oil position would be very seriously affected.The effect of destruction on a somewhat larger scale is difficultto assess as knowledge of the actual working capacities of all theavailable refineries is too uncertain and the extent to which distillationequipment in synthetic oil plants, &amp;c, could in practice be drawn on is impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy. Further,in case of real need, the Germans would doubtless be prepared to face the extra transport involved in sending crude oil to refineries now considered unsuitably placed (notably France) rather than accepta reduction in total output. But it might take two months to put the plants, which are not at present in operation, on a working basis.It is reasonably sure that qualities and yields of products would beupset, established routing of oil would be profoundly disturbed, and total transport possibly increased, immediately the importantrefineries in the Hamburg-Hanover area were rendered unusable.Actual output of products would almost certainly be reduced.Conclusions.1.   To reduce substantially the total liquid fuels available to Germany bymeans of attacks on oil refineries it will be necessary to put out of action either (a) over 50 per cent, of the refining capacity of Roumania; or(b) not less than 40 per cent, of the capacities of the following plants : 1. Misburg, Germany. &quot;2. Rhenania, Harburg, Germany.3. Rhenania, Grasbrook, Germany.4. Oslebshausen, Germany,5. Salzbergen, Germany.6. Ebano, Harburg, Germany.7. Eurotank, Hamburg, Germany.8. Lobau, Austria (if completed).9. Florisdorf, Austria.10. Pardubice, Czechoslovakia,11. Kolin, Czechoslovakia.12. Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.13. Czepel, Budapest, Hungary.14. Almas-Fuzito, Hungary.15. Szony, Hungary (if completed).16. Pernis, Holland (not operating, but best placed as reserve forHamburg area).2. The refining capacity in Austria and Hungary is insufficient by asubstantial margin for refining the production of these countries. The immobili-sation of the group numbered 8 to 11 inclusive and of the group numbered 12to 14 inclusive would necessitate a complex redistribution of refining arrange-ments and would cause a serious interruption in the flow of finished products.3. Lack of high-grade lubricating oil refining capacity is the most vulnerable feature of the Axis Europe refining industry. The destruction offrom two to four of the five refineries in north-west Germany, numbered 1 to 5above, would, in view of the present shortage of high-grade lubricants, slow down -the German war machine to an extent proportionate to the lack of these essentialproducts.Note.-The loss of control over Roumanian and/or Polish oil would notdetract from the importance of the above refineries, as the minimumamount of crude oil which would have to be refined in Germany and the danubian countries would be unchanged.
