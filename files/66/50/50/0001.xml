Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.W.P. (44) 300.7th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY  OF SUBORDINATE LEGISLATION.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.AT their Meeting on the 5th May the Cabinet agreed (W.M. (44)62nd Conclusions) that in the debate on Mr. Molson&apos;s Motion I should state thatthe Government were prepared to set up a Committee of the House of commons on the lines indicated in the memorandum circulated by the Chairman of theMachinery of Government Committee (W.P. (44) 223).In the debate on the 17th May I indicated the proposals which the Govern-ment were prepared to make, and these proposals were well received in all quarters of the House.Since the debate consideration has been given to the form of Motion whichwould be appropriate for the setting up of the proposed Select Committee forscrutinising subordinate legislation, and I have conferred thereon with theChancellor of the Exchequer as Chairman of the Machinery of government committee and with the Law Officers.As regards the terms of reference for the proposed Committee, furtherconsideration of the terms suggested in the memorandum W.P. (44) 223 has suggested that these terms might be improved in certain respects, with a view to bringing out more clearly the objects for which the Committee will be appointed and the extent of the Committee&apos;s responsibilities.I attach a draft of a Motion for the appointment of such Committee.Several of the Members who have especially interested themselves in thisquestion have asked that they may have an opportunity of conferring with mebefore the Motion is put down, and I propose to meet representative Membersof Parliament and indicate to them the scope and nature of the Government^proposals.Subject to any considerations which may emerge as the result of such consultation, I suggest that a Motion as in the draft attached be put down at anearly date.As to the size of the proposed Committee, it is in my view important thatif the Committee is to exercise its functions in a judicial spirit the number shouldbe kept as small as possible, and after consultation with the Chief Whip Iunderstand that it is proposed that the Committee should be limited to eleven.The Chief Whips will be in a position to inform the Cabinet of the proposedmembership when they consider this memorandum.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,7th June, 1944.SECRET. - nCfbpy. No.    di[27601]
