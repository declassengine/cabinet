2. According to Axis reports of civilian casualties to date, the score boardreads as follows : Axis Reported Credit BalanceKilled. Remaining.6,062 3,938These figures show that casualties inflicted, as judged by the enemy, are some40 percent, less than our estimates.3. Against these civilian casualties the Transportation Plan already showsconsiderable profits. Some 2,450 Germans have been killed, including 285 of the300 railway specialists despatched from Germany to repair Creil. One reportsays that at Clignancourt 400&apos; Germans celebrating Hitler&apos;s birthday are still under the ruins. Another valuable dividend has been the considerable number ofammunition trains that have been blown up. For the overall effect on Germany&apos;sstrategic plans, we have evidence that the interruption of supply and of troop movements has already been effectively achieved by the Allies.(Signed) A.
