(44),11th Conclusions, Minute 4), I said that I wished to reserve my final judgmentas regards the scheme as a whole, pending the result of the private referencewhich I had made to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad.2. I now circulate to my colleagues herewith, the text of my letters toLord Killearn and Sir K. Cornwallis, together with their replies.A. E.Foreign Office, 15th May, 1944.ANNEX.fill ISSSf! lllltlil:;! 11 illliiLetter from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadorsat Cairo and Bagdad.Foreign Office, 1st February, 1944.I enclose, for your own personal consideration, a copy of the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee which was recently set up to consider a long-term policy for Palestine. This Report should not be shown to any member of your staff, nor to anyone else, without express authority from me. The Report will be consideredby the Cabinet after the Prime Ministers return to London, and I should like,before the Cabinet takes any final decision, to have your views on certain points arising out of it, and on the general effect which the policy therein.recommendedis likely to have on our future relations with the Arab world outsidePalestine/Iraq.You will see that the Cabinet Committee have unanimously recommended the adoption of a long-term policy based on partition; that the Committee have,with expert assistance from MacMichael and officials of the Palestine Govern-ment, recommended a definite scheme of partition which is practically a variantof the scheme recommended in the 1937 Peel Commission^ Report (but that one member of the Committee dissented from the detailed scheme advocated by hiscolleagues, as being in his opinion unjust to the Arabs); and finally, that theCommittee hoped that Arab opposition might be largely counteracted if the partition of Palestine could be linked with a wider scheme for a &quot;GreaterSyria,&quot; although the Committee favour proceeding with partition in any case,whether or not &apos;&apos; Greater Syria &apos;&apos; proves to be feasible.You may possibly be surprised that the Committee, in the light of their knowledge of the past history of Palestine, should have recommended a returnto the Peel rCommission^ policy of partition, which was responsible for so much[27467]        &apos; - ;b
Arab opposition and bloodshed, in the years before the war. I must thereforetry to give you some explanation of the reasons which have led them to this conclusion. The Committee realise that the announcement of this new policy is certain to arouse an outcry from the Arabs (as well as a similar outcry from the zionists). The Committee realise also the essential importance, in Britishinterests, of maintaining tranquillity throughout the Middle East, and fio put it at its lowest) of doing nothing which might endanger our oil supplies. More-over, as the Committee&apos;s report points out, partition may mean local riots anddisturbances in Palestine, and in the view of the Foreign Office there is thefurther danger that rioting and further bloodshed in Palestine may spread allover the Middle East, and. thus involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in an indefinitemilitary commitment, as well as prejudicing their oil interests and all their other interests throughout the whole area. I set out these points in full, because I wouldnot wish you to suppose that they have been overlooked here.Why then, you may ask, in spite of all these grave objections, have theCommittee deliberately come down in favour of partition ? I will try to explain the position as I see it. In the first place, whatever the merits or demerits of thePalestine White Paper of 1939, we must face the fact that it-will almost certainly be politically impossible to hold to the &apos;&apos; White Paper policy &apos;&apos; after the war.Many members of the present Government, including the Prime Minister and several members of the Palestine Committee, voted against the White Paper in1939, and are definitely committed to oppose a policy which, if it could be strictlyenforced, would leave the Jews as a permanent minority in Palestine. the seministers would not feel able, in the light of their past records and of theirpresent sincerely-held convictions, to defend in Parliament the implementation of the White Paper which they feel is fundamentally unjust to the Jews. Noris the question one which can be shelved indefinitely: Sooner or later, the 75,000Jewish immigrants allowed by the White Paper will have entered Palestine, andHis Majesty&apos;s Government will then have to decide whether there is to be any future Jewish immigration or not. There can be little doubt what the presentCabinet&apos;s decision would be. Ministers would be all the more reluctant to close the doors of Palestine to future Jewish immigration, because such a decisions would be bound to have an unfavourable reception in America. In palestine the announcement of a decision to carry through the White Paper policy would cause violent reactions from the Jews, in fact there would very probably be an armed Jewish rising, which in turn would produce an extremely awkward.Parliamentary situation in this country. To avoid such a situation (and, I mustrepeat, in accordance with the strong personal convictions of individual&apos; membersof the present Government) the Cabinet would almost certainly take a decisionkauthorising further Jewish immigration, and scrapping the White Paper&apos; altogether. ,The question that faced the Committee, therefore, was not whether the white paper should be implemented or should not be implemented. The White Papercan be regarded as more or less dead. The question was rather whether or not we must return to the old pernicious system whereby His Majesty&apos;s Government,as the Mandatory authority&quot;, are responsible for allowing further Jewish immigra-tion to an extent only limited by the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine.This means, as we know only too well, ceaseless Zionist pressure on His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in favour of larger quotas, as well as Arab pressure on His Majesty&apos;sGovernment against any quotas at all. It seemed to the Committee that partition,even though not an ideal solution, was1 at least better than this alternative. Underpartition, the burden of responsibility for decisions regarding future jewish immigration would, of course, rest with the Jews themselves.   -Moreover, the Committee felt that the sufferings of Jews in Europe and elsewhere during the past few years have, if anything, strengthened the case for establishing a Jewish State somewhere in the world in order that the Jews, likemost other peoples, shall have a State of their own and, if they so wish, anationality of their own. Whether this would be in the true interests of worldJewry is perhaps ia debatable question. But if there is to be such a Jewish State,it could hardly be elsewhere than in Palestine. This, again, is a strong argument in favour of reverting to a partition plan. ,If Jewish immigration must continue, it is certainly arguable that theannouncement of the revocation of the immigration clauses of the White paper would have a far more damaging effect on British prestige in the Middle^ Eastand create far more resentment in the Arab world than would the announcementof the partition plan. The latter, if accompanied by an offer to terminate the mandates for. Palestine and Transjordan .and to facilitate the creation of a
Greater Syria, would be regarded as a new contribution, and the fact that itpresented a possibility: of finality would at least be in its favour. The revocationof the White Paper, on the other hand, would be considered by the Arabs merely as a gross and heartless breach of faith, leaving finality as far away as ever. TheCommittee felt that we may be able to put partition through without much morethan local and temporary disturbances; but they&apos;were convinced that we cannotdepart from the provisions of the White Paper, while offering nothing substantialin its place, without setting the whole Middle East in a ferment.As regards the actual scheme of partition recommended by the Committee, &quot;you will see that that recommended by the majority of the Committee providesfor a Jewish State which shall include practically the whole of the desirablecultivable land in the country-leaving to the Arabs mainly the hill country anduncultivable areas. The arguments for and against this course, upon which theCommittee were not unanimous, are set out in the Eeport itself, and the minute of dissent annexed to it. I will not attempt to develop these arguments here. i will only mention that the majority of the Committee attached great importanceto the fact that the Zionists will be bitterly disappointed at the comparatively small size of the State which it is proposed to award to them, and that nothingmuch less than this would be regarded as acceptable by even&apos; the more moderateJeW. There are, however, two features of the scheme mentioned in the minute of dissent to which I would like to draw your special attention. You will seethat one of the disputable points is whether the Huleh Salient in the North-east of the proposed Jewish State should in fact be awarded to the Jewish State, orto the Arabs, Another disputable point is the solution recommended by theCommittee for the Negeb in the South. sAs for the &apos;.&quot; Greater Syria &quot; proposal, you should know that the ForeignOffice have some doubts whether this will prove to be feasible. We fully appreciate the desirability of giving the Arabs something they want, namely, a &quot; GreaterSyria,&quot; to counter-balance the ill effects of partition. Much less-concern is likelyto be shown by the Arabs about the disadvantages to them of partition inPalestine if at the same time they.are interested and excited about their ownreunification. But we have to remember that the proposal is not likely to be welcomed ,by the French, who have always been opposed to any idea of &quot;Arabfederation.&quot; Nor is it at all certain that the Syrian Government themselves would wish to enter into a treaty with us on the basis of recognising the establish-ment of a Jewish State m* Palestine. Again, we do not quite see how a &quot; GreaterSyria &quot; would work out, in which the French would be responsible for defence,European advisers and so forth, in the northern part of the State, includingDamascus, whereas the British would be responsible for the same matters in thesouthern part of the State. If, however, it is possible to&apos; overcome these difficulties,so much the better. It would, of course, mean that Trans Jordan would in future be governed from Damascus, and that the Emir Abdullah, if he is not chosen bythe Syrians as their monarch, will have to be retired on a pension.As soon as you have had time to study these points, I should like yourobservations on the whole question, particularly with reference to the problemof our future relations with the Arab world as a whole/Iraq. Your observationswill, I hope, cover the following points: (a) Do you agree with the view expressed in paragraph 17 (1) on page 8 ofthe Eeport that: &quot; In the neighbouring States, the solution [i.e., thesolution recommended, by the Committee) will probably not be regardedas so inequitable as to Warrant ah indefinite prolongation of violentopposition &quot; ? -(b) Do you consider that the opposition of the Arab world would be materially reduced if the Huleh Salient were awarded to the Arabsinstead of to the&apos;-Jews; and, failing the total incorporation of theHuleh Salient in an Arab State, would it make any difference if acorridor five or ten miles wide along the western and northern frontier of the Huleh Salient were awarded to the Arabs in order to providedirect communication between Syria.and Galilee?(c) Would it make any difference if the Negeb were definitely to be promised to the Arabs as soon as its agricultural possibilities had been surveyedand agreement reacthed on the terms of its economic exploitation, if desired, by a Jewish chartered company?&apos;(d) Do; you agree that&apos; the &quot;Greater Syria &quot; proposal, if feasible, would&apos; &apos; greatly dimihish Arab opposition as a whole?   P0: you consider it likely to be feasible and what do you think will happen in the Arab&apos; .     .   [27467]       - . b 2
world as a whole if the &quot; Greater Syria &quot; scheme has to be abandoned^and the partition plan is put into force without it/? i(e) It is, of course, easy to criticise the Committee&apos;s scheme, or any otherscheme for a solution of the Palestine problem. But have you any:better suggestions, apart from the indefinite continuance of the white paper policy, which must be ruled out for the reasons given above?;The above has been written, and indeed, tJhe whole work of the Committeehas been carried out, on the basis of a choice between the continuance of theWhite Paper (or its abandonment without putting anything in its place) and a return to the policy of partition. In so far as any third alternative may be saidto exist, it would perhaps have to be sought in certain ideas reported to be inthe mind of President Roosevelt, who, after Colonel Hoskins, his SpecialEmissary to Ibn Saud, had reported the complete refusal of that Monarch to concur in any handing over of Palestine to the Jews, has switched to a new lineof approach outlined in the following paragraph, which summarises a conversa-tion between the President and Colonel Hoskins in Nevember last : &quot;As to a solution of the Palestine problem, the President stated that,his own thinking leaned toward a wider use of the idea of trusteeship forPalestine-of making Palestine a real Holy Land for all three religions,with a Jew, a Christian, and Moslem as the three responsible trustees.   He.said he realised it might be difficult to get the agreement of the Jews to sucha plan, but if Moslems and Christians of the world were agreed he hoped the Jews could also be persuaded.   This concept to be successful would, he also realised, have to be presented as a solution larger and more inclusivethan the establishment of an Arab State or a Jewish State.   He realised that this idea, of course, required further thought and needed to be worked,out in greater detail, but at least that was the line along which his mind was runnin.&quot;The basic idea contained in the above has been worked out tentatively andwithout authority in the State Department in Washington oh the lines of apermanent Trustee State administered by a High Commissioner responsible tothe United Nations and guided by a Council representing Christians, Moslemsand Jews. Jewish immigration into Palestine would be continued, but would bekept within some fixed relationship to the size of the Arab population. the essence of this plan is the assumption that Arab hostility towards continued:Jewish inmiigratiqn^would be diminished once the nature of the new politicalregime had been established as definitive so that the Arabs no longer had reason;to fear that continued Jewish immigration was intended .to pave the way forJewish political domination.I needpnly add that the Committee&apos;s scheme is known to Casey, Moyxte andMacMichael, who are in general agreement with it, on the assumption that atleast two divisions of British troops are in or close to Palestine when theannouncement is eventually made. There would, of course, be no objection ifyou wished to concert your reply with Cornwallis/Killearn, to whom I am sending a similar letter, and, should you so desire, with MacMichael too, to whom you may, if you wish, show this letter.Yours sincerely,ANTHONY EDEN,P.S.-1 enclose a supplement to the Committee&apos;s report/ which gives further details about the Huleh Salient corridor mentioned in (b) on the preceding page.(2)Letter from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Cairo, to the Secretary jof State forForeign Affairs.Cairo, l$th February, 1944.I received your Most Secret letter of the. 1st February on the 9th february and, in accordance with your directions have neither shown nor revealed it to anyone, including those senior members of my staff whom I should normally have consulted.You request my observations on the whole problem covered by your letter and its enclosures and especially that I will cover in my reply certain pointsitemised in your letter from (a) to (e). \111 11   .^;;:;l...l;-.&quot;&apos;-:l&apos; -,&apos;     &apos; - //.,        &apos; i
I will answer those itemised points one by one, but first I would preface myanswers with one general observation: You record that &quot; the White Paper canbe regarded as more of less dead.&quot; I submit that, in the event of the presentpartition proposals going through, the fundamental provision in the balfour declaration can be regarded as equally dead which runs &apos;&apos; it being clearly under-stood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil.and religiousrights of non-Jewish communities in; Palestine:&quot; I should imagine that this,disregard Of the Balfour ternis as regards non-Jews would arouse much bitternessand edhdemhatioh; The point may have some material importance when it comes to Parliamentary and public debate.I now turn td your itemised points : (a) I do not agree with the passage quoted from the Report. On the contraryhere in Egypt (about which alone I can speak with any authority)there will be prolonged and most bitter opposition. How violent orenduring no one can foretell: but we shall without question be heldguilty of bad faith; and that stigma will remain. Pemember that king F. and the Egyptian Government are committed to and atpresent engaged upon a policy of Pan-Arab ism; that Egypt aims atthe leadership of the Arab States;, that the handing Over of any partof Palestine, to an independent Jewish State will be regarded astorpedoing that policy and a violation of oiif pledges; both raciallyand religiously the reaction to any form of partition will be immediate,violent and deep-rOoted.(&amp;) I do not believe that the inclusion in or exclusion from the new arab state Of the Huleh Salient will materially affect or mitigate the adverse reaction of the local Arabs of of the Arab world. ArabOpinion will dairiri partition, regardless Of the detail. If, hone theless, partition&apos; is decided Upon, despite its recognised dangers, I shouldpersonally advocate&apos; Huleh going to the Afabs, (1) on grounds of equity&apos;; (2) because it will avoid separation of Galilee&quot; from the restof the Arab territory. Corridors, so far as I know, have never been successful devices.   , -..(c) I. do hot believe the promise Or assigninent of the Negeb to the Arabswould decrease Arab resentment Of partition.   I surmise the Arabs. (who know all about the area) WOUld be tempted to regard it in thenature of a &quot; bad joke;&quot;(d) I do not believe the bait of &quot;Greater Syria&quot; (arid I share theForeign Office doubt as to its practicability) will diminish oppositionto partition. The Arabs will continue to maintain that part of thpirland (and admittedly far the best part) has been taken from themarid handed to others. If partition is enforced, whether with or without &quot; Greater Syria,&quot; there will be grave trouble aheadthroughout the whole Middle East. In Egypt, a serious reactionupon relations and charges of bad faith: in the Arab Statespossibilities of bloodshed with in any case repercussions upon ourrelations with each of them individually and together corporately-Saudi Arabia, Irak, Syria, the Lebanon compare what happened tothe French over the Lebanon recently. I should expect religiousreaction as far off as India and Northern Africa : indeed throughoutthe Moslem world. The Cabinet Committee do not seem to havetouched on that-the religious aspect. .(e) As yOU very truly say, it is very easy to criticise.  But I take it you wantmy honest opinion without equivocation : in my replies given above,to your various questions, I disclaim all intent of destructivecfiti^sfn.Now*let me turn to your enquiry whether I have any &quot;bettersuggestions.&quot;   Here are certain thoughts that have passed throughmy mind both before and after reading your letter and the attachedpapers.   First and foremost I had most earnestly hoped that the; problem of&quot;Palestine&apos;?; future could havebeen-left over until after theWar. tf we want, as we surely must, to avoid general unsettlemeritin the whole of the Middle East (arid possibly further afield) is itreally necessary to awaken the question now? Is it not infinitelywisef to leave things as they are, even if a certain amount ofiricreased Jewish immigration may have meantime to be arranged&apos;     1    . somehow ?[27467] B 3
Quite apart from this question of the inopportuneness of theimmediate moment, I have for long felt that were I a dictator Ishould (after the war) tackle Palestine along different lines to any (sofar as I know) hitherto explored. Why not approach the question, ona basis of Imperial Defence and Strategy? Palestine affects twovitally important defence aspects-(1) communications, (2) oil (andI should have surmised that we should not welcome an independent,most probably highly efficient, and possibly aggressive Jewish Statecutting right across both those interests. Any more than Egypt willwith Sinai and the Exodus in their minds). On this basis of Defenceinterest, my thought would be (always post-war) to scrap the Mandateand the White Paper : and come out boldly with a decision to keepPalestine ourselves as a vital link in our Defence system. Whatprecise form our continued occupation should take would have to beconsidered in detail: but our physical control should be definite andunlimited. We would tell both Arab and Jew that we were stayingand why : and add that we should see to it that both races were fairly treated and their interests adequately protected so far ascompatible with our predominant (defence) interest. Both sideswould squeal: but I surmise that they would both eventually submit to force majeure, backed, as it would be, by valid strategical reasons and adequate force.Let me add that my approach to this problem is and has always been fromthe/purely British angle; what is best to our, British, interest. TheBalfourDeclaration has from the start been a millstone round our necks : it contains anunworkable contradiction in terms.I do not myself see that partition need necessarily be the only answer;doubtless we can and will enforce it if such be the final decision. If we do,I agree with the Committee that we may expect violence and must provide forthe permanent retention of adequate force available (where1?) for futureoutbreaks.To sum up, if partition is to be our policy despite its recognised dangers,,the. detail doesn&apos;t seem to me to matter much, though the points made in theMinister of State&apos;&amp; Minority Report seem to me well taken and convincing. ButI feel strongly we should be under no illusion that its execution will not involve us in grave difficulties and odium the ultimate effect of which upon our positionin this.area I should hesitate to predict.Yours sincerely,KILLEARN.P.S. I have taken advantage of your permission and haye sent Cornwallisa copy of this letter.V.&apos;       . . - ; K.(3)Letter from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Bagdad, to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.- . i Baghdad, 24;th February, 1944.: I thank you for your letter of the 1st February. In accordance with,yourinstructions, I have not shown it to anyone or discussed its contents.2. You ask for my observations on the whole question raised in your letter,with particular reference to the problem of our future relations with Iraq, andfor my views on certain specific points.&apos; 3. I have carefully studied the Report of the Cabinet Committee which wasenclosed with your letter. It is not within my competence to offer any detailedcomments on it, though I was impressed by the.points raised in the Minister ofState&apos;s minority, report. I note MacMichaeTs opinion that there will be no seriousdisorder at the time the announcement is made, provided that at least two divisions of British troops are in or near the country. The Palestine Arabs aredisunited and without a leader at the present time, and one would not anticipateorganised resistance at first. It must, however, be remembered that Arab risingsin the past have generally taken some time to mature, and that the Arabs areadepts at&quot; choosing their opportunity.   It will be unwise to assume that they
will be overawed by the fact that we are &quot;on the crest of the wave of victory,&apos;;as the Report puts it. We were in that pleasant position in 1918, but, nevertheless,within the following few years we had serious trouble in Egypt, Iraq, palestine and Syria. The fact that the chief interest of our troops will be to get home assoon as possible after the main hostilities cease is well known to the Arabs, so itmay well happen that they will wait until our seasoned troops are replaced byunits which are less experienced before attempting a rising on a large scale.You will remember that this is what happened in Iraq in 1920.4. For these reasons, I would agree that the first step the announcement ofthe partition policy is unlikely to produce immediate violent reaction on a large scale in Palestine, provided that we show sufficient force. The implementation ofthe policy, however, and its after-effects give cause for very serious anxiety. TheJews will be given a tiny country, and it seems to an outsider that if they areto make anything of it and satisfy the insistent demand for immigration, theywill have to buy the Arabs out or, if that proves impossible, get rid of them insome other way. That would be only natural. His Majesty&apos;s Government, onthe other hand, in fulfilment of the second half of the Balfour Declaration, willbe bound to try and safeguard the rights of the Arabs. The struggle is boundto be protracted and painful. One must expect the strongest opposition from theArabs within the Jewish State, and the constant occurrence of incidents whichwill keep the Moslem world inflamed. The Jewish State will become theterra irredenta, of the Arabs-to be recovered when a favourable moment comes.Effect of Partition on our Relations with Iraq.5. I would first like to say that, especially during the last year, there has grown up a more genuine feeling of friendship here than I have known before. Itbegan soon after the disappearance of Rashid Ali. His revolt came as a shock tomost Iraqis and forced them to realise how near to disaster he had brought theircountry. The restoration of the Regent and fids Government and, above all, thegenerous policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, made a deep and universal impres-sion. This impression has been greatly strengthened by the Atlantic Charter andother pronouncements of the aims for which the United Nations are fighting.The Iraqis, like the rest of the Middle Eastern Arabs, have come to believe thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government have their interests at heart and have accordinglygiven them real co-operation. Their confidence was clearly shown during therecent troubles in the Lebanon, when from the beginning there was an implicitfaith that we would solve them.    ., .   .6. The Iraqis have, however, for many years taken the keenest interest inPalestine, and unrest there has been instantly reflected here. This interest maybe inflamed in times of trouble by local extremist politicians, but it is not theircreation; it touches every Moslem home in the country. People in England are far too prone to ignore its strength and importance.7. The Iraqis up to the present have the same faith in our intention to implement the White Paper of 1939 as they had in our ability to restrain the French in the Lebanon, and for that reason rumours of Zionist activities have caused no acute anxiety. They do not think that the White Paper satisfies Arabrights, but they are willing to regard it as a reasonable settlement in the circum-stances. Its abrogation or, indeed, any material whittling down of it would comeas a great shock and would be regarded as a gross breach of faith. Still more, Ibelieve, would the setting up of a Jewish State whether of the whole of Palestineor a part is only a question of degree -be held a betrayal. They would think wehave been cheating them all this time and that we have obtained their co-operationunder false pretences. Their confidence in us would be destroyed and friendship,so slowly gained, turned again into distrust. This change would come reluctantly,since the majority of Iraqis genuinely Want to remain our friends, and they would hope at first that the decision was not final. Its pace would depend, I think, to alarge degree on the reactions of the Palestinian Arabs. If the latter were to keepquiet at first, I would anticipate protests and appeals by responsible elements inthis country and, when hope was abandoned, an intense indignation, the rapidrise to influence of hostile extremist elements, and the standing aloof in disillusionof those who have been our best supporters. If there were riots in Palestine, Iwould expect hostile demonstrations here and attempts to attack the Jews andpossibly individual British subjects. The lower-class populations of Baghdad,Mosul&apos; and Basrah are notoriously vicious, and the extent of the damage theywould do would depend on the strength and disposition of the Government in power. I would expect the minimum of co-operation from the Government and a cessation of the friendly associations which exist at present. Disorders would belikely to increase as refugees found their way here from Palestine.  It is early yet
to say whether extra troops would be needed to protect our communications, oiland other interests.8. Should a full-scale rebellion break out in Palestine, the Arab countries would no doubt consult each other. I would not expect them to join in while our forces are still mobilised, but they would help surreptitiously with money, arms orvolunteers. They would be as unaccommodating as they dared,, and effective co-operation would cease.9. At the end of the war in the Far East, our army would presumably be dueto go home and leave the protection of our interests to the Royal Air Force atHabbaniyah. Whether the latter would be sufficient is a matter on which no useful opinion would be expressed. At the least, I fear that Iraq would have to be permanently erased from the list of the&apos; countries in which we have friendlyinfluence, and the maintenance of our oil and other interests would be precarious.Effect on the Neighbouring Arab Countries and on the Moslem World.10. I note that the Committee have endeavoured to predict the reactions ofthe Arabs in neighbouring Arab countries to partition, but that no considerationappears to have been paid to the question of its effect on the Moslem world as awhole. May I venture tc suggest that this should be done. Owing to its historicaland religious associations, Palestine has; with the Hejas, a special place in thehearts of all Moslems, and I feel that the grant of part of the country to the Jews,who have for so many centuries occupied a position of inferiority in the East,will shock them profoundly. I do not believe they will ever acquiesce in such adecision. In particular I hope the probable reaction of the Moslems in india will be examined.11. As regards the countries of the Middle East, I would expect their actions to be much the same as those of Iraq our relations would, I think, be permanently impaired and our interests imperilled.Arab Federation and Partition.12. In my despatch No. 282 of the 4th October, 1941, I remarked that the underlying motive of Arab federation is in its essence anti-foreign, because it isinspired by a wish to form a block of Arab States strong enough to secure Arabaims in Palestine and Syria, to strengthen the independence of all the arab countries and to present a united front to foreign Powers, especially Great Britainand France. I also expressed the opinion that Arab federation was not against our interests so long as our policy marched with that of the Arabs, and that in any- case we should not attempt to stem a current which was bound to grow stronger as time went on. The policy of Has Majesty&apos;s Government towards the Arabs duringthis war has been extremely wise, and the Arab leaders have gone quietly along,maturing their plans. The Arab public have taken a benevolent but not anenthusiastic interest in the matter and, while some useful agreements may be madeon economic and cultural matters, federation on the political side still seems present circumstances far distant.1 The only sign of it so far is Nuri Pasha&apos;sstatement that Iraq and Syria have agreed privately to have the same foreign and defence policy, and that the Amir Abdullah wishes to join them. He hasvolunteered this information and so far there is nothing sinister in the plan.13. We.have, however, had a useful object-lesson recently in the Lebanesedisorders, and the unanimity with which all. Arab States raised their voicesin. protest should be taken as a warning. There is no doubt in my own mind that,if the partition scheme is put into force, all the Arab States will be drawn closer,and. the political federation which would in normal conditions be of such slowgrowth will be rapidly developed to the danger of our position in the Middle East.The Formation of a Greater Syria as a Palliative. &apos;.14. I do not believe that the offer to create a Greater Syria, in the manner proposed, would soften the blow, for the gift offered is far less than what the.Arabs expect. Ever since you gave your blessing to &quot;any movement amongthe Arabs to promote economic, cultural or political unity,&quot; the Arab leaders,in this country at any rate, have assumed that they are at liberty ,to go ahead and that any arrangement which they may make, provided that it is.notcontrary to Allied interests or in conflict with the White Paper of 1939, willmeet with sympathy. They gave great importance to your announcement, andin&apos;order that there should be no suspicion or misunderstandings they have beencareful to keep us informed of what theywere doing, and we have been takeninto the confidence of Ibn Saud, Nahas Pasha, Nuri Pasha and others.    We
have from time to time advised them to take no hasty action, but we have never,so far as I remember, criticised their proposals in any way. Nuri Pasha&apos;s plans for a Greater Syria, which have been discussed with other Arab Governments,have been received without comment by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and it is,notunnatural that he should assume that no fundamental objection exists to their adoption. Both he and other Iraqis feel that they have been given a fair windand I have little doubt that the same feeling exists in other Arab countries.15. In these circumstances, I cannot think that the Committee&apos;s offer: so far less comprehensive than what the Arab leaders themselves have in mind will gild the partition pill. An offer of this sort will certainly not be considered;as a new development, since the Arab leaders have for many months beenconsulting on the assumption that something of the sort will come about, thoughwhether there should be an association of Levant States within their presentfrontiers or a Greater Syria as proposed by Nuri Pasha appears to be stillundecided in their minds. Nuri Pasha is now inclined to favour the former, ashe does not think that the Arabs of Palestine would wish to be incorporatedwith Syria. Being out of touch with the local situation, I am unable to givea useful&apos;opinion regarding the feasibility of the Greater Syria proposal on othercounts. I should, however, be extremely surprised if the Syrian Governmentwere to agree to enter into a treaty with us on the basis of recognising theestablishment of a Jewish State in Palestine.16. As regards the proposed division of the area into British and Frenchspheres of influence, a recent remark of Nuri Pasha to me that the Syrianleaders have told him that they will never sign a treaty with the French maybe of interest. Although I do not think that the proposal of the Committeewill diminish Arab opposition to the partition scheme, a deplorable effect would no doubt be caused by the failure to provide adequately for the future of the Arabswho live in the truncated districts of Palestine. I suggest that it would be wise to allow them and the Trans Jordanians and the Syrians to decide the futurecomposition of the whole area. Article 3 of the Atlantic Charter has beentaken at its literal meaning by the Arab world and is regarded as a solemnpledge by the British and American Governments.The Huleh Salient.17. I do not believe that the Arab world will agree to the surrender of any land to the Jews, or that the award of the Huleh Salient to the Arabs would materially reduce their opposition. If, however, the salient is granted to the jews and the Arabs resist the decision by force, repercussions throughout the Moslemworld will be by so much the more serious. Since the population is largely Arab,I would expect a special grievance to be created. The establishment of a corridorbetween Syria and Galilee would not, in my opinion, placate the Arab world inthe least, though it seems a necessity for the local Arabs.The Negeb.18.   My remarks above apply also to the Negeb.   I venture to suggest thatconditional awards always arouse suspicion.Timing.19. If His Majesty&apos;s Government finally decide to adopt the partitionscheme, I sincerely hope that they will not announce their decision until both germany and Japan have been defeated. To set the whole of the Middle East ina ferment at a time when our communications and oil are of such vital importancewill surely prove a grave embarrassment. In this matter the effect of enemy propaganda on Indian Moslem opinion should not be lost sight of.President Roosevelt&apos;s Idea of a Permanent Trustee State.20. If this proposal were put to the Arabs as an alternative to the white paper, they would, no doubt, reject it; if it were offered as an alternative topartition it would, I think, be preferred, since there would be no fear of Jewishpolitical domination over any part of the country. It would be difficult to persuade the Moslem world to accept the basic idea of the scheme as a permanent settlement; but if that were achieved the readiness with which the Arabs would fall into line would depend largely on the question of representation on theCouncil and the ratio of Jewish to Arab population. As it is proposed that theHigh Commissioner should be responsible to the United Nations, I assume thatthe proposal would be made by the latter.   If His Majesty&apos;s Government have
finally decided to abrogate the White Paper of J939, ,1 recommend that thisscheme be further examined. It is important, in my view, that any departure from the White Paper should have the open support of the Allies, and particu-larly of the Americans, Russians and French. If this is not secured, the influence of other Governments and particularly that of the United States will rise inthe Middle East in proportion as our stock falls..21. I am sorry that I have no fresh suggestion to offer on this vexedquestion. It is, as you say, very easy to criticise, but I have assumed that youwant my honest opinion, and, in giving it, I fear at inordinate length, I have onlystated what I believe will be the result of putting a partition scheme into force.After many years in the East I am neither anti-Zionist nor an Arab enthusiast,and, in saying that I would deplore the abrogation of the White Paper, Iam thinking solely of the grave and enduring troubles which I believe will comeon us in the future. -1 am an optimist in most things, and it is with great regret that I am unable to accept the hopeful views of the Cabinet Committee.22.   I am sending a copy of this to Killearn, with whom I have been in touch.Yours sincerely,KINAHAN CORNWALLIS.
