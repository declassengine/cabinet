Printed for the War Cabinet.  May 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 282.31^ May, 1944.WAR CABINET.PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF BRITISH AIRLINES.Joint Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council, the Ministerof Labour and National Service and the Home Secretary.1. The Memorandum of the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (44) 263 (Revise)) raisesan issue of acute political controversy. He asks for a decision in principle that civil air transport should be operated under conditions of competition and privateprofit.  We are unable to accept this.2. The Lord Privy Seal assumes that British civil aviation has now reached a profit-making stage when it will cease to be a burden on the Exchequer andthat, therefore, the profits should go to private enterprise, which will have theadvantage of all the money spent by the State in pioneer work. Private enterpriseis also to profit by the provision of airfields, radio and meteorological facilities bythe State. It will also enjoy the wide possibilities of concealed subsidy throughthe mail contracts.3. If it is a fact that civil air transport is now likely to be a payingproposition we see no reason why the State should not reap the benefit of its heavy expenditure in the past. But no figures are given in support of the assertion that civil aviation is likely to pay even with the advantages postulated, for it. past experience,which we are asked to disregard, does not warrant it. America,with itsexceptional advantages as a great continent, offers no parallel to the conditionswhich face us. No consideration is given in the paper to the conditions whichare likely to be laid down by the international air convention.4. The arguments brought forward in favour of a multiplicity of competingundertakings in transport are those which were very popular a hundred yearsago, when railways were starting, but which have been signally falsified by experience. It took the last war to reduce the railway companies to four underthe Railways Act, 1921.  We know of no serious suggestion to reverse the process.5. But apart from theory there are serious practical objections to theproposal of the Lord Privy Seal. Competition will inevitably mean duplicationof staffs, uneconomic use of machines and the paying of fees to a number of unnecessary directors. The less profitable routes would be neglected. Then thosewhich were necessary from the point of view of our imperial responsibilities would have to be subsidised by the Government.6. We consider that civil air transport should be a service to be operated in the interests of the people of this country, of the Commonwealth and Empireand of world intercourse. The strategic and administrative requirements of awidely scattered Empire are in themselves enough to make the predominance ofcommercialism undesirable in this service. In view of the lessons of the war whichhave demonstrated the importance of air transport to all three fighting serviceswe consider that our civil air service should be so organised that it can in time of need be easily transformed for war purposes.[27548]
7. We are in favour of civil aviation being transferred after the war tothe Ministry of War Transport and of it being operated through a public corporation manned by a first-class management. It should be largely independent of ministerial control except on broad long-term policy. In our view, if Britishindustry is to hold its own in the post-war world,, transportation should beregarded as the servant of industry and not as a subject for the competition ofrival groups of capitalists. Rail, road and air transport should be operated undera single Ministry as co-ordinated services in the interests of the nation.C. R. A. ,)E. B.H. M.31st May, 1944.
