QZcZ cit*J ^&amp;L/  %ij(ja-a. (&amp;rTSf. \THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1944.1/22SECRET. /   Copy No. 3W.P. (44) 287.3lst-May, 1944.WAR CABINET.RECRUITMENT FOR THE INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE and indian POLICE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I propose, as soon as military considerations permit, to resume recruitment for the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police, broadly on the lines hithertoadopted:As a result of the cessation of recruitment and the demands which have beenmade upon them to provide personnel for important special posts created to dealwith,matters arising out of the war, these Services have been subjected to a very heavy strain. An abnormal number of vacancies is therefore to be expected assoon as retirement is permissible, particularly since an increasing number ofofficers: now serving have already reached the normal age for retirement.Accordingly, both the present Viceroy and his predecessor have urged upon methat, if the administration of India is to be maintained in proper order and,indeed, in a fit state to be handed over without unfairness to a successor Govern-ment, resumption of recruitment, and, in particular, of European recruitment, atthe earliest practicable moment is essential.On the assumption that to attract European candidates of the highestquality it is necessary to hold out the prospect of a full career of 25 or 30 years&apos;service, and in order to avoid the imputation of acting inconsistently with the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government which the promise of so long a career would afford, Lord Linlithgow suggested for consideration the creation ofan Imperial Overseas Service, members of which would be interchangeablebetween India, Burma and the Colonies, so that, those rendered redundant inIndia could be absorbed elsewhere. But, after careful examination of thissuggestion by my Advisers, I am of the opinion that such an arrangement is neither practicable nor capable of providing a satisfactory solution of theproblem.. I have come to the conclusion that the only course which will meet the situationis the resumption of recruitment broadly on the lines on which it has been conducted in the past, but with certain important modifications in the terms of appointment,designed on the one hand to offer sufficient attractions to suitable candidates,and on the other hand to forestall, as far as possible, allegations by indian political opinion of a change of policy on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.These modifications are (a) the inclusion in the regulations of a clear intimation that candidates recruited under them will be liable to have their appointmentsterminated at any time after an appropriate period of notice if, as a result of constitutional-changes, it becomes necessary to dispense with their services; and(b) the appointment of recruits on the basis no longer of pensionable service but of contribution to a provident fund, combined with the assurance of a gratuityin the event of such discharge, graduated according to the length of servicerendered. ^My Advisers have given a great deal of careful thought to the problem and are in agreement with my proposal to resume recruitment as soon as possible on the lines suggested. I hope that my colleagues will approve the proposal,Avhich I am satisfied is necessary if an administrative breakdown is to be avoided.Whatever may be the future constitutional developments, it is in India&apos;s essentialinterest that the efficiency of the administrative machine should be effectivelymaintained. - T   ^L.
