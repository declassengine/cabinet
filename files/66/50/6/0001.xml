SECRET. &quot;. Copy No.W.P. (44) 256.lQth May, 1944.WAR CABINET.EMPLOYMENT POLICY.Publicity for the White Paper.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.I think that it would be useful to draw the attention of the War Cabinet tothe importance of securing the right initial publicity for the forthcoming white paper on employment policy after the war. This is a document of great signifioance and it is most desirable that the policies and principles to which HisMajesty&apos;s Government commits itself should be properly understood and, ifpossible, accepted by the people of this country, as well as by the peoples of othercountries who will be affected by their implementation. The conception that these principles can be scientifically applied is itself something of a novelty, and it isno doubt true that it will need exposition through sustained publicity before thepublic is really alive to the meaning of all that the White Paper sets out to do.Nevertheless, the handling of the initial publicity is itself of importance,&apos; and i therefore put forward the following proposals as to the methods that should beadopted : ; &apos;(1) This should be treated as an occasion on which there should be a widei advance-distribution of the White Paper to the Press, always, ofcourse, on the strict understanding that there can be no publishedreference to the contents until the Paper has actually been presented to the House of Commons. The distribution should be not only toLobby Correspondents in the usual way, but also to other members ofthe Press, particularly the Provincial Press, who do not possess LobbyCorrespondents; to the editors of the influential weekly papers; andto Empire and American correspondents. such an advance-distribution, to serve its purpose, should give two clear days before theday of publication. t(2) The issue of the Paper should be accompanied by a brief summary, whichcan be prepared in the Ministry of Information, drawing attentionto the main problems studied in the Paper and to the specific proposalswhich it puts forward for dealing with them.(3) The right day for the Paper to be laid in the House, to secure the besthandling of the publicity, is Tuesday or Wednesday.(4) It would certainly be a help to the public understanding of a complicatedtheme of this sort if the Minister of Reconstruction would undertaketo see representatives of the Press at the time of issue. A conference with Lobby Correspondents on the morning that the Paper is laid inthe House, and a conference later in the day for financial andindustrial correspondents of the principal papers, would, I am sure,be useful assistants to securing the right line in the Press.B. B.Ministry of Information, &apos;16th May, 1944.[27473]Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.
