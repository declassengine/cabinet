(44) 269. v f21th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.oil discussions with united states government atWashington.Report of Ministerial Oil Committee.(A) General.THE War Cabinet, at their Meeting on the 5th April (W.M. (44) 45thConclusions, Minute 1), approved the instructions for our official delegation tothe explanatory oil discussions in Washington. We have now considered the delegation^ report and are in a position to make recommendations to the Cabinet.2. The delegation have emphasised to us the frank and friendly nature ofthe discussions, and the desirability, in their view, of proceeding to the next stageas rapidly as possible, before there is any chance of a change in the atmosphere.At an early stage the United States delegation tabled a &quot; draft memorandumof understanding,&quot; which was accepted &quot;as a working document calculated tobring to light the various points requiring exploration before consideration by ministers. The document underwent several important changes in substanceduring the talks, though the United Kingdom delegation refrained fromproposing alterations in form and wording, lest by proposing amendments theyshould imply commitments. If, however, the general lines of the suggestedagreement commend themselves to the Cabinet, there should be little difficultyin amending its form in the final discussions. A copy of the form submittedby the two delegations is annexed to this report as Appendix A. An amendedversion prepared by the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, and ^embodyingvarious drafting alterations which we think it -desirable, though not essential,to obtain, is attached as Appendix B.(B) Draft Agreement.3. The preamble sets out certain general principles. The acceptance bythe United States of the second, that petroleum resources are adequate, removesthe suggestion of scrambling for scant supplies which helped to embitter public controversy. In the third the words &quot; relevant economic factors&quot; were inter-preted by the United States delegation as covering the protection of our foreign exchange position.4. Article I declares the intention of the two Governments &quot; to concerttheir efforts to ensure &quot; the exploration and development of petroleum so as tomake petroleum available to all &quot;peace-loving&quot; countries on an equitable and non-discriminatory basis; to encourage economic development of the producing countries; to respect the principle of equal opportunity; and to respect eachother&apos;s concessions.   This last is of practical advantage to the United Kingdom.5. Article II proposes a multilateral conference and organisation &quot; as soonas practicable.&quot;6.   Article III sets up a joint petroleum commission to prepare estimates of world supply and demand and to make recommendations to the two Govern-ments, in accordance with the principles already laid down, on the broad policy[27529] - b
of oil production and distribution, as also on short-term questions of common interest. This last question is of special immediate value, as it should prevent a repetition of such episodes, for example, as the unhappy public discussionof the Saudi Arabian pipe-line.   -(C) Outstanding Points.7. Two points of difficulty arise. The draft document covers petroleum&quot;available in international trade.&quot; The United States Government is in aposition to deal with its domestic resources (except its exportable surplus) as national policy may dictate. The difference between this position and that ofthe United Kingdom was stressed, by the United Kingdom delegation and wasnot disputed by the United States delegation, who in fact assumed that we would use resources under our control primarily in our national interest. The words&quot; relevant economic factors &quot; in paragraph 3 of the Preamble were understood to cover such questions as the protection of our foreign exchange position.Further, it would be the duty of the United Kingdom delegation to the JointPetroleum Commission to take particular care of all British and Imperial trade interests. As for the question of national security, the United States delegationsuggested that in preparing estimates of demand for discussion by the JointCommission, the United Kingdom delegation to that Commission would no doubttake full account of all our requirements. In fact, it seems difficult to draft amore precise reservation of our position which would not seem inconsistent withthe general principles of the document.8. The second point of difficulty arises in paragraph 5 of Article I. the delegation was authorised to lead the discussion towards a declaration that each government would not only respect concessions granted to the other&apos;s nationals,but would support such concessions. This was not acceptable to the UnitedStates delegation. They feared the&apos; effect, particularly on South american governments, of a statement that they and we would jointly &quot; police &quot; conces-sions, and they feared the possibility of statements in the United States that theywere agreeing to take military action in our interest.9. On balance, we have come to the conclusion that both these points mightbe pressed further in the next stage of the discussions, but not to breaking point.10. The Saudi Arabian pipe-line was raised towards the end of thediscussion, in &quot;off the record &quot; talks outside the sessions of the conference. It-was not pressed unduly, and the United States representatives said that if agreement was reached rapidly between the two Governments, the pipe-line, withother immediate questions, should be remitted to the Petroleum Commission.(D) Recommendations.11. We are impressed by the frank and friendly atmosphere whichsurrounded the discussions, and by the readiness of the United States delegation to talk on6a practical basis. That atmosphere and that basis ,may change if thequestion becomes again an election issue. It seems important, therefore, to conclude at once an agrement which gives us certain practical advantages andsets up machinery to deal with oil questions without public controversy. Itwould seem difficult for a Ministerial delegation to leave for Washington atpresent, or, for other reasons, for United States Ministers to come to London.We therefore recommend (a) that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington be instructed iinme-diately to continue the discussions at the Ministerial level, assistedas necessary by officials sent out for the purpose;(b) that he be empowered to conclude an agreement on the. general lines ofthe drafts annexed to this report, subject to his endeavouring (i) tofind a form of words, acceptable to the United States Government,more expressly reserving our full rights to make any provision wethink fit in the interest of national security, and (ii) to persuade theUnited States Government to agree to a joint declaration of supportby each Government of concessions held by the other&apos;s nationals, but(c) that if his endeavours are unsuccessful, the agreement should nevertheless be concluded.L., Chairman(On behalf of the Committee).24th May, 1944.
Draft Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of theUnited States and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom on Petroleum submitted by the United States and United KingdomDelegations.Preamble.THE Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, whosenationals hold, to a substantial extent jointly; rights to explore and developpetroleum resources in other countries, recognise  1. That ample supplies of petroleum,* available in international trade tomeet increasing market demands, are essential for both the security and economic well-being of nations.2. That for the foreseeable future the petroleum resources of the worldare adequate to assure the availability of such supplies.3. That such supplies should be derived from the various producing areasof the world with due consideration of such factors as availablereserves, sound engineering practices, relevant economic factors, andthe interests of producing and consuming countries, and with a viewto the full satisfaction of expanding demand.4. That such supplies should be available in accordance with the principlesof the Atlantic Charter.I.The two Governments agree that the development of petroleum resources should be expanded in an orderly manner on a- world-wide basis with due consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph 3 of the Preamble and within the framework of applicable laws or concession contracts. To this endthey will concert their efforts to ensure, with respect to petroleum resources inwhich rights are held or may be acquired by the nationals of either country :  *1. That petroleum shall be available in international trade to the nationals of all peace-loving countries in adequate volume, at fair prices andon an equitable and non-discriminatory basis. - .2. That the development of petroleum resources and the benefits receivedtherefrom by the producing countries shall be.such a;s to encourage the sound economic advancement of those countries.3. That the development of these resources shall be conducted with a viewto the availability of adequate supplies of petroleum to both countries as well as to all other peace-loving countries, subject to the provisionsof such collective security arrangements as may be established.4. That, with respect to the acquisition of exploration and developmentrights in areas not now under concession, the principle of equalopportunity shall be respected by both Governments.5. That the Government of each country and the nationals thereof shall, respect all valid concession contracts and lawfully acquired rights,and shall make no effort unilaterally to interfere, directly or indirectly,with such contracts or rights.6. That the exploration for and development of petroleum resources, theconstruction and operation of refineries and other facilities, and thedistribution of petroleum. shall not be hampered by restrictions imposed by either Government or its nationals, inconsistent with thepurposes of this Memorandum of Understanding.- u ,  rj .....   ....The two Governments recognise that the principles&apos; declared in Article Ihereof are of general applicability and merit adherence on the part of all nationsinterested in the international petroleum trade of the world. .Therefore, with a view to the wider adoption and effectuation of theprinciples embodied in this Memorandum of Understanding they agree that, assoon as practicable, they will propose to the Governments of other interestedproducing and consuming countries an International Petroleum. Agreement which,* &quot;Petroleum&quot; throughout this document is used to - signify crude petroleum and itsderivatives.,   [27529] &apos; B 2
inter alia, would establish a permanent International Petroleum Council composedof representatives of all signatory countries.To this end the two Governments hereby pledge themselves to formulate plans for an international conference to consider the negotiation of such a multilateralPetroleum Agreement. They also pledge themselves to consult with other interested Governments with a view to taking whatever action is necessary toprepare for the proposed conference.III.There are, however, numerous problems of joint immediate interest to the twoGovernments, with respect to petroleum resources in which rights are held or maybe acquired by their nationals,, which must be discussed and resolved on aco-operative interim basis if the general petroleum supply situation is not to deteriorate.With this end in view the two Governments hereby agree to establish aJoint Petroleum Commission to be composed of ten members, five members to beappointed immediately by each Government. This Commission, in furtherance of and in accordance with the principles stated in Article I hereof, shall considerproblems of mutual interest to both Governments and their nationals, and, witha view to the equitable disposition of such problems, shall be charged with thefollowing duties and responsibilities : 11. To prepare long-term estimates of world -demand for petroleum, havingdue regard for the interests of consuming countries and expandingconsumption requirements.2. To suggest the manner in which, over the long term, this estimated demandmay best be satisfied by production equitably distributed among thevarious producing countries in accordance with the criteriaenumerated in paragraph 3 of the Preamble.3. To recommend to both Governments broad policies for adoption byoperating companies with a view to effectuating programmes suggestedunder the provisions of paragraph 2 above.4. To analyse such short-term problems of joint interest as may arise inconnection with production, processing, transportation and distribu-tion of petroleum on a world-wide basis, wherever the nationals of either country have a significant interest, and to recommend to both governments such action as may appear appropriate.5. To make regular reports to the two Governments concerning its activities.6. To make, from time to time, such additional reports and recommendations to the respective Governments as may be appropriate to carry out thepurposes of this Memorandum of Understanding.The Commission shall establish such organisation as is necessary to carryout its functions under this Memorandum of Understanding. The expenses ofthe Commission shall be shared equally by the two Governments.&quot;   IV. ... &apos; &apos;  .

That upon approval of the recommendations of the Commission they will endeavour, in accordance with their respective constitutionalprocedures, to give effect to such approved recommendations and,wherever necessary and advisable, to ensure that the activities of their nationals will conform thereto.4. That each Government will undertake to keep itself adequately informed of the current and prospective activities of its nationals with respect1 - , to the development, processing, transportation and distribution ofpetroleum. ,   ,...   ,-
5. That each Government will make available to the Commission such information regarding the activities of its nationals as isnecessary to the realisation of the purposes of this Memorandum of understanding.V.This Memorandum of Understanding shall continue in force until six monthsafter notice of termination by either Government or until superseded by theInternational Petroleum Agreement contemplated in Article II.APPENDIX B.First Re-draft (prepared by the Legal Adviser, Foreign Office) of thedraft Anglo-American Memorandum of Understanding on Petroleum.^The Government of the United States and the Government of the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland;Having regard to the fact that, in addition to the existence of petroleumresources within territories under their respective authority, rights to exploreand develop such resources in other countries are held by their respective nationalsand that to a substantial extent such rights are held by corporations or companies in which their respective nationals are jointly interested; andRecognising 1. That it is essential both for the security and the economic well-being of the world that ample supplies of petroleum should be available to meetincreasing demands for this product;2. That, for the foreseeable future, the petroleum resources of the worldare adequate for this purpose;3. That it is desirable, with a view to the full satisfaction of the increasing demands, that the petroleum resources of the world should be developed and expanded in an orderly manner within the framework of the laws andconcessionary contracts applicable thereto and with due regard to such factors as available resources, sound engineering practice, governing economic factors and the interests of producing and consuming countries; and4. That petroleum supplies should be available in international trade inaccordance with the principles of the Atlantic Charter; and considering that the attainment of the aforesaid objectives will be faciliated by an agreement between them for the adoption of a common policy with regardto these matters :Have accordingly agreed as follows : &apos;Article 1.In this Agreement 1.
