Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.copy No.SECRET.W.P. (44) 289.31st May, 1944.WAR CABINET.BULGARIA AND THE SOVIET UNION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may be interested to see the annexed note by Sir OrmeSargent on Soviet intentions towards Bulgaria.Soviet intentions towards Bulgaria both long-term and short-term are stillobscure, but we may safely assume that the Soviet Union wish to be regarded by the Bulgarian people at the end of the war as saviours rather than asconquerors, hoping thereby to establish themselves in a dominating moralposition. The Soviet Government may want something tangible in addition, suchas air bases and other facilities of a similar character.2. There has always been a possibility that in order to ingratiate them-selves with Bulgaria the Soviet Government might offer to secure an outlet tothe iEgean for Bulgaria at the peace settlement. This we should certainly want to oppose in the interests of Greece and to a lesser extent of Turkey, who attachesimportance to having a direct land frontier with Greece. Some time ago we made it clear to the Soviet Government that we could not stand for any territorialconcessions being made to Bulgaria at the expense of our Allies, and up till now the Soviet Government have not disputed our point of view.3. As it has turned out, far from cajoling Bulgaria, Soviet propagandasuddenly began a short time ago to take a very stiff line with the bulgarian government and the Soviet Government have now followed this up with aseries of notes to the Bulgarian Government protesting against the facilities the latter have been granting the Germans, demanding the opening of SovietConsulates at Bulgarian ports as a sign of Bulgarian good faith, and finallywarning the Bulgarian Government that, unless satisfaction is received,diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and the Soviet Government will besevered. As a consequence of these exchanges the Bulgaria Government hasresigned and the Bulgarian Regents have so far found it impossible to form anew one. The grip of the present Bulgarian rulers over the country is none too strong and they are precisely those minority elements in the country opposedto Russia. It is very possible, therefore, that the aim of the Soviet Governmentis, either by means of a coup d&apos;Etat or by diplomatic pressure, to set up aGovernment composed of those minority elements which would at once establishRussian influence in Bulgaria and bring the country out of the war. Evenshould it fail to do this, the present Soviet intervention will have been useful if it forces the Germans to take over Bulgaria as they have taken over Hungaryat the cost of stationing in the country divisions which they can ill -spare for thepurpose.A.

4. But the Soviet Government in their dealings with Bulgaria will haveto bear in mind the danger that by establishing friendly relations with Bulgariathey do not prejudice their position in Yugoslavia (a bird in the hand is worthtwo in the bush). This means that they must solve the Yugoslav-Bulgarianproblem, which has hitherto forced any third Power to choose between one country or the other. The kernel of the Yugoslav-Bulgarian problem is theMacedonian question. Tito, however, is making this easy for Stalin by advocatingan autonomous Macedonia. This is what Bulgaria has always demanded, sincethe greater part of the territory would come from Yugoslavia, or rather fromSerbia, and the autonomous State would naturally gravitate towards Bulgaria,whom it would rely upon to defend it against the Serbs. But in Tito&apos;s plan thetendency for Bulgaria thus to absorb Macedonia would be countered by thecreation of a Southern Slav Confederation, of which this autonomous Macedoniawould be a constituent member. On these terms Tito would agree that Yugoslaviashould abandon Serb Macedonia. This idea of a confederation, incidentally, wasadvocated before the war by most of the Left-wing groups in Bulgaria andCroatia in opposition to the Pan-Serbs, and it is precisely through these partiesthat the Soviet Government are now most likely to establish their influence inthe Balkans generally.5. An autonomous Macedonia, and still more a Slav confederation, wouldbe viewed with profound suspicion by the Greeks, who would see in it not merelya threat to their Northern provinces but the isolation of Greece in the face ofa Slav hegemony of the Balkans. It is true that Tito&apos;s &quot; Foreign Minister &quot; hasdenied in a recent interview that the Macedonia which Tito wishes to establishwould include any Greek territory, but it is significant that General Velebit, in private conversation when in London, talked freely about including in the new state those Macedonians who are now domiciled in Greek territory.6. Apart from these considerations, an autonomous Macedonia might wellbe the best solution of this age-long tangle, and, had there been any hope of bringing about not merely a Slav, but an all-Balkan confederation which would,include Greece and Roumania, there might have been considerable advantages inthis scheme from our point of view.7. But, if an autonomous Macedonia is to be only the first step towards aPan-Slav confederation in South-Eastern Europe, the idea would be definitely toour disliking. First, because it would isolate Greece and weaken her positionin the Balkans, and, secondly, because such a Slav confederation would revive and press Bulgaria&apos;s claim to an outlet in the iEgean at Greece&apos;s expense. But, above all, such a confederation would be objectionable because it would almost certainly be under direct Russian patronage, and as such it would constitute a directchallenge to the British position in the Balkans and Turkey. It is true thatMolotov has recently denied to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that Bulgaria mightbe bought by the offer of Greek Macedonia and has said that the Macedonianquestion is not an urgent one and that Soviet circles do not attach importance tothe statement recently made by Tito&apos;s &quot; Foreign Minister &quot; in favour of a Slavconfederation including an autonomous Macedonia. But, as the Russian pressmeanwhile has been blessing Tito&apos;s idea of such an autonomous Macedonia withina Slav confederation, it is difficult to know how much importance should beattached to this denial. In any case, we certainly ought to keep our eyes open forany indications that the Soviet Government are devising any particular plans for using Bulgaria and the Macedonian question in order to establish Russianinfluence in the Balkans after the war. /O.
