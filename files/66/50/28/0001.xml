Results of Operations.1. German Cities.. Heavy attacks were made on a number of German cities during the period.The attack on Munich inflicted further damage on the old city, the main railway station and warehouses, and commercial property. In the attack on Essen 91large buildings in Krupps were seriously damaged. According to the interpreta-tion report &apos;&apos; not one of the larger buildings remains undamaged, while few ofthe smaller buildings have escaped.&quot; All five ball-bearing factories were hit inthe attack on Schweinf urt but only one suffered severe damage. The attack onFriedrichshafen was outstandingly successful and caused severe devastation tomany industrial premises (see print No. 1).[27540] - i
2. Precise targets in France.Several particularly successful attacks were carried out on precise targets in France. Prints Nos. 2 and 3 show the severe damage at the explosive works at St. Medard-en-Jalles. The aircraft repair plant at Tours was virtuallydestroyed (see print No. 4) and the aircraft assembly plant at Toulouse, whichwas heavily damaged early in April, was completely wrecked (see print No. 5).The Aulnat aircraft factory at Clermont-Ferrand and the German tank training centre at Mailly-le-Camp both suffered very severe damage (see prints Nos. and 7). On the night of 9th/10th May very accurate bombing completely destroyed the ball-bearing factory at Annecy (see print No. 8) and almostdevastated the Gnome and Rhone foundry and stamping plant at Gennevilliers(Paris) (see print No. 9).3. Ammunition dumps in France.Some successful attacks were made on ammunition dumps in France. 75 percent, of the storage units of the dump at Maintenon (the main dump of theG.A.F. in France) were heavily damaged on the 30th April/ 1st May, very many buildings of the ammunition filling installation at Sable-sur-Sarthe were seen on photographs taken on the 7th May, the day following the attack, tohave been damaged or destroyed and on the 7th/8th May the Bruz/St. Jacquesordnance depot suffered heavy damage. Prints Nos. 10 and 11 show the devasta-tion at the ammunition dumps at Chateaudun and Salbris caused bv the attacks on the 7th/8th May.4. Railway centres.More attacks, most of them successful, on railway centres were carried out during this period. Marshalling yards, carriage and wagon repair shops, tracksand rolling stock all suffered damage. Prints Nos. 12 and 13, showing resultsof raids on the marshalling yards at Aulnoye and La Chapelle, are examples ofthe concentrated bombing frequently achieved in such attacks. The importantrailway repair depot of Chambly, which was considered to be one of the most up-to-date of its kind in Europe, was heavily damaged on the lst/2nd May (seeprint No. 14).5. Results of Previous Raids.Prints Nos. 15-25 show damage caused in Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Kassel,Augsburg and Berlin in earlier attacks. 1C. Sea Mining.A highly successful minelaying operation in the Kiel Canal was carriedout by Mosquitoes on the 12th/13th May, when eleven mines were laid fromheights of between 300 and 400 feet. Shipping movements indicate that the canal has been closed as a result.The following successes are also reported : 19th February, 1944. The Dutch Zalbhaven (357 tons) was mined and sunk in the Elbe. (During 1944 the Swedish Press reported that the steamerTarnan (650 tons) was mined and sunk off the German Baltic coast).8th March, 1944.-The trawler Bernache (357 tons) was mined and sunk Iin the Bay of Biscay.9th March, 1944. The Danish cutter Ingrid was mined and sunk in theNorth Sea.26th iMarch, 1944.-The merchant vessel Lussak (1,586 tons) was mined and damaged off Morlaix.30th April, 1944. A 217-ton sailing vessel was mined and sunk offMoen. , \5th May, 1944. A Danish Press report states that the merchant vesselParaguay was mined and sunk in the Kattegat.The heavy minelaying effort in the Gulf of Danzig on the 9th/10th Aprilheld up normal traffic for fifteen days and closed.the ports of Konigsberg andPillau for thirteen days. It is estimated that some 40 per cent, of the totalpersonnel of the German navy is now engaged on the clearance and protectionof shipping routes and escort duties as the German minesweeping force has proved inadequate to deal with the offensive.Print No. 26 shows the areas in which mines have been laid from the1st January to the 30th April. &apos;A.

Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 279.20th May, 1944. fWAR CABINET.PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF BRITISH AIRLINES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.AT the request of the Civil Air Transport Committee of the War Cabinet,I have circulated (as W.P. (44) 268) a memorandum on the future of theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation.2. The memorandum shows, I think, that the case for preserving theCorporation as the single chosen instrument of the State for the operation of overseas air services and, indeed, for extending its scope is conclusive.3. I feel that my colleagues would wish to have the following brief com-ments on certain of the points raised by the Lord Privy Seal in his memorandumon the Private Ownership of British Airlines (W.P. (44) 263 (Revise)).Paragraphs 1 and 2.Though the war has inevitably led to a drastic curtailment of the EmpireAir Maii Scheme, successful efforts have been made to keep it in being in anattenuated form during the war so that, barring any fundamental change in policy, it can resume its pre-war scope on the return of peace. Letters which I.have received within the last day or two from the Prime Ministers of Australiaand New Zealand show that both countries are anxious to see the full Schemerestored as soon as practicable, if possible before the end of the war-It is true, as the Lord Privy Seal says, that the G.P.O. are free to placeair-mail contracts with other airline companies. But so long as the Empire AirMail Scheme is in existence under which B.O!A.C. receive, for fifteen years ofthe contract, an annual fixed sum calculated on the basis of the total mail likelyto be forthcoming for carriage by air, it would hardly be in the national interest that some of that mail for destinations covered by the Scheme should be diverted to private operators; the State would then be paying twice over for the carriage of mail on particular routes.So far as I am aware, South Africa has given no indication that she wishes to withdraw from the Scheme. She has, however, announced her intention ofentrusting all her external air services to a single chosen instrument owned and directed by the State. Similarly, Canada has announced that her choseninstrument for the operation of all her external air services will be transjTJajiada-Airways, which is also Government-owned.Paragraphs 3 and 4.I have set out in W.P. (44) 268 the reasons why our overseas air services should not be handed over to private interests who would enjoy, under the licensing system proposed by the Lord Privy Seal, monopoly rights on particularroutes. In any case, there is no statutory provision for a licensing system for our overseas air services, so that no action could now be taken on the lines he suggestswithout fresh legislation.Paragraph 5.Aeronautical science has certainly made great strides under the impetus ofwar, but as I have shown in W.P. (44) 268 the statement that with a return to private enterprise &apos;&apos; expansion of British overseas airline operations would besecured without subsidy&quot; requires substantial qualification.[27541]
