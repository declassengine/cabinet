Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 293.2nd June, 1944.WAR CABINET.BROADCASTS TO GERMANY.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.1. In W.P. (44) 283 the Foreign Secretary states : &quot; It is in my view impor-tant that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have some means of controlling the content of broadcasts to Germany put out over the B.B.C. on the subject of our future plans in regard to the occupation of that country.&quot; The Foreign Officeapparently does not realise that all broadcasts to Germany made through theB.B.C. have for the &quot;last three years been under the control of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment through the agency of the Political Warfare Executive. ,Further-more, it was at the instance of the Foreign Office that Mr. Ivone Kirkpatrick,formerly Counsellor in His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Berlin, was appointed Control-ler of all B.B.C. broadcasts to Europe. Mr. Kirkpatrick is now Deputy Director-General of the Political Warfare Executive, and it is only a few weeks ago thatthe Foreign Secretary asked me to consent to his returning to the Foreign office on the ground that he could find no other man with a better understanding ofGermany!2. The Foreign Secretary goes on to suggest that he should be &apos;&apos; authorisedto scrutinise the scripts of these broadcasts on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment from the political point of view before they are issued.&quot; But the Director-General of the Political Warfare Executive, who is a Deputy Under-Secretary ofState of the Foreign Office, never takes a decision on matters of high policy with-out referring to the Foreign Office. Moreover, the directive with which all german broadcasts given over the B.B.C. must conform is drawn up at a weekly meeting at which the Foreign Office is regularly represented.3. The Foreign Secretary proposes : &quot; If my colleagues agree that I should do this, the necessary machinery can easily and rapidly be set up to ensure thatcopies of the broadcasts are communicated to the Foreign Office in draft by theSupreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force.&quot; But as the draft scriptprepared by SHAEF, which is the occasion for the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper, wasin fact very properly submitted to the Foreign Secretary for scrutiny from thepoint of view of policy by the Political Warfare Executive (who received it fromSHAEF), what the Foreign Secretary is proposing is merely an unnecessaryduplication of present machinery.4. Some time ago, and only after much pressure, the busy American army officers in charge of &quot; psychological&quot; warfare accepted the principle that all their broadcast scripts should be submitted to the Political Warfare Executivefor checking before delivery. The Political Warfare Executive have effective machinery for checking them from all points of view, whereas the Foreign office have not. I see considerable danger in reopening this matter with the american army authorities, who would no doubt welcome any chance of having theirpropaganda utterances less thoroughly scrutinised than they now are.B, B.2nd June, 1944.Copy No. 36[27577]
