The Dominion-Provincial Health Conference is to be heldin May and the purpose of the meeting will be to consider the Draft HealthInsurance proposals now before a Parliamentary Committee.5. The first Social Credit Convention in Canada was held in Toronto andthe most important business of the Convention was the establishment of a NationalSocial Credit Association through which Social Credit candidates, pledged toestablish Social Credit principles, will contest all Federal constituencies wherethe electors desire to elect such a candidate. Mr. Solon Low has been electedPresident and it is thought that this will necessarily result in his resignation asProvincial Treasurer for Alberta.6.

In an attack later in the month by the same squadron against a convoy of three ships protected by three escort vessels, two of the escort vessels were left On fire. A Sunderland of 423 Squadron sighted a U-boat and attacked with depth charges. The first depth charge exploded on contact, severelydamaging the aircraft. The depth charge was seen to fall very close to theU-boat but as the rear gunner was rendered unconscious and the cameraunserviceable, proof of the results are not available. When the aircraft returnedto the scene of attack, however, the U-boat was not visible and a large patch of oil remained.AUSTRALIA.16. The dispute over the Australian censorship culminated in the develop-ment of a serious situation when the Sydney Sunday Telegraph and all SydneyMonday dailies were suppressed for refusing to accept the Censor&apos;s orders. these were to refrain from publishing in full (a) a reply by the Chairman of theAustralian Newspapers Association to the attack on him (and the newspapersgenerally) by the Minister of Information, (b) editorial comments on the actionof the censorship. The High Court of Australia granted an interim injunction,expiring on the 21st April, restraining the Commonwealth Government and thecensors from continuing to ban editorial matter dealing with the conflict and,when the parties to the dispute appeared on the 21st, the plaintiff newspapersdid not press for an additional injunction pending the action fixed for a dateearly in May.17. The United Australia Party passed a resolution declaring that, afterMr. W. M. Hughes had rejoined the Advisory War Council, he was no longer amember of the Party and that he consequently forfeited the Deputy leadership of the Party.

The Tasmanian Premier, Mr. Cosgrove, has announced that the Bill totransfer certain powers to the Commonwealth for the purposes of post-war reconstruction will be&apos;reintroduced into the State Parliament. This decisionfollowed a long discussion between the Federal Attorney-General, Dr. Evatt and members of the Legislative Council. *
19. Two State Elections, those of South Australia and Queensland, havebeen held, and the preliminary returns of the South Australian elections held onthe 29th April indicate that the Government (the Liberal Country Party) will bereturned with a reduced majority. The Minister for Education and Attorney-General, Mr. Jefferies, lost his seat. As a result of the Queensland Elections, theLabour Government, under the Premiership of Mr. Cooper, has been returnedwith a slightly reduced majority.20. The New South Wales State Parliament election will take place on the27th May. At present the Government (the Official Labour Party) has 56 members and the Official Opposition Democratic Party 14 members.21. An official Report just presented to the War Cabinet reveals a deficiency of at least 50,000 essential workers, and Mr. Forde, the Minister for the Army,in announcing this stated that the Government had decided to reduce theestablishment of the Military Forces by greatly restricting the monthly intake andto provide quicker discharges, so reducing the Army by 90,000 in the course of ayear. - After a further explanatory statement by. Mr. Forde the Report hasbeen well received, though there is criticism of the failure to transfer to primary and other essential industries workers in munition industries where the scale ofproduction is lessened.Service Activities.22. H.M. Australian Destroyer Quiberon was among the escort of theEastern Fleet which took part in the air attack on Sabang on the 19th.23. ELM. Australian Minesweeper Junee was commissioned on the 11thand H.M. Australian Frigate Diamagtina was launched on the 6th.24. General Sir Thomas Blarney, G.B.E., C.M.G., D.S.O., arrived in london at the end of the month for the meetings of Dominion Prime Ministers. during his absence from Australia General Blamey&apos;s powers as Commander-in-Chiefwere delegated to the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant-General J. Northcott,C.B., M.V.O.25. By the 22nd April, 15,079 army personnel had been released to ruralindustry out of the 20,000 which it was decided to make available.26. Strength of United States forces in the South-West Pacific area onthe 28th March, the last date for which figures are at present available, was421,677, including 88,023 of the Air Corps.NEW ZEALAND.Service Activities.27. Lieutenant-General E. Puttick, C.B., D.S.O., arrived in London at theend of the month for the meetings of Dominion Prime Ministers.&quot;28. Reports from the South-West Pacific indicate that there is a generalslackening of Japanese air activity in the area, and the Royal New Zealand AirForce has lately been reduced to routine duties with occasional attacks on Rabaul.29. Sufficient aircraft have now been delivered to New Zealand to equipcompletely the six Bomber Reconnaissance Squadrons with Ventura in place ofHudson aircraft.30. About half the required number of Corsair aircraft have been delivered in New Zealand to re-equip the ten Fighter Squadrons from war hawks.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.31. The Union Parliament which has been sitting since January is not expected to rise before the end of May as important measures are still to be debated; among which is the Fishing Industry Development Bill which has comeback from the Select Committee in an amended form, but still contains provisionfor the establishment of a State Corporation.32. Dr. Malan, as leader of the Opposition, in a speech in Western Cape hasinaugurated a campaign to present the Nationalist party as the sole guardianof white supremacy in South Africa.[27505] B .2
33. Speaking at the Easter Conference of the Trades and Labour Council,field-Marshal Smuts said that South Africa was now on the &quot; great divide &quot; hitherto mainly an agricultural country, there was no doubt that South Africanow was destined to become largely an industrial one. The time has come to draft a new labour code, the present one not being adequate.34. Public attention has centred on the announcement by the Minister of-Welfare and Demobilisation, Mr. Lawrence, on the Government plans to reabsorbSouth Africa&apos;s volunteers in civil life, as discharged or when demobilised at theend of the war. The general policy of re-employment is to place 40- per cent, ofthe total in suitable jobs and the whole scheme will be carried out by an executive board, together with an Advisory Council, which will report to theDirector-General.35. During a debate at the beginning of April on the Indian question inSouth Africa, the Minister of the Interior, Mr. Clarkson, strongly criticised three members of the Dominion party and made &quot; a last appeal for help and assistance and not an attitude of continual hostility.&quot; Subsequently at a meeting on the18th April between Field-Marshal Smuts, Senator Clarkson, European repre-sentatives from Natal and representatives of the Natal Indian Congress, it was unanimously agreed that legislation should be immediately introduced into theNatal Provincial Council to provide for a joint board of five, consisting of twoEuropeans and two Indians with a European chairman whose function it will beto license the occupation of dwellings in Natal Municipal areas. On the passingof this legislation the &quot; Pegging &quot; Act will be drawn by proclamation. TheAgreement has been welcomed as a sensible compromise by the pro-Governmentpress, while the Dominion party fear that it has cut the ground from under theirfeet. The Organ of the Natal Indian Congress says that the Pegging Act has aroused resentment in India, and the Durban City Council has passed a resolution of protest against the Governments decision to supersede the Pegging Act. it remains to be seen how the situation will ultimately develop.NEWFOUNDLAND.36. Since the statement of policy&apos;in regard to the future of Newfoundlandwas made in the House of Commons on the 2nd December the Secretary of state has been in communication with the Newfoundland Government as to the mostsuitable form of machinery which might be set up, after the war in Europe ends,for enabling the people of Newfoundland to review the position and giveexpression to their wishes. Arrangements have now been made for three membersof the Commission of Government to visit this country in the near future forfurther discussion on the subject.37. The financial year ended on the 31st March last produced a surplus ofabout $5,634,000, revenue amounting to a record figure of 128,552,000, whichmay be compared with the figure of about $12,000,000 just before the war. Theestimates for 1944-45 provide for a revenue of $24,424,000 and expenditure of124,255,800 giving a surplus of $168,800. .Of the expenditure about $5,500,000is attributable to special wartime services and reconstruction expenditure mainly of a capital nature. In the Budget speech the Commissioner for Finance pointedout that though a surplus of about $16,000,000 had been accumulated since thewar, this would, in fact, only suffice to meet a part, and not the major part, of theexpenditure on resettlement, reconstruction and development which would haveto be faced after the war,EIRE. .    &apos;38. On the 6th April it was officially announced by the Postmaster-general that, as part of the general measures to prevent leakage of vital informationthrough Ireland, the public telephone service between Great Britain and all partsof Ireland would be withdrawn immediately. The public telegraph service wouldbe maintained subject to strict censorship. The ban on the export of local news-papers to Ireland and other countries has also been put into force.39. Speaking at a meeting in Killarney on the 1st April, General Mulcahysaid that the episode of the American note showed that the spirit of determination to defend their sovereignty and territory had filled all classes in the country. Theepisode demonstrated that the spirit of freedom and independence fostered and
developed out of the experiences of the last war in the countries of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations was what it claimed to be and that they were truly a group of countries regarding each other as co-equal in status in every way.40. Mr. de Valera has sent messages to the United States, United Kingdomand German Governments urging action to save Rome from destruction. the messages said that Mr. de Valera considered it his duty to express the deepconcern which 300 million Roman Catholics throughout the world are sharing atthe danger threatening Rome and at the absence of any measures by the belligerentPowers to assure its safety. The destruction of this Holy City in which the greatcentral temples of Catholic religion, the great seminaries and libraries ofChristian faith are situated, would mean a major calamity for the human race.41. The German Government replied that Germany had already takenmeasures to demilitarise Rome and said that the responsibility for its destructionwould rest exclusively with the British and the Americans. &quot;The Reich Govern-ment must, therefore, leave it to the Irish Premier to address himself to the Britishand United States Governments and to point out to them once more that Rome isdemilitarised.&quot;42. The United States Governments reply stated that the american military authorities in Italy have tried scrupulously often at considerablesacrifice to spare religious and cultural monuments and they would continue todo so. It recalled that tfhe Germans were using to the limit of its capacity the communication network and other facilities of Rome to further a purely german military operation.  The fate of Rome rests with the German Government.43. The United Kingdom Government has. not returned any reply toMr. de Valera&apos;s communication.44. Drastic cuts in supplies were announced by the Eire Department ofSupplies on the 11th April. The Great Southern Railway has also announceddrastic cuts in its passenger train service. Passenger trains as from the24th April will run only on two days a week on branch and main lines. Goodstrains will operate only on four days a week and eleven branch lines will be closed.The number of passengers will be limited and dining cars will cease to run.45. Speaking in the Dail, Mr. Lemass, Minister for Industries and Com-merce, said that these transport cuts were only the first steps arising from the diminution of coal supplies. He mentioned&quot; that further electricity restrictions were coming into force, including a 15 per cent, cut in the use of electrical power by industries, a further decrease of train services and another cut of 15 per cent,in electricity for cooking services.46. These restrictions follow the notification made to the Eire authorities at the end of- March that at an early date thereafter it would be necessarytemporarily to reduce the supply of coal to Eire from about 21,000 to 10,000 tons per week.  This reduction came into force towards the end of the month.   -47. On the 13th April it was officially announced in London that steamshipservices between Britain and Ireland were to be reduced drastically as from the24th April in view of the reduction of passenger traffic between the two countriesfollowing the travel restriction announced in March. There was also to be areduction of all merchandise and live-stock steamship sailings.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.48. The Japanese incursion into Manipur has provided the enemy withpropaganda material, of which they have made the fullest use in their broadcaststo India. Nevertheless, although it has caused some uneasiness, it has failed tocreate anything approaching to panic even in the forward areas of Assam andno unfavourable repercussions have occurred within India.49. There is little to report on the political scene generally. Some attention has been paid to appeals made by Congress spokesmen in Assam and in theUnited Provinces for a closing of the ranks in face of the Japanese menace, butchiefly as an occasion for renewed demands for the release of the Congress leaders.There has been an interesting trial of strength in the Punjab between Mr. Jinnah
and the Premier, Khizar Hayat Khan, who, though an adherent of the moslem league, heads a &apos;&apos; Unionist&apos;&apos; Ministry, containing representatives of the Hindusand Sikhs as well as a majority of Moslems. Mr. Jinnah has for some time been pressing the Premier to drop the Unionist label and give undivided allegiance to the Moslem League; so far he has failed to impose his will on the Premier andhis leverage has been weakened by the recent dismissal from the Ministry of theMinister (the son of the late Premier), who was the principal adherent of the moslem League. Mr. Jinnah&apos;s interference, if persisted in, may have anunsettling effect on what has been the most stable and successful of the provincial governments set up in 1937.50. Mr. Gandhi &apos;s health has recently caused anxiety. An attack of malarialeft him in a Aveak state, and low blood pressure suggested the risk of coronarythrombosis.51. The announcement that proposals had been made by the South african government involving the withdrawal of the Pegging Act in its application to indians in Durban is said to have been received in India with relief mingled withscepticism as to any real change of heart in South Africa.External and Frontier Relations.52. A afghanistan. In the Southern Province the Afghan Government havehad some trouble with a turbulent tribal leader named Mazarak, who was reportedto have invited the Faqir of Ipi to assist the tribes against the Afghan Govern-ment. The garrison of the Southern Province was strongly reinforced by troops from Kabul and some aircraft were moved to the vicinity of the affected area. Itwas reported that the Afghan Government forces had attacked Mazarak on the22nd April and had driven him with a greatly reduced following into the hills.The Afghan Foreign Minister informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister that the AfghanGovernment felt confident of being able to deal with Mazarak provided that he did not receive support from tribesmen on the Indian side of the border, and he asked that the Government of India would take steps to prevent any concentra-tion of the Waziristan tribes against the Afghan Government. The Afghan WarMinister went to Gardez, where he hoped to use his influence to pacify the areaaffected.53. Drastic action on the part of the Government to keep down pricesappeared to be fairly successful and there was no change in the economic situation.54. The Italian Minister, Signor Quaroni, has been appointed as Italianrepresentative in Moscow and expected to leave Kabul about the end of the month.His Majesty&apos;s Minister and, his American colleague have expressed doubts as tothe wisdom of this appointment from the point of view of British and american interests. Anzillotti, the Italian Secretary, left Kabul to return to Italy on the18th April. The Legation will be left in charge of the archivist pending adecision as to its closure.55. North-West Frontier Province. In Waziristan the Faqir of Ipi left the area where he had been sheltering, apparently in consequence of the bombing of a village; his whereabouts at the end of April were unknown. Effective air and artillery action was taken against villages known to have harboured alashkar which attacked a Scout post about the middle of the month; and air action was also taken in an area in which two sheels were fired on another Scoutpost about the same time. Responsible tribal opinion remained definitely opposedto providing support for the Faqir against Government, but the Afghan Govern-ment&apos;s threat of air action against supporters of Mazarak caused some excitementon the British side of the frontier. Strong political pressure was brought to bearon the tribesmen, in response to the Afghan Government&apos;s request, and at the endof the month the tribesmen had not shown signs of crossing the border intoAfghanistan in any numbers.56. Nepal. In reply to his request that His Majesty&apos;s Minister,Lieutenant-Colonel Betham, should be permitted to receive a Nepalese decorationon his retirement,&apos; it was necessary to inform the Maharaja that the rule against such awards could not be waived. It is hoped, however, that the Maharaja&apos;sdisappointment over this decision may have been mitigated to some extent by theaward of a Knighthood of the British Empire to Colonel Betham before he left-Katmandu. Lieutenant-Colonel Falconer took over charge of His Majesty&apos;sLegation on the 24th April. ; j\
57. Persian Gulf. -Some adverse comments have been expressed on thefighting on the Assam front.58. The United States Minister at Bagdad, who recently paid a visit toBahrein and Koweit, has stated his high appreciation of the courtesies extendedto him by the British Political Agents at those places, and of the excellent workwhich they are doing in support of the joint war effort.59. The Sultan of Muscat has been in Cairo and has had an interview withNahas Pasha, the Egyptian Premier.  He has now gone to Palestine.60. In Bahrein a number of American nationals was recently imported forthe construction of a new Refinery. These Americans are reported to be an unrulyset&apos;of men, and the question of their control may present&quot;some difficulty. ThePolitical Agent has appointed eight special constables, four of. whom areAmericans, to deal with them. The presence of this increased number of americans in Bahrein has caused the Americans to renew their proposal for the appointmentof an American Consul there. The matter was discussed in London withMr. Wallace Murray of the State Department and the objections seen to such an appointment were explained to him. It is hoped that the State Department willas the result be content with the alternative suggested, namely, that the AmericanConsul to be appointed to Dhahran on the mainland should look after american interests in Bahrein.61. Sinkiang. -The Tass Agency published the Russian version of the incident referred to in last month&apos;s Summary in which, according to the Chinese,troops operating against bandits in Chinese territory were attacked by Sovietaircraft. According to this version. Chinese troops, supported by Chineseaircraft, had crossed the border of Outer Mongolia in pursuit of refugees whomthe Chinese wished to transfer from the frontier to the south of the Province andthe Mongolian Republic, regarding this as an act of aggression, was prepared to seek Soviet assistance under the Soviet-Mongolian Treaty of 1936. This was alsothe line taken by the Soviet Ambassador when the matter was taken up with himby the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Urumchihas no doubt that Chinese troops did cross the frontier. There has been someunrest in the North of the Province, which is attributed to resentment among the tribesmen at the influx of Chinese colonists and preparations for road-building.-62. Tibet. -The Tibetan Government were reported to take a ratherapathetic attitude towards the constant stream of Chinese propaganda designedto give the impression that Tibet is merely a Province of China. The Govern-ment of India have expressed the view that this attitude is a dangerous one for the Tibetans, in view of possible Chinese designs after the war, and have proposed that Sir Basil Gould, the Political Officer, Sikkim, who carried great-prestige in Tibet, should visit Lhasa this summer to discuss the matter withthe Tibetan Government. He would also explain to the Tibetans the measuresbeing taken by the Government of India to vindicate the McMahon Line, thefrontier line agreed with the Tibetans in 1914. Of recent years, Tibetanofficials have encroached on territory well to the south of this line.63. The Tibetans, with whom relations remain very friendly, have decidedto set up an English School and have asked for an English master for it.Finance.64. Indian Budget. The Legislative Assembly declined to consider theFinance Bill embodying the Government&apos;s taxation proposals (see report for february), but they were passed into law by the procedure of certification. on one point the proposed enhancement of railway passenger fares the Govern -ment felt obliged to give way in face of violent criticism, both in theAssembly and from the public. The final result is that new measures designedto absorb some  60 million of purchasing power (as against the original 69 million) will have effect in 1944-45.65. Silver. Reference was made in the report for January to the factthat the Americans had agreed in principle to lend 100 million ounces of silverfor sale as an anti-inflationary measure. Negotiations on outstanding pointshave since been taken place, and it has proved necessary for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to assume the responsibility for replacing the silver after the warif, for any reason, the Government of India fail in their obligation to do so.No progress has been made in regard to the separate demand for coinage silver.
Meanwhile, prices in the Bombay bullion market have risen to new record levelsas a result of nervousness occasioned by the Japanese incursion into North-EastIndia.Economic and Social.66. Wheat. This year&apos;s wheat crop promised very well in the early stages.Unseasonable rains at harvest time have caused considerable damage to the crop with the result that the estimates show a tonnage much short of last year&apos;sharvest which, however, was a record one. The outturn according to the forecastshould be slightly below average and there is in consequence a considerablegap between the supplies likely to be made available by the producing areas andthe requirements of the wheat-eating areas (mainly the large cities) elsewhere.The statistical shortage is even more acute when account is taken of this year&apos;sheavy defence requirements.67. Groundnuts. This year the Government of India found some difficultyin reconciling the demands of the Ministry of Food for Indian groundnuts forexport with the numerous undertakings they had given in regard to the exportof food from India, In direct discussion between the Ministry of Food&apos;representative and the Department concerned in Delhi, however, a settlementhas been effected mutually satisfactory to both parties.68. Shellac. Shellac, largely used as a waterproof coating for munitions,became the subject of a joint buying arrangement in 1942, when the Ministryof Supply sent a representative to India who bought on the spot, on behalf ofthe United Kingdom and United States Governments., Recently, the UnitedStates Government have decided to revert to private purchase and there is some anxiety as to the result. There is a considerable civil demand in America whichhas been starved during the period of Government purchase.69. Proposed large-scale production of artificial fertilisers. The Govern-ment of India have been making enquiries in the United States and in theUnited Kingdom on the possibilities of establishing artificial fertiliser plants in India to assist the Grow More Food campaign. Establishment, with financial help from Central or Provincial Governments, of a number of plants to produce350,000 tons per annum, of ammonium sulphate is envisaged within the next two years. Arrangements are now being made to examine the matter on the spot by sending out to India a number of United Kingdom experts representingtha British Plant Manufacturers and Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd.,who would collaborate in the design and running in of the plants and the trainingof Indian operatives. If these arrangements have a successful outcome, thereshould be opened up a valuable outlet for British products and British enterprise.Equipment for the Indian Railways.70. (i) Metre Gauge. The Government of India recently reported thatthe demands placed, and the delivery programme arranged, for metre gaugelocomotives and wagons will be adequate for their requirements.(ii) Broad Gauge. The number of broad gauge locomotives alreadydefinitely being provided from the United States and Canada is 605. Of this number, 185 will have been shipped by May 1944. Delivery of a further 255 isexpected&apos;to be completed by the end of 1944, and the remaining 165 have been planned for delivery during January-August 1945.71. Considerable quantities of wagon components are coming forwardsteadily from America and this country for India&apos;s construction programmeof 25,650 broad gauge wagons. Production capacity has also been found inAmerica for the Government of India&apos;s urgent demand for 5,000 broad gaugewagons required to balance a short-fall in their indigenous production this year.72. The Government of India have recently telegraphed, however, that,in addition to the foregoing supplies, they require to be delivered in 1945 upto 361 broad gauge locomotives and 24,700 broad gauge wagons, in order toenable the military load expected in 1945 to be carried and civil traffic to be restored to a level essential for the maintenance of the economy of the country.The precise figure of these requirements depends on military plans and on theextent to which it is found possible to increase the amount of coastwise shipping .available in order to relieve the railways, but.the Government of India estimate that even if shipping were restored to the pre-war level no less than 196 broadgauge locomotives and 14,300 broad wagons would still be required.    ine
problem of the supply of coastwise shipping is now being considered by theMinistry of War Transport. Enquiries are also proceeding as to the possibilityof obtaining additional locomotives and wagons from the United States and canada. It is understood that it is very unlikely that a portion of the require-ments could be produced in the United Kingdom in 1945.73. The Bombay Disaster. On the 14th April there was an explosion onboard a ship loaded with ammunition in the Victoria Dock, Bombay. This set fire to several other ships and shortly afterwards there was a second and even more severeexplosion. Fires broke out in the area of Victoria Dock and spread to Prince&apos;sDock and the adjoining part of the city. The fires were not brought under controluntil three days later. In all, 366 people were killed and 1,040 injured.Colonel Sadler, General Manager of Docks and Railways in Bombay, was amongthe killed. In addition, several thousands of people were rendered homeless.There was, however, no panic, and the exodus from the city by rail was only 10 percent, in excess of normal traffic.74. Severe damage was caused by the disaster. Prince&apos;s and Victoria Docksare out of action. All buildings in or near these docks have been destroyed, alsonearly all the fire-fighting equipment and salvage stores and a large number ofcranes. In addition, a substantial quantity of grain was destroyed. Fourteenmerchant ships were total losses and six damaged (most of these being employedon the Indian coast), and the Victoria and Prince&apos;s Docks were blocked bywreckage. Two dredgers were included in the smaller ships lost. AlexandraDock, the Merewether and Hughes dry docks, and the oil installations wereundamaged.75. Everything is being done to restore the port to its full working capacity.The Army has taken over the land area near the Victoria and Prince&apos;s Docks, andthe Navy the basins, for restoration and salvage. It is estimated that Prince&apos;sDock should be working to near capacity in two to three months. The speed atwhich Victoria Dock can be repaired depends largely on the amount of salvageequipment available. The Government of India have asked His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to help them in providing salvage gear (which it is believed can befound by the Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet) and in replacing the cranes and food-grains lost.76. A Commission of Enquiry has been set up to ascertain the cause of the disaster. It consists of the Chief Justice of Bombay, an Indian retired judge anda Rear-Admiral, R.N., assisted by five technical assessors. The Commission willmake its report to the Government of India.77. Bengal Health Situation. Cholera mortality is now normal for this time of year. Smallpox, however, is still increasing. During the month of Aprilnearly 2 million people were inoculated against cholera and nearly 3 millionvaccinated. Doctors are now being recruited in adequate numbers as a result ofthe improved terms offered by the Government of Bengal. There is no difficultyin obtaining necessary drugs.78. Civil emergency hospitals have been constructed to take over from thetented military hospitals which were due to be withdrawn at the end of April.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.79. Royal Indian Navy. Owing to the approaching advent of the monsoonand resulting bad weather in the Bay of Bengal our light coastal forces have ceased operating on the Arakan coast and have been withdrawn to Indian portsfor refitting.Military.80. Italy. Indian troops have been in the line throughout the month, butthere has been nothing of particular interest to report.81. North-West Frontier. There has been some increase in hostile activity in two areas of Waziristan caused by the Faqir of Ipi, but the situation is not considered critical and so far it has been unnecessary to move troops. Airproscription of the affected areas continues.82. Burma, Ara&amp;aw-Both tunnels on the road Maungdaw-Buthidaungwere captured early in the month.   Since then fighting has continued and our[27505] c
troops have made slight advances east and west of the Mayu range and in theButhidaung area. The enemy continue to make strong local counter-attacks inattempts to pin down our forces.83. Kaladan. Here activity has moved to the neighbourhood of Paletwa,where some small bodies of the enemy are being engaged by our forces.84. Imphal Area. The enemy hoped to isolate or cut off our troops in theTiddim area. This failed and the latter withdrew successfully on Imphal. since then enemy attempts to advance along the Tiddim-Imphal and Tamu-Palel roads and to debouch on to the plain south and south-west of Imphal have been held. TheJapanese, however, have been concentrating in this area and an attempt to pushthrough to Imphal is anticipated and has been prepared for. Heavy fighting tookplace to the north and north-east of Imphal, with positions changing hands. Theenemy have now been driven back and our troops are advancing north-east towardsUkhrul, while to the north and north-west we are also making progress. over ,000 enemy dead have been counted in this area since operations began.Undoubtedly, there were many more which did not come into our hands.85. Kohima-Bimapur. The enemy early in the month reached Kohima,cutting the road on both sides of it, and penetrated the southern outskirts, fromwhich they were later ejected. Considerable numbers also by-passed Kohima andadvanced west and north-west on either side of the road to Dimapur, aiming ateventually cutting the railway. Further large bodies moved northwards east ofKohima in the direction of Mokokchung, presumably with the object of cuttingthe railway east of Jorhat. Strong British reinforcements were moved up toDimapur and these cleared the road to Kohima and relieved the garrison. this had the effect of drawing back the enemy forces which had by-passed Kohima fora further assault on the town. These forces are now being attacked by freshBritish troops from Dimapur, and it is anticipated the situation will soon be cleared up. Meantime, the enemy movement towards Mokokchung has ceased andthese forces are being engaged by long-range penetration group columns whichhave have moved east and north-east from Dimapur.86. Enemy man-power in both the Imphal and Kohima areas is beingsteadily reduced, many units having lost 50 per cent, of their effectives, and their supply situation is worsening.87. Huhawng Valley-North Burma. General Stilwell&apos;s Chinese troops have made progress in the Mogaung Valley and are now within 16 miles ofKamaing. The American Ranger Group have reached an area 50 miles north-west of Myitkyina, while our troops and levies from Fort Hertz are between 30 and40 miles north of Myitkyina.88. Our Long-Range Penetration Groups have operated throughout themonth in the general areas round Katha and Bhamo, interrupting rail and roadcommunications, destroying dumps of stores and ammunition and ambushingJapanese columns. In all encounters enemy casualties are invariably muchheavier than ours, and a growing number of Japanese troops are being contained.89. Air. Air activity has been on an increased scale throughout the month.The air situation on the Imphal front is satisfactory and we have complete air superiority over Upper Burma. The main effort has been directed to the supportof the ground troops and maintenance by air. Bombing of enemy installations and targets in rear has been continued and routine patrols have been flown as heretofore.90. The enemy has for the most part only made small and ineffective raids against objectives in the Imphal area and his troops may be said to be operatingvirtually without air support.91. General: Bombay Explosion. The explosion and fire in the dock area will undoubtedly reduce capacity, but this reduction will be less serious than atfirst feared.92. Morale. The Japanese advance on the Chindwin front has caused considerable interest, but has had no adverse effect on army morale in general.14th Army morale stands high and the troops in Imphal are in good heart despitewithdrawals.93. Reactions to stories of Japanese atrocities are favourable, but notpronounced, especially among Indian troops. Most service personnel alreadyknew or guessed at the truth.
94.   First reactions to pay increases to Indian troops are not yet available.95. Fost-war resettlement. The resettlement in civil life in India ofdemobilised personnel from the three fighting services, including the W.A.C.(India), will be the primary concern of the &quot; Directorate of Resettlement,&quot; anew organisation set up under the Directorate-General of Welfare, education and Resettlement, G.H.Q., India. The Directorate of Resettlement is to representthe interests of the defence services in the employment exchanges. It is to bereferred to in matters relating to all vocational training for British and Indianpersonnel who require further training to suit them for civilian occupations.Part of its functions is to ensure that ex-Service personnel obtain their full shareof employment in any reconstruction plans and development projects by acting asliaison between G.H.Q. (I.) and the Government of India, the provincial governments, and the Indian States.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Occvspied Burma.96. Evidence is accumulating which tends to show that the Japanese aredisliked in Burma, especially by the higher ranks of former British government officials, and that in the majority of cases in which the latter work for the puppetGovernment they do so either under orders or owing to the need of supportingtheir families.97. Ba Maw&apos;s Budget Estimates are: Income, Rs. 69 million; andExpenditure, Rs. 281 million. The total deficit since August 1943 now amountsto Rs. 358 million.General.98. Sir J. Wise, one of the Governors Counsellors, is to be appointedLiaison Officer with the Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia.99. Arrangements have been made for work on civil supplies requirementson reoccupation to be carried on in close collaboration between the Government of burma and the military Civil Affairs Staff.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &apos;&apos; Colonial Governors &apos;&apos; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.Ceylon.100. In my report for last month I referred to the serious danger of an interruption in Ceylon&apos;s rice supplies due to the fact that the rice purchased bythe Ministry of Food in Egypt was coming forward much more slowly than hadbeen hoped. In view of the danger of a temporary exhaustion of Ceylon&apos;s ricestocks, the Government of India were asked, through the Secretary of Statefor India, if they could make a temporary loan of 5,000 tons of rice to Ceylonto be repaid from later arrivals of Egyptian rice. The Government of Indiaagreed to make this loan and a shipment of over 4,000 tons arrived in the island in the latter part of April. This help from India was of the greatest value in averting what might otherwise have been a serious crisis.101. Supplies of rice to meet Ceylon&apos;s minimum import requirement of10,000 tons a month for the remainder of the year have now been programmedpartly from Egypt and partly irom Brazil. The Brazilian supplies are requiredto cover the Island&apos;s requirements during the latter half of this year after the[27505] c 2
purchases from the current season&apos;s Egyptian rice crop have been exhausted and before next season&apos;s crop becomes available. The Government of Australia havegenerously agreed to contribute 6,000 tons of rice to Ceylon. This will be setoff against the shipments which are having to be made from Brazil.East Africa.102. I received a telegram from East Africa in the middle of Aprilreporting an improvement in the food situation there as a result of satisfactorycrop prospects. In consequence it has been possible to reduce the total require-ment of imported cereals for the period up to September of this year from130,000 tons to 116,000 tons. A still greater reduction could have been madebut for the fact that the East African authorities strongly recommended thatthey be allowed to carry forward approximately 22,000 tons as a reserve stock.In view of the fact that the holding of such a reserve stock may be the means,by maintaining confidence among producers in East Africa, of saving largervolume of imports which would otherwise be required later, the supply and shipping authorities have agreed to a programme of imports providing for thiscarry-over.Production.Groundnut Prices.103. Northern Nigeria. In order to help meet the great and growingshortage of edible oils and fats, it has been decided to raise the producers&apos; price for 1944-45 by 50 per cent, to  12 per ton, a level where possible inflationaryeffects on the internal economy of the territory caused the local Government some concern.104. Gambia. The 1944-45 price has similarly been raised to  12 perton, not so much to increase local production as to facilitate the flow of producefrom surrounding French territory and to attract &quot; strange farmers &quot; from there.Assistance to Trinidad Sugar Industry.105. As a contribution towards the rehabilitation of the industry whichis passing through a difficult phase, owing principally to the influx of Americanmoney and the disruption of the labour market through the provision of well-paid work in connection with the United States bases, and at the same time toensure the planting of cane for reaping in 1946 to the greatest extent possible,it has been decided that the bonus of $40 an acre which was instituted by theGovernment of Trinidad during the 1943 planting season should be continue during the 1944 season and that the whole cost involved, estimated to amount to$400,000, should be from funds to be provided by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Milling Industry in Palestine.106. The flour milling industry in Palestine, which relies on the middle east for its supplies of grain, has for some time been working under severedifficulties owing to the dirty condition of the grain on its arrival at the mills.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.107. The attitude of the population generally to the war remained unchanged, and its interest in it was outweighed by a resurgence of politicalfeeling, caused by fears of a renewed outbreak of terrorism and speculation asto the future of Palestine.108. The Arabs professed horror and alarm at the terrorist activities of jewish illegal organisations, and their Press indulged in a self-righteous casti-gation of Jewish lawlessness. They followed developments with keen interest,and closely watched the effect of the curfew and other security measures, which many said were not drastic enough.109. There was speculation as to His Majesty&apos;s Governments intentionsregarding the White Paper policy, and the Arabs were apprehensive lest Zionistpressure and propaganda abroad might lead to its abandonment.110. Terrorist activities of the Irgun Zvai Leumi and the Stern Groupcontinued and caused alarm among the community. Responsible leaders however,political and religious, while liberal in their condemnatory pronouncements andexpressions of disapproval, gave no real lead in active co-operation with the police.
Political leaders themselves were divided as to what course they should take,and were more exercised by the need to avoid serious rifts within the community(whose cohesion would be threatened by counter-terrorist action) than by that ofeliminating terrorism. There were signs, however, that certain responsible quarterswere going as far as they dared sub rosa towards bringing the illegal organisations to heel.111. Internal Jewish politics were somewhat over-shadowecl by the recentcampaign of terrorism and the Governments counter-measures. The Histadruthsucceeded in securing, by a majority, a resolution in support of the Biltmoreprogramme before the International Trade Union Congress.112. Police action against terrorism continued. Eighty-one persons, mostlybelonging to the Irgun, were rounded up and detained under the emergency regulations. In two recent instances, the Police received useful informationanonymously from the public. Police casualties during the month were oneSergeant killed, one Inspector and three Constables wounded, but not seriously,whilst a determined but unsuccessful attempt was made on the life of a DeputySuperintendent.Aden Protectorate.113. The Protectorate has suffered last year and this year from failure ofthe normal rainfall which has resulted in a shortage of food and latterly in some parts of the Protectorate in conditions of famine. The district which has sufferedmost severely is the Hadramaut valley in the interior of the eastern part of the protectorate. The inhabitants of this part of the country have for many years been largely dependent upon remittances amounting to about  600,000 a year from Malaya and Java, where many members of Hadrami families are settled and where they own considerable property. These remittances have ceased asa result of the Japanese occupation of those countries, and the situation has been further aggravated by the cessation of normal food imports from India. In spiteof remedial measures taken locally, the position deteriorated to such an extent that the Governor of Aden was compelled early in March this year to appealto the Secretary of State for financial assistance to deal with the problem. Heestimated his immediate requirements at  318,000 to be spent on assistance in kind to cultivators, on the construction of two barrages for the conservation anddistribution of water, for the purchase of irrigation pumps, for the free issueof rations, for the chartering of a vessel to deliver the supplies to the nearestport and other miscellaneous expenses. In view of the gravity of the situation the Governor&apos;s request for funds was approved by the Secretary of State in fulland with the least possible delay.114. At the same time the Governor posted a Senior Political Officer to theHadramaut valley as a Famine Relief Commissioner to organise and administer the social and agricultural relief schemes with the assistance of such administra-tive, medical and, agricultural staff as could be made available.115. Since then the main problem has been one of transport, which hasseriously impeded famine relief work. There has been a heavy mortality amongthe local camels owing to the lack of grazing, and local motor transport, which isold and numerically inadequate, has failed owing to bad tracks and gradientsof the few roads existing in this mountainous country. The Governor has conse-quently appealed for assistance from the Royal Air Force and the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, Middle East, has made available Wellington aircraft fromhis Command, which the Governor reports to be doing wonderful work in flyinggrain into the Hadramaut valley.116. Reports have appeared in the London Press stating that the R.A.F.has assisted by arranging for supplies of grain amounting to 30 tons daily to-be dropped in the Hadramaut and that a relief commission has been flown fromAden to give assistance on the spot. Further information from the Governorregarding these measures is awaited.Mauritius. :117. The edge of a cyclone struck Mauritius during the week ending the15th April, causing considerable damage to crops. It is estimated, at present that10-15 per cent, of the sugar-cane crop and 60-70 per cent, of the maize crop hasbeen lost.   There was slight damage to buildings but no loss of life.
Fiji: Dispute in the sugar industry (see paragraphs 120 and 121 of Report for march).118. After consultations in this country, Professor Shephard left for Fijion the 20th April to conduct his enquiry into the Fiji sugar industry. Boththe company and the cane growers have expressed their intention of co-operating with him in the carrying out of his investigation.119. Meanwhile, bad weather has temporarily prevented the resumption ofcane planting, but the Governor is confident that as soon as conditions permit,full-scale planting of cane will be resumed.Cyprus.120. Following a strike at a local factory, a series of bomb outrages, none of which caused personal injuries, occurred, in Limassol, arousing considerableapprehension among the law-abiding townspeople. To assist the regular police in the protection of life and. property the Government called up about 100 special constables, including 39 trade unionists. Of these 37, of whom 23 were trade unionists, after being enrolled, absented themselves from duty without leave andwere punished by imprisonment for periods varying from one to nine days. Bythe 15th April it was found possible to discharge all the special constables except17, who remained voluntarily at duty. This incident led to allegations ofpolice discrimination against trade unionists, which were, however, shown to be without foundation.Falkland Islands.121. A fire completely destroyed the Town Hall at Port Stanley, in whicha number of Government departments, including the Post Office, Censorship andPublic Works Departments, were accommodated, as well as the Museum andpublic library. It is feared that there has been considerable loss of public records.There were no casualties.   An enquiry has found, that the fire was accidental.West Indies.122. A short report of the outcome of the West Indian&apos; Conference,mentioned in the report for March, has been received. The Conference appearsto have been successful and its recommendations for the improvement of nutrition,the expansion of food production and fisheries, &amp;c, will now be considered bythe Governments of the West Indian Colonies and United States territories concerned.123. The Empire Parliamentary Association Delegation, mentioned in thereport for February, has completed its tour of the West Indies and neighbouringColonies and has now returned to this country.Jamaica Shipping Strike.124. The trouble on the Kingston water-front, which started on the15th March, was due to disputes over conditions of work. This was settled bythe 21st March, but matters were made difficult for Government by theirresponsible attitude adopted by Bustamante, the Labour leader.125. Trouble broke out again on the 16th April in spite of the settlement.Even where work was not stopped it was deliberately slowed down to such an extent that the cost of handling ships was increased by over 100 per cent. TheGovernor reported that the demands made by the strikers were of a trivial nature,and were mere pretexts to slow down work and interfere with the wharf ownersin the management of their business; and that part of the procedure was probably due to an unhealthy spirit of political competition by Bustamante in an endeavourto maintain his political prestige. i126. To meet the situation ships were diverted as far as possible to out-ports, and naval and military assistance was obtained. If the trouble continued the Governor contemplated calling for volunteer labour.127. The Ministry of War Transport takes a serious view of the situation.Although work was resumed on the 29th April, the rate of loading anddischarging was reported by the Ministry&apos;s local representative to be stillunsatisfactory, and three ships at present on the way to Jamaica have been diverted. The Minister has also issued instructions that no more ships shallload for Jamaica for the present.
128. In view of the fact that the Governor reported on the 29th April thatthe situation was normal, and that any curtailment of shipping will have serious consequences to the people, who are suffering from the effects of a severe drought,and may provoke an outbreak of disorder, the Ministry of War Transport havebeen asked to reconsider the instructions that no more ships shall load for Jamaicaat present.East Africa.129. Non-native immigration restriction regulations have been passed in kenya, Uganda and the Tanganyika Territory on account of the shortage of housing accommodation in the towns and food difficulties. The regulations arenon-racial in character and require every non-native immigrant to be in possessionof a permit, the issue of which will normally be conditional on a certificate fromthe Director of Manpower to the effect that the immigrants intended occupationwill be of direct assistance to the war effort.130. The regulations have been the subject of protests from the Indiancommunities in the territories concerned.Northern Rhodesia.131. A threat of a strike on the Copperbelt developed during the monthas a result of the dissatisfaction of the Northern Rhodesia Mine Workers&apos; union with the results of the conciliation proceedings in connection with the revisionof the Union&apos;s agreement with the Copper Mining Companies. Strike ballotswere held, but 72 per cent, of the members voted against a strike. It is now forthe Union to decide whether they will accept the results of the conciliationproceedings or go to arbitration, and meanwhile the existing agreement remains in force.
