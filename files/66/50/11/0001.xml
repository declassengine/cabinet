Printed for the War Cabinet.  May 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 261.20th May, 1944./WAR CABINET.      /. - 1&apos;TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country Planning.I seek authority to introduce this Bilk before the Whitsun Recess. Promiseshave been made that it shall be introduced and carried into law this Session. TheBill has been approved by the Reconstruction Committee and will be consideredby the Legislation Committee on Tuesday next, the 23rd May (H.P.C. (44) 47),but there are one or two points of principle to which it is considered that theattention of the Cabinet should be drawn. The provisions of the Bill so far asthey relate to the acquisition of land in war-damaged and obsolescent areas andthe provisions regarding the price at which land shall be acquired for public purposes implement promises given in the King&apos;s Speech and in numerousGovernment statements. The remaining provisions of the Bill all relate in someway or other to matters which need to be dealt with urgently in connection withreconstruction in the early days after the war.2. The proposed provisions of the Bill have been discussed with the associations of Local Authorities, who have informed me with some emphasisthat in various respects the Bill falls short of what they consider they have been promised, and of what they regard as essential to an effective programme of reconstruction; and that in one respect the Bill would hamper them in giving effect to a reconstruction programme. The more important matters of which theycomplain are (1) that the change from a &quot; 1939 ceiling &quot; to a &quot; 1939 standard &quot; of prices will be a serious handicap to them;(2) that the procedure for the acquisition of land for reconstruction purposesis too slow and inelastic;(3) that the absence from the Bill of financial provisions for a long-term programme of planning will make it impossible for them to re-plantheir areas comprehensively.1939 Standard.3. Of these three grounds of complaint, that on which local authorities lay .most stress is the change to a 1939 standard of prices. They say, and this istrue, that the Uthwatt Committee said in the plainest terms that their recom-mendations were for a ceiling &quot; Our recommendations are directed not to a fixed price but to a maximum price. Actual values at the time of acquisitionmay well be less than pre-war values owing to causes not connected with thewars&quot; (paragraph 13 (2), Uthwatt Committee, Interim Report, Cmd. .6291) that the Government have on many occasions accepted the principle of the&apos;Uthwatt recommendation; and that in many Government statements the proposal has been expressly stated to be for a &apos;&apos; ceiling &apos;&apos; and that the pledges have been understood by all to mean that a maximum price and not a standard price wouldbe imposed.4.   The Local Authorities contend that in many instances owners are readyto sell at a price well below the 1939 figure, and that the fall of value is in manycases due to permanent causes which have nothing to do with the war; and they -protest with some vigour against an obligation to pay more on compulsory[27490]
acquisition. The result, they say, will be that they will be driven to arbitration in all cases.5. The Local Authorities, indeed, go to the length of saying that theadditional amount which they would be called on to pay, particularly in war-damaged areas, would be of an order which would seriously limit the extent towhich they could undertake reconstruction projects, and that, accordingly, theywould not embark on projects until the provisions of the 1939 standard cease to operate.6. This is a most highly controversial matter. There is a complete answer to any allegation that the Government are irrevocably pledged to the adoptionof a ceiling. The original statement made by Lord Reith on the 17th July, 1941,said : &apos;&apos; The principle must be open to review if circumstances arise which make its application inequitable&quot; (H. L. Official Report, 17th July, 1941, Col. 852).To that, however, the Local Authorities reply in effect that the Government maybe within the literal terms of their undertaking in proposing a standard, but nevertheless that it is an abandonment of the ceiling, and that they would prefer that no provision at all should be made in the matter than that the payment ofa standard price should be imposed ori them.7. There is no doubt much to be said for the view of the Local Authorities.Much, however, was also said on the other side in very full discussions in theReconstruction Committee, with emphasis on the unfairness of compelling an owner to sell at a time when prices may be seriously depressed in some areas by war conditions. Suggestions were carefully considered by the reconstruction committee for differentiating between a fall of prices due to general causes and,those due to war circumstances, but were considered to be administrativelyimpracticable. In the circumstances no other course seems possible than to intro-duce&apos; the Bill as drafted. There will no doubt be a strong attack by therepresentatives of the Local Authorities, and it seems right that this difficult question should be decided in the light of Parliamentary feeling upon it.Procedure for compulsory acquisition.8. The procedure under the Bill of which the Local Authorities complainis, in fact, much more expeditious than under any existing Act. The LocalAuthorities, however, are, with a good deal of justification, impressed with the urgency of their task and with the strength of local feeling, which will demand that they should start actual work in rebuilding devastated areas as soon asthey possibly can when the war ends. They fear the impatience of publicopinion if time appears to be taken by any preliminary formalities. Theprovisions in the Bill are an attempt to strike a fair balance between, on theone hand, the urgent requirements of reconstruction of war-damaged, areas and,on the other, the rights of owners to be informed, in the requisite detail, ofthe projects on which the case for the acquisition of their land is based, andto make representations and to be heard regarding them. This, again, is a controversial matter, and at whatever point the Bill might place the balance between these opposing considerations there would be room for challengefrom either side the owners, on the one side, and the local authorities, on theother. This, again, would seem to be essentially a matter which must be thrashedout on the Committee stage of the Bill.Financial assistance.9. It is understandable that the Local Authorities should wish to. knownow what the financial provisions will be for a long-term programme of recon-struction. On the other hand, the immediate need is the reconstruction ofwar-damaged areas, and not for a good many years to come would it be possiblefor Local Authorities to carry out reconstruction in other areas. The Bill,therefore, meets present needs. How fully those needs will be met by thefinancial provisions of the Bill depends on how those provisions are in factoperated, and it will no doubt be agreed that I should state, in introducing theBill, that they will be operated with the most careful attention to the difficuliesof the Local Authorities in their reconstruction programmes. Moreover, the door has been by no means closed to consideration of financial assistance for local Authorities for the longer-term programme of reconstruction, and con-consultations in this matter between my Department and the Treasury have in fact
