President Roosevelt to Prime Minister. No. 541.   20.5.44.(Personal and Top Secret.)Instead of a tripartite statement to be issued by the United States, UnitedKingdom and Soviet Governments, and in place of a message to the Congress,what would you think of a statement by me alone along these lines, to be issued after D Day ?&quot; It has been suggested that the Allied Governments join in a general statement to the German people and their sympathisers emphasising the landingsrecently made on the Continent of Europe. I have not been in agreement withthis because it might over-emphasise the importance of these landings. what i want to impress on the people of Germany and their sympathisers is theinevitability of their defeat. What I want to emphasise to them is theircontinuation of the war from now on is unintelligent on their part. They mustknow in their hearts that under their present leadership and under their presentobjectives it is inevitable that they will be totally defeated.Every German life that is lost from now on is an unnecessary loss. From acold-blooded point of view it is true that the Allies will suffer losses as well, butthe Allies so greatly outnumber the Germans in population and in resources thaton a relative basis the Germans will be far harder hit down to every family than the Allies. And in the long run mere stubbornness will never help Germany.The Allies have made it abundantly clear that they do not seek the total destruc-tion of the German people. They do seek the total destruction of the philosophyof those Germans who have announced that they could subjugate the world.The Allies are seeking the long-range goal of human freedom a greater trueliberty political, religious and intellectual; and a greater justice, social andeconomic.Our times are teaching us that no group of men can ever be strong enoughto dominate the whole world.The Government and people of the United States, with nearly twice thepopulation of Germany, send word to the people of Germany that this is the-time to abandon the teachings of evil.By far the greater part of the world&apos;s population of nearly two billion peoplefeel the same way. Only Germany and Japan stand out against all the rest of humanity.Every German knows this in his heart; Germany and Japan have made aterrible and disastrous mistake. Germany and Japan must atone reasonably forthe wanton destruction of lives and property which they have committed; andthey must give up an imposed philosophy the falsity of which by now must bevery clear to them.The more quickly the end of the fighting and the slaughter the more quicklyshall we come to a more decent civilisation in the whole world.The attacks which are now being made in the European Theatre by theAmerican, by the British, by the Russian Armies and their associates will, we hope, continue with success but the German people can well realise that theyare only a part of a series of attacks which will increase in number and volumeuntil the inevitable victory is completed.&quot;
