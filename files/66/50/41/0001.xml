Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1944.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.W.P. (44) 291.2nd June, 1944.WAR CABINET.EMPLOYMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE White Paper (Cmd. 6527) on Employment now issued is a documentof the highest importance. For the first time it lays down, as officially recognisedguiding principles : (a) that employment depends on expenditure, and (b) that itis the duty of the Government to control and direct expenditure in the interestsof the stability of employment, and not to leave matters to self-regulating,automatic economic forces.In certain directions, however, more particularly in relation to expenditureoutside the country, whether by way of imports or of foreign investment, itstreatment of the subject is, to say the least of it, sketchy. It contents itself withasserting in Chapter I that the Government is pursuing the best possible policyinternationally without examining what international economic policy followsfrom the principles laid down, or how far the policy actually contemplated by theGovernment squares with those principles.If the true source of employment is expenditure, then the true &quot; employer &quot;is the purchaser. Consequently, if stability of British employment is our object,then the Government must effectively encourage the purchase of British goods and produce and discourage imports of foreign goods, except to the extent to which foreign goods are an essential element in our production or are necessary to make up a definite deficiency in our resources. The matter is not one that can be left tothe mere temporary interest of the individual purchaser on the score of immediatecheapness. The first duty of the Government, therefore, is to ensure that the credits secured by our exports are not dissipated on unessential imports, but are concentrated on those raw materials essential to our national productive effort and on the foodstuffs required over and above the maximum efficient output of ouragriculture. Imports of less essential goods can then be considered if, as theresult of a definite trade agreement, they secure a fully equivalent export, and donot start a decline, or check a development, in British industry.The White Paper in g 40 gives a most interesting picture of how&quot; a minor decline in employment may rapidly gather momentum and take onthe proportions of a major depression.&quot; In the case of the displacement of one british industry by another the employment given by the competing industry may, of course, also gather momentum and offset the tendency towards general depression. That balancing factor does hot come in where the unemployment is created by external competition, unless, indeed, a fully equivalent increase ofBritish production has been definitely secured to compensate for the imports inquestion. The difference is a material one, but it is overlooked by the white paper. Nor does such a remedy for depression as the release of purchasingpower, e.g., by lowering insurance contributions, give any corresponding stimulus to employment if it is, in fact, mainly spent, for reasons of immediate cheapness,on foreign goods.Again, on the principles of the White Paper, capital investment abroad calls for no less effective control. Investment in capital goods in this country affordstwo kinds of employment, first in making the capital goods themselves and secondlyin the continuing employment given by the industry concerned. The second is,of course, the more important in the long run, so much so, indeed, that it may[275641
be fully justifiable from the national point of view to import the machinery required rather than incur any delay or lack of efficiency involved in trying tomake it at home. That being the case, industrial investment abroad may not bejustified, even if the whole capital in question takes the form of an export ofBritish machinery, unless it also contributes directly to securing for us a bettermarket for our exports or a new source of essential imports.In other words, the principles laid down in the White Paper clearly involvea continuous, detailed selective control and direction of our foreign trade bothby the regulation of imports and by the conclusion of specific trade agreementswhose results can be quantitatively estimated, as well as by a similar selectiveand discriminatory control over private external investment.That, however, is precisely the opposite of the policy contemplated in theproposed Commercial and Monetary Union Schemes at present under considera-tion. The Commercial Union scheme is one under which our external trade is left entirely to unregulated price competition on the assumption that in a worldof low tariffs we shall somehow secure an adequate and stable volume of exportssufficient to provide for our essential imports, as well as for such unessentialimports as will inevitably come in as part of an undiscriminating non-selectivetariff and treaty policy. The Monetary Scheme is intended to facilitate that trade policy as well as to promote international investment as such regardless of theneed for its effective control in the national interest.Our national economy is a single closely-connected whole. It cannot be conducted by applying one set of economic principles to that part of our trans-actions which crosses our political frontiers and another set of principles totransactions within our borders. If the principles on which the White Paper isbased are right, then they should be applied to external consumption and invest-ment. In that case the Commercial Union Scheme must be regarded as a directobstacle to their application and the Monetary Scheme as at any rate doubtful.If, on the other hand, the principles underlying the Commercial Union and monetary Schemes are right, then the White Paper plan can only be regarded, asan obstructive interference with the natural automatic self-adjusting flow oftrade, investment and employment which those schemes postulate. The two sets of principles cannot be run in double harness. We must make up our minds toscrap one or the other.L. S. A.India Office, 2nd June, 1944,
