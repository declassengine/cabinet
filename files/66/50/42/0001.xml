Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1944.SECRET. Copy No:W.P. (44) 292.3rd June, 1944.WAR CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, PHILADELPHIA.The Declaration concerning the Aims and Purposes of the InternationalLabour Organisation adopted at the International Labour Conferenceat Philadelphia.Note by the Minister of Labour and National Service.I hope to circulate at an early date a full report on the proceedings of the26th Session of the International Labour Conference held at Philadelphia the20th April-12th May, 1944, but in the meantime I should like to draw attentionto the important Declaration concerning the Aims and Purposes of the Inter-national Labour Organisation which was unanimously adopted by the Conferenceon the 10th May.2. In this Declaration, the text of which is given as an Annex to this note (Annex I), the International Labour Conference (1) reaffirms the funda-mental principles on which the Organisation is based; (2) declares that it is a responsibility of the International Labour Organisation to examine and considerall international economic and financial policies and measures in the light of thefundamental social objective defined in the Declaration and that in dischargingthe tasks entrusted to it the Organisation, having considered all relevant economicand financial factors, may include in its decisions and recommendations any provisions which it considers appropriate; (3) recognises the solemn obligation of the International Labour Organisation to further among the nations of theworld programmes which will achieve a series of aims enumerated in theDeclaration; (4) pledges the - full co-operation of the International LabourOrganisation with such international bodies as may- be entrusted with a share ofthe responsibility for securing the fuller and broader utilisation of the world&apos;sproductive resources and, for the promotion of the health, education and well-being of all peoples; and (5) affirms that the principles set forth in the Declaration are fully applicable to all peoples everywhere and that, while the manner of. their -application must be determined with due regard to the stage of social andeconomic development reached by each people, their progressive application topeoples who are still dependent, as well as to those who have already achievedself-government, is a matter of concern to the whole civilised world.3. The Special Drafting Committee appointed by the Conference toexamine the original draft of the Declaration, the Chairman of which was thePresident of the Conference (Mr. Walter Nash of New Zealand), included inits report to the Conference the following passage : &quot; The Committee wishes to emphasise that the first part of the text, byreaffirming the fundamental principles on which the Organisation is based,underlines that the Declaration does not in any way subtract from theexisting force of the provisions of the Constitution of the Organisation.The Committee also thinks it important to draw the attention of theConference to the fact that the terms of the Declaration must be read as awhole, %nd that the individual expressions contained therein must be under-stood in the light of the context in which they appear and of the other provisions of the Declaration.  This is the more important since the breaking[27575]
up of the original continuous text into a number of short paragraphs maylead to those paragraphs being given a much wider interpretation than theycan properly bear. The pledge contained in Part IV that the InternationalLabour Organisation will co-operate fully with other international bodiesindicates clearly that the Organisation realises the part which other international agencies will be called upon to play, and that its own part,great as it may be in the treatment of social questions and in defining thesocial objective, is only a share of the task to be accomplished.&quot;4. The British Government Delegates to the Conference gave full support to the Declaration.5. I regard the Declaration as of the utmost importance. It expresses, inwords which touch the imagination, the fundamental social rights and aims ofall.persons. We shall undoubtedly be pressed shortly for an expression of our attitude towards the Declaration indeed, I have already been asked this bymeans of Supplementary Questions by Mr. Mander and Mr. Shinwell, andMr. Mander has now put down another question for next Thursday, the 8th June.It is my view that we should lose no time in announcing that we warmly welcpmethe Declaration and accept completely the principles which it contains. Subjectto the agreement of my colleagues, I propose to do this as soon as possible bymeans of a reply to Mr. Mander, draft of which is attached to this memorandum(Annex II). At the same time I propose to circulate the text of the declaration in the Official Report.E.
