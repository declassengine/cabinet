Completesurprise was effected and considerable damage caused, including hits on ten ships(35,000 tons), including a tanker and possibly a destroyer, some of which were probably sunk. Two floating docks1 were seriously damaged. An oil refinerywas destroyed and a direct hit. demolished the power house. Storage cisterns andsheds were set on fire. Considerable damage was caused to naval installations and the Braat naval engineering works were destroyed. In addition, two enemy aircraft were shot down and 19 were destroyed and others damaged on the airfields. In spite of considerable A.A. fire only one Allied aircraft failed toreturn; two aircraft crashed on taking off but the crews were rescued. No othercasualties or damage were sustained by the Allied forces.

Twenty-three small ships are also engaged in this trade.It is reported that 60 small tanker barges have arrived in the Adriatic from belgium and are being used for supplying the Dalmatian Islands.MILITARY SITUATION.Italy.   (An outline map is&apos;included as an inset.)20. Our Italian offensive has continued to prosper well during the last week,and the threat to the enemy has now increased through a break-out from the bridgehead.On the 18th the long-coveted Monastery Hill fell to troops of the PolishCorps, and the same day British forces who had crossed Highway 6 to the southcaptured the town of Cassino. To the south of them Canadian troops wereadvancing towards the Hitler Line; the next day, the 19th, they were reportedin contact with the line E. and N.E. of Pontecorvo, where they met withstiff resistance. It now became apparent that this stretch between Aquinoand Pontecorvo was to be the toughest part of the Hitler Line which we wouldhave to face, and for the next few days we made no substantial progress inthis sector, some of our forces being counter-attacked and compelled to retirein the region of Aquino. Similarly, the next objective for the Poles, Piedimonte,showed signs of becoming another Cassino in miniature, and still, at the time ofwriting, defies capture.21. During the same period progress was swift in the French and U.S.sectors. Advancing towards Pico and Itri, the French and U.S. Corpsrespectively swept forward over the very difficult mountainous country until, onthe 19th, the US. forces captured Itri and cut the main north-south road. Thenext day, the French, who Avere by now meeting stiffened resistance, cut the Pico-Pontecorvo road and, by the 21st, French elements were in Pico itself. Fromhere they were counter-attacked fiercely, but reoccupied the place on the 22nd, and continued the advance northwards towards San Giovanni and Ceprano.Meanwhile the U.S. Corps, having thrust forward to Fondi, which is one ofthe bastions of the Hitler switch line, had advanced in conformation to the south,to include within their lines Gaeta and Sperlonga.22. Although fighting continued fiercely throughout these few days, it was,relatively speaking, a lull before the next attack, for General Alexander had ordered a concerted attack all the way along the main front for the morning ofthe 23rd, to be synchronised with a break-out from the eastern corner of the bridgehead. The Canadian Corps had the task of breaking the Hitler line between Aquino and Pontecorvo, and this they accomplished by the 24th.: Bythe afternoon they had their leading armoured elements on the eastern banks of
the Melfa, a stream about half way between Pontecorvo and Ceprano. On the left of the Canadians, the French Corps met a determined resistance on the partof the enemy to stop the envelopment of Pontecorvo, but by the 24th they were only 1,500 yards from San Giovanni, on their right flank, and approachingPastena, on their left flank; further to the west still, French forces were within two miles of Vallecorsa. The U.S. forces on the French left flank had meanwhilemade a considerable advance in the direction of Priverno, capturing the villagesof Sonnino and RocCasecca Dei Volsci. On their coastal flank, after stiff fighting in the mountains north of Terracina, they captured the town, and by the 24thwere reported to have reconnaissance elements three miles forward of the place.^) This means that they are now astride Highway 7, better known as the: Appian Way. The effects of the offensive of the 23rd on the main front, therefore,were that the Adolf Hitler Line was largely overrun, only isolated strong-pointssuch as Piedimonte, Aquino and Pontecorvo still holding out.23. The offensive in the bridgehead opened with a prelude of a tremendousbarrage at 0630 hours the 23rd. Against considerable resistance, small advanceswere made in the general direction of Cisterna. The Appian Way was cut three miles south-east of the town and the railway reached, and west of the town,armoured units were within 500 yards of the railway. About 500 prisoners were taken in the first day. By the 24th, the railway to the west of Cisterna hadbeen cut and U.S. patrols were in the town itself.. Armoured elements had madesubstantial progress, and were between three and four miles north-west ofCisterna, towards Belletri.Despite the publicity given in the press and in German commentaries to theactivities of Allied forces on the western perimeter of the bridgehead, all thatreally happened was some small-scale raids by British forces up the Anzio-Carroceta road, and across the mouth of the Moletta on the coast. In the latterexpedition some tanks succeeded in getting across, but the enemy counter-attacked on the 24th with partial success.Russo-German Campaign.24.   There has been no change in the situation.Yugoslavia.25. In Serbia, Partisan forces have driven the enemy from mountains some20 miles west of Nis and resisted a subsequent counter-attack.In Bosnia, fighting in the Sarajevo area has continued and the enemy hasbeen reinforced.In Croatia, the Partisans have again taken the initiative : details of engage-ments have not yet been received.In the north the Germans are reported as having begun a violent offensive to recover the main lines of communication in Slovenia. Operations have been particularly directed upon the Novo Mesto-Ljubljana railway.British commandos and infantry landed unopposed on the island of Mjleton the night of the 22nd/23rd : U.S. special troops are also taking part in theoperation. No details have yet been received, except that the enemy (who are believed to number some 300-400) were surrounded by 0900 hours on the 23rd.Burma.Arakan.26.   Activity has been confined to local activity in the areas 4^ miles south-0      west of Buthidaung.Chin Hills and Chindwin.27. By an outflanking movement from the east on the 17th our troops cut the Imphal-Tiddim road behind the enemy fifteen miles south of Bishenpur andhave established road blocks.The Japanese attacked one of our administrative areas five miles S.W. ofBishenpur on the night of the 20th/21st. They also attacked a divisional head-quarters ; both these attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties to the enemy.The Imphal-Kohima road has now been cleared to a point sixteen miles .W. of Imphal.[27525]    . b 2
Activity in the Kohima area consisted of a number of sharp engagements inwhich the Japanese have been cleared from a number of their positions andhave suffered severe casualties.Chinese-U.S. Forces.28. On the 17th a Chinese/United States column captured the airfieldsouth of Myitkyina. This column was subsequently reinforced and one-third ofthe town is now in Allied hands.   Fighting for the town continues.A Chinese expeditionary force crossed the Salween River on the 17th alonga 120-mile front and advanced some few miles west of the river.New Guinea.29. On the 17th a U.S. force, supported by Allied cruisers and destroyers,landed at Arare on the mainland of New Guinea and on the following daycaptured the island of Wakde. During the 19th U.S. forces made additionallandings on Liki and Niroemoar Islands (25 miles west of Wakde).AIR SITUATION.General Review.30. Heavy attacks were made on Berlin, Brunswick and Kiel by day, and onDuisburg, Dortmund, Brunswick and Aachen by night.In France and the Low Countries, the main weight of a heavy effort was directed against railway centres, rolling stock and airfields.In Italy, intensive support was provided for our land forces.United Kingdom.31. During daylight, one enemy aircraft was reported overland. On the night of the 22nd/23rd 75 long-range bombers, of which six were destroyed,operated off the South Coast; some 60 of these made shallow pentrations overlandin the Portsmouth area. On the same night 10 enemy aircraft operated asintruders off and over the East Coast, and two reconnaissance aircraft flew overScotland. On the remaining nights a total of 11 enemy aircraft flew overland,and a number of others operated off shore.Home Waters.32. On the 19th, escorted Beaufighters (one missing) attacked a convoyconsisting of one destroyer and four minesweepers, off Ushant. The destroyerwas hit with six, possibly 14, rocket projectiles, one minesweeper was left on fire and another was probably damaged.On the 23rd, escorted Typhoons damaged two ships of 3,000 and 1,500 tons respectively, off the Brest Peninsula.A number of attacks were made, by night, on E-boats and other small craftoff the coasts of France and the Low Countries; two E-boats were set on fire, atrawler, an escort vessel and at least seven more E-boats were damaged, and fiveother ships were probably damaged.Mine-laying aircraft, of which 260 were despatched, laid 993 sea-mines in enemy waters; three aircraft ai*e missing and a fourth crashed.Germany. j33. Heavy bombers operated in strength on three days of the week, the maintargets being Berlin and Brunswick on the 19th, Kiel on the 22nd, and Berlinagain on the 24th. In the two attacks on the German capital, a total of1,922 tons of bombs was dropped, the results being reported as good in the firstoperation but, owing to heavy cloud, were largely unobserved in the second.Results at Brunswick* (714 tons) and Kiel (556 tons) were good and fair to goodrespectively. From the 1,872 bombers and 2,027 fighters despatched, 64 bombers and 47 fighters are missing; enemy casualties in combat and on the groundwere 239 destroyed, 52 probably destroyed and 83 damaged and, in addition,31 locomotives were also destroyed.By night, strong bomber forces were despatched against Duisburg on the21st/22nd, Dortmund and Brunswick on the 22nd/23rd, and two railway centres
at Aachen on the 24th/25th. Over Duisburg, there was heavy cloud into whichmarkers rapidly disappeared and most aircraft had to bomb on the estimatedposition of the target and it is probable that the 2.202 tons dropped were widelyscattered. Similar conditions prevailed at Brunswick (620 tons). However, atDortmund (1,623 tons) and at the two railway centres at Aachen (2,021 tons),visibility was good and well concentrated attacks were delivered. Losses onthese operations were 87 bombers missing and three crashed, a percentage of 5 - 7to the sorties despatched.Forces of between 20 and 30 Mosquitoes, without loss, bombed Cologne,dusseldorf, Hanover, Ludwigshafen and Dortmund, and two rather smaller raids were made on Berlin.France and the Low Countries.34. A heavy scale of effort was maintained throughout the week and involved the despatch of 10,393 bombers and fighter-bombers by day, and 1,786 bombers(including 339 intruders) by night. Fighters, on escort and offensive patrols,involved a further 5,905 sorties.   The distribution of the effort is as follows : &apos;l^a) Railway Centres and Rail Communications. Sixty of these objectives were attacked with over 4,500 tons of bombs and 634 rocket projectiles. the six heaviest raids, all at night, were made against railway centres; Orleans (LesAub.rais)* and Le Mans* were each attacked twice with totals of 1,054 tonsand 938 tons respectively, the remaining two objectives being at Boulogne(560 tons) and Tours* (528 tons). An effective daylight attack by Mustangsresulted in the destruction of an important railway bridge at Hasselt in Belgium.(b) Railway Rolling-stock. &quot;During the week, 228 locomotives were destroyed and a further 210 were damaged, 318 of these casualties taking placeon the 21st when 1,570 fighters operated over an area extending from N.W.Germany to Central France.(c) Airfields. -These were attacked on 75 occasions with a total of nearly5,000 tons of bombs. The heaviest attacks, all by Fortresses and Liberators,were made on Orly* (642 tons in two attacks), Orleans/Bricy (458 tons), Melun(447 tons), Etampes/Mondesir (259 tons), Avord* (222 tons), Villacoublay* (171tons) and Rheims/Champagne (142 tons); either good or very good results are reported from all these operations. Liberators made an effective raid on an aircraft works at Bourges* (206 tons).(d) Field and Coastal Batteries. These were attacked by 1,264 aircraft which dropped 2,935 tons, of which 1,403 tons were dropped at night.(e) Military Objectives. Of the 901 tons dropped on these targets 665 were released by Fortresses and Liberators in two blind bombing attacks in the pas de Calais area.(f) Radar Installations. Twenty-six raids were made by small forces ofTyphoons and Mosquitoes which released 1,197 rocket projectiles and 72 tons of bombs. In addition, a night attack by 31 heavy bombers was made on an installa-tion at Mont Couple, near Calais.(g) Other Targets. On the night 24th/25th a concentrated attack by48 heavy bombers, which dropped 208 tons of bombs, was made on a motorassembly plant at Antwerp.A general&apos;s headquarters at Rouen is believed to have been destroyed as theresult of a raid by eight R.P. Typhoons.Troop billets in the Rouen and Boulogne areas and fuel cisterns near Amienswere amongst other targets subjected to small-scale attacks.In the weeks operations 13 heavy, 2 medium and 4 light bombers, and 104fighter-bombers and fighters were lost; 45 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combatand 104 on the ground.Italy.35. During the week ended the 2drd May A Hied aircraft of the M.A .A .F.flew a total of 14,122 sorties; 82 aircraft were lost and 31 enemy aircraftAllied aircraft of all types provided intensive support for our land forcesin the battle zones, and further north attacked communications and other targetsover an extensive area.In an area south of a line Rome/Avezzano to the battle lines, enemy targetsof all kinds were subjected to very heavy and effective attacks.   The total number
of offensive sorties flown in these operations was 3,094. The road (Highway 6)running back from the Liri Valley to Frosinone, Ferentino and Valmontone was heavily attacked, also the roads to Rome from the Anzio battlefront, and roads inthe areas of Sezze, Terracina, Ceccano and Avezzano. Other roads, together withrailways and bridges, were successfully attacked in rear of the battle area. Anumber of road blocks were created. In spite of adverse weather, whichconsiderably affected the operations, heavies dropped about 1,200 tons on thesetargets. Other bombers and fighters destroyed or damaged over 300 M.T. vehicles,secured hits on a number of bridges, railway tracks, and many roads; very effectiveattacks were also made on bivouac areas, troop concentrations, tanks, gun andmortar positions, fuel and ammunition dumps, and command posts. At night,similar targets, principally roads in the battle zones, were successfully attacked by medium and light bombers. During all these operations a few enemy aircraft were encountered and 11 were shot down; 33 Allied aircraft were lost.In central and northern Italy medium and fighter-bombers attacked roads,railways and, in particular, bridges, of which at least six were destroyed and afurther 14 hit. Several tunnels were blocked, three viaducts hit, a number ofrailway centres effectively attacked, many tracks cut and roads hit. Severaltrains, locomotives, a considerable number of M.T., and rolling stock units were damaged.Heavy bombers, except for their operations in rear of the battle lines,concentrated their attacks on railway centres and ports. The principal targetsattacked were Rimini (178 tons), IJdine (194 tons), Bologna (121 tons), Faenza (87tons), Spezia (550 tons), Genoa and Leghorn (325 tons), Porto Marghera (114tons), Piombino (101 tons) and at Avisio (184 tons).

Very little information has been received of the activity of the russian air Force; it is known, however, that there has been some fighter activity aroundTiraspol, Jassy and Stanislavo^    A number of successful attack? onj (German
shipping in the Gulf of Finland are reported. Formations of Russian groundattack aircraft were employed in attacks on enemy shipping in the Black Sea.Russian long-range bombers attacked rail communications and rolling stock atMinsk, Baranovichi (near Minsk) and Chelm (near Lublin).Burma.41. Allied aircraft, for the week ended dawn on the 23rd, flew a total of3,064 sorties; 12 Allied aircraft were lost, and 12 enemy aircraft were shot downand a further six destroyed on the ground.Allied transport aircraft flew 2,199 sorties, carrying 3,965 tons, 11,758 men,and evacuated 1,938 casualties.The main Allied effort was again directed against targets in the Chindwin-Assam area, where bombers and fighter bombers flew a total of 790 sorties. Aconsiderable variety of targets was attacked, principally in the areas ofBishenpur, Imphal and Kohima, and against lines of communications to Manipur.Landslides were caused, by bombing, on the Tiddim-Imphal road, making enemysupply problems acute.Almost an equal Allied effort was concentrated upon targets in the Myitkyinaarea, where 600 sorties were flown by bombers and fighter bombers. Some of the many targets attacked included the railway station and town of Myitkyina,bridges, of which five were destroyed, enemy positions, and small shipping on theIrrawaddy.In the Mandalay area attacks were made on oil installations at Chauk, the airfield at Shwebo, and a variety of railway targets.China Zone.42.

The U-Bahn between Friedrichstrasseand Hallesches Tor and the Alexander Platz and Frankfurter Alle was still not open to traffic as a result of damage caused in the daylight attacks on the7th and 8th May. Damage at the Ostkreuz Junction, through which the greaterpart of the traffic for the Eastern front passes, was sufficient to cause re-routingof this traffic for several days, with considerable dislocation. The population is so affected by the continuance of attacks that the Mosquito raids are very effective in sending people to shelters and dislocating production.[27525] c
