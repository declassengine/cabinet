Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 263 (Revise).2%th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF BRITISH AIRLINES.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.Overseas Airlines.THE B.O.A.C. has certain statutory rights and privileges, with accom-accompanying  obligations. It has a monopoly of subsidy for overseas air services but no statutory monopoly of operation. It is the contractual successor of imperial airways, who received  900,000 a year before the war from Postal Administra-tions taking part in the Empire Air Mail Scheme* on the basis that all first-classmail was sent by air.*2. There is nothing to prevent the Post Office of the United Kingdomgiving mail contracts to other airline companies. And South Africa has indicated her intention to abrogate all Air Transport agreements. That may include air mail contracts. The Canadian Minister of Munitions and supply has intimated his intention of taking a similar course.3. Authority is desired to license other interests to prepare their plans for operating overseas services now with authority to begin operations when aircraft and personnel are available. Routes should be apportioned in accordance withan orderly arrangement.4. By doing so we shall mobilise behind British Civil Aviation our shipping and trading interests with their trained personnel and old-established connectionsthroughout the World.5. Expansion of British overseas airline operations would be secured without subsidy. The Government would, of course, be asked to provide airfields,radio and meteorological facilities.6. Civil air services will be a source of revenue to the State through licensingfees, postal surcharges, &amp;c. In the financial year ended the 30th June, 1943,American airlines made an operating profit of 33 million dollars. During thesame period the net income of the United States Post Office from air mail chargesexceeded its payments to the airline companies by 33 million dollars.7. Competition will provide a valuable stimulus to economy of operation and efficiency of service. . The regulated competition of independent airline companies in the United States has been an important factor-in producing the most efficientair transport services in the World.8. Comparison of expenses and revenue as between one operating company and another would be1 made possible through the examination of accounts. Thusan additional safeguard would be provided against incompetence and unreason-able profit margins.9. A wide choice of opportunities for employment would be afforded totrained personnel,&apos; now in the fighting services. Such a choice, so important for the individual, cannot exist in the conditions of monopoly.* Forty Postal Administrations throughout the Empire took part in the Air Mail Scheme,including all of the Dominions.Ifl   [27534] WBWW:MMiMM$Copy No.
Internal A irlines.10. The B.O.A.C. cannot operate internal air services without statutory authority. There is therefore no obstacle to granting licences so that private companies may conduct airlines within this country.11. I ask that authority be given for the granting of these licences now.Some aircraft could be made available, and operation begin, when groundpersonnel can be obtained.B.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1.2Qth May, 1944.
