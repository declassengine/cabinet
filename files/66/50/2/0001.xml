Air Vice-Marshal Foster concludes by saying : &quot; The actual flying units have shown unexpected good qualities. I havebeen frankly surprised at the operational standard, produced. I consider thatas far as their own Air Force is concerned, the Italians have met in full theobligation which they undertook at the time of the Armistice. The Italian AirForce has during the past six months made a whole-hearted effort to contributeits share in operations against the enemy, and I feel that this fact should beplainly recorded so it can be placed to the credit of the Italians when the timefor settlement comes.&quot;5.   I am sending a copy of this minute to the Foreign-Secretary.(Initialled) A. H. M. S.9th May, 1944.[27453]
