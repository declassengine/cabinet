BRIDGES,Secretary.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,1st June, 1944.AN OUTLINE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERN-MENT AND GENERAL DE GAULLE BETWEEN JUNE 1940 and june .1943.I. The Origin of the Free French Movement.   June-August 1940.1. De Gaulle reached London on the 17th June, and in broadcasts from london on the 18th and 22nd June appealed to all Frenchmen to join him in continuing the war beside Great Britain.2. On the 28th June His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised him as &quot;. leader of all Free Frenchmen, wherever they may be, who rally to him in support of theAllied cause.&quot; That evening he announced in a broadcast that all Frenchmen on british territory were under his authority and. that volunteer French land, sea and air forces would be formed immediately.3. In a letter of the 30th July to the Prime Minister, de Gaulle announced his intention of forming a Council for the Defence of France Overseas, com-prising the leaders of rallied colonies, and asked whether His Majesty&apos;^Government would recognise such a Council. In his reply of the 5th August, thePrime Minister stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to discuss with such a Council questions concerning the Free French colonies.4. A further exchange of letters between the Prime Minister and de Gaulleof the 7th August, 1940, covered a memorandum giving legal status to the free french forces in this country and providing for their organisation.* W.P.

5. During this period de Gaulle was held in the highest esteem by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and they frequently sought his opinion on questions concerning France. His relations with, the British authorities in the militarysphere were not, however, always so happy, and he frequently complained thathis recruiting efforts were being frustrated by the inefficiency or lack of compre-hension of British officers and officials. More than once the Prime Ministerintervened in his support.II. The Dakar expedition and the rallying of the Free French colonies.September-October 1940.6. At the end of August French Equatorial Africa and the Cameroonsrallied to de Gaulle at the moment when he was leaving England with the Dakarexpedition. After the failure of that expedition he proceeded to Duala andBrazzaville and returned to London in November. He continued to enjoy the full confidence of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Prime Minister stated in the Houseof Commons on the 8th October that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have no inten-tion whatever of abandoning the cause of General de Gaulle until it is merged,as merged it will be, in the larger cause of France.&quot; De Gaulle refrained fromrecriminations after the failure of the expedition, and. his attitude made an excellent impression in England. His entourage were not, however, held in thesame esteem, for it was widely believed that Vichy had been forewarned of the enterprise owing to indiscretions, if not worse, at Carlton Gardens, and thatde Gaulle had been grossly misinformed by his agents about the strength of hisfollowing in French West Africa. These suspicions of Free French reliabilityplayed their part in fomenting later troubles. There was also some friction withthe British military authorities on the spot during de Gaulle&apos;s stay at Brazzaville,due to his insistence on rallying by force Gaboon the only province of french equatorial Africa still subject to Vichy in face of the opposition of the british general Officer Commanding in West Africa, who considered the operationimpracticable. The General Officer Commanding was proved wrong, for the campaign was short and successful.7. Before leaving Africa de Gaulle inaugurated the Council of Defence ofthe Empire in a series of proclamations issued at Brazzaville on the 27th October.These proclamations were followed by a long statement purporting to prove thatthe new Council was the only legal successor to the Government of the ThirdRepublic. His Majesty&apos;s Government duly recognised the Council in the termsalready agreed, but made it clear that they were not to be regarded, as expressingany views on the constitutional and juridical considerations raised in the state-ment. This statement had, in fact, caused * some misgivings to His Maje&quot;sty&apos;sGovernment, who regarded it as an attempt by de Gaulle, to establish for himselfquasi-governmental status with their implied approval. It also gave a handle tode Gaulle&apos;s French critics, who represented it as an indication that he was seeking political powers for which he had. no mandate.III. Consolidation and organisation of the Free French Movement.November 1940-June 1941.8. These months were not marked by any major development in Anglo-Free,French relations. De Gaulle remained in England building up his movement athome and abroad. This would have been impossible without constant Britishhelp and co-operation. Minor friction occurred, especially in the military sphere,but on the whole co-operation at the Departmental level was /good. This wasespecially so over the affairs of Free French Africa, where M. Pleven, sent out as first Secretary-General to French Equatorial Africa, did admirable work inclose harmony with British economic experts. Most of the basic agreements between His Majesty&apos;s Government and de Gaulle belong to this period., wiz., theMilitary Jurisdiction Agreement (the 15th January),, the Economic agreement regarding the Cameroons (the 21st January), the Credit and Financial Agree-ments (the 19th March), and the Economic Agreement regarding french equatorial Africa (the 20th May).9. On the higher political level relations also remained friendly, although,doubtless as a result of the suspicions of Free French reliability engendered at dakar, de Gaulle was no longer consulted on military matters. For his part heshowed increasing resentment at our attitude towards Vichy and, especially a tour support of the American policy of bolstering up the French authorities in north Africa by the controlled supply of food-stuffs and, raw materials.
IV. Troubles in Syria and Free French Africa.  July-September 1941.&quot;10. The Syrian campaign, which had been planned in co-operation with de Gaulle and in which Free French troops played an active part, opened onthe 8th June, 1941, and ended with the signature of the armistice on the 14th July.The first serious rift between His Majesty&apos;s Government and de Gaulle datesfrom the Syrian armistice. De Gaulle was disgusted at the lenient terms givento the Vichy leaders and regarded the airmistice almost as a betrayal of FreeFrance. Two days after its signature he made an offensive reference to it in astatement to the press at Brazzaville, thus, for the first time, publicly advertisinga difference between himself and His Majesty&apos;s Government. . A few days laterhe went to Cairo, where he had some stormy interviews with the then Minister ofState, Mr. Lyttelton. He at first refused to accept the armistice terms, although his&apos;representative had signed them, declared that he would not leave his troops under British military command in the Middle East (the first Of many laterattempts to blackmail us into giving him his way by threat of violent action)and spoke insultingly of the behaviour of the British military authorities. Therewas some excuse for de Gaulle&apos;s indignation, for our military authorities had infact shown excessive generosity in their conduct of the armistice negotiations and made many concessions which His Majesty&apos;s Government might not have approvedhad they been consulted; but he largely destroyed his case by his intemperateand Anglophobe language with Mr. Lyttelton and on private occasions. Agree-ment was eventually patched up at Cairo and de Gaulle went on to Syria. while there he conducted himself with extreme arrogance, ignoring the spirit and some-. times even the letter of the agreements that he had just signed. Friction was increased by acts of discourtesy by the local British authoriies whitch the free french reciprocated.11. De Gaulle was persuaded to return to England for consultation. he did so via Brazzaville, where, on the 26tih August, he gave an astonishinginterview to a correspondent of the Chicago Daily News. According to the published version, de Gaulle had announced his readiness to grant far-reachingmilitary facilities to the United States Government (which was angered andembarrassed by this unsolicited offer) and made some offensive references to theBritish policy towards Vichy. De Gaulle, on his own initiative, issued adementi and claimed that the published story was unauthorised and in partsuntrue. This was probably a fact, but there seems little doubt that he had spokenoh these lines even if &quot;off the record.&apos;&apos; The incident made a most unfortunateimpression in London and Washington where the dementi failed at the time tocarry conviction.12. Apart from this interview, de Gaulle did much &quot;mischief while in free french Africa by indulging in anti-British talk at private meetings with officersand officials. Still under the influence of his Syrian experiences, he urged his subordinates to suspect British Intentions and to be cautious in meeting british requirements.V. Trouble at Home.  September 194A-June 1942.(a) Formation of the National Committee and efforts to restore more cordial relations.   September-December 1941.13. As soon as de Gaulle returned to London in September, the PrimeMinister had a;formal meeting with him at which he took him severely to taskfor his behaviour in Syria and at Brazzaville, and said that he now felt that hewas no longer dealing with a friend. De Gaulle denied any hostile intentionstowards Great Britain, excused his behaviour on the ground of provocation fromthe local British authorities and his own unfortunate temperament and expressed his frank regrets. After reviewing the various outstanding points of differencethe Prime Minister concluded the interview with a suggestion that de Gaulleshould place the Free French Movement on a more democratic basis by devolvinghis personal responsibility for it upon a committee of its leading figures.De Gaulle was also urged from within his own movement to take this step andon the 24th September he established the French National Committee. In a letterto de Gaulle of the 26th. September, the Foreign Secretary informed him of theterms on which His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised the Committee.[27560] b2
14. For the remainder of 1941 relations were better than for some time past.Flis Majesty&apos;s Government regarded the formation of the National committee with satisfaction, and in various ways tried to show de Gaulle that they were anxious to return to their former close collaboration with him, if he would loyallyplay his part. It was arranged for him to have friendly talks with the Chiefs ofStaff, so that he might again feel that he was being taken into our war councils.Fie and his chief lieutenants were also taken around the country more frequentlyto see various aspects of the war effort. De Gaulle responded with generousreferences to British policy and to Anglo-French friendship in various public utterances. The most notable was his address to Oxford undergraduates on the25th November on the theme of Anglo-French friendship as an essential factor of western civilisation.(b) St. Pierre and Miquelon.  December 1941-January 1942.15. On Christmas Eve 1941 Free French naval forces under Admiral Muselier seized St. Pierre and Miquelon. An operation against these islands hadbeen planned some time previously, but at the last moment objections were raisedby the United States Government, who feared the effect on their relations with vichy, and de Gaulle was asked for and gave an undertaking to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to postpone the project. The seizure of the islands was a directbreach of this undertaking. The State Department reacted violently and HisMajesty&apos;s Government had difficulty in convincing the United States Governmentthat they had not connived at de Gaulle&apos;s action. De Gaulle scarcely attempted to defend himself, and it was clear that he decided to act as he did in the belief that the islands would remain indefinitely under Vichy if the Americans had their way, but that if he faced them with a fait accompli he would be left in possession.Events proved him right, for discussions about the possible neutralisation of the islands proved abortive and His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment passively accepted the fact of Free French occupation. The fact thatthe Prime Minister paid a warm tribute to de Gaulle and his followers in his address to the Canadian Parliament on the 30th December probably helped tosmooth over the crisis. The press and public in the United Kingdom largelysympathised with de Gaulle&apos;s action, but the President and Mr. Hull never forgavehim for it, and it was thereafter difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to regardhim as a man whose word could be trusted.(c) The Muselier crisis.   January-Mpurch. 1942.16. There had been increasing tension during the autumn between de gaulle and Muselier, partly through personal rivalry and partly because of Muselier&apos;sopposition to what he regarded as de Gaulle&apos;s dictatorial methods. In Januaryde Gaulle announced his intention of dismissing Muselier, both from the Com-mittee and from the command of the Navy. It looked as if such a step would lead to the disruption of the Free French Movement, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment did all in their power to effect a compromise. De Gaulle muchresented their efforts at mediation, which he regarded as interference in Frenchinternal affairs, and talked wildly of throwing in his hand altogether : he wasalso reported to have reverted to anti-British talk on private occasions. In theend de Gaulle again got his way and Muselier was replaced by Auboyneau; andthis was done without splitting the National Committee or causing a mutiny inthe Free French Navy.17. Throughout this crisis the appearance of cordial relations was main-tainecl. Nevertheless, the Muselier dispute soon became common knowledge inFleet Street; and for the first time there was considerable feeling outside officialcircles that de Gaulle had put himself in the wrong by his autocratic behaviour.Defenders of the republican tradition like Cambon, Labarthe (the editor of&quot;FranceLibre) and Comert (the editor of France) championed Muselier and were active in, influencing opinion against de Gaulle.(d) Differences of view about Metropolitan France.18. During this period the British, and still more the American, attitudetowards Vichy was a constant source of contention with de Gaulle. The general had by this time considerably developed his connexions with the growing resist-ance movements inside France, and claimed almost unanimous support there.He v/as convinced that no good could ever come of Anglo-American&apos;attempts tocultivate the sounder elements in the post-armistice army and administration.
The Free French Movement had by now moved more to the Left, and de Gaulleheld that the future of France lay solely with the quasi revolutionary resistancemovements acting under his leadership.19. The result was frequent polemics between de Gaulle and the Americans.His Majesty&apos;s Government did their best to compose these differences bycounselling discretion to de Gaulle and by trying to make the State Departmentrealise that their information about him, was &quot;often biased and inaccurate. these efforts had little success. The United States Government continued to look uponde Gaulle as an embryo dictafor, all the more dangerous for his democratic pose,who would upset their plans for working through the &quot;respectable&quot; elementsat Vichy. De Gaulle for his part remained convinced that&quot; the United StatesGovernment were committed to the reactionary and, as he would describe it,traitor camp and would do their utmost to thwart him at every turn.VI. Madagascar.  De Gaulle again in the Middle East.   May-September 1942.20. De Gaulle was not consulted about the British plan to occupyMadagascar. It was our intention to hand Madagascar over to the national committee if it was captured by force of arms; but if, as we thought possible, the island authorities rallied to the Allied cause without accepting the Committee&apos;authority, we were prepared to acquiesce. After the occupation of Diego Suarezearly in May there were protracted and in the event abortive negotiations with theGovernor-General. It was considered essential to keep the Free French away from the island while these negotiations were in progress and in consequenceevasive replies had to be given to de Gaulle&apos;s repeated requests for facilities tosend representatives to Diego Suarez. This delay caused de Gaulle alreadyangered by his exclusion from the original operation to suspect that we did not intend in any circumstances to let him have Madagascar. His old bitternessabout the British returned, and on the 6th June he sent a violent telegram toGenerals Catroux, Leclerc and de Larminat. In this telegram, a copy of which fell into our hands in Cairo, he alleged that we were trying to keep him out ofMadagascar and were planning with the Americans an operation against Dakarfrom which the Free French would be excluded. He said that he was not disposed to remain associated with Great Britain and the United States, that the free french should form a united front against all comers and have no relations withthe Anglo-Saxons, and must warn the whole world, and the French people,against Anglo-Saxon imperialist designs. The three recipients were not slow to let their British contacts know of the dismay which the telegram had causedthem, although they did not reveal its whole content. When taken to task by theForeign Secretary, de Gaulle recanted to some extent and agreed to put mattersright by a second and reassuring telegram. But relations remained tense, andwhen de Gaulle shortly after asked for facilities to visit Syria and Free FrenchAfrica, His Majesty&apos;s Government hesitated for some weeks before accordingthem for fear lest he should take the opportunity, as in the previous year, ofstirring up anti-British feeling. In the end he was allowed to go at the beginningof August after giving a solemn promise of good behaviour.21. It should be noted that, as during earlier disputes with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, de Gaulle did not allow his bitter feelings to colour his public utterances. While smarting under the thinly disguised veto on his departure, hedelivered a tribute to Franco-Scottish friendship at Edinburgh on the 23rd June,in which he referred in flattering terms to the achievements of British arms. .22. De Gaulle failed to keep his undertaking. At his first meeting with &quot;the Minister of State in Cairo, he adopted an,offensive and intransigent attitudeover Syrian questions. When&apos; he reached Syria he renewed his old tactics ofinciting his officers and officials against the British. Fie indulged in a violentoutburst against British methods and imperialist designs in the Middle East in conversation with the United States Consul-General at Beirut, which causedmuch uneasiness in the State Department. He dismayed the National Committeein London by informing them that the British were planning to obtain completedomination of Syria and the Lebanon. He also complained of British interferencewith the Free French Forces in the Levant, and even demanded that the supreme command of the Allied forces there should be transferred from the British to theFree French.,23. To stop this mischief His Majesty&apos;s Government invited de Gaulle toreturn to London for consultation. He at first declined to do so. Meanwhile,the negotiations with the Governor-General of Madagascar had broken down,
and by the middle of September the whole of Madagascar had been occupied byBritish forces. De Gaulle was insistent that the island should be handed overforthwith to the National Committee, but we made it clear to him that, although we wished to do this subject to adequate safeguards for British strategic interests, we were not disposed to proceed further in the matter so long asde Gaulle continued to make trouble for us in Syria. Our threat sufficed to bringde Gaulle back to London at the end of September. Negotiations were startedfor a comprehensive settlement of outstanding differences in the Levant, and,although progress was slow, de Gaulle retracted sufficiently from his intransigent, attitude of the previous month to make it possible to open negotiationsconcurrently for the handing over of Madagascar. These were protracted, partly owing to the reluctance of the Free French to meet our military requirements, andpartly because we did not want to have the Free French established inMadagascar before we knew de Gaulle&apos;s reaction to the impending operations in north Africa. The Madagascar Agreement was finally signed on the14th December.VII. North Africa and the progress towards French unity.   November 1942-June 1943.24. In accordance with American policy de Gaulle, was not informed inadvance of the North African operation. He deeply resented this treatment.In public, however, he rose to the occasion well, made no reproaches, and on the evening of the 8th November welcomed the Anglo-American action in a broadcastappeal to Frenchmen. The understanding with Darlan, the retention of Vichyelements and the continued persecution of de Gaullists disgusted him, but he held the Americans rather than ourselves responsible.25. When Giraud succeeded Darlan on the 26th December, an earlyunderstanding between him and the National Committee seemed possible. Thefirst step was to get the two Generals to meet and the Anfa Conference provided agood opportunity for this. Accordingly the President and the Prime Ministerinvited both Generals to meet them. Giraud agreed readily, but de Gaulle,although prepared for a meeting in principle (he had already suggested one toGiraud) did not want it to take place under Anglo-American auspices. he regarded his dealings with Giraud as a French internal matter and revolted at theidea of conducting them under outside pressure. He therefore madeevery sort of difficulty about going to Anf a. He actually said : &quot;If the President wants tosee me, I could always call upon him in America, nor could there be any invitation to me to meet anybody on French soil.&quot; He only undertook the journey afterthe Prime Minister had threatened to throw him over if he did not. When therehis behaviour was arrogant and intractable, contrasting badly with that ofGiraud, and serious progress towards an agreement was rendered impossible.The President and the Prime Minister were much incensed by his conduct, andafter his return the Prime Minister gave him to understand that he did not wishto have any more personal dealings with him, although His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould continue as before to treat with the National Committee.26. During the protracted negotiations between de Gaulle and Giraud,which occupied March, April and May. our relations with de Gaulle were againdisturbed by the persistence of Free French propaganda against the Frenchleaders in North and West Africa and against the policy of the United States.This caused protests to us from the United States Government, and it was difficult to convince the Americans that we were really unable to stop it, sincede Gaulle remained dependent on us financially. Massigli, to whom we madestrong representations, deplored the propaganda, but was powerless to stop it,and there is little doubt that those responsible acted with de Gaulle&apos;s approval.De Gaulle has also caused us trouble by his claim to be the sole voiee of france in respect of S.O.E. work in France and other preparations for the Alliedinvasion.27. By the end of May the two Generals had agreed on the basis of asettlement and de Gaulle reached Algiers on the 30th May. The French Committeefor National Liberation was established on the 3rd June. Then followed thedispute about the military command, which led to General Eisenhower&apos;sintervention of the 19th June. This roused de Gaulle to fresh indignation againstthe Americans and ourselves (he knew that General Eisenhower had acted withthe approval of both Governments) not only because of his exclusion from military
control in North Africa, but also because he regarded the intervention as an infringement of French sovereignty. It seemed at one moment as if de Gaullemight withdraw from the Algiers Committee altogether, but the storm blew overwhen the Committee adopted the compromise of a geographical division of themilitary command between the two Generals. De Gaulle did not, however, allowhis resentment at the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to affect either his personal relations with the Resident Minister or his public professions of friendship towards Great Britain. Mr. Macmillan found him usually ready tounburden himself frankly, if bitterly, even at the height of the crisis. In a speech at Tunis a week after his interview with General Eisenhower he declaredthat Great Britain had saved the whole world in 1940.28. His various successes in chasing out American proteges in the North-West African theatre and his struggle to obtain command or control of the french army deeply angered the&quot; President and the State Department. The extrusion ofBoisson was a dear-bought victory for de Gaulle and aroused the fierce resentmentof the President.  We have done our best to smooth things down.Foreign Office, 8th July, 1943.
