Printed for- the War Cabinet.   May 1944.secret copy No.W.P. (44) 273.26th May, 1944./WAR CABINET.INTERNATIONAL CONTROL OF SHIPPING AFTER THE liberation of europe the Armistice and Post-War Committee have considered proposals* putforward by the Minister of War Transport on two important points which haveemerged from the discussions with the United States Government of our plant for providing for continued and effective control of shipping under all flagsduring the period^after the termination of hostilities in Europe.2. The first point concerns the precise form of control to be exercised by each Government over its own ships. The United States Government wish to bind all the Governments subscribing to the plan to the maintenance of the mechanism of full requisition. The Minister of War Transport proposes thatthis should be accepted, as full requisition is the only effective method of control,particularly in the case of the minor Allies.3. The second point concerns the time limit to the international control.The United States Government wish to establish a minimum period, of control which would last up to six months after the end of the Japanese war. TheMinister of War Transport proposes that this six months&apos; period should bethe maximum, as he considers that the minor Allies, whose participation in theplan is essential to its success, are more likely to agree to a maximum than aminimum period of control. He also estimates that our own shipping industry should be in a position to take its full and proper place in normal trade at theend of this si-x months&apos; period.4. The Minister of War &apos; Transport has emphasised that the acceptanceof his proposals on these two points would - commit us only in regard to thecontrol of our shipping in relation to other nations, and would be entirely withoutprejudice to the decisions to be reached in due course on our domestic post-war shipping policy.5. On this understanding, and after full consideration, the Armistice and post-War Committee have expressed their agreement with  the Minister of WarTransports proposals, and submit them to the War Cabinet for approval.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.(Intd.)C.

ANNEX I.International Control of Shipping after the Liberation of Europe.1. In February the Foreign Secretary and I submitted a proposal to the ministerial Committee on Armistice Terms and Civil Administration(A.C.A. (44) 7), and obtained their approval for a plan designed to provide for continued and effective control of shipping under all flags during the period after the termination of hostilities in Europe until the tasks necessary for, andarising out of, the war in Europe and the Far East have &quot;been fulfilled. this plan has since been submitted to the United States Government, and negotiations are now proceeding with the aim of agreeing with them proposals for jointsubmission to the other United Nations concerned. It is vital to bind those other allies who control substantial amounts of shipping to the obligations which willin any case devolve upon us; and we are anxious to open this matter with them at a very early date.2. The objects of our proposals were described in the Paper submitted tothe Ministerial Committee on Armistice Terms and Civil Administration. Wehave to keep primarily in mind the point therein made (paragraph 6) that, aswe are in fact obliged, by our full participation in the Japanese war and by our other commitments as a leading Power, to keep our shipping under control andengaged upon essential tasks, we cannot afford to see shipping under other flagsfree from direction in the common interest.3. Our plan has been welcomed in the United States, and we have enlistedmuch goodwill in important quarters by putting it forward. There are two important points emerging from the discussions, however, upon which I think should report: (i) In our plan the precise form of control to be exercised by each Govern-ment over its own ships, to ensure their effective co-operation, was left to each government to decide. The United States Government wish to bind us, and themselves, to maintaining the mechanism of requisition for this purpose (as distinct from, say, control of voyages by direction or licence). Provided that allthe other Governments whose ships would be concerned can be bound by the sameobligation, I do not think we need resist the United States for these reasons : (a) I am bound to agree that requisition by Governments has proved the only effective and satisfactory way of securing control. ,(b) I am satisfied that requisition by other Governments of their shipping(particularly some of the European Allies) is the most, and probably the only, effective guarantee that their control will be effective.(c) To resist the United States view may give the impression that we wish to weaken our obligation to use our shipping to the full extent necessaryin the Japanese war.To put it another way, while I should prefer to keep our hands free tocontrol our own shipping in the way that suits us best, I think that it is worthwhile sacrificing that freedom in exchange for securing (a) effective control overthe ships of the European Allies and (b) the goodwill of the United StatesGovernment.I therefore propose that we should accept the United States view, providedrequisitioning of their ships is a general obligation upon all Governments.As regards British shipping, no new powers will be necessary, but underthe existing agreements British shipowners can claim the release of their vesselsfrom requisition six months after the cessation of hostilities, which may be held to mean six months after the date of ah Armistice with Germany. If theowners take this point of interpretation, there are two possibilities : (a) to persuade owners to agree to the extension of the existing arrangements untilsix months after the conclusion of the war with Japan or, failing this, (b) tore-requisition the ships and negotiate new agreements with owners as to termsof hire and compensation or leave these matters to be settled under the Com-pensation (Defence) Act procedure. *(ii) In our plan we set no precise limit of time to the international control,which was designed to ensure fulfilment of the tasks arising from the war, andto operate until they were completed. The United States Government wish toestablish a minimum period for the plan, so that decontrol would not beginbefore six months after the end of the Japanese war but would begin then unless
otherwise agreed. I consider that our commitments to carry on the war against japan and the full extent of our powers.and our other commitments as a leadingPower may, in fact, oblige us to maintain control over our shipping for sometime after the end of the Japanese war, and it is of advantage, therefore, to bind other flags similarly. I would recommend acceptance of a commitment till,say, six months after the armistice with Japan, as a maximum, with a provision that, if the tonnage situation permits some earlier relaxation, the obligationupon Governments to maintain all their ships under requisition should be relaxedpro tanto on a fair basis all round, on the understanding that such relaxationwould only be by unanimous agreement of the Governments concerned.In effect, this proviso means that relaxation will be possible only when we and the United States are agreed, for the other Governments concerned willprobably be only too anxious to release their ships. While this might appear tobe a surrender of our freedom of action, the fact is that if, before the japanese war is completed, we wished to free some of our shipping, we should not do soagainst the desires of the United States, even if we were not formally bound byagreement with them&apos;in the matter.4. These proposals, which are made to meet the United States wishes, will involve a commitment by His Majesty&apos;s Government, as part of a plan bindingother Governments also, to keep British ships under requisition for a periodof six months after the armistice with Japan, unless there is general agreement among Governments to relax earlier. It would be necessary to announce theultimate decision as soon as possible in view of the present arrangements with british shipowners.(Initialled) L.ANNEX II.Brief Description of a Plan for Co-ordinated Use of Merchant Shipping duringthe Period of Relief and Rehabilitation succeeding the Termination ofHostilities in Europe.1. The provision of shipping for the supply of all liberated areas as wellas of the United Nations generally and territories under their authority and theprovision of shipping for all the military and other tasks necessary for andarising out of the completion of the war should be accepted as a commonresponsibility for all of the United Nations who control ships.2. The Governments of the United Nations (and perhaps some neutral governments, such as that of Sweden, if they are willing to participate) should undertake to maintain such powers of control over their own ships as wouldenable them to direct their use in accordance with the policy of a centralauthority, the International Maritime Administration.3. The Administration might consist of a Council, representing all the participating Governments and two small Executive Boards, one in London andone in Washington, comprising only the principal maritime participating Powers.4. The function of the Administration would be to ensure that ships wereavailable for all the essential requirements of each of the United Nations,including military needs and transport of relief supplies, and for other approvedpurposes.5. The International Maritime Executive Boards would work through theshipping authority of each participating country. The shipping authority mightallocate ships under its own control wholly or partly to cover import require-^ ments of the territories for which its Government has special shippingresponsibilities. Ships not so allocated would be allocated in accordance with thedecisions of the International Maritime Executive Boards to meet the demandsnot met by the allocations of the shipping authorities. The Boards would alsobe able to recommend any adjustments of the amount of tonnage allocated by theshipping authorities of participating countries which might be necessary toensure the fulfilment of all the essential requirements of the United Nations.6. The International Maritime Executive Boards would also determine the remuneration to be paid by the user of the. ship for particular shipping services,so that ships of all flags performing the same or similar services would charge the same freights. The general object would be that ships could be employed as required without regard to financial considerations.
7. The decisions of the International Maritime Executive Boards affectingshipping under the control of any participating country would be reached inconsultation with and with the consent of the shipping authority of that country.8. Control over enemy ships would be exercised by the Executive Boardsthrough the authorities administering the Terms of Surrender.9. Neutral ships not under the control of participating countries would be controlled by measures on the lines of the British and American Ship WarrantSchemes, in accordance with the decisions of the International MaritimeExecutive Boards. .10. No elaborate new machinery would be necessary. The experiencedpersonnel and the organisations of the Ministry of War Transport and war shipping Administration, acting in close relationship with foreign shippingmissions with which they have been associated in the war, would in practiceperform the functions of the Executive Boards. (These functions would becomparable to those now exercised by the Ministry of War Transport and war shipping Administration.)11. Somewhat looser arrangements would be necessary to direct theemployment of ships engaged in the short trades between countries, for example,between the United Kingdom and the neighbouring continental countries; butthe principles of the scheme would apply also to such ships.12. The scheme would apply to all types of merchant ships, including whalefactories. The scheme might also be extended, through suitable machinery, toapply to fishing vessels,&apos; whale catchers and other similar craft to the extent necessary to provide an authority capable of apportioning such craft availablein certain areas between naval and commercial service,13. The Administration should be constituted at such time as would enable it to commence effective operation on the general cessation of hostilities inEurope.14. Detailed proposals have been considered on all these points for submission- to the Allied Governments if the general principles proposed meet with approval.
