SECRET.W.P. (44) 230.30th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.TEMPORARY EMBARGO ON BUILDING.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.1. A temporary building embargo was imposed as at the 8th April(W.P. (44) 182) so as to reduce the load to be carried by the railways during the peak of the operational period.2. In W.P. (44) 237 I said it would be necessary to continue the embargofor at least another month, and I undertook to review the position before theend of May.3. I have discussed, the situation with the Minister of War transport and he agrees with me that although relief has been secured by the operationof the embargo in April and May, it would be unwise to relax for the presentthe strict restriction of traffic now in force.4. I have also consulted the Minister of Works. As provided in theoriginal proposal, various new projects related to forthcoming operations ordesigned to increase impact on the enemy in 1944 have been permitted to proceed,In certain other cases where it has been established that there will be no appre-appreciable strain on transport and immobile building labour is available, authorityto proceed with essential work has been given. A number of cases which were permitted were projects approved before the embargo but for which contractshad not been let.5. I propose therefore to continue the embargo for a further month and to review the matter before the end of June. The Minister of Works concurswith this.O. L.Great George Street, S.W. 1,. 30th May, 1944.[27546]Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.
