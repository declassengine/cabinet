(44) 254.IQth May, 1944.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR EMPLOYMENT.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.I attach a draft of a White Paper outlining a policy for maintaining employ-ment after the war.2. This Paper is based on the Report of a Committee of officials, under thechairmanship of Sir Richard Hopkins, which was appointed by the Recon-struction Priorities Committee on the 31st May, 1943. Their Report (R (44) 6)was presented in January of this year, and its recommendations have since then been exhaustively discussed by the Reconstruction Committee.The Paper thus represents the results of more than a year&apos;s work by officials and Ministers. Subject to the one point mentioned in the following paragraph,it has the unanimous support of the Reconstruction Committee.3. The Committee, in authorising me to submit this Paper on their behalfto the War Cabinet, have asked me to draw special attention to paragraph 72of the draft. On this question of varying rates of taxation for the purpose ofmaintaining employment, there is still some difference of opinion among membersof the Committee. Some Ministers, feel that more might be claimed for this method of sustaining expenditure at the onset of a depression. Others areimpressed by the political dangers of such a method, and would have preferred that the Paper should include no reference to it. The paragraph, as drafted,is put forward as a compromise between the conflicting views which have been expressed on this question.4. If the policy outlined in this Paper is approved by the War Cabinet,there are special reasons (which I will explain verbally) why the Paper shouldbe presented to Parliament at an early date. , If possible, I should like to beable to present it before the Whitsuntide Recess; and I understand that themost suitable date for publication would be Wednesday, the 24th May.W.4 Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.lQth May, 1944,[27471]

EMPLOYMENT POLICYFOREWORDThe Government accept as one of their primary aims and responsibilitiesthe maintenance of a high and stable level of employment after the war.This Paper outlines the policy which they propose to follow in pursuit of thataim.A country will not suffer from mass unemployment so long as the total demand for its goods and services is maintained at a high level. But in thiscountry we are obliged to consider external no less than internal demand.The Government are therefore seeking to create, through collaboration betweenthe nations, conditions of international trade which will make it possible forall countries to pursue policies of full employment to their mutual advantage.The discussions which have been undertaken to this end are briefly mentionedin Chapter I of this Paper.If by these means the necessary expansion of our external trade can bessured, the Government believe that widespread unemployment in this country can be prevented by a policy for maintaining total internal expenditure.The measures by which such expenditure will be influenced are described in chapters IV and V.There will, however, be no problem of general unemployment in the years immediately after the end of the war in Europe. In this transition periodour problems, though no less difficult, will be different. It will be a periodof shortages. Though there will be risk of unemployment due to the dislocation-tion involved in the gradual change from war to peace, the total man-power available will be insufficient to satisfy the total demand for goods and services.It is likely to be some time before the need arises to put into operation thelong-term policy for averting mass unemployment which is described in chapters IV and V. The Paper therefore deals first, in Chapters II and III,with the special problems of the transition period and the measures to betaken for preventing local unemployment by securing a balanced distributionof industry and labour.Unlike other Papers on post-war problems which the Government have presented or are preparing, this is not primarily an outline of projectedlegislation. For employment cannot be created by Act of Parliament or by government action alone. The Government can help to bring about condi-tions favourable to the maintenance of a high level of employment; and somelegislation will be required to confer powers which are needed for that purpose.But the success of the policy outlined in this Paper will ultimately dependon the understanding and support of the community as a Whole andespecially on the efforts of employers and workers in industry, who mustprogressively improve their efficiency if we are to secure a high level ofemployment combined with a rising standard of living.
I. THE INTERNATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL BACKGROUNDI. This Paper is concerned with the course of policy which the. Govern-ment propose to follow internally in order to maintain the highest possible level of employment. But the level of employment and the standard ofliving which we can maintain in Great Britain do not depend only uponconditions within our own country. We must continue to import fromabroad a large proportion of our foodstuffs and raw materials, and to agreater extent than ever before we shall have to pay for them by the exportof our goods and services. For as the result of two world wars we havehad to sacrifice by far the greater part of the foreign investments whichwe built up over many years when we were the leading creditor country of the world. It will not, therefore, be enough to maintain the volume ofour pre-War exports; we shall have to expand them greatly.2. A country dependent on exports and relying largely, as we do, on theexport of manufactured goods of high quality needs prosperity in its oversetmarkets. This cannot be achieved without effective collaboration among thenations. It is therefore an essential part of the Governments employment policy to co-operate actively with other nations, in the first place for there-establishment of general economic stability after the shocks of the war,and next for the progressive expansion of trade.3. The aims of this international co-operation are to promote the beneficialexchange of goods and services between nations, to ensure reasonably stablerates ot exchange, and to check the swings in world commodity prices whichalternately inhale and destroy the incomes of the primary producers of food-stuffs and raw materials. It will also be necessary to arrange that countrieswhich are faced with temporary difficulties in their balance of payments shallbe able to take exceptional measures to regulate their imports and also to callon other nations, as good neighbours, to come to their help, so that their difficulties may be eased without recourse to measures which would per-manently arrest the flow of international trade.4. The Government have already given proof of their intentions. Theyhave signed the Atlantic Charter. They have made a Mutual Aid Agreementwith the Government of the United States of America, * one of the chief aims of which is &quot; agreed action directed to the expansion, by appropriate inter-national and domestic measures, of production, employment and the exchange and consumption of goods.&quot; They have also declared their acceptance ofthe comprehensive recommendations made to the Governments and authorities of forty-four nations by the United Nations Conference on Food and Agricultureheld at Hot Springs in 1943, in so far as those recommendations are applicableto conditions in the United Kingdom. One of those recommendationsfrecognises that &apos;&apos; the promotion of the full employment of human and material sources, based on sound social and economic policies, is the first conditionof a general and progressive increase in production and purchasingpower. . . . Progress by individual nations towards a higher standard ofliving contributes to the solution of broader economic problems, but freedom from want cannot be achieved without effective collaboration among nations.&quot;The Government are considering, with the Governments of others &quot;of theUnited Nations, how these general agreements regarding the common ends ofinternational economic policy can best be carried out in practice. For thispurpose they are working in close consultation with the Governments of theDominions and of India; for the early renewal of the economic strength ofthe British Commonwealth of Nations and the economic development of our* Qmd. 6341, 1942.   Part of Article VII.t cmd. 6451.   Resolution XXIV.   Achievement of an Economy of Abundance.
Colonial dependencies are among the substantial contributions we can make to stability in the world&apos;s economic order. The Government will also colla-borale with other Governments in considering how effect may be given tothe principles and recommendations recently put forward by the International&apos;Labour organisation. Further reports on all these matters will be made toParliament in due course.5. While the Government will spare no effort to create, in collaboration with other Governments, conditions favourable to the expansion of our exporttrade, it is with industry that the responsibility and initiative must- rest for making the most of their opportunities to recover their export markets andto find fresh outlets for their products. In the interest of the whole national economy, our export industries must be resilient and flexible; and in the period immediately after the end of the war their claims for raw materials, labourand factory space freed from war purposes must have a high priority.1^6. Though there will be special reasons for giving &apos;this measure of earlypriority to the export trades, the need for increased efficiency in industryis in no way limited to those trades. To maintain and improve our standardof living there must be steady progress in- the efficiency of our industry asa whole. During the war British industry has amply demonstrated its &quot;power-to improve the technique of its production, and this improvement must continue if we are to solve the problems of the post-war years. TheGovernment have been considering, as part of their general reconstructionplans, what help they can give to this end. The Chancellor of the exchequer has already announced in his Budget speech the means by which taxationpolicy will be adapted to foster the development of industrial research, andto facilitate the modernisation of industrial plant, machinery and buildings.These important modifications in the incidence of taxation on industry will&apos;,make a substantial contribution towards industrial recovery after the war andwill pave the way for&apos; a continuous technical advance throughout &quot;Britishindustry. The means of promoting industrial efficiency will be kept under constant review- other proposals to this end are already under examination and the Government will continue from time to time to report their conclusionsor present their proposals to Parliament on this subject.      &apos;       &apos;    \7. The earlier paragraphs of this Chapter, which were concerned with thebalance of payments.and the export trades, referred mainly to.the manufac-turing industries. In the remainder of this Paper the term &quot; industry &quot; -is usedin its widest sense to cover all the manifold activities which provide employ-ment. Thus, it includes, not only the manufacturing and processing industries,but the industries providing raw.materials and primary products, such as agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining, services such as. shipping, inland transport and the distributive trades, and all the varied activities of commerce.The prosperity of a particular industry depends partly on circumstancespeculiar to that industry and partly on the general economic condition ofthe country. This Paper sets forth the Government&apos;s policy for securinggeneral conditions favourable to a high level of employment throughout industry as a whole. In addition, special measures may be taken from timeto time which are directed to the circumstances of particular industries. TheGovernment have, for example, declared their determination to ensure that weshall have in this country after the war a healthy and well-balanced agri-culture; and the special measures needed &apos;to secure this are how being discussed with representatives of the industry. This Paper does not deal withspecial measures which are peculiar to a particular industry. But all alikewill benefit from the general policy which it describes; for, to the extent thatthis policy succeeds in maintaining a high level of employment, it will sustain the demand for goods and services of all kinds. .       .   .    :    :..
II. THE TRANSITION FROM WAR TO PEACE^8..- After the end of the war with Germany, the war with Japan will continueto have first call on our resources of man-power and materials. There will,however, &quot;be some redistribution of man-power which will release labour for urgent civilian work. At this point we shall enter a period of unsettledeconomic conditions, which are likely to last until some time after the endof war with Japan. The plans for this transition period must be extremelyflexible; for no one can yet know when the war with Germany will come to anend or how long thereafter Japanese resistance will continue.,9. During the present war, as during the last, unemployment has shrunkto-negligible proportions. In April, 1944, the figure was 75,000; whereas; during, the :years between the wars if varied between one and three millions.*The. reasons for this improvement are obvious. The call of the armed forces for men and munitions is limited only by the availability of labour and*other physical resources, There could therefore be no question of demanSrfalling short of the level necessary to employ all available resources. Onthe contrary, steps have had to be. taken to hold demand in check and toprevent a runaway rise of prices by such means as high taxation and encouragement of war savings, rationing of food and clothing, allocation ofmaterials, control over the employment of labour and direct control of prices.10. At the present time we have about 23 million people gainfullyemployed-an increase of 3 millions since 1939. Within this total there has,been an enormous transfer of man-power to the Armed Forces, Civil defence and the munitions industries. At the same time, within industry, there hasbeen a very large change-over from civilian production and services, to, more direct war needs. Something like 80 per cent, of employment in the manu-facturing industries is now on Government account. During the transition from war to peace these movements will be reversed. There will be botha reduction in the total man-power employed and a substantial movement from the Forces and war work to civilian production and services. Thenumbers involved in this change-over may be in the region of 7 millions.In many cases the transfer will not involve any change of employment;substantial numbers in the munitions industries will be re-employed by thesame firm as soon as its plant can be turned over to production for civilianneeds. But large numbers will have to change their present occupations andtheir place of employment, including not only members of the Armed Forcesbut many workers now employed on tasks such as shell filling, to which thereis no peace-time parallel, and those who will have, to make room for themen and women returning from the Forces to their pre-war jobs.11. Side by side with the gradual release of this great labour force, there^will be a vast transformation in the demand for the products of labour.* After the last war there. were a few months of dislocation and unemployment,while industries were switching, over from.war to peace. There then followed the briefbut violent boom (which,reached its peak in the summer of 1920) while stocks were beingrebuilt, war arrears of maintenance made good and the accumulated demands of foreign,countries satisfied. Unemployment was very low, and prices and wages .soared. As soonas: demand at home and, abroad slackened towards: the end of 1.920, prices began toslunipi Deflation followed inflation, with disastrous results. Wage reductions led towidespread industrial unrest. There, was a startling increase in unemployment,, which reached if millions in March, 1921, and rose to 2J millions about the middle of that year,owing largely to a shortage of fuel Caused by a stoppage of work in the coal mining industry. From this figure unemployment gradually fell to the neighbourhood of ijmillions and (apart from the coal dispute in 1926) stayed at about this level from 1923to, 1929.. With the onset of the great depression, at. the end. of 1929,; unemploymentmounted to over 2 J millions,in just^over one iyear and did not fall below that figureuntil-the middle of 1933, after which we had a steadydecline to under i  millions inthe middle of 1937. :;     - &apos; -  &apos;
Government expenditure on aircraft, warships and munitions, will naturallycontract, though the needs of the Armed Forces are likely to remain highfor a considerable time; on the other hand, the pent-up demand for civiliangoods of all kinds will be released. There will be an immense need for allthe things we have had to go short of during the war.* There will be houses to be built, shops to be filled, factories to be transformed, plant and rolling-stock to be replaced and exports of all kinds to be renewed and extended.12. If this switch of demand could be immediately matched by a corres-ponding switch of supply, there would be no need to fear the occurrence of unemployment in the period immediately after the war! But of course&quot;this cannot happen in practice, even though the war against Japan con-tinues after the defeat of Germany and, as a result, there is a more gradualre^allocation of labour to civilian tasks. Of the millions of men andwomen who will have to find new jobs on release from the Armed Forces,teivil defence and the munitions industries, not all can be released in the*areas where the immediate&apos; demand for their labour is greatest, nor willall those who are released have the special skills to fit them for the peace-time tasks available. Moreover, for a time, shortage of key workers or ofparticular raw materials or types of equipment may delay the full re-employment of all the labour released. New designs have to be created and approved; factories need to be re-tooled or re-opened; semi-manufactureshave to be produced before full manufacture can begin; the skilled labour which is needed for one set of processes cannot immediately be reconstitutedby the release of skilled labour from others. Peace-time production, like war production, will necessarily take some time to get fully into its stride.13. There will be inherent in the situation a threefold danger: -(a) that patches of unemployment may develop where the industrialsystem fails to adapt itself quickly enough to. peace-time production;(b) that demand may outrun supply and create an inflationary rise inprices;(c) that civilian production, when it is resumed, may concentrate on the wrong things from the point of view of national needs.Government action will be directed to forestall, so far as possible, each ofthese dangers.14. It would be vain to imagine that patches of unemployment can be eliminated altogether in the transition period; but they should not be sowidespread or so persistent as is sometimes feared. After the last war thenumber of ex-Service men claiming out-of-work donation never rose sub-stantially above 400,000, although demobilisation was proceeding at anaverage rate of nearly 700,000 a month in the first quarter of &quot;1919. The totalnumber of unemployed persons rose to over a million at one time in 1919,but this figure was soon reduced to a low level and remained low until theend of 1920. It is unlikely that the change from war to peace will be anything like so abrupt this time. The Government are, however, making prepara-tions to reduce the resulting unemployment to a minimum: :(a) by. assisting firms to prepare to switch over their capacity to peace)-..  time.production as quickly as possible;, .x*-w..* The. present clothing ration provides roughly:, one-half of the pre-war consumptionof clothing. . Supplies of household goods have t also been&apos;greatly reduced. Only about one household in-ten can now buy a pair of sheets: and one  household in five.. ,a :pairof blankets each.year. Only one person in seven-can now buy each year a knife, -fork orspoon, one person in three a kettle, saucepan or frying pan, one. person in four a teapotor jug.: .The manufacture of carpets, vacuum cleaners, refrigerators and other, householdappliances is virtually prohibited. 1      ... ;.j
(b) by finding out in advance where the skilled labour which will gradu-ally become available for civilian work&apos;will be most urgently required;(c) by arranging, so far as war conditions permit, that labour and rawmaterials will be forthcoming for urgent civilian work and ensuring thatthe machinery of allocation devised in war-time, will be adaptable to thespecial conditions likely to obtain after the war in Europe ends;(d) by arranging, so far as possible, that curtailments of munitions pro-duction shall take place in areas where the capacity and labour can be usedfor civilian products of high priority;(e) by arranging that the disposal of surplus Government stocks shall not prejudice the re-establishment and development of the normal trade channelsfor producing and distributing similar goods;(/) by regulating the disposal of Government factories in such a way as to help towards the early restoration of employment.15. The Government are already working out plans, based on the use the above methods, to promote the orderly expansion of peace-time industries .throughout the transition period. (The priorities to be applied in the earlier stages of the period are outlined in paragraph 18 below.) These plans havebeen helped by experience gained in the large-scale shifts from one type ofwar production to another which have been carried out with success in thelast two years. Their guiding principle is to secure, so far as possible, that labour and capacity no longer needed for munitions production shall be usedfor producing civilian goods of high priority; and that releases of premises,,labour and material are co-ordinated in advance so as to reduce local or temporary unemployment to the minimum. Discussions have already beenheld with many of the industries concerned, in order to&apos; find out what difh-culties individual industries and firms expect to meet in switching over to peace-time production and absorbing men and women released from the, Services and from other war work.16. The second danger will come when people relax from the discipline and strain of war, and look round. for opportunities to spend the moneythey have saved and to make up for their years of self-denial. If therewere then a scramble to buy, while there was still a shortage of goods, prices would rise. This would mean an inflationary boom bringing with it thesocial injustice and economic disturbance which inevitably accompany in-flation.If, therefore, we are to restore civilian production and to maintain employ-ment we must enter the post-war period with a firm determination to keepstability in the general level of prices. This cannot be secured by theGovernment alone; there must be continued public support for policy onthe following lines:  (a) Rationing and a measure of price control must be continued fore/iisome time.   Increases in rations of manufactured goods, such as clothing,will be regulated to correspond with, increases in production.   The speedat which food rations can be increased and varied will largely depend onthe extent to which we can obtain oversea supplies.(&amp;) Price control cannot; be effective-unless it is accompanied by a stable/general level of costs*. If all will work together to keep the internal level of costs down, it should be possible to aVdid any sharp rise in the cost of living.No undertaking can be given so far in advance to peg the cost of living index to any particular figure by Government subsidies; for one, important&quot;factor in our internal.; price level, he. tiie cost of our imports, will&apos;depend upon the future level of world prices, which cannot be forecast.   But,97.0&apos;K;;.:. \&apos;&apos; * This is discussed more fully in Chapter .iv(6) below;   &apos; -.&quot;      &quot;&quot;( . -
generally, the Government, if supported by the co-operation, of all sectionsof the public, will continue their present policy of providing subsidies to!i prevent temporary and considerable rises in the cost of living.(c) The habit of saving, must still,be encouraged.   Unless people are, still prepared to go on putting aside some part of their earnings,in sayings,instead of spending it on consumption goods, labour and capacity, which is needed for schemes of post-war reconstruction and social development willhave to be diverted to increasing the supplies of consumption goods. ,(d) The use of capital will have to be controlled to the extent necessaryto regulate the flow and direction of investment.   Heavy arrears of capital, expenditure on buildings, plant and equipment have to be overtaken, and construction on new development must/begin. Without control, therefore,there would be a scramble to borrow, leading to a steep rise in rates of1 interest. The Government are determined to avoid dear money for theseurgent. reconstruction heeds. In this period, therefore, access to- theQ  capital market will have to be controlled in order to ensure the properpriorities.17. It cannot be expected that the public, after years of war-time restric- -tions, will find these proposals altogether palatable; and the Governmenthave no intention of maintaining war-time restrictions for restriction^ sake.But they are resolved that, so long as supplies are abnormally short, the most urgent needs shall be met first. Without some of the existing controls this could not be achieved; prices would rise and the limited supplies would go,not to those whose need was the greatest, but to those able to pay the highestprice. The Government are confident that the public will continue to give, for as long as.is necessary, the same wholehearted support to the policy of &quot;fairshares &quot; that it has given in war-time. &apos;5 118. The third danger is that production of unessential goods may interferewith the production of essentials. In order to direct the efforts of industrytowards the right tasks in the right order, it will be necessary to establishcertain broad priorities and to enforce them for a time by means of the issueof licences, the allocation of raw materials and some measure of control overthe labour and staff required for industry. There are three main reasons why this must be done:  (a) During the war we have obtained a large proportion of our importsfirst by the sale of our foreign assets and later by lend-lease or on credit.This process cannot continue indefinitely; and if we are to be able to buy the imported food and raw materials which we, need to. maintain ourstandard of. life, we must expand our export trade. An export drive is thus of paramount importance, and home demand--whether for consump-tion goods or capital expenditure must not be allowed to divert the resourcesneeded for exports. ::; s&amp;(&amp;) Production for the home market must be directed in the first placetowards the necessities of civilian life and, until these primary heeds: are met, resources which could be applied to meet them should not be diverted to the production of luxuries for home consumption.       ;&apos;.        .&quot;.     -(c) Production of the capital goods needed, to restart arid re-equip iridus-&apos; try at the highest pitch of efficiency must be rapidly expanded: ;19, It is not.yet possible to forecast the length of the transition period during, which the prevailing tendency! will be for demand to outrun supply.The need to maintain large armed forces may prolong this period consider-ably; and, although the most pressing shortages may disappear and&apos; themost vexatious controls be relaxed, our main problem for a considerabletrine to come may be, riot to avert mass unemployment, but to secure witha limited labour force an adequate production of the goods needed to improve
xbour.standard of living and to increase our exports. The immediate difficulties for bur external trade will&apos;be&apos; serious. We may be struggling to restore burexports while we are still at war with&apos;Japan and liable to provide help forthe liberated territories. We shall, therefore, be compelled during this period to regulate imports and to manage.our exchange resources with great care.On the other hand, the recuperative powers of modern productive techniqueare very strong. Under favourable external conditions, it may not be very long before production becomes adequate to meet the various calls upon it.When that happens, the first aim. of employment policy the maintenanceof an adequate level of expenditure on goods, and services will no longer berealised automatically, as a by-product of the war effort or of reconstruction,but will call for the application of a policy deliberately directed to that end.III. THE BALANCED DISTRIBUTION OF INDUSTRY AND LABOUR^20. Before proceeding (in Chapters IV and V) to describe the long-term?policy proposed for maintaining total expenditure, it is necessary to turn asidefrom the main argument of the Paper to describe the measures which theGovernment will take to check the development of localised unemploy-ment in particular industries and.areas. Although their effect will continue formany years thereafter, these measures will begin to operate in the transition period and can therefore be described most conveniently at this point in thePaper. r21. Apart.from temporary unemployment due to the seasonal and otherirregularities in particular trades, patches of longer-term unemploymentdevelop in particular industries and areas when the demand for their productsis insufficient to provide work for the whole of their labour force. This isdue to a temporary or a permanent decline in an industry or group ofindustries caused by technical change, the trend of fashion, or the growth offoreign competition.22. Unemployment of this type was a familiar feature in this country&apos;economic life between the wars. The industries affected were mainly exporttrades such as cotton and coal and some of the heavy industries which hadbeen greatly expanded during the last war. Areas which were largely dependentupon depressed industries showed heavy unemployment percentages, not onlyin the basic industries, but in subsidiary local trades and occupations as well.23. The suffering in these areas was enhanced by their lack of a properindustrial balance. Ah area may be industrially unbalanced either because it is over-dependent upon a single industry or group of industries which tendto fluctuate together; or because it is predominantly concerned with theexport trade, which is especially liable to sudden fluctuations not withinthe control of our internal policy; or because it contains industries which provide employment mainly for men or mainly for women; or because itsindustries are: subject to&apos; unpredictable: changes in demand;; dependence on a single industry and the subsidiary industries which grow up round itis a natural form of industrial development which has in the past&apos;enabledcertain areas to reach the highest peak of temporary prosperity: while circum--stances were&apos; favourable. Shipbuilding and the heavy industries in the indus-trial belt of Scotland, coal and iron in South Wales arid cotton in. Lancashireare examples. But the price-to&quot; -bei paid for such temporary, prosperityis high when the period of depression comes. A region like South Wales inthe early &apos;20s, with half its-workers, employed&apos;in getting coal, rthree-fifths ofwhich was shipped overseas, was dangerously dependent upon foreign trade.Conversely, &quot;regions with a wide range of industrial skills, like Birmirigharh,have been able to see many of their old industries die away during the past
half century without losing their general prosperity, because they have hadthe resilience to develop new activities to replace those which became obsolete.24. The first line of attack on the problem of unemployment in-these un-balanced areas must be to promote the-prosperity of the basic industries onwhich they primarily depend, i.e. coal, steel, engineering and ship-building. It will be a primary aim of Government policy to help these industries to reach the highest possible pitch of efficiency; and secure overseamarkets. &apos; &apos; - &apos;Secondly, these industries, and the areas which are largely dependent on them, will share in the benefits which will flow from the Governments policy(explained in Chapters IV and V) for maintaining domestic expenditure ata high level. But it will not be enough to rely on the general maintenance of purchasing power to solve all the problems of local unemployment. A solution on these lines alone would be too long drawn out and might involve the.partialdepopulation of industrial regions which are a national asset that we cannot afford to lose.25. The Government therefore propose to attack the. problems of localunemployment in three ways:  (a) By so influencing the location of new enterprises as to diversify theindustrial composition of areas which are particularly vulnerable to unem-ployment. .(b) By removing obstacles to the transfer of workers from one area toanother, and from one occupation to another.(c) By providing training facilities to fit workers from declining industries for jobs in expanding industries.Distribution of Industry.26. It will be an object of Government policy to secure a balanced indus-trial development in areas which have in the past been unduly dependent onindustries specially vulnerable to unemployment. The Government will encourage the establishment of new enterprises in these &quot; development areas &quot;by the following means;  (a) Location of new factories. In order that the Government may be fully informed of the course of industrial development, industrialists con-contemplating the establishment of new* factories, or the transfer of a factoryfrom one area to another, will be required to notify the Government before their plans reach an advanced stage. This will enable the Government toexercise a substantial influence over the location of new industrial develop-ment, as contemplated by the Barlow report. On the one hand, power will be taken to prohibit the establishment of a new factory in a districtwhere serious disadvantage would arise from further industrial development.On the other hand, the Government will, be able to use their influence tosteer new factory development into areas which call most urgently for further,industrial: diversification. In exercising this influence account will be taken of strategic, as well as industrial; and social, considerations. In this positiveaspect of their policy, the Government will be prepared, in suitable cases, tooffer to industrialists who are willing to establish new factories in development areas the special inducements indicated below, i* For the purpose of this legislation &quot; new factory &quot; will include extensions of existingfactories, but in framing the definition tfteGoyemrnent. will seek to exclude from the restrictive provisions small establishments and.small extensions of existing establishments;&apos;f Cmd. 6153, 1940.

12(b) Munitions Factories.- Where practicable, factories now engaged - inwar production in these areas will be retained on that work if it is reasonablyclear that they can be employed in the production of munitions after the war.Factories which are not likely to be required for the manufacture of munitionsafter the end of the war will be released as early as possible, and those owned by the Government will be leased or sold for civilian production.(c) New factory building. To the extent that existing factory buildings are insufficient to secure a proper balance of industry in the development areas,the Government will give priority to these areas in the grant of licences forthe building of new factories and extensions of existing factories.(d) Factory Premises for Smaller Firms.-The Government will continue and extend the policy of erecting in development areas factories on individual or collective sites, for sale or lease, &quot;including factories which can be rented in sections-t..... ...-,.(e) Government Contracts__-Due regard will be paid to the needs of thes.feareas in the placing of Government orders of all kinds. &apos;(f) Financial Assistance.- The Government will take such steps as maybe necessary to secure that enterprises which establish themselves in these areas in conformity with the Government&apos;s policy, and show good prospects ofsuccess on a commercial basis, shall have adequate facilities for obtainingshort-term and long-term loans and, where necessary, share capital.27. The Government will also take such action as may be necessary tosecure the full development in these areas of the basic services on whichindustry depends and to stimulate the modernisation of their capital equip-ment, e.g., the. improvement of communications (including docks and harbours,as well as roads and railways), the extension of power services, and theimprovement of housing, other amenities and general public services. Inaddition, the Government will organise research with a view to discoveringwhat types of industry would fit most naturally into the long-term economy of each of these areas.     ...28; The measures required to balance and diversify industry will of coursevary from one area to another, and the areas in which such measures m&amp;y berequired from time to time cannot be foreseen. There can be no final listof &quot; development areas.&quot; Areas which have regained their prosperity bythe aid of these measures will be removed from the list, while others mayhave to be added to it as economic conditions change.29. With the introduction of this new policy for securing a balanced distri-bution of industry, the need for the Special Areas legislation will disappearand steps will be taken for its repeal.The Special Areas are not at present depressed, and experience during thewar has shown that production there can be as efficient as in other parts of thecountry. Much social capital is already invested there in the form of houses,shops, public services, etc. Neither this social capital nor the corporate life of these communities can be sacrificed. There may be some small and isolatedvillages/especially in mining areas, which, owing to permanent changes in industrial conditions, offer no hope of sound economic revival. In these rarecases the. populationmay&quot;have to be re-established elsewhere/ There will be other larger areas where me temporary causes of special industrial prosperityhave disappeared,&apos; e.g.&apos;,L because-&apos;of the exhaustion of a wasting asset, hutwhere the economic life of the community cOuld be put on a sound basis if thepopulation were reduced. &apos; In these special cases some proportion of&apos; theworkers may have to be re-established elsewhere. But where a&quot; large industrial population is involved, the Government are not prepared either to compelits transfer to another tt&amp;^ffi^tf&amp;jfye &quot;li^to prolonged unemployment anddemoralisation. &quot;V-1&apos;-^&apos;- rvs
30- No single Department could conveniently undertake the&apos; responsibilityfor formulating and administering the policy for the distribution of industryoutlined in the foregoing paragraphs. This is essentially a policy of theGovernment as a whole; and its application in practice will involve action by a number of different Departments, each of which will adapt its adminis-tration to conform with the general Government policy. The main responsi-bility will rest with the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Labour and NationalService, the Ministry of Town and Country Planning and the Scottish Office.Standing arrangements will be; made for supervising and controlling, underthe Cabinet and as part of, the central Government machinery, the develop-ment and execution of the policy as a whole. At tire other end of the scale,there will be a Regional organisation, which will bring together the fepre-sentatives of the Departments concerned in the local application of these measures.It is necessary, however, that there should be a single channel through which Government policy on the distribution of industry can be expressed.It would not be satisfactory if the public were left to deal with a numberof different Departments on different aspects of the same problem. TheGovernment therefore propose that the channel for the expression of Govern-ment policy in this matter shall be the Board of Trade, which will be theDepartment responsible for all general questions of industrial policy and willbe suitably strengthened to undertake the heavier responsibilities which government will assume in this field after the war. The President of the Boardof Trade will be responsible to Parliament for all the general aspects of thepolicy; and enquiries and representations from interested sections of the public will be made through the Board of Trade.Distribution, of Labour.31. In an expanding economy workers must be ready and able to movefreely between one occupation and another. This is necessary in order toreduce the dislocation which arises from changes in technique and fluctua-tions in market conditions, and also&apos; to ensure that the expansion, of new industries under the stimulus of a high level of demand is not hampered by a shortage&quot;of skilled labour. During the first year or so after the war theproblems of labour mobility will centre mainly around the re-settlement ofmembers of the Armed Forces released from service and war workers released from war work. The Government have already announced their trainingschemes for re-settling ex-Service men and women and released war workers.As the re-settlement of persons who have been uprooted by war service drawsto a close, the Government propose to continue training schemes on similar lines as a permanent measure, so far as this is needed to assist necessarytransfers from one industry or occupation to another.,32. For   jobs   calling   for  no  great   amount  of   skill  and   requiringonly, a few weeks&apos; instruction, employers should arrange to give the instruc-tion in the course of employment.   No matter,how little skill is involved;in a new job, proper instruction should be given for it and the workershould not be left to pick up the new technique as best he can.  This isa need which can best be met by the development of methods of trainingwithin industry; and does not call forany financial assistance from, public funds.  For jobs calling for greater skill and requiring a more extended periodof specialised instruction, the training should also be carried out as far as/possible by employers.   This type of training is best given under properly-designed., training  schemes .providing. &apos;&apos;a;.^fimfe  course   of instiuction.- Employers,who provide such courses, approved by the appropriate Depajt-^meniwwili.receive Government, grants calculated on a capitation basis to besettled after&apos; consultation with the industry concerned.
There are great advantages in providing training in the factories, where the/trainees can see ahead of them the jobs which they, are, qualifying themselves;;to fill. For certain occupations, however, training can be better given,ina separate school or institution than in employers&apos; workshops. To meetthe need for, this kind of training, which employers cannot provide, thef facilities , for. institutional training which are provided in the Government,Training Centres, Technical Colleges, etc., will, be- developed and extended.,33. It will be a fundamental principle that where re-training is requiredit shall,be provided as soon as it is clear to the Ministry of Labour that the worker is hot likely to be able to resume his&apos; former employment within areasonable time: he will not be expected to wait until he has been umemployed for a long time; before becoming eligible for re-training. This will enable theGovernment to take steps to train the necessary la!bour for new and expanding-trades in time to be available when &quot;the demand for its services matures.&quot;It will also prevent the training schemes from becoming discredited by beingconfined to persons who have been unemployed over a long period and cannot^readily Ibe placed in new employment:34. The allowances granted to the trainees will be completely divorced frompayment of unemployment benefit. The worker entering upon a course oftraining must be made to feel that he has left unemployment and unemploy-ment benefit behind him and has started on a new job. Training allowanceswill be fixed on a higher scale than unemployment benefit, subject, to theprinciple that they should not be so high as to provide a higher income thanthe general run of wages likely to be received by trainees in their first subse-quent employment.35. If retraining schemes are to be a success - there must be the fullestco-operation between employers and the Trade Unions. Difficulties have arisen in the past because some sections of industry have been reluctant to admit trainees. There have been various reasons for these difficulties, includ-ing rules and practices which were devised to safeguard the security ofemployment of existing workers and their wage standards, and to maintain a proper standard of skill. In some cases the difficulty has been increased bycompetition between Unions. During this war causes of friction, includingdemarcation, have been greatly reduced; and the Government believe that,with the creation of conditions designed to produce full employment and stability, all,parties in industry will agree&quot; that existing rules and practicesmay safely be modified to allow the ready admission of trainees, providedthat proper steps, are taken to train them to a standard which will justifythe payment of the recognised rate of, wages. Care will also be taken to&apos; ensure that the number of trainees. does not exceed the number capable ofbeing, absorbed in the particular trade. :36. While the Government do not rely primarily on large-scale labourtransfers for &amp; solution of the ^unemployment problems of particular areas,they are: anxious to overcome some of the obstacles which stand in the way &apos;of the transfer of workers to places where suitable employment is availablefor them.. Experience before the war showed that two of the &apos;rnos&apos;t seriousobstacles were the workeris difficulty in obtaining a suitable house&apos; to rentin areas where work was 1 available;: and the special costs which for a: time fall upon-him-while he is settling down in his new environment. -     &apos;; -ASince the end of the last war, the difficulty of obtaining a house to ,renthas been an especially important &quot;factor. Workers who could-afford andwere anxious to rent houses in/the areas to which they were moving found themselves unable to do so and were forced to buy houses on,.mortgage.Steps will be taken to secure tbaCa substantial proportion of the ;new houses
erected after the war shall be available at a rent which is within the meansof the average wage earner.&apos;      &apos; &apos; : &apos; *   *    *.. Where workers are transferred under approved schemes to a new area/they will be eligible for resettlement allowancs to meet the. costs involvedin &quot;their removal and that of&apos;theiT dependants.   Special arrangements&apos;&apos;\yill&apos;also &apos; be made for the training ahd employment of juveniles -through the juvenile Employment Committees. &apos;      ;&apos; M &apos;&apos; &apos;    &apos; &apos;iv. general conditions of a high and stable levelof Employment37. In the transition period, as we have seen, employment policy will be primarily concerned with the transfer of men and women to peace-time jobs.-But however smoothly this transition can be made, and however, rapid may,be,the return to normal conditions, there will still remain for-treatment those^ng-term problems connected with the maintenance of an adequate and steadyvolume of employment which eluded solution before the war.38. The chart in Appendix I shows unemployment rates for the period1858-1938. Throughout the period there was a fairly regular cycle of unem-ployment evidence of instability in our economic system. And (although the,figures are not strictly comparable throughout the whole, of the period) thelevel of unemployment after the war of 1914-18 was, on account of the special and continuing problems of the export trades, higher than in the period beforeI9I4.....        ....   -.  ..... ,&quot;.39. If these features which have afflicted our economic life in the pastare to be banished, as it is our resolve to banish them, from the future, threeessential conditions must be satisfied:-(a) Total expenditure on goods and services must be prevented from falling to a level where general unemployment, appears. :.       ,- ;(6) The level of prices and wages must be kept reasonably stable.(c) There must be a sufficient mobility of workers between occupations and localities. .. -* .(a) The Maintenance of Total Expenditure40. On a given level of wages and prices, and assuming full mobility oflabour; workers will lose or fail to find employment because there is not a sufficiently large expenditure on the goods and services which they might produce. If more money is spent&apos; on goods and services, then more moneywill be paid out as wages and more people will be employed. Thus, the first step in a policy of maintaining general employment must be to prevent totalexpenditure (analysed in paragraph 43) from falling away.- Once it&apos;is allowedto do so, a minor decline may rapidly gather momentum and take .on the proportions of a major depression. If, for example, there is a decline in thedemand.for steel for the erection of new. buildings,^unemployment wilb firstappear among steel workers. The steel-workers, in consequence, will haveless to spend on food and other. consumer... goods,, so. that the demand forconsumer goods will fall. This leads to. unemployment among the workers inthe consumer goods industries who, ;in ,turn,:l.nnd their purchasing\ powerreduced. As a result of,this general loss of purchasing power in the community,,&apos;the demand for new building is still, further reduced and the demand for cp -structional steel falls once again. The original decline in expenditure producessecondary reactions&apos; which themselves aggravate the source of the trouble.Thisis an bver-simplified illustration;-but it is sufficieht to make it clear that,the crucial -moment for interventioncorrective applied then may arrest the&apos; whole decline&apos;;&quot; once the decline has&quot;
i6spread and gathered momentum, interventions on a much greater scale wouldbe required-and at that stage might not be effective.41. The Government are prepared to accept in future the responsibility &quot;for taking action at the earliest possible stage to arrest a threatened slump. this involves a new approach and a new responsibility for the State. It was atone time believed that every trade depression would automatically bring itsown corrective, since prices and wages would fall, the fall in prices would bring about an increase in demand, and employment would thus be restored.Experience has shown, however,. that under modern conditions this processof self-recovery, if effective at all, is likely to be extremely prolonged andto be accompanied by widespread distress, particularly in a complex industrialcountry like our own.42. The methods which the Government propose to adopt to maintain totalexpenditure are described in Chapter V. &apos; It will, however, be convenient to analyse here the constituent parts of this total expenditure, for they diffejtgreatly both in their susceptibility to fluctuations and in the ease with whicfrthese fluctuations can be controlled.43. In a country which could ignore the outside world these parts wouldbe four in number:--(a) Private Consumption ExpenditurePrivate expenditure on food, clothing, rent, amusements, etc.(b) Public Expenditure on Current ServicesExpenditure by public authorities on education, medical services,national defence, etc,(c) Private Investment Expenditure^-       Private capital  expenditure on buildings,  machinery and otherdurable equipment and on additions to goods in stock.(d) Public Investment Expenditure*Capital expenditure on buildings, machinery, roads and other durableequipment by the central Government, local authorities or public utilities.    vBut in a community linked with the outside world some expenditure (i.e.that upon imports) does not directly lead to employment at home, while some employment at home (i.e. labour engaged in making things for ex-port) arises out of the expenditure of people in other countries. It is con-venient to allow for these facts by adding a fifth item (which may of course bea minus quantity) to the list of the constituents of total expenditure, namely:  .. (e) The Foreign balance the difference between exports (visible and invisible) and imports(visible and invisible).44. Expenditure on private consumption is perhaps the element least liableto sudden and spontaneous variation; for, so long as people&apos;s incomes do not greatly change, their habits of buying are likely to remain much the same.;Public expenditure on current services, including national defence, will.alsobe fairly constant as a rule, unless.the Government decide as an act of deliberate--. *, Strictly speaking, net expenditure in both cases, i.e., after allowing&apos;for expenditureoh&apos; maintenance and renewal of existing&apos;capital equipment and of goods . in stock;. such expenditure, of course, also gives rise to a demand for labour,. Jjtrjt? this . is. alreadyallowed for in the figure of final demand, for the goods, whether capital or consumption&quot;goods, which the equipment is being&apos;used to make, and we must hot count it twice.Indeed, if part of the sums currently set aside for depreciation,: etc.; are not actuallybeing- expended on, renewals.. and. replacements . as , has happened during the war, wemust make, a corresponding deduction from the&apos; expenditure on new equipment inorder-to 1 reach the truel;-&apos;figiire 6f&apos;j&apos;;?&apos;-&apos;net&quot; investment expenditure &quot;/&quot;Similarly, a deduction would have to be made for the depletion&apos;pf stocks in any given period,
ate policy to vary expenditure on- some; iterns in order, to, compensate forswings in other parts of total national expenditure. Public capital expenditure has in the past fluctuated considerably, largely because public authoritieshave often taken the view that in a period of depression, when their revenuewas precarious, economy on capital expenditure was the right policy.45. It is, however, in the two remaining components of total expenditure private expenditure on capital equipment and the foreign balance-thatspontaneous variations are likely to be greatest and at the. same time most difficult to control. A business man deciding whether it is worth his while to sink more capital into his business will be influenced by a very wide range of considerations: whether his market is likely to grow or decline; what his competitors are doing; whether prices are likely to go up or down;whether the latest type of machinery, is much superior to his own, and so on.It is in practice impossible to foresee with any certainty what decisions^business managements will reach on these matters: the prevailing atmospherefof optimism or pessimism, particularly in periods of rapid industrial change,probably has as much influence on them as any &quot;independent analysis of thefacts.46. In the majority of highly industrialised communities it is expenditureon private investment which is the most usual and most potent cause of in-stability in total expenditure, and consequently in employment. But thiscountry, because of the relative importance of its export trade, which beforethe war provided employment for about one and three-quarter million persons,is also particularly subject to fluctuations in employment arising from fluctua-tions in international trade. In 1929, for instance, the depression in Britishindustry was transmitted to this country from abroad. The state of our foreignbalance depends very largely upon the behaviour of persons and Governmentsoutside our jurisdiction. Our aim must therefore be to agree with other coun-tries on international measures which will be to our mutual advantage andwill render them partners with us in a common economic policy. As has been mentioned in Chapter I, the Government have already embarked on such discussions, with the object of increasing and stabilising the volume of world trade.47. The most serious obstacles to the maintenance of total expendituretherefore lie in these highly inconvenient facts:  First, those elements in total expenditure which are likely to fluctuate most-private investment and the foreign balance happen also to be the elementswhich are most difficult to control. * . .Secondly, an increase in one part of total expenditure can only within limits offset a. decrease in another. For if, through a decline in private invest-ment, the construction of new factories is discontinued and building labourersare thrown out of work, it may be useful to stimulate the purchase of clothingbut it would be idle to expect the building labourers to turn up the. next, dayready to handle sewing machines in the clothing factories. Again, if im-portant British exports fell off sharply,-it would&apos;-be;essential, at, the ^earliest moment, to find alternative exports to fill the gap&apos;: : an-expansion of internaldemand would not alone be an appropriate remedy and indeed, if it: were applied, too,vigorously, might lead to inflation,&apos;J-&apos;a  !,&quot;-. i &apos;- 48. The: guiding principles of the Governments policy in. maintaining, totalexpenditure will be as follows:     1       -      - t*  - ..-.(a) To avoid an unfavourable foreign balance, we must export much- more than we did before the war. .. if,?, viin^tur, -iswJat: i^ti Co-iitM(b) Everything possible must be done tq limit dangerous swings in ex-: penditure, on private investment-though success in this field .may&apos; be particularly difficult to achieve. afcl:? m $ km txi&apos;w :v-iM        k:m*d:slo
(c) Public investment, both in timing and in volume, must be carefully-planned to offset unavoidable fluctuations in private investment.: ,   (d) We must be ready to check and reverse the decline in expenditure,on consuiners&apos; goods which normally follows as a secondary reaction toa falling off in private investment.The plans which are being prepared for this purpose are described in chapter V.(b) The Stability of Prices and Wages49. Action taken by the Government to maintain expenditure will be fruit-less unless wages and prices are kept reasonably stable. This is of vitalimportance to any employment policy, and must be clearly understood by all sections of the public. If we are to operate with success a policy for maintaining a high and stable level of employment, it will be essential that employers and workers should exercise moderation in wages matters so that^,increased expenditure provided at the onset of a depression may go to increasethe volume of employment.50. This does not mean that every wage rate must remain fixed at a par-ticular level. There must always be room for the adjustment of wages and con-ditions, e.g. on account of changes in the form, method or volume of produc-tion. Also there must be opportunity for the removal of anomalies in the rateof remuneration of different grades and categories of workers, both within an industry and between different industries. The principle of stability doesmean, however, that increases in the general level of wage rates must be related to increased productivity due to increased efficiency and effort.51. Ah undue increase in prices due to causes other than increased wagesmight similarly frustrate action taken by the Government to maintain employ-ment. If, for example, the manufacturers in a particular industry were in.a ring for the purpose of raising prices, additional money made available by government action for the purpose of maintaining employment might simplybe absorbed in increased profit margins and no increase in employment wouldresult.52. Stability of wages and stability of prices are inextricably connected.If the general level of wage rates rises and there is a corresponding increasein prices of goods for civilian consumption, the individual wage-earner willbe no better off and there may be no increase in the total amount of employ-ment available.53. Thus, the stability of these two elements is a condition vital to thesuccess of employment policy; and that condition can be realised only by thejoint efforts of the Government, employers and organised labour. TheGovernment for their part are prepared to do what they can to stabiliseprices so as to avoid or mitigate changes not rendered inevitable by highercosts either of imports or of production at home. If, however, the costof living is thus kept stable it must be regarded as the duty of bothsides of industry to consider together all possible means of preventing a risein the costs of production or distribution and so avoiding the rise in prices which is the initial step in the inflationary process. - -        -&apos;    -54. Workers must examine their trade practices and customs.to ensure thatthey do not constitute a serious impediment to an expansionist economy andso defeat the object of a full employment programme. &apos;Employers, too, must seek in larger output rather than higher prices thereward of enterprise and good management.   There has kr recent years been a growing tendency towards combines and towards agreements, both.:national and international, by which manufacturers&apos; have sought to control
prices and. output, ,to divide markets, and to. fix conditions of sale. such agreements or. combines do not necessarily operate against the public interest;but the power to do so is there. The Government will therefore seek powerto inform themselves of the extent arid,.effect of restrictive agreements, and ofthe activities of combines; and to fake&apos; appropriate action to check practices which may bring advantages to sectional producing interests but work to the detriment of the country as a whole.       &apos; &apos;r .r-  &apos; &apos; l(c) The.Mobility of Labour55. Even if there is&apos;; an adequate &quot;overall demand for labour, maintained by a total expenditure sufficient to provide every worker with, a job, &quot;it doesriot follow that unemployment will altogether disappear. . In an economy which aims at keeping employment at its highest level, change will always begoing on; new industries will be starting up, new processes replacing old;new ways of meeting consumers&quot; demand will be &apos; under experiment,.^Numbers of - people will therefore be registering as unemployed at Em-ployment Exchanges on any particular date there will always be people who are changing from one job to another, or are unemployed for some such temporary reason. If short-term unemployment arising from such causes is tobe reduced to. a minimum every individual must exercise to the full hisown initiative in adapting himself to changing circumstances. The Govern-ment will assist by the measures designed to bring the men to the work andthe work to the men which have been described in Chapter III. They willalso seek to prevent mobility of labour being impeded by arrangements of atype sometimes made before the war whereby workers worked part-time and claimed unemployment benefit for the rest of the week.56. It would be a disaster if the intention of the Government to maintaintotal expenditure were interpreted as exonerating the citizen from the duty offending for himself and resulted in a weakening of personal enterprise. for if an expansion of total expenditure were applied, to cure unemployment of atype due, not to absence of jobs, but to failure of workers to move to places and occupations where they were needed, the policy of the Government wouldbe frustrated and a dangerous rise in prices might follow. \ . .V. METHODS FOR MAINTAINING TOTAL EXPENDITURE(a) Capital Expenditure57. If we could stop violent fluctuations in public and private capitalexpenditure taken together and could keep the foreign balance reasonablystable, we should have gone far to prevent wide variations iri demand andconsequently in general employment. The following paragraphs outline themeasures by which the Government propose, as part of their long-term policy, to influence the volume Of capital expenditure, private and public.-...5$. -In ordinary times the volume, of capital.expenditure is influenced ;bymovement in the-rate of interest. If the cost of borrowing money is high, spmeprojects which, are not profitable, at that rate will be held back. When. itfalls: again;; those projects will -be- brought forward and.others-, will-alsoj; be.taken in hand.- - .v        () tI      /  r.-:&apos;:-&apos;-.   -, m:        , j     ,-&apos;:-7;fr&apos; . ,- .&apos;  ^.....&quot; .. &apos; &quot;...&quot;1 y .   v *..   . 7 - v---&apos;s &apos;    - ..i 59. For some: time after the end ;of jthe war it will be necessary, as explained in paragraph 16, to maintain a policy of cheap money. Thereafter thepossibility of influencing capital expenditure: by the variation of interest rates will be kept in view. The experience &quot;gained -since 1931 of co-operation inthis field:-between the Treasury and the Bank of England and the JointStock Banks will make it possible; to &quot;operate&apos;.-a; concerted and effectiverrionetary policy designed to promote stable&apos; employment. 1 &apos;(u- nj  .
66. Monetary policy alone, however, will not be sufficient to defeat the inherent&apos; instability of capital expenditure. High interest rates are more effective in preventing excessive investment in periods of prosperity than are low interest rates in encouraging investment in periods of depression.61. The Government therefore propose to supplement monetary policy by encouraging privately-owned enterprises to plan their own capital expen-diture in conformity with a general stabilisation policy. The larger privateenterprises may be willing to follow, in their own interests, the example set by thei Government in the timing of public investment and to adjust their activities accordingly. For to a strong and well-established business, confidentof. its long-ran earning powers, there are ,obvious attractions in executingplans for expansion or for the replacement of obsolete plant at times when costs are low.. 4hd. a wider understanding of the social importance of the aims1 ofemployment policy should inform and. reinforce the interest which businessmen as a whole undoubtedly have in evening out fluctuations in capitakexpenditure. &quot;62. Public investment can, however, be used more directly as an instru-ment of employment policy.Only a small proportion of public capital expenditure is undertaken bythe central Government, by far the greater part being within the province of local authorities and public utility undertakings. In the past, capitalexpenditure by these authorities has generally followed the same trend as private capital expenditure it has fallen in times of slump and risen in times of boom, and has tended therefore to accentuate the peaks and depres-siohs of the. trade cycle. In the future, Government policy will be directed to correcting this sympathetic movement. It should be possible for the Govern-ment to maintain the stability of public investment when private investment is beginning to fall off at the onset of a depression. But this may not be enough: for the purpose of maintaining general employment it is desirablethat public investment should actually expand when private investment is declining and should contract in periods of boom. There are, however,practical limits to the extent to which Government action can produce swingsin public investment to offset such swings in private investment as it cannotprevent. Thus, a large part of the capital expenditure of public authorities for example on housing, schools and hospitals is dictated by urgent publicneeds the satisfaction of which cannot readily be postponed to serve thepurposes of employment policy. And, in the other direction, the Govern--ment could not compel substantial acceleration of the capital programmes of these public authorities without much more power of direction that they now possess. There are, therefore, limits to the policy, but within thoselimits the Government believe that they can influence public capital expen-diture to an extent which will be of material value for the purpose of main-taining employment.     ,, ;.;63. The procedure which the Government have in mind is as follows.&apos; all local authorities :will submit annually to the appropriate Department their programme of capital expenditure for the next five years. -For the first ofthose1 years, at least, the plans will&apos; have been worked out in all details andwill: be ready for immediate &quot;operation; for the later years they will naturally be increasingly tentative arid provisional: These programmes will then be assembled by an appropriate co-ordinating body under Ministers-arid&apos;willhe;.; adjusted, upward or downward&apos; ;in the.- light of the latest, information: onthe.prospective employment situation.If, this.entails a slojvi^g/Jap^m&apos;of/,ETQrgrammes, adequate powers, through the. withholding of loan sanctions . orgrants, are ready to hand:,If, it entails iya acceleration,-;^e&apos;&apos;(^yje5nffi^i&apos;&apos;&apos;%i4/
by granting loan sanctions or otherwise facilitating finance, bring forwardprojects which otherwise might have had to wait for a later opportunity.The Government are considering the lines on which this procedure can beapplied to the programming of capital expenditure by public utility companies.The machinery envisaged in this paragraph will enable the Government. toset each year a target for the whole volume of public works in the succeedingyear; ^i-ly^j-jdc.: . a;&quot;W :ith64. In order that public Investment may be more quickly mobilized to redress the balance ot private investment the Government also intend td seekmeans of reducing the time-lag which ordinarily intervenes between a decisionto undertake public capital expenditure and the actual start of the work. Speedhere is crucial, for if a,decline in demand can be caught quickly enoughand corrected, a comparatively modest amount of compensating expenditure-will be sufficient to restore the balance.    &apos;The Government therefore propose that the existing arrangements between themselves and other public authorities should be reviewed, in consultationwith those authorities, in order that any causes of unnecessary delay in vary-ing the level of this expenditure may be removed. There may also be otherretarding influences, e.g., in Parliamentary Private Bill procedure, whichare capable of improvement.65. Finally, forward planning may have to be carried down to the invdustries which supply the primary needs of public investment. Much time would be saved if, in those capital industries which are most subject tofluctuations and are the first to be affected by an increase in public invest-ment, attention had been given beforehand to the quickest Ways of switchingproduction from the types of article needed for private investment to the types required for those forms of public investment which, stand highest inpriority on the reserve list of public works. ! -        . &apos;66. The Government believe that in the past the power of public expendi-ture, skilfully applied, to check the onset of a. depression has been under-estimated. The whole notion of pressing forward quickly with public expen-diture when incomes were falling and the outlook was dark has, naturallyenough, encountered strong resistance from persons who are. accustomed,with good reason, to conduct their private affairs according to the veryopposite principle. Such resistance can, however, be overcome, if publicopinion is brought to the view that periods of trade recession provide anopportunity to improve the permanent equipment of society by the provisionof better housing, public buildings, means of communication, power and water supplies, etc.(b). Consumption Expenditure67. If, despite our efforts, there are still swings in capital&apos; expenditure;with consequent fluctuations in the expenditure of. people engaged; invtheindustries producing capital goods,., such: as,;the iron and steel industry^.&apos;fheincomes of persons engaged in making clpthirig.,,rwireless sets and othergoods for consumption will also be lowered .,M, These persons in turn will reduce their rate of consumption of food and other goods and,thus the hi?flucnce of the original swing in investment-will be rapidly transmittedthroughout the,-whole range of industries. - V.^.&apos;.:^-.68. We must create another line of defence&apos; &quot;against this progressivedegeneration ofthe state of trade by ; putting ourselves in a position to influence the community&apos;s expenditure on consumption. Here again;&quot;&apos; speedwill&apos; be &apos;&apos;essehfiaT. &apos; &apos; The ideal to be aimed &quot;at14s - some corrective infifiefiee
which, would come into play automatically on the analogy of a thermostaticcontrol in accordance with rules determined in advance and well understood by the public.For this purpose the Government, after examining a number of methods,favour the adoption, when settled conditions return, of a scheme for varying,in sympathy with the state of employment, the weekly contribution to bepaid by employers and employed under the proposed new system of social insurance. The standard rate of contribution would be assessed on the basisof a forecast of the average level of unemployment, in such a way as to keepthe social insurance fund in balance over a number, of years. But the rateof contribution actually levied would exceed the standard rate at times whenunemployment fell below the estimated average level and would be lessthan the standard rate at times when unemployment exceeded this average.An outline for a scheme of this kind is set out,, by way of illustration, inAppendix II. ^69. The effect of this scheme would be that, above a certain level ofunemployment, a rise of two points in the unemployment percentage woulddecrease by an average of  500,000 a week the total of the social insurance contributions paid by workers in employment apart from the corresponding reduction in the costs of employers. This would substantially augment the purchasing power in the hands of employed workers; and the additionalmoney thus left in the hands of many millions of people would help to maintaindemand for consumers&apos; goods, thereby offsetting, at least in part, the declinein the expenditure of those who had lost their employment. This maintenanceof purchasing power would reduce substantially the variations in totalexpenditure and employment.70. A plan of this kind is in no way inconsistent with the contributory basis of the social insurance scheme. It is still intended that over a period ofyears the contributions to the fund, supplemented by State assistance onthe agreed scale, should balance its outgoings, and that the standard ratesof contributions should be altered from time to time if necessary to secure this result.71. A scheme for varying social insurance contributions would be aninappropriate remedy for the type of unemployment which is likely to arise in the transition period. Moreover, there would be serious risk of confusionif such a scheme were brought into operation too soon after the introductionof the new system of social insurance. The introduction of that system willitself present a formidable problem of administration for the State, aridcontributors also will need time to adjust themselves to the new conditions.On both grounds it would be preferable that there should be an interval forthe new system to establish itself before this additional complication is intro-duced. While, therefore, the plan and any necessary qualifications of it willbe drawn up in detail, it will not be put into operation until the abnormalconditions of the immediate post-war years have disappeared.72. The Government have also examined a number of other devices forinfluencing the volume of consumption, such as the variation of rates of taxa-. tion and the incorporation of some system of deferred credits as a permanent feature of national taxation. Since after the War a very considerable propor-tion of the national income will have to be taken in taxes, it is clear, thatrelatively small variations in rates of taxation, whether effected by deferredcredits or otherwise, will have a significant effect on the purchasing power available to the public and so on employment. Deferred credits are prefer--able to any system of direct variation which, apart from its other disadvan-tages; would come into operation more slowly than an effective policy demands.&apos;
MIf experience should &apos;show.:that,the,variation-of social.-insurancecontributionswas of value in keeping employment steady at a high level,- but&apos;that anotherinstrument for operating upon&apos;the volume of consumption was also;desirable,it might well become a matter for consideration whether in prosperous timesrather: more taxation should be raised than was necessary.&apos;for the Budgetrequirement of the year and that excess treated as a credit &quot;repayable to thetaxpayers in bad times. In addition, it is proposed to continue the study ofother methods of influehcing the volume of consumption; such as the ppssi-bility of regulating hire purchase&apos;transactions according to the state of trade,as knowledge and experience of the new technique are.accumulated, &apos;-.&apos; &quot; (c) Central Finance..73. None of the main proposals contained in this Paper involves deliberateplanning for a deficit in the National Budget in years of sub-normal trade^activity. A policy of low interest rates is helpful rather than otherwise tophe Budget.; Any action which can be taken to improve our foreign balance.works in the same direction. The -designed variations in the capital posi-tion of the social insurance fund will not affect the Revenue Budget. Financialinducements to public authorities to expand capital expenditure will mainlytake the form of an annual grant towards meeting recurrent charges on the loans raised and their burden will conseqently be spread over a long period.Moreover, the success of measures designed to stabilise the national income and prevent cyclical depressions will have the -effect of ironing out Budgetdeficits which are normally associated with severe depression.74. Much of the public capital expenditure by public authorities which hasbeen described is likely to be remunerative in the commercial sense and willamortise itself. There will be other public capital expenditure--e.g. on roads,schools, parks, etc. which provides no assets yielding income; but in moderncommunities borrowing for services of this kind is, within certain limits, re-garded as normal practice. If the finances of local authorities are prudentlyadministered, and a proper relation is kept between the growth of capitalexpenditure and the-buoyancy of rate income, it is unlikely that the growth of their indebtedness would involve an intolerable burden on local rates. If,however, the additional capital expenditure which local authorities are askedto undertake for reasons of employment policy would involve such a burden,the Government would contemplate giving further financial assistance tothem.75. Nevertheless, the general growth of public indebtedness needs to be watched from a ,central standpoint. As a result of two wars within onegeneration the national debt is now extremely large both absolutely and inrelation to the national income. Whatever problems may. arise from thegrowth of productive or semi-productive debt, they will be mitigated if wecan move as soon as possible into-a state of affairs in which an effective re-duction can be made from year to year in that part of the public debt whichis a dead-weight war debt. We start with a handicap. In the transition period,when demand will be buoyant, the Government would normally expect to-budget for a surplus in order to prepare for the lean, years. But during this-period that aim is not likely to be achieved. On the one hand Govern-ment expenditure-will still be very. high on defence and on reconstructionprojects which cannot be delayed; and on the other hand there will be apressing need to reduce the present very high level of taxation in order toencourage industrial re-equipment. It is inevitable therefore that we shouldemerge from the transition period with.some increase in our public indebted^;ness*-:;x&apos;&apos;:r;a ;k4:^:Tv?;..&apos; -.&apos; ;&apos;! &quot;cr^ii^f&amp;^^-iio &apos;M bW \\h:HlHy:&apos;:76. The policy of steadily decreasing the dead-weight debt, while other formsof debt;are mcreasing, does not mean a rigid policy of balancing the Budget134837 - a5
each, year regardless of the state of trade. Such a policy is not required, by statute nor is it part of our tradition. There is nothing to prevent the. Chan-cellor of the Exchequer in future, as in the past, from taking into account the requirements of trade, and employment in framing his annual Budget.At the same time; to the extent that the policies proposed in this Paper affectthe balancing of the Budget in a particular year, they certainly do not con-template any departure from the principle that the Budget must be balancedover a longer period.77. Not only the national dead-weight debt in the narrow sense, but other public indebtedness which involves directly or indirectly a charge on theExchequer or on the rates, reacts on the financial system. Interest and other charges thus falling on the Exchequer are often regarded as in the natureof a transfer income in the hands of the recipients and as imposing no realburden on the community as a whole. But the matter does not present itself in that light to the taxpayer, on whose individual effort and enterprise high-taxation acts as a drag. At the same time, proper limits on public borrowing)also depend on the magnitude of the debt charge in relation to the rate of growth of the national income. In a country in which money, income is increasing, the total debt can be allowed to increase by quite appreciableamounts without increasing the proportionate burden of the interest on thatdebt. Owing to the prolonged decline in the birth rate and the present agedistribution of the population we can no longer rely, as in the past, on anincrease in the national income resulting solely from an increase in thenumber of income-earning persons. It is also possible, though not certain,that we may find that we receive a smaller volume of goods from abroad in exhange for a given quantity of our exports. On the other hand, these difficulties would be more than offset by continued progress in technical efficiency, which is the dominating factor in the growth of real national in-come. If British industry carries into the peace the inventive power, technicalskill and adaptability which it has shown during the war, we shall be able in due time to carry our burdens without a sense of excessive strain.78: Both at home and abroad the handling of our monetary problems isregarded as a test of the general firmness of the policy of the Government..An undue growth of national indebtedness will have a quick result on confid-ence. But no less serious would be a budgetary deficit arising from a fall ofrevenue due to depressed industrial and commercial conditions. Therefore,in controlling the situation, especially in the difficult years after the war,the Government will have equally in mind the need to maintain the national income, and the need for a policy of budgetary equilibrium such as willijiaintain the confidence in the future which is necessary for a healthy andenterprising industry.VI. THE POLICY IN PRACTICE79. In submitting proposals for an extension of State control over thevolume of employment, the Government recognise that they are entering afield where theory can be applied to practical issues with confidence andcertainty only as experience accumulates and experiment extends over untriedground. Not long ago, the ideas embodied in the present proposals wereunfamiliar to the general public and the subject of controversy amongeconomists. To-day, the conception of an expansionist economy, and the broad principles governing its.growth are widely accepted by men of affairs as. well as by technical experts in all the great industrial countries. But thewhole of the measures here proposed have never yet been systematicallyapplied as part of the official economic policy of any Government. In thesematters we shall be pioneers. We must determine, therefore, to learn fromexperience; to invent and improve the instruments of our new policy as we
move forward to its goal. And it would be no less foolish to ignore, than tobe dismayed by,, the certainty that unsuspected obstacles will emerge inpractice.80. The Government intend to establish on a permanent basis asmall central staff qualified to measure and analyse economic trends and submit appreciations of them to the Ministers concerned. Particularly duringthe crucial early years of the scheme the responsibilities of this central staff will be very heavy; for many of the decisions required to carry out theGovernment&apos;s employment policy will depend on quick and accurate diag-nosis. A slump may develop with fearful rapidity: in 1920-21 unemploy-ment rose from 5 to 15 per cent, in four months. Again, it is essential thatwe should not mistake the disease and so- apply the wrong remedy. If, forexample,, we were to&apos; try to cure by means of stimulating total expenditurean outbreak of unemployment which was really due to a temporary rnal-SJstribution of the labour force, we might create a dangerous inflation,similarly, isolated or. incidental trade recessions will have to be distinguished from those which herald the onset of general unemployment. Questions of timing will be equally delicate: it is no easy matter to judge when a periodof growing prosperity has reached its climax, is in process of turning into aninflation and requires corrective action.81. The success of the Governments policy will thus depend on the skillwhich is shown in putting general ideas into day-to-day practice. It is there-fore vital for them to obtain, more fully and much more quickly than theyhave in the past, exact quantitative information about current economic move-ments. Without this., informed control would be impossible and the centralstaff which it is proposed to set up would be left to grope and flounder inuncertainty. The Government appeal with confidence to industry to join withthem in a task which is essentially co-operative; for only industry can providethe statistical information required and only a central authority can classifyand analyse information drawn from the country as a whole. Just as thecentral organisation of a successful business must be in a position to know what is happening to each of its various branches, so the State cannot make its plans without knowledge of what is happening throughout the whole range of industry and commerce. Information provided for this purpose will ofcourse be treated as confidential; and figures will not be published in a form which would prejudice the position of any individual firm.82. The following are the principal classes of statistics (in addition to thoseavailable before the war) which must be obtained for the efficient operationof an employment policy:  [a) Statistics of employment and unemployment, including quarterly ormonthly statements of present and prospective employment in the mainindustries and areas in. the country, based on returns from employers.(&amp;) Regular information relating to savings,, projected capital expendi-ture by public authorities, and,, as far as possible, by private industry.(c) An annual census of production showing the structure of the maingroups of industries in the preceding year, including, inter alia, the detailsof the quantity and value of output&apos;, stocks, and work in progress.(d) Monthly figures of production, consumption and stocks, and, if pos-sible, figures of orders on hand, based on sample returns obtained period-cally throughout the year from large firms, trade associations, and publicinstitutions.(e) Annual and quarterly estimates of foreign capital movements and balance of foreign payments.
83. It is also proposed to develop the annual White Paper on national income and Expenditure by providing a much more complete analysis than has hitherto been possible of the constituent parts of the country&apos;s totalexpenditure. In particular, direct estimates will be made of the various types of. capital expenditure and the various sources of savings. This willbe, in effect, the Capital Budget of the nation&apos;s wealth.84. This central analysis of our financial position, which will be subjectto continuous review and adjustment throughout the year, will serve as abasis for determining what measures are required to maintain employment and secure a rising standard of living. It will be essential, therefore, thatat every stage there should also be parallel studies of the manpower position.These will be undertaken by the Ministry of Labour and National Servicewho, in the light of the knowledge and experience which they have acquiredduring the war, will be specially well-equipped to keep the employment situa-.don throughout the country under constant review and to direct attentioijgtO the employment aspects of national policy. The surveys prepared by theMinistry of Labour will indicate the probable supply of labour over thecoming period, the prospective changes in employment in the different indus-tries, and the effects upon employment of Government projects designed tomodify the volume of investment or expenditure The correlation of thesecomplementary budgets for total expenditure and for manpower will thusplay a vital part in the formulation of Government policy for the maintenanceof employment.85. The Debates on the Budget will in future provide an annual opportunityfor Parliament to review the financial and economic health of the country as a whole, and to consider the prospects for the coming year. parliament will thus be asked to join- with &quot;the Government in framing and approving the general strategy for maintaining employment. If, however, the policy set forth in this Paper is to be successful, the Government of the day mustbe able to take the tactical decisions for which it calls and to take them .quickly. Measures to increase total expenditure at the onset of a depressionmay well be welcome; but the restraining measures appropriate to a boommay meet with opposition unless they are seen and understood as part of a continuing policy for maintaining employment, and accepted as the price that must be paid for the success of that policy over the long period. If action is to be taken quickly enough to have its full effect, the Government of theday must be able to rely on the support and co-operation of the public in applying the principles of an agreed national policy.86. The Government believe that, once the war has been won, we can make a fresh approach, with better chances of success than ever before,to the task of maintaining a high and stable level of employment withoutsacrificing the essential liberties of a free society. They have set out inthis Paper the lines on which they believe that task can most hopefully be attacked. In framing these proposals the Government have had in mind themore general aim of securing for the nation the most effective use both of itsman-power and of its material resources. That aim can be achieved only if the whole productive power of the nation is employed efficiently: it isnot enough that it should be employed. The Government therefore seek to achieve both work for all and a progressive increase in the economic efficiency of the nation, as joint elements in a growing national power to produce, to earn, and to enjoy the fruits of increased well-being.

- APPENDIX II.Variation of Social Insurance Contributions.i. In paragraph jggr of the Paper reference is made to a scheme for varying social insurance contributions as a means of influencing expenditure on consumption. the primary object of such a scheme is to prevent an initial decline in demand fromproducing, secondary effects on consumption and thus intensifying the depression. Ina time of expanding demand the scheme would operate in the contrary direction.It is thus intended to have a stabilizing effect on employment.2. It is desirable that the scheme, when once it has been introduced, should operate as &apos; automatically as possible. It would not be appropriate to put the scheme intooperation during the transition period because of the inflationary tendencies which willbe at work at that time. Even after the end of that period there may be circum-stances in which this remedy would be less appropriate and effective, e.;g. if there were serious unemployment confined to particular industries but not accompanied by a significant general fall in employment throughout the country. Nevertheless, afterthe end of the transition period, a sliding scale scheme, though subject to possiblesuspension on occasion, could be essentially automatic in character.3. There are several ways of constructing a scheme of this kind. The following isgiven by way of illustration :  (i) The scheme would apply to the social insurance contributions of all employed persons.(ii) The stamp to be affixed by the employer to each employee&apos;s social insurancecard would vary automatically according to the state of unemployment.(iii) The scale laid down would be based on a forecast of the average level ofunemployment from time to time taken as the basis of the finance of the insurancescheme. If, for example, an average level of 8 per cent, unemployment was assumed, one possible scale for adult male workers (using for purpose of illus-tration the rates proposed in the Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services(Cmd. 6404) ) might be:  Weekly Social InsuranceStampUnemployment percentage Worker       Employer        Joints.   d. s.   d. s.   d.Less than 5 per cent. ...       ...       56 46 10   oBetween 5 and 7 per cent.Between 7 and 9 per cent.Between 9 and 11 per cent.   ...50 4P 90-4   3 3   3 7636 26 60More than 11 per cent. ...       ...       30 20 504. The scheme would bring about a substantial increase in purchasing power. Theeffect may be illustrated from the foregoing figures. Should it occur that in a periodof difficulty average unemployment changed by four points from 8 per cent, to 12 percent., nearly 10 million adult male workers would have their incomes increased byis. 3d. per week and employers would have their prime costs reduced by is. 3d. perweek for each adult male in their employ. Assuming comparable changes in thecontributions of adult female workers and non-adults, this rise of four points in theunemployment percentage would result in an immediate increase of nearly ^mi a week in the incomes of the workers, and a corresponding reduction in the costs of their employers.5. This injection into the general system of money at the rate of some ^100 millions in a year may be estimated, after analysis of many considerations affecting it (includingits secondary effects and a necessary allowance for the part which is withheld fromexpenditure, the part which is paid in taxation and the part which is spent on imports), to produce a very material increase in the expenditure on home produce for personal consumption, rising after an interval to a figure in the region of at least^m7o-8o. This does not take into account any favourable reactions on capitalexpenditure. At the level of unemployment of 12 per cent, used in the above illustra-tion, the scheme might reduce the fall in aggregate demand by about one quarter andin consumption expenditure by a substantially larger fraction, compared with what it would otherwise have been.6. There are, however, difficulties attaching even in the long term to the automaticuse of the scheme. For during periods of high unemployment the Fund would be receiving less than it was paying out, and the reverse would be true in time of lowunemployment. If, therefore, the average around which the variations took placeproved to have been a correct forecast, deficits in some years would be balanced by
surpluses in other years.   If, however, the average were wrongly forecast, it wouldbe necessary, at some stage, to adjust the scale in order to make the Fund balance overa reasonable period of good and bad years. .   ,      &quot;    ,This raises a difficulty which is to some extent inherent in any social insurancescheme which includes unemployment insurance. If the estimate of the averagepercentage of unemployment assumed for the purpose of balancing the Fund provedin experience to have been too low, it would be necessary, apart from the sliding scale, to raise the standard rates of contribution in order to prevent the Fund fromrunning into a continuing deficit. It might prove that the solvency of the Fundrequired the change to be made at a time when conditions were depressed. In thesecircumstances the sliding scale would be an added disadvantage; for not only would thestandard rate of contribution be raised, but the basic figure of unemployment wouldalso be raised, beyond which increases of unemployment would justify some lessercontribution than the standard rate. Thus there would be two factors operatingsimultaneously, each of which would call for an increase in the rate of contributions.7. A variable contribution also increases the possibility of error in forecasting the^ryture finances of the Social Insurance Fund. Under the fixed contribution method,^f 8 per cent, (to take the same illustration as before) was the forecasted percentageof unemployment on which the Fund was balanced, and in actual practice unemploy-ment averaged 9 per cent., the effect would be an average deficit of  mij a year overthe period. The introduction of the sUding scale would probably result, on reasonableassumptions as to the dispersion of unemployment about the realised average, in anadditional deficit of  10.15 a year.8. The illustrative figures given in this Appendix do not take into account the effectof this scheme and the other measures described in the Paper in lowering the averagepercentage of ejapl^HBeHt, M-^&amp;^^&amp;^lt^U^tk-(34837)   Wi.120 galiey, 120 paged   5/44   d.l.  g. 390
