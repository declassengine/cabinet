Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944./Copy No.    3 war CABINET.FUTURE OF THE BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE British Overseas Airways Act, 1939, provided for :- (a) the establishment of a Public Corporation to be called the british overseas Airways Corporation which would be the chosen instrument of the Government and as such the sole recipient of subsidy for thedevelopment of overseas air services, and would be financed by fixed-interest bearing stock guaranteed as to capital and interest by theTreasury but carrying no equity value; and(b) the purchase by the Corporation of the undertakings of the two subsidisedairline companies Imperial Airways and British Airways whichwere then operating (with a few unimportant exceptions) all british overseas air services.Reasons for the Establishment of B.O.A.C.2. Many, if not all, of the reasons which led the Government of the day to propose the establishment of this Public Corporation are of equal validitynow. The main considerations, as stated by the late Sir Kingsley Wood whenintroducing the Bill, were :  -(a) Parliament was being invited to increase the subsidy provision to 3,000,000 a year, the greater part of which was to be spent on overseas development; and Parliament was entitled to be assured thatthe capital needed for this development would be raised on terms which placed the least burden on the Exchequer and that public money would not be used for inflating dividends.Mb) There was a &quot; real necessity for advancing the national position in reference to civil aviation overseas.&quot; This could, not be done, in the face of heavily-subsidised foreign competition, by private companies whichmust have regard,, first and foremost, to the interests of their share-holders. Under the Public Corporation, &quot;national interests and national advance &apos;&apos; would come first.(c) There  was  a  significant  difference  between  the   directive  of  theCorporation, which was defined in the Bill as &quot;to secure the fullestdevelopment consistent with economy of efficient overseas air transport services,&quot; and that given to Imperial Airways, which was &quot; to use&apos;its best endeavours to make its services self-supporting at the earliestpossible moment.&quot;(d) The experiment of competition between different airline companiessubsidised by the British Exchequer had been tried in the early days of British civil aviation and had been a failure. Competition betweencompanies in receipt of Exchequer subsidies meant that the state was competing against itself.(e) Many other countries had adopted the policy of a single chosen instrument for overseas air transport, with successful results.(/) There were, in fact, great advantages to be gained by concentrating in oneorganisation the available experience, equipment, ground organisa-. tion, technical resources, and so on.^g) All  the  competition  needed  for  the healthy  development of  theCorporation would be provided by the airlines of foreign countries.[27536]SECRET.W.P. (44) 268.27th May, 1944.
The War-time Position.3. The Corporation came into effective being on the 1st April, 1940, and theyhave been operating since then wholly on war tasks. The route mileage nowbeing flown by the Corporation is more than four times the combined route mileageflown by Imperial Airways and British Airways in the last complete year beforethe Corporation took them over. Despite the manifold difficulties of regularairline operation in war-time, of which the chief has been the lack of aircraftdesigned for transport work, the Corporation have done a fine war job in many parts of the world and their performance augers well for the future.Claims of Surface Transport Interests.4. The shipping and railway companies, realising that after the war manypassengers and an increasing range of freight which formerly used surface transport will travel by air, are claiming that the operation of overseas air services on routes in which they are interested should be entrusted to them. Therailways are mainly concerned with services to the Continent, and the shipping companies with services on the routes served by their ships.The question of air services to the Continent need not be considered in thepresent connection. For one thing, among the proposals endorsed at theCommonwealth Conference last autumn was one for the establishment of aninternational organisation after the war for the operation of air services inEurope. To what extent we should participate in such an international agencyis a matter for decision later. Again, there is a case for entrusting the operationof services between the United Kingdom and Europe to an organisationresponsible for the operation of air services within this country, and we have yet to decide what our internal arrangements are to be.The latest statement of the case for the shipping companies was that madeby Lord Essendon in the House of Lords on the 10th May, with particular reference to the service to South America. The gist of his remarks was asfollows : 1(a) If Britain is to* attain the same position in the air as she has attainedon the sea, it is difficult to believe that this can be done through the medium of a single national Corporation.(b) Every trade route has its own diversity of problems, of which shipping companies engaged on that route have great experience.(c) On routes where subsidy is not required, there can be no justification for preventing private enterprise from establishing services.(d) The shipping companies have been able to make  an  outstandingcontribution to the war effort, and it would be unfair &apos;&apos; to start aGovernment-owned airline to take away the cream of the traffic whichthey had built up by their past efforts without allowing themto defend their interests by undertaking air services themselves.&quot;(e) On the route to South America, the embryo company, in which fiveBritish shipping companies were participating British latin american Air Lines had prepared estimates which showed that &quot; itshould be possible to establish a service to South America on aneconomic basis without a subsidy &quot; provided that airport facilities and meteorological and radio services were made available at, orlargely at, public cost.Comments on these claims.5.   It would unduly lengthen this Paper to answer these claims in detail,but the following points are important: (a) In the House of Lords on the 11th May, the Lord Privy Seal asked thesepertinent questions : What is it exactly that the shipping companieswant? Do they want to take over all the B.O.A.C. services or only some services, leaving the residue to B.O.A.C. in other words, &quot; takethe eyes out of the carcase&apos;&apos; ? Obviously, the second alternative is what the companies have in mind. The effect would, however, be toleave B.O.A.C. with the unprofitable routes on which air services mustbe provided in the national interest and to increase p,ro tanto the costto the State. The effect on the morale of the Corporation^ staff would be deplorable.
(b) The shipping companies have no experience of actual airline operation.Yet they assert that they could provide services on certain routeswithout direct Exchequer assistance, though indirect subsidy in theform of free facilities would be required. This claim is open to serious doubt. Even allowing for indirect subsidy, it is unlikely thata service from this country to South America, or indeed on any other of the long overseas air routes, could be truly self-supporting for aconsiderable time to come.(c) There are two important considerations to which Lord Essendon didnot refer : (i) If the payment for the carriage of mails is inflated so as to contain a hidden subsidy, a service on almost any route could be self-supporting. The shipping companies have not yet said what is,in their view, reasonable remuneration for the carriage of mails. It may well.be that their claim to be able to operate air services without Exchequer assistance is based, in fact, on ahidden mail subsidy.(ii) It is one of the aims which we are advocating in the internationalfield that subsidies should be controlled. We do not know howfar our proposals will be acceptable to the nations of the worldbut there is no doubt that if air services operated by the british shipping companies were faced with competition from subsidy-dised foreign airlines or if, for other reasons, they found thatthey could not make both ends meet, an Exchequer subsidy would be quickly demanded.- -(d) It is significant that the Canadian Government, with their experienceof the State railways (The Canadian National Railways) andprivately-owned railways (Canadian Pacific Railways) operating in competition, have decided that surface transport interests shall notbe permitted to participate in airline operation. Moreover, in theU.S.A., surface transport interests are forbidden by law fromoperating airlines and the indications are that this policy will becontinued after the war.Where does the national interest lie f6. The answer is clear. It was given by Sir Kingsley Wood-seeparagraph 2 above.   Other considerations have since emerged.   These are :- (a) Since the 1939 Act was passed, we have been able to test the capacityof a Public Corporation to conduct air transport operations. Withvigorous direction, such as B.O.A.C. now enjoy, and with theirinherited and acquired experience, they are as capable of maintaining and developing the prestige of this country in the air as any collectionof commercial companies.&apos; And the ultimate cost to the State, takingeverything into consideration, will be much less.(b) It is also clear that the operation of all British overseas air services wouldnot be too large an undertaking for a single organisation. B.O.A.C.are still a small organisation compared with Transport Command ofthe Royal Air Force and, allowing for every foreseeable expansion ofcivil air services, they are likely to remain so. It will be many years before B.O.A.C. are a bigger undertaking than, say, I.C.I or theL.M.S. Even if the task became too big for one organisation, the rightsolution would be to convert B.O.A.C. into a holding corporationoperating through wholly-owned subsidiaries.(c) All recent experience has confirmed the view that the development of air transport is essentially a long-term undertaking calling for a consistent policy which must be pursued over the years, through goodtimes and bad. * Moreover, it is already evident that many services willbe required after the war which would not be justified by the ordinarycriteria of a commercial carrier. e.g., to promote the cohesion of theCommonwealth, to facilitate the administration of the colonial empire, to facilitate British participation in the development of aviation and feeder lines in backward countries, to support bur trade,enhance our national prestige and so on. A public Corporation is better able to do all these things as an instrument of public policy thana number of private companies, however large their resources.
(d) The State has spent large sums of money both before and during the war on aeronautical research, development and production. It will beexpected to do the same after the war. Many, if not all, of the new types of civil aircraft now planned will be financed by the State. Ifthese aircraft are eventually to be sold to private interests at a price which reflects the true cost, any hope of operating profitable services with them will disappear. If the true cost is not recovered in the selling price, the State will once more be providing indirect assistance on a large scale. Why should the benefit of this public expenditureenure to private shareholders ?(e) The Canadian and South African Governments have announced that they intend to entrust their post-war overseas air services to single State-owned organisations. India has expressed herself in favour of thePublic Corporation principle. Australia anfl New Zealand have gonefurther and advocated international operation by international organisations owned by the participating States. If internationaloperation is an ideal which cannot as yet be achieved, there are great advantages to be gained by joint operating arrangements between thevarious Commonwealth and Empire, countries concerned on the mainEmpire routes. But a joint operating organisation in which some ofthe partners were State-owned and State-directed Public corporations and the others private companies would not be a happy or efficientinstrument.   Oil and water do not mix.(/) If international air operation does not seem practicable to-day, we may besure that the peoples of the world will demand it to-morrow, perhapson the very morrow of the peace. How could we justify going back onour tracks and substituting for the policy of the 1939 Act a policywhich would, impede the coming together of the nations in a workingpartnership, which would be construed as a reversion to the philosophyof exclusive and short-sighted nationalism ? And this while our youngmen are away at the war !   And this in the air&apos;!(g) It is surely common prudence, if not indeed our duty, to have regard, inthe framing of our policy, to the direction in which public opinion is moving and to set a course which at least does not lie in the teethof the prevailing wind. Were we to ignore public opinion and go back on what was done in 1939, it would not be long before the countryinsisted that private interests should once again be bought out of theair and the cost to public funds would once again be very heavy.Conclusion.7. I have done no more in this Paper than set out as briefly as I can some ofthe salient considerations in this most important problem. They are, I submit,sufficient to show that the national interest will best be served by maintaining the principle of the Act of 1939 and, so far from clipping the wings of B.O.A.C.or abolishing the Corporation altogether in favour of private interests, by layingit down that, after the war, all British overseas air services, whether subsidisedor not, will be operated by the nationally-owned instrument.8.   I invite my colleagues to endorse this conclusion.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry,27th May, 1944.
