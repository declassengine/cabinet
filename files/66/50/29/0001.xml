Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 279.20th May, 1944. fWAR CABINET.PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF BRITISH AIRLINES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.AT the request of the Civil Air Transport Committee of the War Cabinet,I have circulated (as W.P. (44) 268) a memorandum on the future of theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation.2. The memorandum shows, I think, that the case for preserving theCorporation as the single chosen instrument of the State for the operation of overseas air services and, indeed, for extending its scope is conclusive.3. I feel that my colleagues would wish to have the following brief com-ments on certain of the points raised by the Lord Privy Seal in his memorandumon the Private Ownership of British Airlines (W.P. (44) 263 (Revise)).Paragraphs 1 and 2. .Though the war has inevitably led to a drastic curtailment of the EmpireAir Maii Scheme, successful efforts have been made to keep it in being in anattenuated form during the war so that, barring any fundamental change in policy, it can resume its pre-war scope on the return of peace. Letters which Inave received within the last day or two from the Prime Ministers of Australiaand New Zealand show that both countries are anxious to see the full Schemerestored as soon as practicable, if possible before the end of the war-It is true, as the Lord Privy Seal says, that the G.P.O. are free to placeair-mail contracts with other airline companies. But so long as the Empire AirMail Scheme is in existence under which B.O!A.C. receive, for fifteen years ofthe contract, an annual fixed sum calculated on the basis of the total mail likelyto be forthcoming for carriage by air, it would hardly be in the national interest that some of that mail for destinations covered by the Scheme should be diverted to private operators; the State would then be paying twice over for the carriage of mail on particular routes.So far as I am aware, South Africa has given no indication that she wishes to withdraw from the Scheme. She has, however, announced her intention ofentrusting all her external air services to a single chosen instrument owned and directed by the State. Similarly, Canada has announced that her choseninstrument for the operation of all her external air services will be transjTJanada-Airways, which is also Government-owned.Paragraphs 3 and 4.I have set out in W.P. (44) 268 the reasons why our overseas air services should not be handed over to private interests who would enjoy, under the licensing system proposed by the Lord Privy Seal, monopoly rights on particularroutes. In any case, there is no statutory provision for a licensing system for our overseas air services, so that no action could now be taken on the lines he suggestswithout fresh legislation.Paragraph 5.Aeronautical science has certainly made great strides under the impetus ofwar, but as I have shown in W.P. (44) 268 the statement that with a return to private enterprise &apos;&apos; expansion of British overseas airline operations would besecured without subsidy&quot; requires substantial qualification.[27541]
Paragraph 6.The net revenue which the State would derive from &quot; postal surcharges, &amp;c,&quot;would be not less, and probably more, if our overseas air services were operated by a public corporation instead of by private interests. How far the ratescharged to the public for air mails are to be weighted for the benefit of theExchequer is, of course, a matter of fiscal policy.Paragraphs 7 and 8.Foreign competition and competition with other forms of transport willprovide all the stimulus needed to keep the British Corporation on its toes. Underthe proposals which the Government are advocating for the regulation of inter-national air transport after the war, provision will be made for the publicationof the operating costs of the various national airlines. In these circumstances,inefficiency on the part of operators would be quickly disclosed.Paragraph 9.What the fighting man will want after the war will be stable employment at decent rates of pay according to his qualifications. He will be much lessinterested in the question whether he has choice, of employment between, say,Elder Dempsters on a service to West Africa, or British Latin American Airlineson a service to South America. A single British Corporation operating and controlling a wide network of services, including feeder services in countires overseas, will be much better placed to offer its personnel the prospect of steadyemployment over the Whole of their working lives than private airline companieswho would be confined by their licences to particular routes and whose prosperitywould tend to fluctuate according to a variety of circumstances, many of thembeyond their control.Paragraph 10.I have circulated a separate Paper (W.P. (44) 277). oh the problem ofinternal air services. This shows that there is a strong case for the establishmentof a Public Corporation for the operation of these services and also that thereare objections to the resuscitation of a licensing system.Paragraph 11.No suitable transport aircraft can be spared at the present time for services&apos;which do not directly subserve the war effort.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, 29th May, 1944.
