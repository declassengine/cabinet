Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 274.2Qth May, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER RE-ALLOCATION PLANS : THE NEED FOR SECRECY.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.AT their Meeting on the 21st March, the War Cabinet considered thequestion of publication of the scheme for re-allocation of man-power after theend of hostilities in Europe, outlined in the draft White Paper circulated by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (44) 162).2. I expressed the opinion that it would be better, from the point of viewof morale in the Services, not to lay a White Paper or publish a statement onthis matter at present. The Minister of Labour and National Service, in accepting this view, suggested that steps should be taken to discourage discussion on this subject in the Press.3. It follows from the decision to postpone the official statement on theGovernments plans for re-allocation that everything possible should be done to prevent any disclosure which might lead to the circulation of unauthorisedstatements in the Press and elsewhere. Departments should therefore ensurethat strict silence upon this subject is observed and that all documents relatingto it are handled with the greatest secrecy.W. S. C.10 Downina Street, S.W. 1,26^ May, 1944.
