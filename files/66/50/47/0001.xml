RECORD OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTERAND GENERAL de GAULLE ON THE 4th JUNE, 1944.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had wished to see General de Gaullein order to tell him as he had been unable to do by telegraph of the forthcomingoperation. He felt that it would have been a very bad thing in the history ofour two countries if an operation designed to liberate France had been undertaken by British and American Forces without the French being informed.His intention had been to invite the General a little &quot;before D day. A mass ofshipping of every kind, amounting to some 4,000 ships, had been assembled inthe ports, and 150,000 assault troops had been embarked for the first wave of the attack. In view of the weather, however, it had.been decided to postpone theoperation for 24 hours at least, from the previous D day, and probably, sincethe forecasts were bad, until D -t- 3. The operation, whenever it took place, wasto be preceded by an airborne landing of 3 divisions. On present weather forecastthis would not be possible immediately and it would obviously detract fromthe value of the initial assault, if the air were absent. The enemy had placedstrong defences along the northern coast of France, which, according to themilitary authorities, could only be moved at the lowest tide. It was intendedto use minesweepers as soon as the light broke. But if the operation were putoff until D -I- 3, as was probable, we might have to sweep the minefields in daylight. The operation comprised 35 divisions, as well as reinforcements. Thereason for the bombing of the French railways, which to our regret had caused, such loss of life, was that it enabled us to limit, in accordance with our growingstrength, the number of enemy divisions that could be used against us at any given moment while our front was building up.The postponement was a great blow to us. Many thousands of troops hadto be kept in conditions of discomfort in small ships. They were full of ardour;but now they had to be kept waiting. It was possible that if the weather becamereally bad, there might have to be delay of ten or twelve days. If there were much delay we might lose the advantages of moon, tide, weather and wind. Inspite of all the difficulties, we hoped to be able to begin at dawn on D + 3. after that date conditions would be difficult until D + 13, and even then there wouldbe no moon. This would be serious for us from the point of view of aviation, inwhich, as the General knew, we put our faith. 11,000 planes were ready, of which8,000 would go into action. We hoped that our superiority in the air wouldmake up for our lack of infantry. Therefore it would be sad to go into action without their aid. Our equipment was the best possible. All berths in britain were full; but we should hope later on to be able to open up the French ports to direct traffic across the Atlantic.General de Gaulle had asked to have an absolutely free right, to telegraph to Algiers in his own cypher. The Prime Minister hoped that he was quite sure that the cyphers were safe. As he had recognised General de Gaulle as the headof a great Empire,- he felt that it would be impossible for him not to have freeright of communication. At the same time he would like an assurance that no information of a Military kind about the date and place of the operation shouldbe imparted by the General to any of his colleagues except those actually present at the Meeting, if the General would give him such an assurance, he would take his word for it.GENERAL de GAULLE said that he must be free to keep in touch withAlgiers about operations in Italy.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that his remarks applied only to&quot; Overlord.&quot; He then explained the exact objectives of the operation. A veryconsiderable force would be sent to seize bases, ports and bridgeheads. Manywould sail from this country, but also, later on, many direct from the UnitedStates. There was now not much hope of beginning before D 4- 3, but thesituation would be reviewed every 24 hours. He had taken upon himself theresponsibility of entrusting General de Gaulle with our secret. By doing so, hehad enabled General Eisenhower to deal more freely with the technical aspectsof the operation. -GENERAL de GAULLE thanked the Prime Minister.   He said that the. operation was clearly an affair of momentous importance.   He had himself[27589]:     : $
thought that now was the moment to carry it out. He had not of course knownanything about the date before; but he felt that he should tell the PrimeiMinisterthat people in Algiers who listened to the messages transmitted in French bythe B.B.C. had inferred from the recent increase in such messages that it wasabout to begin.THE PRIME MINISTER said that such messages seemed to him unwise.We ourselves had done much in the way of deception and rumours, and whenthe Armada actually sailed it was proposed that a series of declarations shouldbe issued by General Eisenhower and by the rulers of such countries as the enemymight expect us to be about to attack. For example, there would be messagesfrom Queen Wilhelmina and King Haakon. He hoped that General de Gaullewould be ready to, send such a message to France. Originally, the declarationswould have had to have been made this evening; but now the General would have one or two days to prepare his. It need not be long, but it should be encouragingand designed to create uncertainty in the enemy camp.GENERAL de GAULLE said that he would be very glad to *do this, for two reasons. First, he considered that the operation was very important and well prepared. Secondly, he was glad to know that the reason why the PrimeMinister had invited him to come to this country was to inform him about theoperation. The question of the message would be easy to arrange. He assumed that after the battle was launched he would be able to return to Algiers.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it was true that the greatoperation now, impending had taken all our thoughts, but after it had been launched (or in the interval while it was retarded) we thought it would be useful to discuss certain political questions.GENERAL de GAULLE said that he felt that it was quite right that heshould be in this country at this moment, and he thanked the Prime Minister for having thought of inviting him now. It was important for the future of both our countries that we should be together when the operation began. That was why he had expressed his thanks.Any information which had been, or would be given about the operationAvould not be imparted by him to anyone other than his colleagues present atthe Meeting.TELE PRIME MINISTER said that as regards political matters he had beenin correspondence with the President for some time. The President had begunwith the idea of wanting General de Gaulle to come to the United States, buthe did not want to invite him formally. In his recent telegrams he had seemedless desirous of receiving a visit, partly because of the treatment accorded toGeneral Giraud. It should be remembered that the President had made thearrangement, about equipment for the French Forces with General Giraud; andGeneral Giraud had gone.GENERAL de GAULLE said that he thought that at this moment it was better that he should be here than in Washington.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he thought that this was true, so faras the beginning of the battle was concerned. Two French cruisers were taking-part. But in the interval we might discuss the question of the Administration of liberated France. He must warn the General that the part of France at firstliberated might not be big, and might contain only a few French people, underheavy fire. The President had said that General Marshall would be able to speak with General de Gaulle on all military affairs, but he had twice refused togive his consent to conversations between representatives of the three countries on political matters. The Prime Minister was free to talk a deux. But he felt sure that, if General de Gaulle were to express the wish to visit the President, hewould be made most welcome. We should be glad to forward such a message, andhe would suggest that when the battle was launched the General should send his representative in Washington to inform the President that he desired to come.But the President had been unwilling to send a representative to the presentconversations. .-THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had reason to believe that, if general de Gaulle were to say that he was willing to go to America, it was not impossible that we might be able to have preliminary discussions on political matters here, at which the American Ambassador could be present.
THE PRIME MINISTER assured General de Gaulle that, in his view, therewas nothing humiliating in the procedure suggested by the President. He him-self had on three or four occasions in the past told the President that he wouldlike to visit him; but the President had declined.  He had taken it en camarade.GENERAL de GAULLE said that he had sent back a message to thePresident by Admiral Fenard that he would like to visit him. He asked to bekept informed of developments since, as he understood it, the reason for his presence here was the battle.THE PRIME MINISTER said that so far as the public were concernedhe was thought to be here in order to discuss the problem of administration. Thisacted as camouflage for his visit, which was necessary and good. Apart from this,he himself had thought that it would be painful if the General were not to haveknowledge of the operation until the news became public. General Eisenhowerwould probably go into technical details with General de Gaulle and his officers.The operation was of vital importance to the United States and Great Britainand France, and he was sure that the General would feel that the secrecy of theinformation must be regarded as sacred. For this reason he was most anxious that no details about dates, &amp;c, should be telegraphed to Algiers. He sometimeshad the impression that the French cyphers were not absolutely safe.GENERAL de GAULLE assured the Prime Minister that there was absolutely no chance of, his telegraphing about such matters to Algiers.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that General de Gaulle had been invited to this country at this time in order that he might be informed of our plans before the battle.   But we were ready to speak about other problems.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, and said that the President had asked him to report on such conversations as might be held here,GENERAL de GAULLE said that he had no objection to the Presidentbeing informed. As, regards the general question, he must be frank. He was quite content about the battle, which he felt showed that the United States,Great Britain and France were all together. But on the practical question ofthe administration of territories he had difficulties. It seemed to him that weshould have concluded an agreement on this subject long ago, in fact last september.THE PRIME MINISTER said that whether or not General de Gaullevisited the President was a matter for the General himself to decide. But he himself strongly advised him to do so. After all,, the United States andGreat Britain were two great nations who were willing to risk the loss of scoresof thousands of their men in an operation designed to liberate France. He feltthat it was General de Gaulle&apos;s duty to do everything to bind these nations toFrance, and he would be very sorry for-France if General de Gaulle were to dootherwise. He must tell him bluntly that, if after every effort had been exhaustedthe President was on one side and the French National Committee of Liberationon the other, he, Mr. Churchill, would almost certainly side with the President,and that anyhow no quarrel would ever arise between Britain and the UnitedStates on account of France. As regards the Civil Affairs agreement, he wouldsum up the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government as follows : If General de Gaullewanted us to ask the President to agree to give him the title deeds of France,the answer was &quot; No.&quot; If he wanted us to ask the President to agree that theCommittee of National Liberation was the principal factor with whom we should deal in France, the answer was &quot; Yes,&quot;GENERAL de GAULLE said he quite understood that in case of disagree-ment between the Urn ted States and France, Great Britain would side with theUnited States.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had expressed his own personal opinion which he had little doubt would be endorsed by the House of commons in view of the relations subsisting throughout the Anglo-American society andbrotherhood-in-arms which nothing could break.
