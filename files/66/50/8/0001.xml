Printed for the War Cabinet. May 1944.secret.P. (44) 258.IQth May, 1944.)WAR CABINET.POLICY IN REGARD TO MALAYA AND BORNEO.Report of the Committee.WE were appointed by the War Cabinet at its meeting on the 6th January(W.M. (44) 2nd Conclusions) to consider the question of the constitutional policies to be followed in Malaya and in the British territories! in Borneo on their liberation, and to recommend a directive on which the authorities responsible for planning the Civil Administration of these territories after liberation can work.The composition of the Committee was as follows : :The Lord President of the Council (Chairman).The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.The Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Secretary of State for War.The Attorney-General.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.2. Malaya. A directive on the probable lines of future policy is indis-pensable for those who have the duty of planning the Civil Affairs policies andas a basis for the directive to be issued in due course on these matters to theSupreme Allied Commander, S.E.A.C.; and, on the understanding that no publicity is given to the policies contained therein, we are in agreement on theterms of the directive for this purpose, which form Appendix I to this report.3. Borneo. The four British territories concerned (North Borneo, Sarawak,Labuan and Brunei) are at present in a United States sphere of command, theS.W. Pacific. His Majesty&apos;s Government are entitled, under the terms of the charter of the Combined Civil Affairs Committee, to provide the AmericanCommander with directives on Civil Affairs policies in these British territories,and a directive on Civil Affairs will need to be framed at the appropriate timefor issue to him. But it is not our function to examine the form in which anysuch directive for that purpose will need to be framed. We have concernedourselves only with a directive on which the British planning staff should work.For this limited purpose we have agreed upon a directive in the terms of appendix II to this report.4. It will be noted that the Borneo directive proposes the acquisition byHis Majesty&apos;s Government from the British North Borneo (Chartered) company of its sovereign and administrative rights in North Borneo. We are of opinionthat confidential discussion for this purpose should be opened with the Courtof Directors of the Chartered Company, though we recognise that in the presentuncertain position as to the value of the Chartered Company&apos;s assets in the far east it would be premature to reach any agreement on the financial terms on which such a settlement could be reached.5, In the case of the Borneo directive, as in that of the Malayan, there isno question of any publicity being given to the policies beyond the confidential discussions which will be involved with the Chartered Company and the Rajahof Sarawak.[27462]Copy No.
6. To sum up, we accordingly recommend, with the proviso that no publicity for these policies is involved, that the Secretary of State for the Colonies beauthorised (a) To issue the directive at Appendix I to the authorities responsible for planning for the Civil Administration of Malaya on liberation;(b) To issue the directive at Appendix II to the British officials at presentplanning for Civil Administration in British Borneo after liberation;(c) To open confidential discussions with the Court of Directors of the british north Borneo (Chartered) Company with a view to coming to an understanding (without at this stage any financial commitment) asto the conditions on which the administration of North Borneo wouldbe transferred from the Compaiiy&apos;s responsibility and control to thatof His Majesty&apos;s Government; and(d) To open confidential discussions with the Rajah of Sarawak, who is- atpresent residing in this country, with a view to the preparation ofa new Agreement on the lines proposed in paragraph 3 (c) of appendix II attached.(On behalf of the Committee),(Signed) C. R. ATTLEE.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18th May, 1944.APPENDIX I.Draft Directive on Policy in Malaya.1. The restoration of the pre-war constitutional and administrative system will be undesirable in the interests of efficiency and security and of our declaredpurpose of promoting self-government in Colonial territories. The first of these interests requires a closer union of the territories comprising the relatively smallarea of the Malay Peninsula; and the second requires that self-government shouldnot merely develop towards a system of autocratic rule by the Malay Rulers but should provide for a growing participation in the Government by the people of allthe communities in Malaya, subject to a special recognition of the political,economic and social interests of the Malay race.2. On general grounds, and more particularly in order that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may be in a better position to ensure the development of the country on the lines indicated above, it isi necessary that the old position in which HisMajesty had no jurisdiction in the Malay States should&apos; be remedied and thatit should be possible to legislate for those States under the Foreign JurisdictionAct. Immediately on the reoccupation of Malaya, direct authority will beexercised by the Military Commander, who will carry with him sufficient authorityto enable him to exercise such direct powers and control over the territory as willbe necessary during the period of military administration. This military authority will, however, not enable His Majesty to legislate for the Malay states under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act and, moreover, the jurisdiction of theMilitary Commander will not persist when the military administration gives wayto a permanent civil administration.3. In considering the proper way to achieve these objects, it is necessary,on the one band, to make certain basic assumptionisi and, on the other hand, to beprepared to meet a situation when the liberation of Malaya has been effected, onwhich those assumptions1 may be found to be wrong or incomplete and inconsequence the prepared plans may have to be varifed. The future position and status of the Malay Rulers in particular cannot finally be judged before liberationwhen it will be possible to assess not only their individual records but also andespecially the attitude of the people of Malaya to the advantages or otherwise of. maintaining the Sultanates as institutions in the several States. For thepresent we have no reason for any other assumption than that the&apos;Sultanates asan institution will continue to enjoy the loyalty and traditional respect of the malays. &apos; ,
4. On that assumption, it is considered&apos; that the proper way to achieve our purpose will be to make fresh treaties with the Rulers under which suchjurisdiction would be ceded to His Majesty as would enable him to legislate forthe States under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. A fresh Treaty with each Rulershould for this single purpose be concluded on behalf of His Majesty as soon asfeasible after reoccupation. The actual signatory of such Treaties on behalfof His Majesty would appropriately be the G.O.C., but the negotiations wouldbe carried on under instructions from the Secretary of State for the Colonies by civil Affairs Officers or special representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government,subject always to the proviso that the actual time for opening negotiations withthe Rulers must be governed by Military exigencies and left to the discretion ofthe Military Commander.5. The acquisition of this Jurisdiction by His Majesty will enable anOrder-in-Council to be made to provide for the future central and local govern-ment of the country. This jurisdiction will render unnecessary any furtherdependence on Treaties with Rulers in any future revision of the constitutional arrangements.6. The new constitutional arrangements for Malaya should provide for thespecial treatment of the port and Island of Singapore, in the early stages at anyrate, in view of its distinctive characteristics in the Malayan picture.7. The rest of the peninsula, including the British Settlements of Penangand Malacca, should be constituted a Malayan Union. For the Malayan unions constitution should be devised which would provide for a single united authorityrepresenting the States and the Settlements, subject to the jurisdiction of HisMajesty under statutory powers. At the head of the Union Government wouldbe a Governor with an Executive and a Legislative Council. The seat of this government would conveniently be in or near Kuala Lumpur.8. The co-ordination and direction of the policies of Government in the malayan Union and Singapore will be secured by the appointment of a&quot;Governor-General&quot; at Singapore, with the power of control over the localAuthorities in Malaya and Borneo.9. Co-operation in all administrative matters requisite between singapore and the Union will be ensured by particular agreements for joint consultation and action.10. On the assumption explained in paragraph 3 it will be no part of thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the. Malay Rulers should lose their personal position in their State territories. Indeed, it will be the intention, that,ty the association of their territories in the Union, the Rulers will have oppor-tunities to take part in wider activities than hitherto for the general advantageof the country as1 a whole, and may thereby enhance their sphere of influence and prestige in Malaya.APPENDIX IT.Draft Directive on Policy-Borneo.(North Borneo, Labuan, Brunei and Sarawak.)1. The restoration of the pre-war constitutional and administrative systemsin the four, territories will be undesirable in the interests of security and of ourdeclared purpose of promoting social, economic and political progress in&apos; colonial territories.These purposes require  -.(&amp;) The direct assumption by His Majesty&apos;s Government of responsibility for administration in North Borneo.(6) The integration of Labuah with North Borneo. *:v(c) The cession to His Majesty of. full jurisdiction in Brunei and Sarawak.The purpose of political progress requires also that self-government in Bruneiand Sarawak should not merely develop towards systems of autocratic rule but should provide for a growing participation in the Government by people of all communities in each territory. &apos;      &quot;
2. On general grounds, and more particularly in order that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may be in a better position to ensure the development of the country on the lines indicated above, it is necessary that the old position in which HisMajesty had not full jurisdiction in these territories, with the exception ofLabuan, should be remedied and that it should be possible to legislate for the mall by Order-in-Council. Immediately on the reoccupation of these territories,direct authority will be exercised by the Military Commander, who will carry with him sufficient authority to enable him to exercise such direct powers andcontrol over the territories as will be necessary during the period of military administration. This military authority, even if it fell to be exercised by a british commander, would, however, not enable His Majesty to legislate for the threeStates, North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak, by Order-in-Council, and, in any case,the jurisdiction of the Military Commander &quot;would not persist when the military administration gave way to a permanent civil administration.3. It is considered that the most effective way to achieve our purposeswill be :  , , ,(a) To acquire from the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company the sovereign and administrative rights which they possess and havehitherto exercised; and thereafter to provide for the future govern-ment of the territory on its liberation by an Administration under the. direct authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(6) To incorporate the present Settlement of Labuan in the new Administra-tion for North Borneo./ - : (c) To conclude new treaties with the. Sultan of &quot;Brunei and the Rajah of sarawak at the earliest opportunity whichwill accord to His Majestysuch jurisdiction in their States as will enable His Majesty to legislate for these territories under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to the efullest extent. In the case of Sarawak, the new treaty should also secure theacceptance by the Rajah of a resident British Adviser whose advicemust be sought and acted upon in all substantial matters of policyand administration. (The present treaty with Brunei already providesfor a resident British Adviser.) ..3. The territories in Borneo are still comparatively undeveloped and theyhave few racial or other affinities. At this stage, therefore, the basis for close reunion between them hardly exists. Community of policy and of administrative action can, however, be assured from the outset under the direction of theGovernor-General at Singapore, whose appointment is recommended and the promotion of closer union should be a continuing matter of our policy.
