Printed for the War Cabinet.  May 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 277.28th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR INTERNAL AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.AS the War Cabinet are aware, the whole subject of post-war air transport,both in the international and in the domestic field; continues to attract the keenestattention.2. A statement of the principles which the Government proposed to advocatein the international field was made in both Houses of Parliament early last year,and a number of Ministerial statements have since been made about the discussionwith the Dominions and, more recently, with Mr. Berle of the United states administration. Parliament and the public are aware that we are now ready and intend to go forward to a full international conference as soon as this can bearranged.3. There are, of course, complex subjects on which we have yet to annouce our policy. Among these is that of the future of the State-owned. British overseas airways Corporation and the allied question whether private interests, e.g., theshipping companies, should be allowed to participate. Papers on this lattersubject are now before the War Cabinet.4. In the field of internal civil aviation also, we must expect to be pressed fora statement of Government policy.5. On the official level, a great deal of post-war planning on the subject ofinternal civil aviation has been done by the Air Ministry, both within theDepartment and in consultation with other Departments. The issues have beendefined and decisions will have to be taken on such matters as the arrangementsfor the operation of regular internal air services, the development of airfields, thecontrol and licensing of charter, flying, the encouragement and regulation ofprivate and club flying and of gliding, the standards of qualification to be required of civil aircrew, the amendment of the air navigation regulations and theregulations affecting air safety.6. The first and most important issue, as well as the most controversial, is whether civil air lines in this country should be operated by private enterprise which in^practice will mean chiefly the railway companies-or whether theyshould be operated by a Public Corporation.7. I have been reluctant to bring this issue to the Cabinet for decision,especially at this stage of the war. It seemed to me that, if it were to be treatedas a political issue, it would give rise to prolonged discussion and that it wouldbe difficult to reach agreement.&apos; My intention, therefore, was to refer this issue and the other practical questions, which I have mentioned, to an &quot; outside &quot;committee, which would include, among others, representatives of the threepolitical parties and would have a strong Chairman. I had found a Chairmanwho, by COmmOn consent, possessed all the necessary qualifications of character and experience, An independent committee of this kind would take evidence fromthe many interests concerned and, withcut being dominated by political considerations, would work out the policy calculated to provide efficient air transport services for the people of these islands. This method of examining the issues and consulting the interests concerned is in accordance with precedent.[27538] b
8. On the other hand,, several of my colleagues have insisted that it is time that the Cabinet took a decision on what they regard as the main issue, whether these internal air services are to be operated by private enterprise or by a public corporation. They think that Parliament would regard the appointment of an&quot;outside&quot; committee before this main issue of policy had been decided as adevice to shirk a decision.9. I believe, on the other hand, that the opportunity of helping to workout a policy would be agreeable to Members of Parliament and that the appoint-ment of the committee would be accepted as an outward and visible sign that theproblem was under active review. The report of the committee, even if notunanimous, would at least clarify the issues for public discussion and might suggest a practical solution which would meet with general acceptance.10.   I attach a memorandum in which (a) the salient features of the pre-war position and the arrangements whichhave been in force during the war are reviewed; and(&amp;) the pros and cons of the various courses which might be adopted for theoperation and development of internal air services in the post-war-period are examined.The conclusion appears to be inescapable that the right course in all thecircumstances is to establish a public Corporation for the operation of all internalair services after the war.11.   I therefore invite the War Cabinet either (a) to endorse this conclusion in which case I would arrange for thepreparation of a di&apos;aft White Paper; or(.&amp;) to agree to the appointment of an &quot;outside&quot; committee.A. H, M. S.Air Ministry,28th May, 1944.POST-WAR INTERNAL AIR TRANSPORT.Survey of Past and Present Position and Recommendations for future Policy.A. Pre-war Position.1. It is unnecessary in this paper to go back beyond the Maybury Committeewhich was appointed in 1935 to consider measures which might be- adopted bythe Government or by local authorities for promoting civil aviation in the UnitedKingdom.2. The Committee reviewed the operations of internal air services betweenthe years 1933 and 1936 and concluded that either the services then operating-had not met the demand for air transport or that an effective demand did. not exist on the routes operated. The Committee considered that successful airlinesmust offer services (i) fast and frequent enough to show a substantial saving in time overother methods of travel and at reasonable cost;(ii) at convenient hours, and(iii) as regular and punctual as other means of transport.3. Under these conditions and with good management, it was not only possible but highly probable that air services on suitable routes could be made topay. These conditions would not obtain in the United Kingdom until, among other things, cut-throat competition had been eliminated. The committee therefore recommended that, as an experiment, an exclusive licence should begiven to a single company or combination of companies to operate a network of services termed the &apos;&apos; J unction Aerodrome System &apos;&apos;; and that a licensing authority should be appointed to select the company or Companies to be licensedfor this purpose, as well as to license operators on other routes.
4. For various reasons, the postulates of the Maybury Committee as out-lined above had not been achieved by 1939. The overall speeds of air journeyswithin the British Isles had shown no marked increase for several years andthe frequency, regularity and punctuality of the services were not comparable with those of other means of travel except on some routes which crossed the sea.No regular air services were operated at night. The result was that in the fouryears preceding the outbreak of war, there was no substantial increase in theactivities of the operating companies. Indeed, passengers carried on regularinternal air services fell from 155,000 in 1936 to 149,000 in 1938, although thecorresponding figures for aircraft miles flown were 2,726,000 and 3,079,000respectively.5. The. &quot; Junction Aerodrome System&quot; recommended by the MayburyCommittee did not come into existence because no air transport company was willing to undertake the experiment of operating it. The recommendationregarding the regulation of air services was. however, accepted by the Governmentof the day and the Air Transport Licensing Authority was established by Order-in-Council in 1938. The jurisdiction of the Authority applied to all air journeyswithin the United Kingdom on which passengers or goods were carried for payment and extended to air journeys made between the United Kingdom andthe Channel Islands, and between the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man.Charter services and pleasure flights from and returning to the same aerodromewithout intermediate landing were excluded.6. In May, 1938, it was announced that the Government proposed to grantExchequer assistance to internal companies, &quot; to help those companies whichwere suffering losses to establish themselves on a sound commercial footing andto enable all of them to press on with their services with even greater enterprise.&quot;A White Paper (Cmd. 5894) was subsequently laid before Parliament which contained proposals for the payment of an Exchequer subsidy not exceeding 100,000 per annum for a period of five years. The proposal was approved byParliament and came into effect as from the 1st January, 1939.7. By the middle of 1939, the Licensing Authority had issued 47 licences tosome 14 of the then existing companies for periods up to seven years. TheAuthority was dissolved shortly after the outbreak of war, and the licences ithad issued died with it.B.  War-time Position.8. At the outbreak of war, civil flying ceased in the United Kingdom and civil aircraft and crews were employed for a time on war communication duties under the aegis of a single organisation called National Air Communications.Later, a number of civil air services, considered essential in the national interest,,were re-established, but only six of the pre-war companies are at present operatingand all but one of these six are controlled by the railway interests. The remainingcompanies are engaged on repair and maintenance work for the Ministry of aircraft Production, though the majority want to resume airline operations assoon as conditions permit.C. The Traffic Demand.Pre-war experience.9. The extent of the public demand for air travel in the United kingdom was analysed by the Maybury Committee who reached the following conclusions : &apos;(i) The greater speed and convenience of air services operating over wateras compared with surface travel had attracted a substantial travel-ling public. The traffic was, however, seasonal with marked peaks andthere was only a comparatively small amount of commercial traffic which required facilities for air travel throughout the year.(ii) Apart from these over-water services, the extent to which one methodof transport can economically and in practice be substituted for another is limited.(iii)&apos; Out of the total traffic offering between any two points in this country,only a small proportion would demand, or be able to bear, the highercost of air travel.   The proportion was likely to be highest between&apos;   large centres of population.    Between such centres, however, well-developed surface transport facilities were already available.[27538] b 2
(iv) A demand for speed was to be found on routes connecting the principalmanufacturing and trading centres and, where such routes were sufficiently long, airlines should be able to attract remunerativebusiness.10. The Committee saw no reason for discouragement in their conclusions.They felt that technical advances might well bring about a substantial change andthat efficient air transport services would create their own traffic.American experience.11. While the rapid and extensive devekypment of internal services in theUnited States is largely due to -the great distances separating the large centres of population in that country, it* is significant that internal air services in theUnited States have attracted substantial numbers of travellers over comparatively short distances and in competition with fast, frequent and comfortable railway services. For example, in September 1940 some 672 passengers on an averagetravelled daily by air between New York and Boston. This represents about16 per cent, of the passengers carried by railways between these two points. Thetwo cities are 184 miles apart and were linked by 22 air services and 23 railway services a day in each direction. Even between two cities as close as Philadelphiaand New York (95 miles) some 20,000 passengers were annually carried by air.It seems reasonable to conclude from this that efficient air transport services between large centres of population, even when comparatively close together, canattract traffic in the face of severe competition from the,railways and the roads.Effect of recent technical developments.12. The war has acted as a forcing-house for development in many branchesof aeronautical science, and many of the new devices which have been producedto meet an immediate military requirement can be readily adapted though therewill be a time lag for the purposes of civil air transport. Of these developments,the main are perhaps the following : (i) Improved radio aids to navigation, and improved air traffic controlfacilities;(ii) Improved aids to the approach and landing of aircraft in bad visibility;.(iii) Improved anti-icing equipment for aircraft;(iv) Higher cruising speeds; and(v) Larger and more efficient airfields with improved equipment.13. The application of these developments to civil air transport will leadto greater regularity of services and to quicker flights between stopping points.Further, with the development pf surface communications from the centres ofour main cities to their outskirts, quicker journeys to and from airports will bepossible, thus reducing substantially the overall time of a journey from the centre of one city to the centre of another.14. Without taking evidence from a large number of local authorities andfrom commercial and other interests it is impossible to assess precisely what thedemand for internal air transport will be after the war. It can be assumed,however, that air services in this country will be required (i) to meet the needs of commerce by providing swift transport facilitiesbetween centres of population and industry;(ii) to provide more generally a measure of extra speed and convenience oversurface communications;(iii) to provide in the public interest essential communications with isolatedareas which are not well served by surface transport, e.g., the WesternIslands of Scotland; and(iv) to provide connections with terminals of international air services.D. Scope of State Assistance.15.   The problem of subsidy assistance is of fundamental importance.Pre-war position.16. The initial development of internal air services was left to privateenterprise operating under conditions of free competition. It was not until 1938that the Licensing Authority was established.  From the 1st January, 1939, direct
I p.180subsidy was first paid to internal airlines. The State had for some years, how-ever, provided indirect subsidy in the form of free signals and meteorologicalfacilities and free air traffic control at airfields, without which air services cannotbe operated with safety or regularity.17. The cost to the Exchequer of providing these ancillary facilities was estimated to amount to some  350,000 in respect of capital expenditure and tosome  312,000 in repect of annual costs. On the basis of the pre-war mileageflown by the internal operators, this amounted to a hidden subsidy of the orderi of Is. Qd. per aircraft mile flown or 2d. per passenger mile on a fully-loaded ten-I seater aircraft.18. The 1939 scheme for direct subsidy was limited to a period of five years,after which it was hoped that no further direct subsidy would be required.Payment was to be made at a rate diminishing annually, based on aircraft capacity and mileage flown, and no account was taken of the financial results of the operating companies or of operating conditions.19. At the outbreak of war, when the undertakings of the companies were placed at the disposal of the Secretary of State, the subsidy scheme lapsed. Theonly services which are now in operation are meeting essential war needs. Theyare, with one exception, operated under the aegis of a single organisation called the associated Airways Joint Committee which is railway-controlled. The companies are reimbursed under a contract which allows them to make up to but not morethan 4 per cent, on the capital employed.Post-war position.20. There were obvious defects in the pre-war subsidy scheme which neednot be discussed in detail in this paper, It did not, for instance, discriminate between remunerative and Unremunerative services and was not related to anyconsidered plan for the development of air services in the national interest.21. It seems probable that, after the w^ar, the internal air services requiredin this Country will fall into two main categories, i.e.: (i) those which provide a measure of extra speed and convenience oversurface communications; and(ii) those which are required on grounds of public interest, e.g., those whichserve parts of the country where surface communications are poor or donot exist.22. It is safe to say that services in category (ii) are unlikely to come into existence at all unless supported, at any rate for a term of years, by directExchequer subsidy in addition to indirect subsidy in the form of free facilities.The case for subsidising services in category (i) is much less strong, and it seems reasonable to assume that, at any rate on certain routes, they could be made to pay,always provided that the State continued to provide free facilities.E. Organisation.23. So much for the background. What arrangements are to be madefor the operation of internal air services after the war ? Leaving aside thepossibility of direct operation by a Government Department, which, thoughfeasible, is not likely to be acceptable, the alternatives would seem to be :  (i) unregulated competition;(ii) competition  between  commercial  companies regulated  by an air transport Licensing Authority on the lines of that established in 1938;(iii) competition between commercial companies regulated by an authority which, in addition to the powers enjoyed by the pre-war Authority,would functi on cis Bi planning and development authority as well;(iv) a merger (compulsory, if necessary) of the independent air companiesinto two or three companies registered under the Companies Act.An Authority might still be retained, or its powers to regulate andplan might be vested in the Secretary-of State for Air;(v) the registration of a single operating company on which would be conferred by statute a monopoly of internal air services. The Govern-ment might be represented on the Board;[27538] b 3
(vi) the registration of a single holding company, which would have acontrolling interest in the various operating companies, wouldnegotiate with the Air Ministry in all matters affecting subsidy, routes to be operated and so on;(vii) the establishment by statute of a single holding organisation whichwould exercise the functions referred to in (vi) above but would be constituted a Public Corporation, financed by fixed-interest bearingstock, which would be guaranteed as to capital and interest by theTreasury, and would carry no equity value,(viii) the establishment by statute of a single operating organisation whichwould be constituted as a Public Corporation and financed by fixed-interest bearing stock, guaranteed as to capital and interest by theTreasury and carrying no equity value. The Corporation would beresponsible for commercial management but would be subject to policy control by the Secretary of State for Air.24. The pros and cons of these alternatives are set out in the following paragraphs.Unregulated Competition ((i) of paragraph 23).25. This would mean a reversion to the pre-1938 position and the objectionsare so obvious that it is hardly necessary to traverse them in detail. The observa-tions of the Maybury Committee, in paragraph 3 above, are still valid. Withoutthe control of a Licensing Authority, there would be cut-throat competition andthe prospects of any air services becoming self-supporting would, be remote.There would sooner or later be a demand for direct Exchequer assistance and theState would then either have to refuse a subsidy and see internal air services inthis country emasculated by civil war, or, as a condition of the grant of a subsidy,would have to insist on at least that measure of control, through licensing, whichwas introduced in 1938.Regulated Competition ((ii) and. (iii) of paragraph 23).26 Both these courses avoid the anarchic and, wasteful conditions ofunregulated competition, but formidable objections remain.   The main are (a) Air transport is a business requiring substantial capital resources ifvigorous, efficient and up-to-date services are to be provided. Asaeronautical science advances and aircraft become more complicated,the cost of equipment increases. Companies with small resourceswill not be able after the war to equip themselves with the best types of aircraft, nor to replace aircraft in use as soon as may be desirable.(&amp;) Economy and efficiency are best obtained in large units. The majorAmerican domestic airlines have shown what can be achieved in termsof flying hours per year per aircraft with first-class maintenance and first-class organisation. First-class maintenance establishments, how-ever, call for a large initial outlay which a large operating unit is better able to provide and use more intensively than a small unit.Again, a small operating unit is rarely able to attract or, if it doesattract, to keep first-class business administrators.(c) The essence of all successful transport operation is to keep the vehiclesmoving. A large organisation, operating on a number of routes, canswitch its aircraft from route to route to meet peak loads, thus mini-economising costs. jid) On main routes, where surface facilities are good, the airlines may feel obliged to replace their aircraft at fairly short intervals. This doesnot mean that the aircraft replaced are incapable of further useful work on feeder or subsidiary services. A large organisation opera-ting a number of services of all types is better able to provide for theobsolescence of its aircraft over a long period without reducing theefficiency of its main services than a small organisation whose scopeis restricted.(e) If our domestic airlines are to achieve anything like the standard ofthe domestic airlines in the U.S.A., they will have to display the sameinitiative and drive. Large units with substantial capital resources are better able to do this and can wait, if necessary, for a return ontheir outlay.
(/) A multiplicity of companies inevitably means a multiplication of over-heads, e.g., directors&apos; fees, much of which could be saved byamalgamation:27. A Licensing Authority which is empowered merely to adjudicate onapplications cannot pursue a policy of development. It can be argued that responsibility for pursuing a forward policy rests with the Government Depart--ment concerned. New services involving Exchequer assistance would in any caserequire the approval of Ministers. That is true. There would be advantages,however if a number of private companies were allowed to operate in arrang-ing for the Licensing Authority, which would rapidly become a repository of knowledge on all aspects of internal aviation, to be charged with the additionalresponsibility of planning and development. Local authorities, commercial andindustrial interests and others who felt that particular areas were inadequatelyserved would state their case to the Authority who, if satisfied that there wassubstance in the representations, would state a case to the Secretary of state with a recommendation as to how the unfilled need could best be met and at whatcost. But in the last analysis the introduction of a service desired by the licensed-sing Authority and endorsed by the Secretary of State would depend upon the willingness of private interests to provide it at a price which the State wouldbe prepared to pay.Rationalisation under the Companies Act ( (iv), (v) and (vi) of paragraph 23).28. These alternatives would avoid, to a large extent, the main drawbacksof a system which merely regulated competition and took no account of overallefficiency in terms of the industry as a whole. The concentration of reserves and saving in overheads which would be achieved by rationalisation are impor-tant. The only argument for having two or three airline concentrations insteadof one would seem to be that competition, even when much reduced, is a goodthing. It is doubtful if this argument is of much validity in the case of internalair transport where it is unlikely that more than one airline would operate onany one route. The two or three organisations allowed to operate would be allotted spheres of interest and the competition would be not so much between the airlines as between air and surface transport. The truth is that competition between air and surface transport will provide all the incentive necessary tospur on a single operating organisation to its best endeavours, always providedthat the organisation is not itself controlled by surface transport interests.29. If then, as the argument shows, a single organisation is preferable toa plurality of companies, what form should the single organisation take ?30. To consider first the two kinds of single company, i.e., the singleoperating and the single holding company ((v) and (vi) above). Here the questionimmediately arises whether surface transport interests should participate. It is claimed in favour of participation that to bring them in would help to achieve a balanced system of transport, that they can contribute great experience oftransport problems and that it would be unfair to exclude them. The case forthe railway companies was well put by Lord Kennet in the House of Lords onthe 10th May on the following lines : (i)&apos; &quot;. . . . the railway companies are no longer railway companies :  theyare  great   corporations   for   the   development   of   all   sorts   of transportation.....    These great corporations are in the best position indeed, only they are in a good position to co-coordinate the old means of transport with the new &apos;&apos;;(ii) Before the war the railway companies showed initiative in developingair services in what was an &apos;&apos; experimental and developing period,&apos;&apos;and that more would certainly have been done in developing services to the Continent had it not been for the competition of subsidisedforeign companies;(iii) During the war the railway companies have operated the air servicesentrusted to them with marked efficiency, of which their record of95 per cent, regularity is proof;(iv) They have the experience and the personal  contacts with  thoseexperienced in both engineering on the one hand and in labouradministration on the other, and these assets can only be built upover the years. Further, their knowledge of mail contract business isunsurpassed and their staffs have had a long and severe drilling in thehighest standards of safety; and
(v) It is a &quot;most vain imagination&quot; to suppose that, if the railwaycompanies are allowed to have a hand in the nurture of civil aviation,they would turn out to be &quot; most unkindly stepmothers.&quot;31. What validity there is in these arguments is largely a matter of personaljudgment. There are, however, important and, to my mind, conclusive arguments on the other side : (i) There is a strong feeling in many quarters that the railway companies,whatever they might profess, are interested in air transport not forits own sake as a new form of travel with a great future, but tosafeguard their own position; and that the companies would never develop air services which were likely seriously to interfere withrailway interests. The emphasis which the companies are nowplacing on the operation of post-war services to the Continent as farafield as Warsaw and Budapest as opposed to internal services lendssupport to this view.(ii) The following extract from the Report on Post-War Civil Aviationrecently published by the Association of Municipal Corporations isworth quoting in this connection : &quot; Our past experience of railway air services has led us tothe conclusion that the most efficient development of civil air transport services is not likely to result if the operation of those services is left to an organisation representative of a competitiveand rival mode of transport. We had some small experience ofthe methods adopted by the railway air services before the war,and we are not satisfied that the development of airline services will be carried out to the best advantage by them. We make this statement with a full consciousness of its import in the conviction that it is a correct assessment of the situation.&quot;If the public interest is to be best served, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that air and surface transport should be entrusted to separate agencies who would devote themselves wholeheartedly to thedevelopment of that form of travel in which they specialise, co-ordina-tion being achieved by the responsible Ministers, with the assistance, as necessary, of an Advisory Board (see later), for which there are manyprecedents.The Canadian Government have recently announced that they will allow no railway company to operate air services or any air company to be connected in any way with surface transport interests. TheUnited States Administration have adopted the same policy. Thesetwo Governments are not likely to have taken this action without good cause. It is safe to say that the marked success achieved by the domestic airlines in the United States would not have been achieved,had the railways had a controlling interest in them.32. What then are the relative advantages of a single company which would itself operate all internal services and a single company which could act as a holding company and control operating subsidiaries, surface transport interestsin both cases being excluded ?33. If internal air transport were so huge an undertaking that one organisa-tion could not itself control day-to-day activities over the whole field without lossof efficiency, the case for a holding company would be increased. It will be manyyears, however, before internal air transport becomes as large an undertaking asthat, say, of Imperial Airways and British Airways when they were amalgamatedinto a single Public Corporation by the Act of 1939. While there are clearlyadvantages in having a single holding company instead of a number of.independent companies, it is a reasonable claim that a single operating companycould be as efficient and achieve the result at lower cost.Rationalisation by Public Corporation ((vii) and (viii) of paragraph 23).34. The arguments in the previous paragraph also apply in considering therelative advantages of a Public holding Corporation and a Public operatingCorporation.35. What then are the relative merits of a single operating company (whoseprofits might be limited) and a Public operating Corporation ?
36. The case for a company, financed by private investment, whose shareswould carry an equity value, appears to rest, mainly if not entirely, on the merits of private enterprise. A company (so it must be argued) with private share-holders whose money is at stake will show greater efficiency and liveliness than a corporation whose stock is guaranteed by the Treasury. Against this, it is true to say that experience with the British Overseas Airways Corporation shows that,even under the restraints of war, a Corporation which is subject only to policy andoverhead financial control by the Minister concerned, and is itself responsible for commercial management, can show as much enterprise and efficiency as a joint-stock undertaking. Again, the ideal of public service is comparatively young inthe field of industry and commerce. Nevertheless, it is taking root, and we areentitled to assume that loyalty to the public interest can and will be as&apos;keen aspur to efficiency as loyalty to the interest of shareholders.37. There are other considerations which are less matters of personal opinion : (a) If an efficient net-work of internal air services is to be provided in thiscountry after the war which will serve the needs of all districts andthe public demand for this may be irresistible various services willbe required in the national interest, and some of these, at any rate,will need direct Exchequer assistance for many years to come. Theexperience of successive- Governments with Imperial Airways showsthat relations between the State and a public company which is in. receipt of subsidy are never happy. The Board of a public company,even if one or two of the directors are Government nominees, is responsible primarily to its shareholders. The criticism of theCadman Committee that the Managing Director of Imperial Airwayshad taken too narrow a commercial view of his responsibilities was acriticism not so much of him or of his Board they were, after all,merely discharging their main responsibility but of the system. Ifa man cannot serve two masters, the same is true of a company. Itcannot put first both the public interest and the interest of itsshareholders.(b) The fixing of a fair and equitable subsidy for a particular servicerequired in ,the national interest would inevitably, as it was withImperial Airways, be a matter of great difficulty. The company wouldargue that the profits it made on the good routes should not be takeninto account when fixing subsidies for the unprofitable ones. In anycase, it would insist and with private shareholders it would be bound to insist that the subsidy paid for the operation of non-profitable routes required in the public interest should allow asubstantial profit margin, given efficiency of operation. Even ifprovision were made for limitation of profits, the upper limit could hardly be less than 5 per cent, as compared with the 3 per cent, returnwhich would be fully adequate in the case of the guaranteed stock ofa Public Corporation. The cost of raising capital would also be greater. Unless, therefore, the management of the company werenotably more efficient than the management of a public corporation and this would not necessarily or even probably be the case- the costto the State of the air services required, in the national interest would inevitably be higher.(c) Even if air transport developed so rapidly after the war that a privatemonopoly company was able to make sufficient profit on its goodservices to operate the unprofitable services required in the national interest without direct subsidy, and still pay the maximum dividend,on its shares which it was allowed to pay -and on no other conditions would it agree to operate unprofitable, services without subsidy thefact remains that, but for hidden subsidy (free facilities, &amp;c.) providedby the State, no profits could be earned at all. Thus, the State will certainly be required, if internal air services are to continue, to providea free signals and meteorological system and free air traffic controlfacilities as it did before the war. The cost of these facilities as trafficincreases and the aids grow in complexity will, however, increaseappreciably. Again, if the company operates British aircraft -andpublic opinion will insist on this-much of the development work willhave been done in. Government-financed research establishments. Isit not reasonable that the State should enjoy the benefits?
38. The conclusion appears to be inescapable that the right course in allthe circumstances is to establish a Public Corporation to operate the internalair services of this country.P. Co-ordination of Air and Surface Transport.39. Reference has been made in paragraph 31 to the desirability ofestablishing some machinery for co-ordinating the interests of air and surface transport where they overlap. Co-ordination is particularly important wheresubsidised air services are in a position to compete with unsubsidised surface transport undertakings. Unless all forms of transport in.this country are to be operated by a single organisation and the objections to any such scheme are obvious the final direction of internal air services must rest with the Secretaryof State for Air. He would, of course, be in frequent consultation with theMinisters responsible for other forms of transport In order, however, that hemay have before him, in making his decisions, a full and impartial appraisal ofthe various considerations involved, and that the interests affected may have a full opportunity of stating their case in public, it would be an advantage if an outsidebody were set up to advise him.40. The Advisory Body would consider questions affecting the co-ordinationof air and, surface transport and act as a forum before which persons interestedin the use and development of air services or affected by them could present their views. Thus, in addition to hearing representatives from the surface transport interests on any points where they considered themselves affected byunfair competition, it would consider the value of air services to the community as a whole and would advise the Secretary of State, after taking evidence fromall concerned, on such questions as routes, services, frequencies, and rates to becharged.41. The members should, be appointed by the Secretary of State afterconsultation with the Minister of Transport, the Treasury and any other minister concerned. The Body might consist of an independent Chairman and, say, five members with expert knowledge of, but not acting as representatives of, rail,shipping and air transport and of user interests in the widest sense.G. Is there an interim solution?42. The end of the war in Europe will provide a favourable opportunityfor establishing without undue difficulty that form of organisation for theoperation of our internal air services which is best suited to serve the long-term interests of the country. As explained above, a number of companies which were operating internal air services before the war have been compelled to cease opera-tions and those which are continuing are operating on the basis of special war-time arrangements made with the Air Ministry. The Air Navigation (restriction in Time of War) Order is unlikely to continue in force for more than three-months after the end of hostilities in Europe. Thereafter, the pre-war companies which wish to recreate their undertakings and new companies which wish toenter the business will be free to do so if the Air Transport Licensing authority is not immediately re-established. Even if it is, it is most improbable that parliament would give it power to refuse licences merely in order to preventcertain companies from establishing themselves pending the introduction of theGovernments long-term policy. Accordingly, a number of companies would succeed in re-establishing themselves or in entering the field for the first time andthe process of liquidating them later when the Government of the day had decided on its long-term policy would be both troublesome and expensive. Thereis therefore no interim solution which is not open to cogent objection.
