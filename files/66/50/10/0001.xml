Allied Minelaying.20. Surface craft have laid mines off the north coast of France and theDutch coast. Aircraft laid mines in the Baltic, off the German North Sea coast,the north coast of France and the Biscay ports.In the Mediterranean surface craft laid mines off the west coast of Italy.   .Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.21.   Minelaying by aircraft was suspected on two nights of the week in the.Portsmouth area.The mine totals are 4,776 ground and 4,638 moored.In the Mediterranean, aircraft laid mines on one night off Anzio.

There have been four arrivals at Bilbao and two sailings of the largerships engaged in the ore trade.A Hungarian shipping company, the only Danube company remainingoutside German control, is reported to have had its entire fleet requisitioned bythe German authorities.MILITARY SITUATION.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)23.   At 2300 hours on the 11th, the Eighth and Fifth Armies resumed the offensive against the Gustav line.24. The Polish Corps, attacking N.W. of Cassino, made some initial gainsbut, after very fierce enemy counter-attacks, were driven back on the 13th to theirstarting line where they reorganised for further attacks. These came on the17th when the same features previously captured were retaken and held, and fighting for two other points nearby was in progress. The Poles have had to contend with probably the best German troops in Italy, those of the 1st ParachuteDivision, and the enemy has shown the most violent reactions to these Polishthrusts.25. South of Cassino, British and Imperial forces successfully crossed theRapido and bridges and ferries were working early enough to allow about50 tanks to cross the river by mid-day on the 12th. On the 13th, S. Angelo wastaken and Pignataro fell to us on the 15th, which meant that the Cassino-S. Giorgio road had been cut. The reserve divisions of this Corps have now beenbrought into our Rapido bridgehead, and the bridgehead extends westwardsfrom the river to a depth of about 3J miles. The latest news is that the two infantry formations between S. Angelo and Cassino have attacked north-west-wards towards the railway and Highway 6, and one division has carriers onHighway 6, to the south of the Monastery. The gap between our forward troopshere and the Polish Corps on the other side of the hills is only 2,000 yards.26. The most spectacular progress of the whole offensive has been made bythe French Corps, who, despite an unpromising start on the 12th, when theyencountered stiff enemy resistance, quickly captured Monte major, and thenveered north and west to occupy S. Appollinare, S. Giorgio and the whole southernbank of the Liri, and Ausonia, Esperia and M. d&apos;Oro, the last of which lies only IPfour miles short of the Adolf Hitler Line. The French have been supported intheir advance by US. tank groups, but the greater part of the advance has been over country of the most mountainous description.27. The U.S. Corps, on the coastal sector, advanced slowly to cut theAusonia-Coast road and then went ahead to include Spigno and Mt. Petrella, aheight 2 miles west of Spigno. Last reports indicate that U.S. forces are closeupon Formia, the port in the Gulf of Gaeta.28. Generally speaking, our casualties have not been unreasonably heavy,but the enemy has probably lost more than 3,000 prisoners and will have suffered
heavily in killed and wounded. Considering the difficulties of the country, thestubbornness of the enemy&apos;s resistance and the strength of his defences, whichhe has had time to improve and strengthen, our offensive can be said to haveenjoyed, so far, a fair measure of success.Russo-German Campaign.29. Only local activity has been reported. The Germans claim to haveeliminated two Russian bridgeheads across the Lower Dniester, but the russians have only reported attacks against one bridgehead, N.W. of Tiraspol, and statethat these were repulsed.The Russians have announced heavy enemy losses both in men and equipmentduring the short campaign in the Crimea. The equipment destroyed or capturedincluded 299 tanks and S.P. guns, 578 aircraft, 3,079 guns of all calibres and7,086 motor vehicles.Yugoslavia.30. The Partisan Battle Group of two divisions, which has recently been operating in Serbia, has now swung to the north and is operating in the area ofValjevo (40 miles south of Belgrade).In West Bosnia the Germans, in the course of a drive southwards, have captured the town and iron mine of Ljubija (35 miles west of Banjaluka).Fighting has continued in East Bosnia, where the Germans have recapturedVlasenica (35 miles N.E. of Sarajevo) and in the area S.E. of Ljublana, where aPartisan counter-offensive is meeting with some success.Greece.31.   250 Germans were killed on the 6th by E.L.A.S. forces in Thessaly.The Germans were caught while they were resting and bathing.The Germans have resumed their drive in the Peloponnese.Burma.A arakan., . 32. Our forces have been moving to their monsoon dispositions. Therehas been only minor local activity on this front.Chin Hills cund Chindwin.33. Our troops have made some progress against determined enemy resistance, south of Bishenpur. In the area of Palel the Japanese made a determined attack on the 10th/11th. On the Imphal-Kohima road enemy blockshave been established at points 12 and 14 miles from Imphal. On the 15th,our troops went over to the offensive and despite heavy rain, which made thegoing difficult, cleared the road blocks 12 miles north of the town.In the area of Kohima fighting in the residential area on the 13th resultedin heavy enemy casualties. To the S.W. of the town our troops have made some further progress against light opposition. An enemy road block in the northernoutskirts of Kohima was cleared in a night, attack on the 14th/15th.New Guinea.34. Australian troops, advancing northwards from Alexishaven, reachedCape Croisilles (15 -miles further north) on the 10th without contacting theenemy.   They have now advanced a further six miles.AIR SITUATION.General Review.35. Heavy attacks were made by home-based aircraft on synthetic oil plants and other targets in Germany and on communications, airfields andMilitary Objectives in France and the Low Countries.In Italy, a record number of sorties was flown; offensive operations were primarily directed against enemy communications.[27485] B. 2

Two ineffective attacks were made on this country at night when atotal of approximately 160 enemy aircraft were reported over the South Coast.The area affected was wide in the extreme, but there are indications that the targets intended may have been Bristol and Portsmouth. Twenty enemy aircraft were shot down including one by A.A. guns and one by an intruder over Prance.Home Waters.37. Beaufighters of Coastal Command, escorted by Mustangs, attacked aneastbound convoy off the Dutch Coast; two ships of 3,000 tons were torpedoed and set on fire, and an escort vessel was damaged.   One Beaufighter is missing.A Spitfire attacked a 1,000-ton ship off Flushing and set her on fire,Typhoons damaged a 1,500-ton ship off St. Malo and an Avenger damaged a1,200-ton ship off Barfieur.Bomber Command aircraft, of which 121 were despatched, laid 365 sea-mines in enemy waters; three Lancasters and one Mosquito are missing.Western Front.38. Although offensive operations were considerably restricted by unfavour-able iveather, Bomber Command aircraft flew 1,302 sorties by night, while air-craft of the Eighth U.S. Air Force and of the Allied Expeditionary Air Forceflew 13,972 sorties by day. Enemy losses in combat were 271 destroyed,35 probably destroyed and 49 damaged and a further 57 were destroyed on theground.   One hundred and fourteen Allied bombers and 55 fighters are missing.The results of some of the attacks referred to below are given inAppendix VII.Germany and Czechoslovakia.39.

During the week ended the 16th May, Allied aircraft of the M.A.A.Fflew a record total of 16,006 sorties; 101 aircraft were lost and 110 enemy aircraft were destroyed.The entire effort of the Allied air forces was directed against the enemy inconformity with the operations on land which commenced on the riiffht ofthe Ilth/I2th. - the main attack was against enemy communications. Opposition was on a relatively small scale and targets were accordingly systematically bombed fromthe battle area to the northern borders of Italy.Road and railway bridges were freely attacked by formations of medium bombers and by fighter bombers with the result that at least 34 bridges were hit,14 probably hit and in 16 instances the approaches were seriously damaged.Harassing attacks, particularly by large numbers of fighter bombers, were extended against railway tracks and roads which were cut repeatedly; road and railway movement was attacked on numerous occasions and a substantial total ofM/T vehicles, railroad wagons and locomotives was destroyed or damaged.In the battle area, command posts, gun and mortar positions and other targets were successfully attacked in close co-operation with the army; further to the rear, enemy H.Q&apos;s were bombed and hit. Fighters patrolled the area and success-fully intercepted some enemy formations and shot down over 30 enemy aircraft.A total of 3,494 sorties was flown by fighter bombers.The Allied night effort was on a comparatively small scale, but light bombers attacked M/T, roads and rolling stock in the Rome area and central Italy.Wellingtons concentrated in the main against enemy ports on the west coast and made good attacks on Piombino, Porto San Stefano, Porto Ferraio (Elba) andGenoa. These attacks were considerably augmented in daylight by raids carriedout by medium and heavy bombers and serious damage was caused to warehouses,quays and railway facilities. At Genoa one inactive liner was set on fire; atPorto Ferraio hits were obtained on four ships (one of 240 feet), on three smallvessels, which were sunk, and on the Iron and Steel works; and at Porto SanStefano three E-boats were probably hit!Heavy bombers concentrated their attacks on railway centres in the north ofItaly, although unfavourable weather somewhat restricted their operations. Inthe main the bombing was well concentrated and serious damage was caused inthe goods yards, to railroad tracks and to the choke points. The principal targetsattacked were: Bolzano (163 tons), Trento (177 tons), Spezia (211 tons),Fidenza (160 tons), Piacenza (158 tons), Modena (117 tons), Vicenza (210 tons),Ferrara (223 tons), Padua (146 tons) and Treviso (100 tons).

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Berlin-Preliminary reports show the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 7th May tohave been the most effective daylight attack to date. More bombs fell in thecentral zones than on any previous occasion and, apart from further damage in theUnter-Den-Linden district, areas to the east and north-east thereof which had escaped comparatively lightly have now received heavy damage. The neighbour-hood of the Alexander Platz was particularly affected and further bombs fell inthis district in the attack on the 8th May. Tram traffic in the central zones was brought to a complete standstill, and the main State railway through the centre ofthe city was cut for a time. In the zones affected, tram traffic was still interruptedon the 10th May. The population who have thought that, with the shorteningnights, heavy attacks would cease are now reported to be showing once again signsof nervousness.Bohlen. Damage resulting from the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the Braunkohle-Lenzin AG. (synthetic oil plant) on the 12th May is mainly centred in the gasgenerating plant and refinery, which are seen, on photographs taken after the attack, to be emitting clouds of black oil smoke. Several other important buildings have also been damaged, including the briquetting plant, the liquid air plant, thelow temperature carbonisation plant and several unidentified buildings.In the power plant and gas works (both of A.G. Sachsische Werke) there isfurther damage to the boiler house, a condensing tower, and several other buildings.Kassel. Further photographs, taken on the 9th May, show that as a resultof the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 19th April, the main Fieseler aircraft assemblyplant at Waldau (assembling F.W. 190) was very severely damaged. Two of thethree large multi-bay shops were partially destroyed, while the third was alsoaffected, though less severely. In addition, four small workshops were demolished and two others and the offices severely damaged.Damage was also caused to the Henschel Flugmotorenbau factory atAltenbauna (manufacture of D.B. 605 engines) where four of the six largeworkshops were damaged and a smaller shop partially destroyed.Kanz Karthaus marshalling yard.- Photographs show that, as a result ofthe U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 11th May, the main weight of the attack has fallenon the railway wagon repair shops and locomotive depot at the south-eastern endof the yard. A large 15-bay workshop has been almost entirely destroyed, and several smaller buildings damaged. Part of a large locomotive depot has been demolished and there is damage to other buildings to the south-west.Merseburg. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the12th May, show a dense pall of smoke covering the central portion of the LuenaWorks. Many buildings, including the gas washing and circulation plant, a group of methanol or isobutal synthesis buildings, and some ammonia liquor and storage tanks, are seen to be burning; other buildings destroyed or damagedinclude the hydrogen contact oven houses, the gas works, the main offices and several unidentified buildings. In addition, the railway installations at the northend of the works are very severely damaged.Sorau. Photographs, taken about four weeks after/the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 11th April, show that 13 out of the 15 small factories in the town which are believed to be manufacturing components for the Focke-Wulf assembly factory,situated about one mile north of the town, have been destroyed or severely damaged. There is considerable scattered business and residential damage, whichis more concentrated in the centre of the old town.Stuttgart.-. A source who has personal knowledge of the activities of theDaimler-Benz group states that no raid on Stuttgart did so much damage fromthe industrial standpoint as that on the night of the lst-2nd March.
