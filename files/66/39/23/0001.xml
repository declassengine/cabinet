THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943./Copy No.WAR CABINET.SUMMARY    OF    OPERATIONS    OF    BOMBER    COMMAND    for fortnight ENDING 1200 HOURS, SUNDAY, 4th JULY, 1943.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE offensive on the Ruhr-Rhinelancl industrial area was continued by large-scale attacks on Krefeld, Miilheim, Elberfeld, Gelsenkirchen and Cologne.Lancasters attacked Friedrichshafen and Spezia in a shuttle raid, using bases in North Africa. The scale of effort during the first week in the period, when7,314 tons of bombs were dropped, is without parallel up to date. June was a record month both in sorties and bomb tonnage; 6,000 sorties were flown and14,224 tons of bombs were dropped on Germany.Night Operations.aircraft target.

In addition 82 aircraft were despatched on anti-submarine patrol and 827 mines were laid by Bomber Command aircraft.Operational Achievements.Krefeld (21st/22nd June).Krefeld had not previously suffered heavy damage and therefore had acquiredadditional importance as an intact area from which assistance to dusseldorf andthe Ruhr could be drawn. Weather conditions were favourable Lor the attack,though the target, which was at first clearly seen, was later obscured by smoke from bombing and fires.Night plots confirmed crews&apos; reports that a most successful attack had been delivered., Day photographs show that well over half the town has been destroyed.Considerable damage has been done to industry and business and residential property has suffered very badly.Miilheim (22nd/23rd June).   &apos;On the 22nd/23rd June 464 aircraft were sent to Mulheim. Although this important satellite of Duisburg had previously suffered considerable incidentaldamage, it had not previously received a full-scale attack. As it was unlikelythat the entire weight of bombs would be concentrated on a target of this size, the approach was so planned that the spread should be in the northerly direction and[25778] . bSECRETW.P.

fall on the adjacent Oberhausen. A certain amount of thin cloud over the targetprevented night photographs from being successful and day cover has not yet beenobtained. Crews&apos; reports, however, indicate that a good concentration of bombingwas achieved. German reports admit severe damage in Mulheim and state thatOberhausen was also hit.Fiberfeld (24th/25th June).Crews&apos; reports, which are confirmed by night plots, make it evident thatthe attack on Elberf eld was highly successful. It is hoped that this raid, togetherwith the recent one on Barmen, will have reduced the industrial output ofWuppertal to negligible proportions.Gelsenkirchen (25th/26th June).There is at present no definite evidence of the results obtained in this attack.Friedrichshafen (20th/21st June).The aim of this attack, which was carried out in bright moonlight by60 Lancasters, was not merely to do important industrial damage, especially tothe production of R.D.F. equipment, but also to show cities in South germany that they are not immune from air attack during the summer months and thus toprevent the withdrawal of defences during that period.Day photographs show 3 acres of devastation in the Zeppelin works. TheZeppelin hangar and the Z.F. gear works received direct hits causing fires. Manyradio-location stores near the hangar were wrecked by H.E., and it is estimatedthat almost half the radio factory&apos;s equipment wras destroyed. Print No. 1 showssome of the damage.The Maybach Motorenbau Works were also hit. A bomb exploded in thecentre of an anti-aircraft battery, killing most of its personnel.All our aircraft proceeded safely to North Africa.Spezia (23rd/24th June).On the way back to this country, the Lancasters attacked Spezia. In spiteof an effective smoke screen,, further damage was done to port and harbourinstallations.Cologne (28th/29th June, 3rd/4th July).Cloud was found over the target to a height of 7,000-10,000 feet, and preliminary reports suggested that the attack on the 28th/29th June was at firstrather scattered and became concentrated only in the later stages, when smoke from large fires and several heavy explosions were heard. Weather conditionsover the target were much more favourable on the 3rd/4th July, and a well-concentrated attack was delivered.Photographs taken on the 4th July show twro main areas of concentrateddamage. On the West bank of the river it is provisionally estimated that at least,000 acres of the centre of the town have been 75 per cent, devastated. On theEast bank very heavy damage is visible throughout the districts of Kalk, Deutz,Buchheim and S. Mulheim with other damage in Poll, Bayenthal, Siilz andEhrenfeld. Damage to the Humboldt-Deutz factories at Kalk and Deutz is very severe. Large sheds at the railway sidings have been destroyed and the Kalkchemical factory badly damaged. The West Deutsche Waggonfabrik, theVereinigte Stahlwerke Vander Zyhhen, the Citroen Werk at Poll and theMannesmann Rohren u Eisenhandel at Westhafen have all been more or less severely damaged. On the West bank there is also very severe damage at theGereon railway yard and at the main station. The North transept of theCathedral was also hit.Results of Previous Raids.Oberhausen.Day photographs show very heavy damage caused by the attack on the14th/15th June. The centre and northern parts of the town suffered heavily,many public buildings and small industrial undertakings being destroyed, inaddition to substantial damage to houses. The most important items of industrialdamage are in the Gutehoffnungshiitte Iron and Steel Works. The VereinigteStahlwerke A.G. Steelworks at Mulheim were also hit during the attack.
Barmen (Wuppertal).Day photographs show that the destruction produced by the attack on the29th/30th May was practically complete. Upwards of 1,000 acres of devastationare visible, including a large number of small factories and public buildings.The important chemical works of J. P. Bemberg A.G. are severely damaged.Railway communications and public utilities have naturally been very heavilyhit.   Prints Nos. 2 and 3 show some of the damage caused in Barmen.Dortmund.Damage to Dortmund additional to that previously reported is shown byphotographs taken on the 20th June. Three more branches of Hoesch A.G., the synthetic Oil Plant, the No. 2 Kaiserstuhl Colliery and the Cement Works havebeen hit. There is also damage previously undisclosed in the Hoesch A.G.Steelworks; other collieries, engineering works and brickworks have suffered heavily.The total damage done to Hoesch A.G. is estimated to be as serious a matter for German war production as that previously done to Krupps at Essen. Thedestruction at the latter has probably freed part of the Borbeck and Rheinhausensteel output for other users. The damage to Hoesch (which had itself a steelcapacity of 1,500,000 tons per annum) means that steel making and fabricatingcapacity have both gone. On a conservative estimate the entire steel industry ofDortmund and the heavy engineering and armament industries allied to it willhave been stopped for at least two weeks, and it may well be that Hoesch, the biggest of them, will lose the equivalent of six months&apos; full output. In terms ofsteel ingots, this would, mean about 750,000 tons.Essen.It is reported that undamaged machinery from Krupps has been sent toLuxemburg and Mulhouse and that 3,500 workers have been moved to Alsace.Shortage of housing at Essen, where 100,000 workers are reported still to haveno roof over their heads, is said to make the resumption of full-scale activity atKrupps impracticable.Bochum..130 acres of business and residential property in the central city zone weredevastated by the attack oil the 12th/13th June. 700 buildings in this area were destroyed or damaged. The most important item of industrial damage is Eisenund Huttenwerke A.G. (sheet metal and steel works) where 10 buildings havebeen affected. Barracks, station buildings and railway goods sheds have been gutted and, a large tram depot has been destroyed.Le Creusot.More than 30 large and medium buildings are shown to have been damaged by the attack on the 19th/20th June. In the processing works, the rolling mills,heavy forging and armour plate bending shop; locomotive erecting shop and loco-motive machine shop have all been badly hit. The Breuil and Le Creusot steel-works have also been badly damaged. Fires were still burning on the day afterthe attack.Mining Results.The following mining success is reported : On the 29th June a minesweeper was seriously damaged by a mine offthe mouth of the Gironde.A.
