THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,   July 1943.The circulation of this paper has bee^ strictly limited.   It is issued for the personal use of.......MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 303.Hth July, 1943.WAR CABINET.BUILDING LABOUR AND THE MAN-POWER REVIEW.Note by the Minister of Production.THE man-power calculations in the Minister of Labour&apos;s review L.P. (43)115 and in the paper by the Lord President of the Council, W.P. (43) 271, assume that withdrawals from the building industry for the Forces or for employmentin munitions will be continued for the rest of 1943, in accordance with the WarCabinet decisions of last December.2. The United States authorities are pressing me for the necessary labour to complete various projects which are needed for the accommodation of UnitedStates aircraft, stores, air force and ground force personnel, &amp;c. I am nowinformed by them that either they cannot provide suitable constructional troopsthemselves, or they cannot get them here in time to complete the work by the duedates. They state very strongly that, unless we can find the labour, the militaryplans decided upon at the Washington Conference cannot be fulfilled. The exactamount of labour involved is now being examined and I can give no figures; butas a preliminary and tentative estimate I can say that it would appear necessaryto maintain the labour force now employed on the Government building pro-gramme until the end of December, if the essential works are to be carried out intime.3. For the reasons given in paragraph 10 of W.P. (43) 271, it is not suggested that this possibility should &quot;be allowed to affect the broad decisions which now have to be taken on man-power allocations. I raise the matter now only as a warning that it may be necessary to ask very shortly for a decision onthis further issue.O. L.Ministry of Production, S.W. 1,8th July, 1943.[25713]
