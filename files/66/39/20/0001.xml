PART I. ALLIED NAVAL CONTINGENTS.French Navy.THE agreement so far reached between Generals de Gaulle and Giraud hasnot yet led to any rearrangement in the administration of the respective naval forces, which continue to function as before. It is not without significance that although the Free French had pressed the Admiralty to station all theirsubmarines and their two large destroyers in the Mediterranean, they have nowreversed their policy and want these ships kept out of the Mediterranean for thepresent.2. A French Chief of Staffs Committee has been formed, in Algiersrepresenting both factions and it is understood that its first duty is to study how the forces can be unified.3. Since the landing in North Africa the following ships have come under-Allied control 3 Battleships. 1 Aircraft Carrier, 3 8-inch Cruisers, 6 6-inch cruisers, 10 Destroyers, 15 Submarines and a Depot Ship, 36 Sloops, Mine-sweepers, Escort Vessels, &amp;c. These numbers include the ships of Force &quot; X &quot;which have been immobilised at Alexandria since the fall of France. The main body are now proceeding, via the Cape to West Africa.Changes in the Free French Fleet.4.   No additional ships have been commissioned during the last quarter.5.   The destroyer Leopard went ashore in the Mediterranean and is a total loss.6. Consideration is being given to the allocation of further ships to bemanned by the crew of Leopard and other newly-joined recruits.7.   The keenness and efficiency of the Free French personnel remain as before.Frenchmen in the Royal Navy.8. There is still no indication of any of these, officers and men wishing tojoin the North African French Forces, but this may alter when the situation isclearer.9. The legislation by which these men may acquire British nationality hasnow been passed and will be promulgated very shortly.Polish Navy.10. There was at one time a possibility that the Poles would abandon the manning of the cruiser Dragon, as their intention to re-name her Lwow wasnot acceptable to the British Government on account of the Russian-Polishfrontier dispute. The matter was settled by the Poles deciding to leave her nameunchanged. It was not, however, without a lot of consideration that this solutionwas reached, and the incident typifies the feeling which exists amongst thePoles due not only to frontier questions, but to the treatment accorded bv russia to their helpless dependants..11. The men maintain their keenness and smartness and the ships are aa,efficient as ever.Successes.12.   The submarine Dzik, operating in the Mediterranean, sank a 7,000-tonenemy Tanker and also a 4,000-ton Supply Ship.Ships Commissioned.13-&apos;   M.G.B. 113 has been taken over at Dover in place of an older boat, S. 3.Recruiting. - .      1   1 -14. The effort to secure an additionaE 300 recruits from the Middle Easthas failed arid the,number is to be made up from various other sources over thenext six months.   So far 70 have been recruited.[25729]
Ships to be Commissioned.   .15.   The refit of Dragon has been extended until the end of July,, when thePolish crew will be ready to take her to sea for trials and working up.Royal Netherlands Navy.16.   Morale and efficiency have been maintained at the previous high level.Ships Commissioned.17. The Frigate Ribble was taken over and commissioned as the JohanM aurits.18. Six more Motor Minesweepers have been commissioned and the Dutchwill shortly have seventeen Minesweepers operating in the Harwich area.- 19.   One Minesweeper was taken over from the Royal Australian Navy.Ships to be Commissioned.20. The submarine Talent, now building, has been allocated and has beenrenamed Zwaardvisch.21. Another new submarine has been asked for to replace 0. 14, which isnot considered to be worth the extensive refit she requires.Ships lent to the Royal Navy.22.

Two M.T.Bs. made a successful attack off the Norwegian coast and sank a large German motor vessel and damaged her escort.Losses.25. The destroyer Eskdale was sunk by torpedo from a German E-boatin the Channel.   There were 25 killed and missing.Shijis Commissioned.26.   One ML and M.T.B.Ships to be Commissioned.27. The Admiralty have been asked to allocate another destroyer to replaceEskdale, but no decision has yet been taken.Royal Navy (Section Beige).28. The improvement in recruiting has been maintained. It is hoped toman further vessels shortly, possibly Motor Minesweepers, but when dealing insuch small numbers there are inevitably shortages in some categories which mustbe made up before further commitments can be undertaken.Royal Hellenic Navy.29. Training of Greek personnel has continued satisfactorily. It has notyet been found possible to allocate another &quot; Hunt &quot; Class destroyer or any more&quot; Flower &quot; Class corvettes which the Greeks would like. It has, however, beenarranged for them to take over some Landing Craft and Minesweepers. Althoughthe Greeks were quite naturally disappointed, they have accepted the situationin a good spirit.Successes.30. The destroyer Queen Olga, in company with a British destroyer, wasin action off the south of Italy against a number of escorted enemy supply ships.Two or three of these were sunk.
31. The submarine Katsonis torpedoed and shelled a 1,200-ton SpanishMerchantman in the iEgean and drove her ashore. She also claims a probablehit on a 7,000-ton Transport at Samos.Ships Commissioned or to be Commissioned Shortly.32. Crews for three L.S.Ts. are now in the United States. Four MotorMinesweepers (B.Y.M.S.) have been taken over in this country. All these areto proceed to the Mediterranean. It may be found possible to man one or two more of these types of craft and also some Fleet Tenders in the Mediterranean.33. The submarine chaser presented to the King of Greece&apos; by president roosevelt has been commissioned as King George II.34. Two Tugs in the Suez Canal, formerly manned by Free French crews,have been taken over.35. The repairs to the Themistocles have been completed and she is now about to start trials.Royal Yugoslav Navy.36. About 100 Yugoslav officers and men arrived in this country from theMiddle East. They are now at Portsmouth being trained to man a &quot; Flower &quot;Class corvette. Their morale and discipline are on the whole satisfactory. Itmay also be found possible to man one or two M.T.Bs.Danish Contingent in Royal Navy.37. Approval has been given for the recruitment of about 100 Danes witha view to their manning, in the first instance, two Motor Minesweepers. The firstparty of about 30 men of various categories will commence their training inH.M.S. Royal Arthur during July.38. Two officers of the Royal Danish Navy have been granted commissionsas Lieutenants R.N.R.PART II. ALLIED ARMY CONTINGENTS.General Remarks by the Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.39. The general standard of training of the Allied Contingents has considerably improved during the last few months. On the completion of there organisation of the Norwegian, Netherlands and Belgian Contingents, theCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces, arranged that these should be moved fromtheir depots and attached to British formations for training. Allied units havebeen placed in close contact with British units. They train together, officers andother ranks intermingle and get to know one another, and the Allies attend Britishdemonstrations of all natures and exchange ideas. As a result the standard tobe aimed at has been raised and the contact between the British and Allied troopsis much closer as a .result of the Commander-in-Chief &apos;s arrangements. There isno doubt the Allied Contingents greatly benefit by a frequent change of sceneand environment, and a prolonged stay in one area not unnaturally produces ameasure of stagnation.40. The Polish Corps consists of one Armoured Division, the GrenadierDivision in cadre form, a parachute brigade and static and training organisa-tions. Shortage of personnel is the main difficulty. The Armoured Division isnow training in the Newmarket area, the remainder of the formations are inScotland. This Division is organised as an old model Armoured Division andis at present equipped with Crusader Mark VI tanks. The Infantry and certain administrative units are below establishment. No reserves to replace casulties are available. The issue of Sherman tanks to replace Crusaders would increasethe personnel difficulty. No further reinforcements are expected to arrive fromthe Middle East. The Polish General Staff hope that a considerable number of reinforcements for the Corps will be provided by volunteers from the PolishNationals who have been serving in the German Army and have become prisoners in North Africa. There are no indications at present that important numberswill be forthcoming from this source. Although the Poles are extreme optimistsby nature, there is a growing feeling amongst their officers of all ranks that thingscannot remain as they are and that it will be necessary to reorganise their
Armoured Division if it is to be in a position to fight on the continent, to conform10 that of the British new model Division. The available personnel are sufficientto produce such a Division at war strength with a very small reserve. They haveclung to the old model organisation as they wish to have available two ArmouredBrigades on their return to Poland, and on account of their domestic difficultyin reducing one established Armoured Brigade to cadre and the possible discon-tent that this would produce. It seems probable that a decision on this question will be made before very long. The Polish Armoured Division is now fully equipped in all essentials, and there is no doubt that all ranks will greatly benefit by two months&apos; training with British Armoured formations, as until recently,owing&apos;.to lack of equipment, little more than unit training has been possible in.Scotland.41. The Czechoslovak Brigade is in process of conversion to an armoured brigade with supporting&apos; arms. Some tanks have been delivered and officers andmen are attending courses at British Armoured schools. It is to be expectedthat the progress in training and conversion will be rapid. All ranks are verypleased with the decision to reorganise the Brigade on an Armoured basis andare keen and enthusiastic to make good in their new role.42. The French are in process of raising two Parachute Battalions in thiscountry to be employed under the Allied Commander-in-Chief for operations inFrance. The Battalions will also be trained as Infantry and will be regardedas infantry and potential paratroops. The organisation of the first Battalionis not yet complete.43. The Allied Parachute Units train in close contact with 6 AirborneDivision. Shortage of aircraft at present limits operational training, but allunits carry out refresher courses at the British training establishments and are attached to 6 Airborne Division whenever possible. The Polish Airborne Brigadeis now about 2,500 strong, the parachute units of the other Allies being one company in each case.44. The scheme for attaching surplus Allied officers of suitable age and experience to the British Army is about to be introduced, and a War Office board will commence interviewing candidates early in July. Officers selected will beattached to British Units for three months. This will be regarded as an experimental and probationary period before a further scheme for more prolongedattachment or transfer is introduced. Some&apos; 50 young Norwegian officers are attached to 52 Division permanently as Liaison Officers. The majority of these have cone very well, and, where there is a shortage of British officers, Norwegianofficers command British companies and platoons. It is reported that the Britishtroops are quite contented to be commanded by a Norwegian officer provided heis a good leader and has the confidence of the men.45. Valuable reinforcements continue to arrive from North Africa and elsewhere for some of the Contingents.46. The Allied Defence Ministers continue their planning, for the expansion,organisation of their armies and the defence problems that will arise on thereoccupation of their countries.47. The morale of all the Contingents remains high and all ranks displaygreat keenness on training. There have been no political difficulties Recently ofany account. The general behaviour of the troops and their relations with thecivil population continues to be very good. ,   /French Forces.Establishment and Organisation.48. There are no fixed establishments. The military personnel are dividedinto Services Generaux, a &apos;&apos; Groupe Mixte &apos;&apos; (trained fighting men and recruits)and a Parachute Unit, for which approval has been given for its expansion to2 battalions.  Three companies are formed at present.49.   In addition, there is a troop in No. 10 (Inter-Alliecl) Commando.Strength and Locution. Officers.  Other Ranks.50.   Old Dean Common Camp, Camberley     ...      94 693There are also 32 officers and 341 other ranks Air Force personnel accommo-dated at the camp.
Special Points regarding Training.51. Apart from the parachute troops, the French Contingent is little morethan a depot to which men are posted on arrival in this country, and have in thepast been drafted away shortly after. Some have received little or no pre-liminary training, and the training at the depot is therefore mainly of anelementary nature. The parachute troops are carrying out active training withthe assistance of 6 Airborne Division.52. A considerable number of French trqops have passed through the AlliedSpecial Training Centre, Inverlochy.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.53. Recruits and reinforcements have recently been arriving in increasing-numbers. Some of these, who have escaped from France, have probably done soto avoid compulsory service in Germany, and are not of the best material. Thereare no indications at present of French policy regarding the retention of french troops in this country or their removal to North Africa.Polish Forces.54. Officers.

In addition, there are a number of static establishments located inScotland, including the Polish Staff College and Training Centres for Artillery,Engineers, Signals, Infantry, and A.F.Vs.57. A Polish troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando is located in South-Eastern Command.Command.58. Lieutenant-General Zajac assumed command of the Polish Corps inScotland on the 9th April, 1943.Move of Armoured Division.59. The Armoured Division moved to the Newmarket-Thetford area during June to train with British troops for the next two months, after which the division will return to Scotland.Special Points regarding Training.60. The Polish Field and Medium Artillery recently practised at Redesdaleand Sennybridge. The standard of training shown was well above the averageexcept in Anti-tank shooting, which was below average.- 61. The Armoured Division, have commenced training in the NewmarketArea. Experienced British officers have .been attached as umpires. A series ofexercises have been arranged by Eastern Command, commencing with skeletonSignal and Administrative exercises and culminating in formation exercises with british Armoured Divisions.
Provision of Guards for Prisoners of Wax.62. At the request of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, ScottishCommand, a composite battalion of 40 officers and 700 other ranks from the1st Grenadier Division Cadre guarded over 13,000 German and Italian prisonersof war from the 4th to 11th June.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents:63. There have been no political difficulties in the Polish Corps and the morale of the troops remains high. The move of the Armoured Division to a newarea is very popular with all ranks. There is a growing feeling in the divisionthat, unless the present deficiencies in personnel can be made good, a change in organisation must be made. All ranks are longing to fight the Germans, butrealise that they cannot do so with success in a formation which will be belowstrength at the commencement of active operations.Dutch Forces.64.EstablishmentStrength and Locations.Princess Irene Brigade BerkhamsteadArea   ...Depot  and   Training  Establishment Wrottesley   Park   Camp,   Wolver-hampton   .   ...       ...       ...London Headquarters. &amp;c.Total Strength   .........Organisation.65. The Dutch Contingent (Princess Irene Brigade) is organized asfollows : Brigade Headquarters.Brigade Signal Section.Brigade Reconnaissance Unit.Field Artillery Troop.3 Independent Companies.Independent Parachute Company.Ancillary Services.66. In addition, there is a Depot and Training Establishment located as inparagraph 64 above and a troop in No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.Special Points regarding Training.67. Commencing in May the Contingent was attached to 80 Division forelementary training for six weeks. Individual units trained with British units.Previous to this the Contingent had been located in their aamp at Danes Court,near Wolverhampton, and this attachment was the first continuous training thatthe Dutch have had with British troops. The Dutch took full opportunity of thefacilities for training provided for them. , The Contingent moved on the 18th june to Berkhamstead area for higher training with 61 Division. Individual units are now training with British units. Later, the Contingent will probably be concentrated for collective training with British formations.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.68. There is no doubt the move of the Dutch Contingent from- theircomfortable camp at Wrottesley Park and the training with British troops will produce a marked improvement in the efficiency of all units. The young officersand men are keen, fit and most anxious to make progress. The weakness lies insome of the senior officers who are on the old side and not equal to their responsi-bilities or possess sufficient drive, energy and enthusiasm for training. Theremoval of a senior officer is a difficult matter for the Government of a small&quot;Contingent.69. The Dutch and British troops have a good deal in common and get on very well together.Officers.     Other Ranks.203 1,70960 1,04321 . 641142 206223 1,890

It is organized as follows : Norwegian Army Command.Brigade Headquarters.Infantry Battalion Headquarters.4 Independent Mountain Companies (3 formed).Independent Parachute Company.Field Battery.Signal Training Company.Administrative Services and Schools.73. In addition, the Norwegians have a Company in Iceland and a troopin No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.Special Points regarding Training.74. The Contingent has carried out collective training and exercises withthe 227 Independent Brigade and with 52 Division. In addition, units of the contingent have been attached to formations and units of 52 Division for one month. Good progress has been made during the last few months in the standardof training of the Contingent operating as a whole and of the companies operatingindependently.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.75. The strength of the Contingent has slightly increased. A reserve ofofficers is being built up by promotions from the ranks in this country and byarrivals from Sweden. This reserve is required for the future needs of theNorwegian Army to be organized on the reoccupation of Norway.76. There is no doubt that the Contingent has made good progress duringthe last few months.

79. In addition to the above, the Belgians have a troop in No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando; and a General Duties Company at Wimbledon (Company ofInvalids).Special Points regarding Training.80. No. 1 Group has carried out operational exercises in connection withthe defence of Lowestoft. Exercises with British troops have been held andbattle practices carried out by Artillery and Infantry. Further collectivetraining with British formations has been arranged.81. The Belgian Parachute Company will be attached to 3 ParachuteBrigade from the 31st July to the 31st August.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.82. The strength of the Contingent continues to grow as a result of rein-forcements arriving from Spain, North Africa and elsewhere. An additionalInfantry Platoon has been added to each company, and it is expected that a newEngineer Unit will be formed and possibly an additional battery.83. No. .1 Group is well commanded, making good progress, contented and free from politics.84. No. 2 Group at Leamington continues to contain some officers whoexpend too much thought on politics and not enough energy on their militaryduties.Czechoslovak Forces.85.EstablishmentStrength and Locations.Czechoslovak Brigade- Harwich Area ...Depot and Training Centre-PeterboroughLondon Headquarters, &amp;c. ..Officers.35743146140617Other Ranks.4,5422,338227139Total strength    ...      617 2,704Organisation.86.

(Platoon formed).Ancillary Services.87.. Early this year the Czechoslovak Depot and Training Centre wasseparated from the rest of the Contingent and located at Peterborough.Special Points regarding Training.88. Normal training has been carried out, but no formation exercises havebeen held on account of the conversion to an armoured organisation.89. The Contingent having an operational role for the defence of Harwich,exercises for this purpose have been held.90. Officers and other ranks have been sent on courses at British ArmouredSchools and have been attached to British&apos; Armoured and R.E.M.E. units. Asmall number of Crusader Mark VI tanks have been issued for instructionalpurposes.
Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.91. The reorganisation of the Contingent is now in full swing. The 1,600officers and men from the Middle East are expected to arrive in this country earlyin August.92. The Contingent will remain in the Harwich area and continue to carryout its operational role for the defence of the port until the early autumn whenit will be moved to a more suitable area for armoured training&apos;.PART III. ALLIED AIR CONTINGENTS.General Notes.&quot;Morale.93.   Generally morale in the Allied Air Forces remains remarkably high.Man-power.94. The Polish Air Force has now sufficient personnel .in the UnitedKingdom to maintain for about ten months an adequate and even flow of pupilsinto aircrew training to support its operational units, and also to increase thenumber of ancillary units requiring ground personnel only.95. In contrast, the man-power position of the Czechoslovak Air Force is serious. Their Recruit Depot is practically empty and there seems little chanceof its replenishment.96. So far as the other Allied Air Forces are concerned, it seems not improbable that personnel will (sometimes in a very irregular flow) be just aboutadequate to maintain their present strength for a year. Should the Free and&apos;&apos; Giraud&apos;&apos; French Air Forces agree to pool their resources, they might well find themselves in a relatively strong position.Training.97. Allied aircrew personnel (pilot, navigator -and air bomber), exceptingNorwegians, Greeks and Yugoslavs, receive their initial training in the UnitedKingdom.   Polish pilots receive their full training also in this country.98. Allied (P.N.B.) aircrew, except again Greeks and Yugoslavs, are given their basic training in Canada,, the Norwegians being responsible for the trainingof their own nationals in the earlier stages.99. Greek and Yugoslav training is carried out in Southern Rhodesia(aircraw only) and in the Union of South Africa (mainly wireless, gunnery,,general reconnaissance and aircraft maintenance).100. Technical, wireless and&apos; gunnery training of other nationals is almostentirely given in the United Kingdom. 4101. Operational training is given as circumstances dictate either in theUnited Kingdom, Canada, the Bahamas or the Middle East.102. Space in schools has already been earmarked so that full advantage maybe taken of Allied personnel likely to be available for training. .   .103.   In general the training of Allies is proceeding satisfactorily.Free French Air Force.Operations. &apos;104. In Fighter Command aircraft of Nos. 340 and 341 Squadrons operatedfor 179 and 1,052 hours respectively and.destroyed 6 and damaged 1 enemy aircraft. The Commanding Officer of No. 341 Squadron, operating fromBiggin Hill, was credited with one-half of the thousandth enemy aircraft shot down by the sector.105. In the Tactical Air Force of Fighter Command No. 342 Light Bomber-Squadron, which became operational on the 10th June, 1943, has carried ouc3 operational sorties. During the earlier part of the period under review this squadron was non-operational while being re-equipped with Boston and Havocaircraft. It was transferred from Bomber to Fighter Command on the1st June, 1943.* For Battle Order, see Appendix II.[25729] - c 2
Overseas Units (outside R.A.F. Target Force).106. Bretagne Squadron. General Vuillemin has been appointed by-General de Gaulle to command this squadron, which was part of General Leclerc&apos;sforce which trekked from the Chad. The squadron has at present only a fewaircraft fit for service, but has attracted to itself about 500 deserters fromGeneral Giraud&apos;s forces.107. Groupe d&apos;Artois. This squadron has now eight Anson aircraft, 4 atDuata and 4 at Pointe Noire, for convoy duty under R.A.F. Air Headquarters,West Africa.108. Normandie Squadron. This squadron is operating with the russian air Force on Yak aircraft. The flying personnel for the squadron were sent toRussia in the summer of 1942 (see paragraph 225 of the Twenty-Second Report),and during the quarter some Free French replacement pilots have been sent toRussia from the United Kingdom.Communication A ire-raft.109. The Free French have now 5 Lockheed Lodestar aircraft for generalcommunication work in Africa, and it is expected that they will have 4 Dominieaircraft shortly for use in Madagascar.Morale.110. Morale of the Fighter Squadrons of Fighter Command has beenexcellent; that of No. 342, which was- poor, has recently improved. Two senior officers and some maintenance personnel have had to be removed from the squadronfor want of discipline and spirit.General.111. General Valin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Free French Air Force,is leaving shortly for North-Africa to take part in discussions which it is hopedwill lead to a fusion of the Air Forces of Generals de Gaulle and Giraud.&quot; Giraud &quot; French Air Forces.A eronautique Maritime.112. The initial crews to form two (Naval Air Arm) Squadrons as part ofthe R.A.F. Target Force in West Africa (see paragraph 125 of the Twenty-fouth report) have now completed operational training and will shortly ferry their aircraft from this country.Morale.113. Of the 46 officers and 180 airmen of French Naval Air Arm sent tothe United Kingdom for operational training the - Wellington crews, mainlydrawn from North Africa, are excellent, but the spirit of the Sunderland crewsdrawn from Dakar was not at first so good, but has markedly improved since theystarted training for the task of ferrying their aircraft to West Africa. It hasbeen necessary as far as possible to keep these officers and airmen segregatedfrom personnel of the Free French Air Force, which has complicated administra-tion. However, difficulties have been overcome and only two have deserted toGeneral de Gaulle.Armee de VAir.114. Active consideration is being given to ways and means whereby there organisation of the French Air Force now in North Africa can be effected.Already, Air Chief Marshal Tedder has re-equipped 3 Armee de 1&apos;Air Squadronswith Spitfires and the Americans another with war hawks. A proposal has beenput forward that French North African personnel should man two of the heavy bomber Squadrons of Bomber Command&apos;s planned expansion.General.115. General Bouscat has been appointed General Giraud&apos;s Chief, of AirStaff, but General de Gaulle has not yet appointed his own.       (.
Polish Air Force.Operations.116. In Bomber Command Polish Squadrons made 306 sorties during the quarter. Their objectives included Duisburg (on four occasions), St. Nazaire(twice), Bochum (twice), Lorient, Kiel, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Mannheim,Dortmund (twice), dusseldorf (twice), Essen and Wupperthal. In fifteenoperations 140 mines were laid in enemy waters.117. No. 300 Squadron in May carried out more successful sorties than anyother Wellington Squadron in No. 1 Group. Several photographs of the point ofaim were obtained by Polish crews. During the last two-months of the quarterthere was a marked decrease in the number of cancellations before &apos;&apos; take-off&apos;&apos;and of &quot;early returns.&quot; Bomber Command report that at the moment this squadron, which has an excelllent operational record, compares most favourably with the British Squadrons in the Group.118. The Polish Flight in No. 138 Squadron (Bomber Command) (whichhas a special role) has only recently been established, although a few Polishaircrews have been operating with the Squadron for over a year. During the last quarter the short nights have precluded very long distance flights, as, forexample, over Poland, but Polish aircrews have taken part in shorter missions.119. In Fighter Command Polish fighter Squadrons operated for 4,554hours, and destroyed 4 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 5 and damaged 15.No. 309 Fighter Reconnaissance Squadron, which was transferred to thisCommand on the 1st June, has carried out a number of convoy escort patrols.In April and May it was largely occupied with internal reorganisation,following the surrender of personnel to form the nucleus of No. 318 Squadron.120. In Coastal Command No. 304 Squadron made 41 sorties, during which two enemy submarines were attacked.121, In Middle East Command the Flight of Spitfire aircraft in No. 145Squadron, manned by a specially selected team of experienced Polish pilots,referred to in paragraph 137 of the Twenty-Fourth Report, became operationalon the 17th March, and by the 7th May had made 454 sorties (representing 404flying hours). With the loss of only one pilot and one aircraft lost and one aircraftdamaged, the Flight destroyed 25 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 3 and damaged 7. It was mainly employed to provide top cover, a task in which itexcelled. On one occasion, when other Spitfire Squadrons destroyed a completeformation of 20 M.E. 323 Transports, this Polish Flight, detailed to protect ourattacking formation, accounted for 5 M.E. 109 and 1 M.C. 202 aircraft.122. So experienced were these Polish pilots found to be that the air officer Commanding, Western Desert, regarded them as wasted in the restrictedrole set for them. To some he offered command of R.A.F. Squadrons or Flights,and three pilots have accepted his offer. The remainder of the Flight, its taskcompleted, is returning to the United Kingdom.123. In Balloon Command the Polish Flight in No. 929 Squadron has remained responsible for sites in the North Queensferry, Inverkeithing andDonibristle areas. Some training has also been carried out in the operation ofwaterborne balloons.Re-equipment.124. Early in April No. 300 Squadron was raised to full strength andre-equipped with Wellington X aircraft, and No. 305 Squadron was reduced to an aircraft establishment of 8 4- 1, receiving also Wellington X.Fighter Reconnaissance Squadron for Middle East Command.125. No. 318 Squadron (see paragraph 1.36 of the Twenty-Fourth Report)has nearly completed its operational training and is expected to leave in Augustfor service with the Polish Land Forces in the Middle East.Changes in Operational Role.126. It has been agreed in principle that the seven Polish day fighter squadrons, No. 309 Fighter Reconnaissance Squadron, and No. 305 BomberSquadron (when it can be reformed at full strength on new aircraft probablyMitchell B. 25) shall be transferred to the Tactical Air Force of Fighter Command.
127. No. 304 Squadron, now definitely transferred to Coastal Command, was engaged during the earlier part of the period under review on anti-shippingstrikes (torpedo).  It has now reverted to its previous role (anti-submarine patrol).Morale.128. Bomber Command report that morale has been generally good, andthis good morale, coupled with a competitive spirit, has been most marked inNo. 300 Squadron since it was brought up to full strength with the same aircraft establishment as the R.A.F. Wellington Squadrons.129. Coastal Command report that No. 304 Squadron is very keen andthirsty for operational employment, and expect it to be &quot; a big asset in the BayOffensive.&apos;&apos;130. In Fighter Command morale of Polish Squadrons has been very goodthroughout.   Polish morale in Balloon Command has been very satisfactory.131. The very high morale maintained in the flight which was operating inthe Middle East can be gauged from paragraph 121 above.Recruiting.132. All the Polish Army personnel,, approximately 2,000, selected in theMiddle East for the Polish Air Force have now reached the United Kingdom (seeparagraph 144 of the Twenty-Fourth Report).New Formations. \133. The Establishment of 3 ancillary units has been sanctioned, two repair and Salvage Sections and a Mobile Equipment Park. The formation of certainStation Signal Sections has been approved in principle, and these and furtherancillary units necessary to make the Polish Air Force reasonably self-sufficientwill be formed as and when the personnel, technical and non-technical, areavailable.Experiment and Research.134. Posts for Polish Technical specialists employed under the control ofthe Ministry of Aircraft Production on experimental and research duties inR.A.F. Units have been established which will enable them to be given rankappropriate to their responsibilities.Polish Women Auxiliaries.135. A proposal is under consideration to employ 2,000 Polish women asauxiliaries to the Polish Air Force. It is not yet clear whether, if the scheme is approved, these will be organised within the framework of the W.A.A.F. or asa separate Polish Service.136. In the meantime 37 Polish airwomen have been enrolled in theW.A.A.F. for training in administration.Scheme for Training Polish Aircraft Apprentices.137. Detailed plans for the reception and training of approximately 300 boysare being prepared, and a cadre of Polish instructors will shortly proceed intoInstructor Schools. The boys are at present being selected from the large numbernow in the Middle East, and some are already receiving preliminary instruction.They are expected to reach the United. Kingdom in the autumn and to start their3 years&apos; training in January, 1944.Staff Appointments.138. A number of posts have been established in the Air Ministry and ministry of Aircraft production for Polish Officers, who will study British staffmethods and organisation.139. A Polish Group Captain has been posted to Headquarters, transport command, for liaison duties.140. A delegate of the Polish Inspector-General has been added to the headquarters of the United Kingdom Air Liaison Mission in Canada.
Policy.141. The draft of a new Anglo-Polish Agreement, approved.by the polish authorities, is being considered by the Foreign Office and the Allied Forces(Official) Committee.Royal Dutch Naval Air Service.Operations and Morale.142. No. 321 Squadron has been serving ih No. 222 Group (Indian Ocean),mainly on long-range reconnaissance. One flight has been operating temporarilyfrom South African bases on anti-submarine &quot;patrol.143. No. 320 Squadron has been non-operational while undergoingconversion to Mitchell II (B. 25) aircraft, in the delivery of which there has been some delay.  Morale remains high.Royal Dutch Army Aviation (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations.144. The Dutch element (10 pilots) in No. 167 (RAP. Day Fighter)Squadron carried out 592 flying hours on operations destroying 1 enemy aircraft,probably destroying 2 and damaging 4.New Formations.145. On the 12th June No. 322 Dutch Day Fighter Squadron was formed(absorbing the Dutch element in No. 167 Squadron), and this squadron has alreadybeen engaged.Morale.146.   Morale remains high.Recruiting.147. Both the . Dutch Naval and Army Air Services continue to receivereinforcement, though this is spasmodic, from overseas resources and from theDutch Army and Navy. From Holland itself and the continent the flow haspractically ceased owing to the great difficulties attending attempts to escape.Royal Norwegian Air Force.Operations.14.8. In Fighter Command the two day fighter squadrons together carriedout operational flights totalling 2,616 flying hours. They destroyed 38 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 10 and damaged 30. During the past 3 months these squadrons have been among the highest scoring squadrons in Fighter Command.149. In Coastal Command, No. 330 (Sunderland) Squadron made 34 sorties.No. 333 Squadron, which only formed in May on 3 -f 0 Catalina and 4 + 2 Mosquitoaircraft (after absorbing No. 147.7 Flight), made 59 sorties with Catalina and with Mosquito aircraft. The Mosquito flight has destroyed a Dornier 24 and -probably destroyed another. These two Coastal Squadrons have been employedon anti-submarine patrol, convoy protection, shipping reconnaissance off theNorwegian coast and special missions. In the case of No. 333 Squadron, allpatrols were 100 per cent, effective except one, which was1 90 per cent, effective.Morale.150.   Very high throughout.Recruiting.151. The flow of recruits is erratic and depends mainly on Air Transportfrom Sweden, which is inoperative at this time of the year.The Belgian Air Force (R.A.F.Y.R.).General.152. No. 350 Squadron flew operationally for only 62 hours during the quarter, but destroyed an enemy aircraft. Morale has been very good throughout.No. 349 Squadron, which has returned from West Africa (see paragraph 165 of
the Twenty-fourth Report), is now reforming on Spitfire V.A. aircraft. All theaircrews are Belgian, but so far only about 30 per cent, of the maintenancepersonnel are Belgian.Trainees from Belgian Congo.153. No satisfactory arrangement has yet been made with the Belgian CongoAuthorities for the employment of their personnel when trained in schools in theUnion of South Africa (see paragraphs 168 to 170 in the Twenty-fourth Report).Negotiations are proceeding.Czechoslovak Air Force (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations.154. In Fighter Command the 3 day Fighter Squadrons carried out over4,700 flying hours on operations.155. In Coastal &quot;Command No. 311 Squadron made 135 sorties between the21st March and the 20th May. Six enemy submarines were sighted, then attacks were made and one submarine was assessed by the Naval Staff as seriously damaged and possibly destroyed. A convoy was given protection and hits werescored on enemy ships, one being a large merchant vessel.Re-equipment.156. On the 21st May No. 311 Squadron started to convert from Wellingtonto Liberator aircraft.&apos; By the 19th June 23 Captains and 21 crews had beenfully converted to the new type, and after completing 339 flying hours by day and119 by night the Squadron had caused no damage to aircraft.Morale.157. Morale in the Fighter Squadrons has been very good throughout theperiod.-&apos;158. As regards No. 311 Squadron, the R.A.F. Station Commander states :&quot; I have nothing but praise for this Squadron, which is ably led by a zealous,efficient and confident Squadron Commander. The standard of work is of thehighest order : they know what they are fighting for : they have love of countryand a real pride in themselves and in all they do : they show inflexibility of purpose : they are cheerful at all times and have good and unassuming manners.Their morale is in consequence very high.&quot;Provision of replacement aircrews.159. The flow from basic training of Czechoslovak fighter pilots is no longersufficient to make good wastage in the 3 day fighter Squadrons and already R.A.F.pilots equivalent to a flight have been drafted into No. 313 Squadron.160. The supply of trained aircrew personnel to support the CoastalSquadron appears to be reasonably well assured for some months. When the replacement crews now in operational training in this country have completed their courses, the Czechoslovak flight established in No. 6 O.T.U. will.be dis-banded, as further replacement crews will be trained in No. Ill O.T.U. in the bahamas.   Czechoslovak crews started training in this O.T.U. in June 1943.Recruiting for and future of the Czechoslovak Air Force.161. During the last three months only 17 recruits have been obtained. the monthly requirement for aircrew alone is about twice that number.162. In North America recruiting has failed, and the czechoslovak government appear to be adamant in refusing to allow more of their army personnel to volunteer for service with their Air Force. It seems inevitable,therefore, once Czechoslovaks now in training have passed into first-line units,that wastage in Squadrons will, slowly at first but with gathering momentum,reduce the Czechoslovak Air Force to very small proportions.163. Nevertheless,. the Czechoslovak Government have thought fit at this juncture to approach the Foreign Office with the request that their Agreementwith His Majesty&apos;s Government should be revised to permit their Air Force towithdraw from the R.A.F.V.R. and achieve, in name at all events, a greater measure of autonomy than it at present enjoys.
Education.164. Posts have been sanctioned on the establishment of the CzechoslovakDepot for a number of Czechoslovak Education officers, who will be commis-sioned in the R.A.F.V.R. and be attached for duty to Czechoslovak Squadrons andto R.A.F. Units where Czechoslovaks are under training. These officers willconstitute the nucleus of a Czechoslovak Air Force Education Service.The Royal Hellenic Air Force.Operations and Morale.165. All three Squadrons have been operational in the Middle East, andalthough no details of operations have been received, reports indicate that taskswere satisfactorily performed..   Morale was generally satisfactory also.Royal Yugoslav Air Force.Operations.166. No operational unit at present exists, but some Yugoslav pilots are serving in R.A.F. Squadrons. Middclle East Command expect to be able to forma Yugoslav Flight in a Royal Air Force Fighter Squadron before the end of theyear and one in a Royal Air Force Light Bomber Squadron early in 1944.Pending the formation of the second flight any operationally trained Yugoslavcrews will serve in R.A.F. Squadrons.Morale.167. Morale appears to be strengthening and good reports have beenreceived of the aircrews and maintenance personnel now in refresher courses.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W..1,10th July, 1943.[25729 Ji)
