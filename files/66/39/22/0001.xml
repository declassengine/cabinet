THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT -Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 322.19 th July, 1943.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR SETTLEMENT-POLICY IN RESPECT OF GERMANY.Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister.I think that we ought to realise that our policy in respect of Germany iscardinal to any plan for Europe. We are all agreed that we can have no dealings with the Nazis, but I have discerned in our discussions a tendency to think thatwe should have to treat with some kind of German authority without specifyingwhat this should or should not be. After the last war the Kaiser was made thescapegoat for Germany and at a later stage the democratic parties were made thescapegoats for Versailles, while all the time the real aggressive elements were leftuntouched to raise their heads again when a favourable opportunity occurred.What are these ? Primarily the Prussian Junker class with its strong roots in theReichswehr and the Civil Service. This class, which has in the course of the last century come to dominate Germany, allied itself to the masters of heavy industryin Westphalia and elsewhere with their special interest in armaments. To thisevil combination were added South German elements, which grew strong inBavaria after the Kapp Putsch. This is the real hard core of German aggression,in my opinion. How far it used the Nazis and how far the Nazis made use of itmay be open to debate, but it is not out of the question for it at some time to liquidate Hitler and his gang and to come forward as the only body which can savecentral Europe from anarchy. Some General will no doubt provide a convenientfigurehead under the guise of an honest and honourable fighting man to play the role of Hindenburg.2. These forces maintained themselves at the end of the last war, with thepractical consent of the Allies, because of the fear of Bolshevism. We must notlet this happen again or we shall be leaving in the ground the roots of anotherworld war. So long as&quot; these elements remain intact all idea of encouragingparticularist tendencies is moonshine. - The Prussian virus has spread very widelythrough the German Reich.  It will take very strong action to eradicate it.3. It may well be that East Prussia will be overrun by the Russians and theJunkers therein liquidated. It may be that in the general confusion Poles andCzechs may wreak a terrible vengeance on their oppressors. It may be, and Ishould hope, that the Germans themselves will deal with some of these elements,but I am convinced that very positive action will have to be taken by the victoriousPowers, if there is to be a new orientation of the German nation. It will certainly not be enough to put a cordon sanitaire round Germany, leaving these evil butpowerful elements in a position to reassert themselves. Merely forbidding theGermans to have aircraft or aircraft factories will not be enough. As the foreign secretary says, there must be very close control of the German economic machine.4. As I understand it, Goering has managed to get control over a consider-able section of German industry. -When Goering is liquidated, I see no reason foi&apos;handing this over to German capitalists. I see no reason either why we should allow the big capitalist combines to continue. Germany has devastated Europe.I see no reason why her industries should not be controlled in the interests ofEurope. Let her workers have good conditions, but let these.industries be operated in the interests of Central and South-Eastern Europe. The great areas to theEast and South-East of Germany require capital equipment in order to raise thestandard of life of the inhabitants; let German industry be used for this purpose,but let the control be taken out of the hands of Germans. There is poetic justice in this. Germany has conscripted millions of European workers for her war.Let us put the Germans to work for them in peace. But this cannot be done if theGerman official is left in control.C. R. A.II Downing Street,19th July, 1943.Copy No.[25780]
