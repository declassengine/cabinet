THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 321.19th July, 1943.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR  SETTLEMENT   AND  THE  UNITED  NATIONS   PLAN.Memorandum by the Secretary or State for Dominion Affairs.1. I welcome the broad outline for the post-war world political machinerydescribed in the Prime Ministers paper W.P. (43) 233. I agree with.theForeign Secretary on the significance of United States approval for any such scheme.2. Dominion Participation.A feature to which the Dominions will attach particular importance is theprovision for Dominion representation. I suggested in my paper W.P. (43) 244that on the major international bodies we should aim at securing a seat for atleast one other member of the British Commonwealth besides the United Kingdom.I am glad to see that both the Foreign Secretary&apos;s scheme and Mr. Welles&apos;s ideaswould allow of this (W.P. (43) 292 and W.P. (43) 300).3. Consultation zvith the Dominions.It will be important to secure not merely the acquiescence of the dominions in whatever proposals we put forward eventually, but an assurance of their support and active co-operation. I regard the Prime Minister&apos;s scheme aselaborated by the Foreign Secretary as, in general, a suitable basis of discussionwith the Dominions. The following considerations arise from the Dominion pointof view :  Machinery.4. World Council.While I entirely agree on the need for leadership and unanimity on the partof the United Kingdom, the United States and Russia in whatever World council may be set up, I suggest that the scheme would have an easier passage with theDominions and smaller foreign countries if we seek to proceed by way of a world council of Eleven (this is the figure mentioned by Mr. Welles), or some suchnumber, who could request the World Powers to take action in an agreed sense,or could empower the World Powers to act as they thought fit, than if the WorldPowers at the outset constitute themselves into a Supreme. Council, only callingsmaller countries into consultation as they judge necessary. There have been clear indications that the latter course would be disliked in Canada, and, havingregard to the attitude sometimes adopted by the United States and Russiatowards the international status of the Dominions, it would not offer any certainty that the voice of the Dominions would be heard directly on the supreme body.5. Regional Arrangements.From the Dominion angle, I agree that regional groupings,, properlyorganised, with provision for the necessary co-operation inter se such as by the atlantic and Pacific defence systems proposed, offer as good a chance as any of ensuring co-operation in maintenance of the peace. As I understand it theUnited Kingdom, United States and Russia would be members of a number ofgroupings or systems, but other countries where their interests justify itmight also be members of more than one body.   Canada, who should clearly be a[25781]Copy * No.II
member of an American regional group, but also falls on both the Atlantic andPacific, is a case in point. I share the Foreign Secretary?s doubt of Canada&apos;swillingness to join the Pan-American Union, as long as the Pan-American union is solely concerned with the Americas. But I am not sure that this would holdgood if the Pan-American Union were presented, as it is under this scheme, as a regional part of a world organisation. It will of course be of the highest importance to secure that the regional organisation does not impair the unity ofthe British Commonwealth. Australia, for instance, might play a leading partamong the countries of the Pacific Region (after the World Powers), but only ifit were known that she would be backed by the full weight of the BritishCommonwealth, if the need arose. I comment later on the effects in this directionof the settlement in Europe.6. South A frica.The Union of South Africa is not mentioned in th&amp;Foreign Secretary^ paper,but she will certainly aspire to a major role in a colonial regional system in southern Africa and, if the Atlantic Regional Defence System were divided intoa northern and a southern zone, I think that the Union should be included in thelatter.7. &quot;Far East &quot; and &quot;Europe:&apos;I hope that in the names of the Councils we shall be able to avoid the use ofthe term &quot;Far East.&quot; It is often taken in Australia and New Zealand to imply that that, area is far from our thoughts and our plans. A possible alternative would be &quot; Asia and the Pacific.&quot; Or might we also get round some Americansuspicions if we proposed a &quot; Council of the West &quot; for Europe and Africabalanced by a &quot; Council of the East &quot; for Asia and the Pacific ?.   The European Settlement.8. General Considerations.British policy has for long been influenced by the dual position of the british isles, at once on the fringe of the Continent of Europe, and the heart of a worldempire. We tried to ensure that Continental commitments should not be suchas to prevent our throwing a sufficient force behind any part of the overseas empire which might be threatened. Our ideal was a state of equilibrium in Europe which left our military resources free to meet contingencies overseas. We may have torecognise that no stable equilibrium in Europe is likely to be attainable for along time to come. But, if we have to undertake Continental commitments foran indefinite period ahead, we shall during that time be so much the less ableto throw our weight behind the oversea Members of the Commonwealth. Weshould, in fact, be banking on the chance that no major attempt will be madeoutside Europe to upset the world settlement until the state of affairs in Europepermitted us to withdraw or disperse our forces. On the other hand, we cannot afford to take risks in Europe, particularly in an age of air power, and as furtherjustification we could point to the fact that all major wars in the past haveoriginated in Europe, and that if, by accepting greater Continental obligationsthan heretofore, we can keep the European peace, it will profit both the UnitedKingdom and the Dominions to take the lesser risks overseas.9. A attitude of the Dominions.I expect the Dominions to be greatly influenced in their attitude to our proposals by that of the United States. If the United States is willing to join in policing Europe, I do not anticipate Dominion objections to any settlement onwhich the United Kingdom and the United States are agreed. If the UnitedStates will not provide a due part of the force necessary to uphold the settlement in Europe, the European Allies would presumably look to us to maintain it, andwe should have to leave the United States to look after the East. The effects wouldbe, firstly, that the international position of the Dominions would be weakenedin their Regions, since they could only count on something less than full military support from us, and, secondly, that the increased reliance which they would be led to place on the United States might have a disruptive effect on the BritishCommonwealth. Thirdly, there would be the increased risk of rivalry betweenthe Great Powers, as suggested by the Foreign Secretary. The conclusion is that,in the interests of the solidarity of the British Commonwealth, we should hesitate
again to enter, without the United States, into any military guarantee of the locarno type, i.e., a Continental obligation not shared by the Dominions. TheDominions, for their part, would probably be opposed to the acceptance of any obligation involving the use of force which is not shared by the United States.10. It follows that the Dominions are likely to welcome enthusiastically the negotiation of continuing agreements with the United States, the continuance ofStaff conversations with them, and the co-ordination of British and Americanforeign policy. They would, however, certainly expect to be associated in some suitable way with any such arrangements.11. Common Citizenship.As regards the proposal for some form of common citizenship, the dominions would probably feel less difficulty over according civic rights to United states citizens after they had resided for a qualifying period than in giving the uncon-ditional right of immigration and settlement especially having regard to the colour problem. A British subject already has a common status which is recognised &quot;throughout the Empire, but is not exempt from immigrationrestrictions or entitled to exercise civic rights in a Dominion until he has qualifiedby residence. In effect, therefore, this proposal would amount to giving a similar&apos;&apos; common status &apos;&apos; to British and Americans throughout&apos; the Empire and theUnited States.12. Common Use of Bases.The common use of bases would, I feel sure, be welcome in principle, but the exact proposals to be made, and their implications, would, need careful considera-tion. Are we thinking only of Colonial bases ? If the United Kingdom and theDominions were to be included, the result for the Dominions would probably- bethat the United States would avail themselves of, say, Sydney or Auckland morethan Australia or New Zealand, with their small naval and air forces, would usePago Pago or Honolulu. * We might have to keep a larger British naval forcein the Pacific than hitherto merely for the sake of &quot; showing the flag.&quot; Moreover,all the Dominions might be chary of anything more than the occasional use oftheir air bases by United States air forces. But, subject to closer definition indetail, I have little doubt that the broad proposal would warmly commend itselfto the Dominions.13. Procedure.When an outline scheme has been approved by the War Cabinet, I thinkthat the next step should be consultation with the Dominions. The best oppor-tunity for reaching definite understandings with them would be at the meetingof Prime Ministers which has been proposed for this y^ear. It was originallyhoped to hold it this summer, but the Dominion replies to this suggestion showed that it could not be held so soon, because of general elections impending inAustralia, New Zealand and South Africa. The South African election has now taken place, and it looks as though the other two should, be complete - in time toarrange a meeting abqutNfi^embwr- All the Prime Ministers are known to attach importance to effective preparatory work being done before the meetings. i suggest, therefore, that our ideas should be put to the Dominions by telegraph,and that our procedure might be roughly as follows :  (1) Preliminary consultation with the Dominions by^ telegraph.(2) In the light of preliminary Dominion views in reply to (1), consultationwith the United States and Soviet Governments.(3) Fuller exchange of views with Dominion Prime Ministers at a meetingtowards the end of 1943. This would take account of any indications that we had by then received of the views of the United States and soviet Governments and possibly other foreign Governments. -&apos; (4) As suggested, in paragraph 14 of W.P. (43) 244, preparations for thisfuller exchange might, be made by informal and exploratory talks with dominion officials.C: P. A.Dominions Office,ldth July, 1943.
