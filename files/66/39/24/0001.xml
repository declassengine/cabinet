THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943. . ..SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 324.20th July, 1943.WAR CABINET.ft    THE NEED FOR DECISIONS.Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Labour and national Service and the Home Secretary.THERE is in the Chancellor&apos;s notes on &quot; The Need for Decisions &quot; (W.P.(43) 308) a reference to the Home Secretary&apos;s speech which appears to suggestsome inconsistency between it and the present paper. The points he made inParliament were (1) that the Government had in principle reached a number of decisions onBeveridge;(2) that no commitment would be entered into until the cost had beenconsidered in relation to other possible financial claims;(3) that there was to be a further statement of policy to Parliament as soonas possible.No indication was given either that there would or that there would not belegislation before the end of the war. No indication was given that the con-sideration of the finances of Beveridge in relation to other financial claims could lead to no decision until the end of the war. No such implication arises unless it be assumed that no war-time forecast of the post-war financial position ispossible, an assumption which the recent Treasury forecast would effectivelydestroy.The paper &quot; The Need for Decisions &quot; (W.P. (43) 255) was presented in thehope of clearing away obstacles to the formulation of policy on those urgentquestions of reconstruction on which much work must be done before the end ofthe war. Among those obstacles we thought there might be reckoned a certainpossible misunderstanding as to what action was needed, and what could resonably be expected, from a government constituted and situated as this one is.The Chancellor&apos;s paper confirms our view that there has been suchmisunderstanding, and we hope it can now be resolved for when it is, there will still remain many Jong and complicated tasks to be performed, and time is growing short.The Chancellor believes that our proposals are inconsistent with the PrimeMinister&apos;s broadcast, and notably that the taking of decisions involving financial commitments would be so. We disagree. If that were the case, how could theGovernment have adopted various recent changes in pensions policy, both warand civilian ? vTake again the quotations in the Chancellors paper from the text of the broadcast. The first quotation is a warning against agitation for the Govern-ment to enter irresponsibly into commitments without due study of the forwardcircumstances.   With this we are in full agreement.The second is a reminder that only governments can propose expenditure andthe means of meeting it. We take this as a warning against outside pressuregroups. We agree with it. In quoting the passage the Chancellor has italicisedthe words &quot; of the day.&quot; This seems to suggest that he takes the statement as meaning that no government can enter into any commitment binding upon a subsequent government, but this.is so obviously contrary to all past practice and,indeed, to the elementary necessities of government, that we are uncertain whetherthis can, in fact, be his point.The third quotation is a refusal&apos;to make irresponsible promises.[25779]
The fourth is a reference to a plan consisting of five or six large practical measures which must be shaped and presented to the country after the war. Weare unable to see the relevance of this quotation to the paper &quot; The Need for decisions.&quot; Obviously, it does not mean that no measure which might have any relation to this post-war plan can be decided upon, indeed implemented.,beforehand otherwise we should not now be discussing the housing programme,the Education Bill and the Prime Ministers paper, &quot; The Structure of a Post-War Settlement &quot;. (W.P. (43) 233). Nor can it mean that no earlier commitmentscan be entered into in relation to matters which might form part of the plan,for the reference in the two final quotations to &quot; preliminary legislativepreparation &quot; rules out any such interpretation.Indeed, the main relevance of the six quotations from the Prime Minister&apos;broadcast culminating as they do with the words &apos;*&apos; no promises, but everypreparation, including where required, preliminary legislation,&quot; seems to be toshow how fully consistent the two texts are.We entirely agree with the Chancellor&apos;s points that valuable progress hasbeen made, more especially in very recent weeks, with the examination of post-warfinancial prospects, and that the recent deliberations of the P.R. Committee canbe made to play a valuable part in enabling the Government to make up its ownmind on some important issues.C. R. A.E. B.H. M.
