^rpTTR DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .CRET. WAR CABINET. Copy No..       ^-yjij) 31k.        WAR PENSIONS - PENSIONS APPEAL TRIBUNALS BILL.July. 19U3. Memorandum by the*Minister of Pensions. &apos; &quot; &apos; .In accordance with the instructions of the War Cabinet at-their meeting on the 8th July, W..M.  (1+3) 95th Conclusions,Minute 2, the Attorney General and I have again considered thequestion whether the Pensions Appeal Tribunal Bill should heamended to provide the additional rights of appeal discussed atthat meeting.    The Lord President kindly assisted &quot;by joiningwith us in meeting a,representative group of members of theHouse of Commons who had shown special interest in this matter.We have also had a discussion with.the Lord Chancellor on this and other points affecting the Bill.    In viev/ of the urgentdesire that the Committee stage of the Bill should be taken onThursday next I now submit the results of our discussions for decision by the War Cabinet.It was generally agreed at the meeting of members mentionedabove that the right of appeal should not be extended to the many miscellaneous or discretionary decisions of the Ministerand the only question left in doubt related to assessments ona temporary basis.    On this question all the members whom weinterviewed expressed themselves as strongly in favour of granting the right of appeal and in the present temper of theHouse we are agreed that there is no^ hope of inducing them to&quot;   modify their attitude.    Moreover we ourselves feel that,although there are arguments against the proposal, the balance is definitely in its favour, since without this right of appeallarge numbers- of men will have to wait a long time beforehaving an opportunity of challenging the assessments made by mymedical officers, i.e. until they receive the final settlementsagainst which the Bill provides a right of appeal at a later date.      &apos; -At the same time I am bound to point out that the &quot;immediate grant of an appeal against an interim assessmentinvolves practical difficulties so serious as to endanger thesuccessful working of the appeals already included, in the Bill.It has already been recognised that under present conditions,especially in respect of man-power, it is necessary to begin the work of the Tribunals on a scale which may not be adequate for the full number of appeals submitted.    It is,  of course,Ihoped that reasonable progress can be made from the outset:    itis also hoped that the preparation of cases by the Ministry andthe ou-tput of the Tribunals can be speeded up before there isground for serious complaint of delay.    This can be achievedonly by increasing the staff employed on the work in theMinistry and by adding to the number of Tribunals.My Department is already faced with a most formidable taskin giving effect to the changes announced-in the White Paper,which involve the rapid review of many thousands of cases,  andin starting the appeal work created by the present.Bi11.  .Afurther accession of work, on a large scale cannot be undertakenunless we are allowed to make a substantial increase in ourstaff and are able to obtain persons with the required standard .of ability:    this will be extremely difficxilt, if not impossible, under present conditions and I am particularlydoubtful about the possibility of obtaining the requirednumber
number of doctors who have the necessary qualifications and are willing to move to Blackpool (where the hulk of theMinistry&apos;s work i s done).Again,  if appeals against interim assessments were toserve their purpose effectively rapid decisions would heessential and. these could only he secured at the cost of delay in the settlement of the other and more important appealsAlternatively the interim -assessments might run out and &quot;bereplaced by fresh decisions of the Ministry before they had come before the Tribunals for review.   ,It has been suggested that the practical difficulties might be met by allowing the right of appeal only when the pensioner had had interim assessments for two years, butthis would not meet the immediate situation since there arealready lij.,000 cases in which interim assessments at ratesbelow 100% have been in force for over two years and thenumber is increasing from day to day.    I do not suggest thatall,  or nearly all,  of these would wish to ; appeal, hut,  asappellants will run little risk of losing by their appeals,many may be expected to take their chance of gaining.On&apos; the above grounds I would urge very strongly that,while the Bill should authorise the desired appeal against an interim assessment after the man has been on the pension rollfor two years, it should also provide that it is not to comeinto operation until a future date when at least the initial press of work on the more important appeals has been overcome.    I feel that this method of meeting Che generalrequest would give reasonable satisfaction to the House andthat the delay in giving effect to it would be accepted as justified&apos;by the exceptional difficulties of the immediatefuture.16th- July,  19U-3.W.W.
