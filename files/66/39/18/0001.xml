THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 318.16th July, 1943.MEMBERSHIP OF TRADE UNIONS BY POLICEMEN ENGAGED on war WORK WHEN OFF DUTY.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. By the Police Act of 1919 a member of a police force is prohibited from being a member of any trade union, and the Act provides that, for the purposeof enabling the Police to bring to notice matters affecting their welfare and efficiency, there shall be&apos;a special organisation known as the Police Federation,of which&apos; the constitution is prescribed by the Act.In ordinary times a police officer is not permitted to undertake other workthan his police work. A policeman is liable to be called on for police duty atany time of the clay or night and cannot be allowed to enter into obligations which may conflict with his police duties. As a special wartime measure,however, an arrangement has been made by which some 300 Metropolitanpolicemen are allowed during their spare time to engage on work of national importance.Some of these men, who were working for a firm of packing-case makers, were asked by the officials of the National Union of Packing Case Makers to join theUnion.   The police officers replied that as policemen they were unable to do so.Sir Walter Citrine then wrote to me on behalf of the General Council of theT.U.C., saying that he had been instructed &quot; to protest against any interpretation of the Police Act of 1919 which restricts the freedom of policemen to belong to a trade union in such circumstances,&quot; and that, in the view of the Council,&quot; if a policeman takes up work outside his normal duties of the police force heshould be able to join the appropriate trade union catering for workers in theemployment which he undertakes.&quot;2. The principle embodied in the Police Act, 1919, is that it is undesirable for the police to seek, remedies for any grievances they may have with regard totheir conditions of employment through the ordinary trade union machinery, andthat they must not become involved in trade disputes. The possibility thatpolicemen might be employed during their spare time in industry was not contemplated when the Act was passed, and I think the General Council ofthe T.U.C. are justified in maintaining that it is an unexpected and unforeseenconsequence of the Act that it should prevent a police officer who during thewar is allowed to engage in some industrial work from joining a trade union which caters for workers engaged in that particular industry.3. There is a much larger number of police officers from both theMetropolitan police force and various provincial forces who have, as a wartimemeasure, been temporarily detached entirely from police duties and allowed totake up full-time occupations of national importance. I am advised that, although there has been special legislation to&apos; preserve the pension rights of these officers,they have ceased to be police officers for the time being, and that, as their member-ship of police forces has been temporarily suspended, there, is nothing to preventtheir joining any Trade Union during the period, for which they are engaged on industrial work.4.   There is nothing to prevent a civil servant engaging in industrial work inhis spare time and I understand that there are probably a number of civil servantsup and down the country who, during the war; are undertaking various forms[25767]Copy No,WAR CABINET.
Home Office, S.W. 1,lUh July, 1943.of industrial work in their spare time. While Section 5 of the Trade disputes act, 1927, prohibits established civil servants from joining any union of whichthe membership is not confined to Crown employees, this Section contains aproviso saying that this prohibition &apos;&apos; shall not prevent a person who, in additionto being an established civil servant is, apart from his service as such, also, engagedin some other employment or occupation from being a member, delegate, orrepresentative of any Trade Union or organisation, of which the primary object is to influence or affect the remuneration or conditions of employment of persons engaged in that employment or occupation.&quot; Accordingly, if an established civil servant spends his spare time in making packing cases there is nothing to preventhim joining the National Union of Packing Case Makers.It must be remembered that the position of the police is not affected by the representations which have been made for an amendment of Section 5 of theTrades Disputes Acts, 1927. This section applies only to established civil servants.The police are not civil servants, and no question arose in 1927 of imposingrestrictions on the police in the matter of trade union &quot;membership because by thePolice Act of 1919 they had already been excluded from participation in any tradeunion activities. Hitherto there has been practically no demand for a repeal or modification of the Police Act, 1919. If, however, this request is refused for asmall concession as regards policemen who during the war are working at a tradein their spare time, the possibility must be contemplated that, in connection withthe representations for amendment of the Trades Disputes Act, a demand may alsobe made that the police should be freed from the restrictions of the Police Act of1919.5. In these circumstances it seems to me right to amend the law by meansof a Defence Regulation so as to allow a member of a police, force who is,&apos; withthe consent of the Chief Officer of Police, engaged in war work when off duty,to join a trade union which is ordinarily concerned with the conditions ofemployment in the trade or occupation in which he is so engaged and is notcomposed-wholly or mainly of persons who are members of a police force.The latter provision will prevent any danger of an ad hoc union being formedcomposed wholly or mainly of police officers who are engaged in industrial work,with a view to its becoming a Policeman&apos;s Union and subsequently concerningitself with the conditions of the police service.6. If such a Regulation is made there should, however, be a proviso thatwhen the special arrangement under which policemen are allowed to under-take industrial work in their spare time comes to an end, the policeman shall cease to be a member of the union.It would not be consistent with the general principle embodied in thePolice Act of 1919 to allow a policeman to be a member of a trade union afterthe circumstances which justify this special concession have ceased to exist.It may be that a police officer who, as a result of his contributions to the union,becomes entitled to some benefit would wish to continue his membership andmight suffer some loss or prospective loss if he ceases to be a member. He will,however, at the time when he joins the union, be aware that his membershipwill be temporary only, and I do not, therefore, think that he will have anyjustifiable complaint on this score.I understand that tlhe rules of some unions may contain provisions regardinge circumstances in which a member can/reoigc from the union and in somecases possibly as to the circumstances in which he can resign. It will benecessary, therefore, to provide in the Regulation that when a police officerceases to be engaged in a non-police occupation his membership of the unionshall come to an end notwithstanding anything in the rules of the union.H.
