July 1943.Copy &quot;No.WAR CABINET.GENERAL de GAULLE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I think my colleagues may be interested to see the annexed note by Mr. Strangof the Foreign Office, about a conversation which M. Cassin, Commissioner forJustice in the former French National Committee, recently had withGeneral de Gaulle.A. E.Foreign Office,21st July, 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 328.2lst July, 1943.Annex.At the end of our conversation on the 17th July about the new arrangements,to be made for jurisdiction over French forces in this country, M. Cassin(Commissioner for Justice in the former French National Committee) gave me the following outline of a private conversation he had with General de Gaullefour days before the General left for North Africa.The General spontaneously gave M. Cassin some reflections on his ownrelations with His Majesty&apos;s Government. The General said that there had beendifficulties with His Majesty&apos;s Government, inseparable from the fact that heand the National Committee had been established on foreign soil. These,however, were of minor importance and would completely pass out of memoryonce French authority was established in Algiers. There had also been a gooddeal of talk about remarks that the General had made about this country, and about remarks that the Prime Minister had made about the General. The Generaladmitted that he was sometimes impulsive in speech, but he was pretty sure thata good number of the remarks attributed both to him and the Prime minister had been maliciously invented. The General then said with the greatest emphasisthat it was essential for France and Great Britain to work in the closest harmonyafter the war. The interests of both countries made this imperative and it wasthe GeneraFs policy, so far as in him lay, to promote this result.W. STRANG.19 /i July, 1943.12112   [25792]
