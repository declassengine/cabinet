I have therefore asked the Deputy Prime Minister to preside over such a Committee, the regularmembers of which should be the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for War. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the other service Ministers, would attend meetings whenever desired by the Chairman.2.   It is proposed that the Committee should be called the Ministerial&apos; Committee on Armistice Terms and Civil Administration, and that its terms ofreference should be : &quot; To consider and where necessary advise the War Cabinet on mattersof detail and execution connected with armistice terms and instruments of surrender; with the Military administration of occupied enemy territory;with the liberation and handing over to territorial Governments of enemyoccupied territories; and with the discussion of such matters with our allies.&quot;3. The Committee will supervise the work of the various official Committeesand Departmental branches working in this field. It will be served, by a Secre-tariat located in the War Cabinet Offices, and found partly from there and partly from the War Office who have a special responsibility for Military administration.Communications with Washington on behalf of the Committee will be handled by this Secretariat.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1.4th August, 1943.[25857]
