THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAr AN NIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT    1 9Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET.Copy No. ii oW.P. (43) 346.5th August, 1943.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES OF NITRATES TO EGYPT.Report by the Shipping Committee.1. The Shipping Committee have had under consideration a proposal for the shipment of 300,000 tons of nitrates to Egypt in 1943-44. The suggested periodof loadings is September 1943 to October 1944 loadings in September and october of 1943 being made in addition to the existing programme.2. The Committee were informed that the earlier history of the matter wasbriefly as follows :  Before the war, Egypt imported annually over 500,000 tons of fertiliser,chiefly Chile nitrate, part of which was used for the production of cotton; duringthe war, the cotton acreage has been considerably reduced, and the applicationof fertiliser to cotton is prohibited. In April 1942 the provision of 200,000 tonsof Chile nitrate to Egypt during 1942 was approved, and in fact about 155,000tons wras actually distributed during that year. As a result of the emergency cut in tonnage to the Indian Ocean Area in the autumn of 1942, the 1943 nitrateprogramme was reduced to 120,000 tons. It is estimated that the continued low rate of application of fertiliser has resulted in the yield of wheat dropping froma pre-war average figure of 31-3 bushels an acre to about 23-8; and the middle east Supply Centre calculate that the margin between consumption and produc-tion, up to mid-1944, will be a narrow one. The most recent report of cropprospects is unfavourable. The Nile flood, is said to be below normal, which is calculated adversely to affect the rice crop.. 3. The Middle East Supply Centre consider that a minimum of 200,000. tonsof nitrate will be required in 1944 if Egypt is to be made self-sufficient in 1945.*They further advise that if an additional 100,000 tons&apos;of nitrate were supplied in 1944 making a total of 300,000 tons there would be a surplus in 1944-45of about 250,000 tons of cereals available for the Forces and for export.4. The Ministry of War Transport advise that the suggested amount of300,000 tons could be shipped, as far as it is possible to say at present, without undue strain. Viewed purely as a long-term shipping question, the propositionis attractive, since for every ton of nitrate shipped above the amount sufficientto meet Egypfs own requirements, from &apos;2\ to 3 tons of cereals should eventually become available for our use in the Middle East. At present, 30,000tons of cereals a month are being imported into Eastern Mediterranean countries from outside the Middle East Area, and this quantity is likely to be substantially increased when liberated territories have to be supplied; it is clear that any surplus available in Egypt during the next few years can readily be absorbedfor immediate consumption in neighbouring territories and will result in the direct reduction of imports into the Area. Further, substantial imports ofnitrates will serve to reassure the Egyptian Government as to their future cerealposition and should facilitate negotiations for the purchase of cereals, sugar,and rice for our use.5. It is, however, essential to ensure that any surplus cereals produced byadditional quantities of fertilisers are in fact made available for our use either for the Services or for export. It is suggested that, if the general proposals is approved, our Ambassador in Cairo should be asked, in co-operation with the* The Egyptian Government take a less optimistic view. They calculate that the expectedyield of some 4.4 million tons from crops sown in 1943 will fall short by about 200,000 tons of egyptian requirements up to May 1944, and that if shipments of nitrate during 1944 remain atthe 1943 level 120,000 tons-there will be an absolute deficiency of 400,000 tons of cerealsin 1945.[25878]
Middle East Supply Centre, to negotiate an agreement under which the egyptian government would make available for disposal by us some stated part of theircereals, rice and sugar surpluses against the import of 300,000 tons of fertilisers.All shipments of fertilisers to Egypt will be the property of the TJ.K.C.C. up tothe time of their arrival in Egypt and can be withheld or diverted at the dis-cretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government.6. Nitrate at present supplied is being shipped direct from Chile to Egypt,but there is a possibility that ammonium nitrate may become available in north america and the Egyptian Government have agreed to accept this in place of the equivalent amount of Chile nitrate if certain technical difficulties can be over-come. The fertilising power of ammonium nitrate is approximately double thatof Chile nitrate, and insofar as ammonium nitrate can be supplied, there will bea conseqtiential saving in shipping space.7. The Shipping Committee asked to be furnished with details as to theproposed programme of shipments and the time at which the benefits from theincrease in shipments could be expected to accrue. This detailed information is summarised below.Nitrates are not used on the rice crop. Apart from a small amount requiredfor sugar cane and vegetables, they are used for (a) seifi crops (mainly millet) fertilised in April-May and harvested inAugust-December;(&amp;) nil crops (mainly maize) fertilised in August and harvested in November;and(c) shetwi crops (mainly wheat) fertilised in December and harvested in-  May-June.The allocation of fertilisers is fixed by a Joint Committee in Cairo comprisingEgyptian, British and American representatives. The maize crop is used for local consumption, but a shortage of maize leads to an increased consumption ofother cereals. No allocations have been made for the 1944 crops, but if 200,000tons of nitrates were available it is probable that 55,000 tons wTould be allocated to millet, 70,000 to maize, and 75,000 to wheat. If 300,000 tons were available,the distribution would probably be 60,000 tons to millet, 90,000 to maize, and150,000 to wheat the additional supplies being used mainly for wheat. Nothing-can be done to increase supplies for the next maize crop, but it is suggested that additional nitrate should be loaded, over and above the existing programme for september and October, but in anticipation of the 300,000 ton programme for1944; so as to arrive in Egypt before the end of this year for allocation to. thewheat crop: this would have a direct effect on the wheat harvest in June 1944.The table set out below gives a suggested programme designed to achieve acereals surplus at the earliest possible date with a programme of 300,000 tons.Month of Shipment.Crop to whichShipmentsapplied.ResultingHarvest.1943-SeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember1944-JanuaryFebruaryMarchApril ...May ...June ...July ...AugustSeptemberOctober10,000 previous programme not included in the 300,00010,000 suggested increase against1944 programme10,000 previous programme not included in the 300,00010,000 suggested increase against1944 programme25,00025,00025,00025,00025,00025,00025,00025,00020,00020,00020,00020,000Shetwi -wheat,1943.Seifi millet,1944I     nil maize,1944.i Shetwi wheat,1944.May 1944.September 1944.November 1944.May 1945.
Provided that conditions are favourable it is estimated that this suggestedprogramme might be expected to provide a cereals surplus, after meetingEgyptian requirements, of about 5.0,000 tons in 1944 and 200,000 tons in 1945.Conclusion.8. The Shipping Committee recommend that approval be given to the shipment of 300,000 tons of nitrates to Egypt on the lines indicated in the table in paragraph 7 above, including shipments in addition to the existing programme in September and October of this year, on the understanding that a firm agree-ment is made with the Egyptian Government that the resulting surplus of cerealsproduction is definitely earmarked for our use for export or for the Services.(Signed on behalf of the Committee),HARCOURT JOHNSTONE, Chairman.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,5th August, 1943.
