A very successful attack was carried out on Aachen, and Cologne and Gelsenkirchen were attacked in force. Harassing raids were kept up against Berlin, Cologne, Munich,Duisburg and Dusseldorf. In Italy, Turin and Switching and Transformerstations in the North were attacked. In France, the Peugeot works at Montbeliardwere raided.Summary of Operations.Number ofAircraftTarget.

This was a blind-bombing attack on the North-Westernindustrial suburbs of the city, which had hitherto escaped comparatively lightly.Reports from crews indicate a successful attack, but no definite knowledge of results has yet been gained.Gelsenkirchen (9th/10th July).Another blind-bombing attack was delivered against Gelsenkirchen by422 aircraft. Preliminary reports are favourable, but Gelsenkirchen is far morescattered than Cologne, and it would be too much to expect spectacular results.This and the attack on Cologne were delivered under weather conditionswhich would have prohibited any serious offensive action without the effectivework of the Pathfinder Force with navigational aids. Even with their assistance,the achievement of the main force in reaching their targets in spite of cloud, icingand high winds is notable. The German night fighters were reduced to relativeimpotence by the conditions prevailing and our losses were in consequence wellbelow the average for Ruhr and Rhineland targets.[25818] - WiiM
Turin (12th/13th July).Weather conditions en route to and from the target were bad, as expected,and icing and cloud were experienced up to 15,000 feet. Visibility over the target, however, was good; markers were dropped punctually and * accuratelyby the Pathfinders and a concentrated attack was reported. Owing to the shorthours of darkness, the return was made via the Bay of Biscay and the S.W.Approaches a total round trip of approximately 2,000 miles.Partial day cover of poor quality, which is all that has so far been obtained,shows that severe industrial damage has been done but no large areas of residential devastation by fire are revealed. Among the damaged factories arethe Fiat Steel Works and the State Arsenal. About 50 fires were still burning onthe day following the attack.Aachen (13th/14th July).Aachen is an important junction on the main railway line from Brussels toCologne and Central Germany. Although it does not compare in industrialoutput with the. great Ruhr and Rhineland centres, the combined production ofits numerous factories, none of them individually of vital significance, was farfrom negligible in total in view of the acute shortage of consumer goods andindustrial components of all kinds from which Germany is suffering more andmore acutely as the bomber offensive progresses. The elimination of thisproduction is, therefore, a valuable contribution to the industrial paralysis whichis being produced in the Ruhr and Rhineland as a whole.The choice of Aachen as a target had the advantage of involving a shorterpenetration of the defence zone in the full moon period than the more importantGerman targets. The attack, which was intended to be delivered blind in conditions of 7/10 to 10/10 cloud, was made easier by breaks in the clouds which occurred in the early stages. A good concentration of fires was started, but,owing to cloud cover, preliminary reports were conservative in their estimates ofthe success achieved. In fact, this was on such a scale that the P.R. aircraftsent out the following morning was prevented from obtaining satisfactoryphotographs by the vast pall of smoke from fires still burning.Excellent day cover which has now been obtained shows that Aachen hasbeen dealt with in a single attack almost as completely as were Krefeld, Barmenand Elberfeld.. Two-thirds of the inner town have been devastated by fire andthe destruction extends to the fully built-up area, mainly industrial, to the east of it. The area involved is estimated at 300 acres, and the number of personswho will need rehousing is probably from 30,000 to 50,000, out of a total population of 160,000. Quite apart from direct industrial damage, this is asubstantial contribution to the &quot; housing blockade of the Reich,&quot; which german propaganda admits is being imposed by persistent bombing.Direct industrial damage is very severe. Twenty-seven of the heavily damaged factories have already been identified, and many of these are practicallywiped out. They include producers of machinery, textiles, leather goods, aswell as an iron and steel foundry.Prints Nos. 1 and 2 show some of the damage caused.The Cathedral, which has naturally figured largely in German reports ofthe attack, appears to be undamaged.Montbelidrd (15th/16th July),The Peugeot Works at Montbeliard are reported to produce about 2,000 2-tontrucks per quarter and to employ between 8,000 and 10,000 workers. They are,therefore, of great importance in view of the known shortage of transportvehicles for the Axis armed forces.The attack was made in conditions of bright moonlight and good visibility.Both crews&apos; reports and night plots indicated a heavy concentration round theaiming point. This is confirmed by day cover, but although seven buildings inthe Works were hit, visible damage is rather less heavy than was expected, themain concentration of. bombs having missed the buildings by a narrow margin.This is an interesting contrast to results achieved by somewhat, less accuratebombing in the industrial areas of the Ruhr and Rhineland, where near misseson factories usually destroy essential housing facilities in the surrounding area.N. Italy: Switching and Transformer Stations (15th/16th and 16th/17th July).The Italian railway system draws its electrical current from switching andtransformer stations, most of which also serve industrial and residential areas,They are in turn fed from power stations in the Alps and Apennines.
The attacks were directed against those stations capable of carrying a heavyload of current, the destruction of which would affect traffic on the militarysupply routes over the Brenner to Bologna and South Italy and through the MontCenis tunnel via Turin and Genoa to the South. The destruction of transformerstations in the Turin, Milan and Genoa area would also affect industrial and domestic supplies.The success achieved is difficult to assess. Crews&apos; reports received from. Africa and partial day cover show that several of the targets were hit, but until full day cover has been obtained and subjected to expert investigation, no definite statement of results can be made. It must be remembered, moreover, thatthe transformers, which are in the open, and not the buildings, were the target.Photographic reconnaissance is therefore unlikely to reveal much obvious damage.Results of Previous Raids.Cologne.Photographs taken on the 4th July give a clear picture of the results achieved by the blind bombing attack made on the central city area on the 28th/29th June.The destruction caused on the 3rd/4th July is largely concealed by large fires still burning in Ueutz and Kalk, but print No. 3 shows damage to the Humbolt Deutzworks.It is provisionally estimated that at least 1,000 acres in the centre of the Cityhave now been 75 per cent, devastated. There is very serious damage at theGereon marshalling yard, where two engine sheds and a very large building havebeen destroyed. The roof of the main station has been burnt off and the adminis-trative offices severely damaged.Photographic evidence suggests that little damage was caused to theCathedral on this occasion, and this is confirmed by the fact that the german press have now written down the highly coloured atrocity stories issued to theworld immediately after the attack.Print No. 4, which covers a relatively small section of the city, is a sample ofthe devastation caused in the entire central area. Hardly any buildings haveescaped destruction or severe damage. It is interesting to notice that, althoughthe photograph was taken at 1300 hours on a fine Sunday morning there arehardly any signs of human activity. No trains can be seen in Cologne main station, and only one is observed leaving the City. Nothing appears to behappening in the Gereon marshalling yard of which part is seen at the bottom ofthe photograph. Hardly any pedestrian or vehicular traffic is visible in the streetsor round the Cathedral and only a few trams appear to be operating. Only oneRhine steamer is in action and no traffic is seen on the Hohenzollern and Hinden-burg bridges or their approaches. This is a remarkable contrast to the state ofthe London streets and squares on the days following heavy German attacks andsuggests that the life of Cologne has been largely paralysed.On the East Bank (not covered by this photograph) very heavy damage canbe seen, in spite of the prevailing smoke, throughout Kalk, Deutz, Buchheim andS. Mulheim. This is especially severe in the Humboldt Deutz factories, which areof the greatest importance in German war production. Details cannot be dis-cerned, but the following have also certainly suffered : Kalk Chemical Factory.Westdeutsche Waggonfabrik.Citroen Works (at Poll).Mannesmann Rohren fiber Eisenhandel (at Westhafen).These are only a small proportion of the total, but it is clear that heavy damage has also been done to railways and docks in this area.Print No. 5 shows damage at the Nippes railway workshops.dusseldorf.Final interpretations of the photographic cover of dusseldorf fully confirmspreliminary reports on the overwhelming devastation caused by the attack on the11th/12th-June. 64 factories were more or less severely damaged. 14 of -theseare known to have been directly concerned with German war production, and these include the most important war undertakings in dusseldorf, Schiess Defries andRheinmetall Borsig A.G. These produce heavy machine tools and all types of heavy armament.[25818] b 2
At least 135 goods waggons were destroyed in marshalling yards and sidings.The Main Station was again hit and incalculable damage has been done to ware-houses, store sheds and railway goods depots throughout the City.Over one-third of the business and residential property in the built-up area has been completely destroyed or so damaged as to be useless without major repair work.  Some buildings were still smouldering a week after the attack.Oberhausen.The following gives a general picture of the damage shown by photographs tohave been caused in Oberhausen by recent attacks :  :The district of Oberhausen covers an area of some thirty square miles imme-diately north of Mulheim and east of Duisburg, and although it contains noclosely built-up zones and is comparatively thinly populated, the town is spreadout over a very wide area. There are a number of scattered industrial targets; thelargest and most important, Gutehoffnungshutte A.G. Steelworks, has a numberof points of damage both recent and comparatively old, and Deutsche Babcock u.Wilcox (Boiler Works) has been severely damaged both by H.E. and fire. TheConcordia Bergbau A.G. Coalmines, Pits IV/V, show signs of having receivedsevere damage in the past and, although some buildings are repaired, the recoveryplant and other installations appear inactive.Oberhausen is the highway through which much of the Northern Ruhr trafficpasses to Duisburg. There is severe damage to railway repair workshops andother railway buildings, and two direct hits on the main Duisburg line.Clearance and instances of roof repairs scattered over the whole districtshow, apart from fresh damage, the cumulative results of past raids. although no attempt has been made to separate the old damage from that of recent attacks,there is evidence to show that the raid of the 14th/15th June was concentratedparticularly in the central town area. The whole of Oberhausen is - relatively little built-up less than 40 per cent. but in spite of this there, is considerabledevastation, and heavy damage was caused to many public and other buildings in the town. It is estimated that nearly 1,700 houses and other business buildings have been severely damaged or destroyed in Oberhausen and district.Wuppertal (Barmen).A full examination of the damage done to Barmen by the attack on the29th/30th May has now been completed.It is characteristic of Wuppertal that its industry consists mainly-of smallfactories, the majority of which are situated well within the built-up area. Beforethe war, many of these were known to have been manufacturing textiles, and itis assumed, without evidence to the contrary, that this is so to-day. Prioritieshave been given to 6 factories in Barmen; 5 of these are damaged, and 108 other industrial concerns are affected to some degree, the greater part seriously.A general picture of the devastation can be given by saying that over90 per cent, of the fully built-up areas and more than half of the slightly lessclosely built-up areas are devastated.The most important priority industrial concerns to be seriously damaged arethe Dye Works of J. P. Bomberg, and Vorwork and Co., manufacturers of electriccables and lamp filaments. There are 24 non-priority identified factories, 10 ofwhich are over 75 per cent, destroyed, and 76 unidentified concerns, 33 of whichare over 75 per cent, destroyed. Among the -identified premises areAlex Zimmerman, sheet metal works, completely destroyed, and Vorwork undSohne, manufacturers of solid rubber tyres for tanks, over 50 per cent, destroyed.Public utilities have been widely affected throughout the town and include severe damage to two electric power stations, two gas works, a water works and the main railway station.Wuppertal (Elberfeld).Photographic reconnaissance has so far failed to cover Elberfeld, but severalphotographs show bits of the suburbs. In every case the devastation appears tohave been at least as complete as that in Barmen.   -General.Water Supply.On the 23rd June an official announcement from the Soest water works statedthat &quot;the water supply cannot be carried on as it was before the Moehne
catastrophe. All consumers must comply with the order to exercise the utmosteconomy in water consumption to ensure supply to the higher quarters of thetown and to war industries.&quot;Evacuation.Appeals to those not required to maintain essential industry, especiallywomen and children, to evacuate the Ruhr and relieve the strain on supply andadministrative services are of almost daily occurrence in the German Press. It is admitted that the bombing offensive is becoming a &apos;&apos; housing blockade &apos;&apos; againstthe whole Reich, and that the destruction of whole districts and even of entiretowns constitutes a very serious problem. &quot;A person without a roof over hishead has been liquidated just as effectively as one who is starving.&quot; Everyoneelsewhere in Germany must therefore be prepared to accept refugees so as to leavethe indispensable minimum of accommodation for essential workers in the Ruhr.This disposes effectively of the suggestions (i) that the destruction of house property is not a true military objective;&apos; (ii) that the Ruhr industries have been dispersed to less vulnerable areas.The latter is further exploded by figures recently published in the german press which emphasised the greatly increased consumption of electric power inDortmund in 1942 as compared with the previous year.Mining Results.The following mining successes have been reported : Mid-May.-A Sperrbrecher sustained internal damage due to sweepinga mine at the Northern end of the Kattegat. Another Sperrbrecher wassimilarly damaged at the Southern end of the Kattegat a week later.23rd May. Auxiliary S.V. Erne was mined and sunk in heligoland bight.28 h May. A Sperrbrecher was damaged off St. Nazaire.10th June. The S. English was mined 5 miles N. of Brandso (Little.  Belt).11 th June-Lilly E. was mined off Sylt.12th June. Lisle was mined at the Northern approach to the Sound!13th June. Sperrbrecher 21 (5,000 tons) was mined and sunk in themiddle of the Canal de la Coubre, Bordeaux.14th June. A small minesweeper was damaged off the Gironde.l$th June. Sperrbrecher 18 was seriously damaged whilst sweeping atthe top of the Great Belt.17th June. Narvik was mined and sunk in the Elbe Approaches.Mid-June. A harbour defence vessel was mined and sunk off Lorient.Air Ministry, 2%th July, 1943.A. H. M. S.
