It is issued W-ffor the personal use of most SECRET.W.P. (43) 329.22nd July, 1943.Copy No.-3 war CABINET.DISCUSSION   WITH   THE   UNITED   STATES   GOVERNMENT   OFARTICLE  7  OF  THE MUTUAL  AID  AGREEMENT.Memorandum   by  the  Secretary  of   State   for  Foreign  Affairs,   theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade.1. There are a&apos; number of reasons for thinking that the time is ripe for anattempt to reach preliminary agreement with the United States Government onall the subjects covered by Article 7 of the Mutual Aid Agreement, principallymonetary policy, international investment, the regulation of primary products and commercial policy.   These reasons may be summarised as follows :(a) The friendly relations established at the Food Conference at Hot Springs,between United States and United Kingdom officials, and the help which was lent by the United Kingdom delegation in organising theConference and producing so successful an outcome, have created afavourable atmosphere for further discussions between our twoGovernments.(b) Now that the talks in London with Dominion officials on PostAVarCommercial Policy have been concluded, we are in a position to developour ideas to the United States Government on all the subjects coveredby Article 7 (with the exception of international investment, in regardto which it is to be hoped that the United States Government will takethe initiative).(c) There is reason to believe that the President of the United States mayhave it in mind to call a further international conference to deal withmetals in the same way as the Hot Springs Conference dealt withfood. The suggestion has been made privately to us by a member ofthe State Department that the best w^ay to avoid such a development,which would certainly be unwelcome, wrould be to make a clear andformal statement to the United States Government outlining our ideason the general programme for future discussion of all post-war economic and financial questions.(d) Some progress has been made in discussion of future monetary policy onthe basis of the United States Stabilisation Fund and the UnitedKingdom Clearing Union Plan. It is not desirable that monetarydiscussions should get too far ahead of discussions on other economic questions. At the same, time, the illness of the Treasury represents -tive in Washington, Sir Frederick Phillips, who has been conductingthese discussions, creates a danger that the United States Governmentwill, take the initiative in producing, without consultation with us,further proposals which are not in the general interest. This dangercan best be met by a comprehensive approach, which will give aplausible reason for delay.12113   [25790]
(e) We hope shortly to settle with the United States Government a number of outstanding points connected with lend-lease and reciprocal aid. Aspart of our contribution to this settlement, in the course of which we expect to obtain substantial relief from the limitations at presentimposed on our export trade, we intend, if the War Cabinet approve, toagree to provide raw materials from the British Empire as part of reciprocal aid. It is desirable to take advantage of the favourableatmosphere which these arrangements are likely to produce.(/) If a general approach on ail subjects covered by Article 7 is made, itwill be possible to take the discussions up with the State Departmentrather than through the individual Government Departments whichare concerned with the specialised subjects for discussion. The state department have been charged with general control of United Statespoiicy on all these questions and it is probable that both their hands and ours would be strengthened if the approach is made in this way.2. Hitherto the United States Government haT fought shy of separate and preliminary discussions between themselves and the United KingdomGovernment on post-war matters. They have shown a tendency to open discussions by a simultaneous approach either to the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, Soviet Union and China or to various groupings of interested governments. There is now, however, reason to believe that they will be more favourably inclined to preliminary agreement between our two governments before such questions are discussed in a wider field. This is partly due to theeffect produced at Hot Springs by the preliminary, though informal, agreement reached between us about the scope and procedure of the Conference, and partly to the difficulties which arose through the adoption of a ^different procedure in connexion with the monetary discussions. Many of the smaller Powers havelet it be known that they are only too anxious for a definite lead by the UnitedKingdom and Uniteid States Governments acting in agreement; and provate conversations between the State Department and members of His Majesty&apos;s embassy at Washington confirm the belief that the State Department are now more disposed to attempt preliminary if informal agreement between our twoGovernments. It may be that the State Department will actually welcome their hands being forced by some action on our part which will precipitate a decisionon this issue.3. There are, in our view, overwhelming advantages &apos;in agreeing with theUnited States Government a programme covering the whole field of Article 7before attempts are made to deal piecemeal with the single subjects involved.All these subjects are very closely related and no final solution of one can bereached before considerable progress has been made with all the rest. On general grounds, therefore, it is most important that discussions on all these subjectsshould be kept as far as possible in line. The question arises, however, whether,if a general approach on these lines is approved, we should delay giving to theUnited States Government our views on Post-War Commercial Policy whichhave now reached a more definite form as a result of discussions with Dominionofficials in London. The clanger of such delay is that the United States Govern-ment, having obtained the renewal of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act,may press for the resumption of bilateral and piecemeal negotiations and thusprejudice the multilateral approach which we have in mind. Moreover, theGovernments of the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Unionof South Africa are anxious to pursue these bilateral negotiations with theUnited States, since in their case, though not in ours or in Canada&apos;s, there still remains scope under the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act for the United states to effect tariff reductions that would be of considerable benefit to them. Therefore,the longer that our approach to the United States is delayed, the more difficultwill it be to restrain these Governments. On the other hand, the prospects ofsuccess for our multilateral approach on Post-War Commercial Policy will be greatly improved if it takes its place in a general programme covering the wholeeconomic and financial field. It will in this way be seen in its proper perspectiveas an essential feature in the general solution of the problems covered by Article 7.For these reasons we think that, if our ideas on Post-War Commercial policy could be put forward as part of a general approach on all subjects covered by article 7, we should improve our chances of success even though it entailed some slight postponement of the approach on this subject.
4. We suggest that the best procedure for discussion with the United StatesGovernment would be to send out a strong delegation from this country whichwould be capable of covering all the subjects comprised under Article 7. this procedure would be economical of man-power, a matter which also interests theUnited. States Administration, and would ensure the most expeditious disposalof the agenda. The delegation should be composed of senior officials under the leadership of a Parliamentary Under-Secretary; we would see advantages in theParliamentary Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs being its leader, since thiswould emphasise the formal and comprehensive nature of the approach to theState Department.   The chief functions of the delegation would be : (a) To agree with the United States Government on an orderly agenda forthe discussion of Article 7 of the Mutual Aid Agreement.(b) To carry on concurrently,  as occasion  might  arise,  more  detailed discussions on the separate items such as monetary policy, commodityregulation and commercial policy. With progress made along thiswider front the point might be&apos; reached where a transition couldbe made to a monetary conference in the first place. This wouldbecome the first of a series of other conferences on related, subjects,Upon which exploratory discussions would meanwhile continue. It is most important that there should be the minimum of delay, and wetherefore suggest that the delegation should aim at arriving in washington during the first half of September. If it is considered desirable to avoid publicity, the various members of the delegationcould, reasonably go out under cover of the Relief Conference or possibly the Interim Food Commission discussions, which are. likelyto be in progress about that date.5. As a first step towards giving effect to these proposals we recommend thata telegram in the terms of the draft attached as an Annex should be despatchedforthwith to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington.A. E.K. W.H. D.22nd July, 1943.ANNEX.Draft Telegram to Lord Halifax (Washington).RECENT experience, derived from the Hotsprings Conference and the monetary talks, points with increasing insistence to the absolute necessity in suchmatters as these of obtaining broad Anglo-American informal agreement before embarking on multilateral discussions. There is reason to believe that this view,which we have always held, is now coming to be more and more shared by the americans.2. Concurrently with this development a variety of circumstances (detailsof which are set out in the memorandum of which you have already received acopy) suggest that the moment is ripe for approaching the State Departmentformally with a proposal for informal exploratory United. States-United Kingdomtalks at any early date on all the subjects covered by Article 7 of the Mutual aid agreement.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider this is an opportunity not to beneglected. They are impressed by the advantages which would accrue from a comprehensive treatment of these subjects. In particular, they think it wouldbe wiser to make the specific approach to&quot; the United States Government on post-war commercial policy (on the general lines suggested in my telegrams nos. 2668-2671) as part of the general discussion of the subjects covered by article 7; if our proposals on post-war commercial policy are dealt with as partof this general framework, we shall improve the prospects of a successful outcomefor our discussions on this subject. -4. Provided you see no objection, therefore, I shall be glad if you will speakpersonally to Mr. Hull on the lines of the following paragraphs, leaving with himan aide-memoire in the same sense.
5. In November 1942 the United States Government informed His Majesty&apos;sGovernment (your telegram No. 5573) through the United States Ambassador inLondon that they looked forward to informal and exploratory talks withrepresentatives of Great Britain and other Powers in accordance with Article 7of the Mutual Aid Agreement, and invited His Majesty&quot;s Government either tosend a delegate for the purpose or to nominate some member of the british embassy in Washington to represent them. His Majesty&apos;s Government at thetime nominated Sir F. Phillips and Mr. Opie for this purpose, but did not other-wise pursue the Linked States suggestion, as discussions of some parts of theground covered by Article 7. viz.. monetary policy, were already in progress, whileother parts were felt by His Majesty*s Government to require some preliminarystudy on their part.6. Having now been able to carry further their examination of the varioustopics, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that the moment has come to initiate withthe United States Government informal and exploratory talks on the whole fieldcovered by Article&apos;7, and that it is important for these talks to start without delay.They are strengthened in this view by the repeated requests made by our smallerallies for a. lead by the United States and United Kingdom. They see great advantage in handling the essentially inter-related matters covered by Article as a coherent whole. In pursuance, therefore, of the United States suggestionmentioned in the preceding paragraph they intend, if the United States Govern-ment see no objection, to send to Washington not later than the first half ofSeptember a strong delegation of officials led by a Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State which would be capable of dealing with ail these subjects and, inparticular, monetary policy, international investment, the regulation of primary products and commercial policy. His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that the primary object of such talks should be to obtain broad United States-UnitedKingdom agreement on an orderly agenda for the discussion of Article 7. HisMajesty&apos;s Government continue, as in the past, to regard with the greatest importance the attainment of prior agreement on such matters between our twoGovernments before they are discussed in a wide international field. the delegation would also be in a position to push further the talks on monetary policy which have already begun, so as to pave the way for a general monetaryconference, which might itself be the prelude to a series of international con-ferences on the post-war monetary and economic problems which call for solution.7. The arrival of such a delegation should not excite undue curiosity, as its members could go out ostensibly to attend the Relief Conference projected for september, or discussions of the Interim Commission on Food.8. The adoption of this suggestion would, of course, cut across what weunderstand to be the time schedule proposed by Mr. Harry White for the monetarydiscussions. But we feel sure that he will recognise the difficult position in which sir F. Phillip&apos;s illness has placed us and that this would, in any case, have made it impossible for us to fall in with his proposed arrangements.9. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to know whether this suggestion would be open to any objection on the part of the United States Government. Ifnot, they would proceed to nominate their delegation forthwith.
