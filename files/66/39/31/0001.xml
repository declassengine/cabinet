(43) 331.24 A July, 1943.WAR CABINET.RECIPROCAL AID TO U.S.A.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.IN mid-August the President of the U.S.A. has to present to Congress his report on Lend-Lease. Although the Lend-Lease Appropriation went throughmuch more smoothly than was expected, and our own part in reciprocal aid waswell told by the Administration spokesman,&apos; the Administration still regard theposition as vulnerable. I understand that the President proposes to put thesubject over in a big way and to present this &quot; pooling of resources &quot; as an illus-tration and a symbol of the common effort. For this purpose we are being urged to make some important changes in our procedure and, to give substantial concessions. Some developments of these might have far-reaching consequences for us and I must therefore put the story fully before my colleagues.2.   I am clear that we should do all that we can do, quickly and withoutungenerous reservations.   It is in our interest to help the President in the&apos;policy of extending the principle of pooling resources, especially as this will help to create an atmosphere in which the Administration will feel bound to stand by us and to maintain our point of view before Congress.3. The subject covers three related matters, the valuation of reciprocal aid,the grant of raw materials and associated Shipping Services as reciprocal aidrand the position of our gold and dollar balances.4. Although the President originally declared that the dollar sign would notbe in lend-lease, it is inevitably introduced when the Appropriation is askedfor, and this gives a hostile Congress opportunity for questions and comparisons.Two developments within the last two weeks have shown us that the Administra-,tion is sensitive to pressure from Congress on the valuation of lend-lease andreciprocal aid.5. Within the last few days, the American War Department, without notice to us, have instructed their Army Commands to obtain a value for all reciprocal aid given by Foreign Governments, to put their own value on it if they do not obtain a value or do not agree with it, and to base the valuation on the cost to thesupplying country.6. The proposal is highly objectionable. On the general principle of anitemised valuation of reciprocal aid, I spoke in the early part of my Budget State-ment, from which I quote some of the relevant words : &quot; The Committee will appreciate that the total cost of all this reciprocal aid is a very large sum. We do not attempt to keep close accounts. It wouldtake a whole division of accountants and clerks to keep such figures, and wecannot spare them for such a purpose. If we take the Lend-Lease aid nowbeing furnished to the United Kingdom, apart from the additional aid toBritish Armies overseas, and make a rough comparison on the same scale of costs and values, the Committee should know that, large though the help fromthe United States is, it is no greater than the help we ourselves are affordingto all our Allies without charge. Having regard to the comparative size of our. Valuation of Reciprocal Aid.[25766]b
population and to the proportion of men and women we have already absorbed in the Forces and to the longer period in which we have been bearing thestruggle, the scale of our reciprocal help is one of-which we need not beashamed.&quot;7. It is a statement of fact that to do what the War Department instructioncontemplates would require thousands of clerks and accountants. Our reciprocal aid to the United States does not take the form of large block shipments. it covers services,large like the construction of airfields, and also very small; it includes an enormous variety of items, big and small, given in the daily intercourseof the war effort. Whatever the American Forces ask for, we give it if we have it.But we cannot afford the man-power to sweep up all these transactions into aledger.8. It is objectionable, too, in the proposed method of valuation. At presentthe greater part of the lend-lease to us is munitions, and American prices are atleast 50 per cent, higher than ours. You cannot compare dollar and sterling costson the ordinary exchange value in such circumstances. Moreover, although ourreciprocal aid to the United Nations as a whole represents substantial figures,* value of the aid given to the United States, especially on the basis of costs shownat the ordinary exchange rates, in comparison with the Appropriation figures forlend-lease, which include munitions and food, may seem small to a pin-prickingCongress. I do not believe that tactically this way of presentation will help thePresident and I should hope that we can secure the withdrawal of the war department&apos;s order.9. More important, and more sensible, is the approach made by the state department and the Lend-Lease Administration which is summarised in telegram 115 REMAC. There we are asked, in substance, to produce a valua-tion of such reciprocal aid as can be.valued, and to describe the nature and extent of aid which is not susceptible of monetary equivalence. Mr. Harrimanhas personally pressed strongly for the acceptance of this proposal.10. Although ordinarily I should be reluctant to embark upon anystatistical calculations in this connection, as they will lead to comparisonsand are not really consistent with the doctrine of the pooling of resources withoutstint,. I do not think we can refuse the request or pretend that we have no ideaof what we are spending on reciprocal aid. Congress is suspicious and wemust help our friends in the Administration who have stood up to Congress. on this matter.11. I therefore propose that we should issue a White Paper (the material is already being prepared) which will describe the general principles of the pooling of resources illustrated by lend-lease and reciprocal aid. It willillustrate the range of the help we give and will give an estimate of globalvaluations for such services and assistance as can be valued. The White paper will distinguish between the reciprocal aid given to the U.S.A. and to theother United Nations, but it will set out what we give to others; our help toRussia, for example, is on a very substantial scale. I should have liked thestatement to cover&apos; the reciprocal aid given by the British Commonwealth as awhole. But there are difficulties in doing this in regard to the Dominionsand the statement will only, cover the reciprocal aid given by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom. I understand, however, thatMr. Stettinius proposes to bring together in the forthcoming Report to Congressfigures of the reciprocal aid given by all the Commonwealth. Hitherto we have asked the Dominions to refrain from giving figures of reciprocal aid because we.did not want the policy of comparisons to be entered upon; but if our policyis changed as I now propose, we shall have to encourage the Governments of theDominions and of India to give the Administration the data which they want,and to arrange that its production has, so far as possible, the same timing as ourown statement. -12. I propose to present the White Paper to Parliament next week. TheAdministration want it urgently and a proof copy will be flown over to the embassy, who will be able to give the necessary figures in confidence toMr. Stettinius. After it has been presented to Parliament it will be transmitted to Washington for more formal presentation to the Administration. ThePresident makes his Report on Lend-Eease to Congress, and it is therefore right that we should make our Report on Reciprocal Aid to Parliament.
II.--Raw Materials as Reciprocal Aid.13. Broadly, raw materials and foodstuffs supplied by the members of theBritish Commonwealth to the Government of the (United States are at presentoutside reciprocal aid. On the other hand, the United States supply us with rawmaterials and foodstuffs, both for the direct use of the Government and for theconsumption of the civil population. These supplies cover virtually the wholefield with, certain specific exceptions, of which the most important are tobacco(apart from tobacco for the troops), supplies to certain Crown Colonies which aresciieduled as being outside combat areas, and a number of smaller items which,for administrative reasons, it was not convenient to bring within the lend-leasemachine.14. The Administration urge that it is difficult to establish the doctrine of the pooling of resources unless more reciprocity is introduced into the situationand that the whole atmosphere will be changed if we can agree to supply certainraw materials and foodstuffs free. These would cover only the purchases of theUnited States Government and not purchases made through private tradechannels, even where these purchases are ultimately for the use of the, AmericanGovernment. Presumably this would include Shipping Services except whenthe United States Government ship the materials &quot;in their own vessels.15. Mr. Stettinius, of the Lend-Lease Administration, has communicated a quite provisional list of the raw materials and of their estimated value, whichis about  50 millions a year. The list does not purport to.be complete, andappears, on a rough examination, to contain a good many inaccuracies; but asit gives a general guide to the kind of raw materials which they want to get from the British Empire under reciprocal aid, I set out in Appendix I a tabledrawn from the American list, showing all the chief items which have been mentioned to us, together with an estimate of the rough distribution of the costfalling upon each of the supplying countries.16. Our own direct contribution of raw materials from this country is, ofcourse, negligible. The greater part must come from the Colonies, India, andthe Dominions. We cannot expect the Colonies to undertake this financial burden, and I should propose that in principle the United Kingdom lake thefinancial responsibility on their behalf, subject to further consideration between ,the Colonial Secretary and myself on any adjustments that may be reasonable in the case of Colonies which are themselves receiving lend-lease aid. I shouldbe prepared, to extend the acceptance of financial responsibility to the southern rhodesian contribution if their Government wishes it. I also propose that weshould assume the whole of the shipping costs involved.17. Australia and New Zealand have separate reciprocal aid agreements with the United States, and clearly the American Administration should beinvited to raise this question directly with each of these countries. Australia isalready giving reciprocal aid on a large scale owing to the number of american troops in the country, and it may be that this additional burden is more than she can support, at any rate if we continue to follow the line that only the mother-country incurs post-war liabilities, and that no other member of theCommonwealth can be expected to accept liabilities - which might cause their overseas financial position at the end of the war to be worse than at thebeginning. We already have an arrangement both With Australia and with NewZealand, by which we agree to lend them whatever is required to keep their sterling balances up to an agreed figure. The cost incurred by New Zealand wouldbe small. Australia would cease to earn a substantial amount of dollars and,under the Sterling Area arrangements mentioned in paragraph 29, hersterling balances in this country would be correspondingly reduced. Ifthey fell below the agreed figure, we should advance sterling to Australiaand she would then have a post-war liability to repay the sterling we advance.But this would in no way impair her power for carrying on the war. If,,in spite of this, either Australia or New Zealand were to find themselves inany immediate financial difficulties not covered by the existing guarantee tomaintain their sterling balances, we should no doubt be willing to considerrepresentations in due course, though I might say that quite recently I have givenDr. Evatt substantial financial help for the immediate budgetary difficulties ofhis Government.18. South Africa has not yet negotiated a reciprocal aid agreement withthe United States, and she gives no reciprocal aid to us. But I expect that[25766] f! ^ii^lilSS WMM^ B 2
South Africa would also wish to deal direct on the matter. There is no reason why we should accept any of their part of the burden, nor do I think that theywill wish us to do so. Financially speaking, the arrangements which they have pressed us to accept on political grounds have had the effect of enabling them toprofit from the war on a large scale; they have repatriated  80 millions of their sterling debt and. have increased their gold and sterling reserves by about 85 millions.;19. India is already giving some reciprocal aid to the United States, but has as yet no formal agreement because of some scruples over signing Article 7.I see no reason why the Exchequer should come to the aid of India on thisproposal. Indeed, it offers an opportunity for some slight improvement in thepresent position, by which India is profiting financially from the war on a scale which would surprise American opinion (I deal with India&apos;s position in more detail below). The dollars India would normally earn from the sales of these rawmaterials are, under the arrangements for the sterling area, turned over to us,and we credit India with a corresponding amount of sterling. The acceptance by India of this liability would mean a reduction by some  22 millions a year of the increase in India&apos;s swollen sterling balances. India has the advantageof lend-lease assistance on a considerable scale and cannot expect to escape somecorresponding liability for reciprocal aid. If the reciprocal aid given by theGovernment of India were, as a result of this change of policy, to exceedsubstantially the amount of lend-lease assistance received by that Government,it may be that we should be asked to provide sterling for the excess. If so, Iam prepared to consider that position when the time comes, in the light of thecircumstances. I should add that the Government of India is very anxiousto obtain very large supplies of silver from the United States. The Administra-tion are considering this urgently but are meeting with difficulties from some ofthe silver Senators. I have just received a personal telegram from the ambassador reporting that Mr. Morgenthau, although not wishing to associatethe provision of silver with the question of reciprocal aid, hinted, fairly broadlythat his-chances of success about the silver would be sensibly improved if thedecision about reciprocal aid were favourable.20. To settle the matter I propose that a telegram be sent to Washingtonsaying that the United Kingdom accepts the proposal that raw materialspurchased by the United States Government should be given as reciprocal aidso far as it relates to the raw materials shown in the list as being required fromthe United Kingdom, the Colonies and Southern Rhodesia, and also british shipping Services in respect of materials furnished under reciprocal aid fromany part of the Commonwealth. As regards Australia and New Zealand,South Africa and India, which are in direct contact with the United StatesGovernment lend-lease authorities and either have, or are negotiating, separatereciprocal aid agreements, we assume that the Administration will approach themdirect. The telegram would add that we are informing the Dominions as to ourown policy. At the same time we should send a corresponding telegram to theDominions and India explaining our action, so that they are in no doubt as towhat we hope they will do.In order to avoid complications in dealing with existing contracts I proposethat, subject to further detailed, examination by the Supply Departments, thegrant of reciprocal aid should apply to contracts made after the 1st October, 1943,and, in the case of a few existing long-term contracts, to deliveries under thosecontracts coming forward for shipment in the country of supply after that date.21. My colleagues may remember that our war-time export policy is affectedby the undertaking in the White Paper (Cmd. 6311) about the use of material in short supply, for export purposes. This undertaking has caused feeling among British traders and the Ambassador recently approached the state department to propose that it was now out of date and should be dropped. Ithink we can take it as certain from the most recent telegram on the subjectthat, if the policy about the gift of raw materials as reciprocal aid is acceptedby my colleagues,, the White Paper would, in practice, suffer a final and definitedisappearance.22.   There are two possible offsets to the concession on our part to supplyraw materials as reciprocal aid.   Before the latest Lend-Lease Appropriationwent to Congress tobacco for civilians was taken out of it.   Mr. Stettinius has&apos;suggested that, if we accept his proposal about raw materials, it may be practic-able tobacco to lend-lease, thus saving us $55 millions a year.  Secondly,&apos;
we. might hope that those Colonies which would be furnishing reciprocal aidunder the new agreement should no longer be excluded from full lend-leasefacilities on the ground that they are not &quot; in the combat area.&quot; We could not object if the Caribbean, which would be supplying insignificant amounts of reciprocal aid, were still excluded from full lend-lease facilities, since their position in relation to the United States is exceptional. But the African Colonies,who would henceforward be affording substantial reciprocal aid, would certainly have an increased and legitimate claim for full lend-lease facilities.III. Gold and Dollar Balances.23. Acceptance of the proposal about raw materials will have an effect upon our gold and dollar balances, and it is here that possible developments in theattitude of Congress to Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid might have significantconsequences for us.24. At the end of 1942 our net gold and dollar balances, that is, after deducting direct liabilities to repay in gold on demand, amounted to about 168 million, say, $700 million, of which  119 million were in gold, as comparedwith about  600 million at the outbreak of the war.25. At the end of 1943 it is expected that, if we do nothing, these netbalances may well have nearly doubled and the greater part of the increase coming in the second half of the year. An exact estimate is not easy because the rateof increase is greatly affected by the number of American troops in the sterling area.26. These gold and dollar balances will, however, be depleted to the extentof some  35 to  50 million, or possibly more, by the proposed scheme forthe sale of gold bullion as a commodity in the Middle East and India, in the hopethat it will operate as an anti-inflationary measure to mop up purchasing powerand to keep down the steady growth of increased prices in those countries.27. Their rate of increase will also be reduced by the whole amount of thevalue of raw materials supplied as Reciprocal Aid, whether given by us or byother members of the British Commonwealth, Le., by about  50 million a year. ,Owing to the arrangements by which dollars earned by any member of the sterling area are pooled in our hands, a loss of dollars by any member reduces- the amountof that pool.28. Against our existing balances we already have external liabilities ofabout eight times the amount, and these liabilities are growing currently byabout seven times the growth of the balances, and perhaps by as much as twelvetimes the growth of the balances if and when these balances are reduced by theabove measures. The liabilities to neutral countries included in this aggregate,though increasing rapidly, are not yet unmanageable, and by far the greater partof the unfunded liabilities are due to other parts of the sterling area, moreparticularly to India, Egypt and the rest of the Middle East.29. Under the Sterling Area arrangements all its members turn over to us .the dollars they earn in the United States. This pooling of the dollar incomeby the sterling area carries&apos; with it the corollary of an implied undertaking bythe U.K. to make dollars or other exchange available against sterling for anyproper and necessary purpose approved by the Exchange Control of any memberof the sterling area. In American eyes the gold and dollar balances are regardedas U.K. balances, but they are, in fact so far as the dollars are concerned, the consolidated resources of the whole of the sterling area, and the various members ofit, other than the U.K., are in a position, by virtue of their large holdings of sterling, to make large calls upon it at any time hereafter when they have a legitimate demand for dollars or other exchange.30. By far the largest item in the aggregate overseas liabilities of the U.K.is the growing debt to India. My colleagues are broadly aware of the positionalready (W.M. (42) 105, 125 and 129), but I take this opportunity to bring the.facts up to date. We are now spending in India at the rate of some  400 million a.year, of which by far the greater part we have to borrow from the Governmentof India; that is, they provide rupees for our expenditure in India against theprovision here of sterling. As a result of this arrangement the sterling balances of the Government of India, including those of the Reserve Bank, are expectedto have increased from about  58 million at the end of September 1939 to about
 745 million by the end of this year. This figure would have been larger had it not been for the repatriation by the Government of India of sterling securitiesheld in this country, to the value of  170 million, the bulk of which was effectedwith the aid of vesting orders in the U.K. By the end of this year, therefore, Ianticipate that India will have benefited financially, at our expense, by something like  850 million. How this situation is to be dealt with ultimately remains tobe seen. I do not propose at present to comment on the circumstances and arrange-ments which have led to the growth of these Indian sterling claims to such a figure,but they are an aspect of the financial picture which must be kept in mind in thepresent context.31. The second largest liability is in respect of the Middle East where our expenditure is running at the rate of about  200 million a year and is met by thelocal Governments providing local currency for local expenditure against sterlingheld in London. The sterling liabilities in the Middle East are swollen also by the inflation in those countries; we have to provide sterling to buy goods and services which stand at a very high price.32. We have also in prospect incalculable commitments in connection withthe East Asian Command.33. These global figures show that, even if the war were to end very shortly,we should start off in the peace with a vulnerable external position, withinadequate reserves and heavy sight liabilities. If the war goes on for long,our balance-sheet will progressively deteriorate and we cannot lightly accept any policy which might hasten that deterioration.34. While confidence in sterling after the war may well rest ultimatelyupon more imponderable factors such as the part we have played in the war, ourrenewed international prestige, and the desire of a number of countries,including important European Allies, to retain close relations with us for political as well as commercial reasons, we&apos; must obviously try to maintain a balance-sheet position which does not alarm our creditors. We need not be reluctant to go on accepting Lend-Lease aid from the United States in thetwilight before the dawn, and during the early transitional period after the war..But it will be of the utmost importance to us, if we are to regain full freedomof action, to become independent of such aid at as early a date as possible. Thereduction in current exchange earnings following upon the gift of raw materialsas reciprocal aid will make it all the mors necessary to maintain a reasonablereserve of gold and dollars. If we cannot do so, our freedom of action in economic policy after the war, particularly having regard to our immediate requirements in foreign exchange, may be seriously curtailed, and any anxiety about our basicfinancial position might affect the value. of the co-operation we can offer to america and the United Nations in the settlement of the post-war world..35. The American attitude to our gold and dollar balances changes fromtime to time. Sometimes, and in some Departments, they are willing to recognise the relation between the balances and the liabilities, but on other occasions,and particularly in the American Treasury, their comment is concentrated upon the apparent size of the balances without regard to the size of the liabilitiesagainst which they are held. This is not done in a hostile spirit; they representthat these liabilities are a post-war difficulty while Lend-Lease is directed to thewar, and that in any case the liabilities are largely &quot; within the family.&quot; the argument has been adduced that Lend-Lease was introduced to make it possiblefor countries to import what they require for the common effort against the aggressor, when, but only when, they were not able to pay for the imports. Theappearance of a large balance is said to excite the.suspicion of Congress that weare getting into a position in which we can be asked to pay.36. In fact a Cabinet Committee has recently been set up in Washington toconsider whether some ceiling should not be put to the growth of our balances,and a figure of  250 million has been suggested. So far we have been entirelyunwilling to accept any Plimsoll line above which our balances can be held tobe excessive. We have also declined hitherto to accept any kind of formula forrelating the growth of the balances to the growth of the liabilities. Indeed,whatever formula might be adopted about the rate of growth, the general relation of the balances to the liabilities would remain much too low.37. Moreover it is most unreasonable that we alone should be pursued onthis matter when all the other Allies are left unchastened. Russia&apos;s gold reserves are believed to be nearly double ours, with no liabilities against them.   France&apos;s
stock of gold and dollar balances is about three times ours, as they have not had todeplete it for war expenditure since their collapse. Belgium&apos;s reserves&apos; arenearly as great as ours, and Holland&apos;s not far short. Even Norway has nearly half as much, if we reckon in her sterling. None of these countries have overseasliabilities against their reserves, whereas, for example, we owe Norway alone,as a result of paying for her ships, an amount equal to one-quarter of our totalreserves. If the United States themselves were to pay off the whole of their foreign liability they would still hold a gold reserve 23 times our total holdings of gold and dollars. It is absurd that we alone should be expected to incur an ever-increasing debt with nothing in hand against it. As things are we shall bethe only belligerent which will emerge from the war, victorious, but with the lossof all our most marketable overseas investments and with enormous overseasliabilities. Since the outbreak of war we have parted with  2,500 million ofgold, foreign investments and claims against us, and more than 90 per cent, of thiswill have been handed out not to neutrals but to other members of the united nations.Appendix II contains a fuller statement of our position and of the way inwhich it has developed.38. Unfortunately this is a matter upon which the Administration can give us no guarantee, for although they may be quite willing to leave matters to take their course, they cannot guarantee that Congress may not fasten upon the problem,of the balances, especially if their appetite were whetted by the presentation of statistical figures of reciprocal aid. which they would regard as too small torepresent all that we can do. The temptation would be to put pressure upon theAdministration to reduce the amount of Lend-Lease coming to us, and indeed it was for this reason among others that tobacco was taken out of Lend-Leaseearlier in the year.39. If my colleagues agree with the proposals about the gift of raw materials and about the presentation of a White Paper on reciprocal aid, I think weshould take the opportunity to put it on record that w^e regard the state of our gold and dollar balances as not open to criticism in the light of the situation asa whole, and that we are regarding this problem as one which will not be raisedby the Administration in the near future. For this purpose it will, I think, benecessary to present to the various branches of the Administration a note setting out the problem in more detail. It is one of our difficulties in this matter thatwhile Lend-Lease questions as a whole are handled by the State Department,it is the Treasury who take particular interest in the gold and dollar balances,and wre must make sure that the State Department, the Lend-Lease Adminis-tration, and the Treasury, are all in possession of our whole case, on our external financial position. A convenient form of such a paper would be a summary of theproposals and conclusions discussed in this memorandum, together with the state-ment in Appendix II.40. It will be seen from what I have said, that the essence of our financial problem and the main preoccupation concerning our financial future arises out ofour vast uncovered, expenditures in the Middle East and in India. By lend-lease and the generosity of the Canadian Government we are now liberally caredfor in North America. In other parts of the world our expenditures, whileheavy, are not hopelessly out of proportion to our remaining resources. Butwe must sooner or later adopt a new policy towards the growth of our indebted-ness in India and the Middle East. I have therefore considered an alternative method of approach to the United States Administration on the basis of theirtaking a share in our cash outgoings in these areas, and particularly that theyshould look after the local expenditure in cash which may fall upon the EastAsian Command. The President cannot fairly claim that there has been in anytrue sense a pooling of resources until overseas expenditure, which has to bemade in local currencies, has been pooled as well as the physical supplies whichcan be carried -there in ships. A time may well come when we have to raise thismatter with the United States. I should welcome the advice of my colleagueswhether the present opportunity should be taken for pointing out how incompleteis the application of the principle of pooling when it applies only to physicalsupplies and not to cash expenditure overseas. But I am not myself clear thatit would be wise to take any initiative on these lines in connection with the present negotiations. The issues are not only financial, for obviously the financialintervention of the United States in India and the Middle East would raiseserious political issues. Moreover, the fundamental principle of lend-lease, in american eyes at any rate, is that it is a gift to the United Nations of what can
be produced in American territory. There is nothing that I am aware ofcontrary to American practice in America&apos;s bearing an appropriate share of cashoutgoings incurred by combined operations outside the United States. But this could not conveniently take the form of an extension of lend-lease and is, there-fore, perhaps not entirely relevant in the context of the present discussion.41. But, whether now or later is the time, I should not like my colleagues tobe in any doubt about the anxiety that I feel over the present position and itsdevelopments.42.   To sum up, I propose (i) To meet the claim for statistics of Reciprocal Aid by the production of a white Paper on the lines indicated in paragraph 11 above.(ii) To accept on behalf of the U.K. that the raw materials from the U.K.,the Colonies and Rhodesia should be given as Reciprocal Aid, and toindicate to the Ambassador that the United States administration should be invited to discuss this proposal with Australia, NewZealand, India and South Africa, who should be informed of our policy. British Shipping Services for the carriage of these materials from all parts of the Commonwealth would be given as reciprocal aid.(iii) That we should put on record with the Administration our view that,having regard to our agreement on (i) and (ii), we consider that.thequestion of our gold and dollar balances could stand over to a muchlater time. We shall in anycase be reducing the rate of their increasesubstantially by our proposals in regard to the shipping of gold to theMiddle East and by the loss of the dollars that will come by the gift of- raw materials as Reciprocal Aid. We will present them with a full statement, which will offer convincing proof that, there is nothing to criticise in the present arrangements; on the contrary, these figures will indicate the heavy and disproportionate share of overseas,liabilities which we are shouldering. This statement will, of course,,be for their confidential information. *K.

But they have not muchlightened the financial burden outside North America, partly for purchases else-where which cannot be paid for by current exports, and particularly as a result ofthe burden of local cash expenditures in the principal areas of hostilities from north Africa through the Middle East to India and the Far East. The following is an attempt to give a complete picture, for the confidential information of theAmerican Administration, covering the whole period since the 1st January, 1940.The excess of the financial burden overseas beyond what could be met out of current income in the last 3  years has been met in four ways, as follows :-
It will be observed that the gold and dollar reserves whilst they have decreased by two-thirds over the period as a whole, have been increasingmoderately in 1942 and subsequently. Moreover, they are likely to increase more rapidly, ror reasons which are- explained below, in the latter half of 1943.Since this movement has produced a misleading impression that the UnitedKingdom5s financial position has been improving, it is important to present thefacts in their right perspective :   ,(a) The most important consideration is the relation between the liquidassets and the liquid liabilities. It will be seen that, taking the war period as a whole, the net gold and dollar reserves have fallen by more than a billionand a half dollars, whilst the liquid, unfunded liabilities have risen by fivebillion dollars. It is true that, taking the more recent period since the31st December, 1941, the net gold and dollar reserves have risen by $322 million.But the liquid liabilities have risen during the same period by $1,728 million.Thus, the gain in gold and dollars had been offset five-fold bv the increase inliquid liabilities. To a large extent, moreover (for reasons to be explained in(b) and (c) below) the increased reserves have been acquired only at the costof a directly consequential increase in the liquid liabilities, and therefore donot constitute hew resources.(b) The liabilities are liabilities solely of the United Kingdom withoutsupport from any other part of the sterling area. But the liquid assets cannotbe regarded as wholly available for the United Kingdom&apos;s requirements. Fora large part of them has been acquired under the pooling arrangements, bywhich any part of the sterling area which earns a surplus in dollars over its current requirements in dollars lends this surplus to the United Kingdom forsterling. This increases the United Kingdom&apos;s liquid dollar assets, but at thesame time increases by the same amount the liquid sterling liabilities of theUnited Kingdom, which it has an implied obligation to turn back again into dollarswhen other parts of the sterling area have a legitimate need for them. The way in which-this operated during the first quarter of 1943 is illustrated in detailbelow.(c) The liquid liabilities are the more burdensome because of the disposalof many of the more saleable capital assets, which otherwise would have servedas a second line of defence. As the table above shows, the total loss of assets and increase of liabilities suffered by the United Kingdom during the war hasamounted to ten and a half billion dollars. It may be mentioned that only avery small portion of this has been disposed of to neutrals. More than 90 percent, of this loss has been to the advantage of other members of the united nations. The United Kingdom alone has been expected to mortgage the futureon a large scale by incurring overseas liabilities. During the earlier periodof the war, expenditure in North America was the main cause of the deterioration of the United Kingdom&apos;s financial position. More recently her responsibilityfor meeting the greater part of the local cash expenditures in the w7hole areaof hostilities from Tunis to Burma has been the main influence. At the presenttime the United Kingdom&apos;s local cash expenditure in Egypt, the Middle Eastand India, over and above the supplies shipped across the seas, is amountingto some $2  billions annually, the greater part of which has to be borrowedfrom the countries concerned.In the case of India, for example, it is estimated that we shall by the end ofthis year have enriched her since the beginning of the war by $3,400 million, ofwhich $680 million will have been used to discharge her Government sterlingdebt and the balance will remain owing to her.(d) In judging whether, in spite of the above considerations, the United King-dom is nevertheless accumulating unnecessarily large liquid reserves at someoneelse&apos;s expense, it is relevant to consider the relationship between the United King-dom&apos;s resources as shown above and those of other members of the United Nations.For example, the gold and dollar reserves of the U.S.S.R., which are not published,are estimated by the United States Treasury at $1,600 million and those ofChina at $750 million. United States official estimates put the corresponding figures of France at $2,875 million, of the Netherlands at $690 million andBelgium at $870 million. None of these countries have any significant amount of overseas liquid liabilities against these reserves. The figures for the UnitedKingdom (which in respect of dollars includes the whole of the sterling area) are,as shown above, $811 million (a little more than China, and a little less thanBelgium), with eight times this amount of liabilities against them.   The net. gold
reserves^ of the United States are about twenty-three times those of the UnitedKingdom.! - :(e) A detailed analysis of the causes of the growth of the British gold and dollar balances in the first quarter of 1943 may help to elucidate the position.$167 million in gold was obtained from South Africa in payment for there patriation of South African Government sterling securities held in London.This, therefore, represented no gain of assets, but an exchange. A further$39 million of South African gold was acquired at the cost of increasing south africans sterling balances by this amount, so that this was acquired by anincrease of liabilities. The rest of the sterling area outside the United Kingdomearned a dollar surplus of $25 million, and a further $64 million in respect of american troops, both of which amounts were sold to the United Kingdom forsterling balances; so that this also led to an increase of liabilities. $9 million was realised from security sales and the like in the United States, so that thisagain represented an exchange of assets. These items, none of which represented a net increment of assets to the United Kingdom, add up to $304 million. Thenet growth of British gold and dollar balances during the same period amounted,however, to no more than $119 million. It follows that the British current account in gold and dollars was overspent by $185 million, and the apparentimprovement of $119 million was only achieved by a directly consequentialdeterioration of $304 million on the other side of the account.It would, of course, have been possible to avoid the apparent, misleadingimprovement.of $119 million by not incurring some of the above liabilities or by using the increment to wipe off other liabilities. But clearly this would haveweakened the position as a whole. Not all the liquid liabilities will prove equallypressing hereafter. But it is very difficult to select beforehand the most pressingof them for immediate discharge. Thus the British position is somewhat stronger than it would be if both assets and liabilities were to be reduced by $119 million;and it is not obvious that there would be any sufficient countervailing advantage to make this course advisable. Moreover, a new system might lead to a loss of reserves appreciably larger than the $119 million in question.In the light of these figures the British Government ask the United states administration to agree with them that the present arrangements are not opento criticism; and that it cannot fairly be represented by anyone acquainted with -the complete facts, that the growth of balances represents a net improvement ofthe British position which justifies a call upon her to undertake a larger shareof the common financial burden than at present. Furthermore, this will remaintrue if the increased expenditure on account of American troops in the sterling-area leads to some further growth (as we expect it will) in the ensuing months.For there will be a further, much larger growth of liabilities during the sameperiod; and even if there were not, an increased total of reserves is urgently needed to meet the requirements of the already existing situation. The United kingdom has already handed over about 9 billion of gold assets and claims to her friends and Allies for the help they have afforded to the common cause.* I.e., after deducting all foreign balances held in United States.f I.e., after deducting only those foreign balances held in United Kingdom which carry agold or dollar guarantee.
