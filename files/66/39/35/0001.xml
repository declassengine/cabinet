Coastal and Fighter Commands for night mine-laying, patrol (under shore control) and bombing attacks on enemy &quot; E &quot; boats and shipping in the Channel area.On nine occasions ships or &quot; E &quot; boats were detected, and bombed resulting in the probable sinking of five &quot; E &quot; boats and damage to. two others and alarger vessel. On another occasion three groups totalling about 15 &quot; E &quot; boats were detected and reported. Light coastal forces intercepted and engagedresulting -in the sinking of two &quot; E &quot; boats and damage to four others by gunfire.The Albacores also carried out a diversion in connection with a successful attack by M.T.Bs.   One Albacore and four Swordfish reported missing.Eastern Mediterranean.Two squadrons, totalling six Walrus and twelve Swordfish, employed inA/S patrol and convoy escort duties.One squadron of fighters employed on shipping protection duties and with-drawn end of February.Malta.Two squadrons, totalling eighteen Albacores employed in night search andtorpedo attack on enemy transport and supply ships in co-operation with unitsof the R.A.F.On six occasions small convoys were attacked with torpedoes resulting in the sinking or probable sinking of two ships (about 9,000 tons) and serious damage to six others (about 26,000 tons). Mines were also laid off the coast of Tunis.On many other nights armed searches were carried out for enemy shipping but without success partly owing to A.S.V. jamming. Three Albacores reported missing.Tunisia.On the 14th March four Albacores were detached from Malta (from one ofthe squadrons employed for many months with the R.A.F. and 8th Army inEgypt) for temporary duty in Libya and latterly in Tunisia. These aircraft were employed in providing flare illumination for night raids by bombers of theR.A.F. on enemy-occupied airfields and concentrations of M.T., also for independent raids on various objectives in Tunisia.Algeria.One squadron of twelve Albacores stationed at Blida with forward operatingbase at Bone (from the 24th February) for night search and patrol and attacks on enemy shipping.Two ships attacked, one of which of about 4,000 tons, was damaged. no details of other activities reported.   Three Albacores missing.
Algeria and Gibraltar.Two squadrons, totalling twelve Swordfish and five Walrus, employed in A / Spatrol and convoy escort duties.Note. The above shore-based squadrons are gradually being withdrawn to equip the new escort carriers coining into service.Appendix.For purposes of record the Appendix to this paper gives a summary of the major incidents in the work of the Fleet Air Arm since their highly successful attack oh the Italian Fleet at Taranto in November 1940.&quot;A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1,22nd July, 1943.APPENDIX I.Major incidents in the work, of the Fleet Air Arm since the attack on theItalian Fleet at Taranto, November 1940.I. The operations on the Dalmatian coast from Greece, where between16 and 20 ships were torpedoed by Swordfish aircraft (April-May 1941).2.   The Syrian campaign, where 3 enemy ships were sunk (June 1941).3. Matapan, where Formidable^ aircraft not only provided invaluablereconnaissance, but reduced the speed of the Vittorio Veneto to 13 knots andimmobilised the cruiser Pola with torpedoes, thus leading to the annihilation of3 cruisers by the gunfire of the Fleet after dark (March 1941).4. The Fleet bombardments at Genoa (February 1941) and Tripoli (April1941) relying almost entirely on Fleet Air Arm spotting, coupled withdiversionary raids (F.A.A.) on objectives in the vicinity.5. The bombardments at Bardia (December 1940 et seq.) and the many latercoastal day and night bombardments through 1941-42 in support of the Army,relying almost entirely on F.A.A. spotting.6. The night raid and minelaying at Mogadishu by Formidable&apos;s aircraft(February 1941) and later attacks on enemy destroyers and U-boats at Massawa(February-March 1941).7. The attack on the San Chiara dam, Sardinia, by Ark Royal&apos;s aircraft(February 1941) and raids on enemy harbours, aerodromes, &amp;c, in the eastern mediterranean (1941).8. The rounding up and destruction of the last remaining enemy destroyers in the Red Sea by Eagle&apos;s aircraft (March 1941).9. The series of attacks on barracks and other objectives in Iraq byHermes&apos;s aircraft during the Military rising (May 1941).10. The sinking of the Bismarck, which I think it is fair to say was onlymade possible by the attacks by aircraft of the Victorious and Ark Royal(May 1941).II. The daylight attack on Petsamo and Kirkenes by aircraft fromVictorious and Furious (July 1941), followed by raids on shipping and other objectives in Norway (August, September, October 1941).12. The destruction of Focke Wulfs by, the fighters of Audacity and the fighter catapult ships (July 1941 et seq.).13. The attack by 6 Swordfish on Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugenin the Channel (February 1942).14.   The attack on Madagascar, where the Fleet Air Arm were responsiblefor sinking 2 submarines, 1 sloop, 1 Armed Merchant Cruiser and 1 other ship,[25806] - b 2
and for close support to the Army in trench strafing and in shooting down theonly 3 bombers and 6 fighters which endeavoured to interfere with them(May 1942).15. Operation &quot; Pedestal,&quot; where the Indomitable, Victorious and Eaglewere responsible for shooting down 39 enemy aircraft (September 1942), also some half dozen or more similar but smaller-scale operations in the western mediterranean (1941-42) and the N. Russia Convoy (September 1942).16. The Operations in connection with the landing in North Africa whichdepended on the Fleet Air Arm for air support, and where the Fleet Air Armalone were responsible for the destruction of some 60 aircraft on the ground orin air combat, and the rapid capture of enemy airfields : notably the capture ofBlida airfield by a Martlet pilot.17. The continual work with the 8th Army of Albacores, pathfinding and providing illumination for the bombing of enemy key positions and transport,since the spring of 1941, through El Aiamein to the present day.18. Both at Gibraltar and on the Tobruk run, a number of successful attacks against submarines.19. Fleet Air Arm aircraft at Malta, who are now responsible for sinking39 and damaging with torpedoes at least another 50 enemy ships.20. Minelaying and offensive operations by Naval aircraft in the Channelarea, resulting in the destruction of, or damage to, 2 or 3 ships and several &quot; E &quot;or &quot; R &quot; boats, and work in co-operation with the light coastal forces.21. Since Taranto British aircraft carriers have&apos; reinforced Malta with616 Hurricanes and Spitfires, also West Africa (for the Middle East) with 114,North Russia with 24, Batavia (for Singapore) with 50 and Colombo with 60Hurricanes.   Total 864 fighter reinforcements.APPENDIX   II.Naval aircraft ivritten off charge, reported during the period 1st February-30th April, 1943.---	First Line.		Training.		T.B.R.	S.S.F.	T.B.R.
