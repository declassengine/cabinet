COMBINED OPERATIONS.1. A party of two officers and eight other ranks was landed from a M.T.B.near Biville-sur-Mer (between Dieppe and Le Treport) at 0205 on the 6th July.They attempted to scale the cliffs with a view to intercepting a German patrolon the top. A tangle of barbed wire near the &quot;top of the cliffs proved impassableand the party re-embarked.NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.2. U.S. naval forces covering landing operations in the Solomons havedecisively defeated a Japanese force of cruisers and destroyers. At least nineenemy ships were sunk.Shipping casualties, due to widely-dispersed U-boat attacks, have been considerably higher than in recent weeks. .One German U-boat has been probably sunk, three probably damaged andone possibly damaged.  One Japanese U-boat has probably been sunk.Home Waters.3. Two enemy destroyers, which were proceeding down Channel from dunkirk on the night of the 4th/5th, were attacked by three M.T.Bs. under cover of the fire of Dover coastal batteries. On the 6th, they were attacked in Boulogneharbour by Typhoon bombers; one destroyer was probably damaged. On the 7th,a further attack was made by a naval Albacore south of Boulogne.Mediterranean.4.   On the night of the 29th/30th, coastal craft from Malta bombarded the village of Marina D&apos;Avola on the east coast of Sicily.H.M. S/M Osiris sank a caique in the southern ^aegean on the 27thH.M. S/M Sportsman sank a 2,000-ton ship while on patrol in the Gulf of Genoa.The R.F.A:-Oligarch, in east-bound convoy, was torpedoed west of Derna onthe 1st and was towed into port.Black Sea.5. Russian submarines sank two landing barges off the Crimean coast onthe 21st and torpedoed a ship off the coast of Turkey-in-Europe on the 25th.Russian light craft and shore batteries sank one light craft and damaged another in the Sea of Azov.South-West PaciSc.6.   U.S. naval forces have covered and supported the landing operations inthe Solomons and on New Guinea.On the 30th, U.S. cruisers and destroyers bombarded Japanese positions inthe Bougainville Straits area and laid mines in the approaches to ShortlandIsland. Two destroyers also shelled Vila airfield on Kolombangara Island (N.W.of New Georgia). On the 3rd, the enemy naval force; then consisting of threelight cruisers and about four destroyers, shelled U.S. positions on Rendova andexchanged fire with U.S. ships before retiring. On the same day two U.S.destroyers shelled positions at Wickham Anchorage, south-east of VangunuIsland (S.E. of New Georgia). U.S. naval casualties at this stage of the operations \consisted of the transport McCawley (7,700 tons), bombed and subsequently &apos;torpedoed and sunk by U-boat,-the destroyer Gwinn, damaged by shore batteriesat Munda (W. of New Georgia), and the destroyer Zane, taken in tow afterstranding. On the night of the 4th/5th, the destroyer Strong was torpedoed and sunk by U-boat.7. During the night of the 5th/6th, Allied ships intercepted an enemy forceof cruisers and destroyers in the -Kula. Gulf (between New Georgia andKolombangara). Four or five destroyers were hit by broadsides from U.S. ships and all either sunk or set on fire. Three, possibly four, enemy cruisers were thenengaged and sunk or set on fire; one being beached.  It is estimated that at least
nine enemy ships were sunk. The U.S. 8&quot; cruiser Helena was sunk during theaction. Subsequently, U.S. destroyers intercepted and sank two Japanese ships which were attempting to escape from the Gulf, and damaged a third.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. Nineteen attacks on German U-boats have been reported during the week;fourteen by aircraft and five by surface craft. One of the attacks was made inthe Mediterranean.On the 3rd a Liberator (B. 24) probably sank a U-boat in the Bay of Biscay.Other German U-boats were probably damaged in the Biscay area byH.M.S. Havelock (destroyer) and by a Liberator (B. 24), and by an. aircraft north-east of Newfoundland. A Japanese&apos; U-boat was probably sunk by the U.S.Destroyer Radford during the operations in the Solomons.Enemy Intelligence.German.9. A German warship, probably the lutzow, was sighted on the 6th, escorted by aircraft, off the north coast of Norway on a southerly course.Japanese.10. Japanese forces in the Solomons area do not appear to have been reinforced except for a few cruisers and destroyers which may have been sent from Truk or from Home Waters, where the main strength is believed to be stillconcentrated.Two of the four converted aircraft carriers which Were recently in the SouthPacific are now in Home Waters.U-boats.11. It is estimated that there are more than 100 U-boats now at sea inthe Atlantic. Of this number, six are off the south-east coast of Africa and in theMadagascar area, where there has been renewed activity.Since the 1st January, photographs show that the rate of U-boat constructionhas been maintained and that it is continually being increased.U-boats under destroyer and air escort were sighted by aircraft north of cape Ortegal on the 1st, steering east.Enemy Attack on Shipping.12. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked 18 ships, ofwhich eight are known to have sunk.A U.S. tanker was sunk off the American Atlantic coast paid two ships were sunk in the Caribbean. Off the Brazilian coast, four U.S. ships, including twotankers, were torpedoed in a northbound convoy north of Natal, a Brazilian ship was sunk off Belem and a U.S. ship was sunk off Santos. One ship was torpedoedsouth-west of Freetown.. In the Mediterranean, two ships, in an eastbound convoy were sunk off Tenez,and one ship was torpedoed north-east of Benghazi.Two ships, of which one was sunk, were torpedoed and one shelled south-west of Madagascar. One U.S. ship was torpedoed in the Gulf of Oman and another was attacked west of Australia.Enemy Merchant Shipping.13. The German tanker Wilhelmsburg in company with the German GerdaToft (1,960 tons) passed Istanbul on the 6th for the ^Egeah.As the result of the bombing of U-boat bases and the destruction of the ship-building yards at St. jNazaire, Nantes has become increasingly important amongstBiscay ports. The latest air photographs show that about 160,300 tons ofshipping was in the port, the largest assembly of merchant shipping in any Frenchport except Marseilles.  A floating dock 490 feet long has arrived from Brest.14. During the period the 1st/15th June, eight enemy ships totalling29,380 tons were sunk and five ships totalling 13,900 tons were seriously damaged.Of these, five ships (15,200 tons) were sunk and three ships (5,600 tons) wTeredamaged in the Mediterranean.[25714] b 2
-Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. During the week ending the 4th, 969 ships were convoyed. Of these,253 were in ocean convoys and 716 in British coastal convoys. Sixty-fivedestroyers (including nine U.S. destroyers), 113 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes (including six U.S. cutters and covettes), one merchant aircraft-carrier,four escort-carriers and one ocean boarding vessel were employed on escort duties.Three ocean convoys, consisting of 132 ships, arrived in Home Waters duringthe week without loss.16. During the week ending the 3rd, imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 1,251,000 tons compared with 890,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 864,000 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 502,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.British Minelaying.17. During the week mines were laid by surface craft off the Dutch coast and by aircraft off the Frisian Islands and in the Bay of Biscay. Mines were also laid in the eastern Mediterranean.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.18. Minelaying by aircraft may possibly have taken place in daylight on one occasion during the week. There have been no reports of minelaying by surface craft.Twenty-five mines have been destroyed off the South-West coast and threeoff the south coast of Ireland (R). In the Mediterranean, dangerous areas havebeen declared off the south-west coast of Sardinia and the west coast of Sicily.The mine totals are : 4,402 ground and 2,999 moored.Russian Intelligence.19. The battleship Parizhskaya Kommuna has reverted to her original name,Sevastopol.vichy French Intelligence.20. Admiral Robert, the Governor of Martinique and Guadeloupe, requested the U.S. Government on the 30th to appoint a plenipotentiary to discuss thetransfer of authority in the French Antilles. Warships at Fort de Franceinclude the aircraft-carrier Beam and the 6&quot; cruiser Emile Bertin, both ofwhich are partially immobilised. Photographic reconnaissance on the 20th Mayshowed that the Beam was aground. Merchant shipping in the French Antillesincludes eight tankers and is believed to total over 80,000 tons.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.21. The Russians have announced that on the morning of the 5th theGermans opened an offensive in the Orel-Kursk and Byelgorod areas, usingstrong armoured and infantry forces with powerful air support. They admit that the Germans have captured two unspecified places-in the Byelgorod area, butclaim that otherwise all the attacks have been repulsed with very heavy losses.The German version of the recent activity is that on the 5th a successful localattack by German infantry in the Byelgorod area was followed by strong Russiancounter-attacks, and that heavy fighting then spread to the area north of Kursk.Although there is no doubt that the fighting in the last few days has beenheavy, it is not yet clear whether it is in fact the beginning of a German offensive on a considerable scale. If so, the immediate object is presumably to reduce theRussian salient in the Kursk sector.The Germans claim that on the 6th heavy Russian attacks south of Orel, andin the Byelgorod area had failed. It was further claimed that a German attack had penetrated deep into Russian positions.The Russian communique states that during the 7th the enemy continued the offensive with large tank, infantry and air forces. It stated that in the Byelgorodsector the enemy advanced somewhat suffering heavy losses, but claimed that in theOrel-Kursk sectors all the heavy attacks were unsuccessful.
Burma.22. The only activity during the week has been minor patrolling in theChin Hills and Sumprabum areas.South-West Pacific.Solomon Islands.23. U.S. forces completed their occupation of Pendova Island within eight hours of their landing on the 30th June, Thirty-five of the Japanese garrison of 75 were killed.A second U.S. force landed at Viru Harbour on the south-east of New Georgia40 miles from Munda airfield on the 30th, and captured the harbour after meeting with opposition.   Fighting is still in progress in the area.Further landings were made on the 3rd on New Georgia eight miles south-east of Munda and at Wickham Harbour on Vangunu Island to the south-east of NewGeorgia. The Japanese on Vangunu have been driven into the north-west corner of the Island.On the night 4th/5th, a landing was made at Pice Anchorage half-way along the north-west coast of New Georgia in the Kula Gulf. A further landing wasmade east of Munda.New Guinea.24. The Australians moving east from Mubo joined hands on the 2nd withthe U.S. forces who landed on the 30th at Nassau Bay ten miles south of Salamaua.The southern bank of the lower arm of the Bitoi River, which flows into NassauBay, has been cleared of the enemy.AIR SITUATION.General Review.25. Bomber Command aircraft made a heavy night attack on industrial areas in Cologne and Fortresses (B. 17) made a daylight attack on targets inFrance.Heavy attacks were made on Sicilian airfields and on targets in SouthernItaly and Sardinia.Allied aircraft gave full support to the landings in the Soiomons and new guinea.United Kingdom.26.

The attack on La Pallice was described as &quot; fair to good,&quot; and the resultsof the other attacks are given in Appendix VI. During these operations theFortresses (B. 17) destroyed 53 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 15 and damaged 22.  Spitfires, which provided withdrawal cover, destroyed a further two.Twelve escorted Mitchells (B. 25) successfully attacked Amiens railway centre.  Two enemy aircraft were shot down and four Spitfires are missing.Light and fighter-bombers attacked railway and other targets in northern france, Belgium arid Holland. One locomotive was destroyed and 22 others were damaged, and four oil storage cisterns were destroyed or seriously damaged. Anattack was also made on shipping at Havre but results were not observed. TwoMustangs (P. 51) are missing.Fighter sweeps resulted in the destruction of 16 enemy aircraft for the lossof one Allied fighter.Night.29. On the night 3rd/4th, 653 aircraft of Bomber Command were despatched to attack Cologne, the main objectives being the important industrial areas of Deutz and Kalk on the east bank of the river; 589 aircraft attacked,dropping 1,878 tons of bombs.The marker bombs were dropped punctually and accurately and wereconsistently maintained, enabling the Main Force to deliver a very successful attack. Fires developed rapidly on both sides of the river until a large area wasablaze with dense clouds of smoke rising to a great height. A preliminary examination of photographs taken on the 4th indicates extensive damage (seeAppendix VI). Thirty bombers are missing and two enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat.Mosquitoes made small-scale attacks on Cologne, Duisburg, Hamburg andDusseldorf.Intruders attacked airfields and railway targets in Northern France and theLow Countries.  Leaflets were dropped on Paris, Lille and other French towns.Mediterranean.Italy and Sicily.30. Continuous and intensive attacks were made on targets in Sicily and southern Italy with a concentration of effort against Sicilian airfields.Some of the heaviest raids were made on Gerbini airfield and its satellitelanding grounds. On three consecutive days or nights eight major attacks were carried out on these targets by a total of over 500 heavy and medium bombers.Other Sicilian airfields heavily bombed on three or more occasions wereTrapani/Milo, Sciacca, Biscari and Comiso. A force of 100 Liberators (B. 24)attacked airfields in the heel of Italy at Lecce, Grottaglie and San Pancrazio.Other airfields raided were Palermo/Bocca Di Falco, Borizzo and Casteivetrano.On the 4th and 5th, enemy fighter opposition was unusually intense and strongformations reacted strongly to our widespread operations. One formation of100 Fortresses (B. 17) bombing Gerbini was attacked by nearly 100 enemy fighters,30 of which they destroyed for the loss of three bombers. Other enemy formationsencountered varied from 20 to 75 aircraft consisting mostly of F.W. 190s andMe. 109s. During one raid enemy fighters released a cluster of incendiary bombswhich brought down one Fortress (B. 17) and damaged 12 others. Spitfires from malta flew over 800 sorties as escort to U.S. bombers.. In all, during these operations, over 100 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of 25 Alliedbombers and 17 fighters.Messina was bombed at night by 62 Wellingtons and in daylight by83 Liberators (B. 24); considerable damage was caused to harbour installations and other property and a hit was obtained on a ship. Fortresses (B. 17) by day and Wellingtons by night also successfully attacked the town arid railway centre at Palermo.Sardinia.31. Wellingtons made three night attacks on Cagliari, dropping over150 tons of bombs, which caused fires in the town and in the dock and railwayareas; a further 100 tons were released on Olbia and the arsenal was believed to have been hit.Fortresses (B. 17) and medium bombers made heavy attacks on the airfields at Ozieri/Chilivani, Cagliari /Monserrato, Aighero, Milis and Capoterra.  Bombs
fell in the target areas, buildings were hit and many fires were reported. Someenemy opposition was encountered and six enemy fighters were shot down forthe loss of four Allied bombers and one fighter. Over 20 war hawks (P. 40F)attacked a radio station at Pula (12 miles S.S.W. of Cagliari).North-West Africa and Pantelleria.32. About 20 enemy fighter-bombers made a dusk attack on Pantelieriaharbour and met with some measure of success. Bombs fell on the port and onthe airfield, where five aircraft were damaged; two of the attacking aircraft were destroyed.Defensive patrols shot down two Ju. 88s off Bizerta and four enemy fightersN.E. of Cape Bon. A night attack by 50 enemy aircraft on Bizerta resulted insome casualties and the destruction of barracks, huts and M.T. Four enemy bombers (three by A.A. guns), were destroyed.Battle Casualties and Sorties.33. During the week ended the 6th July, 144 enemy aircraft were shot down;49 Allied aircraft are missing.  A total of 6,685 sorties were flown.Russia.34. The Russians continued their night bombing operations on railwayjunctions, and ports on both sides of the Kerch Straits. Apart from this, activityover the whole front up to the 4th July was extremely small. The german offensive on the 5th, in the areas of Orel, Kersk and Byelgorod, howrever, involved the Soviet Air Force in heavy defensive operations, particulars of which arenot yet available.Prior to the offensive, the German Air Force activity appeared to have been on a small scale. It is estimated that the G.A.F. could concentrate some 800-1,000aircraft, representing perhaps 40-50 per cent, of the total force available onthe Russian front, in support of their ground forces. The strategical long-rangebombing of industrial targets, which became a feature of G.A.F. policy, appearedto have ceased a week ago, supporting the view that its object was to reduce theRussian war potential as a preliminary to any German offensive action..Burma.35. Allied air activity, though hampered by the monsoon, was intensive andone of the principal targets was the enemy&apos;s rail and river transport.Successful attacks were made on railway targets in the Mandalay area andin Lower Burma; 30 tons of bombs were dropped on the Myitnge bridge causingextensive damage to the bridge and its approaches.Enemy shipping on the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers and in the Akyabarea was continuously attacked. On the 2nd, Beaufighters damaged a steamer and about 80 sampans near Pakokku (84 miles S.W. of Mandaiay).Among other targets successfully attacked were the Syriam oil refinery nearRangoon and oil-installations and two factories on Ramree Island.No Japanese air activity has been reported.Pacific Zone.        .Solomon Islands.36. In preparation for the Allied landings on Rendova Island and NewTGeorgia heavy bombing attacks were made on airfields, barracks, gun positions and ammunition dumps at Munda in New Georgia&quot; and Vila on KolombangaraIsland (N.W. of New Georgia).On the 30th June,- when the landings were made, and on subsequent days,Allied aircraft maintained their heavy attacks on Munda and Vila and on other targets in the Solomons.The Japanese made several air attacks on the landing-places, but the enemy&apos;slosses were heavy; by the 3rd July, 134 enemy bombers and fighters were shot down for the loss of only 31 Allied aircraft.New Guinea.37. Allied aircraft gave full support to the forces which landed at NassauBay on the 30th. Heavy attacks were made on Lae airfield and on enemy positions in the Salamaoa, Mubo and Lae areas and on the tracks to Komiatum.
Neiu Britain.38. The three airfields near Rabaul were bombed at least four times byFortresses (B. 17) and Liberators (B. 24). A small ship was sunk off CapeGloucester.Celebes. . ..39. Nine Liberators (B. 24) attacked I endari airfield, inflicting substantialdamage in the barracks area.T animbar Islands.40. Medium bombers and Beaufighters made two attacks on villages and the airfield on Selaru Island, and sank a small ship off the coast.A nstralia.41. Two attacks were made on Darwin by a total of 48 escorted bombers.Except for the destruction of three aircraft on the ground there was only slightmaterial damage and no casualties. Sixteen enemy bombers and four fighters were destroyed in combat for the loss of six Spitfires.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.. 42. No bombs were dropped on this country, but on the last two days of theperiod, minor machine-gunning occurred in the coastal area of East Anglia.On the night of the 4th/5th, in reply to our own batteries, the Kent coast wasshelled. There was some damage to house property at Folkestone, and atRamsgate where two persons were killed and three seriously injured.Casualties.43. Civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours on the 7th were twokilled and five seriously injured.Appendices I, II, III and IY will be published periodically.APPENDIX Y.Casualties to H.M. Auxiliary vessels and to Naval Personnel.L.S.T. 429 total loss by fire.The following casualties to naval personnel have been reported : Officers : 3 killed; 2 wounded; 1 missing.Ratings : 25 killed; 5 wounded; 3 missing.APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Germany.Cologne. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 4th july and covering nearly the whole of the town, shows two main areas of concentrateddamage. On the west bank of the river it is provisionally estimated that atleast 1,000 acres of the centre of the town have been 75 per cent, devastated.   On
the east bank, very heavy damage is visible throughout the districts of Kalk,Deutz, Buchheim and S. Mulheim, with many other incidents in Poll, Bayenthal.Siilz and Ehrenfeld.Damage at the Humboldt-Deutz factories at Kalk and Deutz is very severe.In the same area large sheds at the railway sidings have been destroyed, and theKalk chemical factory badly damaged. The West Deutsche Waggonfabrik, theVereinigte Stahlwerke Van der Zyhhen, the Citroen Werk at Poll and theMannesmann, Pohren u. Eisenhandel at Westhafen have all been more or less severely damaged.On the west bank, apart from the devastated area, there is very severe damageat the Gereon railway yard and at the main station.Friedrichshafen. During the attack on the 20th/21st June the Zeppelinhangar and the Z.F. gear works received direct hits causing fires.

An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the1st July, following the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 28th June, shows a number of fresh points of damage to dock buildings on either side of the entrance lock to theBassin de Penhouet. The dry dock itself, which was dry on the morning of the attack, is partly filled with water and appears to have been damaged. The southlock of the eastern entrance which was also dry and now has water in it has almost certainly been damaged. ^The seaplane workshops have received a direct hit, and two adjoining shedshave been gutted. The oxy-acetylene welding shops have been completely destroyed and the old liquid air factory damaged over a quarter of its area. Onthe Quai Demange one of the store sheds for submarines has been destroyed andanother damaged.Nantes I Bougon Aircraft Assembly Works.
