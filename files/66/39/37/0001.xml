THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 337.2Qth July, 1943.WAR CABINET.PALESTINE.I circulate for consideration by the War Cabinet the following telegram fromGeneral Smuts on this subject. General Smuts expresses views which I am sureshould be deeply weighed by my colleagues.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,26th July. 1943.While I am entirely in favour of the proposed message, and think that a standstill of controversial politics should be maintained during the war, I mustexpress my strong feeling that the Jewish world position will call for drastic action at the end of the war. It would be impossible to send Jews back toGermany and similar persecuting countries, and other provision would have tobe made for them in spite of Muslim intransigence.The last White Paper on Palestine leaves practically no outlet for them andwill call for revision. Either a Palestinian Jewish State would have to be constituted as part of a larger Arab confederation, or liberated areas like Libyaand others would have to accommodate surplus Jews, or both courses will haveto be adopted.Jewish sufferings and massacres make their reasonable requirements a first charge on Allied statesmanship which should take precedence over efforts toplacate Arabs or the like. Arabs have done very little for Allied cause in this war, while profiting immensely from our efforts in the last war. If we continueto forget or ignore Jewish claims we shall fail in our larger efforts on behalf ofa fair and just general settlement at end of this war.Jewish weakness should not make us forget moral strength of their case which goes to the root of whole issue in this war. If we fail the Jews it meansHitler&apos;s triumph in the fundamental item of his satanic creed. I urge this now,as I think it would be fatal for us to leave Jewish claims at the mercy of theirundeserving opponents at end of this war.[25808]
