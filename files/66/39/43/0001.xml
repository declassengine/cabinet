THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET. Gopy No.W.P. (43) 343.28th July, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE 1943 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.CANADA has had a round of visits from distinguished persons during themonth. Mme. Chiang Kai-shek addressed members of both Houses of parliament on the 16th June, and her Canadian visit was regarded as a great occasion,&quot;although the press were somewhat disconcerted by her remark that the Canadianwar effort, like that of China, had not been spectacular. On second thoughts, how-ever, this remark was interpreted as a compliment. The Montreal Star com-mented : &apos;&apos; Canadians are proud of their war effort, but somehow to hear itdescribed as unspectacular, like that six years&apos; lonely martyrdom for freedom inthe East, brings a blush to Canadian cheeks.&quot; One result of Mme. Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s visit has been the suggestion in the press that a more liberal attitudetowards Chinese immigration into Canada merits careful consideration, the montreal Gazette remarked, on the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 : &quot; To-daynobody defends this infamous piece of legislation.&quot;2. Other visitors were Queen Wilhelmina, who arrived by air to attend thechristening of her new grandchild; President Benes (whose visit evoked the com-ment &quot; Benes comes like Banquo&apos;s ghost to remind us all that we owe his nationa debt. We can never pay it in full, but we can try &quot;); Lord Halifax, who came toreceive the LL.D. degree from Laval University; and Sir William Beveridge. Inaddition, a number of United Kingdom Members of Parliament have been attending the conference of the Empire Parliamentary Association. In this connection theCanadian press suggest that post-war immigration is one of the most importantproblems which should be discussed by the Empire Parliamentary Association.Knowledge of the relative increase in the size of the French Canadian population has no doubt stimulated Canada&apos;s desire for migrants of British stock, and has a bearing on the recent suggestion in the Toronto Globe Mail that Canada could do with the transfer, by instalments, of 5 or 6 million people from the UnitedKingdom.3. Mr. Mackenzie King paid a visit to Washington during the month, andhe was followed by the Minister for Defence with his Chiefs of Staff, who weresummoned to Washington for the discussions on general strategy..4. The formation of a National Council for Canadian-Soviet friendship hasbeen announced. The dissolution of the Comintern had the effect that Communistparty, while still an illegal organisation in Canada, has of late received lessmarked official disapproval than hitherto. Tim Buck, the Communist leader, has announced the impending formation of a pew political party, a move which led the Liberal Halifax Chronicle to wonder whether&apos;the dissolution of the ThirdInternational was only a political ruse after all.
5. Of the Hot Springs Food Conference the Vancouver Sun remarked :&quot; Now that the conference has adjourned it is seen in its true perspective as thereal beginning of a sound economic order in the post-war world.&quot; Canada is&quot;taking a keen interest in the U.N.R.R.A., and, although in the draft agreement ithas not been suggested that she should be represented on the Central Committee,it is hoped that Canada may be given the chairmanship of the important SuppliesCommittee. The Montreal Gazette points out that the Dominion will provide more relief food than any other country except the United States.6. In local affairs a minor political storm arose as the result of a statement by Major Clark, K.C., speaker of the Ontario Legislative Assembly, that he wasin favour of the the union of Canada with the United States, and that, moreover,45 per cent, of Canadians supported him in this. The Leader of the ProgressiveConservative party in Ontario, Colonel Drew, immediately denounced MajorClark&apos;s speech as &quot; very improper and mischievous,&quot; and press criticism has beenequally outspoken, &quot; nonsense &quot; and &quot; insult to Canada &quot; being typical comments.In this connection and for what it is worth, the results of a Gallup Poll on thesubject of the Dominion&apos;s post-war status, showed that of those questioned 49 percent, (mostly of British stock) want Canada to remain within the British Common-wealth of Nations, 24 per cent, (mostly French Canadians) prefer independence,and 21 per cent, (mainly immigrants of foreign stocks) voted for federation withthe United States. This poll, at least, shows that more than twice as many averageCanadians prefer the present arrangement to any alternative.7. Another of these polls indicates that 67 per cent, of Canadians are infavour of free trade with the United States, a &quot; challenging result for sometraditional tenets of Canadian faith.&quot; The Ottawa Journal objects to the GallupPoll system on the ground that it is a grave source of mischief.8. In British Columbia the C.CF. secured a victory in a recent by-election.The seatin itself is of no outstanding importance, but the election was widelyregarded as a test of provincial opinion, and, as numerous Ministers thought it worth while to take part in the campaign, the result holds potential significance.An election will be held in the Province of Ontario on the 4th August. Inthis case arrangements have been made for soldiers to record their votes by proxyfor the first time.9. A certain amount of industrial unrest still persists. A strike of 10,000workers in Ontario and Quebec was settled during the month in so far as the,000 strikers in Quebec were concerned, but the Ontario steel strike still continues.10. In a statement in the Canadian House of Commons the Ministerof Munitions and Supply said that only 30 per cent, of the total Canadian war production went to the Canadian Forces at home and overseas. All the rest went to Britain, United States, Australia, New Zealand and other Allies. Moreover,only 4 per cent, of the men engaged in war industry, are on deferment from military service.Naval, Military and Air Activities.11. 1st Canadian Division and 1st Canadian Army Tank Brigade sailed from the United Kingdom during the last week of the month to take part in the landing operations in Sicily.12. During June various R.C.A.F. Squadrons completed conversion frommedium to heavy bombers; two of them, Nos. 426 and 434 now in process of conversion, will shortly be operational, the former with Lancaster II, the latterwith Ffalifax aircraft. The formation of No. 433 Squadron has been temporarilysuspended.13. Three Wellington Bomber Squadrons left United Kingdom for temporary duty with the Strategic Air Force in North Africa.14. The heavy programme of bombing in the Ruhr, begun in May, was continued throughout the latter part, of June, and again accounted for high losses,although the percentage was slightly lower than during May. From the month&apos;operations 18 Fighters and 48 Bombers were reported missing.15. Several Night Fighter Units have now been inactive for many weeks,and it is hoped that some change in equipment may be made to enable these squadrons to take their share in Intruder and other similar activities.
16. No. 403 Spitfire Squadron claimed five enemy aircraft destroyed duringthe month. No. 416 Spitfire Squadron obtained a 100 per cent.&apos; pass in a course in deck-landings recently, the only Squadron so far to obtain full marks. No. 417Spitfire Squadron was visited by His Majesty The King and also by the Secretaryof State for Air towards the end of the month.Economic and Financial.17. The manner in which the Canadian mutual aid system will function isstill under discussion with the Canadian authorities, and the scheme has not yetcome into operation.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.18. As regards the Pacific, Allied prospects there continue to be regarded with satisfaction, a view which was increased by Mr. Curtin&apos;s statement inthe middle of June that the Japanese could not now invade Australia. after his earlier warnings, this tended to bewilder the public, but there is a feeling that-the statement was prompted by political considerations. The PrimeMinisters statement, too, that, as a result of Dr. Evatt&apos;s visit to the UnitedStates, President roosevelt&apos;s approval has been secured for the delivery ofthe remaining aircraft needed to complete the R.A.A.F. programme was regardedas reassuring. This arrangement will provide for a 60 per cent, increase in thepresent strength of the R.A.A.F.19. The renewed Japanese offensive in China was prominently reported,and newspapers stressed the urgent need for priority for war supplies to China.20. The publication of the Empire war casualty figures provided the presswith an opportunity to point out that they gave the answer to the infamous lieof enemy propaganda that &apos;&apos; the Dominions were being used to bear the brunt ofthe fighting.&quot; Nevertheless, Australian losses in Greece, Crete, North africa and New Guinea have been severe, the Sydney Sunday Telegraph stating thatthe Allied casualties in New Guinea were greater than those of the Allies in tunisia.21. Discussions on post-war civil aviation continue, the general lineemphasised being that co-operation, and not- competition, must be the order ofthe day.22.   A political crisis occurred during June, which made an early electioninevitable.   This is to take place on the 21st August.   Growing and generaldissatisfaction with the Government on three main counts, namely, its ineffectivehandling of the industrial situation, the food problem and its financial policy,had culminated in the introduction of a vote of censure by the Opposition.   the debate which followed was unusually bitter in tone and, though the Governmentsurvived the motion by a majority of a single vote, Mr. Curtin expressed theopinion that the present Parliament had just about exhausted its resources forconstructive legislation.   The regrettable conduct of Mr. Ward, the Minister ofLabour,  was primarily responsible  for  the acrimonious  and  recriminatorycharacter of the proceedings.    In an attempt to discredit the Opposition,Mr. Ward repeated allegations that the previous Government had made plans to abandon to the Japanese all Australian territory north of the so-called&quot; Brisbane Line &quot; in the event of an invasion.   The Prime Minister was, however,forced to admit that this plan was never in fact submitted to the previous government, but that it was actually laid before his own Cabinet and rejected by them.   On the Prime Minister&apos;s admission of the facts about the &quot; BrisbaneLine,&quot; Mr. Ward went on to allege that an important document (by implicationan earlier &quot; Brisbane Line &quot; plan) was missing from official files.   The PrimeMinister, pressed by the maligned Opposition, then stated that all files werecomplete, but he made an attempt to shield Mr. Ward by stating that he&quot; withdrew a statement made in the belief that it was based on reliable information.&quot;   The Opposition thereupon demanded a Royal Commission to investigate the sources of Mr. Ward&apos;s information.   In the meanwhile, the PrimeMinister suspended the Minister from the performance of his duties.  His conductas Minister of Labour has been an embarrassment to the Government ever since it took office, and Mr. Curtin&apos;s efforts to shield a colleague, even to the extentof compromising his own. reputation, were the cause of the present crisis.
23. The Government suffered a defeat in the Senate by the adoption, ofan Opposition amendment to the Election Bill, limiting the extension of the franchise to members of the Forces under 21 to those who had served outsideAustralia.24. An article on the declining birth-rate says that Australia may haveto waive her preference for migrants of British stock, who may be in short supplyafter the war. Foreign immigration from European countries may, however,lead to the creation of minority problems.25. As a result of Dr. Evatt&apos;s visit to the United Kingdom, there has beena reappearance of the suggestion that it would be appropriate for a UnitedKinsrdom Minister to visit Australia.Naval, Military and Air Activities.26. H.M. Australian Minesweeper Wallaroo was sunk in collision off thewest coast of Australia on the 11th. H.M.A.S. KanimUa was recommissionedas a Landing Ship Infantry (Large) and H.M. Australian Minesweeper Araratwas commissioned during the month.27. It has been decided to reorganise the 3rd Australian Army TankBrigade into two self-contained Army Tank Battalion Groups.28. The Government recently approved a scheme under which selectedItalian &apos;&apos; other rank &apos;&apos; prisoners of war might be employed without guards onrural properties in the custody of private employers. As a start a total of 100prisoners of war are now. employed in this manner, and from each of the centreswhere they are working applications have been received for an increasedallocation.29. The work done in connection with Malaria control in the forwardbases area of Port Moresby and Milne Bay has proved highly successful. Themalarial&quot; sick rate at Milne Bay has dropped from 55 per thousand per week inDecember 1942 to 2-7 per thousand per week.30. At the end of June there were 178,207 United States forces inAustralia, including 125,027 ground troops.NEW ZEALAND.31. Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement about the intensification of the war against japan was warmly welcomed, and New Zealand looks forward to developments in the Pacific with confidence and optimism. The danger.of a Japanese attackon New Zealand is now thought to be negligible, and the Prime Ministerannounced that, with a view to meeting the requirements of the Air Force and ofindustry, the New Zealand army was to be considerably reduced. The NewZealand press urges still further army reductions, and strongly endorses arecruiting appeal for the Air Force which followed on a statement by the Chiefof Air Staff, that, as a result of a decline in the number of volunteers, there wasa prospect of a serious shortage of personnel for the P.N.Z.A.F.- 32. The recent House of Lords debate on migration, a subject whichinterests New Zealand closely, was reported fully and read with keen interest,since migration is considered to be a leading factor in determining New Zealand&apos;sdestiny. One fear expressed was that the scale of the United Kingdom social services may hinder Empire migration, and reciprocity between the UnitedKingdom and New Zealand is suggested as a practicable possibility which wouldhave a definite bearing on the attractions of New Zealand to potential migrants.In this connexion, New Zealand and Australia have recently concluded a reciprocal pensions agreement; the New Zealand Government has increasedservice disability pensions. The school-leaving age has also been raised to 15,and will subsequently be raised to 16.33. The Prime&apos; Minister announced that a general election would be heldin September. Nobody appears particularly to want this, and it is difficult &quot;to foresee any likelihood of a major change in the present state of the parties. TheMinister of Health is putting the final touches to a plan for a State medical service which he hopes to see established before the end of the war. It willmake provision not only for medical treatment, but also provide home nursingftiad domestic aid services.
34.&apos; The Third War Loan Campaign, with an objective of  35 million, hasbeen remarkably successful. Much enthusiasm was evinced in all parts of thecountry at the tour of the Lancaster Bomber, which came on from Australia inconnexion with the savings campaign.35. . General Sir Bernard Freyberg, V.C., the Commander of the NewZealand Forces in North Africa, was given a tremendous welcome on his firstvisit home after the successful North African operations. An article by a NewZealand correspondent containing frank criticism of the Americans in the north african campaign was widely published. There is said to be considerable unrestamong the New Zealand troops in.Africa, owing to reports of the bad behaviour of the United States Forces in New Zealand, and a strongly-worded exhortationfrom the Church, appealing to New Zealand women for loyalty to their husbandsand fiances overseas was published in the New Zealand press.36. The loss of Mr. Coates is a blow to the war administration, and itseems generally agreed that there is no one at present capable of taking his place.The Prime Minister of New Zeland referred to Mr. Coates&apos;s services as &quot; invalu-able.&quot; Mr. Coates was a strong influence in favour of the maximum contribution by New Zealand to the prosecution of the war. Mr. Wm. Perry, a Member of theLegislative Council and President of the Returned Services Association, has beenappointed as Mr. Coates&apos;s successor in the War Cabinet, though this is thought to be inspired by the Governments desire to provide outward evidence of aunity which does not in fact exist.Naval, Military and Air Activities.37. H.M.N.Z. Cruiser Achilles while refitting at Portsmouth was damagedon the 22nd by an explosion in an oil tank.38. The 3rd New Zealand Division is to be a Two-Brigade Division. Unitspreviously ear-marked to bring the 3rd Division up to three Brigades will be absorbed in overseas drafts.39. The Fiji Brigade Group is ready for despatch to other theatres of war.A Fiji Infantry Battalion and a Fiji Commando are in the Solomons under united States command where they have been well reported on.40\ Under the scheme of military reorganisation recently decided upon, theTerritorial Army will comprise Mobilised and Non-Mobilised Territorial forces;the former for administration, training and maintenance duties, will be approxi-mately 19,000 strong; the latter will contain about 30,000 men who will carry out&apos;one month&apos;s recruit training, two days per month additional training and 28 clays&apos;annual unit training.41. Territorial forces trainees will be drawn from single men and married men, with no more than three children, grades 1 and 2, aged 18 to 40.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.42. The attention of South Africans during June seems to have been mainlyconcentrated on the forthcoming election (held on the 7th July). Comment on other matters followed generally on party lines.43. The size of the Coalition majority is the main point of interest in theUnion election, where General Smuts&apos;s return to power is a foregone conclusion.General Smuts has emphasised that every vote is needed, for only if the Govern-ment is returned with a strong majority&quot; will it be sure of peace at home, and be free to take a full share in reconstruction and the other world-wide problems withwhich it will have to deal in the years after the war. 17 United Party candidateswere returned unopposed, and one member of the Nationalist Party, Dr. Malan.There is a spirit of defeatism abroad among the Nationalists owing to the wide-spread feeling that the Party is not out to win the election. Dr. Malan&apos;s hope isfor a substantial vote, which would demonstrate the continued vigour of his Party,and form a basis for a return to power as soon as the war is over. The Nationalistleader&apos;s republican enthusiasm has been called in doubt, with consequent perturba-tion amongst certain of his followers, as a result of his evasive utterances on thesubject at a public meeting. The Cape Coloured vote will have an appreciableinfluence on the result of the election; the recent establishment of the CapeColoured Advisory Council has unfortunately antagonised the coloured com-munity, and the Communist Party is out to profit from this.   It is expected that
the Labour Party will be returned in greater strength, but it is clearly embarrased by the recent revolt of the Left Wing section, which broke away and formed anIndependent Labour Party. The soldiers&apos; vote will represent about 10 per cent,of the total.44. The Prime Minister promised South Africans that they would havesocial security after the war, as it was the policy of the Coalition Governmentto provide food, shelter and other essentials for those who, because of sickness,old age or misfortune, were unable to provide for themselves.45. In a review of the Union&apos;s war effort, General Smuts said that 86,000South Africans had served overseas since the war began and that 300,000 part-time or full-time volunteers had been raised,&quot;including 60,000 women.46. It is gradually becoming more widely realised that, if South Africa&apos;industrial expansion is to proceed, apace, it will be necessary to break down the colour bar hitherto maintained, otherwise great wastage of labour is inevitable.An instance of this was brought to the notice of the Trades and Labour Councilrecently when a bricklayer reported that because native labourers were nevertrained to do their work properly, he needed four of them to keep him going,whereas in Australia one labourer kept two bricklayers busy. Similar wastageoccurs in many South African industries.47. The idea of a Pan-African Federation continues to receive attention.The Prime Minister has suggested a consultative council which would meetregularly to discuss the affairs of Southern Africa &apos;&apos; without any of the Statesrenouncing their present political connexions.&quot; He also said: &quot;South Africalooks towards closer relationship and larger co-operation with the neighbouringStates to the North.&quot; The possibility of a Customs Union between South africa and- Southern Rhodesia has been envisaged. The Natal Mercury expressed thehope that Italian influence will be removed from the entire continent of Africa.48. News of the proposed conference on post-war civil aviation between theUnited Kingdom and the United States is of particular interest to South Africa,and the necessity for the formation of a civil aviation policy by the UnionGovernment is now being urged. Credit is given to the United Kingdom for hersincerity in advocating international control, but some anxiety is evidently feltabout the intentions of the United States.49. The publication during June of the casualties suffered by the wholeBritish Commonwealth during the war has brought, according to the newspaperFriend, the profoundly gratifying reflection that the numbers killed are, so far,small in comparison with the last war. The fact that nearly four times as manysoldiers from Britain have so far been killed than from all other Commonwealthnations lumped together gave the death blow to the &quot; old and slanderous &quot; Nazistory that Dominion troops were left to do all the fighting.EIRE.50. Polling took place in the Eire general election on the 22nd June. Theresult was as follows : Fianna Fail 67 seats, Fine Gael 32, Labour 17, Farmers 14,and Independents 8.51. The elections were held in an atmosphere of unreality and merely because the old Dail had reached its legal time limit. There was no outstandingissue between the various parties, who with equal emphasis were all agreed on maintaining the present policy of neutrality in the war. Lacking other stimulus,the election was fought largely on old cleavages and personal animosities. In thethe old Dail Mr. de Valera&apos;s party, Fianna Fail, had 77 seats, and Fine Gael,led by Mr. Cosgrave, had 45, the remainder being split among sectional groups,including Labour. Thus Mr. de Valera had a majority of 16 over all parties. Inthe recent election, the unjustifiable claim that he and. his party were solely responsible for saving Eire from the horrors of war stood him in good steadat the polls. He was all out for a personal triumph and for a clear majorityover all parties, but, in.fact, he has suffered a considerable personal setback inthat, apart from his loss of 10 seats, he only polled 42 per cent, of the votes.Mr. Cosgrave, who advocated a National Government but otherwise lacked apolicy; fared even worse. The increase in the sectional groups indicates that thepeople of Eire as a whole are tiring of the old personal and party animosities.
52. There is no symptom whatever in these results of any growing warmthtowards .the Allied cause. On the contrary, the partial eclipse of Fine Gaelweakens the Commonwealth outlook. Neutrality is a religion. The censorshiphas been ruthless and effective. The recent official refusal to permit SenorMadariaga to visit Eire on the ground that &quot;It is highly objectionable that foreign statesmen should visit Eire during the war to discuss post-war problems &quot;is typical of Eire&apos;s present policy of the closed mind.53. Mr. de Valera with reduced prestige and no mandate will be calledupon to assume the leadership of a Dail in which he cannot command a majority.He can woo the Farmers&apos; party for a measure of support, but wooing is nothis speciality: Fine Gael and Labour will oppose him solidly. It may be assumed that he will carry on with a measure of support from Farmers and Independents.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.X     K/ U V V WKASU ,54. Interest in the war was partially revived during June by the progressof the air war, the successful operations in the Mediterranean, and the expecta-tions of an early opening of a second front in Europe. But, generally speaking,the war no longer takes first place in the public mind, and the ultimate victory of the United Nations is taken for granted: internal economic problems asregards foods and prices have now acquired such extraordinary significance andurgency as to preclude sustained interest in other matters. No political movesof any significance occurred during June, and no appreciable advance seems tohave been made towards the resumption of ministerial government in any of thefive Provinces which are still administered by Governors under Section 93 of theGovernment of India Act.55. The appointment of the late Commander-in-Chief to succeedLord Linlithgow as Viceroy in October had a mixed reception, but criticismwas more restrained than had been expected, and there was a disposition to givethe new Viceroy a chance, while the reappointment of General Auchinleck as commander-in-Chief has been generally welcomed.External and Frontier Relations.56. Afghanistan. -The Soviet Ambassador followed up Sir Francis Wylie&apos;approach to the Afghan Government with parallel representations on the subjectof the intrigues directed against the Soviet Government at the instigation ofthe Axis Legations. He demanded the immediate liquidation of the refugeeorganisation responsible for these intrigues and the arrest of the leaders, and recommended the Afghan Government in their own interest to reduce the staffs of the Axis Legations to a Minister and Secretary each. The Prime Ministertold him that it was impossible to accept recommendations affecting his own internal affairs, whether they came from the Soviet Government or any great power, and claimed that since the beginning of the war he had faithfully pursueda policy of rigid neutrality, and that he had done, and was doing, everything&apos;possible to make that policy effective on the internal side. Sir Francis Wyliegathered from his colleague that the Soviet Government were much gratified a tour co-operation over this affair. A few days later Sir Francis Wylie saw the.Foreign Minister, and enquired what action the Afghan Government had takento meet our requirements. The Foreign Minister said that none of the threechief leaders had been arrested as yet, though he promised that they would be,but the remaining thirty-three persons had all been warned to desist immediatelyfrom the activities with which we charged them. As regards the Axis Legations,the Afghan Government could not accept our advice, which might lead to ruptureof relations with the Axis countries, without consulting the country. They haddefinite evidence against two Germans only, but no real evidence against theItalians or Japanese. They had, however, redoubled their control over membersof the Legation staffs, and had warned the German Minister that if they gotevidence of new intrigues they would change their policy. The Soviet Ambassadorreceived much the same sort of reply when he enquired subsequently what theosition was. The Foreign Minister told him that a number of persons on theoviet list had already been arrested, and that if any further evidence againstthe rest became available, the Afghan Government would decide what wasnecessary to do. He promised a more definite reply as to the further stepscontemplated by the Afghan Government in a few days&apos; time.
Thus the Afghan Government have given certain valuable assurances but have so far taken few concrete steps to meet our requirements and further pressure is likely to be necessary. Our next step is at present being considered in consultation with the Soviet Government.57. The North-West Frontier. Except for minor incidents in Waziristanwith the Faqir of Ipi&apos;s gangs of deserters and hostiles, the frontier remains satis-factorily quiet. In North Waziristan. it is reported that the Tunisian victorycelebrations, at which Hurricanes of the I.A.F. gave an exhibition, had a markedeffect on tribal leaders. The Governor of the North-West Frontier Province has reported that in Waziristan all sections seemed to be tired of hostilities and thegeneral opinion among the maliks was that despite the efforts of the Faqir of Ipithe kettle would not boil up this year.58. Nepal. In asking His Majesty&apos;s Minister to send his congratulations to His Majesty on the occasion of his birthday, the Maharaja added that with theousting of the enemy from Africa, Nepal felt that final victory could not be faroff and prayed for early victory to the Allied Nations, and added glory toHis Majesty&apos;s reign.59. Tibet. There have been no further developments in the matter of Chinesetroop movements directed against Tibet, and it may be hoped that our interventionwill have have been sufficient to prevent the matter coming to a head. TheTibetans for their part, in response to our request, gave a categorical denial ofany aggressive intentions against China. In order, however, to leave the Ghineseunder no misapprehension as to our attitude, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inChungking is being instructed to inform the Acting Minister for Foreign affairs that His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to have Dr. Soong&apos;s assurance that therewas not and would not be a concentration of Chinese troops against Tibet. Theyappreciate that the Chinese Government regard Tibet as part of China; on theother hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government regard Tibet as an autonomous State,which has in fact managed its affairs satisfactorily for the last 32 years withoutany outside control. Any attempt on the part of the (Chinese to upset the existing position in Tibet would create disturbed conditions on the Indian frontier, whichwould be of concern to us and, apart from other considerations, we shoulddeprecate the diversion of China&apos;s military resources from the war against Japan.Sir Horace Seymour is at the same time being informed that if possible anyfurther discussion on the status of Tibet should be avoided, but if this becomesunavoidable either at Chungking or elsewhere, His Majesty&apos;s Government havedecided that the line to be taken should be that our continued recognition of chinese suzerainty over Tibet is dependent on the maintenance of Tibetanautonomy; and that any amicable arrangement which China felt disposed to makewith Tibet whereby the latter recognised China&apos;s suzerainty in return for an agreed frontier, and an undertaking to recognise Tibetan autonomy, would be welcomed by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India, who wouldbe glad to offer any help desired towards this end.It is of interest in this connection that two American officers, Captain Tolstoyand Lieutenant Doland, were in Lhasa throughout last winter on a mission fromthe President. Their reactions appear to have been wholeheartedly in support ofTibetan independence. This first direct American contact with the TibetanGovernment and Tibetan affairs may have important results on the ultimate solution of the problem of the relations of Tibet with China.60. Sinkiang.-The Chinese Government have agreed to the appointmentof Mr. Turrall as Consul at Urumchi under the superintendence of the Consul-General, Kashgar. Marked improvement in the local atmosphere continues andin the behaviour of the local people and officials at Kashgar.Finance.61.   Nothing to report.- Economic:62,   Nothing to report.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.63. Royal Indian Navy. The Bittern class sloop Narbada, built in UnitedKingdom, is now completing working-up trials, and the Black Swan class sloopKistna was launched on the 22nd April.
u1/The following vessels were completed in India during May : Two 105-ft. M.M.Ss.One Fairmile.Two 72-ft. M.Ls. ;64. Military. Operations in Arakan are virtually at a standstill owingto the monsoon.The movements of Muslims in Arakan have been restricted by the Japanese,and most of them are said to be pro-British.In the Chin Hills the Japanese are digging in East of Fort White. Theyhave been trying to push forward so as. to command the exits from the valleyswhen the rains end.On the Chindwin front a Japanese patrol was caught between patrols ofMahrattas and Seaforth Highlanders. The Japanese attempted a bayonetcharge against the latter and some 40 of them were killed.The Government of India have accepted a proposal by the Government of burma that the Burma Army should be placed under the C.-in-C, India, forpurposes of future operations. The provisional date of transfer has been fixedas the 1st November, 1943.65. Air. Attacks have been maintained by the R.A.F. and U.S.A.A.F. on railways and docks throughout the month.15 Japanese bombers, with an escort of 20 fighters, attacked Chittagongairfield early in the month. They destroyed one aircraft and damaged two onthe ground. Enemy casualties were four destroyed, four probably destroyed,three damaged.66. General. The Army intake of recruits for May was .49,000. the decrease is partly due to agricultural activities and the seasonal cessation ofGurkha recruitment. Favourable prices obtainable for grain produce and heavy demands for labour at high prices combined with shrinkage of suitableman-power are also tending to make recruitment more difficult.Special attention is being paid to the organisation and equipment of theArmy for jungle warfare. India now has four types of division : armoured,light, A. and M.T. (Animal and Motor Transport) and M.T. A new type of artillery regiment is being formed called &quot; Jungle Field Regiment.&quot;The victory in North Africa was celebrated throughout India on the21st.May by parades, distribution of food and&apos;dothes to the poor, entertainmentof troops and free cinema performances. Among gifts received was Rs.50,000from the Raja Bahadur of Ramgarh. The Governor of Bihar allotted this tothe fund for Christmas gifts for the troops in the Eastern Army.The triumphant conclusion of the North Africa campaign has put freshconfidence into the troops in India, and has, to some extent, diverted attention from the Arakan operations.Morale continues to be good. Welfare arrangements have done much to keepthe Army contented. The main complaints of British troops are still the tardi-ness of the mail, though the position has recently improved considerably, andthe high cost of essential articles such as tooth paste which are not subject tocontrol. Indian troops remain reasonably satisfied with the conditions underwhich they serve. Many, however, continue to be apprehensive for the welfare of their families who are in many cases hard hit by profiteering and hoardingin its various forms.The reappointment of General Sir Claude Auchinleck as Commander-in-Chief, India, has been welcomed by all ranks.Relations with civilians are satisfactory, though they are marred in many areas by unashamed profiteering by banias.Efforts to educate both British and Indian troops in an appreciation of the strategy of the war and the ideals for which we are fighting have lately begun to have an encouraging response.A Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and.Airmen&apos;s Families Association Branch has beenestablished with Headquarters at G.H.Q., Simla,, and sub-offices at Lahore,Calcutta and Bangalore. The sub-offices are staffed by voluntary workers.There is also an office in Ceylon. S.S.A.E.A. deals with problems of a non-legalnature and enquiries as to the whereabouts and welfare of relatives. Legal aidsections to deal with legal problems will also shortly be established at the abovecentres.
BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.67. Occupied Burma.A number of reports received mention parties of Burmans being sent to japan. Some of these visits are by politicians and public men for short periodsand others are by students for technical, including military, studies.Two of the Shan States adjoining Siam are reported to have been handedover by Japan to Siam in gratitude for that country&apos;s aid to her.68. Frontier Administration.In the Chin Hills area a Japanese thrust towards Tiddim has beenhalted, and they have withdrawn, after a brief occupation, from Fort White.The presence of Chinese troops in Northern Myitkyina aggravates the riceshortage there, where the supply situation is still unsatisfactory.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &apos;&apos; Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners and-the British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.69. Ceylon.-The level of Ceylon&apos;s total reserves of cereals is slightly more satisfactory than at the time of last month&apos;s report, and the arrivals expectedduring July should enable the present level to be maintained.70. On the other hand, the rice supply position gives rise to even moreanxiety than before. Negotiations by the Ministry of Food representative inEgypt for the acquisition of Egypt&apos;s present rice surplus have now been com-pleted, and out of the total amount purchased Ceylon has been provisionallyallocated 101,000 tons, of which about 35,000 tons have been shipped to date. It ishoped that the balance will be shipped at the rate of about 15,000 tons per month,between June and October.71. Supplies of rice from India have been coming forward only in verysmall quantities, and the quotas which the Government of India had provisionally-programmed for export to Ceylon in June and July have been withdrawn. TheGovernment&apos;of India have definitely agreed to help Ceylon with cereal supplies,but, owing to the difficulty of India&apos;s own &quot;rice position, the bulk of the cerealsoffered are grains other than rice, mainly wheat.. Ceylon&apos;s capacity to make useof unmilled wheat is limited, and the matter is at present the subject of correspondence between the two Governments and between them and London.72. There is some uncertainty about the amount of Ceylon&apos;s own local ricecrop, mainly grown by peasant cultivators. This is, of course, always a difficult matter to estimate, and I am awaiting further information from Ceylon about it.Supplies other than Food. -73. Textiles. Owing to the very heavy demands upon the United Kingdomtextile industry, the United Kingdom export quota for West Africa for the july-September quarter has had to be cut by 500 tons. Generally, the position with regard to supplies of textiles for the Colonies continues to give cause for concern, and the Chairman of the East African Supplies and Production Board,Mr. C. R. Lockhart, is paying a short visit to this country to discuss the questionof supplies for East Africa, particularly from India. The Deputy Director ofSupplies in Nigeria, Mr. G. F. T. Colby, has also arrived in this country, andthis and other supply questions affecting Nigeria will be discussed with him.British West Africa Oilseed Production.74. In my last report I referred to the vigorous action being taken in west Africa to stimulate the production of oilseeds. I am glad to say that recentreturns of purchases of palm kernels in Nigeria show that this action is alreadyproducing good results, while production in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coastalso continues to proceed favourably.
Defence.Ceylon.75. Reference paragraph 108 of the report for February, the recentlyformed guerrilla force known as the Ceylon Levies has had to be disbanded owingto the preference shown by suitable personnel for enlistment in the Ceylon defence force, the lack of suitable leaders, the difficulty of making arms available and difficulties of administration. The personnel are being allowed to enlist in the ceylon Defence Force.British Solomon Islands Protectorate.76. The High Commissioner for the Western Pacific visited Santo,Guadalcanal, Florida and Tulagi from the 3rd to 10th June. He reports that relations between the United States and British authorities everywhere are mostcordial and co-operation first class. The United States Corps Commander has given orders that no measures affecting Protectorate interests may be taken without consulting Mr. Bengough, who has been acting as Resident Commissionersince the departure of Lt.-Col. Marchant (now in this country). The LabourCorps (see paragraph 119 (a) of the report for March) is giving satisfaction, andthe Commanding General has asked for its members to be increased by 2,400.The Service Battalion (see paragraph 119 (b) of the report for March) is beingdisbanded, except for about thirty picked men who are to be incorporated in theFiji Commando. It is felt by both the British and United States authorities that Solomon Islanders with little training are useful only in their own and adjacent islands, and that, now Guadalcanal is cleaned up, the Battalion serveslittle useful purpose. Reference paragraph 120 of the import for March,Sir Philip Mitchell reports that the punitive bombing of native villages by theUnited States Service authorities has ceased.Re-ports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.77. There were no developments in Arab politics. His Majesty Ibn Saud&apos;spronouncement on Palestine was acclaimed in the Arabic press. A visit byNahas Pasha was popular as strengthening the hope of Egyptian support for thePalestine-Arab cause. Nahas Pasha behaved with great circumspection whenpolitical questions were raised.78. Jewish politics were still confused with indications of internal dissen-sion on the question of co-operation with the Government, particularly on thequestion of post-war reconstruction. The Political Department of the jewish agency, however, was more forthcoming than for many months. A strike by the-whole of the Jewish community (excepting war industries and essential services)staged by the Vaad Leumi, to protest against the Allies&apos; inactivity in rescuingJews from Europe, took place on the 15th June.In general, public security was satisfactory, but three British constables were killed by bandits.79. There was one serious theft of ammunition during the month, when17,500 rounds were taken from an explosives store near an airfield. following upon the discharge of a firearm in a building at Tel Aviv, the police discovereda substantial cache of bombs, explosives, signalling apparatus, ammunition andarms, including a light machine gun.West Indies.80. During May and June a number of labourers were recruited in the bahamas for work in Florida on agricultural projects and farms, and up to datenearly 3,000 out of the total of 5,000 men and women have left the colony. Thelabourers are for the most part housed in camps, and their contracts of work are made direct with the United States Department of Agriculture, though mostof them will be employed by private employer?, The contract and conditions ofwork seem generally very satisfactory, and periodic visits are paid to the menby an officer of the Colonial government. So far there has been one slightdisturbance in which one man has been dangerously wounded, but the complaintsmade by the workers have been satisfactorily settled, and it is reported thatthere is no animosity against the United States authorities administering the camp.81. Some 9,000 labourers have also been engaged in Jamaica for agricultural work in the United States.   A special officer has been appointed by the Jamaica
Government as Liaison Officer. Some difficulties have arisen with regard to thearrangements for placing the men.82. It was decided to make an offer to the United States to.meet, underReciprocal Aid, compensation paid for private property expropriated for the bases leased to the United States under the Bases Agreement (see report forMay). The offer has been made and the United States have accepted it withappreciation. A public announcement in the United States and in the territories concerned is contemplated.French Volunteers in - Wind-toard Islands.83. A steady stream of French subjects is still coming to Dominica and at . Lucia from Martinique and Guadeloupe. Those who are accepted as fit formilitary service are being sent for training to the United States, and a party of 929 left on the 11th June. The remainder consist mostly of men not regardedas fit for service by United States standards. On the 20th June there were,500 men, including those under military age, 460 women and 120 children inDominica and St. Lucia. Many of them came over not so much from a wish to volunteer as to obtain food, which is short in the French possessions. It was hoped to evacuate them to French Guiana, but the most recent developments inthe French West Indies suggest that the better course may be for them nowto return to their own homes.84. An attempt to overthrow the Vichy authorities in Guadeloupe tookplace on the 4th June and failed. The leader was a coloured man, namedValentino, who had been appointed president of the Executive Delegation ofthe Council-General in June 1940, and appears to be recognised by leading menin Guadeloupe as the legal representative of the island. He took a firm stand against the Armistice.. in 1940 and was interned, but was liberated fromDevil&apos;s Island in March 1943. According to his own account he was taken toGuadeloupe on an American destroyer. After the failure of his attempt hewithdrew to Dominica, where he remains pending arrangements for his passage to Free French territory.Ceylon.85. Bribery Commission. In May 1943 the report of the BriberyCommission appointed to enquire into the alleged receipt of gratifications bymembers of the State Council was published. Five elected members were foundguilty of receiving, bribes. All these elected members except one, together with three European nominated members also found to come within the commission^terms of reference, resigned forthwith. In accepting their resignations theGovernor made it clear that the European members were guilty of a technicaloffence only, and that no suggestion of opprobrium attached to them. Anordinance was passed on the 5th June to enable the member who refused to resignto be expelled from the council.86. Constitution.-The declaration made by His Majesty&apos;s Government atthe end of May on post-war constitutional reform in Ceylon was on the whole-received unfavourably by the Ceylon press. In the State Council, however,Ministers defined their interpretation of the terms of the declaration, and theGovernor, at their request, telegraphed their statement to the Secretary of State,who replied that, for reasons given in the declaration/Ministers should not expect any detailed comments at this stage and reiterated the assurance that, oncevictory was achieved, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be most ready to examineany scheme formulated by Ministers in accordance with the terms of thedeclaration. The Governor subsequently warned the Secretary of State that he expected that Ministers would go back on their, stated intention to proceed withthe framing of a Constitution on the basis of their interpretation of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments declaration, and he later reported that Ministers had sought an interview with him. - The outcome of this interview is now awaited.87.   Labour Report. The report by Major G. St. J. Orde Browne, LabourAdviser to the Secretary of State, on labour conditions in Ceylon, Mauritius and.Malaya, was published in this country and in Cevlon and Mauritius on the11th June as Cmd. 6423.
