July 194-3.Copy No. ^WAR CABINET.BUILDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE UNITED STATES FORCES.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.1. As requested by the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 9th July, Ihave discussed with the Minister of Labour and National Service, the Secretaryof State for War, the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of Works, theamount of labour required to meet essential United States requirements and how this additional labour can best be found.2. The requirements recently notified by the United States authorities havebeen analysed with the following result (a) War Office Programme. The allocation of building labour at present approved for the War Office programme falls to 35,000 men by theend of September. The Secretary of State for War informs me thatif his Departments building labour force could be maintained at this figure until the end of the year, it would then be possible to carry outall the building required by the United States ground forces exceptfor certain items requiring the employment of about 8,000 men for  months. On the other hand, he thinks that the Americans could be persuaded to accept certain alternative arrangements of a more make-shift character and to make certain additional labour available froma reserve of their own which would make it possible to dispense withthe whole of this additional requirement.(b) Air Ministry Programme. A number of adjustments are proposed inorder to make as much accommodation as possible available for theUnited States Forces without new construction. After making full allowance for this, additional works must be constructed requiring the following estimated amount of British civilian labour :  Aug. .-. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec.8,350 10.250 10,150 9,050 8,400This would be additional to the labour force required for the rest of theAir Ministry programme, i.e., about 90,000 to the end of September,as approved by the War Cabinet and about 80,000 for the period from October to December (Air Ministry estimate).(c) The above calculations assume that the maximum use will be made ofUnited States Service labour so far Jis this can be made available under their present plans for the shipment of constructional troops.3. In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet at their meetingon the 3rd June, no more men will be called up from the building industry, except the 18-year olds, before the end of September. It is not, therefore, possible forany further modification of call-up arrangements to increase the labour forceavailable for the Government building programme as a whole during August and september. The Minister of Labour, however, advises that it should be possibleto maintain the Air Ministry building labour force at 100,000 men to the endof September if the Minister of Works can be given authority to arrange for thetransfer of men, as far as may be necessary, to the most urgent Air Ministrycontracts from less urgent work. This should substantially meet the additional requirements shown in paragraph 2 (b) above for August and September.[25759]SECRET.W.P. (43) 311.15th July, 1943.
4. For the period from October onwards rather different considerationsarise : (a) On present plans it is proposed to call up immediately after the end ofSeptember about 15,000 men whose call-up has been postponed underthe War Cabinet decision of the 3rd June.(b) Thereafter a further substantial number of men are due to be called up from the building industry either for the Services or for the munitionsindustry.(c) It will be very difficult, and probably impossible, to maintain the building labour force required for our own needs, quite apart from these additional United States requirements, without some modification of present call-up plans. On present arrangements there will be asubstantial gap between our own requirements and the building labour force available.id) Any further modification of these call-up plans in order to make men available for building for the Americans would seriously affect thenumber of men available for the Services and for munitions work.5. The Minister of Labour is therefore unable to recommend any modifica-tion of call-up plans in order to make additional men available for buildingfrom October onwards. The Secretary of State for WTar has also urged that from the point of view of future operations based on this country it is important to ensure that the United States Forces should include a sufficient number of construction and labour troops to provide for their own administrative heeds.6. I therefore recommend that a building labour force of 100,000 men shouldbe approved for the Air Ministry for August and September; and. that the americans should be informed that we shall be able, with considerable difficulty,to make available enough additional labour to carry out the essential worksrequired by them up to the end of September, but that in view of our general shortage of manpower we foresee grave difficulties in carrying thereafter theadditional burden represented by the requirements now put forward. We should,therefore, press them strongly to bring over additional construction troops as quickly as possible in order to make about 15,000 additional men available from october onwards. This would provide for United States Air Force requirements as in paragraph 2 (6) above, with some margin also for Army requirements. the americans will probably reply that these measures will correspondingly reduce the build-up of their combatant troops in this country and some wide generalimplications are therefore involved.O. L.Ministry of Production, S. W. 1,15 &amp; july, 1943.
