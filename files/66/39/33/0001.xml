THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943Copy No.WAR CABINET.CIVIL AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.OAT the 24th June the Cabinet invited me to assume responsibility for theforthcoming Conference and inter-Dominion discussions so far as the UnitedKingdom Government is concerned, as well as&apos; for the Co-ordination ofGovernment policy. I was also invited to take under review at a later stage, inconsultation with the Committee on the Machinery of Government, thedepartmental organisation and Ministerial responsibility for post-war civilaviation matters; and, in particular, whether any changes should be made beforehostilities cease.2. I have, during the last month, had an opportunity of looking into thepresent organisation, and I am driven to the conclusion that the present machineryapproved by the Cabinet is quite unequal to the needs, not only of the future, but even of the present.3. What is the history of this vexed question 1 The reconstruction problems Committee, first under Mr. Greenwood and then under sir William Jowitt, gave very considerable attention to civil air transport aspart of their task. But it became evident that this Committee had neither theauthority nor the time to deal with a problem with such vast ramifications,though they did most valuable work in appointing a number of official bodies,including the Shelmerdine Committee, the Finlay Committee and the BarlowCommittee, to investigate and report on various aspects of civil air transport policy.4. The situation, however, remained unsatisfactory, and it was, I take it,because of this fact that responsibility for co-ordinating policy was entrusted tome. But what I think was not realised by the Cabinet I did not realise itmyself until I looked into it is that a much more radical reform of themachinery is required. I find myself in much the same position as mypredecessors, Mr. Greenwood and Sir William Jowitt. I am not the head ofan executive department. I am merely the Chairman of a Ministerial Committee,the whole of the executive machinery of Civil Aviation being in the departmentof another Minister, the Secretary of State for Air, who exercises practicalcontrol through the Director-General of Civil Aviation, an official of the AirMinistry whose responsibility necessarily is to his own Minister. I say this inno spirit of criticism of the Air Ministry, but merely as a self-evident fact.5. That is, I submit, an impossible position. I am already convinced, asa result of my short experience, that the problem of post-war civil air transportcan never receive adequate consideration on the basis of its being no more thana part-time charge of a Minister, the majority of whose time and attention istaken up with other entirely different responsibilities.   , .6. For Civil Air Transport is a vast subject, especially as it has alreadybecome clear to me that the two stages into which the Cabinet divided the workto be done first, preparations for an International Conference, and later, thedepartmental organisation and- Ministerial responsibility for post-war Aviationmatters- cannot, in practice, be so separated in point of time. At the sametime as the question of the International Conference is being studied, we should[25807]SECRET.W.P. (43) 333.23rd July, 1943.
be preparing our post-war set-up, for Home, Commonwealth and Empire and international operations; settling what is to be the nature of our airlines;whether they are to be State or privately owned; whether there shall be in anyease some public machinery to co-ordinate and license them; how far subsidieswill be necessary; what Minister will be ultimately responsible for Civil air transport; what will be the relationship of United Kingdom airlines to Dominionairlines, what is to be the relationship of airlines to shipping lines, and so on.There is also the Security aspect.7. These and other most difficult questions must all have a bearing on thenature of any international machinery to which we can agree in forthcominginternational negotiations. They are also questions regarding which bothHouses of Parliament have already pressed, and will press even more strongly in the immediate future, for some declaration of Government policy. Theyinvolve a great mass of work, of discussions not only with existing British,Commonwealth and Indian civil airlines, but with, rail, shipping and other civiltransport interests, with the great aircraft construction firms, with the treasury and other Departments concerned. They constitute very much an all-time job.Eor a part-time Minister like myself to attempt to deal with so vast a question at odd moments between the War Cabinet, the business of the House of Lords,the Lord Presidents Committee, and other quite unallied Ministerial activities,is bound to lead to failure. - The responsible Minister must soak himself in thesubject. Many of these questions are, indeed, already being studied by the CivilAviation Department of the Air Ministry. But this department is, as I have explained, responsible, not to the Chairman of the Ministerial Committee, but,to the Secretary of State Tor Air. There is, therefore, inevitably, dividedresponsibilty for policy. To continue on such a basis is, I am sure, merelytinkering with the problem, and can only lead to continued delay and friction.8. I am therefore convinced that the only satisfactory way of ensuring the effective formulation and direction of post-war civil air transport policy is eitherto hand hack entire responsibility for policy to the Secretary of State for Air,who would become the Chairman of the Ministerial Committee, or to appoint awhole-time Minister to devote his entire attention to this question, and to transfer to him that portion of the Staff of the Civil Aviation Department of the AirMinistry which deals with post-war aspects of air transport. I recognise theproblem involved in the separation of the war-time and post-war aspects of civilaviation, but this should surely not be insuperable.9. Such an appointment must not be taken as prejudging the issue as tothe ultimate place of Civil Air Transport in the post-war Ministerial set-up.The Minister I propose would certainly have this within his purview. It would clearly be his duty to examine and recommend whether Civil Air transport should be permanently a separate Ministry, or a department of a transport ministry, reconstituted from the present Ministry of War Transport, or, as now,a department of the Air Ministry. His task would, in fact, be to bridge the gap between war and peace so that the cross-over may be made safely, swiftlyand certainly, in accordance with carefully and methodically prepared plans.I am convinced that there must be some Minister with undividedresponsibility for the direction of policy on this question, whether he be theSecretary of State for Air or another, such as I have suggested. I see no other way of avoiding the inefficiency, delay and muddle which is bound .to result from a continuation of the present machinery.&apos;   -     .
