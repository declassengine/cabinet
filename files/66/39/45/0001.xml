(43) 345.30th July, 1943.SECRET.Copy No.WAR CABINET.INDIA&apos;S REQUIREMENTS OF IMPORTED FOOD GRAINS.Report by the Shipping Committee.1. The Shipping Committee have had under review a request made bythe Government of India, with personal support from the Viceroy and Com-mander-in-Chief, for 500,000 tons of wheat to be imported from September toFebruary inclusive.The representations made in support of this request, and the probable effects of granting the request, are summarised belowr. The Committee submit, for decision by the War Cabinet, the question of how much shipping, if any, shouldbe allocated to meet this demand.2. The particulars furnished by the Government of India in support of their request are, briefly, as follows : Their latest investigation into the grains position as a whole shows thatthere is likely to be a deficit for the fiscal year 1943-44 of the order of1 - 35 million tons between the estimated surpluses likely to be secured throughGovernment procurement and the estimated needs of Provinces, Indian Statesand the Defence Services. This deficit in itself is only a small proportion of thetotal production, which amounts to some 50 million tons, but many millions ofsmall producers are largely self-suppliers, and the quantity which is marketedis appreciably less than half the total production; there are already signs that difficulty is likely to arise in the non-rural and industrial districts, and in keeping the Armed Forces supplied, unless steps can be taken to ensure an adequate flow of food grains from cultivators.At present the cultivators are continuing to hold stocks in the anticipation of an increase in prices (based partly on the conviction that there is an enormousdrain on India&apos;s resources for the defence services), and (in parts of theEastern area) in fear of Japanese invasion. To some extent also, they areinfluenced by the fact that, owing to high prices for the produce which they dosell and the lack of purchasable goods, they lack incentive to sell more thanenough to cover their fixed charges; further, a not unnatural sense of insecuritycreates a tendency to play for safety in estimating how much to retain for theirown requirements. Attempts are being made to make dealers and other largeholders disb.oa.rd, but the Government of India say that such attempts do nottouch the root of the problem that is, the question of securing the release ofthe holdings of millions of small cultivators and they are convinced that theonly solution is to arrange for substantial imports of grains, and for a public announcement to be made that enough wheat will be imported into India tosatisfy all reasonable requirements of the population. It is argued that sucha step alone is likely (i) to effect reduction in prices, and (ii) thereby to draw outaccumulated stores of food grains by encouraging holders to dispose of thesestores at once, instead of keeping them in the hope of further appreciation inmarket prices.The Government of India state that the results of food shortage on the scaleanticipated would include the following : (a) Internal disorder and strain, involving an adverse effect on morale, andalso involving a call on the Defence Services for assistance.(6) Further increases in the price of food grains, which would react on otherprices and would help towards inflation.[25847]
(c) The danger that workers will leave the towns.(d) The harmful effect on munitions production, caused by the necessity, forexample, of operators having to spend lengthy periods in food queues.The Commander-in-Chief has given a formal intimation to the Viceroy that,in view of the risks of civil disobedience and the effect of food shortage upon themovement of labour, his considered opinion is that India&apos;s military effort overthe next two years will be in serious danger unless the food problem is solved.It may be that if full publicity were given to the provision of shipping forgrain imports of a substantial amount, it would be possible to break the marketwithout actually importing large quantities of grains. A similar device wastried some months ago, however, and it will not be easy to bluff the cultivatorson this occasion. The Government of India urge that the full amount of500,000 tons should be programmed, on the understanding that the programme will be discontinued if the earlier imports achieve their purpose.It is anticipated that the import of grains will not be a continuingcommitment.The India Office state that it should be realised that famine conditions arealready reported as having begun to appear in some parts of India, namely,certain areas of Travancore, Cochin and Bengal. This being so. it must beapprehended that if the undertaking now asked for is not given, shipments,perhaps in larger quantities, may later become unavoidable, whatever theconsequences may be elsewhere, and meanwhile the structure upon which easternoperations from India must be based will have been irreparably damaged.3. The view was expressed by members of the Shipping Committee that thereal problem in India was one of inflation, of which food hoarding and the consequent shortage were symptomatic. They were informed that plans were afootto import gold and silver into India as a way of providing an alternative to thehoarding of grains, but the view of the Government of India was that it wouldbe some time before the import of precious metals could produce a favourableeffect upon the food situation. It was suggested by members of the Committeethat, if the present difficulties were staved off now by an importation of food,they would simply reappear at a later date unless the fundamental problems weretackled, and it was pointed out that the import of bullion was only one of anumber of measures for coping with inflation.In this connexion, the India Office state that it is known that the Govern-ment of India are already coping strenuously with inflation, though full particulars are not yet available. Information has already been received to theeffect that the measures which have been put into operation include creditrestriction, advance collection of E.P.T. on the basis of summary provisionalassessments, drastic overhaul of defence expenditure, efforts to make largersupplies of consumer goods available, and intensified savings propaganda. Theeffect of these measures cannot yet be ascertained. Should these and any other possible measures have the desired effect, the necessity for wheat imports mightbe proportionately reduced.4. The Shipping Committee have considered in some detail what the likelyrepercussions would be if the Indian request were granted in part or in full.Particulars are given in the Annex to this paper of certain additional demands which have been received, subsequent to the examination of world allied require-ments by the Washington Conference, for food-stuffs and fertiliser requirements in the Eastern Mediterranean and Indian Ocean Area for loading during theperiod August to December 1943. Urgent requests are also to be expected in thenear future from Australia, New Zealand and probably South Africa forincreased supplies of phosphates; these requests are likely to involve an additional demand on shipping from the Red Sea, North Africa or Florida, althoughshipping so employed might be utilised on the return journey from the southern dominions to carry wheat for India. The Committee must also emphasise thatthere may well be other competing demands for tonnage which have not yet been formulated.The demands from loading areas other than Australia could, if accepted, besatisfied without undue strain, with the present disposition of tonnage. Thedemands from Australia, however, amount to some 117,000 tons a month thatis some 80,000 tons a month to India for six months, 10,000 tons a month to theMiddle East, and 27,000 tons a month towards the requirements of Ceylon (whereit will be increasingly important to maintain supplies in order to procure themaximum output of natural rubber).   The Ministry of. War Transport advise
that, without a serious dislocation of our plans, it would not be possible to arrangeadditional British-controlled tonnage to lift an average of more than. 30,000 tonsa month from Australia, as against these total requirements of some 117,000 tonsa month.According to information supplied by the Ministry of Food, it appears that part of the difficulty might be met by shipping to India 100,000 tons of barleywhich is likely to become available in Iraq. The India Office anticipate thatbarley would be acceptable to the Government of India, but are making enquiriesby telegraph on this point.5. In considering possible means of bridging the remainder of the gap,attention was drawn to the following points (a) There is a possibility that the cargo available in North America duringthe remainder of this year may not be sufficient to load economicallyall the ships which under present dispositions would become availablefor loading in this area, and it may be thought reasonable, if sufficient importance and urgency are attached to the Indian demand, to forgo,in order to meet the demand, some of the tonnage which would ordin-arily become available for loading in North America.(b) It is not possible to form any reliable estimate of the effect whichfulfilment of the Indian demand would have on the United, kingdom import programme for 1943, but unless there were a large increase in military requirements becoming effective in 1943, it could hardly do more than involve some degree of interference with the re-establishmentof stocks in the United Kingdom contemplated by the War cabinet when they directed an import programme of 26 million tons for 1943.Alternatively, and more probably, the arrangements for meeting theIndian requirement would compete with operational demands whichhave yet to be formulated.(c) Any interference with the loadings from Australasia for the UnitedKingdom import programme as at present arranged for the latermonths of 1943 would cause serious difficulty. Stocks of crossbredwool are being heavily drawn upon, and in the case of zinc concentratesit is necessary to lift supplies i-egularly, as they become available.Conclusions.6. Whether the Indian demand should be met, in whole or in part, is aquestion clearly beyond the competence of the Shipping Committee to decide.Discussion at the Committee has shown that there is a wide divergence of opinon as to the part which the import of cereals should or could play in solving theIndian economic problem.If the decision of the War Cabinet is that part or whole of the demand shouldbe met, shipping could be found without undue strain to the extent that &apos;(a) out of the maximum of 30,000 tons a month which could be lifted from australia, some margin might be available for India, after meetingwhatever requirements for Ceylon and the Middle East might be judged to be necessary; and(&amp;) barley from Iraq, up to some 100,000 tons., might be shipped against this demand.On the best estimate that can be made, however, less than one-third of theIndian demand could be met in these ways. Consideration of the means ofproviding the remaining amount would necessitate a comprehensive review of requirements and tonnage prospects extending far into 1944. It would, be mis-leading to hinge such a review on a single claim for tonnage, but the main relevant considerations, so far as immediate shipping questions are involved, are sum-marised in paragraph 5.Signed on behalf of the Committee.HARCOURT JOHNSTONE,Chairman.Offices of the War Cabinet.

ANNEX.The Washington Conference examined world Allied requirements and tonnage against them for the remainder of 1943, and set out in detail the amountof tonnage required from United Kingdom and North America each month to theEastern Mediterranean and Indian Ocean Area. Since this review was made, anumber of additional demands for tonnage have been made, principally for food-stuffs and fertilisers.A summary of the principal additional demands is set out below : Consuming    !
