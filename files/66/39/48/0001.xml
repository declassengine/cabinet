t isSECRET. /V/ Copy No.   3 3W.P. (43) 348.30 th July, 1943.WAR CABINET.SHACKLING OF PRISONERS OF WAR.Note by the Prime Minister.I should like to propose to Mackenzie King and the President the following statement:- &quot;Although His Majesty&apos;s Government have now captured far more german prisoners-of-war than the enemy, the inhumane and insultingshackling of British and Canadian prisoners-of-war still continues, upwards of four thousand officers and men being daily subjected to this barbarousreprisal abhorrent to the customs of war. His Majesty&apos;s Government havedecided not to inflict similar retaliation during the war upon the german prisoners in their hands.- However, they wish to make it clear that a carefulrecord will be kept of the total number of man-days on which British and canadian prisoners are chained, and that they will require double this number of man-days to be served in chains by the Officer Corps of theGerman Army after the defeat and surrender of Germany has been achieved.&quot;I should be glad if my colleagues would consider this over the week-end.w. s. c.10 downing  Street, S.W. 1,30th July, 1943.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.
