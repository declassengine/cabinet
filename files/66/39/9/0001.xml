THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET. / Copy No.   83- /W.P. (43) 309.13th July, 1943. .WAR CABINET.REDUCTIONS OF MINISTRY OF SUPPLY MUNITIONSLABOUR FORCE.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.ON the basis of the decisions taken by the War Cabinet in December 1942[subsequently modified by the decision on the 21st April, 1943 W.M. (43)57th Conclusions to complete the programme of the reductions (viz., 120,000) by september 1943 instead of by the end of the year], reductions in the Ministry ofSupply munitions labour force have been made to the extent of 65,000 during the.first six months of 1943 as follows : JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJune- 65,000 netOn present planning it is estimated that further reductions- will be achieved : July   .     ...      ...      ...  ;  ...      ... 16,000August.........     ....       ... 18,000September............      ... 18,00052,000making in all a reduction of 117,000 by the end of September, thus virtuallyachieving the target required .under the terms of the War Cabinet decisionsreferred to. These reductions, based on revised programmes worked out in collaboration with the War Office, have been carefully planned in close co-opera-tion with the Ministries of Production and of Labour and National Service inorder to ensure that, as far as practicable, labour and capacity have been releasedwhere they are most needed, in so far as choice could be exercised.2. The experience gained in planning and carrying out these reductions hasshown that the process necessarily involves a heavy load of detailed work both at headquarters and Regionally. If planned reductions are to be made inaccordance with existing policy on an orderly basis, the limitations on the extent and speed with which further reductions can be achieved must be recognised. Asthe figures quoted above show, the highest monthly figure reached is 18,000 amonth, and this includes many of the reductions which are easiest to carry intoeffect. It is not possible to say how soon, within these limits and conditions, ahigher rate than 20,000 a month could be achieved in the immediate future; buta higher figm^e could, of course, be more quickly achieved if we were prepared totake risks of dislocation to the more essential parts of our programme of produc-tion, and of displacement of labour without its being likely to be re-engaged inother essential work except after a more or less prolonged interval.[25748]4-   4,000- 9,000- 17,000- 14,000- 13,000- 16,000
3. It was having regard to these considerations that I informed the WarCabinet at their meeting on the 9th of this month that it would not be reasonablywise to undertake an additional programme of reductions amounting to 110,000by the end of 1943.4. Preliminary consultations with the War Office have taken place since themeeting on the 9th July. The War Office cannot at this stage give a definiteassurance that they can reduce their requirements to the full extent necessary topermit labour savings on the scale suggested. They will, however, give further&apos;consideration to directions in which labour savings can best be achieved, and. Iam assured of their co-operation in carrying on the process of reduction in thelabour force employed on production for them. Some contribution towards these further reductions can also be obtained from the common services which theMinistry of Supply carry out for Departments other than the War Office, thoughthe extent of curtailment possible in this direction is more limited.5. On the assumption that cuts in requirements can be made to the necessaryextent, there is a reasonable hope of achieving the required further reduction of110,000 by the end of April 1944. Such a target would give us and the otherMinistries who are also concerned in the process an opportunity to avoid theserious dislocation and friction which would inevitably arise if we were to set out to attempt to achieve the earlier, and in my view not reasonably attainable,target date.A. P. D.Ministry of Supply, 13th July, 1943.
