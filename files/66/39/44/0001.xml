Prisoners were taken and the crews&quot;were sent back to Spain in another trawler.A large number of engagements by light coastal forces with enemy trawlers,minesweepers and E-boats took place during the week in the Channel and off theDutch coast. Hits were claimed on enemy ships and our forces sustained damage and casualties.On the 24th Norwegian-manned M.T.Bs., during an operation off theNorwegian coast, shot down one enemy aircraft and damaged two others.Fog caused dislocation of convoys during the night of 24th/25th off theWest Coast and five ships were damaged in collision.Mediterranean.4. On the night of the 20th/21st H.M.S. Quantock (destroyer), the GreekDestroyer A drias, and our light forces engaged E-boats off Augusta. On the 21stH.M. Ships Newfoundland (cruiser) and Erebus (monitor) bombarded troop concentrations and heavy batteries north of Catania. Taormina and Ripostowere also bombarded by light craft.H.M.S. Neivfoundland was torpedoed by U-boat off Syracuse on the 23rd.Her steering gear was destroyed but she reached Malta the same afternoon. ThisU-boat wras later sunk.U.S. ships entered Palermo harbour on the 25th. The port was slightly damaged and the harbour congested with sunken wrecks, but three ships&quot; and seven coasters can be berthed when tugs are available. The U.S. DestroyerMayrant was damaged by dive-bombing off the port on the 26th.Admirals Priamo Leonardi and Giuseppe Manfredi, the naval commandersat Augusta and Trapani respectively, have been taken prisoner.In the Straits of Messina there has been a ceaseless movement of enemy small craft engaged in carrying supplies. On the night of. the 28th H.M. S/MUnrivalled intercepted an E-boat from Trapani and took four prisoners.During the 21st, 4,400 tons of supplies were discharged on Porto Palo beach(C.

U.S. Naval aircraft possibly damaged aU-boat in the Central Caribbean.Enemy Intelligence.Italian.10. Photographic reconnaissance on the evening of the 26th showed aCavour class battleship at sea in the Gulf of Taranto. By the following morningshe had returned to Taranto.The Regolo class cruiser, last reported at Taranto, was again seen in Anconaon the 23rd.Japanese.11. Destroyers and small cargo ships, sometimes convoyed by cruisers, arebeing used by the Japanese to supply and reinforce their garrisons in New Georgiaand Kolombangara; but there are still no signs that heavy ships are being brought from Truk to the Solomons area in support of those outposts.U-boats. \12. There are about 80 U-boats at sea in the Atlantic and IndianOceans. The chief areas of activity are the coasts of West Africa and Brazil,the east coast of the U.S.A., the Caribbean, and the east coast of Africa.The Mediterranean remains quiet.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked three ships,two of which are known to have sunk. A U.S. tanker was torpedoed north-east of the Bahamas, a Dutch tanker was sunk in the Caribbean, and a British ship was sunk off Rio de Janeiro.Focke Wulf 200 made repeated attacks on two convoys off the Atlanticcoast of Spain. One ship of a convoy southbound from the United Kingdom was sunk and three others damaged west of Lisbon; and a homebound convoy was attacked off Cape Finisterre, but no ships were hit. Two F.W. 200&apos;s were destroyed by escorting Liberators (B. 24) and another damaged by twoHurricanes from catapult ships in the convoy, both the fighter pilots&quot; beino-successfully picked up.In the Mediterranean one ship was sunk off Syracuse.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14- During the week ending the 25th, 1,066 ships were convoyed. Of these,387 were in ocean convoys and 679 in British coastal convoys[25837] . B
Seventy-eight destroyers (including 12 U.S. Destroyers), 114 sloops, frigates,cutters and corvettes (including seven U.S. cutters and a French sloop), oneauxiliary aircraft-carrier, one escort carrier, and one ocean boarding vessel, were employed on escort duties.Four ocean convoys, consisting of 150 ships, arrived in Home Waters without loss.15. During the week ending the 24th, imports into the United kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 1,561,000 tons, compared with 1,030,000 tons duringthe previous seven days and an average of 1,026,800 tons during the past ten weeks.   Of the week&apos;s imports 650,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.British Minelaying.16. During the week surface craft laid mines off the Dutch coast. Aircraftlaid mines in the River Elbe and off the Frisian Islands.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.17. After an interval of nearly six weeks enemy aircraft are suspected of having laid mines on two nights of the week off the Yorkshire coast. There havebeen no reports of minelaying by surface craft.Ten ground mines have been destroyed off the East Coast and two in the mersey; nine moored mines in Lyme Bay and one off the south of Ireland (R.)The mine totals are 4,436 ground and 3,015 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.18. During the period the 16th-30th June eleven enemy ships totalling21,719 tons were sunk or captured and fopr ships totalling 18,500 tons were seriously damaged. Of these, six ships (18,597 tons) were sunk and three ships(16,000 tons) seriously damaged in the Mediterranean.The diversion of traffic from Rotterdam has been maintained, and whilstactive shipping at Emden is 75 per cent, above the level of last July, activity at rotterdam appears now to be stabilised at one-third of that of July 1942, whenthe average tonnage present was about 100,000 tons. Cranes used for handlingiron ore are being dismantled.It is reported that, owing to German financial difficulties, shipments of iron ore and of lemons from Spain to the enemy have been suspended. Since the com-pletion of the orange season in May some 14,000 tons of lemons had been shipped.Japanese.19. During the past six months there has been a further decline in the size of the Japanese Mercantile Marine. After allowing for the requisitioning ofcommercial tankers for service with the fleet, the tanker tonnage is only justsufficient to cover essential movements of oil. If the current rate of sinkings ismaintained no appreciable increase in the size of the tanker fleet can be antici-pated. The Mercantile Marine is fully extended carrying the food.and rawmaterials needed for Japan&apos;s present industrial capacity, and it is estimated thatthere is only a margin of 500,000 tons available for moving military forces and supplies.. This is considered barely sufficient, having regard to the number oftroops abroad, and continued sinkings at the rate of recent months will lead to a diversion of shipping from trade, particularly, that engaged in carrying rice andother raw materials. Eventually wooden ships now projected may replace part ofthis tonnage.MILITARY SITUATION.Sicily.    (An outline map of Sicily is included as an inset.)20. The whole of Southern and Western Sicily is now in Allied hands and itis only in the north-east corner that resistance continues. It became obvious atan early stage that the Germans intended to form their main defensive positions on a line running from Catania north-westwards through Troina to the coast, andit is here that the severest fighting has occurred throughout the campaign.The building up of reinforcements and supplies continued steadily throughthe ports and over the beaches. More than 68,000 prisoners have been taken, ofwhom 50,000 are claimed by the U.S. Forces.
Eighth A rmy.21. During the past week there was no appreciable change on the front,though there were indications that the Germans were feeling the effects of our air superiority. Fierce fighting occurred, interspersed with periods of considerablepatrol activity. German counter-attacks have been repulsed with heavy losses tothe enemy, and British forces have been engaged in consolidating their gains,regrouping and making local advances. In the Catania plain British forwardpositions are on the line of the Dittaino River and at certain points patrols have crossed the Simeto River. Further north-west fighting was fierce and confused inextremely difficult hill country, enemy tanks were used in counter-attacks and places changed hands several times before being finally secured. The Canadianscaptured Leonforte on the 22nd and Assoro the same night, though much hinderedby demolitions. Missoria fell on the 23rd. British troops cut the road east ofAgira on the 24th, but were counter-attacked and forced to withdraw, and it wasnot until the 28th that Allied troops surrounded and entered the town. heavy fighting continued.Seventh A rmy.22. Meanwhile the Seventh Army have swept all before them in a virtuallyunopposed advance through the west of the Island. Palermo was entered, on the22nd and Trapani and Marsala on the following day. This Army is now engagedin occupying the whole of the west of the Island and also advancing eastwards.On the 28th they were within four miles of San Stefano on the north coastalroad, and further south captured Nicosia.The Russo-German Campaign.Leningrad Sector.23. Since the 22nd the Russians have made local attacks south of lake ladoga.Orel Sector.24. In their attack towards Orel from the north the Russians occupiedBolkhov on the 22nd and pushed on to the south-west in an attempt to cut therailway Orel-Bryansk. Early reports conflicted as to the success of this thrustbut it would appear that if Russian advance elements did reach the railway theywere unable to maintain themselves there. At the moment this vital Germansupply line remains intact.Further east the Russians have advanced down the railway Mtsensk-Orel to within nine miles of Orel. Due east of Orel the Russians have made steady progress in their advance along the railway Yelets-Orel and by the 21st theywere within ten miles of Orel.South of Orel the Russians have also made progress and on the 24th theycaptured Zmievka 22 miles south-east of Orel.Byelgorod Sector.25. The Russians continued their advance from the north towards Byelgorodand by the 23rd they claimed to have driven the Germans back to the originalline of the 5th July. Since the 23rd there has been only local activity in this sector.Donets-Mius Front.26. The Russians have kept up their reconnaissance thrusts in strength inthe area south of Isyum and near Kuibyshevo (40 miles north of Taganrog)?Taman Bridgehead.only27&apos; fighting in the Taman Bridgehead has been of local importanceBurma.28. In the Arakan a successful patrol action was fought on the 17th-18thnear Maungdaw in which the Japanese suffered, over 60 killed and wounded - our casualties were three.[25837] B 2
Pacific Area.New Guinea.29. Australian forces made further advances towards Komiatum, which lies on the main track between Salamaua and Mubo. On the 16th/17th theycaptured dominating positions on Mount Tambu, about two miles east ofKomiatum, which have been held in face of counter-attacks. Between the 16thand 20th the Japanese suffered 282 casualties, largely owing to their method ofbunched attacks against well fortified positions. A number of Japanese Com-manders have been replaced, and captured documents indicate that the japanese are perturbed at the deterioration of the fighting quality- of their troops inthis area.Solomons.30.   U.S. forces are continuing to close in on Munda airfield in New Georgiaand are now within about 500 yards of it.   It is thought that the supply positionof the Japanese garrison of New Georgia may now be serious.AIR SITUATION.General Review.31. Bomber Command aircraft made two heavy attacks on Hamburg andone on Essen.Aircraft of the U.S. VIHth Air Force operated on a large scale against targets in North-West and Central Germany.Enemy communications were attacked in Sicily. In Italy, railway centres and airfields wrere bombed.United Kingdom.32. -In daylight only four enemy reconnaissance aircraft crossed our coast.At night 36 enemy aircraft were reported overland. Fifteen of these operatedover a fairly wide area of the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire, and asimilar number penetrated over Essex and Kent. Five enemy aircraft were shot down.Coastal Operations.33. Very little enemy shipping has been sighted and the only attacksreported resulted in serious damage to two armed trawlers and the sinking at night, by Naval Albacores, of one R-boat, serious damage to another, and probabledamage to two more R-boats and a minesweeper.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 46 were despatched, laid 193 sea-mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.34. A total of 1,242 aircraft of the LT.S. VIIIth  Air Force was despatchedand operated as follows : (i) On the 24th, when the Heroya Alumina and Aluminium works nearLarvik (Norway) and the port area at Trondheim were attacked. At the former,370 tons of bombs were dropped and, at the latter, 92 tons. Bombing at bothplaces was reported as good and results are referred to in Appendix VI.(ii) On the 25th, when 67 aircraft attacked the Heinkel factory atWarnemunde and 51 the Blohm and Voss U-boat building yards at Hamburg.Small-scale attacks were made on the seaplane base at Wustrow (W. of Rostock)and on the Klockner aero engine factory in the suburbs of Hamburg.(iii) On the 26th, when the Blohm and Voss yards were again attacked,112 tons of bombs being dropped. In the two raids on this target, considerable damage was done (see Appendix VI). A small force again attacked the Klocknerfactory. At Hanover, 186 tons were dropped on the Continental tyre and rubberfactory and on the adjoining synthetic rubber processing works (see Appendix VI).(iv) On the 28th, the targets were the Fieseler fighter aircraft componentfactory at Kassel, upon which 107 tons of bombs were dropped with &quot; fair togood &apos;&apos; results, and the Ago fighter aircraft assembly factory at Oschersleben(nearMagdeburg). The latter target, which necessitated the deepest penetrationinto Germany yet made by U.S. heavy bombers, was attacked by 28 aircraft.
From the above operations, 67 Fortresses (B. 17) are missing; provisionalenemy casualties are 165 destroyed, 68 probably destroyed and 54 damaged. Inaddition, fighters supplying withdrawal cover destroyed nine enemy aircraft forthe loss of one Spitfire.Escorted Bostons (A. 20), Venturas (B. 34) and Mitchells (B. 25) of the tactical Air Force, and Marauders (B. 26) of the U.S. VIIIth  Support Commandoperated on 15 occasions, a total of 272 aircraft being despatched. industrial targets attacked were the coke ovens at Ghent and two attacks each on the Fokkeraircraft factory at Amsterdam and the coke ovens and benzol plant at Zeebrugge.At Amsterdam, a good concentration of bursts was seen in the target area andothers near the electric power station. At Zeebrugge, bombs which straddled thebenzol plant were followed by a sheet of flame. Airfields attacked includedAmsterdam/Schipol (twice), St. Omer, Courtrai/Wevelghem and Tricqueville.One Boston was lost on these operations. Cover and diversionary sweeps were supplied by 152 squadrons of fighters which destroyed 21 enemy aircraft and damaged others; 12 Allied fighters are missing.Two pairs of Bostons (A. 20) made effective low-level attacks on power stations at Langerbrugge (near Ghent) and Schelle (near Antwerp). At theformer, the main building appeared to be destroyed, and photographs confirm the latter target to have been hit.A total of 64 fighters, which included Hurricanes armed with 40-mm. cannonsoperating for the first time from this country, was despatched against transporttargets in Belgium and Northern France; three locomotives were destroyed anda further 24 and several barges damaged.Escorted Typhoon bombers attacked airfields at Woensdrecht (near Antwerp),Merville, Courtrai, Abbeville and Coxyde: At the first three targets, hits were seen on hangars and buildings.Night.35. Bomber Command aircraft operated in force against the followingtargets: Date.	Target.	Tonnage of Bombs.	Aircraft Despatched.	Attacked Primary Target.	Aircraft Missing.	Aircraft Crashed.24th/25th 25th/26th 27th/28th	Hamburg Essen... Hamburg	2,319 1,948 2,313	791 705 787	728 599 721	12 24 18	4 1All these attacks are considered to have been extremely successful, and photo-graphic evidence of the results of the first raid on Hamburg and of the raid onEssen are referred to in Appendix VI. Full coverage of the former target hasbeen hampered by smoke from fires which are still burning. The tonnage dropped in both attacks on Hamburg was higher than on any previous raid. The total of54 aircraft missing represents a percentage of 2-36 to the number of aircraft dispatched, a figure considerably lower than has been recently experienced overheavily defended areas.Small-scale attacks by Mosquitoes of Bomber Command were made on severaltowns in North-West Germany and the Ruhr.&quot; Intruder &quot; aircraft attacked airfields in North-West Germany, the low countries and France and destroyed four enemy aircraft; two Mosquitoes are missing.North Italy.36. On the night of 24th/25th, 33 Lancasters, returning to this country from north Africa, dropped 83 tons of bombs on Leghorn. Large fires were seen in and around the railway centre and near the docks.Mediterranean.Italy.37. Operations were on a somewhat less intensive scale than in the previoustwo weeks; the main attacks were concentrated on enemy railway centres and airfields.
Over 70 Fortresses (B. 17) dropped 187 tons of bombs on Foggia, with theresult that the goods station was gutted, the workshops and car sheds covering8 acres were devastated, 3^ acres of the railway centre and a large quantity of rolling-stock were completely destroyed and severe damage was caused to factories adjoining the railway. Salerno marshalling yard was bombed by85 Marauders (B. 26) by day and by a similar number of Wellingtons at night and was rendered unserviceable. The railway centres at Bologna, Battipaglia,San Giovanni, Marina Di Paola, Marina Di Catanzaro Avere also successfully attacked and damaged.A heavy raid by 70 Fortresses (B. 17) was made on the airfield at Leverano(25 miles S.E. of Brindisi). Fairly strong enemy opposition was encountered and12 enemy fighters were shot down. Marauders (B. 26) with Lightning (P. 38)escort bombed Aquino airfield and destroyed at least 18 aircraft on the ground.Other airfields attacked were Scalea (81 miles N. of Cape Vaticano), which was rendered unserviceable and at least 10 aircraft were burnt out, Grosseto (80 miles .W. of Rome), Cotrone, Capua (60 miles E. of Naples), Capodichino and ReggioDi Calabria.Sicily and Malta.38. Concentrated attacks by light bombers based on Malta were made on enemy communications and junctions in Eastern Sicily. Over 200 sorties byBostons (A. 20) and Baltimores (A. 30) were made in one day against Regalbuto,where numerous hits were observed on road junctions and on the town. other centres attacked were Randazzo, Misterbianco, Adrano, Agira and Cerami. Theport and harbour installations at Milazzo were seriously damaged and an oil refinery was set on fire.Fighter-bombers carried out offensive reconnaissances, during one of which65 M.T. vehicles were destroyed or damaged on the road between Randazzo andTroina.Enemy opposition was on a very small scale. One squadron of Spitfiresoperating over Messina area intercepted 30 Ju. 52 with fighter escort and shot down 21 Ju. 52 and six of the fighters for the loss of one Spitfire. Night fighters destroyed nine enemy aircraft off the coast of Sicily.Malta was unsuccessfully attacked at night by 25 enemy bombers, seven ofwhich were shot down.Sardinia.39. Two offensive sweeps were flown by war hawks (P. 40 F). The railway station at La Maddelena was attacked, factories at Villasore (18 miles N.N.W. ofCagliari) v^ere set on-fire and 22 enemy aircraft were shot down for the loss oftwo war hawks (P. 40 F).A attacks on Shipping.40. North of Elba, Wellingtons torpedoed amidships a ship of 4,000 tons.An escorted convoy was attacked S.E. of Naples, resulting in one ship being sunk,another probably sunk, and a destroyer and an escort vessel being set on fire.Beaufighters torpedoed and blew up a ship of 1,500 tons and sank a schoonerand a barge west of Naples.Three Beaufighters and two Wellingtons are missing.Crete.41. Eight Baltimores (A. 30), seven Beaufighters and 105 Hurricanes andSpitfires of the R.A.F. and Royal Hellenic Air Force attacked enemy forces and installations in Crete. Five Baltimores (A. 30) and 13 Hurricanes failed toreturn.Battle Casualties and Sorties.42. During the week ended the 27th July 101 enemy aircraft were shot down; 47 Allied aircraft are missing.  A total of 7,399 sorties were flown.Russia.43. The Soviet Air Force was actively engaged in support of advancingground forces in the areas north, east and south of Orel.    The Russians
claim to have destroyed by fighter defence and. A.A. fire over 900 German aircraft in this area from the beginning of their offensive on the 10th July to the 22nd Julyinclusive. They do not specify their own losses, but there seems no doubt thatthe Soviet Air Force is continuing to hold its own against the G.A.F. in this area.In general German Air Force activity is thought to have been limitedthroughout Russia, and it seems possible that units may be having difficulty inrecovering from the heavy wastage incurred during the intensive operations at thebeginning of the German offensive.Burma.44. In the North, Kittyhawks (P. 40) attacked numerous targets^ in theMyitkyina area. Two hits were made on a bridge at Namti, another at Nsopzup(30 miles N. of Myitkyina) was destroyed, and a third at Tiangzup was damaged.Buildings at Sumprabum and Mogaung were destroyed.Further South, in the Katha area, heavy bombers attacked Wuntho and Naba,and Mitchells (B. 25) destroyed a warehouse at Kyaikthin and damaged sevenlocomotives and 80 trucks on the railway between Monywa and Katha.In Central Burma, medium bombers attacked Myingyan (68 miles S.W. of Mandalay) where goods sheds and an ammunition dump were destroyed, and. also bombed Meiktila and the riverside at Mandalay. Heavy bombers raided Monywaand railway targets at Ywataung and Sedaw.In the Mayu Peninsula area, Hurricanes and Blenheims attacked huts, rivercraft and troop concentrations and bombed the town of Buthidaung. &quot;Wellingtonsand Liberators (B. 24) made two attacks on Akyab.Attacks on shipping on the rivers Irrawaddy, Chindwin and Kaiadan, andoff the Arakan coast, resulted in the destruction of, or damage to, about 200 small craft.China Zone.45. Liberators (B. 24) bombed Hongay and the cement plant at Haiphong(French Indo-China).Escorted enemy bombers attacked Hengyang (360 miles N.N.W. of HongKong) and Lingling (320 miles N.N.W. of Hong Kong). Kittyhawks (P. 40)intercepted and destroyed 20 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 21 and damagedsix; two Kittyhawks (P. 40) are missing. Seven out of eight enemy fighterswhich attempted to attack Kweilin (350 miles N.W. of Hong Kong) were alsodestroyed.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.46. Targets in the Bogadyim area (near Madang) were attacked on fouroccasions by a total of 94 escorted heavy and medium bombers; in combat, 25enemy aircraft were destroyed and others damaged for the loss of three allied aircraft.In the Lae/Salamaua area, enemy camps near Komiatum were attacked by 70Allied bombers and, in addition. 15 heavies bombed targets on the banks of theMarkham River; 24 heavies attacked Salamaua airfield and nearby targets.Eighteen enemy aircraft were destroyed in thisOff Finschhafen, attacks on barges resulted in the destruction of two and theprobable destruction of nine more.Enemy activity consisted of ineffective attacks on Bulolo (110 miles N. of port Moresby) and on Allied positions in the Bena Bena and Nassau Bay areas.New Britain.47. Mitchells (B. 25) destroyed 11 barges and probably destroyed a furthereight, on the Itne River.New Ireland.48. Escorted Allied bombers attacked a 9,000 ton sea-plane tender (probably the Nisshin) and four destroyers off Cape St. George; the sea-plane tender was sunk, a destroyer damaged arid five enemy aircraft shot down for the loss of twoAllied fighters.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in June 1943 these comprised 35 tankers of 274,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3)).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not.therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other, than United Kingdom and Eire.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Germany.Wuppertal. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the25th July shows that as a result of the attack on the 24th/25th June almost thewhole of the Elberfeld part of the town has been destroyed or very severely damaged. A number of industrial plants has suffered heavily and more than half of the works of the I.G. Farbenindustrie Werk (first priority) has been destroyed. Among essential buildings, the main railway station and theBahnhof Steinbech have been severely damaged, while damage to public,commercial and residential buildings is very widespread and severe.Cologne. A further interpretation of photographs covering the districtson the west bank of the river shows that as a result of the attacks on the28th/29th June and the 3rd/4th July, and including damage still remaining fromprevious attacks, nearly 60 per cent, of this area has been devastated. Of thecentral city area, over 80 per cent, has been destroyed. The main business andshopping centre has been ruined, and amongst the more important buildingsdestroyed or severely damaged are the town hall, the railway inspectorate, the municipal power station, the railway management offices and the main post and telegraph office. Nine factories in various districts have been damaged, including three machinery firms and an electric motor works, while in Sulz six others,spread over an area of 80 acres, have been almost totally destroyed. Many huttedcamps and barracks have been affected, and damage to railway property involves the Gereon and Eifeltor marshalling yards, the main railway station, the Bonntorgoods station, the Hafen Bahnhof at Mannsfeld, and many track and wagons.Of residential property, it is estimated that over 63,000 house units have&apos; been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable.The Westdeutscher Beobachter of the 2nd July gives considerable indication of the severe effect caused by the raid of the 28th/29th June :- (i) &quot; The head of the local A.R.P. calls attention to the fact that, withinthe Hansa city of Cologne, the beginning of the alert will for thepresent be indicated by two short bursts of Flak fire. The all-clearwill be given by shining the searchlights over the town, the beamsbeing held stationary for a time on a fixed point.&quot;(ii) Postal delivery services would be resumed on the 2nd July and it was hoped to resume parcel deliveries on the 3rd July.(iii) Tramway services to a limited extent would be resumed on the 2nd July.From a study of the services to operate it can be seen that servicesthrough the heart of the city were still unable to function, for example,Service No. 1 which ran from the suburb of Lindenthal on the west of the city, passed the Opera. House and then through the centre ofthe city via the Cathedral Square, across the Rhine to Kalk, was onlyto run as far as the Opera House.(Note. -Cologne was again attacked on the 3rd/4th July.)Huls. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 24th July(32 days after the attack by the U.S.A.A.F. on the synthetic rubber plant) confirms the considerable damage believed to have been caused from a study of the photo-graphs taken during the time of the attack. Notwithstanding, the interval, onlyone of the five boiler-house chimneys was smoking, and not one of the coolingtowers was in use. Assessment of damage is hampered by the camouflage of theworks, but it is seen that six gas holders have exploded and other vital parts of theworks have been affected.The Ruhr. On the 24th July partial cover of Gelsenkirchem, Bochum andMiilheim was obtained. An immediate interpretation shows that in each of these three places the branches of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke are seen to have been damaged, the most severe being that to the branch at Mulheim, where more than two acres of the main workshops have been gutted and several of the smaller[25837] D
buildings entirely destroyed. In addition, five buildings in the iron foundry atMulheim have been destroyed or damaged, and the damage in the town is heavy and concentrated. The main railway station buildings have been completely destroyed and much of the business and residential property in the town centrehas been devastated.dusseldorf. After the heavy attack on the 11th/12th June it was 16 days before the railway services returned to normal.Hamburg. Photographs taken on the 26th July, after the R.A.F. attack onthe 24th/25th July and the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 25th and 26th July coveronly the western part of Hamburg, the districts of Altona and Harburg-Wilhelmsburg and the greater part of the port, and even this area is partlyobscured by the smoke of fires still burning. Very great destruction is seen inthe parts covered. Industrial damage is very severe, particularly in the works of Blohm &amp; Voss, where the boiler house and power station and many shops havebeen affected, and in Howraldtswerke.The Neuhofer power station and oil stores between Ross Hafen and NeuhoferSeeschiff Kanai, and the nearby railway sidings have been damaged, as have many other industrial plants and commercial buildings. Residential damage is verygreat and among public buildings which have been hit are : The Main Railway Station at Altona,The Rathaus AltonaThe Reichsbank Directorate.Two M/Vs in the port are seen to be on fire.An&apos; immediate interpretation of further photographs, taken on the27th July, which cover the whole city except for a small area on the Easternoutskirts, show that in the town itself damage is very heavy, especially in alldistricts west of Aussen Alster. There is one area of almost complete devasta-tion between the Main Station at Altona and Adolph Strasse, and another in thevicinity of Eimsbutteler Chausee. There are many points of damage furthereast, and over four acres of warehouses in Hansa Hafen have been completely destroyed. The two main gas holders in the Municipal Gas Works have also been destroyed.In the dock area the damage to Blohm and Voss and Howaldtswerke is confirmed.Essen. On photographs taken on the day following the attack on the25th/26th July a heavy pall of smoke, drifting N.N.W. from large fires still burning west of the main railway station, obscures almost the whole of theKrupps Works. In the southern part of the works, however, where the smokeis less dense, damage is seen to be concentrated and heavy. A large machine shop,three rolling mills, two finishing shops, two engineering shops and severalfoundries are amongst buildings severely damaged. In addition, there is an areaof almost complete devastation N. and S. of the railway line, including wood-working shops, a power station, store shops, and several workers&apos; huts.In the main station the light -railway workshop and goods depot are severely damaged by fire.Hanover. Photographs taken on the 27th July after the U.S.A.A.F. raidon the 26th July show that three buildings of the Continental Gummiwerke A.G.in Vahrenwalderstrasse, the largest tyre factory in Germany and a priority 1target, have been partly destroyed and many other buildings damaged. Anotherbuilding belonging to the same concern at Nordhafen has been half destroyed.The main building, 1,220 feet x 300 feet, of the main goods yards has receivedseveral direct hits, and is seriously damaged, while a row of adjoining goods shedshave been destroyed over an area of 4,700 square yards. Many hits on railway lines have destroyed at least 12 trucks. Other industrial damage includes severaldirect hits on four buildings of the Gebr Korting Maschinenbau and ApparatebauA.G., makers of internal-combustion engines.Damage to residential property is slight.Rerik/West Airfield. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 26th July after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 25th July show that two largehangars (320 feet x 160 feet) at the eastern end of the airfield have been severely damaged by direct hits. Another large hangar at the south-east corner and fiveother buildings have been damaged, and, in addition, at least five buildings in alarge group of barracks have suffered severely.
Italy.Rome. The train in which the informant was travelling to Rome on the19th July &quot;was at Bologna re-routed via the coast route and arrived at the Traste-vere station. The main station was not usable. Casualties among Italianairmen at Littorio and German airmen at Ciampino airfields were heavy and abarracks at San Lorenzo used by the Germans as a local headquarters was destroyed. The destruction of the aqueduct near San Lorenzo left that district and Nomentana without water. In the confusion after the bombing there were several incidents in which Germans were killed and the majority of the popula-tion spent the night in Borghese Park and other open spaces near the Vatican.On his departure from the Trastevere Station on the 20th July the crowds andconfusion were unbelievable. There was no food or water on the station or in the train.  No porters were available and the train left five hours late.Turin-. The attack on the night of the 12th/T3th was the heaviest yetexperienced. On the 15th some fires were still burning owing to the great shortageof water. Train movement was considerably restricted. The area immediatelynorth of the main station suffered in particular, and damage to private propertythere was very heavy. Some 45 industrial concerns altogether were damaged.Among the most important damage was the destruction of the engine plant and warehouses at the Snia Viscosa artificial silk works, where the total damage isestimated to be 12 million lire.Bologna. Photographs taken after the attack on the 24th July show severe damage in the marshalling yards and railway junction. Across the central partof the yard tracks have been broken and numerous trucks derailed or destroyed.The lines from east to west have been cut at several points and the main line north from the centre of the yard has been blocked. The northern loop line skirtingthe town has been damaged, and there are hits on railways, workshops, sheds and storage pumps in the north and south corners of the yard.There is also damage to factory buildings and sheds in the vicinity of the yard.Transformer Stations. The attack on transformer stations on the night ofthe 15th/16th July caused some panic in Genoa, Parma and the Bologna areas.As a result certain civilians have been evacuated from these towns to places inthe country. The transformer station at Cislago, about 16 kms. west of Milanwas severely damaged.Sicily.Messina. Photographs taken on the 6th July after the attacks on the27th/28th, 28th/29th and 29th/30th June show that the main building ofthe central railway station has again been hit. Six sheds co the north-west of the marshalling yard have been destroyed and a number of residential blocks in thearea have been damaged. At the south end of the marshalling yard a multi-bayfactory building 450 ft. x 250 ft. has been badly damaged. In the south-westpart of the town one barrack block of the artillery barracks has been hit andthere is much damage to residential property.The 450 ft. M/V which was previously reported on fire in the port hasnow sunk.France.St. Omer. Photographs taken after the attacks on the 9th and 10th july show that in the railway yards the engine round house has been damaged at bothends by direct hits. In the aero engine repair shops nearby, the main buildinghas been severely damaged by at least eight direct hits, and there is also severe damage to the boiler house and the administrative offices.Nantes/Bougon. The raid by the U.S.A.A.F. on the 4th July has been very effective. Some of the undamaged machinery from the S.N.C.A.C.A. aircraft factory has been transferred to Toulouse.As a result of the same raid the workshops along road N.23 were almostentirely destroyed. It is said that more than 20 H.E. 111 which were awaitingdelivery after being repaired suffered complete destruction. All telegraphcommunications were cut off for 24 hours and the H/T cable along road 23 wasalso cut for a time.   Gas and oil containers were destroyed.
Norway.Trondheim. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the24th July after the U.S.A.A.F. attack earlier in the day shows that nearly thewhole weight of the attack fell on the north side of the Ladehammeren Basin.Smoke from fires still burning obscures a considerable area and many buildings are partly covered by smoke, but of the six workshops along the north quay threeare almost entirely gutted and the other three damaged. A large building near the north-east corner of the basin has been damaged and two more large buildingsnearby destroyed, while the gasworks appears to be on fire. The quays have been damaged in two places that on the eastern side having been burnt away forhalf its length, and part of the northern quay appears to have collapsed. ANarvik class destroyer standing away from the quay may well have been hit, anda small vessel alongside the destroyer has been damaged. A floating dock issubmerged at one end, a small M/V has received a direct hit and is down by thebows and several smaller craft have been sunk or have capsized.Heroya.
