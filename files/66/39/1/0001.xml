THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1943.ICopy No.W.P. (43) 301.12th July,-1943.WAR CABINET.BRITISH POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN view of difficulties which have recently arisen in our relations with united States representatives in the Middle East it ha,s been suggested that amemorandum should be prepared setting forth our general policy in the middle east for communication to the United States Government, and that we should endeavour to elicit from the latter whatever comments they may be disposed tomake. It is hoped that by discussing matters with complete frankness at a high level something may be done to mitigate the disagreements which have recentlyarisen and to co-ordinate British and American policy. The draft of such amemorandum is attached.2. It is difficult to say at present just what considerations are uppermostin the mind of the United States Government so far as the Middle East isconcerned. The Americans have already an interest in the oil of the persian gulf, and they possibly suspect the existence of oil in hitherto undeveloped partsof Saudi Arabia. In this connexion it is expected in&apos; some quarters that UnitedStates oil resources will, in a few years, cease to suffice for American needs; ifthis is so it explains an increasing American interest in the Persian Gulf. the americans already have a company working the oil-fields near Dhahran in saudi arabian territory on the Persian Gulf, and the Bahrein Petroleum Co., althoughtechnically British, is financed by American capital. They have shown a veryconsiderable interest recently in Saudi Arabia. A Legation has been established in Jedda for the first time, General Hurley has been to see Ibn Saud, and nowLieutenant-Colonel Hoskins is also to go, this time to discuss Palestine. Asuggestion by us to Ibn Saud that his requirements of arms should be stated inLondon rather than in Washington, owing to the existence of an unofficial under-standing between the British and American Munitions Assignment Boardregarding zones of responsibility for the supply of armaments, has caused acuriously strong reaction in the State Department; the latter somewhat flatlyinformed Ibn Saud that it was the policy of the United States Government toreceive applications for lease-lend armaments from Middle East countries direct.3. The Americans have recently suggested the appointment of a Consul atBahrein where a new refinery is being built as one of their tasks in the middle east. Owing to the relatively small number of American citizens involved andto our anxiety to exclude foreign consuls from Bahrein and thus avoid politicalcomplications there, we have turned down this suggestion and proposed various alternatives. But the pressure which the Americans have.brought to bear is another indication of their new interest in the Persi an Gulf now that Americanships go there constantly and that American troops are in Iraq and Persia.4. In Afghanistan also the Americans have recently appointed a Ministerfor the first time. The State Department, recently sent instructions to thisrepresentative to intervene in a manner highly prejudicial to our interests in negotiations which the Russians and ourselves were conducting with the AfghanGovernment regarding the subversive activities of certain persons financed by the axis Legations in Kabul,   Fortunately we were able, to get revised instructions12107   [25738]
sent to Kabul from Washington in time but the episode shows the need for theco-ordination of ideas with the State Department.5. As regards Persia, the Americans last year accused us of handling the persians in a manner likely to make the task of the United States advisers moredifficult and to prejudice the position of the Allies there. They thbught that wewere bringing unjustifiable pressure to bear on the Persian Government, andthey objected to our arrest of General Zahidi, Military Governor of Isfahan, forcomplicity in a pro-Axis plot. We had little difficulty in explaining our policy to the State Department, but co-operation with the Americans in Persia has not always gone smoothly and their Minister there seems, in spite of all efforts to gainhis confidence, to harbour suspicions of our real intentions, or at least to question the wisdom of our policy. These doubts are. unquestionably reflected in the state department.6. One of the American prejudices we have got to overcome is the feeling that Great Britain has exploited the Middle East territories for her ownimperialist ends and has retarded political progress contrary to the wishes of theinhabitants. Seeing that we have done more than any other Power to furtherArab freedom and to develop the countries of the Middle East, this seems a particularly unfortunate misapprehension, and the draft memorandum, therefore,deals with this aspect first.7. Mr. Willkie in his speeches and in his recent best-seller has confirmed inthe mind of the American public the feeling that the United States enjoys in theMiddle East a great fund of goodwill. There will be an increasing number ofAmericans who will wish to make use of this goodwill by exerting United Statesinfluence there, and we should certainly have great difficulty in keeping theUnited States out of the Middle East altogether. Another problem that has. tobe faced in Washington is the unfriendly attitude of the Political Adviser forMiddle East Affairs (which includes India), Mr. Wallace Murray. We havehad positive proof of his hostility in connexion with Persia, and it seemspreferable that there should be frank discussion rather than continued latentill-feeling. It should not be deduced from the above that we experience hostilitygenerally from the United States representatives in the countries of the middle east. In Cairo Mr. Alexander Kirk has been consistently helpful; so in a lesser degree has Mr. Wilson at Bagdad, and Mr. Ewart at Kabul has been a triedfriend for many years. Indeed, at both the recently created posts, Kabul andJedda, the American representatives are friendly.8. In communicating this memorandum to the Americans, our object wouldbe to explain our policy with complete frankness the permanent needs that under -iie our day-to-day policies, and to welcome any discussion on the memorandum,orally or in writing,&apos;or indeed, if the Americans think it would be useful, any statement of their own needs or desires. It seems better to keep the memorandumon general lines at this stage. We do not want to elicit in return, a memorandumfull of rebuttals and reserves regarding our policy in the Middle East.. For thesame reason, it will be as well at this preliminary stage to pass as lightly.aspossible over our strategic requirements, though we should indicate our general needs. The memorandum does not deal with Egypt or the Suez Canal, becausethe Americans seem to understand our position there clearly enough.9. The United States reply may include points connected with oil and with civil aviation, but it will be time enough to consider these points when they are expressed.  We shall be lucky if we succeed in bringing them into the open., 10. We should hope to arrange in the end for a high official of the state department to come to London in order to discuss Middle Eastern affairs with usin detail, and to reach a working understanding. We cannot expect the americans to sacrifice their interests to ours in the Middle East, but we may possibly hope to induce them to let us play the hand there, from a political, point of view, providedthat our policy commands their approval and that they are left sufficient latitudeon the commercial and cultural sides. ,On the supply side, we wish to reach agree-rnent with the Americans on such matters as the proposal for a Central Economic-Council for the Middle East, in which United States participation may be hotonly useful, but essential. ... il. To sum up, it is apparent that the Americans propose at least to have their say in the Middle East.   We cannot expect anything else if United States
36help is desired, and we should welcome any indication of a move away fromisolationism. But we must somehow ensure that United States influence, is not used against our own in an area where our vital interests are so closely affected.The annexed memorandum is an attempt to align our ideas with theirs and toreach general agreement on day-to-day policy. If there are serious divergenciesof view, then the sooner we know about them the better.A. E.Foreign Office, 12th July, 1943.ANNEX.Draft Memorandum.British Policy in the Middle East.1. This paper is written without regard to the possibility of an united nations organisation, in one form or another, being set up after the war for themaintenance of peace and security.2. There is nothing in British policy as defined below which need conflict with, or impede, such a desirable development. But it is relevant to remember that the region with which the paper deals does not contain either enemy States,or, in general, colonial territories. And its peace and security are, already andnot ineffectively, to some extent guaranteed by the treaty relations existing between its component States and Great Britain.3. When the countries of the Arab Peninsula were separated from theOttoman Empire as the result of the last war it was already clear that most ofthem had passed beyond the colonial era even though some of them were not yetquite fit to govern themselves. This state of affairs was recognised, by the systemof Mandates inaugurated for Syria, Palestine and Transjordan and the specialtreaty of 1922 concluded with Iraq. His Majesty&apos;s Government are proud tohave taken the lead in fostering and promoting self-government in these territories in accordance with their general policy of sympathy towards the Arab NationalistMovement, and they are in very close and friendly relations with all the arab countries.4. At the instance of His Majesty&apos;s Government the mandatory regime forIraq was terminated in 1930 and Iraq became an independent member of theLeague of Nations as well as&apos; ari ally of Great Britain who, under the treaty which was approved by the Council of the League, retained the responsibility forher defence against external aggression. When Syria Was removed from thecontrol of Vichy France and cleared of German influence, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were able to arrange with General de Gaulle for the recognition of Syrianand Lebanese independence. Only after the war will it be possible for theposition to be regularised by the formal termination of the Mandate in some way which, according to our conception, and assuming a stable and. co-operative post-war France, will involve the conclusion of treaties.between that country and the levant States, the effect of which will be&apos;to put France in a similar position tothat which Britain occupies in Iraq. Palestine is complicated by the questionof the Jewish Home but His Majesty&apos;s Government.hope that eventually it maybe possible to obtain some measure of agreement between the inhabitants ofPalestine on a satisfactory form of government.5. Transjordan is a more primitive and desert country but it is ruledautonomously by the Amir Abdullah with a certain amount of assistance fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government, who are responsible for the conduct of his foreign relations.L 6.   With Saudi Arabia His Majesty&apos;s Government are in the closest relations of friendship and they have given a substantial subsidy to Ibn Saud to enable&quot;L&quot; him to overcome the critical situation resulting from the war and the falling off of the pilgrim traffic. His Majesty&apos;s Government have also maintained speciallyfriendly relations for a great&quot; many years with the Arab States on the south coast of the Persian Gulf. ...7. Notwithstanding the division of the Arab countries into separate states which took place as the result of the last war there is a certain sense of unity[25738] - . b 2
among the Arabic-speaking peoples, particularly those who inhabit the Arablands, in Asia. A special interest has been shown in this question recently bythe Prime Ministers of Iraq and Egypt and by certain personalities in Syria.While few Arab politicians or statesmen agree in any detail on what can or shouldbe realised in this direction, His Majesty&apos;s Government have announced thatthey would view with sympathy any movement among Arabs to promote their economic, cultural and political unity. But clearly the initiative in the politicalsphere at least will have to come from the Arabs themselves, and so far as isknown no such scheme which would command general approval has yet been worked out.. 8. Persia and Afghanistan fall outside the framework of the Arab countries mentioned above, but they are of particular interest and importance toHis Majesty&apos;s Government since they border on Iraq and India, for the defenceof both of which His Majesty&apos;s Government are responsible..9. There is a certain economic unity of interest among the Middle Eastcountries. This has been especially emphasised during the war by the shortageof shipping, which has largely isolated the Middle East from the rest of theworld. The Middle East Supply Centre,&apos; in which British and United states representatives participate, is an attempt to rationalise the interests of the various countries in the manner which will best assist the war effort of the Allies and reduce the calls on shipping. It is possible that an economic organism could be created which would fulfil a unifying economic role in peace-time at any rateamong the Arab countries and at the same time provide a useful training ground in modern economic and commercial technique for the peoples of the countries concerned. . His Majesty&apos;s Government are now examining whether any progressin this direction is possible.10. The Middle East, as a whole, is of particular importance to the BritishCommonwealth of Nations, both individually and collectively. Not only is it inwar-time a buffer between our principal enemies, Germany and Japan, but it also contains one of the main oil reserves available to the British commonwealth and it is a vital area for our sea and air communications.11. With this prelude, further details may be given of British policy towardseach individual country.Palestine.12. The Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the Jewish home in Palestine has been so often stated and restated that it hardly seems necessaryto repeat it here except to point out that tranquillity in Palestine is essential for the duration of the war. This consideration must necessarily dominate all questions connected with the Jewish - Home and the attitude towards itsrealisation adopted by the local population both Jewish and Arab, as well asby the Jews in other parts of the world and by the Arabs in other Arab countries.As has already been stated, His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that eventuallyit may be possible to obtain some measure of agreement between the inhabitants of Palestine on a satisfactory form of government.13. Materially, Palestine has made astonishing progress since the last war. Whatever the political outcome may be, Haifa is bound to remain a port of very great importance as it is one terminus of the pipe-line from Kirkukto the Mediterranean. Palestine is also bound to, retain strategic importanceowing to its proximity to the Suez Canal and to sea. and air communicationsessential to the British Commonwealth of Nations.14. Under the Mandate His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook the sole responsibility for the administration of Palestine, and have borne, at the costof British resources and British lives, the burden of repressing the disturbances,consequent on the policy, approved by the League of Nations and United StatesGovernment, of facilitating the immigration of European Jews.Transjordan.15. The future of Transjordan cannot be altogether separated from thefuture of Palestine although it is under a separate Administration. The EmirAbdullah has several times suggested to His Majesty&apos;s Government the termina-tion of the Mandate but it seems better that a decision should await the outcome of the present state of transition in Palestine.
Levant States.16. As previously stated His Majesty&apos;s Government have been able toarrange for the recognition of Syrian and,Lebanese independence by general de Gaulle. In return they have assured General de Gaulle in an exchange of letters with Mr. Oliver Lyttelton, then Minister of State at Cairo, dated the7th August, 1941, that Great Britain has no interest in Syria or the Lebanonexcept to win the v/ar and that when the essential step of granting Syria andLebanon independence has been taken and without prejudice to it they freelyadmit that France should have the dominant position in Syria and the Lebanonover any other European Power. It is hoped that, as the result of the electionsabout to be held in the Levant States, Democratic Governments will emergesufficiently stable to enable the present position to be eventually regularised on similar lines to the position in Iraq. France will thus, presumably, have inthe Levant States after the war the same status as Great Britain enjoys in Iraq.17. The interest of His Majesty&apos;s&apos; Government in the Levant States is, as stated above, connected with the conduct of the war. The Allied troops in Syriaare under the command of a British General Officer Commanding. The british military authorities have established through rail communication from Haifa toAleppo and Bagdad. With the end of the war, the British interests in Syria willrevert to normal, though the political affiliation of the Levant States can never bea matter of indifference to His Majesty&apos;s Government, as a Power with largeresponsibilities and interests in the Eastern Mediterranean.18. Syria&apos;s production of cereals is of special importance to the economy ofthe Middle East in war conditions and a special Anglo-French organisation hasbeen established to ensure purchase and distribution of the harvest. Any failureof this organisation would probably result in large shipments of cereals being required from outside the Middle East and in a heavy call on Allied shipping.Iraq.19. Except for the brief period culminating in 1941 when Allied fortuneswere at a discount and German money was spent freely in subverting the country,His Majesty&apos;s Government have remained on very friendly terms with Iraq, the irrelations being governed by the Treaty of Alliance of 1930. Extensive economic,administrative and technical help has been given to Iraq, which has made much progress in the last twenty years. There are important reserves of oil in Iraq, thedevelopment of which has been undertaken by groups representing British, UnitedStates and other interests. Iraq will remain of special importance to the BritishCommonwealth of Nations, not only because of her oil resources, but also as a linkin the w^orld-system of air communications between different parts of the Empire.By Article 5 of the Treaty of Alliance of 1930 &quot; His Majesty the King of Iraqrecognises that the permanent maintenance and protection in all circumstances ofthe essential communications of His Britannic Majesty is in the common interestof the High Contracting Parties,&quot; and sites for air bases have, in accordance withthis Article, been allocated to His Majesty&apos;s Government at Shaiba andHabbaniyah.20. During the war Iraq has acquired a special importance as a base for theforces necessary to operate and protect the Persian Gulf supply routes to theSoviet Union and also as an important source of cereals and food-stuffs for con-sumption in the Middle East. Special arrangements have been made by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to purchase the Iraqi surplus of barley and dates for distribution according to the needs of other Middle East countries by the middle east Supply Centre.21. British policy in Iraq has to be related to policy in Persia. If, as ishoped, it is practicable to maintain the stability and independence of Persiaunimpaired by anything approaching &quot; spheres of influence,&quot; then general security and the defence of oil supplies and communications must be guaranteed by forces based on Iraqi, or other Arab territory. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentgratefully acknowledge the contribution the United, States Government is makingin many ways to the stability of Persia.Saudi A arabia. - -        ,22. Shortly after the conquest of the Hejaz and th$ expulsion of theHashimite dynasty by Ibn Saud, a treaty was concluded between him and HisMajesty&apos;s Government at Jedda on the 20th May, 1927, by which His Majesty&apos;s
Government recognised Ibn Saud as King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its depen-tendencies. Ibn Saud for his part undertook to maintain friendly and peacefulrelations with the Arab sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf, who were in specialtreaty relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government.23. Friendly relations with Ibn Saud are a matter of particular importanceto His Majesty&apos;s Government, both because of the former&apos;s influence, as keeperof the shrine at Mecca, with the large Moslem population in India and in otherparts of the British Empire, and because of Saudi Arabia&apos;s proximity to the sea route to India. Throughout the war Ibn Saud has made no secret of his symapathy for the cause of the democracies and on many occasions, notably during the Iraqirebellion of May 1941, he has used his influence on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.24. Saudi Arabia depends for its revenue to a great extent on the pilgrimageto Mecca and as this pilgrimage was seriously reduced by war conditions, HisMajesty&apos;s Government undertook to provide Ibn Saud with a subsidy. This nowlargely takes the form of a subsidy in kind., all essential supplies being providedthrough the Middle East Supply Centre at the cost of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Another source of revenue is provided by the California Arabian Standard oil company, which holds a large concession in Eastern Saudi Arabia. In the courseof time Ibn Saud should receive a substantial income from royalties, but at presentthe Company&apos;s operations are also affected by the war.The Yemen. ..25. The position of the Yemen on the route to India and on the northernboundary of the Aden Protectorate makes it an interest of His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment that no potentially hostile Power should acquire a dominant position in that,country. With this object in view His Majesty&apos;s Government concluded in.April 1938 an agreement with the Italian Government in which both partiesundertook to do nothing which might in any way impair the independence orintegrity of the Yemen or Saudi Arabia. The only matter of dispute between his Majesty&apos;s Government and the King of the Yemen is the question of thenorthern boundary of the Protectorate. Although His Majesty&apos;s Governmentmaintain that the Yemen, as a succession State of the Ottoman Empire, should accept the frontier agreed in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914, the King ofthe Yemen has refused to admit the validity of this Convention and claims large sections of the Aden Protectorate. By a treaty of the 11th February, 1934, thefrontier existing at that date was stabilised pending a final decision. Apartfrom occasional differences of opinion as to the actual line of the frontier,relations between the two countries have remained consistently friendly.Arab States in the Persian Gulf.26. As the outcome of long-sustained efforts to protect the peaceful traderof all nations and to suppress piracy, slaving, and later gun-funning, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have maintained for about a century special relations withthe British-protected States on the south shore of the Persian Gulf. We &quot;conduct their foreign relations and are responsible for their military protection. Thenatural poverty of these areas has greatly restricted their economic progress, but under the protection of His Majesty&apos;s Government they have enjoyed a periodof political tranquillity and relative prosperity for many years. Regular aircommunication has now been possible for many years over territory that wastraditionally a constant breeding-ground of bloodshed, and other grave abuses.The discovery of oil in the area should greatly improve their prospects, especially at Bahrein. . It is of great importance that no international or inter-Arabrivalries should disturb the existing peaceful conditions and thus impede thedevelopment of the oil resources of the area.27. In addition to the air communications to which reference has alreadybeen made, important cable communications run via the Persian Gulf to India.Persia.28. British policy in Persia was explained in some detail in a memorandumcommunicated to the United States Embassy in London on the .6th January,1943. The objectieif^of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to Persia seemedthen, and still seems, to correspond very closely with that of the United StatesGovernment.    , .
29.- Taking a long view, the interests of Persia, and of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment towards Persia, are identical. We desire to see a strong, stable and independent Persia, and the common interest of Persia, of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and of the Soviet Government in this aim is expressed in the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Alliance signed in January 1942. According to this Treaty, &quot; theforces of the Allied Powers shall be withdrawn from Iranian territory not later than six months after all hostilities between the Allied Powers and Germany and her associates have been suspended by the conclusion of an armistice or armistices,or on the conclusion of peace between them, whichever date is the earlier.&quot; HisMajesty&apos;s Government have every intention of adhering to this undertaking, andthey have no reason to think that the Soviet Government entertain any contraryintentions., 30. His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the hardships which the war has brought to Persia, which they have done their utmost to mitigate within the limitations imposed by the world shortage of shipping and commodities and bythe paramount need in; the interests of the common war effort to send themaximum possible amount of supplies to Russia. In so far as the difficultiesof Persia are due to administrative defects, His Majesty&apos;s &quot;Government havehoped that United States advisers might best be able to exercise a useful influence in Persia. If Americans were not available it would probably be necessary to propose that the Persian Government should seek advisers from some other Powerthan Britain or the Soviet Union. Meanwhile His Majesty&apos;s Government haveactively encouraged the appointment of United States Advisers and have given them, and will continue to give them, all the support possible to carry out theirdifficult tasks. They have welcomed United States participation in theorganisation and operation of the Persian supply routes to Russia, and, in general,they would be glad of close co-operation with the United States Government inall matters affecting Persia. *31. Their principal commercial interest is in the Anglo-Iranian oil company, the oil output of which is of the highest strategic concern to the wholeBritish Commonwealth of Nations. India also has specially close relations with Persia in the commercial sphere.32. Persia is also of special strategic concern because it borders on India,for the defence of which His Majesty&apos;s Government are responsible. The s^meapplies to the defence of Iraq.Afghanistan.33. The maintenance of an indepenedent Afghanistan is fundamental tothe defence of India, because of the strategic position which the country occupiesacross the routes followed by all the past invasions of India by land. Theexistence there of a stable and friendly Government is also essential to the tran-quillity of India&apos;s North-West Frontier, because a weak Government in afghanistan-stan could not control the tribes in their own territory and an unfriendly one could very easily stimulate the tribes on both sides of the frontier to hostilityagainst us. Morover, it is desirable that the.Afghan Government should not seek to intrigue in Indian politics, as this could only make it more difficult forIndians to resolve their internal differences. The present regime in Afghanistanis entirely satisfactory in all these respects, and it is matter for satisfaction thatduring nearly four years of war the situation on the frontier has remainedundisturbed, except in Waziristan, where the activities of hostile gangs instigatedby the Faqir of Ipi have caused some trouble to the British authorities.34. The traditional policy of all Afghan Governments has been to play off -Russia against Great Britain. They cannot do this at present, and instead theyare seeking an alternative balance by straddling the fence between the united nations and the Axis. In this connection they attach importance to the main-tenance of their diplomatic relations with the Axis and the refusal of facilitiesfor us for the transit of supplies to the Soviet Union through their territory.Indeed, these points are at present regarded by Afghans as symbols of their independence, and their enforced abandonment would be so unpopular as to weaken the internal position of the Afghan Government.. On the other hand, thesecurity of India&apos;s North-West Frontier obliges us to maintain pressure on theAfghan Government to ensure that, so long as the Axis Legations remain atKabul, they are rendered incapable of serious intrigues aimed against us (or against the Afghan Government themselves). But in exerting this pressure it isessential to avoid driving the Afghan Government to action which would
endanger their own stability, the maintenance of which is our first concern. Asthe possibility of an Axis victory further recedes, it is likely to become easier for the Afghan Government to take drastic action against the Axis Legations.35. The economic stability of Afghanistan is important as a means of preserving its political tranquillity and the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis to do everything possible, despite the difficulties of war, conditions, to provideAfghanistan with essential supplies and find markets for Afghan products.Conclusion.36. The above sets out not only British interests, but also the international arrangements to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are parties and which con-tribute to the security of certain countries in the Middle East. It is the hope ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government that the degree of security so provided, either by itselfor strengthened by new arrangements, will enable the individual nations todevelop free institutions, social reforms and better standards of living, as well ascommercial and other beneficial forms of intercourse with other countries.
