(43) 200)15th July, 1943WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 202)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 8th July, to0700 15th July,1943[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.
SICILY.Military.1. The invasion -of Sicily by the 15 Army Group, consisting of the recon-stituted British Eighth Army, which includes Canadians, and the U.S. SeventhArmy, began at 0300 on the 10th July. The seaborne assaults were preceded byBritish ana U.S. paratroop attacks which were directed respectively againstthe harbour and seaplane base of Syracuse and the airfield in the area of Gela.Weather conditions were by no means perfect and a stiff wind considerably increased the hazards of the airborne attacks. It did not. however, impair their efficiency, and in the Syracuse area the British paratroops, who were landed fromgliders, quickly attained their objectives, while at Geia similar success attended the efforts of the U.S. paratroops.2. Under cover of the Allied air forces and supported by Allied navalbombardment, the seaborne- assaults all went in according to plan in spite ofchoppy seas which, in the U.S. sector, caused a little delay. The landings tookplace oxer a hundred-mile stretch of coast in the south-east corner cf the Island.3. The Eighth Army landed over beaches in the Avola area and on all threesides of the Pachino Peninsula. The Seventh Army went in at Scoglitti, Gela andLicata. The enemy was, without doubt, caught unprepared and was at first con-fused as to the extent of the Allied landings. Resistance by the coast defence troops was but half-hearted, and the only real trouble encountered was by theU.S. at Gela, who quickly had to deal with an enemy counter-attack supportedby tanks.4. Once on land the progress of the Allied armies wras rapid and accordingto plan. The Eighth Army had by 1400 hours on the 10th &quot;captured Cassibile,Noto and the town and airfield of Pachino, while later on the evening of the same day the infantry pushed northwards up the coast, linked up with the paratroopsand occupied Syracuse, Bv midday on the 11th Rosolini and Pozzailo were in our hands. Having established a firm bridgehead, and having captured Syracusepractically intact, the landing of. stores and vehicles &quot;was able to proceed smoothly.On the 12th the Eighth Army, whose main axes of advance were northwards upthe coast towards Catania and north-west into the mountainous region aroundVizzini, captured Augusta and Palazzolo, while further south the Canadiansentered Ragusa. Good progress in both directions is being maintained. In the inland thrust Vizzini has been taken and in the coastal region the advance con-tinued beyond Augusta to Lentini, while on the 13th/14th another paratroopattack was made with the object of securing an important bridge over the riverwhich lies half-way between Lentini and Catania. On the afternoon of the 14th,a column of our tanks made contact with the paratroops. The progress of the infantry has been slightly slowed down due to a temporary shortage of M.T.5. Meanwhile, the Seventh Army having overcome the initial difficultiesof weather and enemy counter-attacks has secured a considerable bridgehead,including the capture of three important airfields, and has kept pace with the advance of the Eighth Army, with whom they have made contact on their right.The U.S. advance has everywhere made a penetration of at least 15 milesinland, and in some cases considerably further. Their line runs roughly fromthe Canadian left flank at Vizzini to Mazzarino-Riesi-Canicatti and thencesouth-west through Naro and Palma di Montechiaro to the coast.6. So far more than 12,000 prisoners have been taken. These include afew Germans, but the majority &quot;are Italians, who have not, on the whole, so farshown a very great relish for battle; the main enemy forces have yet to be encountered. The civil population are said to be not unfriendly.7. Although so far the operation has met with a remarkable success, the speed of our advance will depend to a large extent on the rate at which theunloading of stores and vehicles can be maintained over the beaches. This was delayed by unfavourable weather in the initial stages, and though now proceeding satisfactorily is still behind schedule.Naval.8. Forces of heavy ships in the Ionian Sea and to the west of Sicily providedcover for the assaults. A force of cruisers and destroyers provided close gunsupport and has continued to bombard enemy batteries as required.
9. Early on the 10th cruisers, and M.T.Bs. bombarded Catania and two cruisers demonstrated off the west coast of Sicily. Oil cisterns at Catania, hitduring the bombardment, were still burning 48 hours later. In all, 2,755 ships and landing craft were employed. No naval opposition was encountered. Thefirst tanks were ashore by 0500 in the Porto Palo sector, and by mid-day all tanklanding ships and craft had been unloaded in the sector north of Pachino.South-west of Pachino 9,000 assault troops were landed by noon. By 2349 alllarge infantry landing ships had completed unloading in the British sector andhad left the beaches. In the U.S. sector, U.S. Destroyer Maddox was sunk by aircraft and two U.S. combat loaders, two destroyers and a tank.landing shipwere damaged. U.S. Destroyers Roe and Stvanson were damaged in collision, andthe U.S. minesweeper Sentinel was sunk by aircraft at Licata. The hospital shipTalamba, fully illuminated off Avola, was bombed and sunk. All the patientswere rescued. During the night of the 10th/ 11th, some parachute mines were dropped in the anchorage south-west of Pachino.10. On the 11th all landings proceeded satisfactorily in improved weather,and all submarines which had been employed to mark the landing beaches returnedto Malta.U.S. transports Barnett (7,712 tons) and Orizaba (6,937 tons) and a.tanklanding ship were damaged by aircraft off Gela, and some landing craft were damaged off Avola. H.M. Destroyers Blankney and Brissenden bombardedPozzallo village ((south-west of Syracuse), which surrendered. Twenty prisoners were taken. H.M. Monitor Erebus, with three cruisers, bombarded Modica andMelilli. U.S. Cruisers assisted to repel a counter attack by tanks at Gela.M.T.Bs. sank an Italian minesweeper off Catania. At 2100 the port of Syracusewas occupied and found to be undamaged, except by Allied bombing. Sixty percent, of the berths were available. By midnight, the 7th and 8th Armies expectedeach to have landed 80,000 men, 7,000 vehicles, 300 tanks and 900 guns.11. On the night of the 11th/12th heavy ships bombarded Favignana andtwo cruisers bombarded Marsala        diversion.On the morning of the 12th three cruisers bombarded Augusta, A channelwas swept and shortly after mid-day an unsuccessful attempt was made to enter the harbour. Later enemy troops withdrawing were shelled by three destroyers.H.M. Destroyer Exnioor was slightly damaged. H.M. Destroyer Eskimo was hit by a bomb and towed to Malta to dock. H.M. Destroyers Blankney andBrissenden were in collision off Pachino. The latter was badly damaged. Thehospital ship Dorsetshire had some casualties when she was near-missed by a bomboff Pachino. The British Ennerdale, a tanker fitted to carry mechanised landing craft, was damaged by bombing on the 10th, 11th and 12th.12. By the 13th the weather had improved and a shuttle service to and fromSicily proceeded satisfactorily. U.S. cruisers bombarded west of Empedocle and h.M.S. Erebus bombarded Catania airfield. In the Straits of Messina, M.T.Bs.engaged enemy E-boats, two of which were driven ashore on fire. One M.T. ship was sunk off Avola.In the U.S. Sector, combat loader convoys left Gela and Scogletti aftercompleting their discharge. US. minelayers laid mines off Gela to protect theanchorage. On the following day the U.S. Cruiser Brooklyn was slightly damaged,in this minefield. Late on the 14th, Augusta was clear of the enemy, A.A.defences were installed and the port party took charge. Harbour installationsappeared to be undamaged and four oil and petrol carriers were captured intact.The floating dock was undamaged.During the night of the 13th/14th H.M.S. Prince Albert (Infantry landingship) landed Commandos, at the south end of Catania Bay, while H.M.S. Erebusagain bombarded Catania airfield.Air Operations.13. Intensive attacks were maintained against Sicilian airfields on the days and nights preceding the landing of our forces on the Island. Gerbini. andits satellite landing grounds were the most heavily bombed, but successful raids were also made on Comiso, Borizzo, Biscari, Sciaeca, Catania and Trapani/Milo.Other targets attacked included the barracks and railroad at Caltanissetta(32 miles N.N.W. of Gela), the railway centre at Catania, Palazzolo Acreide,Syracuse and other focal points in south-east Sicily.   Mustangs (A. 36) made[25756] b
nearly 150 sorties against coastal targets near Porto Empedocle. Liberators(B. 24) obtained many direct hits on a H.Q. and communication buildings atTaormina, leaving the area covered in flames and smoke.Shortly before midnight on the 9th July 363 troop carrier aircrafttowing 137 gliders took off from bases in North Africa for the invasion of Sicily.Landings were made N.W. of Cap Murro Di Porco, NW. of Syracuse and betweenLicata and Gela, and preceded the land forces. The majority were made within one mile of the selected spots, but some gliders landed short in the sea owing tothe high wind.The invasion force was protected from enemy air attack by fightersoperating from Malta and Pantelleria. On each of the four succeeding daysthese fighters encountered approximately 140 enemy aircraft, and in all 80 were shot down for the loss of 24 Spitfires. One Ju. 52 escorted by 30 enemy fighterswas intercepted by six Spitfires, who shot down seven of the fighters and destroyed the Ju. 52.Lightnings (P. 38) and Mustangs (A. 36) in big formations carried outoffensive sweeps  (gainst communications in central and south-eastern areas of the island and also attacked fleeting targets. Large numbers of M.T. vehicles were destroyed, locomotives and.rolling stock were damaged, road junctions, barracks,power stations, bridges, ammunition clumps and other military targets were successfully attacked.Medium and light bombers made heavy attacks on centres of tacticalimportance in the rear of the enemy front. The towns bombed included Palazzolo,Caltanissetta, Agrigento and Canicatti. Enna was the target for several raidsand the railway station, the town and M.T. in the vicinity were seriously damaged.Airfields in south-east Sicily and one at Trapani/Milo were also successfully attacked.Three attacks by a total of 137 heavy bombers were made on the railway centre and airfield at Catania, and considerable damage was reported.Fortresses (B. 17) dropped nearly 200 tons of bombs in one raid on Messina, andLiberators (B. 24) and Halifaxes made heavy and destructive attacks on ReggioDi Calabria and San Giovanni.In the course of all these operations enemy opposition was only on a moderate scale and his losses were considerable.It is reported that the captured airfields at Comiso, Ponte Olivo, Licataand Pachino are now serviceable for our aircraft.During the week ended the 13th July, 180 enemy aircraft were shot down;96 Allied aircraft are missing.  A total of 15,188 sorties were flown.naval SITUATION.General Review.14.

Four U-boats have. been probably sunk, twopossibly sunk, four probably damaged and two possibly damaged.Shipping casualties have been above the average. F.W. aircraft have sunktwo large transports.Shipping casualties in June were the lowest since November 1941.Home Waters.15. The Home Fleet operated off the Norwegian coast as a diversion to the invasion of Sicily. They were sighted and reported by a reconnaissance aircraft,which was later shot down by aircraft from H.M.S. Furious.16. On the morning of the 10th, H.M. Destroyers Melbreak and Wensley-dale and Norwegian Destroyer Glaisdale engaged three torpedo-boats escorted by R-boats north-east of Ushant. One R-boat was sunk and one torpedo-boatseverely damaged. H.M.S.&apos; Melbreak was seriously damaged forward and sustained 18 casualties, five of which were fatal. Glaisdale and Wensleydalewere slightly damaged.

Although heavy ships have been seen with steam up at Genoa, Speziaand Taranto, no movements of the Italian Fleet have taken place to interfere withour operations in Sicily,Japanese.25. Although there are indications that some Japanese heavy ships arereturning from Home Waters to the SW. Pacific, the enemy have so far opposed the Allied offensive in the Central Solomons and New Guinea area with light cruisers and destroyers only. However, on the 6th a heavy cruiser was seen east of Bougainville, steering south; and on the 10th two other heavy cruisers were sighted north of Kavieng.U-boats.26. Less than 100 U-boats are at present at sea in the Atlantic and IndianOceans.There is no activity in the N.W. Approaches.A small number of U-boats are operating off South Africa, in the Caribbean,in the coastal areas of the Guianas and off the Gold Coast.It is estimated that 17 German U-boats are operating in the Mediterranean.Enemy Attack on Shipping.27. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked nine ships, ofwhich five are known to have sunk.Two ships in a U.S. eastbound convoy were sunk off the north coast of Brazil,and two ships in convoy were sunk off Lagos. Three ships in a westbound convoywere torpedoed off Bougie but reached port. One ship was sunk off Rio de Janeiroand another torpedoed off Mozambique.28. F.W. aircraft have been active against shipping off the Spanish andPortuguese coasts.   One ship in convoy from Lisbon was damaged off Cape St.
Vincent on the 9th but reached Gibraltar. Late on the evening of the 11th asouthbound escorted convoy of three ships was, attacked by six F.Ws. about300 miles west of Vigo. The transports California (16,792 tons) and Duchess ofYork (20,021 tons) with 1,000 troops for West Africa were set on fire andsubsequently sunk. 1,815 survivors were picked up. On the following eveningthe third ship, Port Fairy (8,337 tons) was damaged off Cape St. Vincent butreached Casablanca.29. During operations off the Sicilian coast, Dutch s.s. Baarn (5,621 tons)and British s.s. Ocean Peace ^,173 tons) were bombed and sunk off Avola andthe U.S. Robert Rowan (7,176 tons) off Gela; U.S. Joseph G. Cannon (7,181 tons)was seriously damaged off Avola.30. A belated report has been received that a Norwegian ship on passage from Freemantle to Abadan was sunk by a German raider on the 15th June1,500 miles north-west of Freemantle.31. Shipping losses from enemy action during June, as recorded to date,amounted to 25 ships totalling 118,000 tons, which is the lowest monthly totalsince November 1941. U-boats accounted for 19 ships (101,000 tons), of which12 ships (61,000 tons) were sunk in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Onlyone ship was sunk by U-boats in the North Atlantic. Five ships (24,000 tons)were sunk by U-boats in the Mediterranean.&quot; Three ships (6,000 tons) were sunk by aircraft, two ships (3,000 tons) by mines and one ship (8,000 tons) by surfaceraider.Five tankers, totalling 33,000 tons, were lost during the month.Marine risk accounted for 32,000 tons, making a total of 150,000 tons ofshipping lost by enemy action and marine causes for the month of June.Protection of Seaborne Trade.32. During the week ending the 11th 1,133 ships were convoyed. Of these,428 were in ocean convoys and 705 in&apos; British coastal convoys. Sixty-four destroyers (including nine U.S. destroyers), 84 sloops, frigates and corvettes,one merchant aircraft-carrier, four escort carriers, one anti-aircraft ship andone ocean boarding vessel were employed on escort duties.Four ocean convoys, consisting of 239 ships, arrived in Home Waters duringthe week without loss.33. During the week ending the 9th imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 947,000 tons, compared with 1,251,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 924,900 tons during the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 330,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.34. During June, 14 homebound ocean convoys of 591 ships and 15 outward-bound convoys of 572 ships reached their destinations without loss.In the West Atlantic and Caribbean 172 convoys of 1,742 ships reached their destination without loss, and one convoy, originally of 35 ships, lost one by minebefore arrival.In Home Waters 134 coastal convoys of 2,791 ships were escorted during the.month with the loss of only one ship, which was mined.British Minelaying.35. During the week surface craft laid minesv off the Belgian coast. Air-craft laid mines off the Frisian Islands, the Dutch coast and in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.36. There have been no reports of enemy minelaying by either surface craftor aircraft during the week.,Eight ground mines were destroyed off the East Coast and one moored minein Lyme Bay.The mine totals are : 4,412 ground and 3,003 moored.37.   Five minesweeping Flotillas took part in the Sicilian operations.Searched channels have been established at Syracuse, Augusta and Gela.An acoustic ground mine, probably laid by U-boat, has been destroyed offBrisbane.
Enemy Merchant Shipping.38. Fifteen arrivals and-twenty sailings of ore ships have been reported from. Bilbao during the week.The. German tanker Wilhelmsburg, of unknown tonnage, which entered the^aegean on the 6th, is reported to have been sunk five miles west of Tenedos onthe 7th.It is reported that 21,500 tons .of petroleum products have passed into the aegean from the Black Sea since the 13th June, whereas in the previous twelvemonths the monthly deliveries by this route were only 2,360 tons. It is suggestedthat the enemy is losing no time in stocking up his garrisons in the ./ gean, andthe dislocations of the Balkan railway communications may have been partly responsible for the increased quantities carried by sea.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.39. The German attack in the Orel-Kursk-Byelgorod Sector, which beganon the 5th July, has continued and tended for some days to increase in intensity.It has taken the form of a pincer attack directed towards Kursk from north andsouth. The northern attack was made on a 25-30 mile front in the area of therailway Orel-Kursk, and the Germans have succeeded in advancing to a distance of some ten or twelve miles. The southern attack was made on a front of some25 miles astride the railway Byelgorod-Kursk. Here a penetration to a depth of about 25 miles was made and was subsequently extended westwards, but nobreak through has so far been achieved.The Germans have been using very powerful forces with a high proportion of armoured divisions, which have included a considerable number of Tiger heavytanks. Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy losses and there is no doubt thatin fighting of this intensity losses both in men and material must have been high.It is clear that the offensive is a determined attempt to eliminate the Russiansalient in this sector of the front. The advances made by the Germans obviouslyconstitute a serious threat to the Russian forces holding the salient and, althoughthe Russians are resisting very strongly, the position is still critical. there seems, however, to be a slight slackening of German pressure, which may be only temporary but may equally well indicate that the climax of the offensive is past.In this connection it is interesting to note that in the big offensive which began in June of last year, the Germans took about ten days to break throughthe Russian positions, and about fifteen to reach Voronezh, 90 miles from theirstart line.Burma.A fakan.40. On the 8th a highly successful raid was made on Maungdaw by one company of British troops and R.E. personnel, covered by a second british company. A machine-gun post in Maungdaw was captured and the villageoccupied. Our troops later withdrew after having killed 21 of the enemy and wounded 7.   Our casualties were 6 killed and 8 wounded.Chin Hills.41. Minor patrol clashes in the Fort &quot;White-Kalemyo area resulted in asmall number of casualties to Japanese troops and transport.South-West Pacific.Solomon Islands.42. On the 8th a further landing was made at Rice Anchorage on the north-west coast of New Georgia about 10 miles from Munda airfield, which is nowbeing attacked from the north and east. The forces have advanced some distanceinland from Rice Anchorage.   Vangunu Island has now been cleared of Japanese.New Guinea.43. Fighting has continued in the Mubo-Salamaua area. On the 8thAustralian troops occupied Observation Hill, the last Japanese position over-looking Mubo. The Japanese have withdrawn behind the northern arm of theBitoi River, which flows into the sea just north of Nassau Bay.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.44. Fortresses (B. 17) dropped, over 500 tons of bombs on airfields in occupied France.At night, Bomber Command attacked Cologne, Gelsenkirchen and Aachen, inforce. Lancasters bombed Turin the heaviest, operation by home-based aircraft on an Italian target. *Operations in conjunction with the invasion of Sicily were intensive (videparagraph 13).In the Pacific, softening operations against Munda (New Georgia) and theSalamaua area (New Guinea) were intensified.United Kingdom.45. The first daylight raid by enemy-long-range bombers for two monthstook place on the 9th July when about 10 Do. 217&apos;s crossed the south coast and operated over Kent, Sussex and Surrey.At night about 65 enemy aircraft were reported overland. A sharp attack by 25 bombers was made on Grimsby and Cleethorpes and another similar attack was made on Hull.   Some scattered bombing occurred in Kent.Five enemy aircraft (one by A.A. guns) were shot down.Coastal Operations.46. Escorted R.P. Beaufighters (one is missing) attacked a 2,000-ton&quot; Sperrbrecher &quot;-type ship off the Norwegian coast, leaving her on fire and downby the stern. Mustangs ((P. 51), Typhoon bombers and naval Albacores damaged a torpedo-boat off Ostend and six minesweepers, a trawler and a tug in enemy waters.Seventy-eight aircraft of Bomber Command laid 223 sea mines. One aircraft is missing.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.47. On the 10th, Fortresses (B. 17), escorted by fighters, attacked two air-fields in France, with results described as &quot; fair &quot;; 31 aircraft dropped 65 tons atCaen/Capriquet (see Appendix VI) and 36 aircraft dropped 77 tons atAbbeville. On the 14th, three other airfields were bombed with good effect(assessments of two of the attacks appear in Appendix VI), the bombershaving fighter cover during part of the operations : Villacoublay (96 air-craft, 198 tons), Le Buorget (55 aircraft, . 118 tons) and Amiens/Blisy (53aircraft, 57 tons). Twelve Fortresses (B. 17), of the 554 despatched on these fiveoperations, are missing (one crew is safe). The following enemy casualties in combat are reported provisionally: Destroyed 77, probably destroyed 53,damaged 22. Escorting fighters, five of which are missing, destroyed seven&apos;enemy aircraft and probably destroyed or damaged eight more.During the week, escorted Mitchells (B. 25), Venturas (B. 34), Bostons(A. 20) and Typhoon-bombers attacked the railway centre at St. Omer and the airfields at Abbeville, Tricqueville, Maupertus, Brest and Morlaix. light bombers raided power stations at Chocques (see Appendix VI), Mazingarbe andBeuvry. Mustangs (P. 51), Spitfires and Typhoons concentrated on transporta-tion targets in Northern France and the Low Countries; canal lock-gates nearYpres and. Courtrai were hit, 30 locomotives and a number of barges were destroyed or damaged and four enemy aircraft were shot down. Six of our aircraft are missing from these operations.Night.48. Cologne and Gelsenkirchen were the targets for our heavy bombers onthe 8th/9th and the following night. Totals of 247 and 373 aircraft respectivelydropped 1,037 tons of bombs on the first-named and 1,304 tons on the second.In both instances blind-bombing technique was employed and, despite theobliteration of the aiming-points by thick cloud, good concentrations are believed to have been achieved.   On the 13th/14th 327 aircraft released 812 tons on
Aachen during an attack lasting about 25 minutes; a proportion of the mainforce found gaps in the cloud through which their bombs were released, andothers, under deteriorating conditions, bombed the reflected glow of the markers.See Appendix VI.The German toiun of Aachen, on the frontiers of Holland and Belgium, inaddition to being a key railway centre, has numerous textile factories, a tyre plant and coal and engineering works.Thirty-nine bombers, from the 1,094 despatched on these three operations&apos;did not return; five others crashed, but four crews are safe. Four interceptingenemy night fighters were destroyed. .Intruders maintained their offensive operations against transportationtargets and airfields in Germany and enemy-occupied territory. propaganda leaflets- were released over 23 towns in France.Northern Italy.49. On the night the 12th/ 13th 295 Lancasters (13 are missing and onecrashed) were despatched to attack the important industrial city and rail centre of Turin. This operation, involving a round flight, as routed, of nearly2,000 miles, was carried out through difficult weather. Conditions improved overthe target, enabling 256 aircraft to concentrate 734 tons on and around theaiming-point (see Appendix VI).  One enemy aircraft was shot down.Mediterranean.Sicily.50.   Air operations are reported in paragraph 13.Italy.51. - A total of 46 Liberators (B. 24) made two attacks on Vibo Valentiaairfield (toe of Italy); the hangars were hit and fires were reported amongaircraft on the ground. Monte Corvino/Rovella airfield. (36 miles S.E. of Naples)was bombed by 25 Wellingtons.A attacks on Shipping.52. On. the 11th, Beaufighters attacked a convoy east of Sardinia; two ships and two Destroyers were hit, and one of the ships was left sinking. A ship offPalermo was hit and blew up.Russia.53. Since the opening of the German offensive in the Orel-Kursk Byelgorodareas the Soviet Air Force has been heavily engaged in defensive fighter opera-tions and in close support of the Russian ground forces. A high scale of effort was maintained until the end of the week when weather interfered with flyingoperations. Throughout the week the Russians have held their own againstthe Luftwaffe.The daily Russian claims of German aircraft destroyed published, in thecommuniques amount to as many as 1,126 aircraft between,5th and 12th Julyinclusive. Each night throughout the week, Russian long-range aircraft attackedGerman troop concentrations in the battle area, and on the night of the 9th July,Byelgorod railway junction was also attacked. -G.A.F. operations in support of the German offensive between Orel andByelgorod were intense until about the 10th July, and during the first few daysmay have amounted to 1,500-2,000 sorties per 24 hours. Thereafter bad flyingweather, intervened, and reports from the front suggest that the daily scale of effort has subsequently been reduced by a half.So far, however, there is no sign that the German Air Force have succeeded in opening a way through the Soviet lines for the land forces.Burma.54. In spite of the climatic difficulties which caused a number of sorties tobe abandoned, our aircraft, whenever conditions permitted, operated widely overvarious areas, including the Mandalay, Akyab and Upper Chindwin districts.
The centre span of the Loilaw railway bridge, near Mogaung, was demolished,together with part of the north and south approaches and 200 feet of track.Kittyhawks (P. 40) carried out the attack and they also destroyed a building atSumprabum, believed to be a Japanese Headquarters. The river bridge at Mu(Mandalay) was hit by Mitchells (B. 25). Hurricanes sank or damaged upwards of 100 river craft between Akyab and Ramree Island.Pacific Zone.Solomon Islands.55. Allied torpedo, dive, light and heavy bombers were active throughoutthe period under review. In particular, heavy attacks were pressed homeconstantly against Munda, New Georgia, and its supply base at BaerokoHarbour more than 200 sorties were flown by light bombers against these targets.The Japanese airfield at Vila, on Kolombangara Island, and the air base at Kahili,near Buin, South Bougainville, were also raided. A destroyer, beached onKolombangara, was set on fire and four intercepting fighters destroyed, without loss...Three attacks by heavily escorted formations of enemy aircraft were made onRendova Island; 19 aircraft were shot down by fighters and three by A.A. gunfire.In these actions Allied losses were one naval Corsair (F4. Ul) and one Wildcat(F.4F-3). vNew Guinea.56. Allied attacks were concentrated on enemy installations, villages, bivouacareas and troop concentrations in the Salamaua district-on most days about60 aircraft&apos; attacked these objectives. Enemy positions around Bobdubi andMubo were also raided, in support of our land forces.Allied positions at Nassau Bay were attacked on two occasions and the enemymade one ineffectual raid on Bena Bena (100 miles W.N.W. of Lae).HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.57. Gn three occasions during the period the enemy have made air attacksof some consequence, but the effect on the national war effort has amounted to littlemore than nuisance value.On the afternoon of the 9th bombs were dropped at two places in greater london; at Croydon, an important factory was affected and there were nine fatalcasualties; at East Grinstead, a cinema was hit, where there were 50 fatalcasualties.Grimsby and Cleethorpes were attacked on the night of the 12th/ 13th. Themain attack was on Grimsby where sixty-six bombs were dropped and fell cheifly the Dock area and on the railway each side of the Town station. At Cleethorpeshouse property was damaged.  Fatal casualties for both towns numbered 55.On the night of 13th/14th bombs were dropped on Hull. A number pffires were started, all of which were soon under control. The Dock area was affected and the L.N.E.R. line to Withernsea blocked. Fatal casualtiesamounted to 24. -Casualties.58. Civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours on the 14th were145 killed and 256 seriously injured. .*[25756]c

APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Italy.Turin: An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 13th Julyof the attack on the 12th/13th July is hampered by the smoke of fires still burningin the north industrial area; in addition, the town is not fully covered. However,it appears that the main weight of the attack fell on the N. and N.E. areas,especially in the immediate vicinity of both banks of the River Dora, and heavy damage can be seen to many factories.   These include : 1. Fiat steel works N. of River Dora. . &apos;2. Fiat steel works S. of River Dora,3. The State Arsenal..4. Soc. Conduttori Electrici d&apos;Affini (Electric cables).5. Fautrero Ettore (Timber Merchants).A tram depot, a gasworks and several unidentified factories were also severely damaged. &apos;Residential damage does not appear to be heavy.Germany.Wwppertal. A final interpretation of photographs taken on the 20th Juneshows that almost the entire weight of the attack on the 29th/30th May fell onBarmen, where the damage is amongst the most severe yet seen. 90 per cent, ofthe fully built-up areas and more than half of the less built-up areas aredevastated.The town is a centre of the textile industry and a number of textile factorieswere destroyed or severely damaged, among them those of J. P. Bemberg(Priority 1 target). The factories completely destroyed include the ZimmermanSheet Metal Works; Vorwerk and Sohne, manufacturers of solid rubber tyres fortanks, have been 50 per cent, destroyed. Two electric power stations, two gas-works, a waterworks, and a main railway station were severely damaged. Not-withstanding the intervals between the photographs and the date of the attack,only two attempts at repair or reconstruction can be seen, first to the J. P. BembergWorks, where considerable roof repair has been undertaken to certain shops, and,secondly, to the tramway depot, where repairs to roof lights are in progress.Oberhausen. Photographs taken on several dates now cover the area. Ober-hausen, unlike most towns in the Ruhr, has no really fully built-up area, the mostcongested part of the town being only 14 per cent, built-up. Notwithstanding this,there is considerable devastation and the two principal works, the Gutehofi&apos;-nungahutte A.G. (Steelworks, Priority 1), Babcock and Wilcox (Boiler Works,Priority 1) have both been severely damaged. The Concordia Coal Mines,Pits IV/V, have been damaged in the past and, although some buildings havebeen repaired, the recovery plant and other installations appear inactive.Dusseldorf. A final interpretation of photographss taken on the 18tlh and20th June shows that the leading commercial city of Western Germany has been heavily devastated by fire and H.T. The central area of the town between the rhine and the Main Station which contains the chief business and administrativebuildings is two-thirds destroyed, and damage and destruction spread eastwardsand southwards to the main industrial areas. The damage, though most con-centrated in the town proper, is also severe in the suburbs. Some buildings were still smouldering on the 7th day after the raid, but it is evident that fires, whollyout of control, have spread throughout the town.Of the 42 damaged factories which have been identified five are of theutmost importance and include the Schiess-Defries A.G., leading producers of heavy machine tools, and the Rheinmetall Borsig A.G., one of the most important
manufacturers of all types of heavy armaments in Germany. At least a further12 factories are directly concerned with war production. In addition, some22 unidentified factories have been damaged.Warehouses and store sheds in the dock area and in railway goods depotsin other parts of the town suffered heavily. Lines in marshalling yards andsidings are cut by many direct hits and at least 135 goods wagons destroyed,while buildings of the Main Station and Parcels Office were damaged.Three tramway depots, two fire stations and two police stations suffered damage, and the town gas works and the municipal power station are heavilyaffected. Numerous State and administrative buildings are amongst the vastnumber destroyed or severely damaged, and the devastation of business and.residential property is so severe and widespread that it is estimated that 35 percent, of property in the built-up areas has now been destroyed or seriously damaged, and that dwelling space for more than 26,000 families is no longer-available in Dusselclorf.Krefeld. A final interpretation of photographs taken on the 24th Juneafter the attack on 21st-22nd June shows that, while approximately 58 per cent,of the fully built-up area has been completely destroyed, the most concentrateddamage has been caused in the centre of the town : from the centre it has spreadnorthwards and eastwards to the more industrialised district north-east of thetown proper, where damage is very severe. There are scattered areas of damage in the south of the town, but the suburban areas have been only lightly affected.Eleven identified factories (eight of them textile firms, some of which are engaged in silk-weaving for parachutes) and 12 smaller unidentified concerns inthe town have been destroyed or seriously damaged.There is severe damage to the town&apos; gas works and, though less severe, to the municipal power station, while the electricity administrative offices have been gutted. Two fire stations, two police stations, two post offices, two tramwaydepots and many buildings of military barracks in two districts of the town havealso been destroyed or damaged., The &quot;damage to business and residential property,including many public buildings such as the district courts, the Town AssemblyHall, the town theatre and the market hall is very heavy.A achen.-Although the whole of the Central and North-Eastern part of thetown is obscured by the smoke of fires still burning and a considerable part cannotbe seen at ail, an immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 14th Julyshows that very heavy damage has been done. Industrial damage is particularlysevere, and among the more heavily damaged factories wdiich have been identifiedare works engaged on Textile Machinery, Optical Glass, Electrical Equipment andprobably on armaments.In addition many factories so far unidentified and many public buildings have been damaged or destroyed, and there are large areas of residential buildings which are still on fire.France.CaenICarrpiquet Airfield. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 13th July after the U.S.A.A.F. daylight attack on the 10th July, butincluding also seven previous attacks made by aircraft of Bomber and Fighter-Commands (after which no photographs were taken), showrs a large concentration of craters and damage to buildings in the immediate vicinity of the large doublerepair hangar on the Eastern boundary of the. airfield. A large building directlyeast has been hit by H.E. and a number of barracks nearby have been partly destroyed or severely damaged. Severe damage has been caused to at least onestorage unit of a bomb storage depot south-east of the landing ground, and manyhits were obtained on the N.W./S.E. runway and on the landing ground itself.Chocques. Photographs taken during the daylight attack on the 11th july show a heavy explosion in the power station resulting from at least one, andpossibly three, direct hits.Le Crexisot. -In the attack on the 19th/20th June both railway lines.(Roanne-Montchanin) were cut at several points near Montchanin Station.   Onthe Nevers-Chagny line both tracks were also cut and two trains were derailed.In addition, there was heavy damage to railway buildings and equipment.Amiens-Longueau. Photographs taken during the daylight attack on the4th July show that a stick of bombs has fallen across the forwarding sidings andanother across the east marshalling sidings of the Longueau Yard.[25756] &apos; n
La Pallice. Two ground sources report that, in the U.S.A.A.F. daylight attack on the 29th May, damage was caused to the new entrance lock under construction, as a result of which about three weeks&apos; delay in completion would be caused.Villacoublay A airfield. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 14th July after the U.S.A.A.F. attack earlier in the day shows approxi-niately 420 craters within the boundaries of the airfield. Very severe damage hasbeen caused to a large double hangar, where the remains of about 10 aircraft canbe seen amid the wreckage, to four single hangars and to two large workshops.18 craters can be seen on the main runway and.servicing tarmacs, and six cratersvery close to a three-gun site South-East of the damaged hangars. One direct hit has partly destroyed an aircraft shelter-West of the single hangars.Le Bourget Airfield. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 14th July after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the same day shows a very largenumber of craters concentrated along either side of the perimeter track betweenthe group of double hangars in the North-West corner and the five large hangarsin the East corner of the airfield. Two of these large hangars have been damaged and there are many craters on the taxi tracks and servicing tarmacs inthis area. Three smaller buildings due East of these hangars have also been severely damaged.Sea Mining.The following mining results have been received :- Mid-May. -A Sperrbrecher sustained internal damage due to sweeping a mine at the northern end of the Kattegat.Mid-May. Another was similarly damaged at the southern end of theKattegat a week later.23rd May.-Auxiliary S.V. Erna mined and sunk in Heligoland Bight.2&amp;th May.
