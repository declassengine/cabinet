THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  july 1943.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.   It is issued for the personal use of most SECRET. &apos; Copy No.W.P. (43) 332.23rd july, 1943.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.FOR the guidance of my colleagues, I circulate herewith the decisions reached by the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 22nd July, 1943 (W.M. (43) 102),regarding the distribution of man-power resources up to the end of 1943 : (1) The numbers of full-time workers in Civil Defence (including police and National Fire Service) should be reduced by a further 15,000before the end of 1943, in addition to the reduction of 75,000 now proceeding in accordance with the decision taken by the War Cabinetin. 1942.(2) Subject to (1) above, no further increase could be made in the estimateof 414,000 put forward in W.P. (43) 271 as the total numbers likelyto be available to meet the needs of the Services and essential industry during the nine months from the 1st April to the 31st December, 1943.The total supply of man-power during this period should thereforebe taken as 429,000.(3) Subject to (5) below, the allocations to the Army and the Royal AirForce for the period the 1st April to the 31st December, 1943, shouldbe 145,000 and 100,000 respectively.[25803]
(4) The allocation to the Navy for the same period should be 190,000. Thiswould meet in full the. balance of the allocation made to the navy in December 1942, and should also be regarded as meeting theadditional demand put forward by the Admiralty in respect of theman-power requirements of the Fleet itself.(5) The remaining balance of the Admiralty&apos;s additional demand was forthe manning of landing craft required for Combined Operations.These additional numbers could not be provided from the generalman-power pool and must be found, if at all, from the numbers alreadyallocated to the three Services.The Chiefs of Staff were invited to consider to what extent theadditional numbers demanded by the Admiralty for manning landing craft were in fact essential for the success of a forthcoming-operation; and how any additional numbers required should beprovided from among those already allocated to the three Services.(6) Special efforts must be made to expand the labour force working for theMinistry of Aircraft Production by 115,000 during the period the1st April to the 31st December, 1943. The additional numbers required would be obtained partly by a further reduction of the labour force working for the Ministry of Supply and partly by drawing intoaircraft production young women who would otherwise have gone intothe Services.For this purpose, the immediate introduction of the following measures was authorised : (a) Intake into the Women&apos;s Services to be reduced to a minimumby (i) stopping volunteering, save for. some special posts;(ii) not making any further age-groups of women subject to conscription under the National Service Acts for the timebeing; and (iii) appealing to women already accepted for theServices to go into aircraft factories until they were requiredin those Services.(&amp;) Women up to age 50, inclusive, to be registered for employment.(c) Ministry   of   Aircraft   Production   to   be  relieved  of   theirobligation to return to the Royal Air Force mechanics whowere lent to the aircraft industry. Those still in the industryto be allowed to remain there for the time being.(d) In general, men on Ministry of Aircraft Production work notto be called up for the Services for the time being. (Sea-going engineers required to man merchant ships built in theUnited States and assigned to this country should, however, be released.)(e) Reductions in the labour force working for the Ministry of supply to be carefully planned to take place as far as possible in areas where the Ministry of Labour can ensure that the labour
(7) In addition to these measures the Minister of Production, in conjunctionwith the other Ministers concerned, should endeavour to arrange blocktransfers of orders or capacity and machine tools between the Ministryof Supply and Ministry of Aircraft Production.(8) The Minister of Supply should aim at securing that the labour forceworking for&apos; his Department is reduced by a total of 185,000 duringthe period from the 1st April to the 31st December, 1943.(9) The labour force on Admiralty work should be increased by 50,000 duringthe period from the 1st April to the 31st December, 1943.(10) The Minister of Production should arrange to hold regular meetings with the Ministers of Labour, Supply and Aircraft Production andthe First Lord of the Admiralty with a view to keeping under continuous review the progress of these arrangements for transferringman-power and productive effort to aircraft production. The aim ofthese meetings would be to ascertain the most urgent man-power needsof the Ministry of Aircraft Production and to see that no possible means of meeting those needs was overlooked.(11) No more than 70,000 men and women would be available to meet therequirements of the other Essential Industries and Services, stated inthe Appendix to W.P. (43) 271 as totalling 102,000.The Lord President of the Council was authorised to distributea cut of 32,000 among the various industries and services included within this group.The Departments responsible for the industries and services inthis group should take steps to ensure that none of the industries and services for which they are responsible absorbs, before the end of 1943,man-power in excess of the numbers to be allocated to it by the lord president of the Council.(12) The arrangements set out by the Minister of Production in W.P. (43) 311for finding additional labour for the Government building programme during the months of August and September 1943 were approved.released is absorbed in Ministry of Aircraft Production work.For this purpose Ministry of Aircraft Production to make available statements showing where their labour intake isrequired up to the end of the year.The labour to be released from Ministry of Supply work must, to the greatest practicable extent, be mobile labour.(/) Regional Controllers of the Ministry of Labour to be instructedto make special efforts to fill Ministry of Aircraft Productionvacancies, and for this purpose Ministry of aircraft production to supply to the Ministry of Labour each month,through their Regional- Controllers, a list of firms whosevacancies must be filled during the month.
(13) The intakes into the Services, and the net changes in industry for theperiod from the 1st April to the 31st December, 1943, were approvedby the War Cabinet as follows : Thousands.Navy      .................. 190Army      .................. 145R.A.F................... 100Admiralty (shipbuilding, &amp;c.) ...       ...       ... 50Supply    .................. -185M.A.P................... 115Other essential industries and services        ... 70485Supply       ...      &apos;............ 429Deficit        ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 56(14) The administrative arrangements made by the Minister of Labour togive effect to this redistribution of man-power should be such as toensure that, if the supply up to the end of 1943 proved insufficient tomeet all the requirements set out in (13) above, the deficit should not fall on Ministry of Aircraft Production. The Services should not,therefore, be allowed to absorb the bulk of their authorised allocationsin the early part of the remaining period; and the expansion actuallyachieved in the Ministry of Aircraft Production labour force shouldbe carefully watched in relation to the remaining supply of man-powerlikely to be available.The Minister of Labour should report monthly to the War Cabinetthe results achieved towards the redistribution set out in (13) above;and the position would be subject to further review by the WarCabinet if at any time it seemed unlikely that, without additional measures, Ministry of Aircraft Production would not achieve their full expansion of 115,000 before the end of the year.**f-(15) Departments should estimate their requirements for 1944, and shouldbe ready to discuss possible plans, early in September 1943.10 downing  Street, S.W. 1,23rd July, 1943.W. S. C.&quot; Note.-By a decision of the War Cabinet on the 19th August, 1943 (W.M. (43)117th Conclusions, Minute 1), it was agreed that the first sentence of paragraph (14)should be modified so as to read : -&apos; In the administrative arrangements made to give effect to this redistribution of man-power every endeavour should be made to avoid a situation in which, if thesupply up to the end of 1943 proved insufficient to meet all the requirements set outin (13) above, the deficit would fall on the Ministry of Aircraft Production.&apos; &quot;
