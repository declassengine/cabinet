THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1943.Copy No. 3 34WAR CABINET.POST-WAR CIVIL AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.AT their meeting held on the 13th July* the War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion of the Canadian Governments objections to our proposals that, beforethe holding of an International Conference on Civil Air Transport with the americans and Russians, there should be a meeting between representatives ofthe Commonwealth Governments, and that the talks, both at the Conference and atthe preliminary meeting, should be on a ministerial level.2. I have discussed this question with my colleagues on the ministerial committee, who have agreed that. I should report to the War Cabinet asfollows : 3. We attach the highest importance to the maintenance of the principlethat before the Commonwealth Governments enter a Conference attended by representatives of the United States and U.S.S.R. (and perhaps also China),they should have reached the largest possible measure of agreement between themselves. We are satisfied that this result can be achieved satisfactorily only by the exchange of views orally between authorised representatives of theCommonwealth Governments, including those of India.4. At the same time, we are impressed with the desirability of avoidingsplitting the Commonwealth into two camps from the outset by arranging ameeting from which the Canadians would abstain. This would only emphasisemore clearly the solidarity of the Canadians with the American point of view and drive them into the arms of the United States.5. We feel, therefore, that a serious attempt should be made to obtain theagreement of the Canadian Government to a prior Commonwealth meeting, evenif this involves going some way to meet them over the status of the international conference.6. This should not present, insuperable difficulties. The Conference,although it is to be attended by the major Powers of the United Nations, cannot,in any case, reach final conclusions, since in these the French, the Dutch and other european, countries must eventually participate. The iimerican and Russianrepresentatives are moreover unlikely to be Ministers of Cabinet rank, by whomalone decisions binding on their Governments can be reached. The conference will therefore inevitably be of a consultative and exploratory character, most ofthe work of which, as happened at the Food Conference at Hot Springs, could appropriately be undertaken by officials working under general instructions fromtheir respective Governments. /&quot;V7. We recognise, however, that the leader of the United Kingdom Delega-tion should be of ministerial rank, both because it is important that he shouldbe of comparable status to the leader of the American Delegation, and becauseof the unfavourable impression which might be given to Parliament in thiscountry if a delegation without a ministerial leader were sent. But we thinkthat there is much to be said for selecting a junior Minister not of Cabinet rankSECRET.W.P. (43) 325.21st July, 1943.[25784]
to lead a delegation otherwise composed of officials. This would go some way tomeet the Canadian Government. Moreover, it will be recalled that a similar arrangement met with conspicuous success at the recent Food Conference.8. We might reasonably hope that the Canadian Government would agree toa proposal to this effect if it were put to them as a reasonable compromise designedto meet their objections to a Conference on the full ministerial level. It couldbe explained to them that our reason for insisting on a ministerial leader was due to the interest in the subject shown by members of all parties in both houses of Parliament in this country.9. If the Canadian Government accepted our new proposal we think thatthey should be pressed to agree on their side to participate in a prior meeting inLondon of Commonwealth and Indian representatives. We should propose thatthese should be the High Commissioners, with the addition of such technical advisers as they might wish to send. No announcement would be made before-hand of the calling of this meeting, nor would any press publicity be given toits deliberations. Arrangements would be made for the summoning of theproposed International Conference at Ottawa to meet at a date not more thana fortnight after the start of the consultations in London.10. If the War Cabinet agree to this plan, we suggest, that their decision should be conveyed to the Canadian Government in a letter from the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs to Mr. Vincent Massey, in reply to the latter&apos;communication of the 12th July.&apos;     C.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1.21st July, 1943.
