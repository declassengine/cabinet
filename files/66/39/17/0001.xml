THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (43) 317.18th July, 1943.WAR CABINET.ETHIOPIA.Memorandum by Secr:etary of State for Foreign Affairs&quot;.THE Deputy Minister of State in Cairo has suggested that the present agreement with Ethiopia (signed on the 31st January. 1942) should be denouncedand a fresh agreement negotiated in its stead giving His Majesty&apos;s Government(or possibly an Anglo-American Board) maximum means of control over theinternal -affairs of Ethiopia (Lord Moyne&apos;s telegrams Nos. 1591 and 1683developing these ideas are annexed, together with my telegram No. 317 to addis ababa to which reference is made).Arguments similar to those adduced by Lord Moyne in paragraph 2 of his telegram No. 1663 were examined by the Lord President of the CounciFsCommittee appointed in November 1941 to supervise the drafting of the present agreement [C.P.E. (41) 13 Final, also W.P. (41) 261]. Its report was submittedto the War Cabinet which approved the terms of the draft agreement[Conclusions 120 (41)].Before carrying my examination of Lord Moyne&apos;s suggestions further, Ipropose to ask him to give fuller shape to his ideas and to send him, with theMinister of State&apos;s concurrence, a telegram of which a draft is also annexedfor the information of my colleagues.Draft Telegram to Deputy Minister of State from Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.YOUR telegram No. 1663 [the 13th July : Ethiopia].Arguments similar to those adduced in paragraph 2 of your telegram were examined by the Lord President of the Council&apos;s Committee appointed to supervise the drafting of the terms of the present agreement.2. I am not yet sufficiently clear what you have in mind and I think it.would be useful if you were to rough out the headings for articles of an alter-native agreement such as you contemplate, counting the cost in money andman-power. At the same time I should be grateful if you would indicate &quot;wherein your view the present agreement has failed to serve our major interests andin what matters materially affecting us the Emperor has failed to keep hisengagements.3. We do not in any case favour idea of control by an Anglo-AmericanBoard.A. E.Foreign Office,18th July, 1943.ANNEX.I.[25770]
III.Deputy Minister of State, Cairo, to Mr. Eden. (Received 14th July, 2-10 a.m.)(Telegraphic.)(No. 1663.  Immediate.) Cairo, 13th July, 1943, 6-50 p.m.FOLLOWING  for  Secretary  of  State  and  Minister  of  State  fromMo.....  :-I am gravely disturbed at the assumption in Foreign Office telegram No. 317to Addis Ababa and Addis Ababa telegram No. 549 to Foreign Office that it is amatter of indifference to His Majesty&apos;s Government whether Ethiopia is well orill governed.2. I believe a reasonably good administration in Ethiopia is essential to uson the following grounds : (a) We have a moral duty to see that the people of the country are notoppressed and enslaved. When we are fighting for freedom in Europehow can we restore Gallas and other subject races to Amharic tyranny ?(b) If we permit a return to disorder and injustice the results of our conquestwill be sharply contrasted with the law and order and materialimprovements achieved by the Italians.(c) It may well prove that the issue is not one between good and bad govern-ments, but between good government and no government at all.Deputy Minister of State, Cairo, to Mr. Eden. (Received 4th July, 9-35 p.m.)(Telegraphic.)(No. 1591.   Immediate.) Cairo, 4th July, 1943, 5-10 p.m.FOLLOWING, personal, for Minister of State from Lord Moyne :-Arguments in paper on Ethiopia drawn up by the War Council Committee(125 W.C. (43) 26) have been reinforced by developments revealed in recent telegrams from Addis Ababa, particularly telegram No. 517 to Foreign Office. Itis evident that the Emperor is not playing. British Advisers and Military Missionare the sole props of civilised administration in Ethiopia and, if this structure isdestroyed, it will be impossible to rebuild.2. We have discussed matters here,, and I strongly recommend advantage should be taken of your presence in London to consider the desirability ofdenouncing Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement with a view to effecting a fresh agreementproviding for our long-term objectives with maximum possible control. control could be exercised by an Anglo-American Board. The Americans might thus be induced to share the burden of finance and provision of administrative man-power.Tigre could be placed under a separate administration as proposed in War CouncilCommittee, unless control of the whole of Ethiopia were sufficiently satisfactory to render this unnecessary.3.   At the present time we hold various inducements in our hands, e.g. : (a) Continuance of financial support, which has already been promisedconditionally.(b) Continued provision of civilised man-power, of which we and the UnitedStates at present have the monopoly.(c) Our ability to back Ethiopian claims to Assab and Danakil Coast and[group undecypherable :   ? North] Tigre.The Emperor should be brought to realise that his territorial claims wouldbe ruled out. By failure of her own administration Ethiopia cannot guaranteesecurity and economic life to territories she wishes to annex.4. In return for concessions on these lines, we could demand satisfaction of our requirements in regard to Lake Tsana and frontier readjustments advocated by the Sudan and [group unclecypherable :  ? Colonial Office].5. Middle East Supply Centre are hoping to work up to 100,000 tons ofwheat and 4,000 tons of rubber from Ethiopia In 1944, but this is dependent on thecontinuance of our influence.6. We suggest the time has come to take drastic action as described above,and we hope that it may be authorised.(Repeated to Addis Ababa.)
id) It would be impossible to justify at peace conference the cession ofDanakil and Tigre to a regime of tyranny, and mal-administration,and main inducement for attainment of our long-term interests (TsanaDam and frontier adjustments) would thus be lost.(e) I am convinced that if we do not insist now, when we have the power,upon a satisfactory administration we shall some day be compelledto do so at a far greater cost in life and money.3. I cannot believe that complete indifference to the quality of the govern-ment in Ethiopia is implied in our present policy, and I am surprised att suggestion in Foreign Office telegram under reference that advisory system is not&apos;K [group undecypherable : ? appropriate] in British as in Ethiopian countries.Nor do I see any inconsistency between Anglo-Ethiopian agreement and&apos; our long-term object but their independent state. Indeed, it is only by faithfulperformance of the first that we could hope to attain the second.4. Nevertheless, recent events in Ethiopia have convinced me that we are unlikely to attain by our present policy a government good enough to achieve the objects in paragraph 2 above. The present impasse with advisers, thedevastating report of Willan, the refusal of Goodman Roberts and other lawyerswho have been approached to accept the presidency of the High Court are allsymptomatic of present dissatisfaction on this matter.5. It is against the above background that I have considered alternatives in mr. Howe&apos;s telegram No. 549. There is little to choose between the prospects heholds out that we might retain agreement but not seek to enforce it, or that we might dispense altogether with agreement and leave the Emperor entirely to hisown devices. Either of these courses would, in my opinion, be a surrender notonly fatal to our long-term interests, but also to our immediate need for supplies.6. I do not share Mr. Howe&apos;s doubts whether drastic action is justified, butI do doubt whether the adequacy of the action can be taken within framework of present agreement. That is why I suggested in my telegram No. 1591 that weshould seek a new one with stronger sanctions. So far from this exposing us to criticism I believe original effect of grant of Ethiopian independence in allayingsuspicion as to our self-interested motives would be reinforced if we could bringUnited States into partnership.7. Whatever your view may be of proposal in&apos;paragraph 6 I earnestly hopestronger action will be taken than is suggested in either of the telegrams under reference, and that meantime laisser faire will be abandoned before administra-tion [group undecypherable]s beyond repair.8. I have ventured to put my views thus strongly before you in the hope thatthe issues can receive some further consideration before Mr. Casey leaves London.(Repeated to Addis Ababa, telegram No. 105.)(Copies sent to Minister of State.)* IV.Mr Eden to Mr. Hoiue [Addis Ababa).(Telegraphic.)(No. 317.) Foreign Office, 3rd July, 1943, 12-45 a.m.YOUR telegram No. 476 [of 18th June : Advisers].I am not unmindful of the Advisers&apos; difficulties in the circumstances andappreciate the conscientious motives behind their desire to accelerate reforms.It is, however, desirable in the wider British interest that they should curb theirpropensity to rush matters to the point of reaching a complete impasse, of whichthere seems to be some danger.2. I detect a misconception in your telegram under reference and in otherrecent telegrams on this subject, viz., that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment with regard to Ethiopia has undergone modification. This is not - so.His Majesty&apos;s Government took the decision to restore Ethiopia to its nativeruler with full appreciation of all the factors involved, including the fact thatin this case self-government would not necessarily mean good government. Bythis we, and the Advisers with us, must stand. The country must be allowed towork out its own destiny. The Advisers were chosen at the Emperors expresswish, and it is his duty in his country&apos;s interest to utilise their services to thebest advantage. The syllogism with which you end your telegram is false. Thesystem of advisers in Ethiopia is a cardinal point, not of British, but ofEthiopian policy.
3. I agree with your paragraph 4. Indeed, the Advisers selected in Londonfit fairly closely with your ideas. If the present team should break up abruptlyit will be for consideration then how, if at all, it should and can be replaced, butI am hopeful that the present crisis will not reach this pitch. Therefore, whilstthere are cogent reasons why you should not intervene directly in the dispute between the Advisers and the Emperor, I think there might be some advantage in your taking an early opportunity of drawing the Emperor&apos;s attention to article, IV (c) of the Agreement and of telling him that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might have cause to question the desirability of continuing their financial aid in circumstances where co-operation between the Ethiopianauthorities and his Advisers regarding public expenditure, of which the budget is the proper measure, appears to be lamentably absent. I have, moreover, aresidual responsibility to Parliament with regard to the proper spending of thefinancial aid given to Ethiopia. It is therefore important that the Emperorshould in his own interest use his authority with no uncertainty to gethis country&apos;s finances put into decent shape in accordance with therecommendation of his Financial Adviser.(Repeated to Deputy Minister of State, Cairo, No. 2085.)(Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong.)
