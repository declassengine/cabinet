(43) 339.26th July, 1943.WAR CABINET.THOUGHTS ON THE FALL OF MUSSOLINI.By the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.1. It seems highly probable that the fall of Mussolini will involve the overthrow of the Fascist regime, and that the new Government of the King andBadoglio will seek to negotiate a separate peace with the Allies. Should thisprove to be the case, it will be necessary for us to make up our minds first ofall upon what we want, and secondly upon the measures and conditions requiredto gain it for us.2. At this moment above all others, our thoughts must be concentrated upon the supreme aim, namely, the destruction of Hitler, Hitlerism and NaziGermany. Every military advantage arising out of the surrender of Italy (should that occur) must be sought for this purpose.3. The first of these is, in the Presidents words, &quot; the control of all italian territory and transportation against the Germans in the north and againstthe whole Balkan Peninsula, as well as the use of airfields of all kinds.&quot; this must include the surrender to our garrisons of Sardinia, the Dodecanese andCorfu, as well as of all the naval and air bases in the Italian mainland as soonas they can be taken over.4. Secondly, and of equal importance, the immediate surrender to the allies of the Italian Fleet or at least its effective demobilisation and paralysis and thedisarmament of the Italian Air and ground forces to whatever extent we find[25817]
needful and useful. The surrender of the Fleet will liberate powerful british naval forces for service in the Indian Ocean against Japan, and will be mostagreeable to the United States.5. Also, of equal consequence, the immediate withdrawal from or surrender of all Italian forces in Corsica, the Riviera including Toulon, and the BalkanPeninsula, to wit in Yugoslavia, Albania and Greece.6. Another objective of the highest importance, about which there will bepassionate feeling in this country, is the immediate liberation of all british prisoners of war in Italian hands and the prevention, which can in the firstinstance only be by the Italians, of their being transported northwards toGermany. I regard it as a matter of honour and humanity to get our own fleshand blood back as soon as possible and spare them the measureless horrors ofincarceration in Germany during the final stages of the war.7. The fate of the German troops in Italy, and particularly of those southof Rome, will probably lead to fighting between the Germans and the Italian armyand population. We should demand their surrender, and that any ItalianGovernment with whom we can reach a settlement shall do their utmost to procurethis. It may be, however, that the German divisions will cut their waynorthwards in spite of anything that the Italian armed forces are capable of doing. We should provoke this conflict as much as possible, and should not hesitate to send troops and Air support to assist the Italians in procuring the surrender of the Germans south of Rome.8. When we see how this process goes, we can take a further view aboutaction to be taken north of Rome. We should, however, try to get possession of points on both the west coast and east coast railways of Italy as far north aswe dare.  And this is a time to dare.9. In our struggle with Hitler and the German army we cannot afford to deny ourselves any assistance that will kill Germans. The fury of the Italianpopulation will now be turned against the German intruders who have, as theywill feel, brought all these miseries upon Italy and then come so scantily andgrudgingly to her aid. We should stimulate this process in order that the newliberated anti-Fascist Italy shall afford us at the earliest moment a safe and friendly area on which we can base the whole forward Air attack upon South and central Germany.10. This Air attack is a new advantage of the first order, as it brings thewhole of the Mediterranean Air forces into action from a direction which turnsthe entire line of Air defences in the West, and which furthermore exposes all those centres of war production which have been increasingly developed to escapeAir attack from Great Britain. It will become urgent in the highest degree to getagents, Commandos and supplies by sea across the Adriatic into Greece, Albaniaand Yugoslavia. It must be remembered that there are 15 German divisions inthe Balkan Peninsula of which 10 are mobile.   Nevertheless once we have control )
of the Italian Peninsula and of the Adriatic, and the Italian armies in the balkans withdraw or lay down their arms, it is by no means unlikely that the Hunwill be forced to withdraw northwards to the line of the Save and Danube, thusliberating Greece and other tortured countries.11. We cannot yet measure the effects of Mussolini&apos;s fall and of an Italiancapitulation, upon Bulgaria, Rumania and Hungary. They may be profound.In connection with this situation the collapse of Italy should fix the moment for putting the strongest pressure on Turkey to act in accordance with the spirit ofthe Alliance, and in this Britain and the United States, acting jointly or severally,should if possible be joined or at least supported by Russia.12. The surrender of, to quote the President, &apos;&apos; the head devil togetherwith his partners in crime &quot; must be considered an eminent object and one forwhich we should strive by all means in our power short of wrecking the immenseprospects which have been outlined in earlier paragraphs. It may be, however,that these criminals will flee into Germany or escape into Switzerland. On theother hand, they may surrender themselves or be surrendered by the ItalianGovernment. Should they fall into our hands, we ought now to decide in con-sultation with the United States and after agreement with them with the U.S.S.R.what treatment should be meted out to them. Some may prefer prompt executionwithout trial except for identification purposes. Others may prefer that they be kept in confinement till the end of the war in Europe, and their fate decidedtogether with that of other war criminals. Personally I am fairly indifferent onthis matter, provided always that no solid military advantages are sacrificed forthe sake of immediate vengeance.13. I append telegrams exchanged between me and the President of theUnited States.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,26^ July, 1943.Prime Minister to President Roosevelt. 26/7/43.(No. 382.)Changes announced in Italy probably portend Peace proposals. Let usconsult together so as to take joint action. The present stage may only betransition. But anyhow, Hitler will feel very lonely when Mussolini is down and out.   No one can be quite sure this may not go farther.
President Roosevelt to the Prime Minister. 26/7/43.(No. 324.)By coincidence I was again at Shangri La this afternoon when the news fromRome came, but this time it seems to be true. If any overtures come we must be certain of the use of all Italian territory and transportation against the germans in the North and against the whole Balkan Peninsula, as well as use of airfields ofall kinds. It is my thought that we should come as close as possible to uncon-ditional surrender, followed by good treatment of the Italian populace. But Ithink also that the Head Devil should be surrendered together with his chiefpartners in crime. In no event should our officers in the field fix on any general terms without your approval and mine.  Let me have your thoughts.
