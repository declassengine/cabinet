naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Allied ships have carried out bombardments in support of the armies in sicily.Light craft have torpedoed an Italian cruiser, and have successfully attackedE-boats in the Straits of Messina.H.M. Ships Indomitable and Cleopatra have been torpedoed but reachedMalta.Six U-boats have been sunk, two probably sunk, four possibly sunk, fourprobably damaged and one possibly damaged.Shipping casualties have been moderate.Home Waters.2. Early on the morning of the 17th our light forces attacked a convoy &quot;ofthree coasters escorted by two trawlers off the Dutch coast, and probably sank oneof them. Later two or more enemy ships from Ijmuiden opened fire on the four ships remaining from the convoy and probably damaged two others.On the following night our light forces unsuccessfully attacked a northboundconvoy in the same area.   Slight damage was sustained by our forces.Three Norwegian fishing vessels which were encountered by two NorwegianM.T.Bs. off Fiord (Norway) were brought into Lerwick on the 21st.North Atlantic.3. On the 21st H.M.C.S. The Pas (corvette), escorting an outward bound convoy, was seriously damaged in collision.Mediterranean.4. An inshore squadron of monitors, gunboats and other small craft hassupported the Eighth Army. U.S. cruisers and destroyers have supported; the seventh Army.5. On the 16th H.M-S. Sirius (cruiser) bombarded Catania Bay, and U.S.cruisers with H.M.S. A bercrombie (monitor) bombarded Empedocle andAgrigento. H.M.S. Roberts (monitor) sustained damage while bombarding. Onthe 17th H.M.S. Warspite bombarded Catania town while destroyers engagedcoastal batteries. On the 18th and 19th Catania was again bombarded bycruisers and monitors, while destroyers attacked troop movements on the Messinacoastal road, and gunboats attacked targets in the western approaches to Catania.On the 20th and 21st the inshore squadron continued to bombard selected targets in the Catania area and early on the 21st cruisers and destroyers bombardedCotrone.   Chemical works were hit and fires were started in the harbour..6. Light craft have been active in Sicilian waters. On the night of the 15thM.T.Bs. engaged six E-boats in the Straits of Messina. One E-boat was sunk,one probably sunk and the remainder seriously damaged. Two M.T.Bs. were damaged. H.M.S. Tetcott (destroyer) drove off E-boats which were attackingshipping off Augusta and sank one of them. On the night of the 18th/19thM.T.Bs. damaged two E-boats in the Straits of Messina. One M.T.B. was damaged.H.M.S. Ilex (destroyer) destroyed one enemy bomber.7. On the 15th a Regolo-class cruiser was reported by aircraft west ofNaples steering south-east at high: speed. Early on the 17th, M.T.Bs. in theStraits of Messina claimed one torpedo hit on this cruiser, which was alsoengaged by Italian coastal batteries.  One M.T.B. was sunk.8. H.M.S. Indomitable (aircraft carrier) was torpedoed by aircraft on the16th east of Malta. She was hit in a boiler room, but was able to proceed at14^ knots to Malta. On the same clay H.M.S. Cleopatra (cruiser) was torpedoed bya U-boat north-east of Malta, but reached port. On the night of the 19th/20thH.M.S. Nubian (destroyer) was slightly damaged during an air raid on Malta.9. On the 17th an advanced coastal force and landing craft base ^was established at Augusta. On the 18th, six ships arrived and 1,000 tons of materialwere discharged.    Fuel tanks appeared to be sound and a valuable store of
torpedoes and boom gear was found serviceable. There has been considerableenemy air activity over Augusta. On the night of the 16th/17th H.M.S. QueenEmma (infantry landing ship) was seriously damaged, and there were 90casualties, of which the majority were R.M. Commandos. On the following night KLM.S. Cockchafer (gunboat) shot down one aircraft.The discharge of supplies on beaches in the Avola sector was expected tobe completed by noon on the 21st; the beaches were then to be closed at noon onthe 22nd. It is reported that on one small beach in South-East Sicily 2,000 tons were landed in one day last week.A survey of Syracuse on the 15th showed that there were 14 serviceablewooden lighters (of which eight were ready for use), five motor schooners (of&quot;which two were ready for use), one motor launch and one steam tug. On the night of the 15th/ 16th H.M. Minesweepers Boston and Poole were slightly damaged and sustained some casualties during an air raid on Syracuse.In the western sector it is estimated that at Licata 650 tons can be dischargeddaily, and at Empedocle 800 tons; at Gela only 100 tons can be handled daily.10. On the 16th a large explosion occurred in a ship which was being loaded with mines and other enemy war material in Algiers harbour. The ship wasblown in half and sank, and another ship which was loading drummed petrol inan adjacent dock was set on fire, towed out of harbour and beached. considerable damage and casualties resulted.11. For the Sicilian operation 30 personnel ships were handled at Haifaand Beirut and 30 others at Alexandria; at Suez 23 personnel ships were handled.At Alexandria and Suez 15 tank landing ships were loaded. The tank landing craft convoy loaded at Benghazi involved the movement of 2,600 personnel and650 vehicles by rail to Tobruk and thence by road to Benghazi. Six thousand eighthundred men and 1,360 vehicles were ferried from Tripoli to Malta and thenceto Sicily. In all 77,000 personnel, 11,400 vehicles and 36,000 tons of stores wereembarked from Eastern Mediterranean ports in excess of the usual shippingprogramme, and exclusive of the division embarked from Sfax and Sousse underthe aegis of the North African Command.12.   The following attacks by H.M. Submarines have been reported : Between27th June and 3rd July Trident sank three caiques in the Dodecanese,and on the 4th torpedoed a 3,500-ton escorted ship.On the 7th Rorqual sank an escorted tanker off the Dardanelles.On the 14th Unshaken sank a 500-ton schooner off Cotrone.Taurus sank a tug and 15 caiques in the y gean. She bombarded Kastro,Neaplayia and Potardia.Pacific.Solomons.13. H.M. New Zealand Cruiser Leander was torpedoed on the night of the12th/13th in the action off the Kula Gulf which was reported in last week&apos;resume. Examination of the ship after reaching port showed that her structuralstrength was unimpaired and main engines undamaged.On the night of the 17th/18th Allied. Naval forces engaged three Japanesedestroyers off Kolombangara Island in the Solomons. All three ships were hit and one is believed to have been sunk.During the week Allied aircraft have sunk one or two light cruisers, four destroyers and one submarine chaser. One destroyer was probably sunk andthree were damaged.   (Details are given in the Air Situation.)On the 16th the U.S.S. Chincoteaque (seaplane tender), was seriously damaged by aircraft at Anikoro Island.A leutian Islands. -14. On the 14th and 15th U.S. light surface craft bombarded enemy positions on Kiska Island.Anti-Submarine Operations.15. Thirty-six attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week 25 by aircraft and. 11 by surface craft and submarines.Two U-boats were sunk by aircraft from U.S.S. Core (auxiliary aircraft carrier) in mid-Atlantic. H.M.S. Mignonette rammed and sank a U-boat offthe Canary Islands. A U.S. naval aircraft sank a U-boat south of Rio de Janeiro.[25797] . B
A U.S. Liberator (B. 24) and a Halifax sank a U-boat in the Biscay area. an italian U-boat was sunk by H.M. Submarine United in the Gulf of Taranto.A U-boat was probably sunk by a Liberator (B. 24) off Cape Finisterre, andanother was probably sunk off the coast of French Guiana by a U.S. aircraft.A U-boat was possibly sunk by an aircraft east of the Azores, and an ItalianU-boat was possibly sunk by H.M. Submarine Unmdy north of Sicily. A Japaneseor German U-boat was possibly sunk by a Hudson in the Gulf of Aden. Allieddestroyers possibly sank a Japanese U-boat in the Kula Gulf (Solomons). ThreeItalian U-boats were probably damaged by aircraft in the Mediterranean, and aGerman U-boat was probably damaged by aircraft off the Portuguese coast.Light craft possibly damaged an Italian U-boat in the Straits of Messina.Enemy Intelligence.German.16. Reconnaissance of Bergen on the 18th showed that the cruiserKonigsberg has been put on an even keel but is still partly submerged.There are indications that the blockade-runner Himalaya (6,240 tons) mayattempt to break out of Bordeaux in the near future.Italian.17. There has been no change in the disposition of the Italian battleships.A new Regolo class cruiser left Ancona, where she has been fitting out, and reached Taranto on the 18th. There are now three of these cruisers in corn-mission; one at Spezia under repair, and another which moved from Spezia toTaranto during the week, and was attacked in the Straits of Messina.Japanese.18. On the 15th two aircraft carriers,&apos; one auxiliary aircraft carrier, oneseaplane carrier, two cruisers and a number of destroyers were sighted north ofTruk on a southerly course.In the New Guinea-Solomons area no Japanese warships larger than light cruisers have been sighted.On the 1st July the effective strength of the Japanese fleet was estimated to consist of four 16-in. battleships, six 14-in. battleships, thirteen 8-in. cruisers,18 light cruisers, three aircraft carriers, four seaplane carriers, three convertedaircraft carriers, 17 converted seaplane carriers and aircraft ferries, 96 destroyers and about 90 U-boats.U-boats.1.9. About 80 U-boats are at present at sea in the Atlantic and IndianOceans. There has been little U-boat activity in the Mediterranean consideringthe nature of the current operations. The number of U-boats at Kiel hassteadily increased during the last six months, and is at present about 40. ThreeItalian U-boats are believed to be engaged in blockade-running and to be ontheir way to the Far East.Enemy Attack on Shipping.20. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked five ships, ofwhich two are known to have sunk.One ship in an outward bound convoy was torpedoed off the CanaryIslands, and one ship in a homeward bound convoy was torpedoed off the GambiaRiver. Two ships sailing independently were sunk south of Lagos and offMozambique and another was torpedoed off the East African coast.Three ships were sunk in air raids on Augusta and two ships were lost inAlgiers harbour as the result of an explosion. ;A homeward bound troop convoy was twice unsuccessfully attacked byF.W. aircraft off the coast of Portugal.Protection of Seaborne Trade.21. During the week ending the 18th, 907 ships were convoyed. Of these181 were in ocean convoys and 726 in British coastal convoys.Seventy-five destroyers (including 15 U.S. destroyers), 115 sloops, frigates,cutters and corvettes (including eight U.S. cutters and one French sloop), threeescort carriers and one ocean boarding vessel, were employed on escort duties.
Two ocean convoys, consisting of 70 ships, arrived in Home Waters,without loss.22. During the week ending the 17th, imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 1,030,000 tons, compared with 947,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 961,000 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 326,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.British Minelaying.23. During the week aircraft laid mines on a small scale in the Bay of biscay.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.24. There have been no reports of enemy minelaying by either surface craft or aircraft during the week.. No E-boat minelaying has taken place forthree weeks, and except for a doubtful report of minelaying by aircraft in theYarmouth area on the 30th June, it is over five weeks since mines are known tohave been laid by enemy aircraft.The area off Start Point has been cleared, a total of 21 mines having been destroyed in it.   Twelve ground mines have been destroyed off the East Coast.The mine totals are 4,424 ground and 3,005 moored.25. The port of Augusta was closed for a short time on the 17th owingto suspected aircraft minelaying, but it was reopened after a small dangerousarea had been declared inside the harbour.Minelaying by enemy aircraft may have taken place in the entrance to theValetta harbours at Malta on the night of the 19th/20th.Enemy Merchant Shipping.26. Shipments of iron ore from Bilbao to Bordeaux and Bayonne showed a further considerable fall during June. The quantity shipped was approximately 22,000 tons, against 41,000 in May and 64,000 and 58,000 for the peak months this year. This large reduction is mainly due to the suspension of spanish export licences for high class ores.MILITARY SITUATION.Sicily.27. During the past week the Fifteenth Army Group has extended the firm bridgehead, with its attendant ports and airfields, which it has seized in thesouth-east corner of Sicily, and has now occupied half the island.At sea the Royal Navy have given great assistance by bombarding coastaltargets ahead of the advancing troops. Convoys have been unloading for somedays at Syracuse, and Augusta, where damage to the harbour installations wasslight, though work has been hindered by a large fire at the former, and thetemporary lack of light and water at the latter. Maintenance over the beacheshas been satisfactory and some of them have now been closed.More than 40,000 prisoners, of whom the majority are Italians, have nowbeen taken; their morale is extremely low.Eighth Army.28. The Eighth Army was directed along two lines of advance, one north-wards up the east coast through Catania, the other north-westwards throughEnna with the object of cutting the east-west routes across the island and sosplitting the enemy forces, whilst the Seventh Army on the left moved north-west-wards. Considerable progress has been made, but when the main enemy forces were encountered the rate of the advance was slowed up, places have changedhands several times before being finally secured and very heavy fighting is takingplace on ;the Eighth Army front against German forces south of Catania.The British paratroops, who were dropped on the night of the 13th/14th,and who seized the important bridge of Ponte di Primo Sole, made it possible fora firm bridgehead to be formed over the Gornalunga River seven miles south ofCatania, for ^although owing to shortage of ammunition they were forced towithdrew at 1930 hours on the 14th, they had removed the demolition charges and[25797] b 2
the advancing infantry were able to seize the bridge intact the following morning.At that time lines of communications were stretched and the inevitable shortageof transport slowed down movement, thus on the morning of the 14th german troops counter-attacked at Augusta and had a brief success. Further Britishattacks north of Ponte di Primo Sole made little progress, an attack on the night of the 7th/18th failing after reaching its objectives on the Fossa Bottaceto,although the enemy suffered heavy casualties; very fierce fighting continued in this sector.Meanwhile further to the west other elements of Eighth Army seized Scordiaand Militello on the 15th, formed two &quot;more bridgeheads over the Gornalunga onthe 18th and have continued their advance.On the left flank the Canadian thrust north-westwards has been highly successful, although fighting has often been fierce. Grammichele, Caltagirone,Piazza Armerina were in turn captured; Valguernera fell on the 19th, and despite delays caused by demolitions and mortar fire Enna and Leonforte werein their hands on the 20th. Enna, in the centre of the island, is the nodal pointof east to west and north to south communications; its capture is therefore ofsome significance.By the evening of the 21st the Eighth Army front extended from the bridge-head north of Ponte di Primo Sole westwards along the River Simeto, which hasbeen crossed at several points, along the railway to Catenanuova thence to Agira,Leonforte and Enna.Seventh Army.29. The Seventh Army has made considerable advances northwards andwestwards.In the right sector U.S. troops fought their way through hilly countrymaking contact with the Canadian left flank, which they now cover as far asEnna. They captured Caltanissetta on the-18th, entered Caterina unopposed onthe sarne^ day, and Villarosa on the 19th. Continuing their advance north and north-west, by the evening of the 21st they had captured Alimena and Vallelunga.In the left sector U.S. troops captured Agrigento on the 17th,Porto Empedocle having been entered the previous day by U.S. Rangers after a naval bombardment; the possession of this port with the consequent increaseduse of Licata greatly facilitated the landing of reinforcements and supplies. Onthe 19th French Goums operating in the centre occupied Mussomeli. By the afternoon of the 21st U.S. troops, continuing to&apos; advance north and north-west,had occupied Prizzi, St. Margherita and had reached to within three miles south-east of Castel Vetrano, which they have now taken.The advance continues along the entire Seventh Army front.The Russo-German Campaign.Orel Sector.30. On the 15th the Russians announced that they had launched an attack in the previous few days towards Orel from north and east. The attack from thenorth was made on a front of 25 miles, and in three days the Russians had penetrated to a depth of 28 miles. By the 18th the attack was on a frontage ofover 65 miles and had reached within 34 miles of Orel. On the 20th the Russiansclaimed the capture of Mtsensk.East of Orel the Russians attacked on a frontage of 20 miles, and by the18th had reached to within 19 miles of Orel.These Russian attacks evidently had the effect of forcing the Germans towithdraw reserves from the point of penetration which they had made in theprevious week south of Orel. Here the Russians have driven the Germans backto the line they held before the opening of their offensive on the 5th and claim tobe still advancing.Byelgorod Sector.31. By the 15th&apos;the German attack north of Byelgorod had lost itsmomentum. For some days there was little activity in this area, but the Russiansnow claim to have attacked and made an advance of seven to eight miles.Donetz-Mius Sector.32. On the 18th the Germans reported Russian attacks in the Lower Donetzand Mius Sector.   These attacks have now been in progress for some days, but
their scope is not yet. clear. The Russians appear to have made some localadvances, but the purpose of the operations may only be to probe the Germandefences and prevent the Germans from sending reinforcements to the Orel Sector.Taman Bridgehead.33. There has been a renewal of Russian attacks in the Taman Bridgehead,but they do not appear to have been on a large scale nor to have resulted in any important changes of position.South-West Pacific.New Guinea.34. The Mubo area has now been cleared of Japanese. An Australian force from Observation Hill made contact with U.S. forces advancing from NassauBay, cutting off north-east of Mubo an enemy force estimated at 1,250, whileanother Australian force, operating on the track leading south from Salamaua,prevented the enemy from sending reinforcements.By the 14th all organised enemy resistance had been overcome. enemy casualties are estimated at 950.   Our casualties are reported to be slight.Further fighting is now reported in the neighbourhood of Komiatum, about five miles north-north-east of Mubo.South Pacific.Solomons.35. Further U.S. landings have been made on the north-west coast of NewGeorgia, and U.S. forces are now closing in on Munda airfield from the south-east and north-west; the Southern force is now within two miles of the airfield.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. Aircraft of Bomber Command attacked the Peugeot motor works at&apos;Montbeliard (35 miles west of Basle) and transformer stations in Northern Italy.Allied air superiority was maintained over Sicily. Heavy attacks were madeon Naples, Rome and Messina, and on Italian airfields.Successful attacks were made on Japanese shipping in the Solomons.United Kingdom.37. At night eight enemy aircraft were reported over S.E. England. no enemy aircraft crossed our coast in daylight. .  ^ .Coastal Operations..38. Beaufighters, Hurricanes and Spitfires made several attacks pn enemy shipping; a 2,000rton ship was set on fire off the Norwegian Coast and four ships totalling about 3,500 tons were damaged off the Dutch Coast.Sixteen Wellingtons of Bomber Command laid 32 mines in enemy waters.During these operations six enemy aircraft were, shot down; six of our aircraft are missing.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.39. On the 17th, a total of 330 Fortresses (B. 17) were despatched to attackfactories in North-West Germany and the Fokker aircraft factory at Amsterdam.Although the aircraft were recalled owing to unfavourable weather conditions,21 aircraft dropped 53 tons of bombs on the aircraft factory and 31 dropped72 tons on other targets. In combat, 60 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 16 were probably destroyed and .36 were damaged; one Fortress (B. 17) is missing andanother crashed in the sea.Escorted medium, light and fighter bombers attacked airfields at Abbevilleand Poix and railway targets in Northern France and Belgium, including therailway centre at Abbeville. In these operations and on fighter sweeps, 15 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of 11 Allied fighters (one pilot safe).
Night.Out of 165 Halifaxes despatched, 157 attacked the Peugeot motor works at Montbeliard, dropping 391 tons of bombs in good weather conditions.Photographs taken on the following day show that the works were severely damaged (see Appendix VI).   Five Halifaxes are missing.Mosquitoes made two small-scale attacks on Munich.Intruders attacked airfields and railway targets in France, the Low countries and North-West Germany; 30 locomotives and a goods train were damaged andan enemy aircraft was shot down. Leaflets w7ere dropped on several towns inFrance.   One aircraft is missing.Northern Italy.40. A total of 40 Lancasters of Bomber Command bombed transformer andswitching stations near Milan and Bologna on two successive nights, dropping123 tons of bombs with good results. Two other Lancasters successfully attackedSpezia harbour and barracks at Genoa.   Three Lancasters are missing.Mediterranean.Sicily.41. The Allied superiority over the Sicilian theatre enabled our land and sea forces to operate with little interference.Our fighter units operated from captured airfields on the Island. Strongoffensive patrols were maintained over the forward areas, particularly on theGerbini-Catania front, and cover was also provided over beaches and harbours,but enemy opposition showed a marked decrease and by day only 14 enemy aircraft were destroyed. On the 19th Bocca Di Falco near Palermo was reported to be theonly serviceable enemy airfield on the Island. -Fighter-bombers and medium and light bombers maintained a heavy scale of effort against focal points and enemy communications. In the Catania area fourbig raids were made on Randazzo and three on the town of Catania; Paterno wasalso bombed. Other heavy attacks were made on Enna, Palermo and Termini and considerable damage was reported.Large formations of Lightnings (P. 38), Mustangs (A. 36), and Kittyhawks(P. 40) made widespread harassing attacks on enemy communications, as a resultof which numerous M.T. vehicles and rolling-stock were destroyed, and bridges,raihvay centres, cross-roads and other military targets were damaged. At nightthese attacks were carried out by Bostons (A. 20) and Baltimores (A. 30). a formation of Lightnings (P. 38), assisting in an air sea rescue operation off UsticaIsland, intercepted and destroyed 15 Ju. 52.A heavy daylight attack by 265 bombers was made on Messina and two otherson a small scale were made by night. A total of over 600 tons of bombs was dropped and considerable damage was caused to the railway centre, the harbour and in the oil storage area.  Nine of the bombers are missing.Enemy twin-engine fighters and fighter-bombers were employed against shipping off Sicily; Augusta was attacked on three nights and three of our ships were sunk. Night fighters from Malta w7ere very successful and shot down 41enemy aircraft.Italy.42. Two of the heaviest daylight operations of the war were carried out against Rome and Naples.Naples Harbour and Railway centre and two local airfields at PomiglianoD&apos;Arco and Capodichino were bombed on the night of the 14th/15th and on three other nights, by a total of 2*04 Wellingtons. On the 15th and 17th attacks were made by 433 heavy and medium bombers, and the total bombs released inall these operations amounted to 1,200 tons. Enemy opposition on a compara-tively high scale was encountered and 26 enemy fighters were shot down, and Allied bombers are missing. The damage caused was very considerable; hits were obtained on the Royal Arsenal and the torpedo factory, and the smoke fromfires rose to 21,000 feet; the railway centre wasscompletely unserviceable and fires were still burning in the oil refinery two days after it was attacked. badly damaged aircraft, of which a number were burnt out, were observed in all partsof the airfields. .
On the 19th 150 Fortresses (B. 17) and 115 Liberators (B. 24) bombed theSan Lorenzo and Littorio railway marshalling yards at Rome. A total of249 Mitchells (B. 25) and Marauders (B. 26) escorted by Lightnings (P. 38)attacked local airfields at Ciampino. The previous night Wellingtons dropped864,000 leaflets. Reaction from enemy fighters, three of which were shot down,was on a small scale and not aggressive; four U.S. bombers are missing. the bombing was well concentrated in the target areas and both marshalling yardswere severely damaged. On the airfields at least 24 aircraft were destroyed and hangars and buildings were hit. In all a total of 932 tons of bombs was released.(See Appendix VI.)The ferry termini at San Giovanni and Reggio Di Calabria were raided byFortresses (B. 17) and Wellingtons which dropped 360&apos; tons of bombs; at theformer 17 trains were hit, all lines north and south were destroyed, and therailway centre rendered completely unserviceable.Vibo Valentia airfield, in the toe of Italy,&quot;was attacked on four occasionsby a total of over 200 medium bombers after which many wrecked aircraft were observed on the ground. Other airfields raided were Foggia (80 miles E.N.E.Naples), Bari, Monte Corvino/Rovella (36 miles .S.E. of Naples), Aquino (52 miles .E. of Naples) and Cotrone.Attacks on Shipping.42. Beaufighters attacked a convoy NW. of Corsica and another N.E. ofSardinia. One ship was left sinking, a tanker blew up and a small tanker caughtfire. An attack by Wellingtons resulted in one ship of 5,000 tons being sunk and an escort vessel set on fire.Battle Casualties and Sorties..44.   During the week ended the 20th July 158 enemy aircraft were shot down; 82 Allied aircraft are missing.   A total of 11,343 sorties were flown. ;Russia.45. The Soviet Air Force maintained a high scale of effort in the Orel-Kursk-Byelgorod areas, particularly around Orel, where the Russians went over ,to the offensive. The weather improved and ground attack and fighter aircraft operated strongly in support of land forces; the S.A.F. appears to be continuing to hold its own against the Luftwaffe. At night long-range bombers attacked the railway junctions of Orel, Karachev and Naylya and German airfields in the battle area also were attacked.It is probable that the Soviet advance north of Orel and the opening of active,ground operations on the Lower Donetz has enforced a redistribution of GA.F.units in an attempt to stem the Russian advance. Russian tactics thus seemto have led to a break-up of the concentration of all available G.A.F. forces against the Kursk salient. This must be accounted a considerable victory, sinceunder present circumstances it is only by concentration of effort that the G.A.F.can hope to obtain air superiority.Burma.46.   The enemy&apos;s communications were again the principal target for allied aircraft.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping on the Irrawaddy, in theAkyab area and off the Arakan Coast. Four river steamers and some oil bargeswere damaged and many sampans and other small river craft were sunk or damaged.In the Mandalay area, fighter bombers damaged ten locomotives and about100 railway trucks. A bridge near Lintha (170 miles NW. of Rangoon) andanother on the Sandoway-Awa road in the Arakan were both damaged.&apos; Among other targets successfully attacked were. the industrial centre atHymaingan, near Akyah, barracks at Meiktila in Central Burma and oil installations near Mandalay.Indo-China.47. Liberators (B. 24) dropped 40 tons of bombs on Haiphong harbour.Four ships of 6,000 tons were set on fire and three others were damaged. fires were started in the harbour area and in the railway yards.
Pacific Zone.Solomon Islands.48.   Allied air activity continued to be on a heavy scale in this area.On the morning of the 17th a force of more than 200 Allied aircraft attacked Japanese shipping in the Buin-Faisi area when seven ships consistingof one light cruiser or destroyer, two destroyers, one submarine chaser, onetanker and two cargo ships were sunk; a third cargo ship was damaged andbeached. The Allied aircraft were attacked by a strong force of Japanes fightersof which 49 were shot down for the loss of only five Allied aircraft.During the night 7th/ 18th a further attack was made on shipping inthe same area and one cargo ship was sunk and two destroyers and one cargo ship were damaged. On this occasion 13 enemy fighters were shot down for theloss of four Allied aircraft.On the 20th Allied aircraft attacked shipping off Kolombangara Island; onelight cruiser and two destroyers were sunk, another destroyer was probably sunk and one destroyer and one transport vessel were damaged.The Japanese air bases were again heavily bombed by Fortresses (B. 17) andLiberators (B. 24) and strong support was given to our land forces. On the20th about 130 tons of bombs were dropped on enemy positions in New Georgiawhich were being attacked by Allied troops.The Japanese air effort was again on a large scale and their losses in aircraft were very heavy.New Guinea.49. Allied aircraft again gave full support to our land forces in theNassau Bay area and made several heavy bombing attacks on enemy air bases.Several small ships were sunk or damaged off the coast.Celebes.50.   Thirteen Liberators (B. 24) bombed Macassar, starting several fires.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.51. On the night the 15th/16th bombs were dropped at Woolwich, at two points in Essex and at one point in Hertfordshire. Damage was trivial; therewas one fatal casualty at Binacre.Casualties.52. The only civilian casualty reported for the week ending 0600 on the 21stwas 1 killed.Appendices I, II, III and IY will be published periodically.APPENDIX Y.Casualties to H.M.
