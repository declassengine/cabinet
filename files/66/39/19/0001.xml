THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT7CThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited, it is issued for the personal use of...../y**..MOST SECRET. , Copy No.   33W.P. (43) 319.mh July, 1943.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.IN WP. (43) 295 I put forward as a basis for discussion proposals forthe distribution of our man-power resources up to the end of this year.I have reviewed these proposals in &quot;the light of our discussions.* I now circulate the following revised proposals for final endorsement by the WarCabinet.2. As regards industry, we must clearly shift the emphasis in favour of aircraft production. The additional numbers required must be obtained partlyat the expense of industries working for the Ministry of Supply, and partly by drawing into aircraft production the young women who would otherwise have gone into the Services.To achieve this transfer, the following measures will be necessary : (a) Intake into the Women&apos;s Services will be reduced to a minimum by :(i) stopping of volunteering save for some special posts; (ii) not making any further age-groups of women subject to conscription under theNational Service Acts for the time being; and (iii) appealing to womenalready accepted for the Services to go into aircraft factories until they are required in those Services.(&amp;) Women up to age 50 inclusive will be registered for employment.* W.M. (43) 96th Conclusions, Minute 3 and 100th Conclusions, Minute 2.[25773]
(c) M.A.P. must be relieved of their obligation to return to the RAF.mechanics who were lent to the aircraft industry. Those still in theindustry must be allowed to remain there for the time being.id) In general, men on M.A.P. work will not be called up for the services for the time being. Sea-going engineers required to man merchant ships built in the United States and assigned to this country must,however, be released.(e) Ministry of Supply cuts must be carefully planned to take place as faras possible in areas where the Ministry of Labour can ensure that thelabour released shall be absorbed in MAP. work. For this purposeM.A.P. must make available statements showing where their labourintake is required up to the end of the year.The labour to be released from Ministry of Supply work must,to the greatest practicable extent, be mobile labour.(/) The Regional Officers of the Ministry of Labour will be instructed tomake special efforts to fill M.A.P. vacancies; and for this purposeMAP. must supply to the Ministry of Labour each month, through their Regional Controllers, a list of firms with vacancies which mustbe filled during the month.I propose that the Minister of Labour be authorised to put all these measuresinto operation forthwith.3. In addition, the Minister of Production, in conjunction with theMinisters concerned, will endeavour to arrange block transfers of orders orcapacity and machine tools between the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of aircraft Production.4. By these means, and by renewed efforts to check wastage from theindustry, we may hope to expand the labour force on aircraft production by about100,-000 during the last five months of the year.In paragraph 7 (b) of W.P. (43) 295 I accepted the estimate of the Ministerof Aircraft Production that, to bring his labour force to its peak, he needed anet increase of 212,000 over the labour force at the 1st April, 1943. During thefour months up to the end of July it is estimated that the expansion will be notmore than 15,000. While, therefore, I still consider that he should have the212,000 for which he asked, as soon as it can be provided, I cannot hope that more that 115,000 will be secured between the 1st April and the 31st December, 1943.5. In W.P. (43) 295 I had assumed that the labour force working for theMinistry of Supply could be reduced by 215,000 by the end of the year. in w.P. (43) 309 the Minister of Supply says that this reduction could not be achievedwithin that period without risk of local unemployment and dislocation of programmes. He estimates that, by specific programme cuts, he can achievereductions equivalent, on the basis of calculations used in my paper, to 1^5,000.In view of the extreme difficulties of our position, I must ask him to aim atreleasing an additional 30,000.   The Ministry of Supply should make their
contribution of labour as flexible as possible. This may mean that, in addition to specific programme cuts, there should be a substantial contribution in the formof agreed minimum factory strengths over the widest possible range. TheMinistry of Labour and National Service could then draw labour from these factories to meet maturing demands. The War Office must agree to any reasonablepostponement of deliveries which this policy entails.I therefore suggest that we should aim at reducing, by the end of the year,the labour force working for the Ministry of Supply by 185,000 instead of the215,000 which I previously proposed.6. The arguments advanced on behalf of the Admiralty during our discussions have convinced me that the allocation which I previously suggested for the Royal Navy was too small. Clearly, they must have the full balance oftheir December allocation. And I think they have also made out a case for somekpart of their additional demand of 43,000. The requirements for the Fleet arerelated very closely to the completion dates of naval vessels under construction;and at this stage of the war I am not disposed to accept a risk that trained crewswill not be available to man the fighting vessels, which will become available nextyear. I therefore consider that we should concede the greater part of theadditional demand which is related to the requirements of the Fleet itself. Ipropose an allocation of 190,000 for the Navy, in place of the 160,000 which Ipreviously suggested.7. The balance of the Admiralty&apos;s additional demand is, in the main, forCombined Operations. It is contended that, if this demand is not met, there willbe a deficiency in crews for landing craft which will have the effect of reducingby one-third the total lifting capacity for operation &quot; Overlord.&quot;I accept the view that the success of this operation must turn very largely on the efficiency of the organisation responsible for putting the invading forceashore. And I attach great importance to the consideration that we shouldnot conceal from the United States Government any prospective short-fall on theprovision which we have undertaken to make for this operation. If it is the considered view of the Chiefs of Staff that, unless the additional man-powerdemands of the Admiralty are met in full, we shall be unable to meet the commitments which we have entered into with the Americans in respect of this operation, we should not fail to inform the United States Government of theposition and consider with them what modification of existing plans is required.But, if additional numbers are needed for the manning of these landing craft,it is clear that they cannot be provided by drawing any further men from the munitions industries or from other civilian activities. If additional men haveto be found, they must be provided from the numbers already allocated to the three services. I therefore propose that the Chiefs of Staff be invited to considerwhether the additional men demanded by the Admiralty for manning landing craft are in fact essential for the success of this operation and, if so, how theadditional numbers required can be obtained at the expense of the Armv or theR.A.F.
8. I propose that the arrangements set out in the Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (43) 311) for finding additional labour for theBuilding Programme for the months of August and September should be approved.9. The requirements of the Other Essential Industries and Services are tobe reduced from 102,000 to 70,000.The Lord President of the Council should distribute this cut among thevarious industries and services included within this group.10. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security undertook toconsider, and report to the War Cabinet, what further reduction he can make inCivil Defence Services. The effect of any such further reduction will be to increasethe supply of man-power and thus to&apos; reduce the deficit shown in the table inparagraph 11.11. I invite the War Cabinet to approve the following distribution of ourman-power resources for the period from the 1st April to the 31st December,1943 :-Thousands.Navy      ...      ...............      190ArmyE.A.F..........Admiralty (shipbuilding, &amp;c.)SupplvM.A.P.   .........Other essential industries and servicesSupplyDeficit145100501851157048541471As the number proposed for MA.P. is less than one-third of the amountdue on the old allocation, barely one half of their reduced demand of 212,000,and only two-thirds of my original allocation of 175,000, added emphasis is givento my statement in paragraph 9 of W.P. (43) 295, that no part of the deficit, ifdeficit there be, can be allowed to fall upon them. The Minister of Labour mustdistribute any deficit pro rata amongst the other claimants, making whateverarrangements are necessary, especially in calling up men and. women for theServices, to ensure this.12. The Minister of Labour will keep the Cabinet informed of any seriousfailure to make good these figures, and will report monthly to the Cabinet theresults achieved.W. S.
