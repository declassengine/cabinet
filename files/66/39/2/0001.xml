THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1943.SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 302.12th July, 1943/WAR CABINET.BRITISH POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Minister of State.I welcome the proposal of the Foreign Secretary (W.P. (43) 301) that weshould have a frank exchange of views with the United States Government about our policy and respective positions in the Middle East.2. I believe that the Middle East is, and will remain, of vital interest tothe British Commonwealth. It is (and always will be) traversed by our mainsea and air lines of Imperial communication; the &quot; siege &quot; of the Middle Eastbetween 1940 and 1943 has shown the strain to which we are put when thosecommunications are severed. As it has been a cardinal point of British policy for many generations to maintain a strong fleet in the Mediterranean, so it isnecessary for us to project our influence and guidance into the countries of the .Middle East &quot; land-bridge.&quot; (I use the word influence advisedly, since I do notbelieve that direct control except of a few strategic bases is either necessary orpracticable.) There are also our great Imperial oil resources in the Middle East,whose importance needs no emphasis.3. In the nature of the case, the Middle East cannot be of anything likesuch direct importance to the United States. Nevertheless the Americans arebeing brought more and more into contact with Middle East affairs by the warand by the wider interests which they are now developing. As I believe mycolleagues know, I am a firm believer in the necessity of Anglo-Americancollaboration, not only now but after the war. To make this collaboration areality, it seems to me that we need a series of working agreements with the americans, by which we should mutually recognise certain broad regions of theworld in which the interests of one or the other party predominate and for which that party would assume the major responsibility tfiot only in its own interestsbut for the sake of general world security and welfare. The Middle East, i suggest, is one such region which should be recognised as a British sphere, just as(for example), in leasing the West Indian bases, we have tacitly recognised thecorresponding region of the Caribbean as a sphere of American predominance.4. This programme of mutual support and collaboration could not be successfully maintained unless we take the Americans into our confidence in the regions for which we are responsible and keep them abreast of our policy and objectives there (we should no doubt expect them to reciprocate in regions of american predominance). Since I have been in the Middle East I have donemy best to foster good relations with the American diplomatic and other repre-sentatives in the area. But of late I find them saying to me (understandablyenough) that we do not really keep them informed of what our problems and policies are in those countries except at the eleventh hour when we need their support in some negotiation with one or other of the local Governments. Afterthe recent Middle Eastern War Council the American Minister in Cairo (whom know very well personally) asked me straight out what we had been discussing.In the circumstances I could tell him nothing more than generalities. If this state of affairs is not remedied, I believe there is a real danger of the Americanslaunching out on an independent policy of their, own in the Middle East, actuated,probably, by their oil, civil aviation and trade interests. The next step would befor the local Governments to play us and the Americans off against one another to the detriment of both in the long run. On the other hand, if we act together,our joint influence could scarcely be challenged.[25716]
5. I hope, therefore, that ray colleagues will agree to a frank approach tothe United States Government on these lines, and will authorise me, on my returnto Cairo, to follow the same principles in my contacts with American representa-tives in the Middle East.6. In any expose of our policy in the Middle East to the Americans I should like, for my part, to see considerable prominence given to the economic side. take this opportunity of inviting the attention of the War Cabinet to theresolutions of the Middle Eastern War Council on future economic policy in theMiddle East. (These have already been circulated see Section IV of w.P. (43) 247 but for convenience of reference I attach them as an annex to this paper.) Briefly, our proposal is to work by stages towards the formation of a regional Economic Council for the Middle East, as a consultative body, on whichwe and the Americans would be represented alongside the various local governments.7. In my view one of the most fruitful ways in which we can project our influence in the Middle East into the post-war period is through the medium ofeconomic affairs. There is a real need for expert guidance and material help.We (and the Americans) are best placed to provide it, and it is likely to be more acceptable than direct political tutelage. Conversely, if we do not keep theinitiative,in this field, we may well find ourselves faced after the war with serious economic and social disturbances in the Middle East which would undermine our political influence and increase our military commitments. I need not recapitu-late the whole argument here, but the following points seem1 to me particularlyrelevant in connection with enlisting American co-operation in the middle east: (a) The economic resolutions of the Middle Eastern War Council offer a constructive policy for the Middle East as a whole, providing a commonbackground and purpose to our relations with the individual territories as surveyed in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s draft. An essential part of this programme is to promote the co-operation of the Middle Easterncountries with one another and with Britain and America.(b) The Economic Council would provide a means of integrating the middle east, as a region, into whatever world commodity and monetarycontrol arrangements may be adopted at the peace settlement. Itwould give us the opportunity of guiding the economic development ofthe Middle East in accordance with the principles of the atlantic charter. Moreover, we should be in a better position to influence theexpenditure of the large sterling and other oversea balances now beingaccumulated by the Middle East countries towards useful and productive purposes.(c) We already have, in the Middle East Supply Centre, an Anglo-Americanagency capable of being developed into an instrument to carry out these policies. It has been built up for the short-term purpose of saving-shipping and making the Middle East as self-sufficient as possible.In doing so it is already well on the way to becoming an economic&quot; service station &quot; and co-ordinating centre for the Middle East.8. The resolutions of the Middle East War Council on this question haverecently been examined inter-departmentally by the Middle East (Official)Committee^ and endorsed by them as desirable. The Committee felt that there might be some difficulties in putting the whole range of proposals into execution,and recommended a gradual approach: I agree. I had, of course, always intended that we should progress towards the objective of a regional Economic Councilexperimentally and by stages. Plans for some of the preparatory stages havealready been worked out, though I need not trouble the War Cabinet with thedetails. The timing of the various stages will have to- be guided by experience,and we should not begin &apos;&apos; selling &apos;&apos; the idea of a Middle&apos; East Economic Councileither too soon or too late. What is important (as I see it) is- that we should know what our targets are, so that we can shape our day-to-day policy in the middle east in accordance with a general though flexible plan. Only thus can we ensurethat, if a more permanent regional organisation appears desirable and practicableas the war draws to a close, the opportunity of essential preparatory work willnot.have been lost.9. I understand that the Departments concerned would wish theGovernments of the Dominions and India to be informed of these economic* M.E. (O) (43) 2nd Meeting, 2nd July.
proposals. No doubt the gist .of our general approach to the Americans on middle east policy would be communicated to the Dominions and India as a matter ofcourse, and I suggest that the economic proposals, if accepted, can best be covered in the same communication. For my part I would hope that the australian government (for example) would appreciate fully the importance of the middle east to the British Commonwealth and would support any measures designed tostrengthen our position there.10. To sum up, if, as I hope, the War Cabinet approve an approach tothe United States Government, as proposed by the Foreign Secretary, designedto achieve a better understanding with the Americans on our Middle East policy on the basis of the area being recognised as a primarily British sphere, I invitemy colleagues also (1) to endorse the programme Of development by stages towards a middle east Economic Council, and approve its incorporation, as one of our objectives, in our communication to the Americans;(2) to authorise me, on my return to the Middle East- (a) to keep American representatives in that area fully in touch withthe development of our policy;(&amp;) to begin to work out in practice, in concert with the other authorities concerned, the development recommended in sub-paragraph (1);it being understood that I should refer to the War cabinet again when I considered that the stage had been reached when we might proceed: td the establishment of a Middle EastEconomic Council, but before any indication was given to theindependent Governments of the Middle East that it was proposed to do so.R. G. C.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,12th July, 1943.ANNEX. &apos;Resolutions op the Middle East War Council on Future Economic Policyin the Middle East.[Extract front M.E.W.C. (43) 2&apos;5: dated nth May, 1943*]1. The economic stability-and consequent, social and political&apos; content-ment of the Middle East is a major strategic interest of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and thus of the United Nations. To achieve this&apos; purpose fully it isnecessary to consider the Middle East as&apos; a regional unit. The foundations ofsuch a conception; have been laid oil a war-time basis by the work&quot; of the Middle&apos;East Supply Centre as an Anglo-American regional planning agency.2. As a result of world supply, transportation&apos; and monetary difficulties, andthe necessity for provisioning liberated countries ahd,other deficient areas, Anglo-American, controls over supplies and distribution will have to remain in being inthe Middle East until some considerable&apos; time after the end of the war. If theyare to operate effectively, it will be politically necessary from now onwards tomake them more acceptable to the Middle East Governments by a progressiveprocess of consultation and partnership accompanied where possible by a gradual relaxation of restrictions.3. On a longer-term basis, it will be in the interest of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and of the United Nations generally, to call into being some form of regional economic organisation for the&apos; Middle East for implementing policies in harmony with the Atlantic Charter, and in order to provide a means of advisingand guiding the Middle East administrations in handling their common war and post-war economic and monetary problems which they are incapable of solvingalone. In the absence of an organisation of this nature there is a grave risk ofeconomic collapse in the area as a whole, with its consequent effect on security.4. Our ultimate objective should be to create a Middle East economic council, as a consultative body representative of the Middle East Governments* Also circulated as W.P. (43) 247.&apos; .
and of the Governments of external Powers (principally Great Britain and theUnited States) with major interests in this region. This body would play thepart of an&quot; economic Parliament,&quot; linked with and served by an executive and planning agency which could be developed out of the existing Middle East SupplyCentre, adapted and liberalised to meet the changing circumstances. The successof any such arrangements would depend to a marked extent on the quality and quantity of British and American personnel which can be made available in theMiddle East.5. This objective should be approached by stages, and the timing of thesuccessive stages, including the launching of the Council itself (which, to be effective, should be in being before the end of the war), will require careful handling in the light of events. The two main ways of approaching the objective,and at the same time of serving the short-term purpose described in paragraph 2,will be: (a) to take immediate steps to bring the local Governments both collectivelyand individually into consultation by means of conferences on subjects of interest to them such as transport, food production, rationing,statistics, &amp;c.(b) to build up gradually a regional economic secretariat which would at the outset be linked to the Middle East Supply Centre, would providestatistics, documentation and the like of common interest to theMiddle East, and some at least of the personnel of which would bedrawn from the territories concerned. This secretariat might^eventually become the office of the agency described in paragraph 4.6. The Middle East Governments are unlikely to respond unless they seethat they are likely to obtain more practical advantages from planned andco-ordinated action than from a progressive reversion to economic nationalism.The main jneans of convincing them of this are : (a) by relaxing (as we shall soon be in a position to do) some of the purelyrestrictive functions of* the Middle East Supply Centre, andorganising, through the Centre, the procurement of supplies forwar-time consumption;(&amp;) by providing and interchanging expert advice, experience and informa-tion, directed increasingly towards reconstruction problems;(c) by facilitating after the war the co-ordinated procurement of supplies,particularly for development projects.7. The realisation of these objectives calls for an early initiative on thepart of His Miajesty&apos;s Government, preferably in association with the UnitedStates Government, if the present opportunity is not to be lost. This opportunityis provided by the widespread but, as yet, incoherent desire for closer association between most of the Middle East States, which it is generally agreed can best be approached on economic lines. It is desirable in any event for this movement tobe guided into healthy and fruitful channels, in order to prevent it degenerating,as it may otherwise easily do, into a form of acute nationalism hostile to our influence. Provided the political problems of Palestine and Syria are resolved insuch a way as to make co-operation between the Middle East countries andHis Majesty&apos;s Government possible, these proposals offer one of the most hopefulmeans of keeping the general initiative in the Middi3 East in our hands.
