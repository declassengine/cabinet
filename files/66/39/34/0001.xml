THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 334.23rd July, 1943.WAR CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.1. ON the 22nd April (W.M. (43) 58th Conclusions, Minute 1) the WarCabinet approved telegrams inviting the Governments of the Dominions andIndia to send officials to discuss, with officials of the United Kingdom Govern-ment, our proposed approach to tbe United States on Post-War commercial policy. These discussions started in London on the 15th June and were success-fully completed on the 30th June. The upshot in the terms of a Summary agreed with the Dominion and Indian representatives was that: Speaking generally, the Dominion and Indian delegations, while in no way committing their Governments, saw advantages in the United Kingdomtaking the initiative in informal and exploratory discussions with the UnitedStates on commercial policy, as part of action to promote the positive aims ofArticle 7 of the Mutual Aid Agreement. The delegations noted that this initiative would follow broadly the lines of the Aide-memoire. It was under-stood that the United Kingdom representatives would be speaking at thisstage purely for themselves, though with the background of the provisionalviews expressed by the various delegations at the present discussions, andthat it would be open to other members of the Commonwealth to express their own views at the proper time.&quot;There was general support for the multilateral approach, which the Canadiandelegation advocated with special emphasis.2. A report of these talks was considered by a Committee of Ministers underthe Chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 23rd July (Gen. 5 /4thMeeting). It was agreed that we should now be justified in opening up discussions with United States representatives, to whom our representatives should be autho-rised to&quot; present the attached Aide-memoire (Annex A). It was further agreedthat the attached Outline of Proposals (Annex B) should be used as a brief by our representatives, who might, at an appropriate stage of the discussions, hand it tothe United States representatives as an informal document, illustrating one way in which the principles embodied in the Aide-memoire might take shape.3. The Committee felt that there were strong reasons why this initiativeshould be taken forthwith, but they recognised that there were great advantages in treating commercial policy as part of a more general approach to the UnitedStates on all the subjects covered by Article 7 of the Mutual Aid Agreement, asproposed in W.P. (43) 329.4. If the War Cabinet approve the proposals made in W.P. (43) 329, thediscussions with the United States on commercial policy will take their place inthe general approach to be made by the United Kingdom delegation at Washingtonearly in September.5. I, therefore, recommend that the Aide-memoire and the Outline of Pro-posals should now be approved by the War Cabinet for use as suggested inparagraph 2 above.H. D.Board of Trade, S.

ANNEX A.Aide-memoire.As has been stated on many occasions, His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom favours a commercial policy designed to promote general economic expansion and action directed towards the removal of the obstacles to international trade, and is especially desirous to co-operate with the Governmentof the United States in joint endeavours to promote these aims. While, duringthe transitional period immediately after the war when we are seeking to restoreour balance of trade, we may have to retain some special measures of control, we hope that we and other countries will be able to emerge from this stage without undue delay. It is with this in mind, and as a contribution to the conversationsto which we are committed under Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement, thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom submits for considerationcertain points which form a practical approach to this problem, and which might prove suitable for discussion among the United Nations. It will be seen that theground covered is somewhat wider than that which would be relevant to thediscussion of a normal bilateral trade agreement. This is not because His-Majesty&apos;s Government is unmindful of the importance of the method of bilateraltrade agreements or of the extent to which this method has already contributed to the clearance of the channels of trade, but rather because it is felt that thereare certain problems which are less susceptible to treatment in this manner, whichnevertheless deserves consideration in the comprehensive view which Article VIIinvites us to take. The following are the points which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom wish to present : *(i) An international commercial policy capable of helping towards thesolution of the post-war economic and political problems would haveto be accompanied by international policies conducive to a high level of employment, production and consumption; to improvedstandards of living; and, in general, to an expansive world economy.It requires some system for the free convertibility of currencies fortrading purposes. Further, an essential condition of success is thedevelopment of effective political and strategic plans for the achieve-ment of. security.(ii) The policy should also be based on the assumption of a multilateralcommercial agreement, embracing as many countries as possible. as great Britain is compelled to rely on imports for a large proportionof her food and raw materials, it is essential that she should be enabled to pay for these imports by means of exports. Bilateral agreementsby themselves, -however advantageous, cannot in our view fully meetthe needs either of our own or of the general situation, whereas a multilateral agreement, laying down certain principles for the freerexchange of commodities, can be of great benefit; the multilateralconvention would not, of course, exclude supplementary bilateral agreements within the framework of the multilateral agreement.(iii) The United Kingdom, both by tradition and by experience, regards anincreased freedom of trade as being in the interest of the general world economy. We shall join in any movement to secure it and, when it comes down to practice, we should have every motive to encourage it,both from our own point of view and on account of the general inter-national benefit. Our sympathy is entirely with,those who are seeking to remove barriers to trade. Any qualifications we may have to makewill be due to the special difficulties of the immediate post-war period and the present uncertainty as to what will, in fact, lie within our power and that of other countries.(iv) We would accept an upper limit of moderate height for tariffs for incorporation in a multilateral agreement. The question should beconsidered whether special provisions could be devised to meet, on areasonable scale, the temporary needs of infant industries.(v) We should be prepared to make all our arrangements, includingparticularly quantitative restriction of imports, on a basis of mutualnon-discrimination.   Preferences are dealt with below in (vi).(vi) Quite apart from our own position, a general plan should leave room forspecial arrangements within political and geographical groups, since these are likely to be asked for and could be properly conceded in manycases.   As part of a comprehensive scheme for the betterment of the
ANNEX B.Illustrative Outline of Proposals.THE following outline is put forward as an illustration of one way in which,the principles in the aide-memoire might be applied in a general multilateralcommercial convention : A. Tariffs.(i) There should be established for all ad valorem duties a maximum&apos;&apos; ceiling&quot; of X per cent, with a corresponding limit for specificduties.(ii) Duties below this ceiling should be reduced by Y per cent, of their level as at the outbreak of war in September 1939, with the proviso thatno duty need be reduced below 10 per cent, ad valorem.(iii) These proposals should relate only to the protective element in dutiesy(i.e., they would not limit revenue duties).(iv) The proposals would be subject to any exceptions that might be approvedby the Commercial Union (see G (i) below), in consultation as regardspolitical aspects with any other appropriate international body, forthe protection of industries necessary on grounds of security,(v) The question might be considered whether special provisions could be devised to meet, on a reasonable scale, the temporary needs of infantindustries.B. Preferences.(i) Existing preferential margins (whether under Imperial Preference inthe United Kingdom and other Empire countries or in foreign Empiresor in regional arrangements , between foreign countries) should bereduced by Z per cent, of their level as at the outbreak of war, withthe proviso that no preferential margin need be reduced below 5 percent, ad valorem. .(ii) No new preferences should be permitted in existing preferential areas;and no new preferences or Customs Unions should be established inany other areas, without the approval of, the Commercial Union, inconsultation as regards political aspects with any other appropriate international body.C. Subsidies. - . . ,. (i) State action (by direct or indirect subsidies or by means of state trading) which results in the sale of goods in foreign markets at prices lower than those corresponding to the prices charged in thehome market should be forbidden.[25804]&apos; W^&amp; &apos;: ill   B 2trade of the world as a whole, we should be prepared to play our full part in any general scheme for reducing preferences,(yii) We consider that the quantitative regulation of imports should notordinarily be employed for the primary purpose of protecting homeindustries, but rather regarded as a mechanism appropriate and useful for special purposes, including, among others, the safeguarding of a country&apos;s balance of payments. We suggest that common agreement might be reached concerning a more or less automatic and objectivetest of the conditions under which such action should be permissible;for example, it might be found that the statistics resulting from thecreation of an international monetary authority could be used forthis purpose.(viii) We should be prepared to agree to measures designed to prevent export subsidies.(ix) Any multilateral commercial arrangement should be compatible with theconduct of external trade by the State, or by State-sponsored organisa-tions, as well as by private enterprise. But it would be desirablethat forms of trading promoted by State action should be conducted inaccordance with a code to be agreed.(x) We believe that these points could best be covered by the formulation ofof a general commercial code to which all countries would be invitedto subscribe. ,
(ii) Apart from this, there appears to be a case for leaving States free toprotect home production by means of direct and open State subsidies.However, every effort should be made to ensure that such subsidies are confined within moderate limits.D. Quantitative Import Restrictions.(i) Immediately after the war there should be, an initial period of, say,two years, during which it will be permissible for any Government tocontrol its imports by quantitative restrictions. During these twoyears, however, any country making use of such restrictions would be committed to consult with any country which considered that itsinterests were injured thereby, with a view to ensuring that therestrictions were operated in an equitable and non-discriminatorymanner and so as to cause as little harm as possible to the supplying countries. If agreement could not be reached in such consultations,the Commercial Union would use its offices with a view to conciliation.In appropriate cases there should be consultation, both during the initial period and subsequently, between the Commercial Union andthe International Labour Organisation, which is particularly wellqualified to deal with international labour standards,(ii) Governments should undertake, on joining the Commercial Union, thatat the end of this two-year period they would remove their import restrictions by progressive steps over a period of, say, three years,&quot;except in the case of the categories mentioned below or other-categories approved by the Commercial Union. The approvedcategories would cover, in addition to the usual exceptions on grounds of health, &amp;c, action under the following heads : &apos;(a) In respect of recognised international commodity agreements andother special agreements affecting the production of and/or trade in particular commodities which may be reached between two or more Governments and approved by the commercial union;(b) On the ground of balance of payments difficulties.   It might bepossible to devise a more or less automatic and objective test of the conditions under which action on these grounds shouldbe permissible; and(c) Subject to the approval of the Commercial Union, in consultation as regards political aspects with any other appropriate inter-national body, for the protection of industries necessary on grounds of security.Non-discrimination as between members of the Commercial Union, shouldbe- the aim in all action permitted under these categories.(iii) Exchange restrictions on current payments (as distinct from capital movements) should not be applied in a manner inconsistent with theabove-mentioned objectives.E. Export Taxes and Restrictions.Such devices should be subject to rules generally similar to those proposed for import taxes and restrictions.F. State Trading.(i) The multilateral commercial convention should be compatible with theconduct of external trade by the State or State-sponsored organisa-tions, as well as by private enterprise.(ii) The discriminatory misuse of State trading should be prevented byrules based generally on Article 8 of the United States-UnitedKingdom Trade Agreement of 1938. These might provide that state trading monopolies should be guided solely by economic considerations.(iii) State trading organisations should be permitted to make contracts forlonger periods than normal commercial considerations would dictate.Where buffer stock schemes exist, such contracts should be made only within the range of the buffer stock prices. For other commoditiesthe long-term contracts should, wherever possible, be thrown open toa form of international tender.   The limitation on protection set by
the tariff ceiling should provide a criterion for judging whether suchpurchases were excessively protective. The latter provision isintended to refer primarily to State purchases for resale. Any suchlimitation would be difficult to impose in the case of State purchasesfor the Governments own use.(iv) Where a State trades through a monopoly, countries with which it dealsshould be allowed to canalise their transactions with it through a monopoly of their own, such action not being regarded asdiscriminatory. -G. The Commercial Union.(i) The suggested code of rules regarding commercial policy should be embodied in a multilateral convention, which would establish aCommercial Union of the adherent States. This multilateral conven-tion would not exclude supplementary bilateral agreements within the framework of the multilateral agreement.(ii) The member States should (with such exceptions as are involved inB above) be required to give most-favoured-nation treatment to eachother. They should be permitted to refuse most-fayoured-nation treatment to non-member States.(iii) To prevent the formation of rival economic blocs, every endeavour shouldbe made to secure the adherence of all the United Nations and of leading neutral countries to the Convention.(iv) Subject to the general reservation that it will have to be decided inother connections what commercial terms are to be imposed onex-enemy States, such States should be required to adhere to the Union(probably on terms) in order to prevent them from developing againan autarkic economy and exercising improper economic pressure ontheir neighbours.(v) The Commercial Union cannot work satisfactorily without the existence *of an international monetary body. At the same time, the observance of the rules of the Commercial Union should greatly facilitate theworking of any such monetary organisation. For this reason it is amatter for consideration whether membership of the two bodies shouldbe common. States which find one or the other the more attractive tothem might thus be induced to become members of both. The grounds for requiring any member of the Commercial Union to adhere also tothe monetary organisation appear particularly strong.H. International Institutions.(i) The Commercial Union would need the institution of a Council or Con-ference of its members to supervise its operation and to develop itsobjectives. This body should possess the ultimate power of expellingfrom the Union any member State which persistently disregarded therules of the Union.(ii) The above proposals also require the institution of a fact-finding body with quasi-judicial functions. For this purpose there might be instituted an International Commerce Commission, to which anymember State could appeal when it was aggrieved by any action of another member State in contravention of the rules of the Union. Anaggrieved State should be free to take immediate countervailing com-mercial action against the offending member, but should be obliged totake the case for decision by the International Commerce Commissionand to accept the decision of that body.
