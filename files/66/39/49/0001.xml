jTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 349.31st July, 1943.INDIANS REQUIREMENTS OF IMPORTED FOOD GRAINS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE Indian economy is being strained almost to breaking point by the enormous demands laid upon it in its dual role as a source of supplies and of men for the Army, and a base for military operations. The large sums of money whichhave had to be poured into the country, against which there has been no offsettingvolume of imports, have created a serious inflationary situation, one of themanifestations of which is a tendency tO* hold commodities on the part of themillions of producers scattered all over the vast countryside. India is essentially primitive country with only a veneer of developed finance and industry, andthe administrative system, although adequate for normal requirements, is a mereskeleton. Controls of the kind which are appropriate and feasible in western countries cannot be wholly successfully reproduced there. Nevertheless, theGovernment of India, who are now fully alive to the dangers of the position, aretackling the problem energetically. They have already put into effect financialand fiscal measures, to some of which reference&apos;is made in paragraph 3 of theShipping Committee&apos;s Report, and further. measures are urgently underconsideration.2. Meanwhile, with reference particularly to the food position, other factorscomplicate the issue. There is a general sense of insecurity abroad, enhanced bymemories of the civil disturbances of last year and, in the north-eastern areas inparticular, by the near presence of Japanese forces. The -cultivator also findsthat, owing to the good prices which he can get for such produce as he markets,coupled with the extreme shortage of goods (particularly cotton piece-goods) uponwdiich to spend his cash, there is no strong inducement to part with a considerableportion of his cereals, and he either stores them or, probably to a quite considerable extent, consumes them. Meanwhile, in order to tackle the problem of drawingout these surpluses, it is inevitable that the provincial Government machine shouldbe employed, and here a conflict of loyalties has in the past been apparent, sincethe immediate interest of these Governments and of their local officers is to look after the well-being of their own people and to avoid taking measures which might prejudice law and order. To make matters worse, there has been evidence of a campaign conducted by elements hostile to the Government, designed to persuade the cultivator not to part with his produce. The Government of India are confident that under the arrangements to which they have now come with theprovinces, these difficulties will be very considerably reduced.3. It remains the case, however, that in the immediate future, before allthe measures referred to &quot;above become effective, a very critical situation willprevail, and, in my view, it is essential to tide over this period by giving theGovernment of India the assistance which they have requested, by way of suppliesof food grains definitely assured to them and publicly announced. I regard this as essential in order that the retention of undue stocks may be discouraged;that the price and supply control which the Government of India hope toestablish may be facilitated; that the sense of security of those who are nowapprehensive about the position may, in so far as it has been undermined byapprehensions of food shortage, be restored; and in particular that the wide-spread rumours as to the effects of the large requirements of the growing armed forces in India may be countered.[25854]Copy no war CABINET.
4.   Unless the requirements of the Government of India are substantiallymet, I apprehend that there is grave danger of the following consequences in&apos; the coming months :  (a) A marked reduction in the production of munitions and supplies inIndia is inevitable, with consequent detriment to the maintenanceof the forces in, and drawing their supplies from, India. Moreover,the internal transportation system of India is already in a criticalstate owing to inadequate supplies of rolling stock and further deterioration will follow if the railway personnel go short of food.It is of vital importance that railway, port and inland water transport operatives shall be maintained in good heart and goodhealth since the military situation in India is entirely dependent onthe communications system.(b) It is certain that India would find it necessary to refuse all exports- offood-stuffs (thus creating difficulty in regard to Ceylon and the persian gulf) and might even be driven to cut off supplies of piece-goods whichare so essential for the Colonies and other countries to which suchexports are now sent.(c) Famine conditions, which have indeed already begun to appear, maywell spread to such considerable areas that we shall be driven before long to lay on shipping urgently and inconveniently, in order toprevent sheer starvation.   1(d) Civil disturbances must be expected to break out and it might well benecessary to divert troops to deal with the situation, thus preventingtheir discharging their proper functions against the Japanese.(e) Subversive activities among the troops in the Indian Army, which arealready causing anxiety, are most likely to be successful ifaccompanied by reports from home that their families are starving.5. In the light of the foregoing, I feel bound to advise my colleagues thatthere is, in my judgment, a most serious risk that, if we do not assist the Govern-ment of India in the way they have requested, plans for future operations basedon the Indian theatre will be jeopardised, and the whole concept of India, notonly as a source of supplies but also as a base for operations, may have to bere considered.L. -S.
