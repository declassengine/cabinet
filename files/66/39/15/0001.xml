THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   Jidy 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 315.\Uh July, 1943.WAR CABINET.DEMOBILISATION FROM THE SERVICES AND demobilisation and RESETTLEMENT OF LABOUR.Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio.WE must, I think, carefully consider the appropriate machinery, determine what committees shall be set up, and what their respective functions are to be.As I see it, the questions involved fall under two main heads : (A) The preparation of a scheme to secure that men are taken out ofthe Services in an equitable manner. This raises, for instance, the question as to whether or not special weight shall be attached to service abroad.(B) The problem of placing men, when discharged from the Services, ormen who are no longer required in munition industries. &amp;c, back intoordinary peace-time work.A.^Demobilisation from the Services.2. The Committee which has dealt with (A) has been the Committee onthe Machinery of Demobilisation presided over in the first instance by Sir GeorgeChrystal and latterly by Sir Alfred Hurst and composed of representatives ofthe Service Departments and the Ministry of Labour and National Service. Ithas presented two reports^ outlining a scheme of demobilisation according to a combination of age and length of service. (Provision is. however, contemplatedfor the early release of special priority individuals or groups within limits notendangering the main scheme.) The War Cabinet acceptedt these reports ingeneral.3. Recently it has become necessary to consider a revision of this scheme,particularly with regard to the weight, if any, to be attached to service overseasas opposed to service at home. The Secretary of State for War in W.P. (43) 239,paragraph 12, suggests that the Committee presided over by Sir George Chrystal,and later by Sit Alfred Hurst, should be reconstituted in a slightly modified formfor this and cognate purposes. I expressed my concurrence in this proposal in w.P. (43) 241, paragraph 2, The Secretary of State for Air in W.P. (43) 252,paragraph 9, does-not, I think, dissent from this proposal.4. There is another matter which has to be undertaken arising from a remitby the Lord Presidents Committee of the 25th June, 19434 at which I was invited to consider what modifications of the National Service Acts would berequired between the cessation of hostilities and the signature of the peace. Ithink the Lord Presidents Committee intended that this task should be under-taken by Committee (A). The Service Departments were not present at the lord presidents Committee, and I have not ascertained their views. I myself thinkthat the personnel of Committee (A) may require to be modified to deal with this further problem. Important labour questions would be involved, and the Boardof Trade, and possibly the Production Departments, would also be concerned, butthe primary consideration would seem to be the nature of the military require-ments, at any rate as regards any military occupation of European countries, andpossibly also as regards continuing hostilities in the Far East.* W.P.

B. Demobilisation and Resettlement of Labour.5. The Second Interim Report* of the Committee on Post-war internal economic Problems, under the heading of Resettlement, recommended (para-graph 23) the setting up of a Committee to decide the criteria to be adopted in granting prior release where this is essential to a rapid revival of peace-time production. This recommendation was also accepted! by the War Cabinet. TheMinister of Labour in W.P. (43) 284, paragraph 5, suggests that this Committeeshould now be set up, but that it should cover &quot; demobilisation, civil and military,as a whole, including demobilisation priorities.&quot;6. I think myself it would lead to confusion if this Committee were to concern itself with the basic scheme which is one of broad policy for gettingmen out of the Services. I therefore suggest that the &quot; Machinery of Demobilisa-tion Committee,&quot; i.e., the Committee referred to in paragraph 3 above, should at once proceed with the consideration of any necessary modifications of theoriginal proposals they presented, and that when these proposals have beenapproved the scheme so prepared should be handed over to Committee (B) in orderthat they may start their preliminary work. Incidentally, Committee (B) would need to have represented on it Departments such as the Production Departments,the Board of Trade and Department of Overseas Trade which are not concernedwith Committee (A).Committee Proposed by Secretary of State for India.7. The Secretary of State for India in W.P. (43) 232, paragraph 7, suggeststhat a Committee of the War Cabinet, under a Ministerial chairman, should beset up for the purpose of considering the need for cultivating the state of moralenecessary to ensure the completion of our military operations after the defeat ofthe Axis in Europe and the best means of achieving the required results. If itis decided to set up a Committee for this purpose, it would probably be constitutedon lines-different from either A or B and should not cover the same class of work.W. A.
