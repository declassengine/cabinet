POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION-SECOND QUARTERLY SURVEY(1st APRIL-30th JUNE, 1943).A. External Affairs.1. The Clearing Union Scheme.INFORMAL and limited talks between United States Treasury experts and various United Nations experts continued&apos;in Washington since the date of thelast Quarterly Survey until the 15th June, when there was a meeting includingexperts of some seventeen countries. The meeting discussed informally, on thebasis of the American plan, the Clearing Union and a Canadian revision of theAmerican plan. A revised version of the American plan was produced at short notice with many changes, mostly in the direction of assimilation to the ClearingUnion, except on the question of capital subscription. The discussions willcontinue and there may be a larger conference of experts in Washington sometime in September.2. The International Regulation of Primary Products.The draft of a scheme for the regulation of the price of primary products,which has been approved in principle for discussion with United States officials,has not yet been communicated to them, but opportunity was taken at the food conference at Hot Springs to indicate the general lines of approach.3. International Pood Conference.A Report (W.P. (43) 275) on the International Food Conference at HotSprings was brought by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs before the WarCabinet, who approved the proposal to announce His Majesty&apos;s governments acceptance of the resolutions passed at the Conference and the obligation to giveeffect to them in so far as they apply to conditions in the United Kingdom.*4. Commercial Policy.A joint memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Trade (W.P. (43) 136) was considered by a Committeeof Ministers and by the War Cabinet during April, t It was decided to telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington the text of a draft Aide-Memoire,based on paragraph 7 of the joint memorandum, which he could, when the propertime came, hand to the United States Secretary of State as a provisional indica-tion of the views of the United Kingdom Government and as affording a basis for exploratory discussions with the United States Government. His Majesty&apos;ambassador was also instructed as to the oral explanations he should give whensubmitting the Aide-Memoire to Mr. Cordell Hull.It was considered desirable, however, first to obtain a provisional indication of the views of the Governments of the Dominions and the Government of India.Accordingly, those Governments were invited to send representatives to london for a non-committal exchange of views, on the expert level, similar to that which took place in the autumn of 1942 on the Clearing Union and Buffer Stocks plans.&apos; The Governments of the Dominions and of India accepted this suggestion,and the informal conference with their representatives was held, under the jointauspices of the Board of Trade and the Dominions Office, on the 15th to 30thJune. The results of the discussions are being reported in the first instance tothe Ministers immediately concerned.5. Civil Aviation.The Report of the Official Committee referred to in the last survey was received and considered by Ministers in conjunction with representatives ofthe Dominions and India. It was decided that the Dominion and indian governments should be asked to state whether, in their opinion, an approach shouldbe made forthwith to the Governments of the United States and the U.S.S.R. onthe question of the full internationalisation of post-war civil aviation. The replies,while generally favouring international discussion of this problem, were opposedto the presentation, in particular to the United States, of a proposal for full inter-nationalisation. The replies also made it clear that the Dominions themselves would desire to reserve their internal services.* W.M. (43) 91st Conclusions, Minute 1.f W.M. (43) 58th Conclusions, Minute 1.
Ministers then decided that progress could best be achieved by suggestingdiscussions on the official level in London and, in view of the Dominion objectionsto full internationalisation, by a reconsideration of the United Kingdomobjectives.. At a subsequent discussion with Dominion and Indian representatives, a canadian proposal for a conference with the United States at Ottawa wasconsidered, and it was agreed that the United Kingdom. representatives should prepare a brief statement of general principles for communication to the Govern-ments of the Commonwealth for their agreement and support at any Conference.This statement of general principles (W.P. (43) 251) was put before the WarCabinet by the Minister without Portfolio and was considered together withmemoranda by the Prime Minister and other Ministers on the 24th June, 1943.The proposals in the statement were approved, with certain modifications. TheWar Cabinet also agreed to the Dominion and Indian Governments being informedthat we were willing to agree&apos;to a Conference, attended by representatives of theCommonwealth, the United States, and the U.S.S.R., and preceded by Common-wealth discussions. The War Cabinet also invited the Lord Privy Seal to assume responsibility for the Conference and the preliminary discussions so far as theUnited Kingdom Government was concerned, as well as for the co-ordination ofGovernment policy.*6. International Relief and Rehabilitation.The Hon. Herbert Lehman, Director of the United States Office of ForeignRelief and Rehabilitation Operations, visited this country in April and, in aseries of discussions with Departments, informed himself upon British policy towards relief and rehabilitation problems. He also met the Allied Governments,and at a meeting of the Inter-Allied Committee outlined the work of his Officeand present United States policy on this question.The - United States Government has now formally transmitted a draft agreement on a United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to theUnited Nations and has asked for early comments with a view to convening aconference in Washington during the summer.The Inter-Allied Committee is considering its first Report on Post-war requirements, and it is hoped that this will be completed and presented to theAllied Governments shortly. It gives a general survey of the Committee&apos;s work,sets out the minimum imports programme which has been prepared for the first six months&apos; period after liberation for the eight Allied countries concerned,transmits the detailed reports made by Committees on Agriculture, MedicalSupplies and Services, Nutrition and Inland Transport, and concludes bysubmitting a number of questions to the Governments for decision.7. Military Section of the Reconstruction Secretariat.The Military Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Problems Committee hascontinued the elaboration of Armistices or Surrender Instruments.The documents for use in the event of a collapse of Italy while the war withGermany continues, after consideration in conjunction with the Foreign Office,the Service Departments and other Departments concerned, have been forwardedby the Chiefs of Staff to the Combined Chiefs of Staff at Washington, for agree-ment prior to submission to the Governments concerned, and to general eisenhower at Algiers for information.Consideration has been given to the organisation of the Control Commissionsrequired for the execution of the Surrender Instruments or Armistices inGermany and Italy, and the fitting of these organisations into the framework of the United Nations Commission for Europe proposed in W.P. (43) 217.Estimates of the numbers required on the military side of some of the Sub-Commissions for executing the disarmament clauses have been prepared andforwarded to the Departments concerned.Preliminary proposals for the occupation of Germany and Italy, the formertotally and the latter partially, have been prepared, together with an estimate ofthe forces.that might be required.The Sub-Committee has met the Service representatives of the Dominions,India and the Colonial Office and has communicated to them details of its workup to the present.
The Sub-Committee is also collaborating with other Departments on thefollowing post-war problems :  (a) Control of Press and Propaganda, &amp;c., in enemy countries.\b) Post-war strategic requirements in the Middle East and the Mediter-ranean, on the basis of papers drafted by the Military Sub-Committee.(c) General questions of post-war security, and the consideration of variousregions in that connection, viz. Atlantic Security. ,Baltic Security.Western Europe.Polish-German Frontier.(d) Areas likely to be disturbed and disputed, particularly in East andSouth-East Europe.(e) The future of Tripolitania and Eritrea.8. Information for the Dominions and India.Questions arising out of external affairs normally form the subject of officialconsultation with the Dominion and Indian Governments when they have reached a suitable stage. As regards home affairs it has, in accordance with the decisionof the War Cabinet on the 19th November, 1942,* been arranged that, when a paper is submitted to the Reconstruction Problems Committee, consideration is givento the possibility of it being of interest to the Dominion and Indian Governments.Under this procedure a number of papers have already been communicatedconfidentially to those Governments.B. Machinery of Government.9. Central.Apart from the Committee on the Training of Civil Servants referred toin the last Survey,&apos; more general questions of Civil Service reorganisation are under active consideration by the Treasury in consultation with Heads of departments and others.The report of the Committee on conditions of service of Governmentscientific staff has been received and is being considered by the Treasury and theDepartments concerned. The conditions of service of legal and other specialiststaff are also being examined.10. Local.A paper is about to be submitted to the Reconstruction Problems Committeearising out of discussion by that Committee of a proposal to set up a RoyalCommission on Local Government now. While the balance of consideration is,it is suggested, against that course, attention will be drawn to the need for establishing improved machinery for the alteration of local government areas,which should be operative before the next &quot; county review &quot; already due takes place, and for alterations in the system of valuation for rating purposes.C. Finance.11.&apos; National Income, Post-War Capital Expenditure and Post-War national savings Campaign.The Treasury, in consultation with the Economic Section of the War cabinet and with the help of the Central Statistical Office, have prepared a paperindicating the influences affecting the level of the national income and giving a provisional estimate of the possible national income for 1948 to 1952.A paper is in course, of preparation on the capital expenditure that it isexpected will be required in the years after the war to make up arrears and. toprovide for development.The Chancellor of the Exchequer is about to appoint a small Inter-Departmental Committee under Lord Kindersley&apos;s chairmanship to consider theform of the National Savings Campaign after the war.D.-Industry.12. Industrial Reconstruction.(a) Approach to Industries.The Board of Trade and the other interested Departments are proceeding with their approach to industries on reconstruction problems.   The Ministry of
Supply, in conjunction with the Board of Trade, is taking the primary responsibility for approaching the raw material controlled industries with theexception of textiles, the approach to which is in the hands of the Board ofTrade in consultation with the Ministry of Supply. Retail trade associationsare also being brought into consultation with the Board of Trade.A large number of industries has now been approached and replies are coming in, though slowly. In most, if not all, cases it will be necessary to see representa-tives of the industries in order to discuss their reply, and in some cases referencemay have to be made to Ministers on difficult points before further progress can bemade.The Board of Trade are examining, in consultation with the appropriated departments, various special problems which will affect industrial reconstruction,such as finance for industry, taxation as it affects the development of industry,deconcentration, and price control and the continuation of utility production.(b) Production Departments Sub-Committee of the Official Committeeon Post-War Internal Economic Problems.This Sub-Committee, comprising the Board of Trade, the Supply Depart-ments, the Treasury, the Ministries of Labour and Works, with representativesof the Reconstruction Secretariat and the Economic Section of the War cabinet offices as observers, is now preparing an interim report on the disposal of surplusstocks and the post-war use and disposal of Government factories and plant. Itis then going on to consider the problem of the termination of war contracts.(c) Location of Industry.Areas which are likely after the war to suffer from serious chronic depression,in default of special measures, are being surveyed by the Board of Trade withthe object of determining for each of them the nature and magnitude of the&apos;probable unemployment and the appropriate remedies. The question of theinducements which may be offered to firms to establish themselves in the formerdepressed areas after the war is also being examined. In this connection, papershave been presented to the Official Committee on Post-War Internal economic problems by the Board of Trade on Building Priorities and on Bulk Purchase,both as affecting the location of industry.(d) Export Trade.Since the last Survey, a Report on the Recovery of Export Markets and the promotion of Export Trade has been submitted by the Chairman of the Post-WarExport Trade Committee (Mr. Harcourt Johnstone) to the President of the Boardof Trade. Under cover of a note by the President, this Report (R.P. (43) 25) hasbeen circulated to the Reconstruction Problems Committee for their consideration.Appendix III of the Report lists certain subjects for further examination by thePost-War Export Trade Committee, and this examination is now proceeding in collaboration with the Departments concerned.13. A griculture.The War Cabinet has considered* the Memorandum by the two agricultural departments (W.P. (43) 103) and has decided that the examination of theproblems involved in the formulation of a long-term policy for agriculture cannotbe carried at this stage to a point at which the Agricultural Ministers could use-fully embark on discussions with the industry. The Memorandum is being-examined with a view to the submission of revised proposals.The Report on agricultural education by Mr. Justice Luxmoore&apos;s Committeeis still under consideration.14. Forestry.As stated in the last Survey, the Report of the Forestry Commission on Post-War Forestry Policy (Cmd. 6447) was remitted to the Official Committee on Post-War Internal Economic Problems. The Report submitted two programmes, one for planting 1,100,000 acres of forest land in the first decade and 1,500,000 acres in the second decade after the war (the programme preferred by the Commission),and the other for planting 875,000 acres in the first decade after the war, theplantings in the second decade being left undetermined. The larger programme was estimated to cost a sum of  41 - 2 million in the first decade and the smaller asum of  32 million, estimates being based, as far as possible, on actual unit costs,mainly pre-war, with allowances where necessary for increased cost of wages and materials. Proposals were also made for the control of private woodlands, with financial assistance to their owners, and whilst the view was expressed that it was
not necessary to alter the constitution of the Forestry Commission as the estab-lished Forest Authority, it was suggested that, if Parliament required directMinisterial responsibility, that duty could best be performed by the lord president of the Council assisted by a Committee.The Official Committee on Post-War Internal Economic Problems (whoseterms of reference did not cover that part of the proposals which related to parliamentary responsibility, this matter having been referred to the Machineryof Government Committee,) reported in favour of allowing the Forestry Commis-sion to proceed during the first decade with, the larger programme, subject to financial considerations.The Reconstruction Problems Committee at its meeting on the 19th May,1943 (R.P. (43), 6th Conclusions), decided, to authorise the publication of the forestry Commission^ Report, but to take no decision at the moment on thequestions of policy involved pending the expected debate in the House ofCommons.E. Labour.15. Demobilisation and Resettlement.(a) Post-War Training and Entry into the Building Industry.The. Building Industry Advisory Panel, proposed in paragraph 9 of theWhite Paper (Cmd. 6428), has now been constituted and has held its first meeting.The Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Labour and National service are giving special attention to the estimated labour requirements for the first two years of the Building Programme, and a memorandum on this subject isbeing submitted to the Committee on Reconstruction Priorities in order to obtainnecessary decisions on policy.The Building Apprenticeship and Training Council has held its firstmeeting and has referred to its General Purposes Committee, for review andreport, the special war and post-war problems affecting the recruitment andtraining of craft and student apprentices and the provision of teachers andinstructors.(b) Rehabilitation and Resettlement of Disabled Persons.The legislative provisions which will be required to give effect to therecommendations made by the Tomlinson Committee have been set out in amemorandum which has been sent to the British Employers&apos; Confederation andthe Trades Union Congress General Council for their consideration. These twobodies have set up small Committees to examine the report and the legislative proposals, and it is expected that in the near future they will approach theMinistry of Labour and National Service for a discussion on the wholequestion.In accordance with the recommendation made by the Committee in para. 115of their Report (Cmd. 6415), an Inter-Departmental Committee was set up inJanuary under the chairmanship of a Deputy Secretary of the Ministry ofLabour and National Service to co-ordinate the action of the various departments in giving effect to the recommendations. An interim report on the ground so farcovered will shortly be presented to the Minister.(c) Provision for Persons Whose Further Edxicational Training hasbeen Prevented or Interrupted by War Service.The Minister of Labour and National Service made a statement in the Houseof Commons on the 25th March, 1943, indicating the general nature of thearrangements proposed, and this was followed by the issue of a pamphletdescribing the scheme in more detail. The scheme has had a good Press and somethousands of enquiries have been received by the Appointments Department ofthe Ministry of Labour and National Service. Of the two Committees under lord Hankey described in para. 13 (c) of the last Survey, that on Further Educa-tion and Training has been constituted, and that on the Appointments Depart-ment will be set up in the near future.(d) Questions relating to Demobilisation and Post-War employment policy calling for Early Decision.The Ministry of Labour and National Service has devoted special attentionto certain questions, affecting planning and organisation for the post-war period,on which early decisions are required before the necessary preparations can becarried further. A memorandum on this question (L.P. (43) 143) was consideredby the Lord Presidents Committee on the 25th June&apos;,* and provisional conclusions were reached as a basis for further action, including discussions with representa-tives of both sides of industry.* L.P. (43) 41st Conclusions, Minute 3.
(e) Oversea Settlement on Demobilisation.Despatches have been sent confidentially to the Dominions and SouthernRhodesia on the general question of migration after the war. At the same time,the respective Governments were asked for their views on the recommendationsof the Inter-Departmental Committee on. Oversea Settlement on Demobilisation,in whose report a scheme of free passages for demobilised members of the forces was suggested and certain ancillary matters were discussed.16. Maintenance of Employment.The Committee on Reconstruction Priorities is reviewing the question ofthe post-war maintenance of employment and is about to set on foot studies ona number of practical problems relating thereto.F. Social Services.17. The Beveridge Plan.Work has been proceeding in the various Departments in accordance with a plan drawn up by the Minister without Portfolio and approved by the Committeeon Reconstruction Priorities. The Committee has considered reports on anumber of major issues in particular, safeguards against abuse of unemploy-ment benefit, the use of approved societies as agents in the administration ofdisability benefit, the duration of disability benefit, some improvement in the beveridge proposals for widows&apos; pensions and the treatment of rent. TheCommittee has asked the Home Secretary to arrange for the examination of analternative scheme of workmen&apos;s compensation on different lines from those proposed in the Beveridge Report and to submit a detailed plan for considerationby the Committee.18. A Comprehensive Health Service.Since the last Survey, discussions have continued between the Ministry ofHealth and three representative groups appointed for the purpose by the medical profession, the voluntary hospitals and the major local authorities. The agreed programme indicated in the last Survey is being adhered to by the Ministry thatis to say, the general idea of three stages : (1) preliminary and confidential talks with these representative groups;(2) the publication of a general statement on the issues involved, in the formprobably of a White Paper, as a focus for public discussion;(3) the stage of settling the contents of draft legislation.The present position is that stage (1) is nearing its end; that stage (2) should probably be undertaken by a suitable publication about the end of August; andthat stage (3) should begin during next Session, if possible about the end ofthis year.Stage (1) has served to reveal some common ground between the three maininterests, but also a considerable amount of divergence of view both among them-selves and from the Ministry. Some intransigence has been shown by the medicalgroup in particular (which tentatively proposed a Royal Commission on the whole subject, but after discussion dropped the proposal at any rate for the time being).The situation in regard to this group has improved again lately, and in any case it is by no means.certain that all the views expressed by it reflect the feelings ofthe medical profession as a whole; indeed, there is evidence that the group itself is not at one on many of the major issues.The Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland continue tokeep closely in touch with the whole subject.. At the request of the Secretary ofState, Sir Hector Hetherington&apos;s Committee has submitted a short interim reportdealing with a number of points on which guidance was urgently required.19. Education.In accordance with the decision of the Lord Presidents Committee, thePresident of the Board of Education has caused a Bill embodying his proposalsfor educational reform to be drafted. This Bill, together with a draft white paper explaining the legislative and administrative changes proposed, is to beconsidered by the Lord Presidents Committee.As regards Scotland, the Scottish Advisory Council has presented interimreports on the recruitment and. supply of teachers and on technical and continuededucation. The School Building Committee has commenced its work byconsidering questions affecting the planning of schools.
The Scottish Youth Advisory Committee is taking action on the report fromthe Sub-Committee on the Registration of Youth. Other Sub-Committees are continuing to obtain and to consider evidence.20. Food.The Ministry of Food has been largely engaged in work connected with therecent United Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture. Close attention is being given to problems that will arise in the period immediately following the war, especially in the process of de-control and in coping with prospectiveworld shortages of major food-stuffs. On the longer view, progress is being madewith the study of arrangements for marketing food-stuffs, and enquiries are proceeding into other matters, such as the applicability of the Buffer Stocks plan to individual food products.21. Housing.Further progress on the preparatory work in regard to the future housing programme has been made by the Departments concerned.The Inter-Departmental Technical Committee investigating new methods of housing construction is about to make an interim report, and the Sub-committees of the Central Housing Advisory Committee for England and Wales dealing withthe design of new dwellings and rural housing, respectively, will be makingreports in the autumn. A further Sub-Committee is taking evidence on the part which private enterprise can play in post-war housing and on the question ofwhat must be done to ensure that all future dwellings are well built. The Sub-Committees of the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee continue in activeoperation.Joint memoranda on housing policy, long-term as well as short-term, preparedby the two Health Departments, have been-submitted by the Official Committee on post-War Internal Economic Problems, with a covering memorandum, to theReconstruction Problems .Committee.^ In the meantime, local authorities arebusy making the preliminary arrangements as regards the purchase of sites for a first year&apos;s programme and their lay-outs, t Scottish local authorities already ownmore than 8,000 acres of land, which wall be sufficient for 70,000-80,000 houses.Those local authorities who do not already own sufficient land for a year&apos;s housing programme have been informed that they should proceed to earmark the necessaryland.G-Common Services.22. Toivn and Country Planning England and Wales.(a) Legislation.The Town and Country Planning (Interim Development) Bill has passed through all its. stages in the House of Commons and is aw^waiting third reading in the House of Lords.4Powers and procedure for the acquisition of land in reconstruction areas arestill under consideration by the Harrison Committee.Other matters arising on the Uthwatt Committee Report, namely, thedevelopment rights scheme for undeveloped areas, the periodic levy on increases in annual site values in built-up areas, and the 1939 &quot;Ceiling,&quot; are beingconsidered by a Conference on the Control of Land Use, representative of theMinistry of Town and&apos; Country Planning, the Treasury and the Board of InlandRevenue, in the light of proposals formulated by-the&apos; Minister of Town and country Planning-(b) Research.A small research organisation has been set up in the Ministry of Town and1Country Planning to assemble and collate, preliminary to the process of national planning, information on- all; forjmv of land resources and conditions- affectingtheir use;(c) Administration.The regional planning organisation of the Ministry is now in-full operation.It has concentrated on building up a local planning&apos; organisation: for the areas-which will be brought under control by the Interim Development Bilk   The1machinery of planning in the areas under control has also been overhauled and* R.P. (43) 24.f&apos; The Minister-ol Health stated in. the House of; Commons on Sth, July,. 1943, that up tothat-date, repli^s-from 586locaLauthorities^ relating tD nearly 130,000 houses.had. been received;(O.B. Vol. 390, No. 86, Col. 2246.)% This Bill received- third reading-in- the lords on- the 6th July, nnd:haS&apos;be:eir returned tothe Commons for consideration of Lords&apos; amendments.
substantial improvements have been secured, especially in arranging extendedco-operation between neighbouring local authorities. The survey work being done by local authorities is steadily increasing, and is being dovetailed withresearch work done directly by the Ministry. Work is proceeding actively, massociation with other Departments where appropriate, on such problems as therestoration of excavated land for agriculture and other purposes, the post-waruse of surplus defence works and war factories, commons and footpaths. &amp;c.A panel of advisers on the reconstruction of blitzed city centres has beenappointed and is working with the Ministry. It has visited Southampton andCoventry, and has arranged further visits to other heavily blitzed towns.Measures to increase the present short supply of planning experts, by furtherrecruitment and intensive training, are under active consideration.(d) Roads in Built-Up Areas.The Minister of War Transport, with the concurrence of the Minister of town and Country Planning and the Secretary of State for Scotland, has appointed a small Committee of experts (which includes representatives of the planning Ministries and ef the architectural and planning professions) with thefollowing terms of reference : &quot; To consider the design and layout most appropriate to various types of roads in built-up areas, with due regard to safety, the free flow of road traffic, economy, and the requirements of town planning, and to make recommendations.&apos;&apos;Town and Country Planning Scotland.It is proposed to introduce the Town and Country Planning (InterimDevelopment) Bill for Scotland* immediately the Bill for England and Wales hasbeen passed.At the suggestion of the Secretary of State, the Clyde Valley regional planning Advisory Committee, which was set up in 1927 to deal primarily withroad problems in the Clyde Valley area, has been reconstituted on a broad basisto deal with all the major planning problems in the area. The area covered bythe Committee includes the Counties of Dunbarton, Lanark and Renfrew, partsof Stirling and Ayr, together with all the large burghs in the area. Seventeenlocal planning authorities are involved, and. it is proposed to appoint a planningconsultant to prepare an outline plan for the whole area into which the plans of the individual local authorities would be fitted..23. Post-War Building and Construction.(a) Supply of Materials.On the materials side, the Ministry of Works has agreed with the Board ofTrade the industries producing building materials for which the Ministry ofWorks should be directly responsible in any investigation of post-war difficulties,including the development of potential capacity. It is proposed to review thepost-war position with the industries concerned.As regards the technique of building generally, the various Study Groupscontinue to make progress, and it is hoped that by October next&apos; reports will havebeen received covering most of the field of their investigations.(b) Experimental Development.The Minister of Works has appointed a Controller of Experimental BuildingDevelopment who will work in parallel with a Building Costs Research Officer tofacilitate and examine critically all new developments in building techniquedesigned to improve standards and reduce costs.(c) Review of Foreign Service Accommodation.The Minister of Works has appointed, in consultation Avith the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, a Committee to review the accommodation andfurnishing requirements of the Foreign Service in the light of the proposals forthe reform of the Foreign Service contained in Cmd. 6420.

in the sphere of fuel and power on the transition from war to peace, inparticular : (i) securing the considerable increase in man-power, which will be requiredwhen the war ends, to supply particularly the heavy coal exportdemand which is expected;(ii) the stabilisation of fuel prices, which are highly important in relationto the cost of living;(iii) the maintenance, during the transitional period, of distribution controls,irrespective of what is decided regarding the future organisation ofthe fuel industries.As regards the different fuel industries, the position is :  (a) Coal.Under the White Paper on Coal of last year (Cmd. 6364), the existingRegional organisation of the Ministry is to be continued &apos;&apos; pending a final decision by Parliament on the future of the industry.&quot; Meanwhile, both sides of the coalmining industry are giving joint consideration to certain problems of future organisation.(b) Electricity.The proposals for the comprehensive reorganisation of generation anddistribution of electricity, mentioned in para. 19 (a) of the last Survey, have been referred to a new Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Problems Committee,under the chairmanship of the Minister of Fuel and Power.

The objective of this policy must be to supply the country&apos;s demand forheat, power and light in the most economic way, subject to (i) the need for con-servation of certain types of coal of which the reserves may be particularlylimited, and (ii) the use of the fuel processing industries as a source of rawmaterials for the chemical industry. Particular attention is being given, in thisconnection, to the problems of domestic heating, which are of importance inconnection with the post-war housing programme.25.

Among the more important matters on which specificdecisions will be required are the administrative and financial responsibility forhighways; the policy to be adopted in regard to the provision of motorways forthe exclusive use of fast road vehicles; the transfer to the State of an additionalmileage of the principal roads; and the priority of works to be put in hand.* This Bill has now passed the Committee stage in the Lords.

It was arranged; that the Council will present annual reports, in a form suitable for. communication to Members of Parliament, since theCouncil considers itself precluded by the undertakings it has given to witnessesfrom agreeing to. the communication of the reports already&apos; submitted.
