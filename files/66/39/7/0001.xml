/if.i.^2THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT     &apos;-.---- 25Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET Copy No. 33W.P. (43) 307.13th July, 1943.WAR CABINET.FORECAST OF MONTHLY LOSS RATES OF DRY CARGO SHIPS.Note by the Prime Minister.AT the Casablanca Conference, General Somervell, U.S.A., estimated thefuture monthly loss ratio during 1943 at 2-6 per cent. When I expressed theopinion that this rate was too pessimistic he sent me the attached figures(Appendix 1).   I replied by the letter reproduced in Appendix 2.The matter has now gone further forward than I then contemplated. Thefigures up to the end of March amounted to 1 - 9 per cent., and the total figuresover the seven months in question, of which six were unknown at Casablanca,now amount to 1 - 6 per cent. (Details in Appendix 3.) This immense saving hasalready been partly allowed for in our calculations and plans, but if maintainedshould require a further drastic re-examination of these in a favourable sense.Of course, the utmost economy is still essential in the use of all shipping.(Initialled) W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,13th July, 1943.

However I hazardthe forecast that for the four months including December and January a rateof 2 per cent, or less will rule. I cannot risk my reputation as a Prophet byprobing ahead further.Yours sincerely,WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Lieut.-General B. B. Somervell,Anfa Camp,Casablanca.P.S. Write to me if I am wrong on the 1st April.

These are the loss ratios agreed with the American authoritiesThemain reason for the difference between General Somervell&apos;s figure of1-9 per cent, for December 1942 and the figure of 2-3 per cent, aboveappears to be that General Somervell has taken a four-weekly period forDecember (and five-weekly periods for certain other months), while thefigures above refer to calendar months.
