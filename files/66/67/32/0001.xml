Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 82.Vlth July, 1945.CABINET.NON-REPATRIABLE REFUGEES.Memorandum by the Minister of Education (Acting Chairman of the CabinetCommittee on the Reception and Accommodation of Refugees).I desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the proposals of the Com-mittee for the Reception and Accommodation of Refugees as regards the questionof non-repatriable refugees.2. The full scope of this problem cannot be properly assessed for some timeto come, and the Committee feel strongly that for the present all refugeesdisplaced as a result of the war must be regarded as eventually repatriable, andthat a final decision to regard any as non-repatriable can only ultimately bereached after a careful review of all the relevant circumstances obtaining atthe time.3. The Committee have accordingly considered the existing methods ofgiving temporary relief to the various categories of refugees, and to the respectivefunctions in this field of U.N.R.R.A. and the Intergovernmental Committee onRefugees, which was set up as a result of the International Conference at Evianin 1938.4. The Committee are strongly of the opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom cannot continue to contribute to the relief of refugees in the proportions which at present govern the finances of the Inter-governmental Committee. Under existing arrangements the operational expensesof the Intergovernmental Committee are divided in equal proportions betweenthe United States and the United Kingdom Governments, a division which, ofcourse, in no way reflects the financial capacity of the two countries. In the caseof U.N.R.R.A., on the other hand, the expenses of operation, are shared between a number of Governments in proportion to their financial capacity.5. In the Committee&apos;s view, therefore, it should be clearly recognised thatthe task of giving relief to refugees is in general one for U.N.R.R.A. The Inter-governmental Committee should not undertake this task except as regards certain specific categories of refugees in conditions where it was clear that these didnot come within U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s mandate. Nor should it be automatically assumed that because certain categories of refugees did not qualify for relief from u.N.R.R.A., they should be regarded as the responsibility of the Intergovern-mental Committee. The manner in which effect would be given to these principlesis set out in the Annex to this paper.6. Ultimately, the time will come when a &quot;hard core&quot; of refugees willbe agreed to be non-repatriable and their future will have to be provided for.The Cabinet Committee on Refugees have expressed no view of this yet, butit may well be found desirable to entrust the task to the IntergovernmentalCommittee. Before this could be considered, however, they feel that it Wouldbe essential to reorganise that body, and, in particular, to adjust the existing financial arrangements so as to provide that the United Kingdom would contributein proportion to its means instead of, as now, bearing half the burden (the UnitedStates bearing the other half) of all operational expenditure.12845   [30237]
7. The Committee feel that it would be necessary, in the first place, to com-municate the above views to the United States Government (who are directly concerned as regards both U.N.R.E.A. and the Intergovernmental Committee)and to try to get them to agree.8. I invite my colleagues (a) to approve the principles set out in the annex to this paper, and (b) to authorise the Foreign Office to communicate these principles to the United States Government and to try to secure their acceptanceof them as suggested in paragraph 7.R.  K.  L.   .17th July, 1945.ANNEX.- (a) The present relief operations in which the Intergovernmental Committeeis engaged with the approval of His Maiesty&apos;s Government and of the UnitedStates Government and of the Executive Committee should be reviewed in orderto ascertain whether any of the categories of refugees thus being relieved can beheld to come within the mandate, of U.N.R.R.A. If so, arrangements should bemade to transfer the responsibility for their relief to U.N.R.R.A. as soon aspossible.(b) Any proposals which may in future be made to the IntergovernmentalCommittee to undertake the relief of specific categories of refugees should not be approved until it is quite clear that they are outside the scope of whateverU.N.R.R.A.&apos;s mandate may be at the time. Similarly, in the event of u.N.R.R.A,&apos;s mandate being enlarged, proposals for relief which the Inter-governmental Committee bad previously been authorised to accept should be reviewed to ascertain whether they were now properly an LT.N.R.R.A. respon-sibility.(c) When asked to approve any proposals to undertake the relief of specificcategories of refugees, the Governments represented on the Executive Committeeof the Intergovernmental Committee (in the first place His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment) should be furnished with as full particulars as possible of the reasons tosupport an assumption prima facie that the refugees in question would prove tobe non-repatriable. It would be clearly understood that, unless these reasonswere found to be adequate, His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, would be unable to approve the assumption of relief activities on behalf of the refugees inquestion by the Intergovernmental Committee and would press for their inclusion,at any rate for the time being, within the mandate of U.N.R.R.A.
