naval SITUATION.Continental Ports.1. It is reported from Lublin that the port of Danzig is now open to shipping. -The cruiser Leipzig arrived at Kiel from Aabenraa on the 30th. Over100,000 tons of ex-German cargo shipping have now been sailed from Flensburg.Although berthing facilities are very limited the port of Narvik can nowhandle some 200,000 tons of iron ore every month.As from tire 1st August, Amsterdam should be able to refit seven large ships at any one time. A route from the West Scheldt to Dordrecht, via the SouthBeveland Canal, is now open to shipping. .At both Jersey and Guernsey port repairs are now about 30 per cent, complete.Mediterranean.2.   On the 2nd HALS. Aries (fleet minesweeper) was damaged by a mine oftTrieste.The destruction in the port of Piraeus has been very extensive. All quaysidecranes have been destroyed and only one cargo shed remains undamaged. As aresult all discharging has to be carried out by ships&apos; derricks on to the quays orinto the few lighters still remaining. A maximum of 5.000 tons daily can be discharged.East Indies.3. During a recent patrol in the Malacca Strait H.M. S/M Thrasher sankthree coastal craft and took three prisoners.Pacific.4. On the 28th U.S. cruisers and destroyers sank several small enemy shipsduring a sweep in the Sea of Okhotsk.U.S. submarines during recent patrols in Japanese waters have sunk aU-boat, a destroyer escort, a minesweeper, one large and 18 smaller cargo ships,three tankers and a number of small craft.On the 2nd U.S. naval aircraft laid mines off the S.W. coast of Korea and sank a submarine chaser. On the 4th they damaged two destroyers, a patrol craft anda transport in the Yellow Sea.During the taking of Okinawa, the U.S. Pacific Fleet lost 4,900 killed and about 4.800 were wounded.5. During recent operations by the British Pacific Fleet against theSakishima Islands, a number of attacks were made on the Fleet by suicideaircraft. The majority of the attacks were made against the Fleet carriers and,though the majority failed, five suicide pilots succeeded in diving their aircraft on to the decks of carriers. H.M.S. Indefatigable was hit twice on the same day and another carrier was hit twice on successive days. H.M.S. Victorious wasalso hit during these attacks. In no case did any carrier suffer more than minor damage, nor was it necessary for any ship to withdraw from the action. In eachcase the flight deck was soon cleared so that within a very short time aircraft were both taking off and landing on. In one case the flight deck was in use within20 minutes after a suicide aircraft had crashed. The operations of our Fleetwere in no way affected and it remained at full strength throughout. In additionto the five hits, there were three near misses and in two cases suicide aircraft,having actually touched the decks of carriers, were carried over the side by theirown momentum and exploded harmlessly in the sea. A third suicide aircrafttipped the superstructure of one Fleet carrier but dived right across the shipbefore crashing into the sea. The Japanese paid a heavy price in aircraft andpilots for the minor damage sustained by the British ships. During these operations 140 Japanese aircraft were destroyed or damaged, and in all these attacks and in all other forms of enemy action during these operations the BritishPacific Fleet lost 70 men killed and 34 seriously wounded.HALS. Ulster (destroyer) was the only ship with the British Fleet which^as^ rendered inoperative throughout the two months of operations against theSakishima Islands.M in esiveeping.6. German minesweepers, operating under British control, have destroyed76 ground and 77 moored mines.   About 360 German minesweepers will be used
in further clearances off the German, Dutch and Norwegian coasts. the extensive operations in the western Baltic are entirely the work of Germanflotillas; German minesweepers have preceded all movements of shipping in this area. German R-boats are now clearing the Skagerrak minefield, and other german minesweepers are operating between Stavanger and Lister.An approach channel to Oslo has been opened, and British minesweepershave cleared the harbour itself.The northern approach channel to Bergen has been completed by British andGerman minesweepers.Up to the present, 104 ground and 506 moored mines have been destroyed during operations for the reopening of continental ports.During the week 246 British mines have been destroyed.Between November 1944 and March 1945, U.S. minesweepers have destroyed1,600 mines off New Caledonia; this was an Australian lay of British moored mines.Shipping Casualties.7. On the 29th a Swedish ship of 5,468 tons was damaged by a mine off theLister, and on the 3rd the ex-German s.s. Patria (16,595 tons) was damagedeither by mine or sabotage off the Texel.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.8. On the 1st the withdrawal began of British and U.S. troops from theWismar and Magdeburg &quot; cushions,&quot; and from those parts of Anhalt, Halle-Merseburg and Thuringia which lie in the eventual Russian zone of occupation.Evacuation of the Wismar area was completed on the evening of the same day and that of Magdeburg by the 4th. U.S. troops further south are due to complete their withdrawal on the 5th.On the 1st also, British and U.S. troops began to move into their allottedsectors in Berlin.   France is represented by a small contingent of French troops.Burma.9.   Monsoon conditions continue to limit operations in this theatre.There have been no signs of a serious attempt by the enemy to break out ofthe Pegu Yomas although a large party was reported to be attempting to filteracross the road-railwav axis 30 miles north of Toungoo.On the Mawchi road slow progress continues, hampered by extensive mine-fields, bad weather and determined Japanese rearguard actions. There is still,however, considerable activity on the east bank of the Sittang River betweenShwegyin and Mokpalin, but the two bridgeheads on the west bank have notbeen enlarged.Pacific.Philippines.10. Luzon. Since TJ.S. troops advancing from north and south met in theCagayan Valley on the 26th June, there has been little to report. South ofAparri an advance has been made on the road running to the N.E. tip of the island.Stiff opposition has been met to the S.E. of Kiangan, but Filipino guerrillashave advanced east and south from the Cervantes area and captured several smalltowns.Borneo.11. Brunei Bay. Australian troops now hold a 125 miles stretch of theNorth Borneo coastline from Miri to Kimanis Bay.On the 27th June, they entered Beaufort without opposition and have sinceadvanced 8 miles up the Beaufort-Jesselton railway and one mile S.E. of Beaufort.Baclas was occupied on the 2nd July.12.

In south and centralBurma, the Tactical Air Force attacked communications, store areas, head-quarters, buildings, bashas and rivercraft.Japan.17. Night attacks were made by a total of 1,007 Super-Fortresses (threemissing) on urban areas on Kyushu and Honshu; a total of about 6,500 tons was dropped and the results observed were good. A further 513 similar aircraft(5 missing) dropped, in daylight attacks, over 3,500 tons on the arsenals at Osakaand Nagoya and other industrial targets; during these operations 27 enemy aircraft were destroyed. A small-scale attack (186 tons) was made on an oil plant at Kudamatso (48 miles S.W. of Kure), and a similar attack (268 tons) on an oil refinery at Shimotsui (95 miles W. of Osaka).Sea-mines were laid on four nights by a total of 104 Super-Fortresses.Four airfields in the Tokyo area were attacked by 100 Mustangs (3 missing);13 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground and a further 19 in combat.Appendix YII gives bomb tonnages dropped on Japan by Super Fortresses.Pacific.18. In Formosa, a series of small operations were directed upon a sugarfactory and gun positions. In addition, escorted Liberators dropped 38 tonson Toyohara airfield.In the Philippines, tactical aircraft continued to provide support for Alliedground forces on Luzon and Mindanao; about 1,000 sorties are reported to havebeen flown in these operations.In Borneo, enemy defences at Balikpapan and Manggar, in preparation forthe Allied landing, were repeatedly attacked; Liberators, Mitchells andLightnings dropped over 1,000 tons of bombs in these operations. On the 1st,a further 134 tons were dropped in support of the landing operations, and airfields in the Bandjermasin area and at Tawao were also attacked. Enemy aircraft,on a small scale, ineffectively attacked Allied shipping off Balikpapan. R.A.A.F.fighters and fighter-bombers provided ground support for Allied troops in theBrunei Bay and Miri areas. Off the south-west coast of Borneo, Liberatorsattacked enemy coastal shipping.In the Celebes, Liberators and Catalinas carried out numerous small-scale operations against enemy airfields.In the Wewak area, Allied aircraft, principally RA.A.F. Beauforts, mademany effective attacks on enemy positions. R.N.ZA.F. Corsairs flew a totalof about 500 sorties in support of ground forces in southern Bougainville andin attacks on enemy targets in the Rabaul and Kavieng areas; U.S. aircraftalso attacked these latter targets.Liberators and other U.S. aircraft made a number of successful attacks onsmall shipping off the N.E. coast of Malaya, off the China coast and on the riverat Shanghai.
