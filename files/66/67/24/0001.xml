Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1945.beers strictly limited.   It is issuedCP. (45) 74.llth July, 1945.CABINET.DISPOSAL OF THE ITALIAN FLEET.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.DOUBT existed under the original Short Military Terms of Surrenderconcerning the extent of the right to dispose of the Italian Fleet. This doubt wasremoved by Marshal Badoglio&apos;s subsequent signature of the Long Instrument of surrender and the Protocol amending the Cunningham-De Courten agreement,which explicitly reserved the right of disposal. The effective units of the italian fleet of importance are 2 modern &quot;Littorio&quot; Class battleships.3 older &quot; Cavour &quot; Class battleships.8 light cruisers.10 Fleet destroyers.22 torpedo boats.20 corvettes.28 submarines.A detailed statement is at Annex I.2. The Russian demand for 1 battleship, 1 cruiser, 8 destroyers and 4 sub-marines, first made in Moscow in October 1943, was agreed at Teheran by thePrime Minister and President Roosevelt. At a Press Conference on the3rd March, 1944, the latter referred to the Russian share in language suggesting that it was one-third of the Italian Fleet. There is no question whatever that theagreement covered the ships listed above and no more. The actual proportion ofthe Italian Fleet involved is less than one-quarter.3. Subsequently, the Combined Chiefs of Staff raised objection to an imme-diate transfer of the Italian ships on the ground that the campaign in Italy wascritical and the transfer might seriously prejudice Italian co-operation on thelines of communication and in the dockyards. At the Prime Ministers suggestionthe solution was adopted of transferring on temporary loan to the Soviet Navy a united States cruiser and the British ships Royal Sovereign, 8 old &quot; Town &quot;Class destroyers, and 4 modern submarines. One &quot; Town &quot; Class destroyer hasbeen sunk by the enemy and one submarine accidentally sunk by a British aircraft.4. The position therefore, to-day, is that the Russians have an unsatisfiedmortgage on the Italian Fleet for 1 battleship, 1 cruiser, 8 destroyers and4 submarines, but hold equivalent ships less the two which have been lost. Inaddition, the following Allied claims have been lodged :  (a) United Kingdom. The Prime Minister notified the President in March1944 that we might wish to keep the two &quot;Littorio&quot; Class battle-ships as compensation for our losses in the Mediterranean, and tomake good the battleships whose laying down we suspended owingto the war.[30205]
(b) France. After   President  Roosevelt&apos;s  Press   Conference,  mentionedabove, the French claimed 2 light cruisers, 16 destroyers, 8 corvettes,10 submarines and 18 M.T.B.&apos;s. They asked, if these ships were notavailable, for equivalent British or United States tonnage. their request was treated as an impertinence and no reply was returned.(c) Greece. Immediately after the Italian surrender the Greeks asked for  cruisers, 4 destroyers, 8 escorts and 4 submarines, as replacementfor losses at Italian hands, and were assured of sympathetic consideration. They have recently expanded this claim to coverGermany and Italy, and ask for 2 light cruisers (or 1 heavy cruiser),6 destroyers, 8 escorts, 6 submarines and auxiliaries,(cl) Yugoslavia. After the Italian surrender the Yugoslavs made a tentative claim for replacement of losses at Italian hands.Neither the Americans nor any other Ally have stated a claim.5. The Italian Navy, since the surrender, has contributed to the Alliedeffort to the full extent of its capabilities. The Italian dockyards have been a valuable addition to our resources and they are continuing to meet our demands for the Far Eastern war. The Italian Navy has therefore played a materialpart in the working of Italy&apos;s passage.6. Italy&apos;s contribution to the Allied effort against Germany will no doubtaffect the military terms imposed in the peace settlement. Italy&apos;s neighboursare, however, entitled to ask that the peace settlement will give them reasonablesecurity against Italian aggression. The Italian Navy is now on paper thelargest in the Mediterranean. The French and the British Fleets will be engageciin the Far East for some time to come, and the depleted French Navy is unableat present to re-build itself in French dockyards. The Mediterranean Allies will therefore expect the Italian Navy to undergo cuts by way of disarmament, apart altogether from the satisfaction of their claims. The Admiralty also wish to insist upon the total suppression of the Italian submarine fleet.7. The problem, therefore, is to find a settlement which, without per-manently estranging Italy, will meet inescapable Allied claims and reduce Italy&apos;sNavy to a size acceptable to her neighbours. The following is the policy pro-posed :- (a) Russian claim to be met in full, i.e., 1 &quot; Cavour &quot; class battleship, 16-inch cruiser, 8 destroyers, 4 submarines.- (b) Greece. 2 6-inch cruisers to be transferred and 1 further damaged6-inch cruiser for cannibalisation. The Greeks have been most gener-ously supplied with destroyers, corvettes and submarines from theRoyal Navy on loan and it is undesirable that they should equipthemselves in these classes from any but British sources. They have paid for none of the British ships, and some of their own ships, inrespect of whose loss they are claiming reparation, were old. justice and Greek prestige should, therefore, be satisfied by the proposed allocation of cruisers.(c) France. The difficulty about meeting a French claim for reparation istwo-fold; the Italian Navy largely saved itself from the Germans,whereas the French Navy did not; and, secondly, the transfer of italian ships to the French will exacerbate the bitterness, between thetwo countries. The French will thus have to be content with theallocation of German ships proposed in CP. (45) 67.(d) Yugoslavs. The transfer of Italian ships to the Yugoslav Navy is notrecommended. The Yugoslav Navy has one British corvette on loanand the Yugoslav contribution at sea has been small. Certainly notmore than one or two torpedo boats would be appropriate.8. We clo not, as things have turned out, require either of the two&quot; Littorio &quot; Class battleships one of which is damaged for the Far Easternwar. The question of adding these ships to our post-war seagoing Fleet requirescareful consideration, as they have certain drawbacks. Their endurance is lower than that of comparable&apos;British battleships; they are more lightly constructed,have inadequate distilling equipment, and the provision of ammunition reserves and spares would be a difficulty. Major alterations and modernisation would undoubtedly be necessary to fit these ships for our own Fleet, and by the time this could be completed they would be not less than 10 years old.    Full technical
examination in a British yard and seagoing- trials would be necessary before wecould decide whether this is worth while. The ships would, however, be useful to us, in any event, for training and other purposes. The main consideration isthat such powerful ships should not be in unreliable, particularly Russian, hands.Accordingly, the following policy is proposed in respect of the &apos;&apos; Littorios &quot; :  (a) We should claim both (or one only if the United States also make a&apos;  claim) in order to ensure that the ships do not fall into unreliablehands. We should persist in this claim at &apos;&apos; Terminal &apos;&apos; and untilthe Russian demand for a battleship has been liquidated by theprovision of one of the old &quot; Cavour &quot; Class, as we have alwaysstipulated.(b) We- should appropriate  the  ships  at the  peace  settlement  unless,Ultimately, it is considered necessary to be more lenient with regardto the Italian Fleet. In this event, the Admiralty would be preparedto consider leaving the two &quot; Littorios &quot; in Italian hands instead ofthe two old &quot;Cavour&quot; Class which would otherwise compose thethe Italian battleship force.9. The result of the policy in paragraphs 7 and 8 would be to leave theItalians with a fleet of the order of 2 battleships, 5 light cruisers, 2 Fleetdestroyers, 20 torpedo boats, 20 corvettes and sundry auxiliaries, but nosubmarines. These latter are largely worn out, and after being stripped of usefulequipment should be sunk in deep water. Such a fleet would be fully adequate for Italy, observing that she is likely to lose her overseas colonies. It will alsobe large enough to form some balance to the French in the Mediterranean without causing undue alarm to Mediterranean countries.10. The settlement with the Italian Navy has, of course, to be fitted intothe general picture of the whole Italian peace settlement. The proposals inthis paper take account of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum on the peace treaty (CP. (45) 64) and are founded upon the detailed Military Clausesapproved by the Chiefs of Staff. As already indicated, they constitute a compromise between our desire to keep Italy friendly and to satisfy the legitimatedemands of our Allies. It is assumed that any discussions at &quot;Terminal&quot;concerning the disposal of the Italian Navy will primarily concern the satis-faction of the Russian claim, and that the general settlement in respect of theItalian Navy, including other Allied claims, will be reserved for the discussionsconcerning the Peace Treaty. It certainly appears desirable that before final decisions are taken concerning the general settlement, the Dominions should he advised of the proposals in this paper. It may also be considered necessary toinform the interested Allies before any announcement is made.11. There remains the question of the return of Royal Sovereign and theother ships upon satisfaction of the Russian claim against Italy. Apart from asentimental wish to recover Royal Sovereign, we see no practical advantage inrecovering the ships on loan. All would be placed in reserve and, in due course,find their way to the scrap-yard. Accordingly, the Admiralty would noc objectto these British ships being left with the Russians if we could thereby secure some countervailing advantage in the discussions concerning the German Fleetor in negotiating some other political objective, or for a financial consideration.n. h.Admiralty, S.W.1,11th July, 1945.
