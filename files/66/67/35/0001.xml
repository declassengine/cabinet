AT their meeting on the 12th July (CM. (45) 14th Conclusions, Minute 4)the Cabinet appointed a Committee consisting of the Minister of Labour and national Service, the Minister of Fuel and Power, a representative of the Ministerof War Transport, and myself as Chairman, to consider the issues raised in cp. (45) 60 and 66 and to submit their recommendations to the Cabinet in aweek&apos;s time.2. The whole subject has been re-examined at my request by officials of theDepartments principally concerned (the Ministry of Fuel and Power, the Ministryof War Transport and the Ministry of Production) and their report and recom-mendations are annexed.3. The members of the Cabinet Committee concur in the recommendationsset out in paragraph 19 of Annex I, and I ask for the endorsement of these recommendations by the Cabinet so that the necessary action may be taken at theThree-Power Conference at Potsdam.O. L.Board of Trade. Millbank, S.W-. 1,19th July, 1945.ANNEX  I.Survey of General Coal Position by an Official Working Party Arisingfrom an Investigation of CP, (45) 60 and 66.1. The Lord Presidents Committee at their 16th Meeting on the 21st March,considered a Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power (L.P. (45) 61) onthe budget for the Coal Year 1945-46. That budget assumed the production of188-3 million tons for the year ending the 30th April, 1946, and making noallowances for exports to liberated Europe after August, showed an overall deficit of 4 million tons. Subsequent experiences suggests that the output will be lower than was estimated and so far no reduction in the internal consumption is insight and the deficit will therefore be greater.On the 12th July (CM. (45) 14th Conclusions) the Cabinet had before them aMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power and by the Minister of war transport (CP. (45) 60 and 66 respectively) on the provision of bunker coal for additional shipping released from the Baltic. The Cabinet remitted this matter to the sub-committee under the President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Production for further consideration and report within a week. Under theinstructions of the Chairman, this question with all its implications has been examined by an official working party, who submit the following report.General Background.2. The Coal situation is serious in the United States, worse in the UnitedKingdom, and desperate in liberated Europe. The Potter-Hynclley Mission have found that N.W. Europe and the Mediterranean will require to import over30 million tons by the 30th April, 1946, to meet their bare needs (not much morethan 50 per cent, of the 1938 consumption rate). Bad though our outlook is, theContinental outlook&apos; is immensely worse, and we may expect to be subjected to[30244] r,
criticism that with our total internal consumption approaching the 1939 figureswe cannot help materially to meet the dire needs of Europe. At the same time weshare with the United States an obligation to find some coal to meet Europeanneeds, at least to the extent sufficient to compensate for the consumpion by our forces. The estimate made by the Potter-Hyndley Mission was that the UnitedStates, United Kingdom and South Africa might continue to provide at the rateof 455,000 tons a month. The United Kingdom export programme up to the endof August includes 90,000 tons of good quality coal suitable for locomotives, made possible by the assumption by the United States -of responsibility for bunkeringships in the United States &quot;for the round Atlantic voyage, and for supplyingcertain coaling stations hitherto a United.Kingdom responsibility.3. The main contribution for Europe is to be Western Germany, who havebeen given an export target of 25 million tons, 10 million tons of this to beavailable by the 31st December. The present estimate is that only about250,000 tons a month may be expected in July and August. The allowance in reaching an output commensurate with the gross expectation is bound to leadto a demand that the United States and United Kingdom contribution shouldbe stepped up immediately and reduced later in the year. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment may be pressed to supply more coal for liberated areas or to show why thedemand cannot be met from the United Kingdom. If more coal is to come fromthe United States a very strong case will have to be made, especially as theshipping makes supply from North America more difficult. The suggestion thatthe United States should continue to supply 90,000 tons a month for bunkeringafter the United Kingdom have ceased to supply an equivalent amount of coalof the same quality to North-West Europe, in addition to other commitments,has not found favour with the Washington Coal Committee, and further explana-tion of our position will be necessary if there is to be a chance of acceptance.4. The following shows production and consumption in the two countries for 1939 and 1944, in million tons :  United States. United Kingdom.1939.       1944, 1939. 1944.Internal    .........      428      653      184-8      187-8Export and Bunkers     ...        14        31        46-5 5-6Production ......      442      684      231-3      191-9The United States have increased their production by 238 million tons, andtheir internal consumption by 225 million tons, or nearly 50 per cent. The UnitedKingdom have suffered a loss in production of 39-4 million tons and haveincreased internal consumption by 3 million tons only. The shortage of supplieshas been met by a reduction of 40 - 9 million tons in exports, and a reduction of stocks of 1 - 5 million tons.5. Within these figures there have been increases (in million tons) in consumption for gas (1-5), electricity (8-2) and direct industrial use (14-7),against which the domestic consumption fell (13-8). The broad position is thatthe whole of the industrial expansion of this country in war has been met by areduction in the domestic consumption, and that the loss of output has been met by reduced exports. It is obvious that such a result would have been impossible without a very rigorous economy in consumption in relation to industrial output,and also that the degree of economy in consumption already reached makes itcertain that no considerable quantities could be found for exports or additionalbunkering without a deliberate change in the pattern or a reduction in outputof industry, or a further diminution in domestic supplies which would be difficultto impose without arousing serious leactions.6. Despite the depressing outlook, the following quantities of UnitedKingdom coal have been exported or promised for S.H.A.E.F. oi- S.A.C.M.E.D. :  Loading ForMonth. North-West Europe.   Mediterranean. Total.May ... 184,000 52,000 236,000June ... 197,800 41,700 239,500July ... 212,125 41,700 253,825August ... 197,200 41.400 238,600September ... 110,000* 40.000 150,0001,117,925* Excludes coal in lieu of United States bunker coal, and also additional quantities of very low grade fuels, below the United Kingdom usable standards.
These figures appear inconsistent with the suggestion that such exports mustbe at the expense of the home consumer, since, if this were so, the coal would notbe physically available. In fact the exported coal has been at the expense of stocks, which, instead of being built up to meet the heavy winter needs, have fallenand are now dangerously low, especially for the railways and gasworks.7. The above considerations must be borne in mind in assessing the capacityof the United Kingdom to assume further obligations for exporting coal. If thecurrent year&apos;s estimated production of 188-3 million tons is realised, and ourinternal consumption were reduced to the 1939 level, we should be able to exportonly 3-5 million tons a year, or less than 300,000 tons a month, includingbunkering. This is about the quantity required for existing bunkering commit-ments, allowing for the new shipping (70,000 tons) and increased use of previouslyexisting shipping (30,000 tons)f It follows that every ton of coal (except very lowgrades) exported to the Liberated Areas would be at the expense of Britishindustrial public service or domestic consumers.8. The continuation of exports on the level so far authorised cannot go onindefinitely unless there is an increase in production, which the most optimisticprophet is unlikely to forecast, or a reduction in consumption, which, as explained above, is extremely difficult. It is, however, possible that (a) the reduction in heavy industries following on the reduced output of munitions, unless offset byan increase in demands arising from reconversion, e.g., for the building industry,and (b) a transfer of labour to lighter, e.cj., textile industries, might lead toreduced demands from industry. It is also possible that a certain amount of conversion or reversion to oil-fuel, though financially uneconomical, may release a small amount of coal. Without further research than is possible in the time available, no reliable estimate can be made of the extent of such reductions in consumption.   Present indications are that they cannot be large.9. To sum up the general situation, it appears extremely doubtful whetherthe United Kingdom can continue to supply coal, save in very low grades, for north-West Europe and the Mediterranean or to find the extra coal necessary for making full use of &quot;the shipping now available, without a reduction in supplies to United Kingdom industry.Provision of Extra Bunker Coal.10. We turn now to the narrower aspect of the, problem of finding coal of thequality necessary to bunker extra shipping.   The proposal examined was (a) Having regard to the cessation of convoys and also the relaxation ofsmoke control thus made possible, can the net quantity of extra large coal required for the new shipping and more extensive use of existingshipping be offset by an all-over dilution of bunker coal ?(b) If so, could the extra coal of other qualities be found without impairingindustry ? and(c) Is there any possibility of immediately assessing the reductions in con-sumption that might follow from the reconversion steps likely in thecurrent coal year, or from the conversion of industrial plant, whenpracticable, to the use of oil-fuel ?11. This proposal has been examined in detail by the Ministry of Fuel and power on the data provided by the Ministry of War Transport of the minimumtypes of coal acceptable as bunkers. This report by the Ministry of Fuel and power is given in Annex II. It will be seen that, although the quantity of largescreened coal for bunkers could be reduced by nearly half a million tons a year, theprovision of the substitutes would create as serious a situation in the gas andother industries as would be created on the railways by the reduction in the supplyof large coal, which the change was designed to avoid.12. With regard to the question of whether the extra coal required forbunkers could be found without impairing industry, it appears that the exportsalready authorised have left the gas industry dangerously short and that in orderto build up by the 31st October a reserve of weeks consumption necessary for thewinter months, the weekly supplies should be increased, by 70,000 tons&apos;. Minorcontributions towards this need, including the possible utilisation of 15,000 tonsa week of opencast coal, 3,500 tons by economies in other industries, and from further use of water gas 1,000 tons a week, could at best reduce the additional quantity required to 40,000 tons a week. The railway stocks, too, are low. down[30244] &apos; B 2
to 12 days&apos; consumption. To increase this reserve to 15 days will require 150,000tons extra by the 31st October, and to increase it to 21 days, which the Ministry ofWar Transport regard as necessary for safety, would require an extra 400,000tons over present supplies.13. So far there are no reliable indications of the effect of the reduction in munitions production on coal consumption in industry generally. Prima faciethere should be a definite economy, but, on the other hand, the munitions produc-tion in the United Kingdom has to a very large extent been met by the suspension of peace-time production, the resumption of which is increasingly necessary as time passes. Moreover, industries have been starved in quantity and have had toaccept lower grades of coal than the plant was designed to use. These factors willprobably neutralise any economies which&quot; might arise from a reduction in the munitions demands for coal.14. There remains the possibility of conversion to oil. A certain number of plants were forced to abandon the use of oil because of the supply difficulty. Itis probable that some reductions in coal consumption are possible by reversion tooil, or where dual firing is installed, by changing to oil. Although there is likelyto be a world shortage of oil whilst the Japanese war continues, on the basis of current demands the shortage is not likely to be so serious as the coal shortagenow is. It is doubtful, however, whether in the critical few months ahead anymore substantial contribution could be made in this direction in the UnitedKingdom than on the Continent : and there is no doubt a much wider field in theUnited States. On present estimates of world oil supplies any substantial diver-sion of supplies directly or indirectly for the release of coal for liberated europe would probably convert a manageable oil deficit into one which would seriouslyimpede operations in the Far East.15. The answer to each of the three questions in paragraph 10 above istherefore &quot; no.&quot;   The broad conclusions are that (a) the production of coal in the United Kingdom is no longer sufficient topermit of the export of any coal usable in the United Kingdom;(b) the export of coal so far sent or authorised to North-West Europe andthe Mediterranean has, in this Coal Year, been at the expense of stocks, with the result that the latter are dangerously low;(c) except for very low grades there will be no coal available after Septemberfor export : and not enough for the extra bunkering demands, unlessreductions are imposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government uponindustry, public services or domestic consumption.The European Situation.16. The fact that the United Kingdom cannot continue to export coal to europe without sacrifice of industrial production, which incidentally would reduce her capacity for helping liberated areas, or of domestic needs to an extent that would be embarrassing to any Government, does not absolve His Majesty&apos;sGovernment from further concern, in the above situation in North-West Europeor Italy. While S.H.A.E.F. and S.E.C.M.E.D. were controlling the imports into europe, the United States and United Kingdom undertook to see that essential needs were met. Those needs, however, grew with liberation and even preventionof disease and unrest is found to be absolutely dependent upon coal supplies.The needs up to 30th April, 1946, would be nearly 100 million tons if thedifference between expected local output and the 1938 consumption were the target, and are as low as the 30 million tons assumed by the Potter-HyndleyMission only because no higher target than about 50 per cent, of the 1938 con-sumption rate appeared practical. Supplies from Western Germany will take some months to reach the level necessary to meet needs, and the average rate of export will have to be about half a million tons a week from mid-August to meetminimum requirements. Such a rate is not impossible, but it is extremely doubtfulwhether such a quantity could be moved in time even if the effort to restoretransportation were comparable with that made for the preparation for D-day.In the period between now and November, if serious unrest is to be avoided inEurope, some means must be found to fill up the gap between what can be found from German and the local deficiencies in supplies.17. The United States Government can reasonably be asked to send as quickly as possible their share of the 5,000,000 tons and to&apos;continue the bunkeringarrangements at the rate of 90,000 tons a month.   In view of our difficulties and
of the extra bunkering involved in the release of Baltic shipping, it would be reasonable to ask them to waive any obligation on ,us to send an equal quantity oflarge coal to Europe after August.The United States Government might be persuaded to make a greater comtribution, but in view of the amount involved, it would be out of the question for them to accept liability for the full residual deficit. It is important to convince them that the United Kingdom will have no more coal available afterSeptember, and that we have no undisclosed safety reserve of coal. If, however,they were able to increase their supplies, such an increase could not fill the gap,for apart from supply difficulties, which are known to be serious, every million tons of coal will require not less than 125 liberty cargoes and possibly 150.18. The difficulties of any substantial supplies and the impossibility of adequate supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States, combined with the unavoidable delay in increasing the output and transportation of coal from Western Germany, suggests that in the interest of Europe stability and recovery and out of consideration for the desperate plight of the peoples irrespective of any consideration clue to the Government concerned aid shouldbe sought from the coal resources of Poland and Silesia, by direct export to the liberated territories and by bunkering in the Baltic. Such aid can be obtainedonly by a joint approach by the President and the Prime Minister at the Three-Power Conference. The necessity for this step is emphasised by the latest information regarding the output and the internal needs of Western Germany.On latest information it appears that the total quantity that can be produced will fall far short of the quantity required to meet vital internal needs and to permit the export of 25 million tons by 30th April, 1946, which was the target suggestedby the Potter-Hyndley Mission.Conclusions.19. In order that the shipping now available from the Baltic may bemaintained in service and in particular utilised for bringing to the UnitedKingdom timber and other commodities vital to our building programme and our whole economy, it is necessary that the ships should be supplied with bunker coal.It is politically and economically essential that this opportunity of importingtimber should be seized now so that substantial shipments can be made beforethe Baltic is ice-bound. But we have no coal available for bunkering these shipswithout infringing our essential requirements. We have reached bedrock in thecoal position in the United Kingdom.Gas supplies cannot be assured without extra stocks for the winter, and therailway stocks are below the safety line for continued running at the present level. Reductions cannot be made in industrial consumption without a directdiminution of essential production and the war effort, nor in domestic supplies or public utilities without risk of serious trouble in the winter months.We accordingly recommend that : (a) The supplies of bunker coal (amounting to about 90,000 tons a month)from the United States, which were agreed to enable the UnitedKingdom to export an equivalent amount of large coal to North-west europe, should continue although the United Kingdom will no longer be able to send any such coal to Europe after August.(b) Every effort should be made to obtain some supplies of coal from poland and Silesia in order to relieve the Western European situation andto provide bunker coal for ships using Scandinavian and Baltic ports.(a) Requires the agreement of the Americans.(b) Requires the agreement of the Russians to whom a joint Anglo-Americanapproach would have to be made.We therefore suggest that these two issues be raised at Terminal and that ifthis procedure is approved, the combined Coal Committee be immediatelyinformed.18th July, 1945.30244] B 3
ANNEX II.Coal : Increased Bunkering Requirements (CP. 45 (60) and 45 (66)).1. The best estimate that Ministry of War Transport can make of their requirements for foreign bunkers during the coal year 1945-46 is that they will represent, at most, an average 100,000 tons per month increase over actual takingsduring the coal year 1944-45. The total requirements will, therefore, amount toabout 3 million tons. The increase arises in part from released Scandinavianshipping and German prize ships and in part from increased requirefnents ofBritish-controlled ships.2. Ministry of War Transport have indicated that some lowering of quality of bunker coal as compared with war-time standards is now possible. Detailsof the minimum standards now acceptable are set out in Annex III. Briefly, for ships on the short North Sea routes (estimated requirement 750,000 to 1,000,000tons per annum) coals not inferior to Humber half-and-half mixture can beaccepted. For other ships (estimated requirement 2 to 2-25 million tons perannum) coals not inferior to Humber thirds mixture can be accepted.3. In 1944-45 the tonnage taken in foreign bunkers was divided asfollows : Large       ...............      1,450,766UnscreenedGradedWashed SmallsMiscellaneous287,316156.2076,09211,1091,911,4904. Assuming that in 1945-46 demand was distributed between supplyingdistricts in the same proportion as in 1944-45 and that the minimum qualitywere accepted and could be made available in each district, requirements wouldbe approximately (see Annex IV) 1945-46 Increase or decrease on 1944-45Large      ........ 960.000 -491.000Unscreened....... 1.140,000 4- 853,000Graded    ......-     ... 217,500 4 61,000Washed Smalls...... 652,500 4-648,000Miscellaneous     ...... 30,000 4 19,0005. This shows an apparent saving of nearly half a million tons of large coal. It should be noted, however, that of this saving, 400,000 tons would bein Durham and 35,000 tons in Scotland. On the other hand, the unscreeneddemand would increase by 650.000 tons in Durham and just over 200,000 tons inScotland.6. The Durham unscreened coal would have to be withdrawn from gasworks;for reasons given later, in this note, this would be impossible. The bulk (some75 per cent.) of the total Scottish production of all qualities of unscreened coalis already going either to foreign, coastwise or trawler bunkers or to gasworks.It would&quot; not, therefore, be possible materially to increase the availability of scottish unscreened coal for foreign bunkers.7. The apparent saving of large coal is, therefore, largely illusory, unless a substantial withdrawal of supplies from gasworks could be contemplated.8. The increased demand for graded coal in the Tlumber could only bs met by the Midland (Amalgamated) District by withdrawals from the gasworks.9. The increased demands for washed smalls in the Humber and SouthWales could only be met by withdrawals from the coke ovens. In South Wales,throughput at the coke ovens is already restricted slightly, while the Midland(Amalgamated) District and Durham coke oven throughput is only just being-maintained. Apart from coke requirements, it should be remembered that74 per cent, of coke oven coal consumption is at plants supplying gas to publicsupplies, and another 15 per cent, at plants supplying gas to steelworks; another2 per cent, is used by Imperial Chemical Industries at a high priority plant.
The remaining 9 per cent, (about 40,000 tons per week) is used at plants connectedwith collieries, where a reduction in throughput is difficult, if not impossibleof achievement without effect on coal production. Any reduction in throughputat coke ovens would, therefore, affect the country&apos;s gas supplies directly.10. The increased coal required for bunkers could thus only be, found atthe expense of supplies to the country&apos;s gas-making plants (gasworks and coke ovens).11. But, so far from it being possible to reduce supplies for this purpose,they require to be increased. On the present rate of supply, gasworks in Englandand Wales will reach an average stock of just over 3 winter weeks&apos; supply at the31st October next. Over recent winters the amount withdrawn from stockaveraged about 2\ weeks&apos; supply (1942-43: 1-8 weeks; 1943-44: 1-8 weeks;1944-45 : 3-9 weeks). The lowest average stock figure for the end of the winterwhich could be regarded as even reasonably safe would be 2 weeks, and this wouldbe lower than ever before. It would, therefore, be fatal, to start the winter with less than 4^ weeks&apos; supply, and anything below 5 weeks&apos; would be dangerous. to achieve 5 weeks&apos; stocks by the 31st October, supplies require to be increased overpresent levels by upwards of 70,000 tons a week. (Gas consumption is running at about 4-7 per cent, above last year.)12. It is possible that, in the near future, some 15,000 tons a week may become available, mainly from new opencast operations; Some 3,500 tons perweek may be found by withdrawals from industry that can be effected withoutprejudice to industrial production. Production of water gas has already been increased by 13 per cent, over last year (thus averting a demand for some7,000 tons of coal per week), and it may be possible to increase it by another1 per cent, or 2 per cent, (thus saving another 1,000 tons per week). After taking account of all these possibilities, it is still essential to find 40-45,000 tons perweek for the gasworks.13. The possibility of effecting further economies in gas consumption isbeing examined, but it would be unwise to assume any substantial contributionto the problem from this source.14. A reduction in house-coal supplies, to release large coal suitable forgasworks, railways or bunkers, cannot be contemplated. Disposals to the house-coal market in 1945-46 are not likely materially to exceed 31 million tons,compared with over 33^ million in 1944-45 (and about 46 million in peace-time).Distribution of house-coal during the winter is likely in any case to be prejudiced by labour shortage, and would be further aggravated by inadequate stocks.15. Industry is a small consumer of large coal, but a substantial consumerof high quality graded coal suitable for gas making. At the present level ofindustrial production, however, industrial supplies have been downgraded in quality virtually to the minimum (the further possibilities in this direction havebeen taken into account in paragraph 12). Forecasts based on the forward trend of labour distribution in industry suggest that no material change in the level ofindustrial consumption can be expected for some time to come, though pressureis already being experienced from industrial consumers for an improvement in quality.16. It would, therefore, be impracticable to withdraw coal from industry for the gasworks without substantial interference with industrial productionnext winter. The possibility of substituting liquid fuel for coal in industry hasbeen considered, but Ministry of Fuel and Power advise that the shortage of fuel oil is so serious that no new demands can be considered, while creosote pitchsuppliers are barely adequate to meet current requirements.17. Attention must also be directed to the railway coal supply position.Consumption is running slightly higher than last year. Stocks&apos; stand at-7 winter weeks&apos; supply. They will fall slightly in the&apos;immediate future; theymay recover to 1-7 weeks by the 31st October, but will certainly not be more.Ministry of War Transport have expressed the view that they should be at-0 weeks by that date. To achieve 3-0 weeks supplies would need to be increasedby about 400,000 tons between now and the 31st October. Ministry of Fuel and power feel that the railways might manage with 2-2 weeks, which would require an increased supply of about 150,000 tons by the 31st October.
18.   Summary -(a) The increased demand for bunker coal is of the order of 100,000 tons per month; the large coal involved in this could only be saved at theexpense of coals directly or indirectly required to maintain gassupplies.(5) To safeguard the gas supply position next winter, supplies of coal togasworks should be increased by about 40-45,000 tons per week overand above the increases already being arranged. Any materialincrease in water-gas is not practicable.(c) Railway coal supplies require to be increased by about 150,000 tons (onM.F.P. view) or 400,000 tons (on M.W.T. view) between now and the31st October.(d) These additional requirements cannot be met by diverting housecoalsupplies.(e) To withdraw coal from the Industrial market for any of these purposeswould prejudice industrial production next winter. The extent and direction of this prejudice are being studied further.In effect, therefore, there are two interlocking problems. There is not enoughlarge coal to meet the demands of railways and bunkers; nor enough gas coal tomeet the demand of gasworks and industry. Either can be solved only at theexpense of making the other worse.19.   Recommendations-(a) M.F.P. have already offered to try and make available to North-west europe an additional 50-100,000 tons of low quality coals per month.This should be confirmed, and the United States pressed to continuethe bunker switch as on ton-for-ton basis, in spite of the fact that thequalities will not be comparable.(&amp;) The United Kingdom should cease supplying large coal and gas coal to North-West Europe at the end of August.The deficits set out in paragraph 18 total approximately 320,000 tons per month over the next three months (or 400,000 tons per month if the M.W.T. view on railway stocks is accepted). The two measures at (a) and (b) above wouldmake available about 100,000 tons per month of large coal (mainly) and gascoal towards meeting them.ANNEX III.Minimum Types of Coal acceptable as Bunkers.Area of Supply.A.
