DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 62.5th Jidy, 1945.CABINET.MAN-POWER.Note by the Prime Minister.WOMEN ought not to be treated the same as men. The reason why we donot bring home the men we want to get the industries started is because of theanger it would cause among Class A. Class A stands first and super-sacred. Anyinfringement upon their rights might cause the gravest disaster, as it did lasttime.   We must carry them with us at all costs.2. But women are an entirely different category. They do not mutiny or cause disturbances, and the sooner they are back at their homes the better. this idea of keeping masses of highly-paid young women hanging around at the AirForce stations and in Army and Navy work, with a redundant staff finding ajob in teaching them to lead a better life, is one which should be completely cutout of our system. All women should be free to retire as soon as possible fromthe Services, and those who like to stay will be found sufficient to do the necessaryjobs. A regular ramp is growing up to hold on to these women. No one who isnot absolutely necessary to the war effort can in any circumstances be retained.Any who are to go to the Ear F2ast or India must volunteer from those who wishto continue in the Services. I trust within a few weeks we may be able to declare that every woman who wishes to leave the Services may do so provided the numberswho wish to leave are not so great as to affect the rate of release of Class A.3.   Pray let all efforts be made to realise this objective.W. S. C,10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,5th July, 1945.
