Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1945.CP. (45) 55.2nd July, 1945.CABINET.IMPERIAL SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.Note by the Secretary.THE annexed memorandum by the Minister Resident in the Middle Easthas been considered and approved by the Middle East Defence Committee.2. By direction of the Prime Minister, it is now circulated for the considera-tion of the Cabinet.3. In forwarding it, the Minister Resident in the Middle East asks that special attention should be directed to paragraphs 31-36 on our relations withI^UctHCG(Signed)      E. E. BRIDGES.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd July, 1945.MEMORANDUM.This is a political memorandum. Its purpose is to discuss the following subjects from the standpoint of Imperial security in the Middle East: (a) the nature of British interests and aims in the Middle East;(b) the most promising political method of dealing with the Middle EasternStates;(c) the varying importance to us of those States;(d) the attitude to be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards other powers in the Middle East.2. The memorandum also contains some tentative ideas upon the Naval,Military and Air dispositions which seem best fitted to maintain security withinthe political and financial conditions which are likely to govern us. These ideas,I need hardly say, are purely for discussion; I count upon my Service colleagues in the Defence Committee to criticise them with the utmost freedom from theirseveral points of view. But one principle of action I am concerned to emphasise,namely, that our defence arrangements must be closely allied both to our politicalaims and to the political situation in the Middle East if they are to be effective in protecting our vital interests, because we are now entering&apos; an era in whichpolitical considerations will infallibly predominate. 1* do not mean by this that policy in the form of guarantees of security should not be closely governed by our military capacity to honour the obligations which we undertake. Nor do I mean that the effectiveness of our policy will not very greatly depend upon the strength which we are able to deploy in case of need, as also upon the knowledge among the[30116] ^      b
peoples concerned that the strength and the organisation for deploying it willbe ready at call when the need arises. Security cannot be ensured by statesmanshipand diplomacy alone; it must also be based on strength. What I mean is that weshall not be able in peace to ride roughshod over political considerations as wehave done at necessity in war, and that, accordingly, no system of security will prove adequate which is not wisely fitted to the political conditions and characterof the Middle Eastern States.Our Vital Interests in the Middle East.3. The British Empire, in contrast to the self-contained land-masses of theAmerican and Soviet Unions, is a co-operative commonwealth of widely separatedpeoples; and the resources necessary to its existence are as widely scattered asthe peoples themselves. Its life and strength therefore depend upon the freedomof its communications; it could not survive as a co-operative system, nor could most of its individual peoples escape subservience to some foreign rule, if itscommunications were effectively dominated and liable to severance by some foreign power. In the nineteenth century Britain&apos;s naval predominance was sufficient to guarantee the safety of the whole. In the second half of the twentieth centuryBritain, though still immensely powerful, would not be the equal of the Americanor Soviet Unions if she ever stood alone. Even the British Empire as a wholemust have powerful Allies; but its coherence must be Britain&apos;s first concernbecause her status and influence depend upon the fact that she is the parent State,and still the strongest State, in a family of peoples who broadly support herpolicies and believe that the Empire is as essential to their freedom and welfareas to hers. Egypt and the Levant have long been of great strategic importanceto the British Empire, as witness Napoleon&apos;s attempt to seize them early in hiscareer; but the cutting of the Suez Canal, the development of the air arm andof air communications, and the vital necessity of controlling adequate suppliesof mineral oil for lubrication and motive power have made all the communications which run through the Middle East, together with the oilfields in Iraq and southern Persia, absolutely indispensable to its cohesion and security. It resultsthat the whole region of the Middle East is now an essential link in the Imperialsystem, a centre in which are gathered essential arteries of communication and anessential source of power.4. The Middle East is therefore a region of life-and-death consequence for britain and the British Empire in four ways : (a) as an indispensable channel of communications between the Empire&apos;sWestern, Eastern and Southern territories;(b) as a strategic centre, control of which would enable an enemy to disruptand destroy a considerable part of the British Imperial system andto deprive Britain herself of many supports and resources essential toher status and influence as a major Power;(c) as the Empire&apos;s main reservoir of mineral oil;id) as a region in which British political method must make good, if theBritish way of life is to survive.The vital importance of those four considerations has been established byhard experience in both world wars.Our Aims in the Middle East.5. The island of Cyprus, lying just West of the Fertile Crescent, is theonly territory in this region over which we hold full sovereignty. Palestine isa mandated territory, and its future is subject in some considerable measure to international agreement. All the other Middle Eastern countries are independent states except Transjordan, whose independence will very soon be equally complete,and the two Levant States, whose position vis-a-vis France is still precarious.We have, therefore, to face the fact that protection of our vital interests in theMiddle East will depend upon the collaboration which we can obtain in severalindependent States and one Mandated State. Neither the American nor theSoviet Union can be said to depend in this manner upon its relations with a group of independent States far from its own boundaries; and neither certainly hasan interest comparable to ours in close relations with the group which constitutes the Middle East. Neither, therefore, will sacrifice anything essential to itsstanding as a Great Power by entrusting the main responsibility for peace and security in the Middle East to Britain, whereas Britain would be seen and knownto have sacrificed a position vital to her strength if she surrendered that
responsibility to any other Power. I assume accordingly that Britain&apos;s claims tobe recognised as the major Power most deeply concerned in the regional securityof the Middle East will be acknowledged by the World Security Council and theUnited Nations when the organisation of world security against war is beingworked out.6. Even so, the task before us in the Middle East is unusual and most diffi-cult. We cannot expect the sensitive young nationalist movements of the middle east to accept direction and control from us merely because it is necessary to us.We must persuade them that their major interests and ours coincide, and we must seek to give them the guidance and co-operation they need in the form which willbe most acceptable to them. The difficulty of all this has been very largely overlaidduring the last five years. Non-co-operation has on occasion lifted an ugly head,but in the main ready co-operation has been the rule. During the war we haveenjoyed an unlimited range of facilities under our treaties with Egypt and Iraq.We have used our mandatory position in Palestine and our semi-mandatoryposition in Transjordan for war purposes without stint or check. We have entered the two Levant States and secured from them a practically unlimited com-plaisance towards our military convenience as well as our military necessities.We are established in various enemy territories whose future international statusis still to be defined. British officers and other ranks are admirable ambassadors.They have eased our relations with the local peoples in many important ways andcreated an atmosphere of friendliness towards us throughout the Middle East.This friendliness is a very important element; it spreads an absolutely invaluableaura about the immense prestige which the record of the Empire in the war hasrestored to us.. But it cannot be taken for granted. Arab and Egyptian senti-ment is notoriously changeable; unwise action, inconsiderate policy, can transformit (as Sir Kinahan Cornwallis has often observed) almost overnight.7. War has now passed completely from the Middle East, though this regionis still an essential base; and we have to deal with States which have forgotten the necessities of war and are wholly concentrated upon their national rights asearnest of all they hope to achieve in peace. To finish the Far Eastern war withdespatch, we must prolong in almost all essentials our military occupation of theMiddle East. But it is imperative to realise that the manner in which we acquitourselves during this last stage of war and the transition from war to peace willprofoundly affect our future relations with the Arab States. We must ride themwith the loosest possible rein asking rather for co-operation than insisting uponrights, unless compelled to do so, humouring their national sensitiveness in every possible way, caring for their essential interests, and remembering that Imperialsecurity in the future will depend in no small degree upon the skill and tact withwhich we now discharge a very exacting and complex task.8. Our governing aim in the Middle East should therefore be, not to dominate its peoples or dictate how they shall live, but to preserve them against any other domination, to help them to help themselves towards political stabilityancl social advance, to make them feel that their interests coincide with ours, andthus to secure the fullest possible measure of co-operation from them in matters ofpolicy and in arrangements for defence. The most important factors in achievingthat aim will be ; (a) Friendship with Middle Eastern Rulers and Governments.(b) Security against sedition and widespread popular discontent.(c) Security against external propaganda designed to cause unrest.The Middle Eastern States are socially unbalanced and primitive; they all exhibit,in varying degrees, a dangerous contrast between poverty and wealth. Thegreatest risk to security in the nearer future will be political and social discontent.This will indubitably be exploited by Soviet propaganda (and with some reason)if it is not providently guarded against by a policy of steady reform andbetterment.9. The main essentials will be close attention to the trappings of nationalindependence (the outer form will always matter more than the inner method inthis part of the East), and the use of all the influence we can exert to secure pro-gressive policies in questions of land tenure, employment, justice, education,poverty and health. Sedition in this region, though it spring from poverty andmisrule, is certain, like Arabfs rebellion, to take an anti-foreign and therefore[30116] b 2
anti-British bent when once it breaks out. There is already in existence muchfanaticism which attributes the evils of Middle Eastern society solely to foreignexploitation and self-interest. We shall therefore not be able to exert the necessaryinfluence unless we handle the problems of transition from universal to Far Easternwar and from that to final peace with great consideration, and unless we keep the friendship and secure the co-operation of Rulers and Governments. We com-pletely misunderstood the situation after the last war, and. have suffered much inconsequence. If we fail again, the Soviet Union will assuredly inherit theinfluence which we shall have lost. That, for the next twenty years at least, willbe the main danger from the side of Russia in the Middle East. She will always be ready (her evangel demands it) to exploit the wickedness of &quot; WesternImperialism.&quot; if we do not see that genuine progress is made towards a better stateof society than at present exists.10. Policy is not enough of course by itself. It must be based on strength.But we could never afford to maintain the strength which would be necessary toprotect our vital interests, if our political aim and method failed to secure the goodwill and co-operation of the Middle Eastern States. The character of iheEmpire is, moreover, its greatest asset by comparison with the elemental power ofthe only major State which may seriously challenge its position in the Middle Ease.We must prove and justify that character to the full in the Middle East, if theEmpire is to continue to exist.Importance of the Various States.11. Certain other political observations fall to be made before any attemptto assess the importance, from the standpoint of Imperial security, of theindividual Middle Eastern States.12. Though we shall, I should like to insist, be acknowledged as the majorPower responsible for peace and security in this region, we shall not be able to afford any vagueness or imprecision in the measures of co-operation which weshall require of the various States. Naval and air bases, cantonments and trainingareas, the protection of oilfields, pipe-lines, terminal ports and essentialcommunications by water and land are not matters which can be left to chance ordealt with solely on the line of least political resistance without regard to theclaims of effective defence. We shall have to obtain the lease of essential bases and the grant of other facilities by treaty or perhaps better still by a pact of mutual defence negotiated as part of the new world order with individual States.We shall be entitled to obtain all this and strengthened in the process of obtainingit, by the fact that we shall be the major Power chiefly responsible to the world security organisation for the&apos;peace of the Middle East; but we should also aim at the establishment of a genuinely co-operative scheme of defence, the local Statescontributing all they can in such a way as to complement our own forces andagreeing to the regular arrangement of joint exercises between our forces andtheirs. It is also to be hoped that equipment will be broadly the same throughoutthe area, so that joint training may be facilitated and supply problems simplifiedin time of need.13. While, moreover, the general scheme of defence, particularly as regardsthe air, must be organised in the greatest possible depth so that we command sofar as practicable the coast lines flanking our sea routes and the areas outsidethe region itself whence air attack upon it may most effectively be launched, thereare certain areas of exceptional importance and also certain vulnerable pointswithin the region which necessitate especially clear and solid understanding withcertain Middle Eastern States.   These are (a) the area of the Suez Canal and the terminal ports;(b) the main naval base in the Eastern Mediterranean at Alexandria;(c) the pipe-line from Northern Iraq to Haifa and the port and installationsat Haifa itself;id) the oilfields in Iraq and Southern Persia;(e) the port and installations at Abadan;(/) the whole line of communication by land and air running from theMediterranean sea-board through Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq tothe Persian Gulf.It will be manifest from this short list that Egypt, Palestine, Transjordan and iraq must be the central factors in our scheme of defence. The security of theAustrian Empire in Italy used to be based upon a scheme of defence embracing
four mutually supporting cities, and this central strategic area was known asthe Quadrilateral. Egypt, Palestine, Trans Jordan and Iraq do not form aQuadrilateral but rather a strategic spine in which all four are essential vertebrae.We cannot afford to lose our position in any one of them or even to see it seriouslyweakened.   They support and depend on each other.14. One other consideration requires emphasis. There is no doubt thatafter the war the Arab States will be extremely averse to the presence of foreigngarrisons in their territory, more especially in or near great centres of populationwhere their presence is necessarily prominent. The only exception is Transjordan,where the Amir Abdullah and his people are unlikely, I am told, to object in anyway to the grant of cantonments and training areas, provided the co-operationof Transjordan troops is welcomed in joint exercises and the present greatfriendliness of our relations is not disturbed. In other Arab States, not leastEgypt and Iraq, we shall, I believe, be wise to reduce our demands for permanentlylocated troops to a minimum. The great measure of co-operation and the baseswhich we shall need in those States will be much easier to obtain if we use ourcommand of the air to keep our main forces out of sight. Provided we have theessential oases, adequately protected and duly equipped, we shall be able to count upon regular exercises with air squadrons, air-borne troops and (where convenient)truck-borne troops from outside to show that the strength which is necessary to security exists. The more such exercises can be organised as joint exercises with local troops and air forces, the more popular will they be and the stronger willbe our scheme of combined regional defence. It follows from this method, if adopted, that Palestine will be of exceptional importance as the only territory(apart from Cyprus) where the administration is in our hands and where ourfacilities will be unlimited in time of peace.15.   To these general observations I w^ould add a few notes, as concisely aspossible, upon the individual States.Cyprus.16.   I begin with Cyprus because (apart from Aden, which is not wellsituated to serve the main purpose here in view) it is the only territory completelyunder British sovereignty in the Middle East.   Our hold upon the people of cyprus is not as sure as&apos; it should be in view of the important part which the island must play in our Middle Eastern system of security.   The sentimentaldesire of the great majority of the Greek population (four-fifths of the whole)for union with Greece, which has always been strong, is gathering new strengthfrom two factors the wind of national and racial self-consciousness which isfanning such movements everywhere and the dislike of being governed byforeigners, which is blowing equally hard in most parts of the world.   We canonly answer that Greece is not strong enough to guarantee the independence of cyprus and that, if we ceased to guarantee it, the island would soon be dominated by another great Power.   It always has been and always will be so dominateduntil the lion lies down with the lamb.   But this is not a convincing answer toa delightful people with an immense capacity for political argument but no experience of self-government.   Cyprus will not be a reliable member of ourMiddle Eastern security system unless we can persuade her that she is more likelyto find safety and attain self-government within that system than in any otherthat is open to her.   The material development of the island is making consider-able strides with generous help from the Colonial Development Fund, but weshall not retain the loyalty of the island by material benefactions of that characteralone.  Two other things are essential to show that we can give it security, andto associate its people as fully as possible not only with our plans of developmentbut also, I am convinced, with our scheme of defence.   There are no betterexamples of British character nor interpreters of the British point of view than british Service men.   It is, moreover, by genuine co-operation in defence and byserving with British officers and men that the inferiority complex in our smallerpartners (which largely inspires their nationalism) can best be cured.   It is ofgreat importance that a declaration of our intentions in Cyprus should be made without delay, since the Union-with-Greece movement is very strong and is being-exploited by the local Communists for their own ends.   Silence of a negativecharacter will not stem1 the movement or prevent it from causing disturbanceswhich, like those in Greece, will probably find sympathy in America, even thoughthe only gainer by weakness or surrender on our part would be a third great Power.
17. I had hoped that Cyprus might be developed as the main Fleet base in the Eastern Mediterranean, where such a base is assuredly required. the harbour at Famagusta will have in any case to be greatly improved for civil purposes, if the projects in prospect under the Colonial Development Fund areto mature. I understand now that Alexandria is to be preferred to Cyprus asthe main Fleet base in this region, because the island, though valuable as an advanced air base, is so sited as to make adequate defence against air attack from the north impossible. The establishment of a small naval base, which is, Ibelieve, considered desirable, and of an advanced air-base would, however, do much for the island and strengthen our hold upon its people, especially if Britishtroops were also located there&quot; In the case of internal unrest in the Middle Eastit would be a valuable small base on British territory for all forces.Egypt.18. We have a hard and searching task before us in Egypt. The pashas and land-owners have accumulated prodigious fortunes in this war. Few have anygenuine public spirit, and they are practically untaxed because they control allpossible elected governments. The student intelligentsia is always in a state ofsuppressed ferment; it is growing rapidly and somehow or other will have to beemployed. The rank and file of the Army and Police are badly paid. Thefellahin (apart from those who are working for wages under us) are far worse off than before the war. Nationalist sentiment is intense. Xenophobia is alwaysseething below the surface. Trouble is bound to take a violently anti-Britishturn if living conditions deteriorate and grievances multiply in the process ofdemobilisation, as they may only too easily do. But for the admirable conductand habitual good temper of British troops, it would have broken out ere now for Cairo still looks like an occupied city with camps all round it and in someof its parks.19. It will be extremely hard to negotiate a satisfactory new treaty in theconditions which are likely to prevail; for there is no part of the Middle Eastin which our influence will depend so much upon our success in helping the localruler to make progress in such vital matters as employment, land-tenure, educa-tion and health, and in tackling the people&quot;s awful poverty. For a long time weshall be the potential butt of nationalism and xenophobia because of our longand close association with the country, and a very little unwisdom on our part would make our standing extremely precarious. In these conditions the followingseems to me the best we can do from the defence point of view : (a) to offer to evacuate Cairo at the earliest possible date, provided facilities(b), (c), (d) and (e) are conceded to us;(b) all the facilities necessary to establish and keep in readiness a mainFleet base at Alexandria;(c) cantonments and training facilities on the Great Bitter Lake in additionto the forces and facilities necessary (see despatch on Suez Canal)for the defence of the Canal Zone;(d) a leased area and an agreed co-operative scheme of air defence andtraining to be worked out between the Air Forces of the two countries;(e) continuance of the undertaking to afford us all the facilities we may require in time of emergency or of actual war.The Ambassador emphasises (and I fully concur) that it may be particularly difficult to secure the necessary facilities for a main naval base at Alexandriain time of peace. The arguments for it are strong, since there is no alternativeequally removed from possible air attack from the north and most of the necessaryexpenditure has already been incurred. It is to be remembered, moreover, thatAlexandria is in full working order, whereas a new main base would not beavailable for some years owing to the work requiring to be done and the probableshortage of skilled engineering staff. It may be necessary, therefore, to press our need of Alexandria despite any political difficulties which the proposal may create.But the difficulties are likely to be grave, and they should not be overlooked.Palestine.20. The conception of a security system with the Canal, Palestine,Transjordan and Iraq for its central vertebrae is incompatible with the partition of Palestine. I cannot indeed see how any conceivable system of British security in the Middle East can be reconciled with the partition of Palestine.   The worst
political feature of partition, namely its alienation of the whole Arab world, isalmost equalled by its military defects, which are the alienation of the Palestinecoast, the dependance upon treaty rights for the defence of Haifa and the pipe-line, and the reduction of British tenure to a land-bound Jerusalem State possessed of highly controversial frontiers and surrounded on all sides by uncertain friendsif not by positive enemies. It is indispensable to Imperial security in the middle east, as also for the discharge of our responsibilities in this region to the new world Order, that Palestine should be administered by Britain as an undividedwhole. It is equally indispensable that there should be no armed forces in it* but those which the British administration controls. It is only so that com-munications can be controlled, troops disposed as may be necessary, airfieldsmaintained, Haifa and the pipe-line adequately secured, and inter-racial frictionreduced to a minimum. Palestine and Transjordan must constitute the core ofour Middle Eastern system of security. To disrupt that core by creating anindependent State upon the Palestine sea-board and alienating Transjordanwould be to undermine our whole Middle Eastern position. Egypt and Iraq will certainly be difficult from time to time in the future as in the past, but palestine and Transjordan will be reliable buttresses in all weathers, provided weadminister the former and cement the loyal friendship shown us by Ruler and people alike in the latter when no other free and uninvaded State in the worldwas making war in common with us and our fortunes were at their lowest. TheMiddle Eastern Defence Committee is unanimous in the opinion that the partition of Palestine would, from the military standpoint, spell irremediable disaster.Transjordan.21. Transjordan has been throughout the war the most friendly and helpfulof the Arab States. The Arab Legion fought for us in our darkest hours againstother Arab forces and is a model, with its admixture of British and local officersserving above or under each other without distinction of race, of what may bedone with Arab man-power, provided only the best British officers are posted to it and the right method pursued. Her loyalty is vital to us, for her territory^lies on the central spine between Palestine and Iraq and also marches withSyria. But for the loyalty of Transjordan we should, for instance, have hadto face a steady infiltration into Palestine of Arab bands from Syria, SaudiArabia and Iraq coming to support the rebellion which broke out in 1936. Inthe future the friendship of Transjordan will be even more valuable, if we areto complete our trust in Palestine with success and keep the peace of the middle east. It is noteworthy that the present Prime Minister of Transjordan wasborn and raised in Palestine, as also was his predecessor in that post bothloyal friends of Britain and competent for their work. It may well be that someof the Arab leaders which Palestine requires may be drawn from Transjordanin the years immediately ahead; and it will depend upon our relations withTransjordan whether or not they help us in the task of building up in Palestinea peaceable bi-racial State. I am convinced that the development of even closermilitary co-operation with that territory and careful attention to the militarymodel of the Transjordan Arab Legion, which has proved its worth, may do much to strengthen our political ties with the Amir and his people and therebyto reinforce our central bastion in the Middle East.Iraq.22. The friendship of Iraq cannot bs guaranteed, but if we pursue theline of policy established by Sir Kinahan Cornwallis in the last four years, avoid the mortal offence of subordinating Syria to French ambition or Palestine, toZionism, maintain our cordial relations with the Hashimite family, and sendher really good men, her friendship ought not to be difficult to retain. (Second-raters are instantly detected in every part of the Middle East and reduce ourstanding immeasurably.) It should not, however, be necessaiy to station large forces in Iraq if a scheme of combined defence with regular joint exercises is organised, and the movement of forces from Transjordan and Palestine in caseof emergency is carefully provided for. The three vital areas in Iraq are the oilfields in the North and the area of Habbaniya towards the South and Shibafrom which the South Persian oilfields and Abadan wrould have to be defended.In these areas leased bases should be obtained, if possible.
The Levant States.23. In view of the certainty that neither of the Levant States will grantFrance bases or other military facilities and of the fact that we have imposedupon ourselves a self-denying ordinance in France&apos;s favour, it is necessary torecognise that Syria and the Lebanon will constitute something in the nature ofmilitary vacuum. The future of the republican institutions which both have adopted is problematic, since monarchy is the traditional centre of stability inthese still primitive and semi-settled parts; and it is also doubtful whether the lebanon will be able to make good as a separate State. It may be desirable mat a later date to bring them more closely into the defence scheme of the middle east, particularly if (as seems possible) the Americans put new oil installationsat Tripoli, bring a new pipe-line to it, and develop it as a terminal port. Butthe States are anxious to play their part as members of the world security order and also of the Arab League, and they may be counted upon to grant the necessary facilities for Middle Eastern defence in that guise, whether or not their presentconfiguration as separate States and their present systems of Government survive.Russian propaganda is making itself felt in the towns, and the French have encouraged it blindly as an offset to British influence. Turkey is determined.not to relinquish the Hatay, and might take steps to increase her holding ifthe opportunity seemed inviting. It is even possible that she might be encouraged to do so by Russia as compensation for losses elsewhere, if Russia had madesure of her general subservience to Russian policy. Internal instability andthe conflict of rival Arab ambitions in the States themselves might well create the opportunity. It is therefore of serious importance that the States should not remain a debatable land exposed to strife between competing neighbours andsystems of Government, but should come into the co-operative system of middle eastern security set up by us as reasonably stable partners. The Hashimitefamily seems at present rather lacking in potential rulers of solid quality;but it is more deeply rooted in Arab tradition than any other. Its growing fearof Russia will always keep it pro-British, and I think we should unobtrusivelyfoster the traditional regard which is felt for it.Saudi Arabia.24. The power and influence &quot;which Saudi Arabia can exert in middle eastern affairs depends on a single factor, the prestige and masterful personalityof King Ibn Saud. This is now waning because of his great age, and it willvanish altogether when he dies. Saudi Arabia will then become another militaryvacuum. She sems likely to be rent by internal conflict, and a revival of Wahabifanaticism may cause some trouble on her frontiers. But these are domestictribulations against which her neighbours can protect themselves and are not likely to endanger in any way the broad security arrangements which we should base upon Egypt and the central spine of Middle Eastern defence Palestine,Transjordan, Iraq. American oil interests are deply concerned in the province of Nerd, which may well become a separate and affluent State. I shall be com-menting later upon our relations with America in the Middle East. It will suffice to say here that, so far as I can see, the greater the American interestin any part of the Middle East, the better for us.Concluding Points.   -25.   There are three concluding observations which I should like to add tothis very summary study of our relations with the Middle Eastern States.26. It will be seen, in the first place, that no attempt has been made in this paper to discuss the strength which we should maintain in the Middle Eastor the location of our forces. So far as the army is concerned, the latter is being studied by a Re-Deployment Committee, which will deal with purely military considerations. In Cyrenaica the Royal Air Force are understood to attach importance to the Hump east of Benghazi, and Tobruk may be equipped to serve as a small naval base and port. Air bases in Kenya and Rhodesia will also bedesirable.27. Secondly, I must make it clear that I have not attempted in thisrough study to deal with one over-riding consideration, namely, finance. Thequestion of what we can legitimately afford for defence in the Middle East is greatly complicated by such problems as the risk of local inflation and the size of the sterling debt, and lies entirely beyond my competence.   I can only say,
with deep conviction, that we cannot afford to be weak, and&apos; would therefore call attention to one measure which may assist to reduce considerably the high cost of defence.28. Military expenditure is most economically incurred where, so far aspossible, it will serve a double purpose and pay two separate dividends. Theuse of Kenya and Rhodesia as rear bases and of Cyprus as an advanced basewould conform to this principle. Other cases would be Palestine andTransjordan where grants-in-aid must, in any event, be made for development.Yet another is Cyrenaioa. I cannot see what British purpose a grant to Ethiopiawould serve comparable with any of these or others which I could enumerate.29. Thirdly and lastly, I would emphasise the importance of reducing to aminimum the visible permanent troops in Egypt and Iraq. The less we insistin these countries the more they will want us to stay. We should make theutmost of our command of the air and of all modern facilities for the rapidtransport of troops, concentrating the latter in areas where they are a politicalasset rather than a liability and making their presence felt elsewhere by regularjoint exercises with local forces of all sorts. I submit, moreover, that the adequacy of road and rail communications should be carefully studied withspecial attention to our liabilities in the Iraqi and Persian oilfields and at thehead of the Persian Gulf. What we should aim at is a well-planned skeletonwith bases and communications adapted each to each, which can be rapidlyclothed with muscular flesh should the emergency arise. And we must neverforget, in the defence arrangements which we make, how vital the friendshipor otherwise of the brave but ignorant and volatile Arab peoples will always beto Imperial security in the Middle East.Relations with other Powers in the Middle East.30. There are three Powers of great consequence to us outside this area which can also make themselves felt to our advantage or disadvantage in theMiddle East.   They are France, Russia and. the United States.France.31. France has a great tradition and a powerful cultural influence in theMiddle East, and she attaches deep importance, mainly from the standpoint of prestige, to her position in the Levant States. First as the protector ofChristians, later as the apostle of her own rich culture, and finally as theMandatory Power, she has struck deep roots in both countries, and she feels thata loosening of her hold will be of serious disadvantage to her as well as bitterlypainful to French sentiment. But her record since the last war tells profoundlyagainst her, and she has, despite our support, to reckon with determined opposition on the part of the United States and Russia to her claim of privilegeand pre-eminence. She also has the Arab League against her, since the only two subjects on which that new creation is solidly united are fear of Zionistand opposition to French pretensions in the Levant.32. It has been argued that the natural xenophobia of the Arab worldmight turn exclusively against Britain, if it lost its fear of the Jews and alsoits fear of the French. There is no question that the peoples of these countries are apt to blame the foreigner wTho is closest to them when they have cause for discontent, and that British standing here will be seriously imperilled if weare not consistently wise and understanding in our political technique; but,given that essential proviso, I do not believe that the elimination of France asa Middle Eastern Power would be embarrassing to us, because the fear of russia is so great. In other ways, moreover, we stand to lose much more than we stand to gain by backing France, because to identify ourselves with her pretensionsis to identify ourselves with a colonising aim and method which are anathemato all the Arab States. The Arab League would not be interesting itself inMorocco, if it were not determined to make an end by all means of France&apos;sFrenchifying cult. France seems unable to produce; men capable of under-standing the mind and winning the heart of the virile, inconstant and warm-blooded Arab peoples. We have all we need of such men and we ought not to compromise their value to us by refusing to recognise that they and the Frenchtype which prevails in the Levant are oil and vinegar respectively to the Arabpeoples.33. It is therefore of serious importance to us that France should bedissuaded from the purpose on which she seems at present set, of attempting to[30116] c
re-establish a special position in the Levant by reinforcing her troops. But evenif she desists from that, her considerable interests in the Levant will have tobe regulated by an agreement of some sort, and we shall have to face the certainty that neither in military matters nor in diplomatic status nor in education orcommerce or finance will the Levantine peoples concede anything to her whichthey do not concede on equal terms to other nations, more especially ourselves and the United States. The American Government is, 1 understand, determined on that principle, and&apos; we shall only throw away the friendship and trust whichwe at present command in the Levant if we attempt to engineer its peoples into any other course. It is, moreover, of the first importance that we should workin the closest possible accord with America throughout the Middle East. to persist in backing French ambitions against American and Russian declarationsand also against the fixed resolve of the Levantine peoples themselves would be to compromise our own vital interests without gaining anything for France. Theonly gainers would be third parties.34. Is there any other way in which we may, with due regard for our ownvital interest, preserve some special status for France in the Middle East 1 Thereis no doubt that, if we could do so, we would thereby prove the single-mindednessof our desire to heal the wounds of spirit which are torturing the new regime in France. The only conceivable way would be to take France into partnershipin our general responsibility for the peace of the Middle East. I wish with all my heart that we could do this, for no one more truly or strongly believes in -theimportance of rebuilding the prestige of France. But for all the truth andstrength of that wish, I would regard any such attempt at partnership in theMiddle East as calamitous. Amongst many reasons for this opinion drawn from my recent experience of French standing and French policy in this region, Iselect one as being conclusive in itself. If there had been any hope of loyalco-operation in such a partnership, France would already have given us suchco-operation in the single-minded efforts which we have made on her behalf in the levant. In place of co-operation she has given us suspicion and contempt of ouradvice; and the jealousy which she has shown in the Levant would be still morepronounced and still more unfortunate if it were allowed to spread its contagionover the whole range of our security system in the Middle East.35. Since I was then a Private Secretary to the Prime Minister and respon-sible for close liaison between No. 10 and the Foreign Office, I have a vivid recol-lection of the range and pertinacity of French intrigue against us in Turkey andthe Levant during the years 1921-22, when France was nominally working inclose and loyal accord with us on a mutally agreed policy. The result, mycolleagues will remember, was a grave humiliation the first of a long seriesto shake the prestige of Britain as victor over Turkey, liberator of the Arabpeoples, and reconqueror of Jerusalem. The complex of mind in France which&apos;sapped against us then persists ineradicably. It is in truth only blindness tothe facts of history and of national character to believe that France can ever bemade a loyal co-operator in this region. Elsewhere, yes, if we can eliminate thispurely local sore; but in the Middle East, never it is for France, as I believe,a psychological impossibility. She cannot forgive either us or herself for muchpast history. Us, for instance, she cannot forgive for the fact that while Frenchculture is much more deeply implanted than ours in Egypt and the Levant. Britisharms have all the glory and British influence has become predominant. Herselfshe can never forgive for the fact that she refused to enter Egypt with us in1882 and that our primacy there has even since been unchallengeable. It is truethat she acknowledged that primacy when the Entente was established in 1904in return for our acknowledgment of her primacy in Tunis and Morocco; butthat has not changed her inner feelings on the subject. Finally, she seemsincapable of realising that her dependence on colonial troops is fatal to herstanding with the Levantine peoples. There have been many Indian and british colonial troops in the Middle East, but they have never been used for imposingour domination on the Arab peoples; and troops from the United Kingdom havea splendid record and reputation throughout the region.. 36. I hope I shall not seem to have strayed beyond the sphere of my middle eastern responsibilities in dealing thus frankly and at length with the problemof France in the Levant. I have done so only because I have satisfied myselfby five months&apos; study of the Middle East that we cannot continue much longer to support French claims to predominance in the Levant without paying veryheavily for it.   There is no room in the Middle East for a French and a British
sphere of influence. It is useless to say that France is to have a special position,since, whatever we may say, events and her own record have made it impossible.We therefore only damage ourselves without helping her by saying it. The arab league is solid in two things only opposition to French pretensions in the levant and to the creation of a Jewish State in Palestine. I have tried in another&apos;paper to show that in Palestine we can dispel the fears of the Arab League whiledoing full justice to the Balfour Declaration. For France in the Levant wesimply cannot secure more than a settlement of her affairs in conformity withLevantine, American and Russian declarations that no nation is to have a privi-leged position in Syria and the Lebanon; and we cannot afford the running sorewhich is caused by her present attitude on the question, since it will poison ourown relations with the whole Arab League and gravely compromise a friendshipwhich is vital to imperial security.The Soviet Union.37. There is no doubt that Russia is spreading wide tentacles throughoutthe Middle East. I do not believe, however, that her purpose is aggressive ordeliberately unfriendly to us. She is merely suspicious, opportunist, and readyto spread the leaven of her political and economic evangel in any quarter of theMiddle East which shows signs of social maladjustment or unrest. The wholeregion is full of such signs, and I do not for my part believe that parliamentaryinstitutions, very imperfectly adapted from ours, will be found capable of dealingwith the awful problems of poverty, disease and ignorance, since to these problems the governing oligarchies of pashas and landowners which control all action inthe legislatures are for the most part blindly indifferent. If the Middle Eastis to be healed of these disorders, it can only be through enlightened, personalrulers who are willing, whatever the outward form, to take strong action ondisinterested advice. We may find such action practicable through the King ofEgypt, who is, I believe, conscious of the danger and amenable to unobtrusiveadvice, and the Hashimite family in Transjordan and Iraq. If we fail to secureaction through these rulers, who are masters of traditional obedience andpersonally popular with their respective subjects, there will be widespread fermentwhich Russia will exploit. Russian propaganda, so far as it can be traced, is atpresent moderate enough, but it is being sown in fertile ground, and the fearof it amongst the rulers and the wealthy oligarchies is intense. There will be nosecurity for us in the Middle East, whatever forces we maintain in it. if wefail to guide its Governments into some reasonable measure of our own regard for social justice, education, and the elementary claims of health.The United States.38. America is the only true partner which we shall find in building up asolid structure of social and military security in the Middle East. Her work in education and health has already been of great value to these countries, which all,for instance, send students to the American University and training hospitalin beyrout. We shall not need her military backing in the form of engage-men ts other than those which she may accept in the new World Order for themaintenance of peace, provided that we have her moral backing in our middle eastern policy and her co-operation in solving the economic problems which theera of transition will present. But she is our natural ally, because her leadersat home and her representatives on the spot for the greater part think and feelas we do upon the welfare of the Middle Eastern States, and because her majorinterests coincide with ours in that she needs security for the exploitation of mineral oil, aviation bases, and social contentment rather than unrest. The onlyserious grounds of trouble with her lie in differences over Palestine, in the wide-spread feeling amongst her eager traders that we are pursuing a dog-in-the-manger policy for our own selfish interest, and in the ignorant ideas of BritishImperialism which hold the American mind with unrelenting force. I have urged elsewhere that we should secure American co-operation in developingPalestine as an undivided bi-racial State under a new mandate or trust.On the other two grounds of difference, which have struck deeper roots,we shall need much skill and patience for the presentation of our case. Butthe facts are on our side, if only we can get them across. For the rest, it seemsto me that we should welcome and foster in every way open to us the rapidlvgrowing interest of America in the peace and progress of the Middle East.39. America&apos;s sudden presentation of demands for a military mission andair bases in Saudi Arabia demand some special reference, though they may prove
V2to have been made without the full knowledge or support of the AmericanGovernment. It is to the interest of the British Empire that America shouldhave commitments in the Middle East. We cannot compete with her in financiallargesse to Saudi Arabia, and there is no reason why we should object to herhaving a military mission and air bases in that Kingdom so long as she consultsbeforehand frankly with us, does nothing which conflicts with our general defence scheme, acknowledges our primacy as representatives of the world security orderin the Middle East, and gives us (on the ground of common interest in the peace and welfare of this region) her moral backing in the whole of that task.American goodwill land understanding will be important when we come to newsettlements in Egypt, Palestine and Iraq, and we must try to eliminate thedanger of rivalry with her in any field out here. Her representatives on the spothave often been most difficult, and Americans in general on the lower level areloud in their complaints against us. We must therefore make room for Americanpartnership wherever we can do so without sacrificing something vital to our own interests and try to establish an atmosphere of give-and-take. What mattersmost, in the field of security, is an official acknowledgement by the AmericanGovernment of our primary interest and responsibility in the Middle East. It isunderstood that President Roosevelt acknowledged it more than once, but thereis no record here of any formal declaration or understanding on the point. Itis greatly to be hoped that our special position in the Middle East has been satisfactorily established at the San Francisco Conference.E. G.
