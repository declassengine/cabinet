naval  SITUATION.European Waters.1. At Flushing, repairs to the locks and harbour are proceeding and thework of removing the blockships is in hand.East Indies.2. While H.M. ships Nelson (battleship), Sussex (cruiser), Empress andA meer (assault carriers) were covering the minesweeping operations oft&apos; the westcoast of Siam, they were attacked on the 26th by enemy aircraft. HALS. Vestal(minesweeper) was sunk by a suicide-bomber and the Sussex was slightly damaged; another suicide aircraft which attempted to dive on to the A meer was shot down in flames.   There weie 84 survivors from the Vestal.Carrier-borne aircraft from the covering force raided the airfield at SungeiPatani in northern Malaya, and during the attack destroyed six enemy aircraft and damaged six others; other aircraft bombed seaplane bases and railwaytargets and, operating over the Kra Isthmus, sank and damaged a number ofsmall ships in the Singora area and put 15 railway engines out of action.3. During recent patrols off the west coast of Malaya H.M. S/M Sibyl sank a coaster and nine small craft and damaged a tug and a schooner; H.M. S/MVigorous shelled a pier and attacked a beached coaster.Pacific./ apart.4. Carrier-borne aircraft from the Allied Pacific Fleets followed up theirheavy attacks on the 24th by further operations over the Kure and Kobe areas the following day. In spite of bad weather successful raids were made onwharves, railway centres, bridges, airfields, W/T stations and factories. Duringattacks on shipping six cargo ships, eight tugs and many small craft were sunk and over 60 ships, including a destroyer, were damaged. Many enemy aircraft were destroyed or damaged on the airfields.At dawn on the 28th large-scale operations against the Japanese Fleet inthe Inland Sea were resumed. The battleship Haruna and the battleship-carrierIse received further direct hits. Hits were scored on cruisers, and a largeexplosion occurred in an aircraft carrier. Two new enemy carriers, the A magiand the Katsuragi, had their flight-decks badly damaged. The battleship-carrierHyuga, three Japanese U-boats, a destroyer and about 30 other ships are reportedsunk, but there is some, doubt about the Hyuga, although it is possible that sheis resting on the bottom. In addition three destroyers, one destroyer escort, oneU-boat, five tankers and two transports were sunk and 13 destroyers or destroyerescorts, one U-boat, one submarine chaser, one M.T.B., two tankers, eight cargo ships and six transports were damaged. Aircraft from the British and US.Fleets shot down 21 enemy aircraft and destroyed or damaged nearly 300 otherson the ground.5. Before dawn on the 30th U.S. and British battleships and cruisers,supported by destroyers, heavily shelled industrial installations at Hamamatsu,on the south coast of Honshu. There was no opposition from shore batteries, andthe city, which is an industrial centre, wras left in flames. On the same day over1,000 aircraft from the combined Fleets attacked transport, airfields and. military targets in the Tokyo area. According to preliminary reports this attack was most satisfactory. Heavy damage was inflicted on Japanese ships, including a destroyer and escort vessels. During the following night a force of U.S.destroyers entered. Suruga Bay, S.W. of the Gulf of Sagami, and shelled thetown and port of Shimisu. In addition naval aircraft have sunk one escortcarrier, one transport, two midget U-boats and one M.T.B. and have damagedthree cargo ships, four transports, three destroyers and seven destroyer escorts.6. During the week heavy bombers have attacked the port of Kagoshirna in southern Kyushu, and at the port of Sasebo on the N.W. of the island an aircraft carrier and a light cruiser or destroyer were damaged. Aircraft from Okinawadamaged the battleship Haruna and aircraft carriers at Kure and sank or damaged other shipping in the harbour. Since these attacks were carried out onthe Japanese Fleet photographic reconnaissance shows that the battleshipsNagato and Haruna have been seriously damaged ; the latter was beached at Kure.
The battleship-carriers Ise and Hyuga have been damaged and the latter wasresting on the bottom at Kure. The-aircraft-carriers Amagi and Katsuragi havebeen damaged at Kure. The aircraft-carriers A so and Ikoma have not yet beencompleted (work has been stopped for several weeks) and Kasagi is completed at Sasebo but is not operational. The two converted carriers Hayataka andRyuho are effective but the latter with the light carrier Hosho may have beenslightly damaged at Kure. An unidentified escort carrier and light carrier havebeen damaged at Shido Wan; the former was possibly sunk. The heavy cruisersAoba, Tone, Myoko and Takao have all been seriously damaged. The light cruiser Oyoclo was sunk and another of the Kuma class was seriously damagedat Kure.It is estimated that the only ships of the Japanese Fleet which remaineffective are the converted carrier Hayaiaka, the converted light fleet carrierRyuho, the light training carrier Hosho and two light cruisers.Other Waters.7. On the 31st U.S. carrier-borne aircraft carried out attacks near the mouth of the Seisen River in Korea and next day they attacked installations onSakashima Island (Ryukyus), and enemy positions on Wake Island, while a U.S.battleship bombarded Wake Island.During a recent patrol H.M. S/M Supreme sank three lighters, two coastersand a tug and damaged a submarine chaser in the Gulf of Siam.A U.S. submarine has recently carried out a rocket attack on the island ofKarafuto to the north of Hokkaido. The main target was the most modern pulpmill in the Far East. A party which was landed from the submarine blew up a railway train on the east coast of the island.U.S. submarines have sunk two cargo ships off Honshu, a submarine chaserand six junks off Singapore and five small craft in the Gulf of Siam.Minesweeping.8.
