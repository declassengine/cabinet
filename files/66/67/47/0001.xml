OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET. Copy No.       32CP. (45) 97.8th August, 1945.CABINET.THE SIMLA CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State eor India.I circulate, for information, a note by the Viceroy on the Simla Conference.This is a history of the Conference with the Viceroy&apos;s impressions of the indian political leaders, and his assessment of the causes of failure.F. W. P. L.India Office, 8th August, 1945.ANNEXURE.The Simla Conference.A short account of the reception in India of the proposals of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and of the Simla Conference, may interest the Cabinet.2. The first persons to be informed of the proposals after my return werethe Members of my Executive Council. Those of my Indian Colleagues who had remained in India during my absence had been through a trying session of theLegislature and had been subjected, both in the lobbies and in the Congress Press,to constant ridicule about their impending removal. They were excited andirritable and received support from the Defence Member, Firoz Khan Noon, whoreturned a day or two before myself and, I think, gave a very tendentious andinaccurate account of what had happened in London. I was confronted with ageneral condemnation of the proposals and with a memorandum signed by seven of the nine Indian Members present (all except Usman and Roy) demanding,among other things, immediate Dominion Status. The main features of theproposals, the memorandum by the seven Members and the proceedings of twostormy Council meetings were disclosed to the Press by some of the Members.3. This was an unpromising start, but the seven Members had misjudgedboth public opinion and the strength of their own position. All of them had takenoffice on the express understanding that they might at any time be asked to makeway for Party Members in a reconstituted Council. They failed to exciteopposition to the proposals or sympathy with themselves; on the contrary, theirpublic disagreement with me and disregard for the oath of secrecy exposed themto further ridicule as a collection of irresponsible placemen. Their demonstrationprobably improved the chances of success, but it underlined one of the probableconsequences of failure-the extreme difficulty of carrying on with the members who were in. office when the proposals were made. (They have all since givenlip-service to the proposals and withdrawn their opposition; but with the majorityof them this has simply been the trimming of their sails to the prevailing wind.)4.   The statement in Parliament and my broadcast on the 14th June were well received on the whole.   It was soon clear that most educated Indians werein favour of the proposals being accepted.   The offer of the portfolio of external affairs to an Indian Member was well received.  I do not tlrnk that tho nronosal[30262]
for a High Commissioner was really understood or had much effect. The maindissentients to the proposals as a whole were, I think, the more extreme membersof the Mahasabha, who objected strongly to parity within the proposed ExecutiveCouncil between Caste Hindus and Muslims; and some of the landed andpropertied classes who had been content in the past to lean on &apos;&apos; Governmentand had made no attempt to establish themselves in politics. Such people always have a grievance if any political advance is proposed. Ivhizar, who in his heart of hearts desires no change, chacraterised the offer to me as &quot;so liberal that it made many of us shudder.&quot;I am &quot;less sure about official opinion, which is still of great importance inIndia. I think most of the Indian, and a good many of the British, officials werein favour; but there was some uneasiness and, in the Punjab, where conditionsare special, much criticism. It is, of course, easy to demolish any politicalproposals on the ground that they are addressed to politicians, who have hindered,or at least not helped, the war effort, rather than to the faithful supporters ofGovernment. On the other hand, no official critic suggested any other practicableplan. All would probably admit that a change must come some time, but somethink it should be postponed as long as possible.5. The leaders were more difficult than the general public. Gandhi,stimulated, I think, by Patel, complained that we had for the first time distin-distinguished between &quot; caste &quot; and other Hindus. He hinted at what was to be themain argument of the Congress at the conference that the Congress is anational and not a communal party. He thought the proposals were far fromclear about India&apos;s independence. &apos; He assured me that he could not possiblyattend the conference in any representative capacity, as he is not even a 4-annamember of the Congress. I was able to satisfy these preliminary &quot;doubts without giving anything away, and it was finally agreed that Azad should lead for theCongress, while Gandhi would stay in Simla for the conference but would notattend it himself. Jinnah kept an eye on my correspondence with Gandhi, whichwas published in the Press day by day. He neither accepted nor refused myinvitation, and until the conference began I was not sure whether he and the otherMuslim League representatives would attend or not.6. The conference opened on the 25th June with a full attendance. Thegeneral discussion disclosed a good deal of suspicion and animosity betweenJinnah and Azad. I was able at a fairly early stage in the proceedings to concentrate discussion on the general acceptability of the principles of theproposals, making it clear that eventual success would depend upon subsequentagreement between the parties as to the strength and composition of the newExecutive Council. Rather to my surprise, the proposals were accepted inprinciple unanimously after a very short discussion. The Congress may have had certain mental reservations, e.g., in his opening statement Azad had referred tosome guarantee about the future of the areas now under Japanese occupation asa condition to wholehearted support for the war effort. But when the conferencecame to take its decision on the proposals, no reservations of any kind were made.We then adjourned to enable the parties to consider privately the strength and composition of the new Executive Council. There was a short discussion betweenJinnah and Pant, the Congress exJ?remier of the United Provinces, which ledto nothing, and it was soon evident that the Congress and the Muslim League. were unable to come to an agreement. Jinnah, I understand, refused to meetAzad, a refusal which naturally embittered the latter. When the conference meton the 29th June, it was clear that unless I intervened it would break clown.Having ascertained formally that the parties were unable to agree and that therewas no hope of agreement, I suggested that we should abandon the attempt tofind an arithmetical formula for the composition of the Council, and that theyshould all submit lists of names to me. I would consider these lists and additionalnames of my own, and see if I could produce an Executive Council acceptable to everybody. The parties wanted a week in which to consult their respectiveWorking Committees, and I had to allow myself a further week for correspondence with the Secretary of State and consultations with the leaders. I thereforeadjourned the conference to the 14th July.7. During this long adjournment there were, so far as I know, no furthercontacts between the Congress and the Muslim League. Azad was determined to secure the inclusion in the new Council of Congress or Nationalist Muslims.In this he had the support of his Hindu colleagues; and the Congress as a whole was anxious that its representation in the new Council should be spread as far as
possible over all communities. Azad summoned to Simla the leaders of variousNationalist Muslim organisations who are much disliked by the Muslim League,and it was, I think, generally known that he was attempting to consolidate allthe minor parties with the Congress against the League. He certainly initiateddiscussions with the Sikhs and probably with the Scheduled Castes also.On the Muslim League side Jinn ah was under great pressure from hisPremiers. I understand that the ex-Premier of Bengal and the Premiers ofAssam and Sind told him that they could hardly return to their Provinces empty-handed, and that the party organisation in the Provinces was not capable of undertaking any serious political conflict. Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan is alsobelieved to have been anxious to take office. On the other hand.; Azad&apos;smanoeuvres, supported by indiscreet reports and comments in the Hindu Press,probably strengthened jinnah&apos;s own view and that of many of his followers thatit would be unsafe for the Muslim League to enter the new Executive Councilexcept on its own terms.The Sikhs and Scheduled Castes were in no great difficulty. But KhizarHyat Khan, the Premier of the Punjab, was determined that if the League took office, a non-League Muslim from the Punjab must be included in the ExecutiveCouncil. This was a further complication for Jinnah. His immediate aim wasto ensure the exclusion of Congress or Nationalist Muslims, but he was almostequally concerned to secure the exclusion of any Muslim friendly to the PunjabUnionist Party.8. In the upshot, all* parties except the Muslim League submitted theirlists. On the 7th July Jinnah wrote to me suggesting a confidential discussionof his names; stating that his Working Committee would not co-operate unlessall the Muslim Members were nominated by the Muslim League; and adding that once the composition of the new Council was determined, he would have to ask forspecial safeguards for the Muslims in its day-to-day working. I had a longinterview with Jinnah on the 8th July, but failed to move him at all. I then made my selections for the Executive Council without his assistance, includingfour members of the Muslim League and one non-League Muslim from the Punj abwho was unlikely to be particularly offensive to the League. I telegraphed myselections to London, and on receipt of authority from the Cabinet I saw Jinnahagain on the 11th July. He then flatly refused/to co-operate unless he receiveda categorical assurance that all the Muslim Members would be drawn from theLeague and that, once the Council was formed/ decisions to which the Muslimsobjected would be taken only on a vote of a specified majority say two-thirds. i could not accept either of these conditions. The second in particular, which was now raised formally for the first time, would have made the working of Councilalmost impossible. The right of communal veto, if granted to the Muslims, must also have been granted to the Hindus; and the Sikh and Scheduled Caste members would have put forward similar claims. I told Jinnah I could not agree, and itwas then clear that the conference had failed.9. On the 14th July I made a short statement to the conference. I reviewed the proceedings, explained how the failure had occurred, and said that I must take time to consider what should be done. Azad spoke temperately, but laidthe blame for the failure on the Muslim League, and suggested that the only possible solution was a firm decision between the parties and communities byHis Majesty&apos;s Government who could not divest themselves of responsibility.Rajagopalachari followed suit, and said he thought a further attempt to forman interim Executive Council on a territorial or administrative, rather thanon a communal, basis, might succeed. Jinnah made a long statement, bringingout the Muslim fear of Congress intrigue and Congress propaganda. He pitchedthe League claims higher than ever, demanding the acceptance of pakistan and a right of communal veto within the Executive Council as the price of Leagueco-operation in any provisional arrangement. He insisted that all MuslimMembers must be nominated by the League, and at one stage in his argumentseemed to demand equality within the Council between the Muslims and all othercommunities taken together. The other speeches were unimportant. Tara Singhpointed out that the Sikhs would not agree to Pakistan unless they were given a separate Sikh state of their own, and Siva Raj claimed the status of a separatemajor community for the Scheduled Castes. When all the leaders had had theirsay the proceedings ended.   They were less heated than I expected.* I do not include tlie European Group, which, for obvious reasons, decided not to sendin a list.
10. During the conference I had talks with Jinnah, Gandhi, Azad (accom-panied by Pant), and Nehru. Gandhi, in spite of his great influence and sensi-tiveness to public opinion, is not capable of securing a communal settlement. I doubt if he or his Working Committee could ever think in terms of genuineco-operation with the Muslims other than those who are members of the Congressorganisation. The Congress list was carefully drawn up to ensure Congressdomination in the new Council. The names, or most of them, were published in the Hindu newspapers with laudatory comments on the broadmindedness ofthe party.Jinnah is narrow and arrogant, and is actuated mainly by fear and distrustof the Congress. Like Gandhi he is constitutionally incapable of friendlyco-operation &quot;with the other party.Azad is an old-fashioned scholar with pleasant manners, but I doubt if hecontributes very much to Congress policy. His main object is to get even withJinnah and the League Muslims who despise him as a paid servant of theCongress.Nehru is an idealist, and I should say straight and honest. His conversationwith me was largely taken up with India&apos;s problems and grievances, and his views were reasonable. He has been much moved by the stories he has heard of the suppression of the 1942 disturbances, and it was on this subject alone that heshowed heat during his conversation with me. Having devoted most of his lifeto agitation, he is probably not very practical, but he would be more likely tomake friends with the Muslims than the other Hindu leaders I have seen. I hadanother talk with him after the conference was over, and asked him to use his influence to improve the relations between the two communities.It is significant that none of the leaders who really count in the main com-munities has held high office. There are therefore many misconceptions aboutthe working of the Executive Council and of the Government machine generallywhich it is almost impossible to remove.11. The immediate cause of the failure of the conference was Jinnah&apos;sintransigence about Muslim representation and Muslim safeguards. The deepercause was the real distrust of the Muslims, other than Nationalist Muslims, forthe Congress and the Hindus. Their fear that the Congress, by parading its national character and using Muslim dummies, will permeate the entire adminis-tration of any united India is real, and cannot be dismissed as an obsession ofJinnah and his immediate entourage.12. The failure of any political move narrows the field for future negotia-tions, and now that Jinnah has rejected a move within the present constitutionbased on parity between the Caste Hindus and the Muslims, it is not clear what he would be prepared to accept short of Pakistan. My view that any discussion which involves an immediate decision on the Pakistan issue (e.g., an academicdiscussion of the future constitution) must at present fail has, I think, provedcorrect. The recent proposals were rejected not on their merits, but as soon asthe discussion reached a point at which the Muslims felt obliged to raftse a com-munal principle. gandhis final comment to me at the interview when I told him of the failure was that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to decide sooner or later whether to come down on the side of Hindu or Muslim, of Congress orLeague, since they could never reconcile them. A discouraging comment but trueunder present leadership.W.Viceroy&apos;s Camp, Simla, 15th July, 1945.
