THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 73.\lth July, 1945.CABINET.CEYLON CONSTITUTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. On the 7th June, 1944, the War Cabinet approved a proposal to appoint a Commission to examine the question of constitutional reform in Ceylon, onthe understanding that this did not involve any further commitments byHis Majesty&apos;s Government than those contained in the Declaration made byHis Majesty&apos;s Government in 1943, set Annexure I to W.P. (44) 299.2. The Commission, under the Chairmanship of Lord Soulbury, which visitedCeylon from December to April last to study the question of constitutional reform in consultation with the political and other interests concerned in the Island, havenow submitted their report to me, and proof copies will be available towards theend of July.3. Final decisions on policy will be of such importance as to need discussion by the Cabinet and I think the most convenient way of dealing with the matter would be to set up a small Committee of Ministers such as was appointed to dealwith the Ceylon Constitutional Reform proposals in 1943 (W.M. (43) 70th Con-elusions). The Ministers chiefly concerned are the Service Ministers, the Secretaryof State for India, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade.4. The matter is of some urgency as the Leader of the State Council in ceylon, Mr. Senanayake, is shortly arriving in this country for  discussions with me.O. S.Colonial Office, 11th July, 1945.L30203]
