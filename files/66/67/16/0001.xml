Copy No.flth-July, 1945 \^CABINET.COAL:   ADDITIONAL BUNKERING REQUIREMENTS.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.THE Minister of Fuel and Power &apos;s paper (CP. (45) 60) on additional requirements for bunker coal raises issues of vital importance to my Department,on which I think I should let my colleagues have my comments at once.I confirm that there will be a materially increased demand for bunker coalarising from the movement to this country of Swedish, Norwegian and Danishships, which have previously been immobilised, and also of a number of Germanprize ships. The bulk of the coal required, however, need not be large coal ofthe type used for gasworks and railways, and the Ministry of Fuel and Powerwere informed, when they were advised of the new requirements, that a largeproportion of small coal or washed slack coal might be supplied to these ships.As they know, I am prepared to accept any quality provided it enables theships to steam satisfactorily.My estimate of the additional coal required to bunker these ships in theUnited Kingdom was between 50,000 and 70,000 tons per month. I do not,however, anticipate that the full load will be felt before the middle of August.It is difficult to give a fixed estimate in view of the uncertainty as to the destina-tions to which coal-burning vessels will be directed to trade, but I think thatthe figure given in CP. (45) 60, which puts the increase at over 100,000 tons per month is too high. On the other hand, British-controlled vessels will in thenext twelve months require more bunkers in the United Kingdom than they didin the coal year 1944-45,. when all programmes to and from the United kingdom were severely cut to enable &quot; Overlord &quot; to be mounted.I have indicated that I am prepared for the arrangements made with theUnited States which were set out in L.P. (45) 41, to continue, although theyresult in a loss of cargo carrying capacity of vessels sailing from the UnitedStates and Canada to the United Kingdom and Europe. To relieve the UnitedKingdom coal situation I have also instructed that (a) coal-burning ships leaving the United Kingdom for India and beyond should bunker here for the voyage to port Said only. This is resulting in much heavier requirements at Port Saidwith a consequent increased use of shipping to carry South African coal to port said and (b) ships leaving the United Kingdom for South America should bunkerfor the outward voyage only; this requires increased deliveries in South Americauh consequent increased use of shipping to carry South African coal to SouthAmerica.It is not possible to reduce the bunkering requirements in the UnitedKingdom set out above by transferring the load elsewhere. All our arrangements are designed to give the maximum relief to the United Kingdom coal position,and ships of all nations acceding to U.M.A. have to conform to our bunkeringarrangements. Further relief will only come if and when coal is available onthe Continent in sufficient quantities to bunker North Sea traders either for the voyage from the Continent to England or eventually for the round voyageContinent-England-Continent. The possibility of using Polish coal ex Danzigfor bunkering purposes at Scandinavian ports will be fully explored, although itis likely that such Polish coal as is available will be in the first instance needed for continental Europe.[30191]
I agree with the Minister of Fuel and Power that it is essential that the .railway stocks in this country should be substantially increased. I also agree theUnited States should be pressed to agree to continue the bunker switcharrangements after the end of August, and that, as from that date, no furtherlocomotive coal should be shipped from this country to Europe ?and^-^theMediterranean. .   &quot;J      &quot;&apos;I could not, however, contemplate laying up ships during July and ^august and thus reducing the shipping resources of the United Nations as suggestedby the Minister of Fuel and Power, for obviously this would seriously retardthe rehabilitation of liberated Europe and deprive the United Kingdomof timber from the Baltic required &quot; for the housing programme and ofother essential supplies from Scandinavian countries. All the voyages under-taken by the ships in question are subject to the approval of the United MaritimeExecutive Board and only essential cargoes are carried.L.Ministry of War Transport,7th July, 1945.
