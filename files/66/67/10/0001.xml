THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYEIPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1945.Copy No.cabinet coal : ADDITIONAL BUNKERING REQUIREMENTS.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.I am faced with a materially increased demand for bunker coal arising fromthe movement to this country of Swedish, Norwegian and Danish ships whichhave not been available to the Allies during the war, and also of a number ofGerman prize ships. The bulk of the coal required for bunkers will be large coalof the type used in gas works and railways and by domestic consumers.2. I have made arrangements to deal with the immediate problem of getting the ships to this country. We are supplying, mainly at the expense of the rail-ways, about 70,000 tons of suitable coal for this purpose. In addition to this tonnage, it is estimated that during the months of July and August the continuedbunkering of these ships would represent an increased demand of the order of100,000 tons in the two months, and that after August the increase may be some-thing over 100,000 tons per month.3. In the coal budget for 1945-46 submitted by me on the 9th March (L.P.(45) 61) I indicated (particularly in paragraph 8) a serious shortage of large coal.The operation of the summer coal programmes to date show that this indicationwas fully justified. Railway stocks now stand at only about 1-6 weeks, and on present performance I see no possibility of increasing them appreciably above thisdangerously low figure. The gas coal programme at the moment seems unlikely to reach the October stock target of 4^ weeks which compares with a stock of6 weeks which has in past years been regarded as the minimum for safety. the domestic market cannot stand any further cuts.4. In February I raised the question of our difficulty in meeting the supplyof large coal to North-West Europe and certain arrangements were made withthe United States, which were set out in L.P. (45) 41. Briefly these arrangementsprovided that the United States would take over some of our oversea bunkercommitments and would also arrange to bunker transatlantic ships for the returnvoyage. As a result of the relief thus obtained we were able to enter into a commitment to continue supplying large coal to North-West Europe, and ourpresent commitments in this respect are some 92,000 tons per month of loco coal and 12,000 tons per month of gas coal, which we have agreed to supply up to theend of August.5. In view of the shortage of large coal, and the probable incidence of theincreased bunker demand, I can see no possibility of continuing to supply coal,other than a limited quantity of low-grade coals, to Europe and the Mediterraneanafter the end of August. I am compelled to suggest that we must ask to be relieved of the supply of these coals to the Continent after that date, and that in additionwe should ask the United States to continue the bunker switch for a further period.6. The only alternatives to such action would be either not to supply theincreased bunker requirements, or to supply these at the expense of our inlandrailway commitments. This would reduce railway stocks to such a level as to makeimpracticable full railway operation in this country during the winter.[30168]SECRET.CP. (45) 60.5th July, 1945.
27. It will not be sufficient, however, to secure agreement to the proposals that North-West Europe requirements of loco and gas coal after the end ofAugust should be met from some source other than the United Kingdom, and thatthe bunker switch arrangements with the United States should continue after that date.8. I consider it imperative that the railway stocks in this country should beincreased before the end of November by not less than 150,000 tons, equivalentto about half a week&apos;s supply. This represents a monthly increase of 50,000 tonsin supply during the months of September, October and November. This can onlybe achieved, even if the proposals of paragraph 7 are accepted, by limiting theUnited Kins;dom contribution to the - additional bunkering demands to40,000 tons per month, the remainder being met from other sources than theUnited Kingdom.9. If these arrangements are made we could with some difficulty make endsmeet after the end of August, but they will not help us during the months of july and August, during which period we must meet our large coal commitments to north-West Europe. The additional bunker requirements during these twomonths could only be met at the expense of the inland railway programme. Inthese circumstances I must invite my colleagues to consider laying up the majorportion of the additional ships during these two months in order to minimise the strain on inland railway coal supplies.10.   Further, I recommend that (a) the United States should be invited to continue the relief they are atpresent giving us by meeting some of our overseas bunker commitments and by bunkering transatlantic ships for the round trip, and that thisrelief should continue until our present critical position shows signsof easing;(5) the United Kingdom should not export any locomotive or gas coal afterAugust;(c) thereafter,  out of  the  locomotive  coal  tonnage  so made  available,50,000 tons per month be allocated to the railways and that the UnitedKingdom contribution to additional bunkering be limited to40,000 tons per month;(d) the balance of bunkering requirements be met by extending the presentbunker switch arrangements with the United States on the basis thatall available sources of supply should take their share in meetingadditional commitments which involve the international interests ofthe Allied Nations, bearing in mind that the only alternative to suchan extension of the bunker switch would appear to be the furtherlaying up of ships now becoming available.G.
