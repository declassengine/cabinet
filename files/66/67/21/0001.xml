THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET. &quot;       Copy No.CP. (45) 71.KM July, 1945.CABINET.RELAXATION OF RESTRICTIONS ON DEPARTURE  OF BRITISHSUBJECTS FOR OVERSEAS DESTINATIONS (OP. (45) 50).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I am concerned at the effect of the proposals submitted by the Home secretary in the above paper on the security examination and control of British subjectsproposing to visit India. India not being a country for which communications are subject to censorship, the proposal in paragraph 6 of the Home Secretary&apos;smemorandum would dispense with a security examination before the issue of anexit permit to a British subject leaving this country for India.2. I feel strongly that this effect of the proposals constitutes a risk whichin present circumstances it would be unwise to take and to which I would notwillingly agree. India is an important base for the prosecution of the war against japan and is still close to the scene of hostilities. It is essential that there shouldbe no relaxation of the security check on civilians going to the country. Eventhough the Government of India were given time to tighten up the security arrangements at the ports of entry, control would be weakened if the securitysupervision provided hitherto at this end by the scrutiny of applications for exitpermits were surrendered. There is the further consideration that, at a timewhen passages are scarce, it would be an indefensible waste of passage accommoda-tion if a traveller from this country should be in a position to arrive at an Indianport, then to be refused entry. I would therefore urge that in whatever new arrangements are introduced the Passport Office should be instructed to treatapplications for exit permits for India (and Burma so far as it is possible at all for travellers to proceed there) as though made for a censorship country andtherefore subject as heretofore to security examination. I recognise that responsibility for the refusal of an exit permit on security grounds would haveto be borne by the Secretary of State for India (or in due course by the Secretaryof State for Burma).3. In other respects I am prepared to agree to the recommendations in theHome Secretary&apos;s memorandum, that is, that the exit permit system should nolonger be used as a means of passage control, subject to its being replaced asproposed by an alternative and stringent control of passages which, in view oftheir scarcity, is very necessary for journeys to India. It is essential that anadequate supply of passages should be available for officials and non-officialsengaged on Government work or work of importance to Government in India,and for the families and others on whose behalf an official recommendation hasbeen received from India after investigation by the Government of India&apos;sHardship Committee. I further think it important that no general ban on travelby families should be imposed as the result of any desire on the part of the WarOffice or Air Ministry to keep Service families away from their husbands whenserving out of the United Kingdom.L. S. AIndia Office, 10th July, 1945.[30197]
