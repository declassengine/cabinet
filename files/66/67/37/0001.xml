B PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJKSTY&apos;S GOYERPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 87.20*72, July, 1945.CABINET.RELAXATION OF RESTRICTIONS ON DEPARTURE OF BRITISHSUBJECTS FOR OVERSEAS DESTINATIONS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. Since my memorandum (CP. (45) 50) of the 25th June was. prepared,the fears which&apos;were expressed in paragraph 8 regarding the ability of the passport and Permit Office staff to deal with the increased volume of applicationshave been realised. No additional staff is obtainable; and the procedure fordealing with applications mast be simplified if a breakdown is to be avoided. Tothis end the present arrangements have been examined, and a procedure has been evolved which, while necessarily involving some relaxation of present securitychecks, will effect a considerable economy of time and labour, provided that somedeparture from traditional practice can be agreed upon as regards the issue andendorsement of British passports.2. The proposal is that, instead of an exit permit being endorsed on the passport, reliance should be placed on the validation of the passport itself for specified destinations, as a signal to the Immigration staff at the ports thatdeparture for those destinations has been duly authorised. Thus the holder ofa passport endorsed as valid for France will be free to travel to France at anytime during the currency of the passport in the same way as if he had obtainedan exit permit endorsed on the passport in respect of a particular journey toFrance. This will involve a departure from traditional practice in two respects.It will be necessary to withhold a passport from a British subject within theage groups 18-30, unless the Ministry of Labour and National Service agrees that there is no objection to his departure on man-power grounds, or, for special reasons in an individual case, it is considered that, despite objections on man-power grounds, the journey should be permitted. In the second place, in orderto meet the request by the Secretary of State for India (CP. (45) 71) that a security check shall be maintained on civilian travellers to India or Burma, itwill be necessary to abandon the practice whereby passports have been given a&quot; British Empire &quot; endorsement as a matter of course. The normal endorsementwill have to exclude India and any other parts of the Empire where a securitycheck is required, unless the applicant wants to travel there and security clearanceis obtained. In time of war departures from peace-time traditions are inevitable;and the advantages of the proposed change, so far as economy of staff and convenience to the public are concerned, are incontestable.3. If approval is given to these proposals, which are changes in the formrather than the substance of those set out in my memorandum of the 25th June,it is suggested that the proposed change of procedure should not come into effect for some three or four weeks. After VE plus 90 (5th August) a security checkwill be required only in respect of persons going to Sweden, Switzerland, Spain,Portugal or India, apart from areas for entry into which a military permit isrequired. It will then be possible to grant a passport on request to any british subject, not within the ages 18-30. who is not on the security &quot; Stop &quot; list andwishes to proceed to any part of the world other than those mentioned above.4.   Special instructions would be required to bring within these arrange-ments persons already holding passports which are still valid or capable ofrenewal, since these passports will bear the &quot;British Empire&quot; endorsement.[30249]
Such persons could he required to submit their passports for re-validation afterthe appointed day. but this would involve additional work for the PassportOffice, and I submit that it is unnecessary for the following reasons :- (a) Such a passport will have been issued or renewed only within the last fiveyears, and then only on the grant of an exit permit.(b) Apart from the &quot;British Empire&quot; endorsement, the passport will havebeen validated only for countries for which the exit permit was authorised.To meet the special needs of India, holders of&apos;passports issued before theappointed day and endorsed as valid for the British Empire could be warned by public notice (and through travel agencies) that for travel to India a new endorse-ment by the Passport and Permit Office will be required.5. This proposal introduces some complication as regards ministerial responsibility. The Foreign Secretary is responsible for the issue of passports,while the Ffome Secretary is responsible for the measures necessary to controldeparture from the country in the interests of security and man-power. It wouldbe necessary therefore for the Foreign Secretary to instruct the Passport Office notto issue passports to persons who are within the ages of 18-30, or are included inthe security &quot; Stop &apos;&quot; list, nor to endorse passports as valid for those parts of theworld for which a security check is required, except in accordance with theinstructions of the Home Secretary. Responsibility for meeting criticism asregards the refusal of passports or endorsements in these cases would then remain with me, as it is under the exit permit system.6. It will also be necessary to persuade other passport-issuing authorities within the Empire to adopt a similar practice.7. In addition, it is now proposed, subject to the concurrence of the security service, to relax the present exit permit requirements in the case of aliensreturning to their homes, or visiting this country on conditions requiring themto leave after a short visit.D.B.S.Home Office, 20th July, 1945.
