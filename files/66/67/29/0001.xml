Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1945. /;SECRET. Copy No.  w **CP. (45) 79.13th July, 1945.CABINET.REQUISITIONING OF UNOCCUPIED HOUSES.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.ON the 6th July, the Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Scotlandand I should take any further action necessary to ensure that the maximum usewas made of any empty houses for the accommodation of inadequately housedfamilies (CM. (45) 11th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. I need not emphasise to my colleagues the importance of ensuring thathabitable houses remain empty for the shortest possible time. Our admittedimmediate need is over a million houses. However successful the start of housebuilding may be, comparatively few new houses can be ready for occupation beforethe spring. The temporary house programme does not contemplate more thanat most 50,000 of these houses being ready for occupation this year.3. The number of Service men returning and wishing to establish a homeis going to be very large and it is clear that the only way of dealing with thesituation is by making the most effective use of existing house property. I shallshortly be submitting to my colleagues proposals for the better use, on a voluntary basis, of houses in which there is a substantial amount of unused space. Thismemorandum deals only with unoccupied houses. A procedure of requisitioningsuch houses, under which 340,000 homeless persons have been rehoused in theLondon Region alone, is an essential element in housing policy, not least because it frequently enables two families to be established in one house. As an example,in the London Region the accommodation provided by a requisitioned house ison the average 6-^ persons or 1-j families.4. In these circumstances, I ask for approval of the action which I proposeto take following the decision of the Cabinet on the 10th July (CM. (45) 13thConclusions, Minute 7).5. The power of a competent authority under Defence Regulation 51 totake possession of land does not carry with it any obligation to give notice of intention to requisition. The power to take possession of unoccupied houses hasbeen delegated to Clerks to Local Authorities from 1939 onwards for many and various purposes, e.g., for accommodating evacuated families, for hostels andsick bays for evacuated children, for the homeless and for workers engaged on essential work. It has been the practice in these cases to give notice wherever possible to the owner after requisitioning and to deal sympathetically with anynotification from the owner that he wishes to occupy the house himself. More-over, Avhere at a later date the owner wishes to return to the house, the LocalAuthority, wherever possible, finds alternative accommodation for those put intothe house. The latter have not the status of statutory tenants, and if and whenthe house is de-requisitioned the owner does not incur the expense and odium of court proceedings. The requisitioning procedure is well established and ownerswill expect under present conditions that if houses are left unoccupied the CouncilClerks will use the powers delegated to them.V).   In August 1943 the delegated authority was extended to include the requisitioning of unoccupied houses required for the purpose of accommodatingfamilies inadequately housed, but in this case the authority was limited by a130226&quot;!
condition that the intention of the owner or tenant should be ascertained beforethe requisitioning took place and that he should be afforded a reasonableopportunity for letting or reoccupation, as he might choose.7. Experience has shown that the condition attached to the delegationhas rendered the power of little practical value. The approach to the ownerbefore requisition has led in many cases to fictitious tenancies followed by salesat enhanced prices or to the occupation of large houses capable of accommodatingtwo or three families by a childless couple. In comparatively few areas has the restricted power led to any appreciable accommodation being found for those in dire need of it. Indeed, in the two years, less than 4,000 additionalhouses have been secured in this way, and Local Authorities in many parts ofthe country have urged that the procedure should be simplified. In a recent example brought to my notice, the Clerk to the Local Authority stated that hehad decided to requisition some 120 houses which had been standing emptyfor some time, only to find that the approach to the owners led to tenanciesof one kind or another being arranged in 100 of the houses. While all would agree that the owner of an unoccupied house should have the opportunity ofreoccupation by himself or his family, it seems to me essential that in &quot;aperiod of national emergency &quot; the houses should in other cases be used to meetthe greatest need and this can only be determined by the responsible LocalAuthority. Moreover, the fact that unoccupied houses are not being used for those in greatest need and can be exploited must lead to discontent and criticism of the Government.8. I propose, therefore, with the approval of my colleagues, that thecondition now attached to the power to requisition houses for the inadequatelyhoused should be varied and that Clerks to Local Authorities should beauthorised to requisition unoccupied bouses subject to the conditions that after a house has been requisitioned and before it is actually brought into occupation by the Local Authority (1) notice of the requisition shall be sent by the Local Authority to theowner or his agent through the post if his name and address are known to the Authority; where the name and address are not knownthe notice shall be posted on the premises;(2) the Local Authority shall wait ten days after the sending or posting ofthe notice before bringing the house into occupation, and(3) where the owner notifies his intention to occupy the house by himself or his family, the Authority shall not proceed further in the matter,except with the special consent of my Senior Regional Officer.H. U. W.Ministry of Health, S.W. 1.13th July, 1945.
