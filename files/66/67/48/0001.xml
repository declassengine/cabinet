My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :1. It is the firm purpose of My Government to work in the closest co-opera-tion with the Governments of My Dominions and in concert with all peace-loving-peoples towards a world of freedom, peace and social justice. To this end theyare determined to crush for all time the forces of our enemies which still continuethe war in the Far East; to promote throughout the world conditions under whichall countries may face with confidence the urgent tasks of reconstruction; and tocarry out in this country those policies which have received the approval of my people. .2. At Berlin My Ministers, in conference with the President of the UnitedStates and Premier Stalin, have laid the foundations on which the peoples ofEurope, after the long nightmare of war, may restore their shattered lands. Iwelcome the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers which will shortlyhold its first meeting in London and will continue the work begun at Berlin in preparation for a final peace settlement.3. My Ministers will submit to you the Charter of the United Nations whichhas now been signed without reservation by the representatives of all the fiftyStates who took part in the Conference at San Francisco and which expresses the determination of-the United Nations to maintain peace in accordance with justice and respect for human rights and to promote the welfare of all peoples by inter-national co-operation.4. It has given Me special pleasure to meet the President of the UnitedStates on his brief visit to My country after the Conference at Berlin. I havealso been glad to express the gratitude of this country to the Supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force for his inspiring leadership in the campaign for the liberation of Europe.5. My Fleets are already co-operating with the Forces of the United states in attacks on the Japanese Islands, and My Naval, Land and Air Forces will bebrought to bear against the heart of Japanese armed resistance. Meanwhile, MyForces on sea, on land and in the air have driven from Burma all but the remnantsof the Japanese forces, and My Australian Forces have successfully begun the liberation of Borneo. In China also the tide of battle has turned and theexpulsion of the Japanese from Chinese soil has begun. I grieve for the peoples of My Empire and for all other peoples who still suffer under Japanese tyrannyand I pray that the end of their ordeal may not be long delayed.6. In Europe My Forces continue to discharge the heavy duties entailed inthe occupation of enemy countries and the relief and repatriation of the many thousands of persons who were deported from their homes by the enemy. MyNavy, aided by the Navies of My Allies, is clearing the seas of mines so thatmerchant ships and fishing fleets may once more sail in safety.7. The war against Japan will continue to demand the most strenuous efforts from both managements and workers to provide ample supplies of themost modern equipment for My Forces. It will be the special care of my ministers to see that these demands are met and to plan for the continuation inthe years after the war of the co-operation between science, industry and the armed Forces which has proved so successful.Members of the House of Commons :8. You will be asked to make further financial provision for the continuanceof the war, and for expenditure on reconstruction and other essential services.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :9. My Government will continue the orderly release of men- and women from the Armed Forces on the basis of the plans&apos; announced in the autumn oflast year and will take every step to secure that these plans are carried out withthe greatest speed consistent with our military commitments and fair treatment
to serving men and women. The arrangements already in operation for the resettlement in civil life of men and women released from the Forces and from war work, including those who have been disabled during their service, will becontinued and, where necessary, expanded.10. It will be the aim of My Ministers to see that the national resources in labour and material are employed to the full in the interests of My people and that the standard of living is progressively improved. In the pursuit ofthis aim the special problems of Scotland and Wales will have the attention ofMy Ministers.11. My Government will take up with energy the tasks of reconvertingindustry from the purposes of war to those of peace, of expanding our exporttrade, and of securing by an extension of public ownership or appropriate controlsthat our industries and services shall make their maximum contribution to thenational well-being. The orderly solution of these difficult problems will requirefrom all My people efforts comparable in intensity and public spirit to those whichhave brought us victory in the war against Germany. ^12. In order to promote employment and national development a measure will be laid before you to bring the Bank of England under public ownership and machinery will be set up to provide for effective planning of investment.A Bill will also be laid before you to socialise the coalmining industry as part ofa concerted plan for the co-ordination of the fuel and power industries.13. Legislation will be submitted to you to ensure that during the periodof transition from war to peace there are available such powers as are necessaryto secure the right use of our commercial and industrial resources and thedistribution at fair prices of essential supplies and services.14. An urgent and vital task of My Ministers will be to increase by all practicable means the number of homes available both in town and country.Accordingly they will organise the resources of the building and manufacturing industries in the most effective way to meet the housing and other essentialbuilding requirements of the nation. They will also lay before you proposals to promote the best use of land in the national interest; to improve the procedure for the acquisition of land for public purposes, and to provide for the establish -ment of national parks.15. You will be asked to approve measures to provide a comprehensive scheme of insurance against industrial injuries, to extend and improve theexisting scheme of social insurance and to establish a national health service.Legislation will be introduced to repeal the Trade Disputes and Trade UnionsAct.16. My Ministers will develop to the fullest possible extent the home production of good food. To this end they will continue, with suitableadaptations, those war-time policies under which food production has been organised and the efficiency of agriculture improved, and will take all necessary steps to promote a healthy fishing industry. The ravages of war have madeworld food supplies insufficient to meet demands, but My Ministers will do allin their power to provide and distribute food to My peoples at prices which theycan afford to pay; and they will keep in being and extend the new food services for the workers and for mothers and children which have been established during(lie war.17. A measure will be laid before you for the reorganisation of air transport.18. It will be the aim of My Ministers to bring into practical effect at theearliest possible date the educational reforms which you have already approved.19. My Government- will continue to work in close consultation with theother Members of My Commonwealth on all matters of mutual concern.20. In accordance with the promises already made to My Indian peoples,My Government will do their utmost in conjunction with the leaders of indian opinion to achieve self-government in India.. They will also press on with thedevelopment of My Colonial Empire and the welfare of its peoples.21.   I pray that Almighty God may give His blessing to your counsels.
