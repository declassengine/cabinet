P.J.G.From:     EXF.0R d. to 0.0S1550B.To:        TROOPERSInfo: -   BERLIN DIST.SPECIAL ECHELON &apos;CONTROL COMMISSION (BRIT ELEMENT)CIPHER   SECRETSHAEF!CC 42o   From G in C Brit Zone.First      At a meeting in Berlin on Saturday 7th JulyMarshal Zhukov? General Weeks, General Clay discussed.,problem of administration of Berlin.    The general arrangements for setting up the Berlin Council of three(subsequently four) Kommanclantura and their terms ofreference were settled satisfactorily and a documentembodying these arrangements is being; prepared and willbe signed on Tuesday next 10th July at a further meeting,with Marshal Zhukov.Second    2 points have been raised as regards food and coal on which no decision was reached and the questions were put back for discussion 10th July.     As regards food the Russians claim that the responsibility for feeding theGermans in the sectors of the Berlin Zone falls to thePowers occupying each Sector, , In brief we are asked as-Mil Government in our Berlin Sector as from a date whichis not yet stated to supply and distribute food to 909,000
Germans involvin - on che Russian estimate (which may notbe unreasonable) a supply from our main sone in Germanyapprox. 20,000 tons vnf month of-varying categories offoodstuffSoThird      The stock position of various commodities inBerlin as a whole varies at the moment according to russian figures from 5 days in important items to 20 days in less important items.. ....Figures of a similar natureapply to the Americans who have a somewhat smaller German.population - ne and the Americans have taken the line that the whole question is a matter for Governments asregards long &quot;term but the short term solution requires animmediate decision.on Tuesday. Although it isinconvenient and will cause all manner of disturbances asregards our own main&quot; zone (details of which are being gone)into at the moment), it may be possible as from 3 or moreweeks time to put into Berlin the equivalent of 1 month&apos;sfood for the Germans in the British &quot;Sector. The actualbreakdown of the commodities to be supplied would be amatten of detail&apos;but wheat would figure largely.Fourth    Coal presents the same sort of problem. . Thetotal requirements in Berlin for public utilitiess etc.,(not including any domestic requirements) is estimated by the Russians as 7500 tons per day of which 1000 tons is brown coal.   The Pussians are likely to bid on us for5000 tons per day.     Stocks are stated to be 4 to 5 daysbut are believed to be a bit higher.   Here again supply tcfBerlin will conflict with all our present arrangements inthe British zone and with coal ports.     The question of rail transport to Berlin is also involved.    The bridge atMagdeburg will net be ready until 25 July.   The coalquestion is also to be considered on 10th July.Fifth      General Weeks will be in London tomorrow Monday9th and will discuss above problems.    In the meantimestudies are being made here of the possibility of implementing some short term supply without prejudice to long term Government or Control Council decisions.
