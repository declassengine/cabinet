THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.CP. (45) 51.28th June, 1945.CABINET.DISPOSAL OF GERMAN WAR MATERIAL.Note by the Secretary.THE disposal of German war material has been the subject of an exchangeof minutes between the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of Staff. Annex I contains the Prime Minister&apos;s instructions to the Chiefs of Staff on this question (PrimeMinister&apos;s Personal Minute, Serial No. M. 491 /5 of the 17th May). In Annex IIthe Chiefs of Staff set out the history of this question and give their recommendations.2. The Prime Minister has directed that this matter should be consideredby the Cabinet.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th June, 1945.ANNEX I.Prime Ministers Personal Minute, Serial No. M. 491/5.Chief of the Air Staff.General Ismay, for all Concerned.No German aircraft in British control which has a serviceable war value,including spares, is to be destroyed by the Germans or by us without Cabinetsanction being obtained beforehand.(Initialled) W. S. C.17.5.45.ANNEX II.Disposal of German War Material.Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff.IN your minute (No. M. 491/5) of the 17th May, you directed that &quot;NoGerman aircraft in British control which has a serviceable war value, includingigxar^s, is to be destroyed by the Germans or by us without Cabinet sanctionbeing obtained beforehand.&quot;[30136]
2. The Combined Chiefs of Staff previously directed that after Germany&apos;ssurrender, war material inside Germany and Austria, not needed for intelligencepurposes or by the theatre Commander, should be regarded as the property ofthe United Nations for disposal through the European Advisory Commission.No agreement has therefore been reached for dealing with this material, and itis to be observed that the directive was issued when it was not appreciated tluj&apos;almost all war material within Germany and Austria would be captured v*.battle before Germany&apos;s surrender.3. War material captured outside Germany and Austria remains at thedisposal of the Combined Chiefs of Stall who have agreed that material notrequired to meet existing commitments shall be destroyed. The main objectof this policy, which was endorsed by the Ministerial A.P.W. Committee, is toreduce the risk of perpetuating enemy war potential by refusing to provideour Allies with war material of enemy pattern as this might well lead to a demandfor replacements or at least for spare parts and ammunition.4. Apart from the principle referred to in paragraph 3 above, combattypes of German aircraft are of no use to us for the following reason. the effective strength of the R.A.F. is governed by the allocations of man-power.There are no men and there is little equipment available to handle this Germanmaterial, to sort it out and to get it into working order. Most of the aircraft have been left unattended and have already deteriorated beyond the point atwhich they could be restored by available R.A.F. resources. The only possible way of making military use of this German material would be to re-establish the G.A.F. units for handling it and to revive a portion of the German aircraft industry for maintenance and replacement purposes. This would involve a com-plete change in policy towards Germany.5. As regards other forms of German war material, the acute shortage ofshipping and of storage space in the United Kingdom makes it impracticable tobring back and store in this country any appreciable quantity of German material.Theatre Commanders in Europe are already hard put to find man-power necessaryto guard and maintain even the British equipment destined later for the japanese war. General Eisenhower has, in fact, reported to the Combined Chiefs ofStaff (see SCAF 447) that the guarding and maintaining of captured material is impracticable, and he has asked for authority to meet the requirements ofthe London Munitions Assignment Board and then to scrap all remaining surplusequipment. We have reason to believe that the Americans are already anticipatingthis authority.Recommendation?.6.   We therefore recommend that :  (a) German war material should not be made available to our european allies;(b) There should be no change in the existing policy of destroying german war material outside Germany and Austria surplus to the needs of intelligence, the theatre Commanders, and of the Japanese war;(c) General eisenhower&apos;s proposal to apply the policy in (b) to German warmaterial inside Germany and Austria should be given our whole-hearted support at the Combined Chiefs of Staff.C.
