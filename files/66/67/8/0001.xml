Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET. V Copy No.CP. (45) 58.3rd July, 1945.CABINET.PROGRAMME EOR JULY,  1945.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.VICTORY in Europe was closely followed by the break-up of the coalition government and much of the time and attention of Ministers in the last fewweeks has necessarily been occupied with the chatter of the General Election.Many problems await decisions which are now7 required to enable the nation!efforts to be re-planned and re-phased to meet the end of the war in Europe.2. My colleagues have been busy in the last few weeks, but I must call on them for an intensive effort during the period between Polling Day and theannouncement of the result of the Election. During this period frequentmeetings of the Cabinet, possibly as many as three a week, may be necessary and much work must also be done by the Standing Committees of the Cabinet, whichhave now been reconstituted.I set out in the Appendix an outline of the main subjects on which, I suggest,we should seek to make substantial progress during July.3. Some Ministers will have arranged to be out of London during part ofthis time; but it is my wish that Cabinet meetings during this period should be attended by not less than eight members of the Cabinet. I have asked theSecretary of the Cabinet to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that this number is available for each of the meetings to be held during July.I hope that during any period when a Minister is himself absent he will arrange for his Department to be represented, in order that essential businessmay be pushed forward without a break.
4. During the ensuing week the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs willpreside at meetings of the Cabinet. Thereafter, when the Foreign Secretary has left for the Three-Power Conference, the Chancellor of the Exchequer willpreside.W. S. C.10 Doivninq Street, S.W3rd Sidy, 1945.APPENDIX.li- Foreign.1.

The Reparations Committee and, as necessary, theCabinet will keep in touch with the progress of the discussions at the MoscowPe parati ons Commission.4. India. The India Committee and, as necessary, the Cabinet may becalled upon to consider issues arising from the progress of the Viceroy&apos;discussions.II. Domestic5. Demobilisation. The Cabinet should consider the rare at whichdemobilisation may proceed in the immediate future, and will keep under review the progress of the demobilisation scheme.6. Man-power. The Cabinet will consider proposals by the Man-power committee for the redistribution of man-power during the second half of 1945.Proposals should also be considered for the allocation of doctors and nursesas between the Armed Forces and the civil population.7. Housing. The Housing Squad and, as necessary, the Cabinet will ensurean intensive drive forward with the housing programme as a military operation in which all controls are to be used and special brigades of demobilised menenlisted for two years at exceptionally favourable terms, to go from one part ofthe country to another getting the thing started. Among the Engineers thereare large numbers of eminently suitable men. First, five regiments of a thousandeach should be formed.    The matter of building these houses is to be handled
exactly with the energy that would have been put into any of the battles we havewon. Nothing is to stand in the way. Apart from this, points to which special attention should be given are (a) Supply of labour, both for the building and civil engineering industries,and also for factories producing building materials and components.(b) Permanent houses : measures to secure an early start with the construc-tion of permanent houses by local authorities and by private enter-prise; and to accelerate the production of prefabricated houses and components.(c) Temporary houses :  measures to expedite the preparation of sites andthe production of houses.(d) Emergency shelter; means of increasing, by temporary expedients, the living accommodation available for next winter, e.g., requisitioning,adaptation of large houses, &amp;c.(e) Measures for establishing proper control over building to ensure that theavailable labour is concentrated on high priority work.8.   Exports. Preparations for the export drive should be advanced.9. Coal. A detailed scheme must be prepared to give effect to the statementof policy made by the Minister of Fuel and Power on the 29th May on the future organisation of the coal industry. All possible steps must be taken to ensurethat adequate supplies of coal are available to meet the demand of next winter.10. Rent Restriction. Urgent consideration must be given to the recom-mendations of the Ridley Report.11. National Insurance. Further progress should be made with the preparations, both legislative and administrative, for the introduction of thisscheme.12. National Health Service. The form of the legislation required to giveeffect to the modified scheme should now be considered.
