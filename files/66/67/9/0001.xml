(45) 59.3rd July, 1945.CABINET.STANDING MINISTERIAL COMMITTEES OF THE CABINET.Note by the Prime Minister.THE Cabinet Committee system has been reviewed, on the change ofGovernment; and the standing Ministerial Committees of the Cabinet arereconstituted as shown in the following; notes.9      ..2. I wish to take this opportunity of restating two fundamental principles on which the work of Cabinet Committees must be based : (a) The work of all Cabinet Committees must be so conducted that it doesnot derogate from the departmental responsibilities of individual ministers. It follows that a Cabinet Committee, when dealino- with matters touching upon the responsibilities of a Department notpermanently represented on it, must proceed in consultation with thedepartmental Minister concerned.(b) All Cabinet  Committees  transact  their business on  behalf  of  theCabinet; and it is the duty of the Chairman to consider what decisions are of such importance that they should be referred to the Cabinet forapproval before effect is given to them.W. S. C.10 Downina Street, S.W. 1,3rd July, 1945.
