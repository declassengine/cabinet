The Council shall be utilised for the preparation of a peace settlement for Germany tobe accepted by the Government of Germany when a Governmentadequate for the purpose is established.(ii) For the discharge of each of these tasks the Council will be composed of the Members representing those States which weresignatory to the terms of surrender imposed upon the enemy state concerned. For the purposes of the peace settlement for Italy, Franceshall be regarded as a signatory to the terms of surrender for Italy.Other Members will be invited to participate when matters directlyconcerning them are under discussion.(iii) Other matters may from time to time be referred to theCouncil by agreement between the Member Governments.(4) (i) Whenever the Council is considering a question of direct interestto a State not represented thereon, such State should be invited tosend representatives to participate in the discussion arid study ofthat question.(ii) The Council may adapt its procedure to the particular problem under consideration. In some cases it may hold its ownpreliminary discussions prior to the participation of other interestedStates. In other cases, the Council may convoke a formal conferenceof the State chiefly interested in seeking a solution of the particular problem.&quot;B, It was agreed that the three Governments should each address anindentical invitation to the Governments of China and France to adopt this textand to join in establishing the Council. The text of the approved invitation was as follows :&apos; 
Council of Foreign Ministers.Draft for identical invitation to be sent separately by each of the three governments to the Governments of China and France.&quot; The Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States and theU.S.S.R. consider it necessary to begin without delay the essentialpreparatory work upon the peace settlements in Europe. To this end theyare agreed that there should be established a. Council of the Foreign ministers of the Five Great Powers to prepare treaties of peace with the Europeanenemy States, for submission to the United Nations. The Council wouldalso be empowered to propose settlements of outstanding territorial questions in Europe and to consider such other matters as member Governments might agree to refer to it.&quot; The text adopted by the Three Governments is as follows :  (Here insert final agreed text of the Proposal.)&quot; In agreement with the Governments of the United States andU.S.S.R., His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and U.S.S.R.,the United States Government, the United Kingdom and the SovietGovernment extend a cordial invitation to the Government of China(France) to adopt the text quoted above and to join in setting up the Council.His Majesty&apos;s Government, the United States Government, the SovietGovernment attach much importance to the participation of the ChineseGovernment (French Government) in the proposed arrangements, and they hope to receive an early and favourable reply to this invitation.&quot;C. The establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers for the specificpurposes named in the text will be without prejudice to the agreement of the crimea Conference that there should be periodical consultation between theForeign Secretaries of the United States, the Lrnion of Soviet Socialist Republicsand the United Kingdom.D. The Conference also considered the position of the European advisory commission in the light of the Agreement to establish the Council of foreign ministers. It was noted with satisfaction that the Commission had ablydischarged its principal tasks by the recommendations that it had furnished forthe terms of surrender for Germany, for the zones of occupation in Germany and austria and for the inter-Allied control machinery in those countries. It was felt that further work of a detailed character for the co-ordination of allied policy for the control of Germany and Austria would in future fall within thecompetence of the Control Council in Berlin and the Allied Commission at Vienna.Accordingly it was agreed to recommend that the European Advisory Commissionbe &quot;dissolved.II. The Principles to Govern the Treatment of Germany in the Initial ControlPeriod.A. Political Principles.1. In accordance with the Agreement on Control Machinery in Germany,supreme authority in Germany is exercised, on instructions from their respective governments, by the Commanders-in-Chief of the armed forces of the UnitedStates of America, the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicsand the French Republic, each in his own zone of occupation, and also jointly,in matters affecting Germany as a whole, in their capacity as members of theControl Council.2. So far as is practicable, there shall be uniformity of treatment of theGerman population throughout Germany.3. The purposes of the occupation of Germany by which the Control council shall be guided are (i) The complete disarmament and demilitarisation of Germany and the elimination or control of all German industry that could be used formilitary production.   To these ends :  (a) All German land, naval and air forces, the S.S., S.A., S.U. andGestapo, with all their organisations, staffs and institutions,including the General Staff, the Officers&apos; Corps, Reserve Corps,
military schools, war veterans&apos; organisations and all other military and semi-military organisations, together with allclubs and associations which serve to keep alive the militarytradition in Germany, shall be completely and finally abolishedin such manner as permanently to prevent the revival orreorganisation of German militarism and Nazism;(6) All arms, ammunition and implements of war and all specialisedfacilities for their production shall be held at the disposal of theAllies or destroyed. The maintenance and production of all aircraft and all arms, ammunition and implements of war shallbe prevented.(ii) To convince the German people that they have suffered a total militarydefeat and that they cannot escape responsibility for what they have brought upon themselves, since their own ruthless warfare and thefanatical Nazi resistance have destroyed German economy and madechaos and suffering inevitable.(iii) To destroy the National Socialist Party and its affiliated and supervisedorganisations, to dissolve all Nazi institutions, to ensure that they arenot revived in an)&apos; form, and to prevent all Nazi and militarist activityor propaganda.(iv) To prepare for the eventual reconstruction of German political life on a democratic basis and for eventual peaceful co-operation in inter-national life by Germany.4. All Nazi laws which provided the basis of the Hitler regime or establisheddiscrimination on grounds of race, creed, or political opinion shall be abolished.No such discriminations, whether legal, administrative or otherwise, shall be tolerated.5. War criminals and those who have participated in planning or carryingout Nazi enterprises involving or resulting in atrocities or war crimes shall be arrested and brought to judgment. Nazi leaders, influential Nazi supporters and high officials of Nazi organisations and institutions and any other personsdangerous to the occupation or its objectives shall be arrested and interned.6. All members of the Nazi party who have been more than nominal parti-cipants in its activities and all other persons hostile to Allied purposes shall beremoved from public and semi-public office, and from positions of responsibility in important private undertakings. Such persons shall be replaced by personswho, by their political and moral qualities, are deemed capable of assisting in developing genuine democratic institutions in Germany.7. German education shall be so controlled as completely to eliminate Naziand militarist doctrines and to make possible the successful development of democratic ideas.8. The judicial system will be reorganised in accordance with the principlesof democracy, of justice under law, and of equal rights for all citizens without distinction of race, nationality or religion.9. The administration in Germany should be directed towards the decentrali-sation of the political structure and the development of local responsibility. Tothis end :  (i) Local self-government shall be restored throughout Germany on demo-cratic principles and in particular through elective councils as rapidly as is consistent with military security and the purposes of military occupation;(ii) all democratic political parties with rights of assembly and of public discussion shall be allowed and encouraged throughout Germany ;(iii) representative and elective principles shall be introduced into regional.provincial and state (Land) administration as rapidly as may bejustified by the successful application of these principles in local self-government;(iv) for the time being, no central German Government shall be established.Notwithstanding this, however, certain essential central Germanadministrative departments, headed by State Secretaries, shall beestablished, particularly in the fields of finance, transport, communica-tions, foreign trade and industry. Such departments will act underthe direction of the Control Council.
10. Subject to the necessity for maintaining military security, freedom of speech, press and religion shall be permitted, and religious institutions shall be respected. Subject likewise to the maintenance of military security, the formationof free trade unions shall be permitted.B. Economic Principles.11. In order to eliminate Germany&apos;s war potential, the production of arms,ammunition and implements of war as well as all types of aircraft and sea-going ships shall be prohibited and prevented. Production of metals, chemicalsmachinery and other items that are directly necessary to a war economy, shallbe rigidly controlled and restricted to Germany&apos;s approved post-war peace-time needs to meet the objectives stated in paragraph 15. Productive capacitynot needed for permitted production shall be removed in accordance with the reparations plan recommended by the Allied Commission on reparations and approved by the Governments concerned or, if not removed, shall be destroyed.12.   At  the earliest  practicable  date,  the  German  economy  shall  bedecentralised for the purpose of eliminating the present excessive concentration- of economic power as exemplified in particular by cartels, syndicates, trusts andother monopolistic arrangements.13. In organising the German economy, primary emphasis shall be givento the development of agriculture and peaceful domestic industries.14. During the period of occupation Germany shall be treated as a singleeconomic unit. To this end common policies shall be established in regardto-(a) mining and industrial production and its allocation;(b) agriculture, forestry and fishing;(c) wages, prices and rationing;(d)&apos; import and export programmes for Germany as a whole;(e) currency and banking, central taxation and customs;(/) reparation and removal of industrial war potential;(g) transportation and communications.In applying these policies account shall be taken, where appropriate, of varying local conditions.15. Allied controls shall be imposed upon the German economy but onlyto the extent necessary  .(a) to carry out programmes of industrial disarmament and demilitarisation-tion, of reparations, and of approved exports and imports;(b) to assure  the  production  and  maintenance  of  goods  and  services required to meet the needs of the occupying forces and displaced persons in Germany and essential to maintain in Germany averageliving standards not exceeding the average of the standards of living of European countries. (European countries means all european countries excluding the United Kingdom and the Union of soviet socialist Republics);(c) to ensure in the manner determined by the Control Council the equitable distribution of essential commodities between the several zones so asto produce a balanced economy throughout Germany and reduce theneed for imports;id) to control German industry and all economic and financial internationaltransactions, including exports and imports, with the aim of preventing Germany from developing a war potential and of achieving the other objectives named herein;(e) to control all German public or private scientific bodies, research and experimental institutions, laboratories, &amp;c, connected with economicactivities.16. In the imposition and maintenance of economic controls establishedby the Control Council, German administrative machinery shall be created andthe German authorities shall be required to the fullest extent practicable to proclaim and assume administration of such controls. Thus it should bebrought home to the German people that the responsibility for the administrationof such controls and any breakdown in these controls will rest with themselves.Any German controls which may run counter to the objectives of occupationwill be prohibited.
17.   Measures shall be promptly taken-(a) to effect essential repair of transport;(h) to enlarge coal production;(c) to maximise agricultural output;       i:(d) to effect emergency repair of housing and essential utilities.18. Appropriate steps shall be taken by the Control Council to exercise control and the power of disposition over German-owned external assets not already under the control of United Nations which have taken part in the war against Germany.19. Payment of reparations should leave enough resources to enable theGerman people to subsist without external assistance. In working out theeconomic balance of Germany the necessary means must be provided to pay for imports approved by the Control Council in Germany. The proceeds of exports from current production and stocks shall be available in the first place for payment for such imports.The above clause will not only apply to the equipment and products referredto in paragraph 4 (a) and 4 (b) of the Reparations Agreement.III. Reparations from Germany.1. Reparation claims of the U.S.S.R. shall be met by removals from thedone of Germany occupied by the U.S.S.R., and from appropriate Germanexternal assets.2. The U.S.S.R. undertakes to*settle the reparation claims of Poland fromits own share of reparations.3. The reparations claims of the United States, the United Kingdom andother countries entitled to reparations shall be met from the Western Zonesand from appropriate German external assets.4. In addition to the reparations to be taken by the U.S.S.R. from itsown zone of occupation, the U.S.S.R. shall receive additionally from the western zones :(a) 15 per cent, of such usable and complete industrial capital equipment, inthe first place from the metallurgical, chemical and machine manu-facturing industries, as is unnecessary for the German peace economy and should be removed from the Western Zones of Germany, in exhange for an equivalent value of food, coal, potash, zinc, timber,clay products, petroleum products, and such other commodities asmay be agreed upon.(b) 10 per cent, of such industrial capital equipment as is unnecessary forthe German peace economy and should be removed from the western zones, to be transferred to the Soviet Government on reparationsaccount without payment or exchange of any idnd in return.Removals of equipment as provided in (a) and (b) above shall b*e made simultaneously.5. The amount of equipment to be removed from the Western Zones onaccount of reparations must be determined within six months from now at thelatest.6. Removals of industrial capital equipment shall begin as soon as possible and shall be completed within two years from the determination specified inparagraph 5. The delivery of products covered by 4(a) above shall begin as soonas possible and shall be made by the U.S.S.R. in agreed instalments within fiveyears of the date hereof. The determination of the amount and character ofthe industrial capital equipment unnecessary for the German peace economy and therefore available for reparations shall be made by the Control council under policies fixed by the Allied Commission on Reparations, with the participa-tion of France, subject to the final approval of the Zone Commander in the Zonefrom which the equipment is to be removed.7. Prior to the fixing of the total amount of equipment subject to removal,advance deliveries shall be made in respect of such equipment as will be deter-mined to be eligible for delivery in accordance with the procedure set forth inthe last sentence of paragraph 6.
8. The Soviet Government renounces all claims in respect of reparationsto shares of German enterprises which are located in the Western Zones ofoccupation in Germany as well as to German foreign assets in all countries except those specified in paragraph 9 below.9.

The Soviet Government makes no claims to gold captured by the allied troops in Germany.IY.-Disposal of the German Navy and Merchant Marine.A.The following principles for the distribution of the German Navy were agreed : (1) The total strength of the German surface navy, excluding ships sunk and these taken over from Allied Nations, but including ships under construction or repair, shall be divided equally among the U.S.S.R.,United Kingdom and United States.(2) Ships under construction or repair means those ships whose constructionor repair may be completed within three to six months, according tothe type of ship. Whether such ships under construction or repairshall &quot;be completed or repaired shall be determined by the technicalcommission appointed by the Three Powers and referred to below,subject to the principle that their completion or repair must beachieved within the time limits above provided, without any increaseof skilled employment in the German shipyards and without per-&quot;mitting the reopening of any German ship building or connectedindustries.

The Commission will hold its first meeting not later than the 1st September, 1945, in Berlin, which shall be its headquarters. Each delegation on the Commission will have theright, on the basis of reciprocity, to inspect the German merchant ships wherever they may be located.V. City of Konigsberg and the Adjacent Area.The Conference examined a proposal by the Soviet Government to the effectthat, pending the final determination of territorial questions at the peace settlement, the section of the western frontier of the Union of Soviet socialist republics which is adjacent to the Baltic Sea should pass from a point on theeastern shore of the Bay of Danzig to the east, north of Braunsberg-Goldap, tothe meeting point of the frontiers of Lithuania, the Polish Republic and east prussia.The Conference has agreed in principle to the proposal of the SovietGovernment concerning the ultimate transfer to the Soviet Union of the City ofKonigsberg and the area adjacent to it as described above subject to expertexamination of the actual frontier.The President of the United States and the British Prime Minister have declared that they will support the proposal of the Conference at the forthcomingpeace settlement.YI. War Criminals.The Three Governments have taken note of the discussions which have been proceeding in recent weeks in London between British, United States, Soviet andFrench representatives with a view to reaching agreement on the methods of trial of those major war criminals whose crimes under the Moscow Declaration ofOctober 1943 have no particular geographical localisation. The Three Govern-ments reaffirm their intention to bring these criminals to swift and sure justice.They hope that the negotiations in London will result in speedy agreement being reached for this purpose, and they regard it as a matter of great importance thatthe trial of .tbese major criminals should begin at the earliest possible date. Thefirst list of defendants will be published before the 1st September.YII. Austria.The Conference examined a proposal by the Soviet Government on the exten-sion of the authority of the Austrian Provisional Government to all of Austria.The three Governments agreed that they were prepared to examine thisquestion after the entry of the British and American forces into the city of vienna.It was agreed that reparations should not be exacted from Austria.
VIII.-Poland.A. Declaration.We have taken note with pleasure of the agreement reached among representa-tive Poles from Poland and abroad which has made possible the formation, inaccordance with the decisions reached at the Crimea Conference, of a PolishProvisional Government of National Unity recognised by the Three Powers. Theestablishment by the British and United States Governments of diplomatic relations with the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity has resultedin the withdrawal of their recognition from the&apos; former Polish Government inLondon, which no longer exists.The British and United States Governments have taken measures to protect the interests of the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity, as the recognised Government of the Polish State, in the property belonging to the PolishState located in their territories and under their control, whatever the form ofthis property may be. They have further taken measures to prevent alienationto third parties of such property. All proper facilities will be given to the PolishProvisional Government of National Unity for the exercise of the ordinary legalremedies for the recovery of any property belonging to the Polish State which mayhave been wrongfully alienated.The Three Powers are anxious to assist the Polish Provisional Governmentof National Unity in facilitating the return to Poland as soon as practicable ofall Poles abroad who wish to go, including members of the Polish armed forces and the merchant marine. They expect that those Poles who return home shallbe accorded personal and property rights on the same basis as all Polish citizens.The Three Powers note that the Polish Provisional Government of national unity in accordance with the decisions of the Crimea Conference has agreed tothe holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot in which all democratic and anti-Nazi parties shall have the right to takeXpart and to put forward candidates; and that repre-sentatives of the Allied Press shall enjoy full freedom to report to the world upondevelopments in Poland before and during the elections.B.  Western Frontier of Poland.In conformity with the agreement on Poland reached at the Crimea Con-ference the three Heads of Government have sought the opinion of the PolishProvisional Government of National Unity in regard to the accession of territory in the north and west which Poland should receive. The President of the national council of Poland and members of the Polish Provisional Government of national unity have been received at the Conference and have fully presented their views.The three Heads of Government reaffirm their opinion that the final delimitationof the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement.The three Heads of Government agree that, pending the final determination of Poland&apos;s western frontier, the former German territories east of a line runningfrom the Baltic Sea immediately west of Swinemiinde, and thence along the,(JderRiver to the confluence of the western Neisse River and along the western Neisseto the Czechoslovak frontier, including that portion of East Prussia not placed under the administration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in accordancewith the understanding reached at this conference and including the area of theformer free city of Danzig, shall be under the administration of the Polish Stateand for such purposes should not be considered as part of the Soviet zone ofoccupation in Germany.IX. Conclusion of Peace Treaties and Admission to the United nations organisation.The three Governments consider it desirable that the present anomalousposition of Italy, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary and Roumania should be terminatedby the conclusion of Peace Treaties. They &quot;trust that the other interested AlliedGovernments will share these views.For their part the Three Governments have included the preparation of a peace Treaty for Italy as the first among the immediate important tasks to beundertaken by the new Council of Foreign Ministers. Italy was the first of the axis Powers to break with Germany, to whose defeat she has made a materialcontribution, and has now joined with the Allies in the struggle against Japan.Italy has freed herself from the Fascist regime and is making good progress towards re-establishment of a democratic government and institutions. Theconclusion of such a Peace Treaty with a recognised and democratic Italian
Government will make it possible for the Three Governments to fulfil their desireto support an application from Italy&apos;for membership of the United Nations.The Three Governments have also charged the Council of Foreign ministers with the task of preparing Peace Treaties for Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary and roumania. The conclusion of Peace Treaties with recognised democraticGovernments in these States will also enable the Three Governments to supportapplications from them for membership of the United Nations. The three governments agree to examine, each separately in the near future, in the lightof the conditions then prevailing, the establishment of diplomatic relations withFinland, Roumania, Bulgaria and Hungary, to the extent possible prior to theconclusion of Peace Treaties with those countries.The Three Governments have no doubt that in view of the changed conditions resulting from the termination of the war in Europe, representativesof the Allied press will enjoy full freedom to report to the world upon develop-ments in Roumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland.As regards the admission of other States into the United Nations Organisa-tion, Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations declares that: 1. Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace-lovingStates who accept the obligations contained in the present charter and, in the judgment of the organisation, are able and willing to carryout these obligations;2. The admission of any such State to membership in the United nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon therecommendation of the Security Council.The Three Governments, so far as they are concerned, will support applica-tions for membership from those States which have remained neutral during thewar and which fulfil the qualifications set out above.The Three Governments feel bound, however, to make it clear that they fortheir part would not favour any application for membership put forward bythe present Spanish Government, which, having been founded with the supportof the Axis Powers, does not, in view of its origins, its nature, its record andits close association with the aggressor States, possess the qualifications necessaryto justify such membership.X. Territorial Trusteeship.The Conference examined a proposal by the Soviet Government on thequestion of trusteeship territories as defined in the decision of the Crimea conference and in the Charter of the United Nations Organisation.After an exchange of views on this question it was decided that the disposition of any former Italian Colonial territories was one to be decided inconnection with the preparation of a peace treaty for Italy and that the questionof Italian Colonial territory would be considered by the September Council of minister for Foreign Affairs.XI. Revised Allied Control Commission Procedure in Roumania, bulgaria and Hungary.The Three Governments took note that the Soviet Representatives on theAllied Control Commissions in Roumania, Bulgaria and Hungary have com-municated to their United Kingdom and United States colleagues proposalsfor improving the work of the Control Commissions, now that hostilities inEurope have ceased.The Three Governments agreed that the revision of the procedures of theAllied Control Commissions in these countries would now be undertaken,taking into account the interests and responsibilities of the Three Govern-ments which together presented the terms of armistice to the respective countries,and accepting as a basis, in respect of all three countries, the Soviet governments proposals for Hungary as annexed hereto.   (Annex I.)XII. Orderly Transfer of German Populations.The Three Governments, having considered the question in all its aspects,recognise that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elementsthereof, remaining in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, will have to beundertaken. They agree that any transfers that take place should be effected inan orderly and humane manner.
Since the influx of a large number of Germans into Germany would increasethe burden already resting on the occupying authorities, they consider that theControl Council in Germany should, in the first instance, examine the problem,with special regard to the question of the equitable distribution of these Germansamong the several zones of occupation. They are accordingly instructing theirrespective representatives on the Control Council to report to their governments as soon as possible the extent to which such persons have already entered germany from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and to submit an estimate of the timeand rate at which further transfers could be carried out having regard to thepresent situation in Germany.The Czechoslovak Government, the Polish Provisional Government and theControl Council in Hungary are at the same time being informed of the above and are being requested meanwhile to suspend further expulsions pending an examination by the Governments concerned of the report from their representa-tives on the Control Council.XIII.-Oil Equipment in Roumania.The Conference agreed to set up two bilateral commissions of experts, oneto be composed of United Kingdom and Soviet members, and one to be composed ofUnited States and Soviet - members, to investigate the facts and examine the documents, as a basis for the settlement of questions arising from the removalof oil equipment in Roumania. It was further agreed that these experts shallbegin their work within ten days, on the spot.XIY. Iran.It was. agreed that Allied troops should be withdrawn immediately fromTehran, and that further stages of the withdrawal of troops from Iran shouldbe considered at the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers to be heldin London in September 1945.XY. The International Zone of Tangier.A proposal by the Soviet Government was examined and the followingdecisions were reached.Having examined the question of the Zone of Tangier, the three Govern-ments have agreed that this Zone, which includes the city of Tangier and thearea adjacent to it, in view of its special strategic importance shall remaininternational.The question of Tangier will be discussed in the near future at a meeting in Paris of representatives of the Governments of the Union of Soviet socialist republics, the United States, the United Kingdom and France.XVI.-The Black Sea Straits.The three Governments recognised that the Convention concluded at Montreuxshould be revised as failing to meet present-day conditions.It was agreed that, as the next step, the&quot; matter should be the subject of direct conversations between each of the three Governments and the TurkishGovernment.XVII. International Inland Waterways.The Conference considered a proposal of the United States Delegation onthis subject and agreed to refer it for consideration to the forthcoming meetineof the Council of Foreign Ministers in London.XYIII. European Inland Transport Conference.The British and United States Delegations to the Conference informed the jSoviet Delegation of the desire of the British and United States Governments toreconvene the European Inland Transport Conference ence, and stated that they would welcome an assurance that the Soviet Government would participate in the workof the reconvened conference. The Soviet Government agreed that it would participate in this conference.
XIX. Directives to Military Commanders on Allied Control council for Germany.The three Governments agreed that each would send a directive to its repre-sentative on the Control Council for Germany informing him of all decisions ofthe Conference affecting matters within the scope of his duties.XX. Use of Allied Property for Satellite Reparations or &quot;War Trophies.&quot;The proposal (Annex II) presented by the United States Delegation was accepted in principle by the Conference, but the drafting of an agreement on thematter was left to be worked out through diplomatic channels.XXI. Military Talks.During the Conference there were meetings between the Chiefs of Staff ofthe three Governments on military matters of common interest.(Signed) J. V. STALIN.HARRY  S.  TRUMAN.C. R. ATTLEE.Berlin, 2nd August, 1945.ANNEX I.Text of a. Letter Transmitted on 12th July to the Representatives of theUnited States and United Kingdom Governments on the Allied control commission in Hungary.&quot; In view of the changed situation in connection with the termination ofthe war against Germany, the Soviet Government finds it necessary to establish the following order of work for the Allied Control Commission in Hungary : 1.

ANNEX II.1. The burden of reparation and &quot; war trophies &quot; should not fall on allied nationals.2. Capital Equipment. We object to the renewal of such Allied propertyas reparations, &quot; war trophies,&quot; or under any other guise. Loss would accrue to allied nationals as a result of destruction of plants and the consequent loss of markets and trading connections. Seizure of Allied property makes impossiblethe fulfilment by the satellite of its obligation under the armistice to restore intactthe rights and interests of the Allied Nations and their nationals.The United States looks to the other -occupying Powers for the return of anyequipment already removed and the cessation of removals. Where such equipment will not or cannot be returned, the United States will demand of the satelliteadequate, effective and prompt compensation to American nationals, and that such compensation have priority equal to that of the reparations payment.These principles apply to all property wholly or substantially owned by allied nationals. In the event of removals of property in which the American as wellas the entire Allied interest is less than substantial, the United States expectsadequate, effective, and prompt compensation.3. Current Production. While the United States does not oppose repara-tion out of current production of Allied investments, the satellite must provideimmediate and adequate compensation to the Allied nationals including sufficientforeign exchange or products so that they can recover reasonable foreign currencyexpenditures and transfer a reasonable return on their investment. such compensation must also have equal priority with reparations.We deem it essential that the satellites do not conclude treaties, agreementsor arrangements which deny to Allied nationals access, on equal terms, to their trade, raw materials and industry; and appropriately modify any existing arrangements which may have that effect.
