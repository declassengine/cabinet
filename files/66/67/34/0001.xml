L.S.A,18th July 1945,appendix extract from Note 2 recording proceedings of the SimlaConferenceAzad, who spoke for the Congress, covered much the sameground as he had covered at his interview with the Viceroyon 24th June,   He said -X XXX X X X(5) that although Defence would remain under theCommander-in-Chief, the Indian Army must become a real national army;(6) that while the Congress would wholeheartedly supportthe war effort against Japan, they must be satisfiedthat the liberated countries in South East Asia wouldnot remain in subjection; and(7) that Congress were not clear about the relationsbetween the Government of India and the Indian  .States if the Indian States were entirely a matter for the Crown Representative:.,

The Viceroy said he was not quite clear on theCongress views about the Indian Amy (Azad&apos;s point (5)).No Government could permit its army to take part in politics.   The Indian Army had done splendidly during thewar and had enhanced its own and India5s reputation.   He&quot;believed it to he a contented army and he thought the delegates did not realise what rapid progress had &quot;beenmade with Indianization during the war.   He would certain!oppose any suggestion that the Indian Army should he brought into politics.   On the other hand he wished it tobe a truly national army efficient and contented.The Viceroy explained that the future of the occupied territories in South East Asia (Azad&apos;s point (6)) was amatter in which several Governments were interested.   TheGovernment of India would be entitled to express any viewsthey please4 but could not expect to have the last word.Azad (point 7) had referred to relations with themdian States.   The Viceroy explained that the Governmentof India are in close relations with the Indian Statese.g. on commercial and economic matters.   But unless a federal constitution embracing both British IndianProvinces and States were introduced, there could be noquestion of a.Central Government exercising controlover the States,

Alternatives are to say nothing, or to write personally to Asad and if necessary to other leaders.    X prefer first alternative unless statement is repeated and detailedcontradiction is unavoidable;,  in which case 1 would write toAsa&amp;a    But you will appreciate that once correspondence beginsI shall be forced to argue every point in public which is undesirable.
