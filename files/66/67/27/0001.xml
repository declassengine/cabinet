Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1945.secret. Copy No.CP. (45) 77.12th July, 1945.CABINET.CELEBRATION OF ARMISTICE DAY.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.UNTIL 1939 it was customary for Armistice Day, the 11th November, to becelebrated by the holding of a special service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall at11 a.m. and for the holding of local services at that hour generally throughoutthe country. When Armistice Day did not fall on a Sunday, the Sundayimmediately following Armistice Day was generally observed as RemembranceSunday. The 11th November, except when it fell on a Sunday, was the day on whichpoppies were sold for the funds of the British Legion. During the war the holding of services at 11 a.m. on the morning of the 11th November was abandoned because of the importance of avoiding the congregation of crowds,in pursuance of the Government1 s policy of dispersal with a view to minimisingthe possibility of casualties in air raids.The question now arises whether on Sunday, the 11th November next, we shallrevert to the pre-war practice of a ceremony at the Cenotaph attended by The King,Members of the Royal Family, and the Cabinet, the High Commissioners andthe heads of the Fighting Services. I think it would be the general wish once again publicly to observe the two minutes&apos; silence, and to have it associatedwith services of remembrance. I would propose, therefore, if my colleagues agree, to take The King&apos;s Pleasure as to the revival of the ceremony at theCenotaph on the 11th November, 1945.Shortly after VE-day, my predecessor received a deputation, led by the bishop of Winchester, representing the Church of England, and including representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, the Free Church Federal Counciland the British Legion. The deputation raised the question of the future of armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday after the Avar.The deputation expressed the view that it was undesirable that there shouldbe more than one Remembrance Day after the end of the present war, and they suggested the desirability of adopting one day as Remembrance Day in com-memoration of two national deliverances and of the fallen in both of the wars.The 11th November and the Sunday following it are already well established in the United Kingdom and to a large extent throughout the commonwealth and Empire; and the British Legion have a special interest in the observance of Armistice Day. The objections to the adoption of the 11th November asRemembrance Day for both wars are the uncertainty of the weather at this time of the year and the fact that the November Sunday tends to collide withCivic Sunday, which follows the election of new Mayors. Furthermore, unlessthe end of the Japanese war takes place some time in November, it would beunreal to remember on the 11th November (a day hitherto associated with the defeat of Germany in 1918) the much greater and more widespread sacrificesmade during the present war. The deputation accordingly suggested that a date should be fixed in some other part of the year, possibly in May. TheBritish Legion were strongly in favour of the adoption of one national day asa clay of remembrance in respect of both wars and of the maintenance of theCenotaph as the national memorial for both wars. They were very anxious inparticular that the two minutes&apos; silence ceremonial should be resumed.My predecessor told the deputation that he favoured one national day ofremembrance associated with a national service of remembrance at the Cenotaph.The matter Avas, however, one for the Cabinet to decide and they Avere not likely[30215]
to take a decision before the end of hostilities. Mr. xvxorrison said that hewould like to see the day linked with some real historic event, following the precedent of the 11th November; that might be either VE-day or VA-day. Until,however, a new national day , had been officially fixed, the observance ofthe 11th November should, he thought, continue.The Bishop of Winchester suggested that at some time nearer November apublic statement should be made that, for this year at any rate, the 11th Novemberwould be celebrated as Armistice Day, pending the choice of a new nationalclay. I have carefully considered the representations made by the deputation and have come to the conclusion that (1) there should not be separate days of remembrance for the two wars;(2) it would not be appropriate to appoint the 11th November as the dayof remembrance for the two wars;(3) when the Japanese war is over a day should be appointed as the NationalDay of Remembrance;(4) it would be desirable to make such an announcement as that suggestedby the Bishop of Winchester.Accordingly, I recommend that, should The King approve the holding ofthe Armistice Day service at the Cenotaph on the 11th November next, thepreliminary announcements should make it clear that, although Armistice Daywill be celebrated on the usual lines this year as a day of remembrance for thosewho have fallen in both wars, consideration would be given, after the terminationof the Japanese war, to the fixing of some other date as a national day ofremembrance on which those who had fallen in the two wars would be honouredand remembered.D.
