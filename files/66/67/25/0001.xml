THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC SSAJESTY&apos;3 GOYERNMEHTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 75.11th July, 1945.CABINET.REDISTRIBUTION OF MAN-POWER IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1945.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.AT the Cabinet Meeting on Friday, the 6th July, Cabinet (11) 45,1 expressedthe view that it was improbable that more than 10 squadrons of the &quot;V .L.R. force could be deployed, and that there might, therefore, be corresponding savings ofman-power both in the aircraft industry and in the Air Force. The PrimeMinister, summing up the discussion, said that I &quot;might provisionally assume the V.L.R. Force would not exceed 10 squadrons.&quot;2. I have caused further enquiries to be made on this point. I find thatthe British Chiefs of Staff, with the Prime Minister&apos;s approval, have made a firm proposal to the United States Chiefs of Staff to send a force of 20 squadrons to participate in the strategic bombing of Japan, and that the United StatesChiefs of Staff have accepted the first 10 squadrons of this force and have saidthat they would welcome the remainder of the force when conditions warrant.3. It would be very inadvisable to go back on this decision in view of ourrelations with the Americans, especially since our original contribution was planned at a much higher rate. It would also have a bad effect upon our present negotiations with the Canadians, as to their contribution to both the first and second groups, if any doubt were now thrown upon our intentions.4.   I am, therefore, looking for other ways of easing the man-power situation.H. M.Air Ministry, 11th July, 1945.[30208]
