(45) 64.5th July, 1945.CABINET.PEACE TREATY WITH ITALY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE United States Government have been anxious for some time to termination-nate the Armistice regime in Italy. Whilst we want to work as closely as possible with the Americans over Italy, we do not like the American idea of a preliminaryPeace Treaty which would confer immediate benefits upon Italy but leave asidesuch important questions as frontiers, the future of the Italian colonies and thedisposal of the Italian Fleet. In our view penalties must be imposed at the sametime as the benefits are conferred and we have therefore proposed to the UnitedStates Government that a final Peace Treaty should be concluded once hostilities with Germany are over and in advance of the Peace Settlement with Germany.The preliminary reactions of the State Department have been favourable, butin order to show that this is a serious proposal it is desirable particularly now that Germany has in fact surrendered that we should communicate to the UnitedStates Government within the next few weeks our ideas on the contents of sucha Peace Treaty. I accordingly circulate* herewith a skeleton draft of the politicalclauses, which subject to the Committee&apos;s approval would form the basis of thediscussions with the Americans. The military, naval and air clauses and theeconomic and financial provisions are under examination by the Chiefs of staff and E.I.P.S. respectively and will be submitted for Ministerial approval in due course.Procedure.2. The Peace Treaty must be concluded between Italy on the one hand andall the United Nations who are in a state of war with Italy on the other whofor the purposes of the Treaty might be referred to collectively as &quot;the Asso-ciated Powers.&quot; The preparation of the terms to be presented to Italy will thus be a lengthy process. The programme I have in mind is to communicate ourideas, after consultation with the Dominions, to the Americans and to try toreach agreement in Washington on an Anglo-American draft. This draft wouldthen be discussed with the Russians and the French and, once their agreement has been secured, with the other United Nations who have a primary interest inthe Italian settlement: Greece, Yugoslavia and Abyssinia. The concurrence ofthe other United Nations would then be sought. Only on the completion of such consultation could negotiations with the Italians actually begin, though it maywell be desirable at some earlier moment to inform the Italian Government thatwe are prepared to conclude peace with them. The interval between such a noti-fication and the opening of negotiations should, however, be as short as possible.* Annex.[30103]1!
23. In a number of places in the Treaty it will be necessary to confer on afew United Nations&apos; Governments the power to settle the points which will inevitably be left unsettled in the Treaty; e.g,, certain territories and certainspoils of war will be surrendered by Italy, kit their ultimate allocation willhave to be left for later decision. In the peace treaties concluded after the last war such powers were conferred on the Principal Allied and Associated Powers.In this case I would propose that this responsibility should be laid on the UnitedKingdom, United States, Soviet and French Governments who might conveniently be described as &quot;the Four Powers.&quot; For the purposes of the European provi-sions, both the Greek and Yugoslav Governments may be expected to advanceclaims to be included, but I think such claims should be resisted and that the big Four alone should act as trustees. For &quot;the purposes of the African provisionsthe inclusion of the Soviet Government is inconvenient, but I think it would bedifficult to exclude them.General Character of the Treaty.4. Our aim is to arrive at a final settlement with Italy. It will not in every case be possible to settle in the Treaty the extent or the future of the territories which Italy is called upon to cede or the exact allocation as between the united nations of the reparation which Italy will be called on to make; but we can andshould ensure that Italy&apos;s assent to the final decision is obtained in advance.5. There is an inevitable conflict in our approach to Italy. On the one hand we desire that a democratic Italy purged of Fascism should be restored as quickly as possible to the position of a useful and prosperous European State, and shouldbe given a reasonable chance of livelihood and economic development in order toprevent her from going Communist and falling under Russian influence. Inview, moreover, of Italy&apos;s geographical position we shall desire to maintainfriendly relations with her, and welcome her as a member of any western european system that emerges after the war. Our interest in a friendly andcontented Italy is accentuated by the present trend of Russian policy in europe and Tito&apos;s recent behaviour.6. On the other hand, there can be no question of admitting any longerItaly&apos;s pretences to be a Great Power. It is necessary to prove both to Italy andto the world that aggression does not pay, and Italy must accordingly makeretribution for her past behaviour and her participation in the war on the sideof Germany.7. The Peace Treaty ought thus to provide for the surrender by Italy of territory both metropolitan and overseas, for a measure of disarmament and for reparation for her past aggression. But these provisions should not be carriedto the lengths of endangering the internal stability or economy of the country.We should, moreover, pay due regard to Italian susceptibilities in matters of form, and encourage her readmission to the comity of nations by facilitating heradmission to United Nations organisations.Terr it or ial P rov isions.8. Italy must recognise the independence of Ethiopia and Albania andrenounce the special position she enjoyed in those countries in the past. the dodecanese should eventually be given to Greece with the exception of Castelrosso,which ought probably to go to Turkey. Zara and the A driatic Islands off the dalmatian coast can go to Yugoslavia. All these territories, however, shouldnot be given outright to the ultimate recipients, since this would provide Yugo-slavia with a precedent for claiming Venezia Giulia (see paragraph 11 below)at once, but they should be ceded by Italy to the &quot; Four Powers.&apos;&apos; The Chiefs ofStaff are anxious that the islands of Pantellaria, Lampedusa and Linosa shouldon security grounds not revert to full Italian sovereignty. Their cession by Italy is accordingly provided for and one solution might be to deal with them later on in the same way as the Japanese islands in the Pacific. From the point ofview of our future relations with Italy, however, it would be preferable to includethese Italian islands in some scheme which would allow Italy to administer them under suitable international supervision, as proposed in paragraph 12 below inthe case of Tripolitania. France may put forward claims for minor frontier-rectifications near Briancon and Ventimiglia for strategic reasons. I see noreason to object to this but I consider that we should resist the further claim which the French may put forward for the Val d&apos;Aosta.
9.   The territorial changes mentioned above are comparatively straight-forward but there are three further major and very contentious issues : South Tyrol.10. The southern half of this territory, the province of Trento, is Italian-speaking and should clearly remain Italian. The acquisition by Italy in 1919 ofthe northern half, the province of Bolzano, was a questionable decision and wehave to consider whether it ought now to be reversed. The issues are set out in a paper circulated to the A.P.W. Committee by the Minister of State last year(A.P.W. (44) 16) and the A.P.W. Committee then approved the Minister ofState&apos;s recommendation that we should not rule out the later return to Austriaof the northern and German-speaking half. The arguments are very evenly balanced. The 1919 decision was taken on strategic grounds and the Brenneris undoubtedly the better strategic frontier; but the northern boundary of theTrento province, the Salorno line, wTould still leave Italy with a good defensiveposition. The industrialisation carried out by the Italians in Bolzano hasstrengthened the economic links between the province and the rest of Italy andthe maintenance of the existing frontier would thus cause the least economicdislocation; but if the frontier were to be changed, such dislocation would not be serious, given goodwill between the two countries. We do not know -how far thearrangements agreed between Hitler and Mussolini in 1939 for the transfer of population were carried out or how far they may have been reversed as a resultof German control since 1943. Probably the population of Bolzano remainspredominantly German. The decision in fact is really one of high policy : havewe more to gain, on the long-term view, by avoiding the further humiliation ofItaly or by satisfying Austrian aspirations? I incline to the first alternative.The acquisition of Bolzano cannot be said to be indispensable to a &quot; free and *independent Austria&quot; to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed, andit might on the other hand be a source of.danger in the event of Austria fallingunder purely Russian influence. I have, therefore, made no provision for thedisposal of this area in the draft heads. I would propose, however, that our negotiators in Washington should explain our views on this subject to the americans. If the latter felt strongly that the question should be decideddifferently or be kept open, we might consider inserting draft provisions on the pattern of those applicable to Trieste and Venezia Giulia (see paragraphs 8 to 10of Annex).Trieste and Venezia Giulia.11. The conflicting claims of Italy and Yugoslavia in this area present oneof the most difficult territorial questions which will have to be settled after thewar. It is generally recognised that the 1920 frontier was unfair to Yugoslavia,but there can equally be no question of admitting the extreme Yugoslav claims which extend not only to the entire province but to portions of Italy proper. any settlement which deprived Italy of Trieste and the predominantly Italian areasin Gorizia and at the mouth of the Isonzo would cause bitter feeling in Italy.The right solution thus seems to be to provide in the Treaty for the cession by italy of the whole area tying between the 1914 and 1920 frontiers in favour of theFour Powers who in clue course would decide what was to be the future Italo-Yugoslav frontier, allocating the territory to the east of the line to yugoslavia and returning the territory to the west of the line to Italy. Unless it is decidedto give Trieste an international status this city would be included in the westernportion, though doubtless certain conditions should be attached, in the way of free zones, trade concessions and facilities, to its return to Italy. In the north-western corner of the disputed territory there is a triangle around Tarvis whichmight eventually be returned to Austria.Italian Colonies.12. The Italian Empire was the product of strategic calculation and Italy&apos;spretensions to be a Great Power. We have a strategic interest in preventingItaly&apos;s return to the Reel Sea area and the future security of the Mediterraneanwill probably require the establishment of United Nations bases and facilities in the former Italian territories in North Africa. The restoration of Italianrule in any of these territories would be unpopular with the inhabitants and theArab world generally. Moreover, by depriving Italy of these territories whicheconomically are liabilities we shall not be causing any serious injury to her[30103] . b 2
economic life. It will probably be decided to place these territories under Inter-national Trusteeship, but until that conception has been defined it is impossibleto consider its practical application to individual territories. In the Treaty wecan thus only provide for the cession by Italy of all these territories in favour ofthe Four Powers who will decide their future in clue course. As part of thosefuture arrangements Italy might well be awarded the rights of administrationover Tripolitania.13. If the Committee approve, I propose that attached Heads of treaty should be communicated (i) to the Dominion Governments with a request for their urgentobservations;(ii) to the United States Government.A.
