IE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 61.3rd July, 1945.CABINET.MAN-POWER.Note by the Prime Minister.THE Man-power Committee have drawn attention (CP. (45) 53) to the severe shortage of man-power available for civilian industry; and they considerthat one of the most effective means of helping to meet this shortage will be toincrease substantially the numbers of women to be released from the Services,They have suggested that a total of 135,000 women should be released during thesecond half of 1945.2. I am in favour of this recommendation, but I clo not think it goes far enough. In principle, I think that arrangements ought to be made to release from the Women&apos;s Services at the earliest date all women who clo not wish tocontinue in those Services.3. I suggest that the Man-power Committee should be asked to review the irrecommendation on this matter in consultation with the Service Ministers. Asa start they might consider whether they could not increase to 250,000 the target figure for the number of women to be released from the Services in the second half of 1945.w. s. c.10 downing  Street, S.IV. 1,3rd July, 1945.
