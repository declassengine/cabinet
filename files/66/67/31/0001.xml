Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 81.\Uh July, 1945.CROPPING DIRECTIONS AND PRICES OF CERTAIN agricultural commodities FOR 1946 HARVEST.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.AT the meeting on the 7th March, 1945, the Lord Presidents Committee(L.P. (45) 13th Meeting) agreed to a memorandum (L.P. (45) 55) about the pricesof the principal agricultural commodities for 1945 and 1946, subject to a review at a later date of the possibility of relaxing directions to grow wheat, rye,potatoes and sugar beet for the 1946 harvest. In that event it was agreed thatthere should be certain reductions in the acreage payments and prices applicableto these crops.2. It is now necessary to decide and inform the farming community whatlevel of production of these crops is to be expected for 1946 and whethercompulsory directions to grow the necessary acreages will be continued for afurther year.3. Consultations have taken place with the Ministry of Food and theTreasury. As my colleagues know, the general world food situation has deteriorated since the agricultural programme for 1946 was considered inFebruary and March last. The Ministry of Food have now- asked that theAgricultural Departments should take the necessary steps to maintain next year the 1945 acreage for sugar beet, i.e., 400,000 acres, and for potatoes an acreageof about 1,280,000 acres in the United Kingdom, i.e., not more than 10 per cent,below the estimated 1945 figure. For wheat they would wish to obtain anacreage of 2\ million in the United Kingdom, which is slightly more than theestimated acreage this year following a very bad sewing season last winter, butconsiderably less than the figure of 3-2 million acres in 1944 or than the originaltarget of 2-8 million acres for this year. In view of the expectations generallyheld out of a prospective relaxation of cropping directions, it is not going to be easy to attain these figures.4. I agree that there is a good case for maintaining by directions approxi-mately the existing production of potatoes and sugar beet in 1946, and in that event there can be no change in the present acreage payment and prices of potatoes and the price of sugar beet. Wheat is, however, in a different category.World supplies are large and by the crop year 1946-47 there should be somerecovery in European production and more possibilities of importing whatever isrequired to supplement the home crop.5. There is, however, a much stronger reason for relaxing compulsorydirection to grow wheat and at the same time reducing the acreage payment by  2 per acre as was contemplated in March last. It is very important from the stand-point of long-term agricultural policy that we should begin next year a downwardmovement in agricultural prices and the accompanying relaxation of control ofcropping, even though there may be some risk that we shall not achieve the fullacreage of wheat desired by the Ministry of Food. Unless this downward move-ment is started for a key commodity like wheat, there is a decided risk of further pressure from the Workers&apos; Unions for increased wages, which it would be muchmore difficult to resist unless we have started on the downward path for prices.[30234]
Without directions some of the farmers on marginal land in the Western partof the country will undoubtedly grow less wheat and although there may be somerecovery of the wheat acreage in the Eastern and Midland counties we shall stillseek to maintain the total tillage area with the aid of directions I cannotguarantee that the Ministry of Food&apos;s target will be attained. It may be that thewheat acreage in 1946 will be no more than 2^ million acres, although I shall make every endeavour by persuasion and propaganda to get as near as possible to the desired target.6. Any fall in the wheat acreage would be offset by a larger production offodder crops, which should assist in the revival of pig and poultry production thathas already been set on foot. It is an open question whether such a change mightnot be more to the national advantage.I would therefore seek the authority of the Cabinet to (i) maintain for a further year approximately the current year&apos;s acreages of potatoes and sugar beet by compulsory directions, with the corollary ofno change in the present acreage payments and prices for these crops,(ii) relax compulsory directions for wheat and reduce the acreage paymentfrom  4 to  2 per acre as originally proposed, but make every endeavour by persuasion to secure not less than 2-J million acres; and(iii) treat rye, which is of much less significance, on the same lines as wheat.My colleagues will of course realise that the attainment of those targetsdepends on the maintenance of an adequate labour supply.R. S. H.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1,lQth July, 1945.
