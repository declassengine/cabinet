This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty?s Governme.ntPrinted for the Cabinet, July, 1945SECRET /Copy/No.      0CP. (45) 69 i  /gth July, 1945. 1/cabinet war GRAVES ON GERMAN SOILMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I have had a letter addressed to me as Chairman of the Imperial War graves commission by the Secretary, Major-General Sir Fabian Ware, saying that at their meeting on 17th May, the Commission had under consideration the policy to be followed in dealing with requests from next-of-kin that bodies of officers and men of His Majesty&apos;forces buried overseas should be returned to their home countries for burial.This policy, as is well known, was rejected in 1918, and the task of repatriatingbodies would, I understand, be even greater now than it was then, for, though thenumbers are fewer, the graves are more widely scattered and the shipping situationmore difficult.The Commission, therefore, wish to adhere to the present policy and they agreed to approach the participating Governments to secure their approval and support. they regard the matter as urgent and consider an early announcement most desirable.2. No repatriation of bodies of members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces to home countries from abroad has been allowed during the present war, and I am not in favour of making any change, more especially as I believe that the representatives of the dominions on the Imperial War Graves Commission are recommending to their governments that no change should be made. I, therefore, ask the approval of the Cabinet to myreplying to Sir Fabian Ware in this sense.3. As to burials in liberated European countries, the policy so far has been thesame as that adopted in France and Belgium during the last war, viz., British plots in local cemeteries and British military cemeteries in those areas where moderately severefighting has taken place, isolated graves being concentrated in the nearest militarycemetery.4. As to burials in Germany, the question arises whether, even if bodies are notrepatriated to their own countries, all the graves should be concentrated in countrieswest of the Rhine.5. It is as yet too early to be able to give an estimate of the number of graves inGermany.   They will, however, fall into three main groups:  (a) graves of those killed during recent operations: the main area in which Britishdead are to be found is between the Rivers Maas and Rhine, though thereare, of course, a great many scattered graves elesewhere;(b) graves of those who have died as prisoners of war: these graves, which include those of all Dominions and all Services, are scattered throughout Germany ;(c) graves of air-crews, both British and Dominion, killed in air operations over germany: these again are scattered all over the country.6. The arguments in favour of concentrating the graves of our dead in countrieswest of the Rhine are as follows:  (a) It is understood from Canadian Army sources (though I have no confirmationfrom the Canadian Government) that there will be no Canadian permanentcemeteries sited in Germany. I believe also that this is to be the policy ofthe United States, French and Belgian Governments.(b) There is undoubtedly a body of opinion in this country which would be againstleaving the bodies of our men in German soil.(c) It will be impossible for some time to give facilities to the Imperial War graves commission for civilian gardeners and maintenance staff to operate inGermany proper.
gth July, 1945.(B45/67)   no   7/15   VV.O.P.   22916(d) It will also be impossible, for a long time to come, to grant facilities for next-Of-kin to visit graves in Germany, particularly east of the Rhine.(e) At any rate, it will be desirable to bring bodies out of the Russian occupiedzone for burial where the graves can be maintained under British super-vision.7. The arguments in favour of allowing permanent cemeteries in Germany properare as follows:   .(a) There are already several British cemeteries in Germany from the last war,including one in Berlin. Judging by the enemy&apos;s treatment of our cemeteriesof the last war in France, Belgium and Germany, it does not appear thatwe need fear any difficulty in ultimately being able to maintain themproperly.(b) There is a body of opinion in this country which considers that the sight ofBritish war cemeteries is Germany would have a salutary effect on the peopleof that country.(c) To remove all graves out of Germany, or at least west of the Rhine, wouldinvolve, in many cases, very long hauls. The ordinary concentration, underoperational conditions, of isolated graves into nearby cemeteries is done inblankets or hessian sheets. It is probable that the movement of bodiesthrough Germany could be done by night in this manner, but if the con-centration were to be in cemeteries in France, Holland or Belgium, we shouldbe faced with a demand for putting the bodies into coffins which would entail a.very considerable demand for both labour and material.(d) To remove all graves out of Germany would probably start a demand for theremoval of graves out of other enemy or ex-enemy territories, e.g., Austria,the Balkans and even Italy. We may ultimately also have similar difficultiesin the Far East.(e) Lastly, and of great importance, is the argument that if we once accede towholesale concentration over such distances, we open the door to demands from next-of-kin for the repatriation of bodies to the United Kingdom.8. Weighing up these considerations, I suggest that, in principle, the decision shouldbe in favour of graves being concentrated in suitable military cemeteries in the generalareas in which the men fell, irrespective of whether these are or are not in the british zone of occupation, or whether east or west of the Rhine.9. To sum up, I invite my colleagues to approve:  0) of my replying to the Imperial War Graves Commission in the sense ofparagraph 2 above.(b) the policy for concentrating graves in military cemeteries in Germany suggestedin paragraph 8 above.
