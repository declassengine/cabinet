Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 88.2Qth July, 1945.CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE 1945 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.ALTHOUGH the Liberals have been returned with a reduced number of seats in the General Election, they will still be able to count confidently on a workingmajority in the House of Commons, as the Independent Liberals in Quebec, andsome of the other Independent members, can be relied on to vote with the Govern-ment on any major issue.2. A comparison of the present composition of the House with that beforethe General Election shows that the Liberals hold 118 seats as compared with 155;the Progressive Conservatives 66 as compared with 40; and the C.C.F. 29 ascompared with 10.  The main support for the Liberal party has come from Quebec.3. With the rise of Nationalist parties in that Province, and the hostilitywhich greeted the Governments partial acceptance of conscription for service overseas last autumn, it had seemed possible that Quebec might turn from itstraditional loyalty to Liberalism in favour of a narrow provincial sectionalism.But the result showed otherwise. The Bloc Populaire, the extreme &apos;; nationalistgroup in Quebec, secured only two seats. The Conservatives, with only two seats,and the OOF. party with none, made little showing in the Province, and the liberals swept the board with 47 Government candidates elected, and 10 more,who ran as Independents or Independent Liberals, have since rallied to theGovernment.4. The Liberal predominance in Quebec, is partly paralleled by theConservative hold in Ontario, for. though the Progressive Conservative partysecured a general increase of strength, the party success in Ontario is out of all proportion to its position in other Provinces. The strongly marked differentiation between Provinces is manifested also in the prairies, where Saskatchewan andAlberta have given the OOF. and the Social Credit parties respectively the bulkof their representation in the Tlouse.5. Mr. Mackenzie King (who was elected bv a narrow margin in the civilianvote) was defeated when the service vote was included, but no difficulty is expectedto be encountered in finding him a new seat,6. Parliament will open on the 23rd August. The Prime Minister has indicated that there will be no immediate changes in the Cabinet, and thatGeneral McNaughton, who was defeated in the election, will continue as Ministerof Defence for the present. The post of Postmaster-General, which was leftvacant by the resignation of Mr. Mulock, 1ms not yet been filled.7. A Dominion-Provincial conference will open in Ottawa on the 6th Augustfor a. preliminary session at which proposals for the future relationship of theFederal and Provincial Governments will be submitted.[30258] copy No.
8. Plans for Canadian particpation in the war with Japan are now takingshape. It has been announced that the Canadian Navy will send a force of60 Canadian warships to operate with the Royal Navy. Of the total force of30,000 men required by the Canadian Army for the Pacific war, practically thetotal number have already volunteered. The Royal Canadian Air Force estimatetheir requirements for the Pacific war, for an occupation force in Europe, andfor training centres in Canada, at approximately 100,000 men.9. Major-Genera! the Honourable L. R. La Fleche, D.S.O., former Ministerof National War Services, has been appointed Canadian Minister to Greece withthe personal rank of Ambassador.Service A activities.10. H.M.C. Ships Lauzon and St. Lambert (frigates) were involved in acollision in the early part of the month while escorting an Atlantic convoy. the st. Lambert was damaged but remained seaworthy.11. On the 14th and 15th H.M.C.S. Uganda (cruiser) took part in operationscarried out by the British Pacific Fleet against Truk.12.   The First Canadian Army under  Command of 21st Army Group,continued to carry out occupational duties in North-Western Europe.13. A total of thirty-two R.C.A.F. Squadrons were operational during june, of which ten were located in the United Kingdom, nineteen on theContinent, one in Italy and two in Burma.14. Of the three R.C.A.F. Dakota Squadrons in Transport Command, two were located in Burma and one on the Continent. These Squadrons flew a totalof 4,932 sorties totalling 11,015 operational hours for the loss of 1 aircraft whichis missing from operations in Burma.15. During the month all the aircraft of the eight R.C.A.F. Heavy bomber squadrons of Bomber Command earmarked to return to Canada completed the move. These eight Squadrons are now undergoing extensive training programmes in preparation for future operations in other theatres of war.16. The two R.C.A.F. Sunderland Squadrons of Coastal Command wereearmarked for transfer to Transport Command with effect from the 7th of next month and are to be re-equipped with long-range transport aircraft.17. During the month the following R.C.A.F. Squadrons were disbanded :No. 401 Squadron and No. 410 Mosquito Squadron, both of the Second tactical air Force, and No. 407 Wellington Squadron, of Coastal Command.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.18. There was a lively debate in Parliament on the Commonwealth BankBill, the.main point of contention being the provision abolishing the Bank Boardand the reinstitution of control of the Bank by a Governor solely responsible tothe Commonwealth Treasurer. The chief speaker against the new control was mr. W. M. Hughes, who was a Minister in the Labour Government whichestablished the Commpnwealth Bank in 1911. After much discussion the Billfinally passed all the stages in the House of Representatives, and the House isnow considering a second Banking Bill for making permanent the war-timecontrol of trading banks.19. The Governments Re-establishment and Employment Bill to providepreference for ex-servicemen for&apos; seven years after the war,&apos; had a long and livelypassage through the House of Representatives, and it is receiving similar treat-ment by Opposition members in the Senate who have been trying to secure absolutepreference for soldiers on the lines of that given after the war of 1914-1918. TheOpposition was, however, defeated on. party lines.20. The Child Endowment Bill, increasing the endowment from 5.?. to7.v. Qd. weekly, and the Bill to increase Invalid and Old Age Pensions from 27s.weekly to 32.?. Qd. have passed all stages in the House of Representatives.21. It is reported that price control will be one of the most importantitems to be discussed at the Premiers&apos; Conference in August, and a FederalMinister has stated that the Commonwealth would ask the States to refer all
price control powers to the Federal Government. If this is refused, the Common-wealth would probably ask for such powers by referendum at the Election nextyear.22. Official figures for Australian exports (most of which were to GreatBritain) for the year ended the 30th June, 1944, which have just been published,show that these amounted to more than 2 million tons, and included 1 - 3 million tons of cereals, 100,000 tons of meat, and 50,000 tons of dairy products.23. Exceptionally heavy rains in the early part of June caused, seriousfloods in New South Wales, resulting in loss of life and extensive damage to stockand property. There are indications that the long drought from which Australiahas suffered is breaking throughout practically all the Southern part of theContinent.24. The Labour Party Conference held during the third week of Juneresulted in control passing to the Communist section, and, in consequence, to animmediate demand for compulsory Trade Unionism by regulation; increase of basic wages; and a 50 per cent, increase in pensions. The press suggests thatthese developments may wreck the official Labour Party.25. Flis Majesty The King has approved of the appointment of admiral sir Hugh Binney, K.C.B., D.S.O., to be Governor of Tasmania in succession toSir Ernest Clark, whose extended period of Office expires in August.Service A activities.26. Previous to the landings on the 10th of the month in Brunei Bay(North-West Borneo) H.M.A. Ships Hobarl (Cruiser) and A runta (Destroyer)took part in the preliminary bombardment with United States ships, whileCommandos of the Royal Australian Navy also participated in the landings.27. In New Guinea troops of the Sixth Australian Division made progressduring the month in evicting the Japanese from positions over-looking Australianbase developments in the Wewak area. Fierce resistance was encountered duringthe course of these operations, but despite this, Mount Tazaki, a dominatingfeature, five miles South-East of the town, was captured on the 22nd, and furtheradvances subsequently made.28. On Bougainville Island, troops of the Third Australian Division, with two additional Brigades under command, have been actively engaged in opera-tions during the month. In the south, good progress has been made along theBuin road in the area of Runai (30 miles North-West Buin), where, in the face ofincreasing Japanese resistance, two rivers have been crossed and firm positionsestablished on a front of three miles on either side of the road. In the centre ofthe Island long-range patrols have harassed the enemy in the Numa Numa area,and some progress has also been made in the area east of the Torokina Perimeter.To the north, several minor encounters have taken place, with the Japanese trying to break out of the Bonis Peninsula, and Australian troops making a smalllanding on the west coast of the Peninsula, where several enemy positions were captured.29. In New Britain the position remains unchanged, with troops of the fifth Australian Division occupying areas as previously reported.30. In Borneo, troops of the Ninth Australian Division landed on LabuanIsland, Muara Island and on the Brunei Peninsula on the 10th of the month. the towns of Labuan and Brunei, together with two airfields were captured by the14th, and on the 20th, further landings were made at Lutong in Sarawak, and atMempakul in British North Borneo. These various landings have since linked up along this sector of the coast.31. Liberator Squadrons of the R.A.A.F., operating in the S.W.P.A., flew250 sorties without loss to drop over 470 tons of bombs in support of the groundoperations in Borneo.32. R.A.A.F. Beaufort Squadrons flew 631 sorties, when over 350 tons were dropped on targets in the Wewak and Maprik areas of New Guinea.33. Six Kittyhawk Squadrons, comprising No. 78 and 81 Wings of theR.A.A.F. operating in support of Australian Army Forces on Borneo, claimed[30258] * b 2
five enemy aircraft destroyed, one damaged and seven probably damaged, all onthe ground, for the loss of one Australian aircraft during this period.34. No. 80 Wing of the R.A.A.F. made up of three Spitfire Squadrons, flew over 100 sorties without loss over the Hal manor as Islands, to claim four enemy aircraft damaged on the ground.35. R.A.A.F. Beaufighter Squadrons of No. 77 Wing, flew 163 sorties and dropped 73 tons while attacking opportunity targets during the Borneo landings.NEW ZEALAND.36. The Governor-General opened the New Zealand Parliament on the27th June. In the course of his speech, he announced the Governments intentionof introducing a measure to provide for the acquisition by the State of the pri-vately-owned shares in the Bank of New Zealand, and also that legislation wasunder consideration for the Government to acquire and operate the internalcommercial air services of New Zealand.37. Another point of interest in the speech was the statement that, inaddition to maintaining New Zealand&apos;s- contribution to the military effort, full account must be given to her capacity to produce food, not only for the Pacificforces, but also for maintaining supplies to Britain, and helping peoples of the liberated territories. It seemed likely that the -production of meat and dairyproduce for the present season would exceed the two objectives aimed at.38. There have been increasing demands in the Press for the Governmentto reach and announce a decision in regard to New Zealand&apos;s part in the Pacificwar. and the consequent allocation of man-power which it would entail. Mr. Nash,Minister of Finance, said that New Zealand would continue to participate inthe Pacific war by maintaining a small land force, and would continue naval andair activities. Men would have to be brought back from Europe to help in thejDroduction of foodstuffs, and he added that twenty thousand New Zealand troops from the Middle East, and seven thousand released prisoners of war, were to comehome as soon as ships could be obtained. The Minister of Defence stated that anew assignment for the R.N.Z.A.E. had been allotted whereby some units wouldbe employed in closer contact with the Australian Army. R.N.Z.A.F. CommandHeadquarters would be amalgamated by the abolition of the division between theSouth and South-West Pacific zones, and the new task force would become responsible not only for operational but also for administration and supplvcontrol.39.   The 1945 Victory Loan of  N.Z. 45 millions, was oversubscribed.Service A cticities.40. H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles (Cruiser) formed part of the British Pacific Fleet-operating against Truk on the 14th and 15th of the month.41. In Italy the Second New Zealand Division, under Command eighth army, carried out occupational duties in the Trieste area and along the &quot; MorganLine.&quot; which is the boundary between Allied and Yugoslav zones.42. Co-ordinated&apos; reports for the month of June regarding R.N.Z.A.F.activities in the Pacific area have not yet been received, the following reviewtherefore only covers Article XV Squadron operating in the western hemisphere.43. No. 489 R.N.Z.A.F. Squadron started to re-equip with Mosquitos duringthe course of the month while No. 490 Sunclerland Squadron, formerly stationed in West Africa, has been disbanded, thus leaving four R.N.Z.A.F. Article XVSquadrons, in addition to No. 75 R.A.F. Squadron manned by New Zealandpersonnel operating in this area.CNION OF SOUTH AFRICA44. On leaving San Francisco Field-Marshal Smuts paid a visit to Ottawabefore returning to London. He lias since proceeded to Italy. Owing to theheavy strain on certain Ministers it is expected that there will be a reshuffle ofportfolios among the present Ministers after the Prime Ministers return to south Africa.  Meanwhile, opposition papers claim that Mr. Hofmeyr, Minister
of Finance, Mr. Steyn, and Mr. Conroy have been manoeuvring for place aseventual successor to the Prime Minister,&apos;and in this connexion the view has been expressed that Mr. Ffofmeyer did not show up well as Deputy Leader during thepast session.45. The interim report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry under theChairmanship of Mr. Justice Broome into matters affecting the Indian populationof. the Natal recommends that the Union Government should invite the Govern-ment of India to send a delegation, composed substantially of Indians, to theUnion to discuss the position, of Indians in South Africa. This proposal has,generally speaking, had a good press. The new High Commissioner for India,Mr. R. M. Deshukh, made reference to this report in his first public speech since his arrival in South Africa, at an official reception in Durban, and supported theidea that a delegation from India should visit South Africa. He described thereport as showing that a redefinition of Indian status may yet be achieved, and added that, with representation based on the franchise, many of the problemsbesetting the Indian community would disappear.46. During the past month, opposition parties in South Africa have beenbusy organising an anti-Communist Crusade, and there has also been an inten-sified campaign in the Nationalist Press to stir up sentiment against the dangers of a &quot;black republic&apos;.&apos; in the Union. The &quot;League for the Protection ofEuropean Workers,&quot; which was formed a year ago under the protection of theDutch Reformed Church, for the purpose of drawing the urban Afrikaner workersaway from the regular Trades Unions, lias been resuscitated.47. The latest development in the &quot; Crusade &quot; is an announcement byDr. Malan, the Opposition Leader, that the Nationalist Party will hold a specialUnion Congress in Johannesburg on the 18th Seotember to consider the Com-munist danger and the fight against it. Pro-Government, papers have asked wnyDr. Malan did not call a special Congress when Europe was being engulfed byNazism, and they conclude that his campaign is not really directed againstCommunism, but, as in previous election preparations, against the native and coloured population of South Africa. In this connexion, Mr. Oswald Pirow hasbeen trying to stage a comeback by changing his &quot; New Order &quot; plan into an anti-Communist one.48. Since its inception in September 1941. the South African Medical aid for Russia Fund has collected  800,000.Service A activities.49. H.M.S.A.S. Barbrake and H.M.S.A.S. Salvestor (Salvage vessel) formed part of the British East Indies Fleet during the period under review.50. H.M.S.A. Ships Goodhope and Natal (Frigates) arrived in the union on their way to the Far East, while H.M.S.A.S. Transvaal (Frigate) was commis-sioned on the Clyde on the 14th May. Two other Frigates, H.M.S. Teviot andanother of His Majesty&apos;s Frigates which is still to be designated, are to be manned by S.A.N.F. personnel, but will remain as H.M. Ships.51. The Royal Navy has decided to withdraw all H.M. Trawlers operating under S.A.N.F. control at Durban and Cape Town, and to this end eight S.A.N.F.Whalers on loan to the Royal Navy and forming the Third and Fourth EscortGroups have reverted to S.A.N.F. control.52. The Sixth South African Armoured Division continued to carry outoccupational duties in the area of Turin and along the French-Italian border.EIRE.53. Mr. Sean T. O&apos;Kelly, former Deputy Prime Minister and Ministerfor Finance, has been elected as President in succession to Dr. Douglas Hyde,and assumed office on the 25th June for a period, of seven years.54. A Presidential Standard has been inaugurated. Its design is a goldharp on a background of St. Patrick&apos;s blue.55. Mr. Lemass, Ministry for Supplies, has been appointed Deputy PrimeMinister, and Mr. Aiken Minister for Finance, to fill the vacancies caused by the selection of Mr, O&apos;Kelly to the Presidency.
56. The Minister for Industry and Commerce lias announced that a detailed study of the possibilities of internal air services in Eire has been made, but that so far no economically justifiable scheme has been found practicable.57. Eire observed the 29th June, which had been set aside by Mr. de valera and the Catholic hierarchy as a day of thanksgiving for the preservation of Eirefrom war and for the restoration of peace in Europe, as a day of rest and prayer.Economic.58. A Bill is being introduced to wind up the Department of Supplies andto transfer its functions to the Ministry for Industry and Commerce.59. For the four months January to April imports were valued at 10,506,463 as compared with  9,847,951. in the same period last year. Exportstotalled  10,555,996 as against  9,381,287 for the same period in 1944.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.60. Simultaneously with the announcement made in Parliament on the14th June the Viceroy broadcast in India the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment for the reconstruction of his Executive Council on a basis more representa-tive of organised political opinion and announced his intention to invite repre-sentative political leaders, both all-India and Provincial, to a conference on the25th June in order to discuss the formation of the new Council, which he indicatedwould include equal proportions of caste Hindus and Moslems. At the same time he announced that the members of the Congress Working Committee still in detention were being released forthwith. He explained that the main task, thatof securing agreement on a new permanent constitution, still lay ahead : thepresent proposals, which would operate within the existing constitution, were ofan interim character only, but he believed they weie a stride forward in theright direction.61. The Viceroy&apos;s broadcast was favourably received in most quarters inIndia, and tribute was paid to his sincerity and sympathy. There was evidentlywidespread relief that His .Majesty&apos;s Government had at last made a positivemove to break the prolonged deadlock and critics found reason for satisfactionin the proposals themselves, though voices of protest were heard from the HinduMahasabha against the proposals for the representation of caste Hindus, andfrom the Scheduled Castes, alleging inadequate representation of their large population. After some difficult negotiation with Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnahthe Viceroy was successful in assembling the Conference on the proposed date.62. The progress of the discussions soon revealed that communal antagonismwas the root difficulty in the way of an agreement, and that the main obstaclewas. on the one side, the claim of Mr. Jinnah that the Moslem League should nominate all the Moslem members of the Council, and on the other the claim of Congress as a non-communal organisation to nominate Moslem as well as tlindu(and indeed any other) members. This conflict was not resolved by the 29th Junewhen the Viceroy adjourned the Conference in the absence of agreement untilthe 14th July, and invited the several interests in the Conference to submit tohim in a week&apos;s time the panel of names from which he would make his selection.There the matter rested at the end of June. It was apparent that Indiahoped for a successful issue to the Conference and pressure was being put on theleaders from various quarters not to let it fail.Frontier and Foreign Refections.63.   The North-West Frontier remained quiet.64.   Tibet and the North-East Frontier. The National Assembly of Tibethave lodged a protest concerning the action of the Government of India in taking      )control of the areas immediately south of the McMahon Line, which was agreed with the Tibetans in. 1914 as the Indo-Tibetan frontier, and demanded thewithdrawal of all troops from these areas.   The Government of India have
recommended that this demand should not be accepted, and that the successor-designate to the post of Political Officer, Sikkim, should be instructed (as thenormal channel of communication with the Tibetan Government) to inform thatGovernment of the legal and diplomatic basis for the action viz., the SimlaConvention of 1914.65. Mr. Shen, the Chinese representative, is still at Lhasa, and is knownto have spent much money on the monastic party, which, dominates the national assembly.66. Nepal. Rumours about the impending abdication of the Maharaja,Sir Joodha Shumshere, have now been confirmed to His Majesty&apos;s Minister byhis son. If Sir Joodha&apos;s health permits, the occasion may await the return ofthe contingent of the Nepalese Army now serving against the Japanese.67. The next in the line of succession, Sir Padma Shumshere, isCommander-in-Chief of the Nepalese Army and is understood to appreciate fully the importance of the British - connection as do all the senior members of the ruling family.Economic68. (a) Food. His Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken to load wheat for India at the rate of 100,000 tons a month for the six months beginning July,and have authorised a public announcement of this undertaking by the Govern-ment of India. This is the British share in an arrangement of which the Indianpart is an undertaking to hnd 290,000 additional tons of groundnuts for theMinistry of Food (making 500,000 tons from India in all) and to provide25,000 tons of rice for Ceylon during the next few months.69. In India itself the wheat harvest has been reasonably good in the punjab and United Provinces, though the outturn in Sind appears to bedisappointing. It is to be hoped that the announcement of continued importsat a high rate will greatly assist the procurement of wheat for the deficit areas from the three main surplus provinces.70. The food position in India as a whole can never be free from anxietyso long as bulk import of rice from Burma is not available for the deficit areas inthe West and South and as a resort in case of crop failure elsewhere. Apart,however, from local troubles in regard to rice in Western and Southern Indiaand from the exhaustion of the wheat reserve at Karachi (which should be remedied by the higher imports now provided for), the overall position was reasonably satisfactory during June. In particular, the rice position in EasternIndia had so far improved that the Governor of Bengal was able to announce the provision of 100,000 tons of rice from Bengal for allocation to deficiency areasin India and to provide rice for Ceylon against ultimate replacement from elsewhere.71. (b) General. The issue for the 1st June of the Indian TradeBulletin is a special &apos;&apos; Victory-in-Europe&apos;&apos; number, and gives a brief andgraphic conspectus of India&apos;s contribution to the war so far, on the industrialside.   The following passages are extracted from among many other items72. Industrial Research for the War Effort. The Board of Scientific andIndustrial Research has been engaged during the war on industrial research.. . . . Some of the research  activities carried on by the Board were : the use ofvegetable oils as lubricants; the preparation of plastic materials, chiefly from certain products available in the country; the economic disposal of molasses; themanufacture of sulphur; the preparation of dyestuffs, particularly dyestuffsfrom vegetable products; the manufacture of certain drugs: investigating thepossibilities of making scientific instruments; work in regard to metal and alloys;research regarding glasses and refractories; investigating the possibility of manufacturing internal combustion engines in this country; the manufacture ofgraphite and carbon electrodes; and the production of rayon and cellulose fromi&apos;aw materials available in the country. *73. Weapons- India&apos;s ordnance factories .... manufactured machine-guns, modern field-guns, bombs, mines and depth charges. They turned outvarious new types of small arms ammunition, gun ammunition and explosives,shells, anti-tank mines, anti-personnel mines and smoke generators, two types ofhowitzers, gun carriages and trailers, light machine-guns, shells and propellants.
The civil workshops maintained a constant output of the many components which make up these-projectiles.74. Textile Industry. Wartime annual exports of cloth at one timeamounted to more than 800 million yards as against 200 million yards in the pre-war period.....An important item, produced by the industry was anti-gasfabric.   Another important item was tentage, for which 53 new producingfactories were established.....Parachutes, both silk and cotton, were maninfactured in India. In 1944, their manufacture increased seven-fold. In March1943 over 12 million tailored items of clothing Avere made.75. - Timber. Indian timber has been extensively used for the load-carryingbodies of army vehicles, for shipbuilding, for the construction of country craft and for many&quot; other purposes.   From 242,000 tons in 1940-41.....the figure for timber production rose to 1,274,000 tons in 1943-44.76. Chemicals. Soda ash, caustic soda, bleaching powder,, chlorine, sodiumand potassium bichromates, chromic acid, sodium thiosulphate and calciumchloride, are some of the more important chemicals now produced in largequantities which were produced only on a very small scale or not at all before thewar.77. Mica. India&apos;s 70-year-old mica industry has produced the largestquantity of mica for the United Nations.78. Posts and Telegraphs. The Department completed the greater part of avast construction programme, reckoned to cost over Rs. 160 million, for the pro-vision of telegraph and telephone carrier channels between the main centres inIndia and for the extensive line communication required by the Defence Services.Some 110,000 miles of wire and nearly 10,000 miles of new routes were laid.79. Railways. Since the war began, over 1,400 miles of military sidingshave been constructed. Other works of an engineering nature, such as increasingthe line capacity and sidings to military depots and airfields, have also been constructed. In all, some 3,500 track miles have been arranged. Railway mate-rial for overseas theatres of war was also sent. The supplies consisted of loco-motives, coaching stock and wagons, besides vast quantities of track, turnouts,crossings, and turn-tables, and miscellaneous railway stores.80. Reciprocal Aid. India is giving Reciprocal Aid to American forces stationed in India. The goods and services relating to this aid take, broadly speaking, the following three main forms : (1) Reciprocal Aid to United Statesfences in India in the shape of rations, clothing, ordnance and other stores, theconstruction of accommodation, airfields and.connected works and the provisionof transportation, communications and maintenance facilities of various kinds;(2) Reciprocal Aid to United States shipping using Indian ports, in the shape of port dues of all kinds, ship repairs, &amp;c; and (3) available raw materials and available foodstuffs, such as tea, required by the United States Government directlyfor war purposes.....The amount of Reciprocal Aid which India has rendered to the United States is about Rs. 1,240 million from the beginning of the war upto the end of 1944-45.81. Aid to Russia. Over 5,000 tons of vital war material were sent from india to Russia during the first six months of 1944. Russia has received gunnybags, tossa canvas, jute ropes, tea, pepper, tin, wolfram, silk, shellac and hides.Array, Navy and. Air Force Activities.82.   Royal Indian Navy. Nothing to report.83. Military: Burma. The weather during the month was of no assistanceto either side. The main areas of activity were in the Pegu Yomas, North-west of Pegu and on the Toungoo-Mawchi road, which snakes its wav through junglecovered mountains towards the Thailand border.84.-Our troops continued to advance slowly along this road cracking deter-mined Japanese resistance by outflanking movements. In the Pegu Yomas theenemy, who had withdrawn from the area of the Prome-Rangoon. railway, com-pletecl their reorganisation and commenced attempts to break out eastwards overthe Sittang. Up to the end of the month under report these attempts had. failedwith considerable casualties to the enemy.
85. Minor offensive action was taken by the Japanese in the Mokpalin area,East of Pegu, with the object of creating a diversion to assist the escape of thosein the Pegu Yomas.86. In the North, in the Kalaw sector, a heartening change took place, andour troops made rapid progress eastwards.87. Meantime the reorganisation of the Japanese troops who were east of the Sittang river continued in the        of Bilin.88. There is widespread dacoity in Burma, but police measures are generallyeffective having regard to the incomplete Police Forces in districts more recentlyliberated.89. By flying in rice to the worst deficit areas in liberated Burma theBritish Military Administration averted the threat of famine, which at one timeappeared serious.90. Air.-There was a further decrease in Army air support operations duevery largely to the bad flying conditions and to the fact that heavy ram frequentlyrendered airfields unserviceable. Nevertheless a number of successful air strikeswere reported and were of great value in assisting the Allied Land Forces.91. A 10,000-ton tanker was sunk by Liberator bombers in the Gulf of Siam.This was the largest enemy merchant vessel seen in those waters for some months.Sunderlands on armed reconnaissance sank and damaged a number of barges and a motor vessel. River craft on the Sittang river were attacked by other aircraft.92. Fairly frequent photographic cover was obtained of the Tenasserimcoast ports and of the Burma-Siaih railway line.93. D.D.T. spraying of Rangoon was held up by bad weather. The pro-gramme at Akyab was practically completed.General.94. Morale, British Troops. Repatriation appears to be the predominantthought to the practical exclusion of all other subjects. There has been a notice-able increase in pessimistic comment regarding the future of Anglo-American-Soviet relations. The announcement of the new campaign medals has had a mixedreception.95. Morale, Indian Troops. Increasing attention has been focussed on post-war economic problems. Reports have indicated that the majority of Indiansoldiers are not looking forward to release as they are doubtful of post-war condi-tions as compared with the present financial stability.96. Leave ex-Burma. Between the 20th May and the 6th June, 14,700 menwere moved from Rangoon for leave in India.   They were flown to Chittagong.97. Reading matter. During the month 67,500 books were received anddistributed in S.E.A.C.98. Recovered Indian Army Prisoners of War.

Enemy-Occupied Burma. There are no important developments toreport.100.   Liberated Burma. Lawlessness is widespread and includes Chinesedeserters in the North and a number of armed dacoits as was inevitable in viewof the general accumulation of arms amongst the population.   Some elements of[30258] c
the B.N.A. are still out of hand and are reported to be alarming villagers andintimidating public servants from reporting for duty, while posing as liberatorsand as rivals to the Government of Burma.101. Aung San, Commander of the B.N.A., and Than Thun, Minister for agriculture under the Japanese, have assured Admiral Mountbatten of thegenuine desire of the Anti-Fascist Organisation to co-operate wholeheartedlywith the military administration. Plans are now going ahead for the gradualdisbandment of the &quot; Patriot Burmese Forces&quot; and for the registration andenlistment of volunteers into suitable units of the Burma Army.102. The Governor of Burma held a successful meeting with prominentBurmese leaders in HATS. Cumberland in&quot; Rangoon river. His object was tomeet representative Burmans and explain to them His Majesty&apos;s governments intentions as embodied in the recent statement of policy.103. From detailed reports received, a large proportion of the buildings inRangoon have suffered little structurally, though most have been stripped of theirfittings. A fair number of inland water transport vessels have been recovered,but few of these are powered vessels. The movement of supplies in Burma is stillmuch hampered by lack of transport, but 100 tons a day air lift is being devotedto frying rice to the worst deficit areas. The number of rice mills working inRangoon and Shwebo area are increasing and there is estimated to be a paddysurplus in Toungoo and Pegu.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic A ffairs.Food Supplies.104. Ceylon. The Government of India, having now received the necessaryassurances regarding wheat to be supplied to India over the next six months,have now agreed to release to Ceylon, on loan, 25.000 tons rice for shipmentduring July and August. This quantity, together with the allocations expectedto be received from Egypt and Brazil, should enable the present ration to bemaintained throughout the second half of this year.105. Ceylon Copra Prices. Mr. Corea, Minister for Labour, commerce and Industry in the Ceylon Government, has recently concluded a visit to thiscountry for the purpose of discussing the price paid by the Ministry of Food forcopra purchased from Ceylon. As a result of these discussions it has been agreedto raise the price of Ceylon copra to cover increased costs of production. Thef.o.b. price paid by the Ministry of Food will in future be  29 15s. 0d., ascompared with the previous overall price of  22 5s. lid. a ton. This latter figureincluded a special bonus received by the Ceylon producers in respect of sales toIndia, which is now absorbed in the Ministry of Foochs price.Defence.106. Arrangements are being made for the return of the 81st West AfricanDivision from the Far East to West Africa as shipping permits. The movementwill be at the rate of approximately 2,000 men per month in the period July toDecember 1945, but it is hoped that the monthly flow will be considerably increased in 1946.107. The return of the Caribbean Regiment from the Middle East to theWest Indies has been decided on as there is now no operational role for it in theMiddle East or the Mediterranean. The date of return has not yet been decidedand is dependent on the availability of shipping.108. Borneo. Three landings were made by Australian troops on the10th June in the Brunei Bay area and on Labuaii Island.   Opposition on the
whole was very light. Labuan is now clear of the enemy except for the south-west tip. Brunei town has been captured and troops have pushed south-west to take Tutong and Seria, and have also advanced southwards in to Sarawrak totake Limbone.109. On the 23rd June a further landing was made at Lutong and advanceshave been made to the south to capture Miri and the oil-fields, and northwardsto the Baram River. Two further landings were made without opposition enthe 24th June north-east of Mempakul to the north of Brunei Bay.110. In the Brunei area the condition of riverside natives is reported to be fair. There is a shortage of food inland, but the position is not serious. Thereis a general acute scarcity of clothes, fishing tackle and lighting. Javaneselabourers impressed by the Japanese are in an appalling state. Nativeinhabitants are reported to be overjoyed to see the Australians. In the Labuanarea the food and medical position is satisfactory.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.111. Both Arabs and Jews watched developments in the Levant states with close concern. The Arabs, whose mood had veered against Britain as theresult partly of Zionist political campaigning since VE-day and partly of agita-tion on behalf of the Mufti, applauded British intervention. The Jews, whose attitude was initially non-committal, subsequently veered towards sympathy with france and deprecated British support for Arab Nationalist aspirations. TheJewish press consistently featured the French case and showed apprehensionlest success of Arab Nationalism in Syria might encourage further intransigenceover Palestine. An attempt has been made to feature Arab anti-Semiticactivities in Syria, presumably with the object of preparing the ground for anexodus of Jews from the Levant States to Palestine. In fact, during the month,some 100 illegal immigrants, mostly children, were caught crossing the northern frontier.   Their eventual disposal is under consideration.112. Arab interest in the San Francisco Conference was subordinated tothe proceedings of the Council of the Arab League in Cairo and to a deplorableexhibition of personal feuds and party intrigue.113. Failure to secure political representation at San Francisco, or large scale immigration outside the terms of the White Paper, has provoked criticism of the Jewish Agency&apos;s handling of affairs, and dissension is likely to become more widespread unless some turn in events can be represented as a victory forthe Agency policy. Public opinion on the immigration question is being system-atically worked up by articles in the Jewish press and by utterances of Jewishleaders. It is clear that, unless large scale immigration is legalised, the Agencyis prepared to resort to illegal immigration. The recent appointment by thePalestine Government of an ad hoc departmental committee to investigate allegation&apos;-tions of fraudulent evasion of the Land Sales Regulations, has been represented as indicating that the White Paper will continue to guide policy for some timeto come.114. Activity by the Irgun Zvai Leumi (National Military Organisation)has continued. Mortars apparently aimed at the route of the King&apos;s Birthdayparade were discovered on the 12th June; on the following day, information fromthe Jewish Agency led to the discovery of a, similar battery aimed in the directionof the saluting base. Substantial quantities of gelignite were stolen fromquarries by motorised parties of Jews on the night of the 17th / 18th June.115. Police anti-terrorist measures continued and included 78 raids.Sixty-eight persons were detained. The total number detained on the 20th June,was 464.   Nine mortars with 9 mortar projectiles were seized.116. Cereal crop prospects in Palestine and Trans-Jordan are very good.A locust invasion has been successfully checked and barley is nowr being offeredat the lowest price for four years. The Syrian crisis has barely affected theeconomic situation.[30258Jd
West Indies.(1) Federation.117. The West India Royal Commission recommended that whilst federation was not an appropriate means of meeting the pressing needs of the West Indies,it was the end towards which policy should be directed. After prior consultationwith the Governors of the Colonies concerned, I recently addressed a despatch tothem, which has now been published, stating that while existing differences between the West Indian Colonies would make it impracticable to set upimmediately a federal organisation, I considered that the aim of British policy should be the development of federation in the Caribbean at such time as thebalance of opinion in the various Colonies is in favour of a change, and when thedevelopment of communications makes it administratively practicable. Theultimate aim of any federation which might be established would be full internal self-government within the British Colonies.118. I asked that an early opportunity should be taken to obtain the opinions of Colonial Legislatures by arranging for each of them to debate the issue ofO J O      CD mfederation and that if they weie then to declare themselves in favour of it, aconference of West Indian delegates might be held later to consider the formula-tion of proposals for such closer association as might be immediately practicable and desirable.119. The initial reaction of most of the West Indian press lias so far been favourable.(2) Anglo-American Caribbean Commission.120. It was announced on the 30th June that the Commission had beenexpanded to provide for four members on both the American and British side.This will make it possible to appoint two British West Indian unofficials to theCommission and so meet the demand, with which I have fully sympathised, for the closer association of unofficial opinion with the Commission^ work.121. It is proposed that the British unofficial delegates to the next west indian Conference, who will themselves be elected by the unofficial members of colonial Legislatures, should themselves decide the method of selection of theWest Indian unofficials appointed to the Commission, and, if that is their decision,proceed with the selection.Nigeria.Strike of Technical Workers.122. On the 22nd June, the African technical workers and labourersemployed by the main Government departments, including the Railway, Marine,Public Works and Printing Departments, as well as the employees of LagosMunicipal Council, came out on strike. The Union to which the men belongedhad been negotiating with the Government for increases in basic wage rates andin cost of living allowances. The Government had refused to grant such increases,pointing out that they would only result in an inflationary spiral rise in prices.As an alternative measure to combat the admittedly increased cost of living, steps have been taken to extend the existing Government scheme for marketing staplefoodstuffs at controlled prices; and increased supplies of other food are beingimported by the Government into Lagos, the centre most affected.123. The Union leaders agreed to act in accordance with the procedureprescribed under the Defence Regulations and to declare a trade dispute. Themen, however, repudiated the action of these leaders (who subsequently resigned)and came out on strike. The strike is so far confined to technical workers;Government clerical staff and the employees of all but two commercial firms have remained at work. Emergency services are in operation and, according to thelatest reports, there have been no civil disturbances to date.   The strike continues.Gibraltar.124. Sir Findlater Stewart has now presented an interim report on theproblems involved in the repatriation of the Gibraltarian evacuees remaining in Northern Ireland. He has strongly recommended the establishment of atemporary camp at Tangier to house up to 2,000 for two years; and estimates that,
JL    ^if this is rapidly put in hand, only a few hundred Gibraltarians will be left inthe United Kingdom after the winter.125. The number of Gibraltarian evacuees in Northern Ireland has nowbeen reduced to 4,500 and repatriation continues. The last Gibraltarian evacueesin Madeira will have been repatriated before the end of this month.Higher Education.126. The Commission which I appointed in August 1943, under the Chair-manship of Sir Cyril Asquith, to consider the principles which should guide the promotion of higher education, learning and research, and the development of universities, in the Colonies, has now presented its report.127. I hope that this report, and also the report of the Commission, with colonel Walter Elliot as Chairman, which has been considering the problems of higher Education in West Africa, and the report of a Committee, under sir James Irvine&apos;s Chairmanship, which has reported on similar problems as theyaffect the Caribbean Colonies, will be published as Command Papers about themiddle of July.Nursing Services.128. I have just received the report of the Committee which, under theChairmanship of Lord Rushcliffe, has been considering the training of nurses forthe Colonies.A aviation.British West Indian A irways.129. I reported in August last that agreement had been given in principle to the payment of a subsidy to the Company to enable it to expand its services inthe Caribbean area and that discussions were then proceeding as to the conditions on which the payment would be made. Since then, there has been serious deterioration in the financial position of the Company, which indicates that somereorganisation may be necessary if the subsidy is to be economically applied. Ihave, therefore, with the concurrence of the Minister of Civil Aviation, arranged for Group Captain Dismore of Transport Command, who was formerly AssistantGeneral Manager of Imperial Airways, to proceed to Trinidad to investigate andreport on the Company&apos;s affairs. Group Captain Dismore is expected to leave forTrinidad early in July.
