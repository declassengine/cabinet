(45) 56.2%d July, 1945.CABINET.IMPERIAL  SECURITY  IN  THE  MIDDLE  EAST :   LOCATION  OFBRITISH TROOPS AND VALUE OF LOCAL FORCES.Note by the Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister, the annexed memorandum by theMinister Resident in the Middle East is circulated for the consideration of theCabinet.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd July, 1945.MEMORANDUM.The memorandum approved by the Middle East Defence Committee (see cp. (45) 55) does not deal with two subjects of political as well as military importance, namely, the location of British troops and the possible value oflooally-recruited forces. Having during my residence here formed certain strongimpressions on both those subjects, I would like to comment briefly on them.Location of British Forces.2. It is obviously desirable, so far as possible, to locate British troopswhere they will cause the least political inconvenience and carry the maximumpolitical value. It is also expedient that all further building expenditure should,so far as possible, be concentrated on sites which are certain to be permanentlyoccupied. Both these desiderata involve major decisions which will inevitablyraise difficulties; but the sooner they can be taken, the better for British influence in this region and for the over-burdened British taxpayer.3. On the question of location, I desire to emphasise the great political importance of Cyprus and Palestine. Both must be solidly garrisoned if theyare to remain under British administration without endless political trouble andwasteful emergency expenditure. It is of the first moment to our security in theMiddle East that British administration should continue unshaken in both ofthem. I hope, therefore, that of the seven divisions which are, I understand, tobe allotted to this region, two will be posted in Palestine and one in Cyprus, if,as I believe, this disposition of force is feasible without material damage to either country. The military view of Cyprus as site for a division appears tohe unfavourable; but I trust that it may be reconsidered. Cyprus is only toolikely to prove politically untenable if our determination to hold it against bothexternal threat and internal agitation is not made manifest to its population bythe presence of a powerful though friendly British garrison.[30115]
24. Of the remaining four divisions it may be politically feasible to post one in Egypt and one in Transjordan; but this is very uncertain. On present indications it will not be possible to post any in Iraq, Syria or the Lebanon.Transjordan I deal with later (see paragraphs 10-13 below). As to Egypt, itmay not be easy to secure consent to a stronger garrison of the Canal Zone thanthe existing Treaty allows (10,000 men in all). It may also be held by our defenceauthorities that the value of a main naval base at Alexandria and of widespreadair facilities (which are not in the existing Treaty at all) outweighs that of aBritish division permanently posted on Egyptian soil. Local ground defence ofthe Canal Zone will, of course, be indispensable: but it may prove expedient toprovide for that in a different manner (see paragraph 14). If so, there mustassuredly be a British division within easy call.5. All these considerations give cumulative importance to our status inCvrenaica. If the Cabinet on deliberation approve what I have said in the last four paragraphs, the number of divisions which can be posted in the central terri-tories of the Middle East will be five at the maximum, and may come down to four or even three. If, then, the contemplated strength of seven divisions (three, Iunderstand, as local garrison and four in strategic reserve) is to be stationed- within the strategic area of the Middle East, it seems that a minimum of two anda possible maximum of four must be held in the perimeter. It is possible, I gather, that a suitable station for one or two of these may be found in East Africa.But whether that proves feasible or not, there is no escape so far as I can see fromthe conclusion that military bases and facilities must be obtained in Cyrenaica,where the Royal Air Force in any event attaches great importance to the Flump.Our military administration there has clone admirable work, so that Ruler and people alike are most friendly to us; but we shall lose our best officers there if some decision regarding their future conditions of service is not made at an early date.The fate of Cyrenaica presumably depends on international agreement. It istherefore of great importance that our position there should be established by whatever method may best assort with our responsibility for the security of theMiddle East under the new world order.6. The importance of having that role assigned to us unequivocally by theWorld Security Council cannot be exaggerated. The case for the British empire in the Middle East is stated in the main paper. But the primacy of Britain in theMiddle East is also of great moment to America and to all who wish for freedom in our sense to prevail. The Middle Eastern countries cannot protect themselvesor raise the condition of their peoples without the help of the great liberal Powers.They must fall into one of-two orbits, either that of the great Western Powers or else that of Russian Britahrs is unquestionably the helping hand they mostdesire. She can, I believe, best give them the guidance and security they need,provided she has the moral support of the Dominions and the full co-operationof America. This is also, I am convinced, the belief of thinking men in the middle eastern States themselves who can see their countries in true perspective againstthe world. The peoples, on the other hand, are densely ignorant, stronglynationalist in sentiment with little sense of their dependence on foreign aid, and always ready to attribute to foreigners the innumerable evils of the society into which they are born. Such good leaders as they have (and these are few) will therefore be faced with constant trouble in working with us, however much they desire to do so; and we must ease their task, as the main paper suggests, by under-standing of their difficulties.7. The surest way of doing this, when it comes to bases and other such facilities, is to be enabled to call upon them as partners in a regional securitysystem forming part of the new world order in which Britain takes the lead andbears the main burden as the chosen representative of the United Nations in thispart of the world. I trust that Britain&apos;s claim to that role will be understood andsteadily supported in America; for if the liberal views of human needs for whichthe Empire and the American Union stand cannot hold their own in this, the strategic centre of so many historic rivalries, they will, I am convinced, be shakento their foundations everywhere.The Possible Value of Local Forces.8. There is another aspect of this principle of partnership which will, Ibelieve, repay close study. In Palestine we have to work for the creation of a peaceful bi-racial State and to deal with the problem presented by the Haganaor Jewish army.  In Cyprus we have to persuade a population which is four-fifths
of Greek descent that continued union with Britain will better meet their needs and sentiments than union with what they regard as their motherland. In Egyptthe local defence of the Suez Canal Zone may well be easier to assure if it isregarded as a joint responsibility to be discharged in close partnership by theBritish and Egyptian peoples. From the political standpoint, the question is how a true sense of partnership may best be created and developed. I believe thatour military organisation can help considerably towards that end.9. In the main paper the value of co-operation and regular combinedexercises with local forces has been strongly emphasised. Most of these-in Egypt,for instance, and Iraq will be forces raised, officered, paid for and controlled by the Governments of the independent territories concerned. But it may, i submit, be well worth our while to consider the organisation of local forces of adifferent kind, namely, forces raised and paid for by His Majesty&apos;s Government,containing an admixture of British and local officers, but under British command.The Transjordan Arab Legion is a model in many ways of what I have in mind,though the British Officer commanding it, Brigadier Glubb, is subject to the Amir.A brief description of the character and record of the Arab Legion will thereforeserve to illustrate the nature, purpose and potential value of similar forces whichwe might raise elsewhere.10. Transjordan stands apart amongst the Arab States as a country whosepopulation has always been solidly pro-British. It has never yet suffered from internal unrest; it refused to give either help or comfort to the Arab rebellionin 1936-39, when gangs from other Arab countries were constantly raiding into palestine; it is the only Arab State which has actually fought on our side in this war. In April 1941 Britain was at her lowest ebb in this part of the world.Rommel was advancing upon Egypt; the Germans had driven us out of greece and were attacking Crete; they also controlled Syria, and Iraq had declared war on us. The Bagdad radio was broadcasting the most moving and fanatical appealsto all Arabs to rise and drive out the British, the friends of Zionism. Trans-jordan stood firm and sent her Arab Legion to fight against other Arabs in iraq and Syria by our side. One of its detachments was actually first across the Tigris.It raided here and there and by a happy chance shot up the Governor of Bagdadin his car, thus giving the impression that the road from Bagdad to the northwas strongly occupied. By contrast the Transjordan Frontier Force in Palestinemutinied and refused to fight. The difference between the two forces is a strikingexample of what good leadership can do. The commander and British officersof the Legion, mixed with Arab officers, were of the very best. The troops hadabsolute confidence that in fighting with us under those officers they were fightingfor the independence of their own land. I have visited the Mechanised brigade of the Legion and was deeply impressed by its esprit cle corps. Its splendidconduct in 1941 was certainly one of the chief factors in turning a closelybalanced scale.11. We owe the signal loyalty of Transjordan in the first place to HisHighness the Amir. He has never wavered in his devotion to us, as all Rulersin the Middle East except those of his family have clone, and the value of hisfriendship is hard to over-estimate. But he has been most ably seconded by theBritish Officers in the country especially Mr. Kirkbride, the British Resident(whose hand is in everything but never seen), and Brigadier Glubb, the commander of the Legion. These men are known throughout the country and personallytrusted everywhere. It is a stimulating experience to drop into one of Trans-jordan&apos;s fortified (and often ancient Roman) farms and share the welcome whichis given them. We have, I believe, in Transjordan and its Arab Legion an example which, might, mutatis mutandis, be followed with equal profit elsewhere possibly in the Suez Canal Zone, probably in Cyprus, certainly in Palestine.There is no lack of Englishmen who can do these things for us;&apos; it is generallyimagination or understanding in Whitehall that fails. Transjordan, for instance,the only Arab State which actually fought on our side in this war, was also theonly Arab State which was not allowed to send representatives to the san francisco Conference. Whatever the technical reasons, why must such thingsbe done ?1.2. I trust that another act of inconsiderateness may not be laid to ourcharge, such as the disbanding of the Arab Legion after the war. It can alwayschoose from a surplus of recruits; it is doing some excellent education in a country where schooling is much in demand; and it would never. I am convinced, fail usin emergency unless we ourselves by some act of madness lost the confidence of the
Amir and his most virile people, who want nothing more than to strengthen theirties with us and profit by our aid. It is possible that a British division might besuitably stationed in Transjordan and welcomed there. The Arab Legion wouldcertainly find much pride and emulation in training with British troops. Thepossibility, however, requires closer reconnaissance than has yet been done. Whatis more certainly feasible is that the British divisions in Palestine should do partof their training in Transjordan, instead of Syria and the Lebanon. This would serve the same purpose, so far as the Arab Legion is concerned.13. It will be said, with justice, that we have made the most of local forcesin India and many Colonies. Certainly the services of the Indian Army and ofmany Colonial contingents cannot be overpraised. Burma and Malaya, on theother hand, are cases where cur imagination failed. But those examples^ are notparallels to what I have in mind. We have for the most part raised admirablelocal forces where they could be paid for in peace time from local revenues. Thelocal forces which I have in mind here would have to be paid for by the British tax payer; the men composing them would also have to be educated during their service and well looked after when their service was clone. It is here that strong-objections come in. British troops are, of course, the best of all; they are equallyserviceable everywhere, and we never have enough of them. Why, it may wellbe said, take money which might be spent on them for local forces of lower value which can only be used in a limited way ? My answer is that the association with us in a common defence scheme of local forces commanded, trained andeducated by British officers (with local officers, so far as possible, intermixed),working in emulation with British troops when combined exercises can bearranged, and inspired by the knowledge that they are sharing with us in defenceof their own land, can do more than anything else to create that sense of partner-ship with the Empire and confidence in its aims which will be indispensable tous in maintaining the security of the Middle East. Their military value wouldbe much less than that of British soldiers, but by comparison their cost [ier unitwould be low. If it were ever possible to invest the men who form such forces and prove their worth in them with some honorific sign of common citizenshipin addition to and in expansion of the nationality to which they belong, thatpurpose might be still better served. I am always haunted by the feeling that the roman Empire at its best was wiser in these matters than we have been.14. In Palestine the special object would be to facilitate the transfer ofthe Hagana or Jewish Army to British control and to associate Arab and Jewishunits in common service, mixing Arab and Jewish officers with British ones undera British higher command. In Cyprus it would be to give young Cypriots a pridein themselves and in service to their country in place of a largely factitiousinsistence on the ties of race which will be dangerous both for us and them, ifmuch further indulged. In Egypt it would-be to establish the closest possiblepartnership in the various forces required for the defence of the Suez Canal Zoneby the intermixture of British and Egyptian officers and men. In our ArmyRegiments are rarely willing, for obvious reasons, to second really good officers for attachments of this kind; but only the best officers will succeed, and theconditions should be made attractive to them. A Middle Eastern school fortraining local officers and non-commissioned officers might also do much to implantthe idea of common service for a common aim.15. It is a fact that most of the peoples concerned have for the greater partof their history been subject to some foreign despotism, though the ancestorsof some of them have for periods wielded a despotism of their own. Our taskis to find and spread a new technique of union for common needs and aims,stronger than that of over-riding power because it does not challenge but usesand enlists the growing pride of nationalism. It will not be easy&quot; but I am confident that with imagination and common sense combined it can be done.Cairo, 2Sth May, 1945.E. G.
