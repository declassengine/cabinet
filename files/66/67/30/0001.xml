PHIS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJES&apos;TY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 80. MJWy, 1945.CABINET.RELEASES OF STUDENTS FROM THE FORCES.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1. In February the Reconstruction Committee considered the question of releasing a number of University students and Theological students in Class B,but reached no decision. If we are to release students in time to start their courses in October, 1945, an immediate decision must be taken. I have reviewed theposition very carefully and I am satisfied that there is a strong case for releasinga number of Art students and Theological students. I recognise, however, thatit is not practicable to release all young men and women whose education andtraining for professional and other higher appointments has been interrupted by the war.2. Before the war the annual intake of Art students by the universities wasabout 6,000 men and 2,500 women. In the first three years of the war the numbersfell considerably and since 1942 there has been no deferment for men of military age proposing to take Arts Courses. Consequently only women, and a small number of men in Grades III and IV, have been admitted.3. In the case of Science and Engineering students deferment has beengranted throughout the war and about 3,000 young men have been admitted eachyear to take shortened courses. This step was justified by the needs of the Servicesand of industry for men qualified in science and engineering. At this stage ofthe war it is not easy to justify this preponderance of Science and Engineeringstudents, but under present arrangements which have already been authorised,the universities will this year take 2,400 Science students and 600 Arts studentsof military age. It was felt that while there could be no increase in the totalnumber of 3,000 young men deferred from military service we should allow atleast a proportion of Arts students.4. The position, therefore, is that during the war although the courses wereshortened the normal pre-war output of Science and Engineering graduates hasbeen maintained and even increased. On the other hand the number of Artsstudents who have been able, during the war, to qualify for a Degree has steadilydeclined, and in the six years has resulted in a loss of probably about 30,000 men.This shortage of university trained men is serious for the professions, and forteaching in particular, for many of the higher posts in industry and for thePublic Service. That is not, however&apos;, the only ground for making special arrangements for the release of Arts students. We cannot judge this mattersolely by reference to the shortage of trained men which will affect for many years to come all the professional classes. It is certainly in the national interest thatwe should do something to restore the balance between training in Science and engineering on the one hand and the general education given through Artscourses on the other hand.5. From the practical point of view it is very desirable to have an orderlyscheme of release from the Forces of young men who wish to take universitycourses. The release of students throughout the year does not fit in withuniversity arrangements which normally require students to enter in Octoberat the beginning of the academic year. A bulk release of students would there-fore be made in September. Also, if we wait for young men to be released underthe normal operation of the Class A scheme, none will be available to start theircourses in October this year, and comparatively few in October 1946. Thereafter[30228]
they would be released regularly and many of them would have to fill in their time as best they could while waiting to start their course. Also, unless a numberwere released in time to start in both October 1945 and 1946, the universitieswould not be able to cope with the numbers who would seek admission in theautumn of 1947. It is, therefore, in the interests of the universities themselves and of the students that as many as possible should be released in time to starttheir courses in October 1945.56*6. I propose, therefore, that before October 1945 a number of students who wish to take Arts courses should be released in Class B subject to the following-conditions :  (1) A minimum of approximately three years&apos; military service. This shouldbe effected by confining release to men in groups below 50.(2) The men to be released should be of scholarship standard (i.e., obtained by competitive examinations, scholarships, exhibitions or other com-parable awards).(3) There should be nomination for release by the University concerned.7. It is difficult to estimate the numbers who would be eligible for releaseunder these conditions, but the total is unlikely to exceed 3,000. In arrangingthese releases steps would be taken to ensure that the proportion of all releases in Class B to Class A releases did not exceed 10 per cent.8. Strong representations have also been made with regard to the positionof Theological students. In this case, the ground for taking special action restsupon the urgent need of the churches, and it might be thought that there is little to distinguish the church from the professions. I suggest, however, that on general grounds of public interest we should recognise the special claims of the churches and agree to release in Class B not more than 1,500 men over the periodof eight months, i.e., the period during which the first 100,000 Class B releaseswill take place.   They would be selected in the following order :  (1) Men recognised as candidates before September 1939, who had startedtheir training courses, and who, if they wished, could have been reserved;(2) Men recognised as candidates after September 1939 and who had startedtheir training courses before being called up.(3) Other men recognised as candidates by the responsible church authorities.R. A. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,14M July, 1945.
