(45) 57.2nd July, 1945.CABINET.BATTLESHIPS VERSUS AIRCRAFT.Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I attach a memorandum and annex prepared by the Naval Staff, with theconclusions of which I agree.B. B.Admiralty, S.W. 1, 2nd July, 1945.W.P. (44) 764 forms yet another chapter in the history of the battleshipcontroversy. The Admiralty fully agree that the design of all warships mustbe continually examined in order that they may keep pace with contemporaryweapon developments. We make no exception for battleship design; in fact, itis all the more necessary that the design of a warship at once so vital to thesecurity and so costly to the purse of the nation should be kept constantly underreview in the light of developments in both naval and air warfare.2. In the above-quoted paper the view is propounded that building battle-ships is no longer justifiable on the grounds, to which almost the whole of thepaper is devoted, that the battleship is not unsinkable and is therefore useless.3. There is no doubt that the battleship is not unsinkable -this has beentrue for the last 40 years, since the advent of the torpedo and mine. Nor, forthat matter, is any other naval vessel. The battleship is certainly better ableto stand up to damage than is any other type of vessel, and very much better able to do so than is an aircraft-carrier, who, apart from her own vulnerability,may have her aircraft immobilised by a hit on the flight deck and thus be deprived of her power to strike. But this is not the &quot;main advantage&quot; orraison d&apos;etre of the battleship and therein lies the fallacy on which the argu-ments advanced in the paper are principally based (c./., paragraphs 3 and 17 ofthe paper).4. Our object is to seek out and destroy the enemy&apos;s forces which would otherwise be capable of severing the sea communications on which the life ofthe Empire depends.To quote from the War Cabinet paper &quot; For a long time to come it seems certain that trade will have to be very largely carried by sea, and as long as thisis true it is likely that naval vessels will have an important part to play.&quot;5. This being so (and here the Admiralty are in agreement with the WarCabinet paper), in order to ensure the achievement of this object balanced forces must be available, capable of overwhelming any enemy concentration, whatevertypes of ship that concentration may contain. It is therefore necessary, in theAdmiralty view, for our Fleet to contain battleships in order to ensure thedestruction of enemy heavy ships.[30155]
26. The reason for the inclusion of the battleship in a balanced force isthat, being capable of carrying heavy guns and a large quantity of ammunition for them, she can strike the heaviest blows, and keep on striking these blows under any conditions of geographical position, weather or light. This potentiality isa more important factor than the power to survive blows, as is rightly stressedin paragraph 17 of the paper under discussion.Moreover, the battleship being equipped with a powerful A.A. armament can contribute more than any other type of ship to the A.A. gun defence of herselfand the ships with which she is in company.Modern war experience has shown that the battleship is just as muchrequired to give the aircraft-carrier heavy cover as the aircraft-carrier may berequired to give fighter protection to the heavy ship. In short, the two typesare complementary.7. The battleship, in fact, provides a sure means of destroying the enemyheavy ship : bombers can be countered by fighters, but there is no counter to theheavy ship, adequately protected by fighters, except that from suitable surfaceforces. Thus so long as any potential enemy possesses heavy ships, the battleshipwill remain an essential part of our fleet.8. A good example is provided by the action in which the Scharnhorst was sunk : under the conditions of that action nothing but the presence of the duke of York, with her ability to strike hard and go on striking, could have prevented the escape of the enemy. (It is of interest here to remark that theheavy bombing of the scharnhorst lying in harbour at Brest, over a period ofmonths at a range of onlv 150 miles and at the cost of heavy casualties to our airforces, had failed to prevent her eventually putting to sea and becoming a constant menace to our North Russian convoys.)9. Other actions of this war. such as Matapan and the Bismarck operation,show the value of the heavy gun. More recently the Second Battle of the philippines is an instance of the value of the heavy ship. In that case theSouthern Japanese Force was routed by the United States surface forces which included battleships; while on the reverse side of the picture United Statescarriers operating in the Central area who were without heavy support escapedannihilation only because the Japanese battle fleet, which was engaging them,broke off the action.We would not have been able or prepared to run the Russian convoys nor would the United States aircraft-carriers have been able to carry out their recentattacks against the mainland of Japan had not heavy support cover been presentin each case.10. Battleship design which is constantly under review by the admiralty in the light of considerations such as are raised in the paper is, of course, boundto change: it is likely that the &quot;battleship&quot; of the future will bear littleresemblance to the battleship as we know it now : for example, if the rocketweapon replaces the gun it may be possible to build a smaller ship which will still fulfil the essential requirement of the &quot; battleship &quot; i.e., the ability underall conditions to seek out and destroy the most powerful ships of the enemy.11. But we cannot afford, in the interval of waiting for such development,to fail to provide the best which can at present be devised for this purpose. this danger was realised by the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defencewho reported on &quot; the vulnerability of capital ships to air attack &quot; in 1936 areport much of which, is still so relevant that it merits re-reading when consideringthe subject at issue.   They wrote : &quot; The advocates of the extreme air view would wish this country tobuild no capital ships (other Powers still continuing to build them). If theirtheories turn out well-founded, we have wasted money, if ill-founded, wewould, in putting them to the test, have lost the Empire.&quot;(C.I.D. 1258-B, paragraph 57).
References are to W.P. (44) 764 of 29th December, 1944.&apos;: Unsinkable &quot; battleship sunk by aircraft.   (Note at foot of page 1.)The stability of Tirpitz at the time of her sinking was much impairedthrough previous damage both from underwater attack by midget submarines and from air attack. The shore protection consisted in fact of only very slightA.A. and the ship was without fighter protection and immobile. She had existedas a potential menace to our operations for well over twro years prior to herdestruction:The figures of battleships sunk during the present war by aircraft orworships are very debatable and Admiralty assessment wrould say that of 17battleships sunk (excluding 2 French battleships sunk by gunfire) 8-^ were sunk by aircraft and 8^ by warships.Advance in methods of A.A. Fire.   (Paragraphs 7, 10 and 13.)It wrould appear that insufficient account has been taken of the potentialities of G.A.P. In the opinion of the Admiralty it is capable of great development and will supersede the present long-range A.A. gun.High Altitude Bombing.   (Paragraph 7.)Verv high altitude bombing is no doubt possible, but the aircraft will haveto be pressurised and will correspondingly be more vulnerable. It will be essential to watch the development of this closely.&quot; It will be very difficult to produce any proximity faze effective by day or nightwhich cannot be jammed or made to fire prematurely.&quot;   (Paragraph 10.)The Admiralty view is diametrically opposed to that advanced inasmuch asthey believe it extremely difficult to jam V.T. or proximity fuzes. Moreover,should the sensitivity of the fuzes be mixed an attempt to jam some of them will result in the explosion of others in the immediate vicinity of the target.Time of A .A. Fire control calculation.   (Paragraph 12.)The settling time of new- A.A. control gear will be 3-4 seconds, not thepresent figure of 25-30 seconds here given.&quot; So long as the bomber has a good chance of sinking the battleship . . .&quot;(Paragraph 14.)The bomber has not a good chance of sinking the battleship. It is onlybombers in considerable numbers who have a chance against a battleshipprotected by fighters. Thus the argument here developed that the shooting down of &quot; some of the attacking planes &quot; wall not be effective in protecting the targetis hardly sound. It is a matter of degree. If adequate protection can beprovided, and often even if it cannot, the battleship will survive.&quot; The cost of a battleship is of the order of 100 times the cost of a heavy bomber.&quot;(Paragraph 15.)The figures on which calculations of this nature are based are necessarilyhighly debatable. As an instance of the other point of view, the Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defence accepted an agreed Air Ministry-Admiralty figure in 1936 that 43 mediinn bombers represented the cost of onecapital ship.As regards the footnote to this paragraph, if it is necessary to set off the personnel and ancillary services maintaining and protecting the battleshipagainst the ground staff for the heavy bomber one would logically need also toconsider the cost of fighter protection for the bomber and so on.To quote the 1936 report: &quot;The fact is that the relative costs of battle-ships and aeroplanes have not, in themselves, any bearing on the matter. Ifcapital ships are essential to our security we must have them or go under.&quot;&quot; The ocean areas beyond the range of the shore-based bomber will rapidlyshrink.&quot;   (Paragraph 16.)The suggestion that in a few.years&apos; time the areas of ocean outside the range of shore-basecl aircraft will be negligibly small is probably a correct one.
But the problem, as it affects the safety of the Empire, is whether in such a stateof affairs the long-range aircraft would guarantee our merchant shippingimmunity from attack by enemy surface ships. Such a guarantee could only begiven if the answers to the following questions were satisfactory : (1) Will we (or our Allies) be in possession of sufficient territory to ensurethat no stretches of ocean are beyond the range of our shore-based aircraft, accompanied by escorting fighters?(2) If so, could we provide and maintain the men, aircraft, aerodromes, &amp;c.which would be required?The commitment would appear to be enormous.Yet the necessary mobility and flexibility could not be achieved unless thefull world-wide requirement of aircraft, air bases and ground staffs could be andwere provided.We must therefore have mobile striking forces (i.e., ships) which can be con-centrated in any threatened area and will be immediately operative on the out-break of war.
