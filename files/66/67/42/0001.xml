BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 92.3rd August, 1945.cabinet.THE COTTON INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.THE cotton industry which, as my colleagues are aware, has long been ina bad state, has now reached so critical a condition that immediate steps mustbe taken to try and re-establish it on sound lines. Already there is a grave danger of an acute famine in cotton goods in this country and any further delaywill make it a certainty.2. The most immediate need is to get more labour back into the spinningsection. The reason for the difficulty is the bad and unattractive conditions oflabour. During the first half of this year, despite the efforts of the Ministryof Labour and the release of 140,000 workers from munitions in the area, thelabour in the cotton industry fell by 1,000.Recently out of 8,700 female ex-cotton operatives interviewed by the Ministryof Labour 7,000 refused to return to industry.3. Two things are therefore required, an immediate programme to manup the spinning end of the industry and a longer-term programme for there organisation of the industry as a whole.4. It is essential, however, that any arrangements come to for temporarystimulation of the industry should be made on the clear understanding that theyare a part of the total programme and must be accepted as such.5. It is therefore necessary to ask my colleagues to approve the programme as a whole, leaving to me the timing when the different parts must be broughtinto operation.6. As a basis for this new programme a clear statement must be madeof the Governments general attitude to the industry as without such astatement it will not be possible to create the atmosphere of confidence and hopethat is essential.7. I attach as an Annex the form of statement I should propose to make to both sides of the industry on the Government&apos;s general policy.8. Discussions have already been initiated in Lancashire by my predecessorsupon some of the other points and of these two seem likely to be agreed upon by both sides of the industry within the next few days.   These are : (1) A clear statement, satisfactory to the workers, to be made by the employersindicating their willingness to improve wages and conditions andpointing out the good prospects for entrants into the industry.(2) The setting up of a joint commission of 4 members from each side withan impartial Chairman appointed by myself to work out a simplifiedand modernised wage structure for the industry.9.   It is probable that if these two points are agreed, then(3) an understanding will be arrived at to encourage the experiments thatare being tried out at Wye Mill and elsewhere.Some of these are already giving very promising results and will help the corn-mission in arriving at a new wage structure.[30301]
10. The above 3 points are all in the nature of short-term promises tomake the spinning section of the industry more immediately attractive. Theymust, however, be associated with certain further points as part of the wholeprogramme. The further points, based largely upon the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s suggestions earlier put before the Cabinet, when he was Presidentof the Board of Trade, are as follows : (4) The introduction of methods of joint consultation into the industry andof personnel management.(5) Reform of distribution arrangements so as to secure long runs ofproduction.(6) Extension of double-shift working where modern machinery demands it.(7) Re-equipment of mills with more modern machinery.(8) Amalgamations in the spinning section-.11. The above 8 points form the programme which I ask my colleagues to approve.12. It is my intention to visit Manchester on Saturday and Sunday next,the 11th and 12th August. On Saturday morning I.propose to try to settle thematter so far as the spinning section is concerned, on Saturday afternoon to address a delegate conference of the whole industry, including both sides andthe merchants, and on Sunday to put the case to the cotton operatives in 2 or 3of the principal Lancashire towns.R. S. C.Board of Trade, S.W.1.3rd August, 1945.ANNEX.Proposed Statement of Government Policy.The Government are determined that the cotton industry shall once morebecome a flourishing industry and that it shall provide the goods required for home consumption and export on the one hand and good wages and conditions for the operatives on the other.2. To this end the Government are prepared to assist the industry to the best of their ability provided that it is clear that the national interest of producingas great a volume of goods as possible at a reasonable price and with good working conditions for the operatives takes precedence of all other considerations.3. It is not part of the Labour Governments programme to nationalise thecotton industry during this Parliament and they fully appreciate that if theindustry is to continue in the hands of private enterprise it must yield a reasonableprofit to the owners.4. There are, however, conditions in the industry which are militatingagainst its revival and if the industry is to receive the support and help of theGovernment steps must be taken to improve the conditions of working and of organisation.5. To this end the Government have been in consultation with the operativesand the owners in the spinning section of the industry who have agreed to (hefollowing points.[Here follow points 1 and; 2, possibly somewhat elaborated.]The Government has put forward the following additional points which havebeen submitted to-the industry as a whole and which they are prepared to accept as a condition of the support promised by the Government.[Remaining points.]
