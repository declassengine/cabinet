THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 65.10th July, 1945.CABINET.UNIVERSITY COURSES.Memorandum by the Paymaster-General.IT is now nearly six years since the normal outflow of fully-trained people from the universities has been interrupted. Before the war something like10,000 students obtained university degrees every year. Since the war thenumber of men taking a full course in the humanities history, classics, literature,languages, &amp;c. has dwindled to a very small proportion; the scientists have notbeen reduced so much, but many of them have been forced to concentrate on thepractical rather than on the fundamental aspects of science; even the numberof women has fallen considerably in the last two or three years. Though the shortfall varies from subject to subject there is no doubt that we have accumulateda formidable overall deficit of university-trained men. When we remember that even before the war our proportion of people with university degrees was lower than that of any of our principal competitors, this shortage must give rise to serious anxiety.Though, of course, exceptional people can rise to the top without universitytraining, most of the important administrative posts in the Civil Service and thebulk of the legal, medical and teaching professions and many of the higher posts in the business community have been filled by men with university training. Therecent increase in grants to the universities seems to show that the Governmentis not unaware of their value. In the nature of things the effect of a shortfall in trained men does not become immediately evident; it will be ten years hence,when they would have been in their prime, that their absence will be felt. it therefore seems vital to do something as soon as possible to bridge the six-years&apos;gap created by the war and to resume the output of fully qualified university menat an early date.One proposal is that men who have won open scholarships in competition with their fellows should be released under Class &quot; B &quot; or possibly seconded tocomplete their courses. Only a very few thousand would be concerned and theywould be men whose capacity to profit from a university education had alreadybeen definitely established. Another possibility would be to allow all men orwomen who gain open scholarships in whatever subject to come up to the universities and complete their course, doing their military service after they hadtaken their degrees. This was the system in most continental countries in whichconscription prevailed.The present situation is certainly unsatisfactory. Only 3,000 students areto be granted deferment in the coming academic year, and of these not more thanfi00 are to be allowed to take the Arts schools. And whatever may be theintention, even those in this meagre quota have no assurance that they will beable to finish the course. It therefore does seem that urgent steps should be takento cope with the problem. In the modern world the need for highly trained menis constantly increasing. It is no use greatly extending our educational facilities in the schools whilst inhibiting higher education in the universities. And this is what is happening now.Great Georqe Street, S.W. 1,Wth July, 1945.[30181]
