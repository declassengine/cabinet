v OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1945.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. (45) 100.3th August. 1945.CABINET.MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS OF PROCEDURE.Note by the Prime Minister.I annex, for the the information and guidance of my colleagues, a series of notes which they may find it useful to have available on certain points ofprocedure.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W, 1,8th A ugust, 1945.I.f Absence of Ministers from the United Kingdom.1. It is the established practice for a Cabinet Minister to obtain The King&apos;spermission to be absent from the United Kingdom, whether on duty or on leave,and to inform His Majesty of the arrangements which he proposes to make forthe administration of his office during that time.2. A113&apos; such arrangements must have the Prime Minister&apos;s approval and are subject to the following general limitations : -In the absence of a Secretary of State, submissions to His Majesty must bemade on his behalf by another Secretary of State. Submissions on behalf of theFirst Lord of the Admiralty may be made in his absence by the Senior lord commissioner. In the absence of other Cabinet Ministers, submissions may bemade by the Parliamentary Secretary of the Department concerned, if he is aPrivy Councillor; if not, by another Cabinet Minister.II. Proceedings in Cabinet Committees.3. It is contrary to accepted practice for Government decisions to be announced in terms which disclose or imply that they have been reached by aparticular Committee of the Cabinet.[30299]Copy No.
4. The underlying principle is, of course, that the method adopted by ministers for discussion among themselves of questions of policy is essentially a domestic matter, and is no concern of Parliament or the public. The doctrine of collective responsibility of Ministers depends, in practice, upon the existence of opportunities for free and. frank discussion between them, and such discussion is hampered if the processes by which it is carried on arc laid bare.5. For this reason, the general peace-time practice was to avoid disclosure of particulars of the composition and terms of reference of Cabinet Committees,other than of one or two long-established Standing Committees. Since the out-break of war. however, as happened in the last war, some relaxation has beenfound desirable as regards the lay-out of the War Cabinet Committee system, inorder that Parliament may be informed of the main structure of the organisationby means of which the Government handle the great volume of business connectedwith the prosecution of the war. But care has been taken to maintain the general position that detailed particulars of Cabinet Committees generally are notdisclosed, and requests for such information have often been refused. My-colleagues will realise that the question at issue is far from being one of formonly.6. So far as concerns the proceedings of Cabinet Committees, there shouldbe no relaxation of the long-accepted rule against disclosure. A particulardecision should not be disclosed as a decision reached by some particular Com-m it tee or group of Ministers. While the collective responsibility of Ministersoften calls for discussion between Ministers on some important question whichfalls wholly or mainly within the purview of a single Department, the normal course should be for the resulting decision to be announced and defended by theMinister concerned, as his own decision.7. There are. of course, rare occasions when it is desirable to emphasise theimportance of some decision by stating specifically that it is the decision of HisMajesty&apos;s Government or the Cabinet. This, however, should be the exceptionrather than the rule. The growth of any general practice whereby decisions ofthe Cabinet or of Cabinet Committees were announced as such would lead toembarrassments. Thus, some decisions of Government would be regarded as lessauthoritative than others. Critics of the decision reached by a particularMinisterial Committee would press for its review by some other Committee or bythe Cabinet, while the constitutional right of individual Ministers to speak in thename of the Government as a whole would be impaired.III.-Precautions Against Unauthorised Disclosures of Information.8. The Prime Minister invites his colleagues to impress on all concerned the need for exercising the strictest discretion; in particular to see that thefollowing precautions are strictly observed not only in military but in domesticmatters :  (1) While it is within the discretion of Ministers to decide which of their advisers or subordinates should be shown Cabinet papers, the normal
rule is that such papers should not be seen by any save their immediate advisers concerned in the formulation of policy.(2) Ministers are expected to exercise a real measure of control in the matter,and must satisfy themselves from time to time that their instructions are being carried out.(3) If occasions arise on which it is necessary that any considerable numberof officers should be consulted in particular issues arising out ofCabinet papers, this should be done by means of minutes addressedto the officers concerned, confined to the particular points on whichthey are required to advise, thus avoiding a wide circulation of memoranda setting out the views of particular Ministers on mattersof policy which are under discussion in the Cabinet or in a ministerial committee.(4) All servants of the Crown, whether Ministers, members of the FightingServices or Civil Servants, must be most careful to observe cluediscretion in regard to all matters of State. In particular, those whohold high office must remember that the degree of reticence which thevobserve in these matters will be taken as an example by those who serve under them.(5) Experience has shown that leakages of information have often occurredas a result of the skilful piecing together, by representatives of thePress, of isolated scraps of information, each in itself apparently of little importance, gathered from several sources. The only safe rule is, therefore, never to mention such matters even in the form ofguarded allusions, except to those who must be informed of them for reasons of State, until the time has come when disclosure, in whole orin part, is authorised. I am prepared to recognise that reasons ofState may require, in appropriate cases, the confidential communica-tion of some information to a responsible Editor, Lobby Correspondent.&amp;c.. for purposes of guidance; but such communications are onlyjustified where it can be ensured that the confidence and the terms onwhich it is given are respected.(6) It is of the utmost importance in this connection that Press or public relations Branches or Departments should not be informed of cabinet discussions or decisions until action has to he taken by such Branchesor Departments. The information then conveyed, and the instructions given as to its use, should be as precise as possible.IV. Ministerial Speeches and Broadcasts.9. Ministers wishing to mention in public speeches any matter affectingour relations with Foreign Powers or Foreign Affairs, including post-warproblems, should on all occasions consult the Foreign Office beforehand.10. The Prime Minister also asks that all reference in speeches to warstrategy or appreciations of the military efforts overseas of ourselves and our allies, or forecasts of what is likely to happen, should be avoided.   (If for any
reasons such reference cannot be avoided, the passage in question should be shownbeforehand to General Ismay, representing the Minister of Defence, who will beglad to advise.)11. Paragraphs 9 and 10 above apply to broadcasts as well as to otherspeeches.In addition, all Ministers intending to broadcast should communicate with.the Minister of Information, who will be responsible for obtaining the PrimeMinisters approval in the case of Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet,and for making the necessary arrangements with the B.B.C. All Ministers whoare not members of the Cabinet should send a copy of their script to the Ministerof Information, not less than 48 hours- in advance.12. the Prime Minister would be grateful if the contents of this Minutecould be communicated by Ministers to their Ministerial subordinates.V. Parliamentary Private Secretaries.13. Parliamentary Private Secretaries occupy a special position which isnot always understood by the general public, either at home or abroad.14. Parliamentary Private Secretaries are not members of the Government,and should be careful not to be spoken of as such. They are Private Members,and should therefore be afforded as great a liberty of action as possible; but theirclose and confidential association with Ministers necessarily imposes certain obligations on them, and has led to the following generally accepted practice :  That Parliamentary Private Secretaries should not make statements inthe House or put Questions on matters affecting the Department with whichthey are connected. They should also exercise great discretion in anyspeeches or broadcasts which they make outside the House, bearing in mind that, however careful they may be to make it clear that they are speakingonly as Private Members, they are nevertheless liable to be regarded asspeaking with some of the authority which attaches to a member of theGovernment.
