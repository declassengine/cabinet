This is a matter of considerable importance, and lawlessnessshould not be allowed. The law officers and the police should consider all meansof putting an end to these pranks; and the newspapers should be induced as faras possible by the Minister of Information to curtail their publicity.I thought we decided at the last Cabinet at which I was present that allpossible steps were to be taken.Pray let me have a report.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.
