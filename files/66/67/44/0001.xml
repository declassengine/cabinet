Printed for the Cabinet.iqust 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 94.AJh August, 1945.CABINET.KING&apos;S SPEECH ON THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.Note by the Lord President of the Council.1. I circulate herewith for consideration by the Cabinet a draft ofThe King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament which, at the request of thePrime Minister, has been prepared by a Committee of Ministers under my chairmanship.2. It will be observed that the draft Speech promises the following legisla-tion during the Session of Parliament which has just begun : Coalmining Industry Bill:Bank of England Bill.National Investment Board Bill.Supplies and Services&quot; (Transitional Powers) Bill.Town and Country Planning Bill.National Parks Bill.National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill.National Insurance Bill.National Health Service Bill.Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act Repeal Bill.Air Transport Bill.(i(ii(iii(iv(v(vi(vii(viii(ix(x(xiIn addition there will have to be some housing legislation, and there is a long listof other essential or urgent Bills which are not of sufficient importance to meritseparate mention in the Speech but which will make large demands on the timeof Parliament.3. The Bills referred to in paragraph 2 amount to a very heavy legislative programme for the Session and I have invited the Chief Whip to examine itin relation to the Parliamentary time likely to be available.4. In view of the size of the programme it is important that we should use the available Parliamentary time to the best advantage and for this purpose suggest :  (i) that we should not be afraid of the use, within proper limitations,of delegated legislation; and(ii) that wre should take the earliest possible steps to rationalise andmodernise Parliamentary procedure, always providing that theessential supremacy of Parliament is preserved. In this connection it would be well for the Cabinet to give consideration to the proposalsfor alterations in Parliamentary procedure in order to facilitate theprogress of legislation during the reconstruction period, which were drawn up by a Sub-Committee of the Machinery of government committee and were circulated to the War Cabinet on the 1st August,1944, under cover of a memorandum (W.P. (44) 424) by the Chairmanof the Machinery of Government Committee.[30304]
5. I would also urge that Ministers should refrain from putting forwardduring this Session any legislation which is not urgently needed in the publicinterest and that those Ministers who have to bring forward important measures should make every effort to work to a timetable which will ensure that their Billsare brought forward early in the Session. It would be convenient if, a,s in previous years, the Legislation Committee were to keep the Legislative Programmeunder review.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,4th August, 1945.
My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :1. The foremost aims of My Government are to crush for all time the forcesof aggression which still continue the war in the Far East, to create abroadconditions which will enable all countries to turn to the tasks of progress and peace, and at home to carry out to the full those policies which have received theapproval of My people.2. At Berlin My Ministers, in conference with the President of the UnitedStates and Premier Stalin, have laid the foundations on which the peoples ofEurope, after the long nightmare of war, may restore their shattered lands. Iwelcome the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers which will shortlyhold its first meeting in London and will continue the work begun at the conferencein preparation for a final peace settlement.3. My Ministers will submit to you the Charter of the United Nations whichhas now been signed without reservations by the representatives of all the fiftyStates who took part in the Conference at San Francisco and which expresses the determination of the United Nations to maintain peace in accordance with justice and respect for human rights and to promote the welfare of all peoples by inter-national co-operation.4. It has given Me special pleasure to meet the President of the UnitedStates on his brief visit to My country after the Conference at Berlin. I havealso been glad to express the gratitude of this country to the Supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force for his inspiring leadership in the campaign for the liberation of Europe.5. My Fleets are co-operating with the Forces of the United States inattacks on the Japanese islands and My Air Forces will shortly join in the increasingly heavy blows levelled at the heart of Japanese armed resistance.Meanwhile, My Armies and Air Forces in co-operation have driven from Burmaall but the remnants of the Japanese forces, and My Australian Forces have successfully begun the liberation of Borneo. In China too the tide of battle hasturned and the expulsion of the Japanese from Chinese soil has begun. I grievefor the peoples of My Empire and for all other peoples who still suffer underJapanese tyranny and I pray that the end of their ordeal may not be long-delay ed.6. In Europe My Forces continue to discharge the heavy tasks entailed inthe occupation of enemy countries and the relief and repatriation of the many thousands of persons who were deported from their homes by the enemy. MyNavy, aided by the Navies of My Allies, is clearing the seas of mines so thatmerchant ships and fishing fleets may once more sail in safety.7. The war against Japan will continue to demand the most strenuous efforts from both managements and workers to provide ample supplies of themost modern equipment for My Forces. It will be the special care of my ministers to see that these demands are met and to plan for the continuation inthe years after the war of the co-operation between science, industry and the armed Forces which has proved so successful.Members of the House: of Commons :8. You will be asked to make further financial provision for the continuanceof the war, and for expenditure on reconstruction and other essential services.(    My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :9. My Government will continue the orderly release of men and women from the Armed Forces on the basis of the plans announced in the autumn of
last year and will take every step to secure that these plans are carried out withthe greatest speed consistent with our military commitments and fair treatment to serving men and women. The arrangements already in operation for the resettlement in civil life of men and women released from the Forces and from war work, including those who have been disabled during their service, will becontinued and, where necessary, expanded.10. It will be the aim of My Ministers to see that the national resources in labour and material are employed to the full in the interests of My people and that the standard of living is progressively improved. In the pursuit ofthis aim the special problems of Scotland and. Wales will have the attention ofMy Ministers.11. My Government will take up with energy the tasks of reconvertingindustry from the purposes of war to those of peace, of expanding our exporttrade, and of securing by an extension of public ownership or control and by other means conducive to increased efficiency that the industries and services of thecountry shall make their maximum contribution to the national well-being. Forthese purposes appropriate measures will be laid before you. These measures will include legislation to bring the coalmining industry and the Bank ofEngland under public ownership and to set up a National Investment Board to aid in planning the use of our financial resources in the national interest.12. You will be asked to approve legislation to ensure the retention duringthe period of transition from war to peace of those emergency powers which arenecessary to secure the right use of our commercial and industrial resources andthe equitable distribution at fair prices of those supplies and services which are essential for the well-being of My people.13. It will be the most urgent task of My Ministers to drive on with theprovision of the greatest possible number of houses both by new building andby all other available means; and for this, as well as for the other heavy tasksconfronting it, they will organise all the resources of the building industry.They will also seek to secure the better use of land in the national interest andwill provide for the establishment of national parks.14. Legislation will be introduced to provide a comprehensive scheme of insurance against industrial injuries, to extend and improve the existing schemeof social insurance and to establish a national health service.15. You will be asked to approve the repeal of the Trade Disputes andTrade Unions Act..16. My Ministers will develop to the&quot; fullest possible extent the home production of good food. To this end they will continue, with suitableadaptations, those war-time policies under which food production has been organised and the efficiency of agriculture improved, and will take all necessary steps to promote a healthy fishing industry. The ravages of war have madeworld food supplies insufficient to meet, demands, but My Ministers will do allin their power to provide and distribute food to My people at prices which theycan afford to pay; and they will keep in being and extend the new food services for the workers and for mothers and children which have been established duringthe war.17. A measure will be laid before you to give effect to the plans already announced for the reorganisation of air transport.18. It will be^the aim of My Government to bring into practical effect atthe earliest possible date the educational reforms which you have already approved.19. In accordance with the promises already made to My Indian peoples,My Ministers will strive to secure the earliest possible achievement of self-government in India, and they will press on with the work of promoting thedevelopment of My Colonial Empire and the welfare of its peoples!20.   I pray that Almighty God may give His blessing to your counsels.
