(45) 99.8th August, 1945.CABINET.CABINET PROCEDURE.Note by the Prime Minister.I annex, for the information and guidance of my colleagues, a memorandumon Cabinet procedure.   I draw particular attention to paragraph 20.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,8th August, 1945.Submission of 1.   Memoranda for consideration by the Cabinet should beBusiness to the circulated well in advance of the meeting at which they are to cabinet. be considered.   The pre-war rule, by which no memorandum was placed on the Agenda until at least five days after it had been circulated, was waived at the outbreak of war; but, save in casesof special urgency, it is now the normal practice to allow two cleardays at least to elapse between the circulation of a memorandum andits consideration.2. The Prime Minister asks Ministers so far as possible to adhere to the rule that questions are not submitted for considera-tion by the Cabinet until the point to be settled has beennarrowed to a defined issue. This will normally call for adequateprior discussion with other Departments concerned, includingdiscussion with the Treasury of proposals which would involveexpenditure or affect general financial or economic policy. this rule does not, of course, limit the right of Ministers to submit tothe Cabinet memoranda setting out their views on general issues of policy.[30298]

When a Minister wishes to raise a matter orally at theCabinet, his Private Secretary should give the earliest possiblenotice to the Secretary, who will seek the Prime Ministers consent.4. The procedure outlined above applies mutatis mutandis to ministerial Committees of the Cabinet.5. If a member of the Cabinet is unable, for any reason, to be present at a meeting of the Cabinet, he should notify the Secretary,who will inform the Prime Minister and will also consider whether any arrangement of business is required.6. The Secretary should also be informed of Ministers&apos;week-end arrangements, in order that, if some sudden emergencyarises, he may be in a position to inform the Prime Minister at oncewhich Ministers are immediately available.7. It is of assistance to the Secretary if Private Secretariesindicate, when asking for a subject to be placed on the Agenda,which Ministers, other than members of the Cabinet, are likely tobe affected, so that arrangements may, if necessary, be made fortheir attendance.8. Ministers summoned to meetings of the Cabinet for particular items will receive an Agenda Paper on which an approximate time will be set against each item. Every endeavouris made not to keep Ministers waiting, but the time at which eachitem will be reached cannot be forecast exactly.9. It is an instruction to the Secretary, in drafting cabinet conclusions, to avoid, so far as practicable, reference to opinions expressed by particular Ministers.&apos; The record in respect of eachitem will be limited to the decision of the Cabinet, together withsuch summary of the discussion as may be necessary as guidance tothose called upon to take action on the decision.10. The Conclusions of the Cabinet are circulated by theSecretary to (a) Cabinet Ministers; and (b) Ministers holdingOffices &apos;; of Cabinet rank.&quot;11. On matters of exceptional secrecy, the Conclusions are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File, copies being sent in theform of a &quot; Confidential Annex &quot; only to those Ministers directly concerned.Action on conclusions.12. All Ministers are themselves responsible for giving suchinstructions to their Departments as may be necessary to give effectto the Conclusions of the Cabinet.
13. Ministers are also responsible for communicating to subordinate Departments or branches decisions of which they shouldbe made aware.14. The Lord Chancellor is responsible for communicating tothe English Law Officers such decisions as concern them.15. Where a Department has to take action upon, or isotherwise directly affected by, a particular Conclusion, the actualdecisions of the Cabinet may be copied in the Department,together with so much of the record of the discussion as is essentialto a proper understanding of them, and these extracts may be passed to responsible officers in the Department, as may be necessary.The distribution within a Department of such extracts fromCabinet Conclusions should be limited to the occasions on which it. - is strictly necessary for the efficient discharge of public business.and care should be taken to see that extracts are sent only to those officers of the Department who need be acquainted with the actualterms of the decision. Duplicate copies of the complete conclusions are not issued for this purpose by the Cabinet Office save in exceptional cases.16. Where action has to be taken, at once by a Departmentwithout waiting for the circulation of the full Conclusions, applica-tion may be made to the Secretary for an advance copy of the relevant Conclusion. Yvrhere an urgent matter arises unexpectedly,and a decision is reached requiring immediate action by a Depart-ment not represented at the Meeting, the Secretary will ensure thatthe Department concerned is notified forthwith.Amendments 17    Any suggested amendments to Cabinet Conclusions mustto Conclusions, reach the Secretary not later than the next clay but one followingthat on which the Meeting was held.   Thereafter the Conclusionswill he sent to be printed in final form.Cabinet 18.   Cabinet Memoranda should be so drafted as to bring outMemoranda. clearly and succinctly the issue or issues for decision. This canmost easily be done by means of a summary statement setting out therecommendations for which the Cabinefs approval is sought.19. Subject to such special instructions in regard to anyparticular paper as he may receive from the Prime Minister or fromthe responsible Minister, the Secretary circulates memoranda andother documents prepared for their- use to all Cabinet ministers and, in addition, either to,all Ministers &quot; of Cabinet rank&quot; or tothose Ministers whose Departments are affected.Conclusions 20.   Cabinet Conclusions and Memoranda may be shown byand Ministers, at their discretion, to their Ministerial subordinates and memoranda.     to their responsible advisers.

Parliamentary Secretaries need not beinformed of more than is necessary for the discharge of their parliamentary and political duties.21. Cabinet memoranda are normally reproduced by theCabinet Office, the draft being sent to the Cabinet Office for thepurpose by the originating Department. If for any reason aCabinet memorandum is reproduced by the originating Department,all copies thus reproduced must be sent to the Cabinet Office,application being made to the Cabinet Office for any additionalcopies required by the reproducing Department. If a Departmentso wishes, a, standing arrangement may be made whereby the cabinet office will automatically supply a fixed number of additional copiesof memoranda originating in the Department.22. In no circumstances, other than those provided for inparagraph 21 above, are Cabinet memoranda to be reproduced orcopied in Departments. Where a Department requires anadditional copy or copies of a memorandum, application must inevery case be made to the Cabinet Office.23. It is the normal practice that Ministers, on relinquishingoffice, should return to the Cabinet Office all Cabinet documents,save any required for current administration, which may be handedon to their successors.Ministers are asked to arrange for the return to the cabinet office during their tenure of office, say at intervals of three or six months, such Cabinet papers as they do not require to retain for current administration.
