THIS DOCUMENT 18 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1945. /The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. II is issuedor the personal use of .......TOP SECRET, Copy ifo.CP. (45) 72.11th July, 1945.CABINET.MAN-POWER IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1945.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their meeting on the 6th July (CM. (45) 11th Conclusions, Minute 4)the Cabinet invited the Man-power Committee to submit at an early date revised proposals for the redistribution of man-power in the second half of 1945. TheCommittee were to give special attention to the Prime Minister&apos;s proposals(CP. (45) 61 and 62) regarding the release of women from the Services; and thePrime Minister subsequently suggested as a target the release of half a millionwomen from the Services and the munitions industries during the next threemonths.2. The Man-power Committee are satisfied that it would be inexpedient toabandon the present policy of controlled release of women from the Services;and they do not recommend that any woman who wishes to leave the services should be allowed to do so.In pursuance of the Government policy that the Services should employwomen to the maximum extent in order to release men for combatant duties,the women in the Forces have been fully integrated into the Service machine and most of them are doing jobs that would otherwise be done by men. If women were now allowed to leave the Services at will, and if substantial numbers tookadvantage of this freedom to leave, several important branches in each service would be faced with deficiencies involving total breakdown; and throughout the branches where women are employed efficiency would suffer. Trained men arenot available to take the place of these women; and even if men could be trained in time to take their place, such employment of men to take the place of women would have the effect of retarding the release of men in Class A. The Committeeconclude that the uncontrolled release of women from the Services would notonly seriously impair the efficiency of the Armed Forces, but would also retardthe demobilisation of men in Class A and would be likely to arouse discontentwhich might endanger the demobilisation scheme as a whole.3. The Committee have therefore considered how far it would be possibleto increase the releases of women from the Services (beyond the figure of 135,000proposed in their earlier report CP. (45) 53) without abandoning the principlesof the demobilisation scheme and running into the serious difficulties set outin the immediately preceding paragraph.The Committee suggest that the Services should seek to increase the numbers to be released before the end of this year by a drastic review of establishments andby carrying, as far as possible within the general framework of the demobilisa-tion scheme, a policy of discharging women from branches in which there isredundancy instead of retaining them for eventual remustering and retraining.The Committee recommend that the Service Ministers should aim at securino- by[30212]
these means that their total releases of women in the second half of 1945 areraised to about 200,000.   The target figure for each of the Services would be : W.R.N.S.............        22,000A.T.S.............      110.000W.A.A.F.............        68,000Total .........      200,0004. On existing plans cuts in the munitions industries should enable about900,000 workers to be released up to the end of 1945, and it is estimated thatroughly 350,000 of these will be women. If in the same period the Services canrelease approximately 200,000 women, the result will be to make available overthe remainder of 1945 from both the Services and munitions industries a total ofover half a million women.5. This increased release of women from the Services will go only a smallway towards bridging the gap between the demand for man-power in thesecond half of 1945, and the numbers of men and women available to meet this demand. Workers are urgently needed for the housing programme, themaintenance and restoration of our civilian services and industries and theexpansion of the export trade; and if the necessary workers are not madeavailable in the critical months immediately ahead, the results may be disastrous. The Committee therefore consider that the Service ministers should make a further effort to increase the number of men to be released fromthe Forces by the end of 1945, mainly by accelerating the operation of theexisting demobilisation plans. The aim should be to release by the end of 1945an additional 200,000 men in Class A over and above the 684,000 men in Class Awho will be released under existing plans. These releases might be allocatedamong the three Services as follows : Class AReleases on Existing    Additional Class A.Plans. Releases Proposed.Royal navy    ........... 90,000 20,000Army   .... -     ............ 468,000 110,000&apos;R.A.F................. 126,000 70,000Total   ........ 684,000 200,000In their earlier report to the Cabinet the Man-Power Committee (OP. (45) 53)assumed that in addition to the release of 684,000 men in Class A, 69,000 men would be released in Class B, and the intakes xecommmencled covered the replace -ment of these Class B releases. If the Services released an additional 200,000 in class A, this would permit of an increase in Class B releases (up to a totalof 20,000) to the extent that additional intakes could be provided in replacement.6. The Committee have discusssed with the Service Ministers the proposals put forward in paragraphs 3 and 5 above for increasing the releases of men andwomen from the Forces during the second half of 1945. The Service ministers have undertaken to do their utmost to achieve the higher targets proposed inthese paragraphs.7. On present plans releases from the munitions industries up to the endof 1945 will amount to 900,000 men and women. In view, however, of the urgentneeds of civilian industries, the Committee consider that the Service and SupplyMinisters should find means of increasing the releases from the munitions industries during the second half of 1945, even though this may increase therisk of dislocation and temporary local unemployment during the switch-over to civilian production.The effect of the recommendations made in the foregoing paragraphs wouldbe to make available an additional 330,000 (200,000 men and 130,000 women) fromthe Forces in the second half of 1945. Those released in Class A will not allenter employment in the essential services and industries which must be built up; but, if it were possible for the Supply Departments to supplement thesereleases from the Forces by a further release of the order of 100,000 from the munitions industries we should have gone a long way towards bridging the gapof 400.000 between the supply of man-power and the stated needs of civilianindustries and services.
8. If the Service and Supply Departments can achieve the targets suggestedin this Memorandum, we shall have virtually closed the statistical gap and shouldbe able to meet the global demands of the Departments responsible for thereconstruction of our civil industry. But those demands, even if they were met in full, would not carry us far along the road to reconstruction at home. Theywould not produce any appreciable improvement in civilian standards and wouldpromise us little progress towards the restoration of .our export trade.As indicated in Part I of their earlier Report (CP. (45) 53) the Committeegravely doubt whether the man-power resources of the country, after six yearsof war, are sufficient to sustain a military effort in Stage II on the scale at present planned. They recognise that this is a major issue of policy which must be decidedty the Defence Committee and the Cabinet; but the further review of the man-power situation which they have carried out at the Cabinet&apos;s request has rein-forced their view that, if we are to make satisfactory progress with our greattasks of reconstruction at home, we ought to seek means of limiting our military commitments in Stage II, whether for active operations in the Far East or forgarrison duty in Europe and the Middle East. We feel bound to press this pointupon the attention of the Cabinet and to suggest that it should be kept prominentlyin mind in the forthcoming discussions at the Three Power Meeting.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,Uth July, 1945.
