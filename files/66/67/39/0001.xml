DRAFT PROCLAMATION BY THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENTS(l) We,   the president of &quot;the United States, and theprime Minister of Great Britain,  representing the hundreds of millions of our countrymen,, have conferred and agree that japan shall he given an opportunity to end this war(2) The prodigious land,  sea and air forces of theUnited States, the British Empire and of China, many timesreinforced.by their armies and air fleets from the west havenow been joined by the vast military might of the soviet union, and are poised to strike the final bl*ws upon Japan.This military power is sustained and inspired &quot;by the determination of all the Allied nations to prosecute the war against Japan until her capitulation,(3) The result of the futile and senseless german resistance to the might If the aroused free peoples of theworld stands forth in awful clarity as an example tm thepeople of Japan.      The might&apos;that now converges an Japan isimmeasurably greater than that which, when applied to theresisting Nag;is,  necessarily laid waste to the lands, theindustry and the method of life of the whole German people.The full application of our military power, hacked &quot;by ourresolve, will mean the inevitable and complete destructionof the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably theutter devastation of the Japanese homeland.(Li) The time has come for Jan an to decide whethershe will continue to he controlled by those self-willedmilitaristic advisers whose unintelligent calculations have brought the Empire to the threshold of annihilation,  orwhether she will follow the path of reason.(5) Following are our terms.      We will ny,t deviate from them.      There are no alternatives.      We shall brook no delay.(6) There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceives, and misled thepeople of Japan into embarking on world conquest,  for weinsist that a new order of peace,  security and justice willbe impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from he wo rl d.(7) Until such a new p-rder is established and until there is convincing proof that Japan&apos;s war-making power isdestroyed, points in Japanese territory to he designated bythe Allies shall he occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting, forth.(8) The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carriedout and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu,  Hokkaido, Kyushu,  Shikoku and such minor islandsa s we de t e memorandum ne.(9) The Japanese military forces,  after being completelydisarmed,  shall be permitted to return to their homes withthe opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.

(10) We do not intend that the Japanese shall beenslaved as a race or destroyed, as a nation, but sternjustice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners.      TheJapanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revivaland strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanesere ople.(11) Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit theexaction of oust reparations  in kind, but not those whichwould enable her to re-arm for war.      To this end,  access to,as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted.      Eventual Japanese participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.(12) The occupying forces of    he Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives havebeen accomplished and there has been established inaccordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanesepeople a peacefully inclined and responsible government.(13) We call upon the G-over-nment of_Japan to proclaimnow the unconditional surrender of all the Japanese armed forces,  and to provide proper and adequate assurances oftheir good faith in such action.      The alternative for japan is prompt and utter destruction.
