HQCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S (^ffEKNMKNTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1945.Copy &quot;No.   32CABINET.MAN-POWER REVIEW, 1st JUNE TO 31st DECEMBER, 1945.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1. The total working population of Great Britain at the 31st May, 1945,is estimated at 21,710,000 (including 90,000 unemployed). This total includes all prisoners of war in Europe (hitherto excluded from statistics of the working population).It is estimated that by the end of the year the total of 21,710,000 will havefallen by 1,140,000 to 20,570,000 (including possibly 150,000 unemployed). the decrease is accounted for as follows : -Wastage by death, by reaching age 65 (men), age 60 (women) and excess of wastage to non-industrial section over intake therefrom : From Forces ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 81,000From Civil Defence        ............ 17,000From Industry Normal............ 342,000Abnormal        ......... 700,000----      1,042,000i r Q.100SECRET.CP. (45) 96.8th August, 1945.Total...............      1,140,0002. Large numbers of women with household responsibilities will retire from industrial employment during the next seven months. No exact estimate ispossible, but on the assumption that two out of three will remain in industrial employment the estimated loss to industry by the end of the year, out of the2 million women specially mobilised for war-time employment, is put at 700,000(two part-time women being counted as a unit). This figure is shown inparagraph 1 above as abnormal wastage. It is possible that less than two out ofthree will remain in employment when winter approaches and when men return from the Forces.  In that case the abnormal wastage will be higher.3. If there were no intake into the Forces from industry^) in the second half of the year the changes in the strength of (a) the Forces, (b) the Police,National Fire Service and Civil Defence (General) Services, (c) industry and Id) the unemployed, in June and in each of the last two quarters of the year wouldbe approximately as follows : Estimated Strengths.(Thousands).	31st May	30th June	30th Sept,	31st Dec.Forces Police, National Fire Service, Civil Defence (General) Services Industry ... Unemployed Total working population	5,130 158 16,332 90	5,080 140 16,045 100	4,800 107 15,973 120	4,127(*) 100 16,193(3) 150	21,710	21,365	21,000	20,570(J) The figures in the table for the Forces and for the total working population allow for intakeinto the Forces in the second half of the year of 10,000 students from the non-industrial section.(2) It is assumed that releases under the Reallocation Scheme will number 909,000, includ-ing about 73,000 class B releases, of which 40,000 will go to the building industry.(3) This figure assumes that all those released from the Forces up to 31st December whodecide to go into industry will have taken up work by that date. -In fact, a large number will still be on leave and these may amount to as many as 150,000.[30307] b
The Table shows that, after allowing for a release of 909,000 men and women fromthe Forces, the numbers in industry as a whole would fall by 287,000 in June, bya further 72,000 in the third quarter, and that there would be a rise of about220,000 in the last quarter of the year. The net change in industry as a wholeduring the period the 1st June to 31st December would thus show a decreaseof about 139,000.4. Industry Groups(&apos;) II and III have borne the brunt of mobilisation forwar purposes. Group III in particular has suffered a heavy net reduction in thenumbers employed. Neither of these groups can bear further cuts. On thecontrary they are urgently in need of substantial expansion. The man-power required for new intakes into the Forces and for the expansion of civilian industry must be found in the last resort from the Group I munitions industries (metal and chemical industries).5. Within the Group I industries substantial cuts are to be made in thenumbers working for the Supply Departments. Existing plans provide that thesecuts will amount during the last seven months of this year to approximately900,000. On present plans this is the number that will be available (a) to offset the net decrease in industry; (b) to provide new intakes into the Forces and (c)to expand civilian industry. As shown in paragraph 3 above, the net decrease in industry is estimated at 139,000, and this leaves a total of 761,000 available forpixwiding intake into the Forces and the expansion of civilian industry.6. The expansion of the labour force of the building and civil engineering industries is of the highest priority. It is estimated that releases from the Forcesin Classes A and B will provide 110,000 men for building and civil engineering and that a further 65,000 can be transferred from other industries following thespecial registration of ex-builders which has been made. Other ordinary intakewill offset normal wastage. The releases from the Forces and transfers fromother industries will yield an estimated net increase in building and civil engineering by the end of the year of 175,000.7. This would leave 586,000 as the maximum supply available to provideintake into the Forces and an expansion of the rest of civilian industry. Thedemands of Departments for civilian industries and services other than building and civil engineering amount to a total net increase of 675,675. A summary ofthese demands is given in the Appendix.8. The demands of Service Departments for intake into the Forces duringthe second half of the year are to be met from industry to the extent of 150,000men and up to 20,500 women. The total demand thus amounts to 846,175 against which the available supply after meeting the required increase in building and civil engineering is 586,000.   There is tho? a shortage of 260,175.9.   The foregoing may be summarised as follows :  Total supply derived from munitionscuts ...       ............       900,000Deduct net decline in industry     ...       139,000Balance available  for  Forces  and expansion of civilian industry   ... ... 761,000Required   for   building   and   civil engineering............ ... 175,000Balance ...... ... 586,000Intake for the Forces from industry ... 170,500Balance    available    for    civilianindustry other than building and civil engineering (net increase) ... ... 414,500Demands  for industry other thanbuilding and civil engineering    ... ... 675,000Deficiency       ...... ... 260,175(4) Group II comprises the basic industries: agriculture; National and Local Government;Utilities; Transport; Food, drink and tobacco manufacture. Group III comprises the industriesmainly serving civilian needs building and civil engineering; distributive trades; textiles;clothing; leather; wood; paper; bricks, pottery and glass; and other manufactures and services such as commerce and finance; professions; entertainment; hotels; laundries and cleaning.
10. I am bound to point out that the deficiency may be greater than thefigure of 260,175 for the following reasons -.&apos; (i) The estimates are based on the assumption that by the end of 1945industry will lose 700,000 out of the 2,000,000 additional women whohave been specially mobilised for war-time employment. This may prove to be an under-estimate:(ii) No account has been taken in the estimate of the fact that men released from the Services in Class A are free to take at least two months&apos;leave with full pay and allowances. On the basis that not more thanone month&apos;s leave is taken on the average, this would mean that150,000 men would still be on leave and not yet employed in industry at the end of the year,(iii) The estimates of the numbers unemployed may be on the low side. Ifunemployment were to be more than 150,000 at the end of 1945 anyexcess would have to be deducted from the numbers employed in civilian industries and services.11. In considering the allocations to meet the civilian demands it must benoted that men and women released from Class A are free to take any job they wish and a large proportion of the early releases will consist of those who havere-instatement rights in their previous employment. It may well be thatappreciable numbers will take up employment in industries and services which,on any grounds, have a low priority and which, are not covered by the stateddemands of the Departments. The actual numbers becoming available for civilianindustries against the stated demands are, therefore, likely to be far short of thebalance of 415,500 shown in paragraph 9.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,8th August, 1945.[30307]
