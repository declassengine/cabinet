TANNIC MPrinted for the CabinetJuly 1945.Copy No.CP. (45) 67.7th July, 1945.CABINET.DISPOSAL OF THE GERMAN FLEET.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.MARSHAL STALIN, in a message to the Prime Minister and Presidentdated the 23rd May, after reciting that the Germans refused to surrender a singlenaval or merchant vessel to the Soviet Armed Forces, said : &quot; Under these circumstances the question naturally arises ofapportioning to the Soviet Union her share of the German Naval and merchant Vessels, in accordance with the earlier example of Italy. TheSoviet Government considers that it can with full reason and justice count on a minimum of one-third of the Navy and Merchant Marine of Germany.&quot;He was informed that this question should form part of the forthcoming Three-Power discussions.2. It is the fact that all the important German naval units survivingundamaged, including the cruisers Prinz Eugen, Nurnberg and Leipzig (collisiondamage only), 26 destroyers and torpedo-boats, 147 U-boats, and a large numberof auxiliary vessels, have fallen into the hands of the British and United StatesNavies. The Russians hold only damaged ships, including the battleshipsGneisenau, Schleswig Holstein and Schlesien, the pocket battleship Lutzow, theaircraft-carrier Graf Zeppelin, and about 10 damaged or incomplete U-boats. a detailed statement is attached at Annex I.3. The Americans, last November, circulated to the European advisory commission a memorandum on the disposal of the German Navy in which they proposed a policy of wholesale scrapping, with the exception of (a) vessels of special design required for experimental purposes;(b) vessels required for immediate operational purposes, eg., minesweeping;(c) vessels capable of being converted to civilian use.4. The Admiralty consider the scrapping of the combat units of theGerman Fleet to be in the best interests&quot; both of the Royal Navy and of world peace. It would be unprofitable for us to man German units against Japan owingto the difficulties which arise in maintenance and in the provision of ammunition and spares. The same objection applies to their employment in the Far Eastwith Allied crews. Again, the inclusion of German warships in post-war Alliedfleets would tend to give rise to demands for spares from German productionand thus to keep alive the German war potential. It would also increase the temptation to employ German naval technicians. So far as concerns the Navieswho have operated under the Royal Navy during the war, there is the further serious objection that it would conflict with our policy of equipping them fromBritish production in order to facilitate future naval co-operation and to stimulate development of our own naval potential and commerce.[30188]B
5. The Admiralty-, although in full sympathy with the American views, didnot think it advisable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should come out m opensupport of their memorandum. The Russians are very unlikely to agree toscrap the German Fleet, and by disclaiming any wish to employ German warshipswe would have invited an inflated Russian claim.6. Marshal Stalin bids for a minimum of one-third on the grounds ofreason, justice and the Italian precedent. As to the latter, the Russians werenot granted one-third, but a specified number of ships totalling less than one-quarter of the Italian Fleet. Moreover, the Russian request for Italian shipswas put forward and granted partly on the basis of immediate needs for the prosecution of the war against Germany.   .7. The exertions and losses of the Red Navy give no foundation for a claimto one-third. The Russian contribution at sea has been almost negligible.Indeed, Russian suspicion materially obstructed the protection of the northernconvoys. The Red Navy&apos;s losses, estimated in the table at Annex II, do not,except in submarines, compare with those of the Royal Navy and the UnitedStates Navy. The Russian Pacific Fleet, including at least 100 submarines, isintact. The Russians must therefore justify their claim on the general, not thenaval contribution of the U.S.S.R. to the common victory.8.   British requirements for German ships are for (a) 3 destroyers, 1 torpedo boat and a large number of U-boats for experi-mental purposes; the U-boats are for extended explosive trials, whichwould be tantamount to scrapping them.(b) A number of auxiliary vessels, such as naval tankers and depot ships for the Far Eastern war. Some of these ships are already being prepared for the Far East.(c) Other specialised ships which would make valuable additions to ourresearch and experimental resources.The United States have asked for 2 destroyers for technical experiment, and are known to require some LT-boats for the same purpose. They have not, however,yet tabled their detailed demands.9. The disposal of the surrendered German ships is a matter on whichthe French, who will be absent from &quot; Terminal,&quot; will presumably claim a rightto speak. They are parties to the Instrument of Military Surrender and of theAllied Declaration. They have unofficially intimated that they will ask for somedestroyers and U-boats to tide them over the-period before their own yards canagain build new ships. On the other hand, a French claim to German warshipshas few merits, since the parlous state of the French Fleet to-day is largely due.to their own defaults.10. The Admiralty&apos;s aim is to satisfy British requirements and to keepU-boats out of undesirable hands, particularly Russian hands. It is believedthat the Americans, also, will have the latter objective. As the German warshipsare all in our hands, our bargaining position is extremely strong. Accordingly,it is proposed that the following tactics should be adopted at &quot; Terminal &quot; :- &quot;(a) If the Americans are prepared to press for the scrapping of the Germancombat fleet, we should strongly support their proposals as being in thebest interests of world security. We should be careful, however, toavoid stating that we are disinterested in acquiring units of &apos;theGerman Fleet.(6) If the Russian demand for a division has to be met, we should claim our full share. The Russians, for reasons of prestige, are likely to be tempted by the offer of cruisers and destroyers. We do not covet the surface combat ships and should insist on taking our share primarilyout of the U-boat fleet.11. The fact that the Soviet Navy have lost 92 submarines compared withour own loss of 76 and the U.S.A. of 47 is the most troublesome obstacle to our policy of withholding U-boats from the U.S.S.R. On the other hand, the losses of the R.N. and U.S.N. in major surface ships are enormously greater than those
of the Red Navy, and the Russians will be ill-advised to press losses as the yard-stick for disposal if they wish to obtain any surface ships at all. The following is the suggested division of the German Fleet : Russia.NurnbcrgLeipzigGraf Zeppelin \Lutzow j6 Destroyers2 Torpedo boats10 U-boats50 MinesweepersDamagedUnited Kingdom.United States.France.Prinz Eugen! (for technical examination in UnitedKingdom and United States).4 Destroyers2 Torpedo boats65 U-boatsNaval tankers andauxiliaries4 Destroyers2 Torpedo boats65 U-boats94 Destroyers2 Torpedo boats6 U-boatsMinesweepersOlder depot ships andauxiliaries not requiredby Royal Navy or united States Navy.If the above is insufficient to obtain a settlement, there would be no objectionto offering the U.S.S.R. 2 further destroyers and 2 torpedo boats, and PrinzEugen in six months&apos; time after completion of the technical examination inthe&apos; United Kingdom and the U.S.A. We should be very loath to increase thefigure for U-boats. The lowest possible number of U-boats should be given tothe Russians which will secure a settlement. If the Russians contest the alloca-tion of U-boats to the R,N and U.S.N., they should be reminded that (a) the R.N. and U.S.N. have in two major wars borne a very heavy burdenin defeating the U-boats and are entitled to insist upon their viewsprevailing concerning the disposal of U-boats;(b) the Red Army announced the capture of 45 U-boats at Danzig.     we knew this to be untrue, but the Russians may find it embarrassing togo back on the Red Army&apos;s announcement;(c) they have taken over the whole Roumanian Fleet, including 4 destroyers,3 torpedo boats, 3 submarines, gunboats and other craft.137 of the U-boats now lie in United Kingdom ports, a potent argument.12. Marshal Stalin&apos;s demand covers both warships and merchant ships,but the same principles do not necessarily apply to the disposal of both classesof ship. The German warships are spoils of war to be divided among the victors.Merchant ships, on the other hand, are property which naturally falls to be dealtwith under the heading of reparations. The United Kingdom Delegation in moscow has, therefore, instructions concerning the disposal of merchant shipsbut not of warships. The Ministry of War Transport are, it is understood,proposing that Marshal Stalin should be informed&quot;, in respect of the merchant ships, that they should properly form the subject of the discussions at the reparations Conference, and that no final decisions can be taken at &quot; Terminal.&quot;There is everything to be gained, however, from an early decision concerning the warships so as to enable disposal to proceed. Otherwise, there will be a con-tinning commitment in security and maintenance of the ships, and the disband-ment of German naval personnel will be delayed. Accordingly, it is consideredthat we should adopt the principle that disposal of warships lies within thecompetence of the Three Powers at &quot; Terminal,&quot; subject to reference to theFrench on the question of their allocation.13. No difficulty is expected with the Dominion Navies, provided that ourintended policy is explained to them before &quot; Terminal.&quot; If my colleagues agreewith my proposals, I suggest that a telegram should be sent to Dominion Govern-ments summarising the arguments. Canada would retain the tAvo U-boats shenow holds.14.   Although the minor Allied Navies have not in fact made demands for german ships, they may express disappointment that they are to receive noallocation.   I do not think that they will have any reasonable grounds of com-plaint.   We must, however, avoid giving these Allies the impression that their[30188] B 9
interests have been overlooked. This could be avoided if our policy were explained to them in advance of any announcement. The policy we are following is virtuallythat the German Fleet should be scrapped in the interests of security, and wehave a right to expect the minor Allies to acknowledge the wisdom of that policy. Moreover, the Royal Navy has in the past made generous provision forthe Allied Navies and is giving most sympathetic consideration to theiraspirations for further ships from United Kingdom construction. As pointedout in paragraph 4 above, it is of great importance that these Navies shouldequip themselves with British, not German types.. This policy, of course, carrieswith it some moral commitment to continue to look after the needs of the AlliedNavies and to be not too exacting in the financial terms upon which vessels aretransferred.15. I ask my colleagues to endorse the policy proposed in paragraph and the suggested division in paragraph 11. American support is essential ifwe are to succeed in our aims; I propose that the First Sea Lord should thereforetake an early opportunity of discussing the whole matter with Admiral King.16.   A separate memorandum has been prepared on the Italian Fleet, in- case the negotiations concerning the German Fleet lead to discussion regardingthe settlement of the Soviet claim against the Italian Fleet.B.
