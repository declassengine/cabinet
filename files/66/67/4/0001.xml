Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1945.CP. (45) 54.2&amp;th June, 1945.CABINET.THE NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME, 1945.Memorandum by the Eirst Lord of the Admiralty.1. The New Construction Programme which my predecessor placed beforetine War Cabinet in 1944, took account, first, of our estimated needs for finishingthe war in the Far East, and, second, of ships required to make a start towardsproviding a balanced and up-to-date post-war Fleet.2. This year the main concern of the Navy remains the build-up for theFar Eastern war, and I propose to press on with the construction of all ships on order which it is expected will complete before the assumed date of the end ofthe Japanese war.3. Construction of ships for the post-war fleet must continue unless weare to find ourselves after the war seriously deficient in important classes. Thisconstruction may, however, proceed in a more leisurely manner and I aim, byadjustments in the rate of building of approved programmes, to make availableshipyard capacity for reconstruction of the Merchant Navy in a number ofYards which have, during the war years, been employed mainly on warshipbuilding. If the demand for merchant ships lags, warship construction may bespeeded up.4. In this connection, it is pertinent to observe that if we are to securemore stable conditions in the shipbuilding industry after the war, and to maintain an adequate labour force, it will be necessary for the Admiralty to take a long-term view of our Naval building programmes. The problems involved are under examination in the Admiralty, who are deeply concerned in the futurewell-being of the industry. The turnover from war-time activity to peaceinvolves obvious difficulties : in particular we must provide for the rapid building of merchant ships of types urgently needed for the re-establishment of theMerchant Navy, and must avoid a too rapid falling off in production whenthe urgent merchant ship orders are fulfilled. What in effect I propose is touse the Naval orders for post-war delivery as a cushion to absorb so far as possiblethe shocks of transition.5. The main provision for the Japanese war and for the essential nucleus of the post-war Fleet has been made in earlier programmes. In view of theman-power situation and the demands of reconstruction, I do not wish to seekauthority for more than the bare minimum under both these categories, and the1945 New Construction programme is, therefore, a very modest one. Indeed,changes in the war situation have made it unnecessary to proceed with aconsiderable number of ships of approved programmes. A list of the cancel-lations during 1944 is in an Appendix.[30123] B
6. Since the 1944 New Construction Programme was approved, thefollowing additions have been made, Treasury sanction having been obtained forthe expenditure involved in each case : &apos;30 Landing Craft (L.C.M. (1)),22 Floating Docks,and a number of miscellaneous small craft.Outline of Programme.7.   The 1945 programme is as follows :-Preliminary work on Lion and Temeraire.1 Experimental Type Submarine.4 Escort Vessels.5 Surveying Ships.1 Cruiser dock, 2 L.S.T. clocks and 22 small floating clocks.A number of miscellaneous small craft.Battleships.8. Last year approval was given to revise the design of the Lion andTemeraire and to proceed with the construction of six 16&quot; turrets to enable theLion and Temeraire to be laid down with the ships of the 1945 programme ifpossible.   Design work on the ships and turrets has accordingly begun.9. Only our newest battleships are being sent to the Pacific, and in viewof the possibility of casualties among them and the age of the rest of our battlefleet, I consider that we can delay no longer steps to maintain our effectivestrength in Capital Units. I therefore feel justified in asking for cabinet approval to place orders as necessary to enable Lion and Temeraire to be laididown as early as possible. I hope this will be in 1946, but in any case I regardjit as important that their completion should not be delayed beyond the end of 1952.10. I propose that Conqueror and Thunderer should remain deferred forthe time being.A aircraft Carriers.11.   I do not propose any additions to programmes already authorised.The hope which my predecessor expressed last year that it might be possibleto execute the full Programme of Light Fleet Carriers approved in 1943 has not,however, been realised and I am afraid that the second four Carriers must be deferred for the time being.Cruisers.12. The only change in authorised programmes which I propose is thebuilding of the remaining ship of the &quot;Tiger&quot; Class approved in the 1941programme to the 1944 design. I shall aim at ensuring the completion of thisship and the cruisers of the 1944 programme by 1950.Destroyers.13. Present arrangements should provide us with all the destroyersconsidered necessary for the Japanese war and with sufficient replacements tocarry us over the immediate post-war years.Submarines.14. The advance of the Americans in the Pacific has shortened Japanesecommunications and reduced the opportunities of, and accordingly the demandfor, submarines. It has, therefore, been found possible to cancel 37 &quot;A&quot; ClassSubmarines, 20 from the 1943 programme, 17 from the 1944 programme, andtwo &quot; T &quot; Class Submarines from the 1942 programme. I propose to build theremaining three Submarines of the 1944 programme to an improved &quot; A &quot; Classdesign.I consider it imperative that we should exert ourselves to catch up with recentrevolutionary German developments as soon as possible and I accordingly seekapproval for the construction of one submarine of new and experimental type inwhich it is hoped to develop improvements in underwater performance.
Escort Vessels.15. I ask approval to proceed with the design of four escort vessels of a new type, each of about 1,400 tons and with a speed of about 25 knots. These ships are largely for experimental purposes; two will be finished as A/S vessels andtwo as A/A ships.Floating Docks.16. My proposals provide for the construction of one Cruiser dock inCanada, two docks for landing ships and twenty-two docks for small craft. Allthese docks are required for the repair of ships taking part in the war in theFar East.Surveying Ships.17. As soon as Mine Clearance permits, it will be necessary to embark on an extensive programme of Surveying embodying accurate charting of the manywrecks around our coasts the complete re-survey of all Estuarial Waters and extensive work overseas in all areas normally used by British shipping. I there-fore ask approval to build five surveying ships of about 1,400 tons, to provide one in each of the areas Home, Mediterranean, West Indies, Africa, and NewZealand waters. I propose to lay down three of these ships as soon as possible,and the remaining two as convenient so as to complete not later than 1950.Small&apos;Craft.18. I seek approval in the normal way for the large number of miscellaneoussmall craft required to serve the Fleet and to carry out various other necessaryduties.19.
