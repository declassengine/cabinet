Printed for the Cabinet, July 1945.CRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 68.7th July, 1945.CABINET.AN EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL ORGANISATION OF THEUNITED NATIONS.THE Conference of Allied Ministers of Education, which was called together on the initiative of my predecessor two and a half years ago, has been engaged partly in considering practical measures to&quot;meet the urgent educationalneeds of liberated countries and partly in plans for the establishment of a continuing organisation for co-operation in the educational and cultural field. a wide measure of support for the proposal of such an organisation has beenobtained from the Governments associated with the Conference, and notably fromthe United States Government.2. The Conference, with the collaboration of the United States state department, has drafted a constitution for the proposed organisation. It is contemplated that the organisation shall be one of the specialised organisations,to be associated with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.The draft constitution is not finally settled, but there is to be a meeting of theConference of Allied Ministers on Thursday next, the 12th July, at which thedraft will be considered, and a final document agreed by the Conference.3. The next step proposed by the Conference of Allied Ministers is thatthere should be a meeting in London in November of representatives of theGovernments of the United Nations. At this meeting the draft constitution wouldbe examined and amended, and subsequently circulated to Governments for formaladoption. It is proposed that the constitution shall come into effect when twentyGovernments have notified their acceptance of it.4. The action proposed by the Conference of Allied Ministers is in harmony with the declaration approved at San Francisco, supporting the calling of a united Nations Conference to take steps towards the establishment of a united nations organisation in the educational and cultural field.5. The Conference of Allied Ministers has already, on the motion of theUnited States representative, requested His Majesty&apos;s Government to call ameeting in London for this purpose on its behalf. I propose to inform theConference when it meets on the 12th July that His Majesty&apos;s Government are willing to take this action.6. The urgency of the matter, in my view, arises largely from the factthat the French Government, who are much inclined to exaggerate the importanceof the value of the Institute of Intellectual Co-operation, have shown signs them-selves of an intention to call a conference in Paris with a view to the establish-ment of a United Nations organisation for education and culture. This wouldbe repugnant not only to ourselves but also, I believe, to the United States andto many of our smaller Allies. We do not want the French to take the initiativeout of our hands in this way, nor do we want to see the new organisation takino-shape under the predominating influence of France.   Its formation will be theMemorandum by the Minister of Education.[30189]
logical outcome of the work of the Allied Minister&apos;s Conference, of which theFrench have been fully co-operating members, under my predecessors guidanceover the past two years.7. I shall of course consult my colleagues before there is any question ofthe formal adoption of the Constitution by His Majesty&apos;s Government, or any financial commitment to the proposed new organisation.8. I ask authority at present only to make an announcement on July 12thof the willingness of His Majesty&apos;s Government to summon a meeting in london in the autumn.R. K. L.Ministry of Education, S.W. 1.7th July, 1945.
