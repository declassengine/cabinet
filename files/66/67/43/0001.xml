rilS BRITANNIC majesty  &apos;S GOYKRNMKMTPrinted for the Cabinet.   A ugust 1945.Copy No.   32CABINET.TANGIER.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE War Cabinet on the 23rd April considered a memorandum on Tangierby Mr. Eden and approved Mr. Eden&apos;s recommendations that discussions shouldbe opened with the United States Government and then with the FrenchGovernment with a view to :  (1) Preparing a joint communication to the Spanish Government calling on them to withdraw their illegal administration from the Zone;(2) Agreeing on the modifications to be made to the existing Tangier Statuteto cover the interim period pending the negotiation of a fresh treaty;and(3) Arranging for the summoning of an international conference to determine the final form which the regime should take.The War Cabinet accepted Mr. Eden&apos;s recommendation that the Soviet Govern-nient should not be invited to participate in the new Tangier regime, but thatthey should be informed of our plans at the appropriate moment.2. Discussions were duly held with the United States Government, andwhen broad agreement had been reached with them, arrangements were made to begin tripartite discussions in Paris on the 3rd July. On the 2nd July, however,the Soviet Government, who had been duly informed of the position, requesteda postponement in order that Soviet representatives might participate. the conversations were adjourned pending consideration of this request, which wrasfinally agreed to. A formal invitation has accordingly been made to the SovietGovernment by the British and French Embassies in Moscow, and conversationsare due to start in Paris immediately.3. The annexed memorandum sets out the draft instructions for the british delegation to the Paris talks. These draft instructions are for the most partself-explanatoiy, but two points require some explanation : (a) Arrangements for the termination of the illegal Spanish regime.Some stress is laid in the draft instructions on the importance of ensuring the peaceful departure of the Spanish administration and armed forces fromthe Zone, and the avoidance of any recourse to force. If the approach to theSpanish Government is such as to constitute a rebuff to Spanish national pride,there is an undoubted danger that the Spaniards may refuse to withdraw quietly.I am satisfied, however, that a resort to force must be avoided if possible as itwould be contrary to our interests and would be likely to lead to serious complica-tions. Tangier is surrounded by Spanish Morocco, where a certain part ofthe Spanish army is established, and the forcible ejection of the Spaniards fromTangier would involve quite an impressive minor operation. Besides, it would almost certainly involve a breach of relations with Spain, which would interruptour steadily developing trade with Spain (wdiich is important for financial reasons) and would jeopardise supplies of essential raw materials (iron ore. potashand pyrites) and food-stuffs from Spain. We should, moreover, find ourselvessaddled with the task of sending essential supplies to the Tangier Zone, wdiichat present depends on Spain for its food.12866   [30303]SECRET.CP. (45) 93.3rd August, 1945.
(b) The participation of the Spanish Government at the international conference.4. It is to be expected that the Soviet delegation will oppose the participation of the Spanish Government in the full-scale conference. T am of the opinionthat the British delegation should hold out for Spanish participation. however much we dislike the present regime in Spain, we recognise it as the Governmentof Spain, and we cannot overlook the fact that there are important Spanishinterests in the Zone and that the Spanish community is by far the largest whitecommunity there. These interests cannot be ignored. Besides I must once againstress the importance of not provoking the Spaniards into refusing to withdrawquietly from the Zone. If. however, the Spanish Government were, out of pique,to refuse to participate in the conference, then we should be perfectly entitled togo ahead without them, and there could be no possible complaint from the Spanishside at such a course.o.   I would recommend to the Cabinet the approval of the draft instructions.E. B.Foreign Office, 3rd August, 1945.ANNEX.Draft Instructions for the British Delegation to the Four-PowerConversations regarding Tangier in Paris.1. The Delegation should press for agreement to the holding at the earliestpossible date of a conference in Paris of all the Tangier Powers, plus the UnitedStates and the U.S.S.R., for the purpose of negotiating a new Tangier Statute.If, as is to be expected, the Soviet Delegation object to the present SpanishGovernment being represented at this full-scale conference, the British delegation should point out that there are considerable Spanish interests in the Zone andthat, although they are not in sympathy with the present Spanish regime, they recognise it as the Government of Spain and they do not see how a conferenceregarding Tangier can properly be held without representatives of the SpanishGovernment. The Delegation should, in fact, insist on the Spanish government being invited to the full-scale conference. If it should prove impossible to obtain agreement on this point, they should refer back to London for instructions.2. The Delegation should recommend the immediate establishment of asuitable provisional regime to take the place of the present Spanish adminis-tration and to administer the Zone pending the conclusion of the new Statute.They should, moreover, endeavour to secure agreement on a satisfactory procedure for the transition from the Spanish administration to a provisional internationaladministration, taking into account the importance of ensuring the peacefuldeparture of the Spanish administration and the Spanish armed forces fromthe Zone and of the avoidance of any recourse to force.As regards the interim regime, the French Government are known to be anxious that this should be based fairly closely on the 1923 regime (subject tominor modifications) and it may be necessary to agree to this. It would, however,be preferable if agreement could be obtained to the introduction in the interim period of a much simpler regime which would in effect leave the administration ofthe Zone in the hands of the French and British Governments, or possibly theFrench, British and Spanish Governments. The United States Delegation fortheir part may press for the immediate participation of the United StatesGovernment and the Soviet Government in the interim administration, butit would be far preferable, as being less objectionable both to the SpanishGovernment and the other Tangier Powers, if agreement could be obtained tothe effect that United States and Soviet participation should be deferred untilthe introduction of the new permanent regime, on the understanding that thiswould be negotiated as soon as possible.As regards the arrangements for the withdrawal of the Spanish adminis-tration, the delegation should endeavour to obtain agreement that the approach to the Spanish Government should be left to His Majesty&apos;s Government and theFrench Government, seeing that the United States Government and the SovietGovernment, which are not yet Tangier Powers, have no real, locus standi in thematter.
3. The Delegation should insist on the inclusion of a British contingentin the troops to be stationed in the Zone during the interim period for the purposeof maintaining order. It is known that the French Government are anxious thatthese troops should be Shereefian troops, but there is a serious danger that thepresence of Shereefian troops or French troops alone might provoke disturbances.A possible satisfactory arrangement would be the despatch of three equalcontingents of Shereefian, French and British, troops. If it is possible to secure agreement to the inclusion of a Spanish contingent this would be calculated tofacilitate the change-over and render it less humiliating to the Spaniards.4. The Delegation is authorised in the last resort to agree to an advance of up to  25,000 from His Majesty&apos;s Exchequer for the purpose of setting the finances of the Zone on a proper footing during the interim period on the under-standing : (a) that corresponding contributions are made by the other interested parties; (b) that such advances would be a first charge on the finances of the Zone.The Delegation should, however, propose as a more desirable alternative that inthe first instance an effort should be made to induce the Spanish Governmentto make the necessary advances.
