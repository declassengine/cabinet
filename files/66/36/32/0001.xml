A U-boat was destroyed by a Liberator (B. 24) aircraft south-west of iceland (C) on the 23rd and another was destroyed by a Fortress (B. 17) southof Iceland (C) on the following day. In each case a number of the crew was seen in the water. On the 25th, a U-boat was sunk in mid-Atlantic byHALS. Pathfinder (destroyer) after an attack by aircraft from HALS. Biter(escort carrier). Six officers and 37 ratings were taken prisoner. On the 21st,H.M.S. Hastings (sloop), escorting an outward convoy, probably sank a U-boatsouth of Greenland.Fifty other attacks have been reported during the week : 41 by aircraft, 1! by surface craft and two by submarines. One of the attacks by air-craft probably damaged a U-boat.It is now known that a U-boat was destroyed by two US. aircraft north of st. paul&apos;s Rocks on the 15th.    .6. Between the 13th and the 28th, aircraft made 29 sightings and 17 attacks in the Bay of Biscay.
Enemy Intelligence.German.7. The A admiral Scheer and Graf Zeppelin were seen by photographic reconnaissance on the 22nd at Swinemunde. A Russian photographic reconnaissance on the 25th reported the Tirpitz with three cruisers (presumablythe Scharnhorst, Lutzow and nurnberg) and three destroyers in Kaafiord (Tromsoarea).Italian.8. Convoy traffic to Tunisia decreased by 4,000 tons. Destroyers are againbelieved to have carried German troops to Tunis.Two Italian U-boats are reported to be undergoing conversion at Bordeauxfor cargo-carrying to Japan.Japanese.9. Air reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 23rd showed 48 merchant ships, ofan estimated total of 121,000 tons, although a further reconnaissance on the 26thshowed 23 merchant ships totalling 110.000 tons.The heavy cruiser of the Aoba class which was damaged by aircraft atKavieng on the 4th is still beached, and photographs show heavy damage to hersuperstructure.U-boats.10. The refit of U-boats in Biscay ports appears to be taking longer thanformerly.In the areas south of Greenland and between Greenland and Iceland (C) morethan 50 U-boats are estimated to have been operating against four convoys duringthe week. Two U-boats are active south of the Cape and about six others are believed to be on passage to this area.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11.   During the week eliding midnight the 25th, 944 ships were convoyed..Of these 222 were in ocean convoys and 722 in British  coastal convoys.Seventy-eight destroyers (including 15 U.S. destroyers), 123 sloops, cutters,corvettes and frigates (including one U.S. sloop), one escort carrier, two armed merchant cruisers and one ocean boarding vessel were employed on escort duties.During the week 116 ships in four convoys arrived in Home Waters; one ship was lost.12. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekended the 24th totalled 1.004,000 tons compared with 577.000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 692,400 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 309,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked six ships, ofwhich three are known to have sunk. In addition, one ship was sunk and anotherdamaged either by U-boat or mine off Casablanca.3 One ship in a homebound Atlantic convoy was torpedoed east of Greenland.A ship sailing independently was torpedoed west of Bermuda. In the south atlantic, a tanker was torpedoed south of Capetown. Three ships were sunk off the east coast of Australia.Aircraft acting with surface escort groups have again successfully wardedoff attacks by U-boats on North Atlantic convoys.British Wiinelaying.14.   During the week aircraft have laid mines extensively in the Baltic, offthe German North Sea coast and in the Bay of Biscay.Mines were also laid in the Central Mediterranean.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.15. Minelaying by aircraft took place on one night of the week off theEast Coast and possibly on a second night. No minelaying&apos; by E-boats has beenreported.[25350] b
Thirteen mines were destroyed, chiefly off the East Coast. The mine totalsnow are : 4,270 ground and 2,455 moored.vichy French Intelligence.16. Air reconnaissance of Spezia on the 17th showed two contre-torpilleursof the    Tigre &quot; class and a third, which is believed to be the Lion from Toulon.Enemy Merchant Shipping.17. There has recently been a large increase in the movement of enemvshipping from Roumania to ports in the Crimea and also in the traffic of small craft across the Kerch Strait.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map of the Tunis area is included as an inset.)Tunisia.Eighth A rmy.18. On the three days following the Eighth Army&apos;s attack on the Enfidavilleposition (19th/20th), fierce and confused fighting further inland won us the high ground in the area of Takrouna village. Further west, the dominating feature ofDjebel Garci changed hands several times, with our infantry maintaining a firmgrip on the southern slopes. The enemy massed a very considerable proportionof his whole force in an endeavour to prevent a break through in the directionof Hammamet.First A rmy.19. When the Eighth Army&apos;s attack was well under way and Axis forces had been concentrated eastwards to meet this threat, General Anderson, startingon the 22nd, launched two converging offensives in the Mecliez El Bab and theBou Arada sectors. The enemy had been aware of our offensive intentions m this area, and during the night 20th/21st had launched spoiling attacks; these, how-ever, were defeated with considerable loss to both his infantry and his armour.The bulk of our infantry, supported by Churchill tanks, pushed forwardalong the general line of the Aledjerda river. By the 23rd.. despite bitterresistance from the enemy garrison, whose front was covered by extensive mine-fields, the formidable obstacle of Longstop Hill was captured. Further to thesouth our infantry advanced in a north-easterly direction through Grich El Oued,and despite severe counter-attacks were holding a line roughly six miles east ofMedjez El Bab by nightfall.   Still further south Goubellat was occupied.Our armour operating north of Sebkret El Kourza made steady progress; bymidday on the 24th it had come under the fire of a strong enemy anti-tank gunscreen supported by some tanks north-west of Pont Du Fahs. During the day theenemy lost at least 16 tanks, and the remainder of his forces in this area were forced to withdraw still farther to the east. Our infantry also advanced againstvery fierce opposition all along the front and the ground previously gained wasconsolidated.By the 25th the village of Heidous, which had been outflanked by the capture of Longstop Hill, was finally reduced and its garrison forced to surrender.During the day a promising attack developed along the Medjez El Bab-Tunisroad, and this movement carried the line of our forward infantry on to someeight miles east of Medjez El Bab on a front from the Aledjerda River to theMedjez El Bab-Tunis road, inclusive. Meanwhile, the armoured battle north-west of Pont Du Fahs went on with unabated ferocity, and the enemy&apos;s tank strengthcontinued to be whittled down.On the following day, the 26th, our infantry advanced two miles along thewhole front from Djebel El Ang to the Medjez El Bab-Tunis road, whilst ourarmour continued to exert heavy pressure north-west of Pont du Fahs. during that day and the 27th fierce enemy counter-attacks were held, and along thesouthern bank of the Medjerda River a brilliant attack gained us a foothold onthe valuable dominating feature of Djebel Bou Aoukaz (seven miles S.W. ofTebourba).On the following day the whole feature was in our hands, but latertwo strong counter-attacks, supported by tanks, forced us slightly back from thehigh ground.
French Forces.20. Meanwhile, the main portion of the enemy&apos;s forces and all his armour,which had concentrated to prevent a break through by either the First or the eighth Armies, left the sector south of Pont Du Fahs in which the French troopswith the First Army are operating with very little opposition. Over this most difficult country the French forces have advanced to within a very few miles ofPont du Fahs and have made, contact with the left flank of the Eighth Army inthe area of Djebel Ben Saidane. They are now across the Pont Du Fahs-Djebibina road and infiltrating north-east into the Djebel Zagouan. the possession of this high ground by the French must compromise the Axis forcesfacing the Eighth Army in the coastal sector.IJ.S. Forces.21. In the Northern Sector U.S. forces, with French Colonial troopsoperating in the coastal area on their left flank, have made a most useful advanceover very difficult country. North of the Sedjenane-Mateur road, Kef Abbedand the dominating ground further south have been captured. Further south,Jefna is threatened, and Sidi Nsir fell to an outflanking movement which drovethe enemy from Djebel Meftah.The Russo-German Campaign.22.   Conditions have been quiet along the greater part of the Russian front.The only fighting of importance has taken place in the area of the TamanBridgehead. Here the Russian attacks against the eastern front of the Germanbridgehead continued, but have had no appreciable success. South-west ofNovorossisk the Germans made a number of attacks against the small bridge-head held by the Russians. In spite of very strong air support these attacksmade only slight progress and have now ceased.Burma.A arakan Front.23. During the past week the Japanese, maintaining their pressure on theArakan front, have continued to move northwards towards our positions coveringMaungdaw/Buthidaung. West of the Mayu River, there have been minorskirmishes only, but to the east of the ridge an enemy force, estimated at two battalions, attacked our positions at Seinnyinbya (13 miles S.E. of Maungdaw)on the 25th. This attack penetrated our outposts but was held up on our mainpositions.   The enemy suffered considerable casualties.Chindivin A rea.24. The increased enemy activitv reoorted in last week&apos;s Resume in thearea Ffomalin-Paungbyin has continued.AIR SITUATION.General Review.25. Night operations were limited to one heavy attack on Duisburg and the laying of a record number of sea-mines in enemy waters.Allied aircraft gave full support to our land forces in Tunisia and madeheavy attacks on ports and airfields in Italy, Sicily and Sardinia.United Kingdom.26. Two enemy aircraft flew over this country by day and 19 by night.Mosquitoes destroyed one and damaged another; a Beaufighter destroyed a thirdover the English Channel on its way to the English Coast.Coastal Operations.27. Escorted Whirlwind bombers attacked, off Jersey, a convoy comprisinga 1,500-ton ship, an armed trawler, a converted motor yacht, an E-boat and threebarges; the largest ship was set on fire and the six remaining vessels were damaged, two of them seriously. Off Brittany, escorted Whirlwinds bombed a convoy of eight minesweepers and armed trawlers; one minesweeper was probably sunk and damage was caused to a second and to one of the trawlers.[25350] b 2
Oft&apos; the Norwegian const, two ships of 3,000 and &quot;2,500 tens respectively, were torpedoed by Hampdens. A 4,000-ton ship was left with a heavy list after receiving at least three torpedo-hits by escorted Beaufighters which also effectivelyattacked&quot; her two escort vessels with machine-gun and cannon fire.A total of 330 aircraft of Bomber Command succesfully laid f.126 sea-mines in enemy waters. Twenty-six aircraft, of the 424 despatched on these missions,did not&quot; return, most of those casualties being to aircraft operating in theBaltic Sea.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.28. Activity was restricted to small-scale ope rations owing to unfavourable weather. In the course of attacks on transport targets in Belgium and northern france, two locomotives, seven barges, and lock-gates near Calais were destroyed and eight locomotives and 14 barges were damaged. In Nor.th-We.st Germanyrailway workshops were successfully attacked by Mosquitoes.Night.29. Bad flying weather prevented operations against land targets until the night of the 26th/27th, when, under favourable conditions, 499 bombers attacked the large inland port of Duisburg. The 1,502 tons of bombs which were releasedincluded 225 x 4,000-lb. II.Es.-the largest number of this type dropped on anyone night. Numerous fires were started, many of which took firm hold and developed well. Though the concentration tended to spread towards the east and east-north-east of the target, several large explosions, including one in the docks,were reported in the target area.   Seventeen aircraft are missing.Mediterranean.Italy, Sicily and Sardinia.30. Liberators (B. 24) made three attacks on Naples, dropping about 40 tonsof bombs; the quays, the railway station, the shipyards and the iron and steelworks were hit, and a fire was started near oil installations.The airfield at Bari was attacked twice by Liberators (B. 24), which dropped130 tons of bombs. Hits wrere obtained on all the hangars, on administrativebuildings and on aircraft, 18 of which were destroyed. Bombs were also dropped on Barietta (N.W. of Bari). The airfield at Grosseto (90 miles N.W. of Rome)was bombed by 52 U.S. Fortresses (B. 17); considerable damage was caused to the airfield and to buildings. Mosquitoes attacked road and rail transport inCalabria, damaging an electric train and several locomotive engines.In Sicily, escorted Spitfires bombed the harbours at Syracuse and Augusta.At Syracuse, the seaplane and E-boat bases, factories and warehouses were hit.and at Augusta the U-boat base and oil installations. Successful attacks were also made on a military camp at Pozzallo and on a factory at Marzemimi (on theS.E. Coast). Messina was twice bombed by U.S. heavy bombers; the ferryterminus and the railway yards were hit.The total of enemy aircraft destroyed by Malta-based aircraft since thebeginning of the war reached 1,001 when Spitfires shot clown two Ju. 52 overPalermo.In Sardinia, the airfields at Elmas, Decimommanu and Villacidro were heavily attacked by Allied heavy, medium and fighter bombers; several aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Escorted U.S. Marauders (B. 26) attacked the harbours at Carlo Forte, Port Romano and Arbatax.Sicilian Channel.31. Allied aircraft made several attacks on enemy shipping in the SicilianChannel. A 6,000-ton ship was sunk, another blew up and an Italian destroyer,two naval auxiliaries and three ships were probably damaged. Attacks were also made,on Siebel ferries; several were destroyed or damaged and an escort shipcapsized.Tunisia.32. Although the weather on some days of the week was unfavourable, theAllied Aii- Force gave our land forces the fullest support, attacking the enemy s
forward positions, his lines of communication and his airfields. On the 22nd,when the First Army&apos;s attack began, more than a thousand bomber and fightersorties were flown in spite of bad weather during the early hours of the attack.The record was reached on the 27th, when 1,796 sorties were flown.Medium, light and fighter-bombers continuously attacked enemy positions,guns and tanks in the forward areas. On the 22nd, escorted Bostons (A. 20)and Mitchells (B. 25) flew 128 sorties against enemy positions on Longstop Hill,and on the 23rd the same type of aircraft dropped 120 tons of bombs on theenemy in the Ksar Tyr area. Heavy attacks were also made on enemy concentrations in the back areas.Enemy road and rail communications received considerable attention, and alarge number of M.T. and railway vehicles were destroyed or damaged.Wellingtons dropped 36 tons of bombs on Bizerta goods yard.Heavy and concentrated bombing attacks were made on enemy airfields and landing grounds, especially at Soliman, Korba, St. Marie du Zit and El Ahmed.The airfield at Lampedusa was attacked by escorted Spitfires from Malta.Fighters carried out a large number of offensive sweeps. During one ofthese, Kittyhawks (P. 40E) and Spitfires intercepted a heavily escorted formationof Me. 323 (six-engined gliders) flying towards Tunis; 31 Me. 323 and 11 fighters were destroyed for the loss of four Kittyhawks. (There was an increase in enemy activity, but it was almost entirely on the defensive.Greece and Crete.33. Beaufighters attacked shipping off the coast of Greece; a sailing ship was sunk, a schooner was left sinking, two schooners and a caique were set on fire and two other small ships were damaged.A Wellington bombed Maleme airfield.Operational Sorties and Battle Casualties.34. During the week 9.556 sorties were flown in the Mediterranean area and the following casualties are reported : destroyed or Missing.    Damaged.Allied       ............... 69 46Destroyed.      Probable.      Damaged.Enemy    ...      .......      -   138 22 64No account is taken of aircraft destroyed on the ground.Russia.35.   Russian air activity was on a fairly heavy scale, especially in the south.On the Northern Front, Russian aircraft bombed the town of Kotka, onthe Gulf of Finland, three times; a patrol vessel and three landing craft w7eresunk and heavy damage was caused to port installations. Aircraft of the BalticFleet sank a U-boat off the Finnish Coast.On the Central Front, a heavy raid was made on an unspecified airfield;eight German aircraft were destroyed on the ground and three others were shot down.On the Southern Front, the Russian attacks were directed mainly against enemy airfields and railway stations; several trains and many aircraft on theground were destroyed.In the Caucasus, considerable air support was given to Russian troopsattacking the Novorossisk bridgehead, and heavy attacks were made on enemyairfields, villages and communications.Russian long-range bombers again raided towns in East Prussia, includingTilsit and Insterburg.The German Air Force operated in force over the Taman Peninsula and against Russian troops threatening Novorossisk, but the scale of operationsdeclined as the week progressed and the G.A.F. did not succeed at any time in securing definite air superiority. Longvrange bombers attacked Caucasianharbours, including Poti and Batum.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.39. No bombs were dropped by day. On the night 23rd/24th houses were damaged by bombs in Birmingham and there were minor incidents in Mont-gomeryshire, Devon, Somerset and Berkshire and from A.A. fire in Outer London.There were insignificant incidents on the night 24th/25th in Northamptonshire,East Anglia, Glamorganshire and Isle of Wight and on the 28th/29th nearSalisbury, in the New Forest, and in Sussex.Casualties.40. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours onthe 28th were 41 killed and 60 seriously injured (of these 41 killed and47 seriously injured were at Aberdeen on the night 21st/22nd in the attackrecorded in last week&apos;s Resume).36. Despite bad weather, an average of about 30 bomber and 30 fightersorties was maintained every day. These covered widely-separated targets fromRangoon to Myitkyina, and included some effective machine-gunning of japanese troops on the Mayu Peninsula and offensive operations in support of our land forces in the Upper Chindwin district.Heavy bombers dropped more than 60 tons of bombs in a series of attacks on Rangoon and nearby objectives. In addition, a total of nearly 100 tons was dropped by small formations of aircraft during harassing operations againstairfields, communications, supply dumps, oil refineries, river craft and other targets.   Accurate bombing was reported in nearly every instance.Japanese aircraft inflicted considerable damage at Imphal, Assam, whichwas attacked by 27 bombers escorted by 16 fighters. Later in the week, 12 bombersescorted by fighters destroyed six U.S. aircraft on the airfield at Yunnanyi(374 miles N.E. of Mandalay) and seriously damaged seven more.China Zone.37. Kittyhawks (P. 40) intercepted 25 Japanese aircraft near Lungling-(96 miles S.E. of Myitkyina). Our fighters shot down five and probably destroyed two others, without loss.Pacific Zone.38. Owing to poor weather over the whole area, operations against landtargets were restricted mainly to individual attacks by single aircraft. On one day, however, Kendari airfield (Celebes) was attacked by nine Liberators (B. 24);five aircraft on the ground and five in the air were destroyed. Other successesby U.S. Liberators (B. 24) included the sinking of a 7,000-ton ship 50 miles S.E.of Kavieng (New Ireland), hits on a medium-sized ship in Geelvink Bay, NorthernNew Guinea, and the destruction in combat by one aircraft on reconnaissance offive out of ten Japanese intercepting fighters. Hudsons (A. 29) sank two small ships off Kai and Sermata Islands respectively.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectivelycombining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in March 1943 these comprised 28 tankers of 224,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3)).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and EireCO

An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the21st April and covering all but the central districts (which are obscured by smoke from fires still burning at the time when the photographs were made) shows that40 acres of the Chemical Products factory in Pommernsdorf were devastated by fire. In the same district two sheds of a power station in the MarkischesElectricity Works were gutted, and in Schwarzow \\ acres of unidentifiedindustrial buildings were destroyed.Stuttgart -It is reported that, in the attack on the 14th/15th April, a factorymanufacturing ball-bearings was hit and over  100,000 worth of damage caused.The factory referred to is believed to be V.K.F. Norma in Bad Cannstadt.A further interpretation of photographs shows that altogether some 40industrial and commercial concerns have been affected. Barrack buildings were hit, the Generator house at the Town Power Station gutted, and over 400 housesdestroyed or damaged.Mannheim.-A further interpretation of photographs taken on the 18th Aprilshows that, in I.G. Farbenindustrie, three buildings were destroyed, six seriously damaged and twelve more-slightly damaged. Five and a half acres in JosephVogele A.G. (Tank and M.V. components) were devastated, as well as two acres in neighbouring factories.In the dock areas warehouses and transhipment sheds were destroyed andthere is severe damage to timber and other goods stacked in the yards, and quays.Over 400 residential or commercial buildings, including over 60 large blocks of flats or offices, were destroyed and more than 300 others damaged.
Essen. It is known that, after the attack on 3rd/4th April, the militaryauthorities asked those at Dusseldorf how many homeless families they couldaccommodate temporarily. The answer was: &quot; Impossible to help, as we have18,000 uninhabitable apartments.&quot;The Mayor of Essen announced the following extra distributions of foodduring the third week of April : (a) 500 grams of oranges; (b) for families with three or more children,250 grams of corned wild boar against the fish coupon C, and(c) that during the next few days some geese and ducks would be distributed.(German Press.)Note. These distributions are in excess of those so far delivered to otherheavily raided areas.General. The authorities are perturbed by the breakdown of civilianadministration which has followed our most severe attacks!, such as those onEssen and Nuremberg. In both these places, the problems of relief, alternative accommodation, evacuation and food supplies were only solved in a make-shiftway. It is said that the question of how to avoid a complete breakdown in the municipal administration of heavily attacked cities was the main subjectdiscussed at Goebbels&apos; recent conference in Essen.The Soviet official communique of 25th April, after referring to recentarticles by Goebbels that the morale of German civilians had not been affected by recent R.A.F. attacks, states that this assertion is completely disproved by lettersfound on German soldiers captured or killed on the Russian Front. Among the letters quoted was one from Berlin which stated : &quot; If you take a tram ride to Wilmersdorff you could imagine yourselfin Stalingrad, such is the extent of the damage.&quot;France.Billancourt. The U.S.A.A.F. attack on the Renault Works achieved con-siderable success and it is at present estimated that three months will elapse before anything approaching normal production will be possible.The turning-shop received two direct hits. Two-thirds of the lathes were rendered unserviceable and the remainder need repair. The transmission beltingwas cut and the roofing collapsed. The shop for finished lorries received sixdirect hits, resulting in 25 per cent, of the lorries being rendered useless, 25 percent, being damaged but repairable, the remainder being serviceable. Thejoinery shop was completely wrecked by four direct hits. The spare parts storeand the workmen&apos;s rest room and canteen were destroyed.Transformer Stations. Photographs taken on the 18th April, after anattack by aircraft of Army Co-operation Command on the transformer stations at Le Theil and La Loupe which serve the Paris-Le Mans electric railway line,show : -(1) That at Le Theil one transformer and the low-tension breakers were completely destroyed, and(2)   That at La Loupe damage was caused to the low-tension circuit breakersand to the rectifier house.A ground report has been received in connection with the damage inflicted on the three important French transformer switching stations at Creney, Chaingyand Distre as a result of the attack by aircraft of Army Co-operation Commandon the night of the 19th/20th February last. The raid appears to have been very successful and supplies&apos; of power to Paris from hydro-electric power stations were cut off for four days. &quot;According to the report, considerable damage was done to transformer and switchgear and to protective devices, and, whilst supplieshave been re-established, this has only been done at the expense of certain safetydevices. As a result, the operation of the electrical network to ensure supplies of power from hydro-electric power stations to Paris has been rendered much moredifficult, and dangerous. As the thermal power stations in the Paris area only have a limited, reserve of coal supplies, the complete cutting off of externalsupplies could have very serious results in depriving industrial undertakings inthe Paris area working for the Germans of their vital electrical supplies.[25350]c
Italy.Spezia.-&apos;A further interpretation of photographs taken on the 19th Aprilshows that altogether 27 buildings in the Naval Dockyard were damaged, 23 ofthem severely. It is also seen that a destroyer of the Aviere/Oriani class, whichwas berthed off the Molo Italia, was sunk. It is reported that a direct hit on afuel clump was responsible for a great part of the damage in the Naval Yards.In the attack of the 13th/ 14th April, a few aircraft bombed targets on thewestern side of the Gulf of Genoa, results being unobserved. It is now reportedthat, on the 14th April, railway communication between Ospedaletti and SanRemo was stopped and that repair work was&quot; expected to take at least 48 hours.
