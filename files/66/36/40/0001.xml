Brothers and sisters, temporarilysuffering under the yoke of the German oppressors.In the name of the Soviet Government and our Bolshevik Party, I greet andcongratulate you on the day of the 1st May.In the grim days of the war for the Fatherland, the peoples of our country are marking the day of the 1st May. They have entrusted their fate to theRed Army, and they were not mistaken in their hopes. The Soviet warriors have risen to the defence of their Fatherland, and for almost two years they have beenfighting for the honour and independence of the peoples of the Soviet Union.During the period of the winter campaign of 1942-43, the Red Armyinflicted serious defeats on the Hitlerite troops, annihilated a tremendousquantity of the man-power and technical equipment of the enemy, encircled andliquidated two armies of the enemy, at Stalingrad, took prisoners over 300,000enemy soldiers and officers, and liberated from the German yoke hundreds of soviet towns and thousands of villages.The winter campaign demonstrated that the offensive power of the Reel army has increased. Our troops have not only dislodged the Germans from the territory which they had seized in the summer of 1942, but have also occupied a numberof towns and districts which had been in the hands of the enemy for about one and a half years. It proved beyond the strength of the Germans to preventthe offensive of the Red Army.Even for a counter-offensive on a narrow sector of the front in the Kharkovarea, the Hitlerite Command was forced to transfer more than 30 fresh divisions from Western Europe. The Germans intended to encircle the Soviet troops inthe Kharkov area and to arrange for our troops a German Stalingrad. the attempt of the German High Command, however, to take revenge for Stalingradfell through.Simultaneously, the victorious forces of our Allies defeated the Italian andGerman troops in Libya and Tripolitania, cleared these provinces of the enemy and are now continuing to crush him in the area of Tunis, while the gallantAnglo-American air forces are inflicting smashing blows at military andindustrial centres in Germany and Italy, heralding the setting up of a second front in Europe against the German and Italian Fascists. Thus the blow inflicted[25387]
on the enemy from the East by the Red Army has been merged for the first timein the war with the blow from the West by the troops of our Allies into a single,united blow.All these circumstances taken together have shaken the foundations of theHitlerite military machine, have changed the course of the world war and have established the indispensable conditions for victory over Hitlerite Germany. Asa result, the enemy was forced to admit a serious deterioration of his position, andbegan wailing about a military crisis.It is true that the enemy is striving to conceal his critical situation by thefuss of total mobilisation. Hut no such fuss can change the fact that the Fascistcamp is really living through a serious crisis.The crisis in the Fascist camp is primarily expressed in the fact that theenemy saw himself forced to renounce openly his initial calculation on a lightning-war, ft is no longer fashionable in the enemy camp to talk of lightning war.Loud prating of lightning war has now given place to gloomy laments about theinevitability of a prolonged war. -Whereas formerly the German FascistCommand bragged of tactics of lightning offensive, now these tactics have been thrown aside and the German Fascists are no longer boasting about their havingachieved, or their intending to achieve, a lightning offensive, but of their havingsucceeded in having cunningly escaped from an encircling blow by British troopsin North Africa, or from encirclement by Soviet troops in the area of Damyansk.The Fascist press is full of boastful reports that German troops succeeded inrunning away from the front and having escaped a new Stalingrad on one orother of the sectors of the Eastern or Tunis fronts. Evidently Hitler&apos;s strategistshave nothing else to boast about.The crisis in the Fascist camp is also expressed in the fact that the Fascistsare increasingly frequently talking of peace. If we judge by reports of theforeign press, we may arrive at the conclusion that the Germans would like tomake peace with Britain and the United States on the condition of theirabandoning the Soviet Union, or, on the contrary, they would like to make peacewith the Soviet Union on the condition of its abandoning Britain and the UnitedStates. Being treacherous to the marrow of their bones, the German Imperialistshave the impudence to measure the Allies by their own yardstick, thinking thatone of the Allies may swallow the bait. It is clear that it is not because of theirfavourable position that the Germans are prating about peace. This pratingof peace in the Fascist camp merely testifies to the fact that they are going through a severe crisis. On what peace can there be talk with the fmperialistrobbers from the German Fascist camp, who have flooded Europe with blood andhave covered it with gallows? Is it not clear that only the complete smashingof the Hitlerite armies and unconditional capitulation of Hitlerite germany can bring peace to Europe ? Are not the German Fascists talking of peace becausethey feel the approach of the coming catastrophe? The German-Italian Fascistcamp is going through a severe crisis and is facing its catastrophe.This does not mean, of course, that the catastrophe of Hitlerite Germany hasalready come. It does not mean it. Flitierite Germany and her army have beenshaken and are living through a crisis, but they are not yet defeated. It wouldbe naive to think that the catastrophe will come by itself, through the flow ofevents. Two or three such mightly blows are needed from the east and the west,like those inflicted on Hitlerite Germany during the last five or six months inorder to make the catastrophe of Hitler&apos;s Germany a fact. For this reason, the peoples of the Soviet Union and the Red Army, as well as those of our Allies amitheir armies, still have before them severe and grim fighting until final victory over the Hitlerite criminals is achieved. This struggle will require from themgreat sacrifices, enormous self-discipline and iron stubbornness. They mustmobilise all their forces and means to defeat the enemy and thus pave the way for peace.Comrades, the Soviet people are taking the greatest care of their Red Army.They are ready to give all their forces to increase the military power of the Sovietcountry. In less than four months, the nations of the Soviet Union have con-tributed to the fund of the Red Army more than seven milliard roubles. Thisproves once more that the war against the Germans is really a war of the peopleof all the nations inhabiting the Soviet Union. Workers, collective farmers,intelligentsia, are working in industrial enterprises, offices, in transport, in collec-tive and in State farms, without rest, stubbornly and courageously bearing all theprivations imposed by the war. But the war against the German Fascist usurpersrequires that the Red Army should get even more guns, tanks, planes, machine-guns, automatic rifles, mortars, ammunition, equipment and food supplies.   This
means that it is necessary for workers, collective farmers, all Soviet intelligentsia,to work for the front with doubled energy. It is necessary that all our people and all the institutions in the rear should work together and precisely, like goodclockwork.Let us remember the legacy of the great Lenin : &quot; Once the war has become inevitable, everything for the war, and the slightest easy-going lack of energymust he punished by martial law.&quot; In response to the confidence and to the care of her people, the Red Army must beat the enemy with even greater firmnessand exterminate the German usurpers mercilessly and chase them from the Sovietland without respite.The Red Army has acquired in the course of the war great militaryexperience. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers have mastered the use of their arms with perfection. Many commanders have learned to direct their troopswith skill on the battlefield. It would, however, be unreasonable to be lulled intosatisfaction by this. The men must master the use of their weapons well. the commanders must become masters of the direction of their troops. But even thisis not enough. In military affairs, and even more so in such a matter ascontemporary warfare, one cannot remain static. To stop in military mattersmeans to lag behind, and those who lag behind are, as is well known, usuallybeaten. Therefore the main thing at present is that the whole of the Red army should perfect its military training and skill, day by day, that all commandersand soldiers of the Reel Army should study the experience of the war and shouldlearn to wage war in such a way as is required by the cause of victory.Comrades, Red Army men and Red Navy men, commanders and politicalworkers, partisans men and women, greeting you and congratulating you with theday of 1st May, I order :  (1) All soldiers, infantrymen, mortar crews, artillerymen, tank troops,airmen, sappers, signallers, cavalrymen, to continue the perfection of theirfighting skill without respite, to fulfil the orders of their commanders and therules of the statutes and instructions with precision, to show sacred respect forthe maintenance of discipline and to keep order and good organisation.(2) The commanders of all kinds of arms and the general commanders ofthe troops to become masters of military leadership, to organise skilfully theco-operation of all kinds of arms and to direct them in battle, to study the enemy,to improve reconnaissance which is the ears and eyes of the Army, not to forgetthat the enemy cannot be beaten for certain without this, to improve the standardof the work of the troops&apos; headquarters, to achieve such a state in which the headquarters of units and army groups of the Red Army should becomeexemplary organs of the administration of troops, to improve the work of thetroops&apos; rear organisation to the level of the requirements put forward by modernwarfare, to remember without fail that the outcome of fighting operations depends on the complete and timely supply of the troops with ammunition, equipment and food supplies.(3) The whole of the Red Army to confirm and develop the successes of thewinter battles, not to surrender to the enemy a foot of our land, to be ready forthe decisive battles with the German Fascist usurpers, to show stubborness andfirmness in the defence which are characteristic of the troops of our Army,determination, correct co-operation of the troops, daring manoeuvres on the battlefield, which is crowned by the encirclement and the extermination of theadversary.(4) The partisans, men and women, to inflict powerful blows on the enemyrear, on the ways of communication, military stores, headquarters and industrialenterprises : to destroy the enemy communication lines : to draw large stratasof the Soviet population in the districts captured by the enemy into the activestruggle of liberation and by this to save Soviet citizens from deportation for german slavery and extermination &apos; by the Hitlerite beasts: to have mercilessvengeance on the German invaders for the blood and tears of our wives andchildren, our mothers and fathers, our brothers and sisters : to help the red army by all means in her struggle with the base Hitlerite enslavers.Comrades, the enemy has already learnt the force of the smashing blows ofour troops. The time is approaching when the Red Army, together with the armies of our Allies, will break the spine of the Fascist beast.Long live our glorious Motherland. Long live our gallant Red Army.Long live our gallant Red Navy. Long live our daring partisans, men andwomen.   Death to the German usurpers.
