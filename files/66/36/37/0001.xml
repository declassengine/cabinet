Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 187.May 4, 1943.WAR CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.THE importance of some preliminary discussion on the subject ofPalestine, which is raised in the Prime Ministers note W.P. (43) 178, will bevery generally recognised. This is not an issue that can indefinitely be postponed.Whatever may be our views as to the ultimate future of that distracted country,we must face the fact that in/M-ay 1944, twelve months from now, the five yearscovered by the immigration provisions&apos; of the White Paper of 1939 will come toan end. Some arrangement must be made for the immediate future, even if, asseems inevitable, a long-term political settlement is left over till the end ofthe war.2. The situation which will face His Majesty&apos;s Government next year is bound to be one of peculiar delicacy. If Jewish immigration is not brought toan end, wide sections of Arab opinion are likely to charge Great Britain with a breach of faith. On the other hand, it is surely impossible, especially in view ofthe unhappy situation of the Jews in Europe, to close one of their main channels of escape during the war. Whatever policy is adopted is likely to be attended by risks. I speak with great diffidence on this subject, for clearly only theColonial Secretary is in a position to judge trie developments in the situationwhich have occurred in recent months. But my personal view, subject to furtherinformation which may be in his possession, is that His Majesty&apos;s government must seek to freeze the situation as it exists at present, so that Jewish immigra-tion may be able to continue at the permitted rate beyond the five years coveredby the White Paper, until such time as conditions permit of a proper examinationof a long-term solution of the Palestine problem. No doubt any course whichmay be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government will lend itself to the interpretationboth by Arabs and Jews that our pre-war policy regarding Palestine is open-to modification. But at any rate both parties will know that the present regime,in which they have acquiesced, will continue for the immediate future, and weshall have a good chance of holding the position until our present anxieties inthe Middle East are over.3. It is, I suppose, inevitable that in any discussion by the Cabinet on palestine, however desirous we may be to keep our eyes on our immediate difficulties, more distant preoccupations must obtrude themselves. About along-term policy, I would only say this. I, like the Prime Minister, have alwaysheld the view that &quot; the absolute cessation of immigration into Palestine at the discretion of the Arab minority &quot; is contrary to the spirit and the letter of theMandate. I do not believe, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government canpermanently maintain the present policy. Whatever may be the ultimate policy adopted whether it be the creation of a Palestinian Jewish State with thepresent boundaries within an Arab Confederation; or a confederation of a more limited type, including Palestine, Transjordania, Syria and the Lebanon, whichcould absorb a larger number of Jewish immigrants, though it would not bea specifically Jewish State; or a partition of Palestine; or a reversion to CrownColony government whatever plan is finally agreed, there must not bediscrimination as between Arabs and Jews. That, I believe, is the only soundground on which we can stand, and I hope that that will be the basic principle which governs all our future examination of this problem.C.Givydyr House,Whitehall, S.W. 1,May 4, 1943.[25394]
