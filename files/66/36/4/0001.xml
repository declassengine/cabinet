(43) 82 of the23rd February last. Like that paper, the present report represents the agreedviews of the various Departments concerned with this question, including theService Departments.A. E.Foreign Offi.ce. April 14, 1943.MORALE IN GERMANY.SINCE, the last German morale report was circulated on the 23rd February(W.P. (43) 82), Hitler has reappeared on the public scene and announced on the21st March that the crisis in the East had been overcome and that the ban onarmy leave had been lilted. The military situation has, in fact, improved fromthe German point of view to the extent that the position on the Eastern Front hasbeen stabilised and Kharkov recaptured, while the Allied successes in Tunisiawill have been largely discounted in advance. As against this, Royal Air Forceraids have covered a wide area and have included outstandingly successful attacks on Essen and Berlin and heavy raids on Munich, Nuremburg andStuttgart. The general comb-out of man-power has continued. Generalvon Unruh has &quot;been appointed- Special Commissioner for Total Mobilisation.Schoolboys of the 1926 and 1927 classes are being used as air force auxiliariesand increasing numbers of women are being drafted into the factories. Regula-tions have been issued providing for the compulsory training of the entirepopulation in Air-Raid Precautions duties and enabling anyone to be impressedinto service after a raid. With the transfer of more S.S. men to the front, theforces of repression have been diluted by the formation of part-time town and rural guards. But the intensity of the repressive measures has been increased and greater publicity is being given to them to counter the tendency towards moreoutspoken criticism of the regime that has recently become apparent. Civilianstandards of living have been further reduced by a series of decrees which havemade consumption goods virtually unobtainable except for air-raid victims, whiletax increases, especially on the higher incomes and on company profits, have beenforecast.2. During this period German opinion lias been dominated by the war inthe East, by the day-to-day worries imposed by total war and by air raids. TheU-boat war (despite the efforts of the authorities to play it up), the fighting in africa, and even the prospect of the invasion of Europe, have played a far12010   [25309]
smaller part than might be assumed in influencing German minds. There hasbeen a general reaction from the shock administered by the defeat at Stalingrad,and, despite appeals by the authorities for &quot; no relaxation,&quot; the feeling has grown that the worst crisis of the winter has passed and that the threat from theEast has receded. This partial relapse into apathy has meant that the Govern-ment s total war propaganda has tended to yield diminishing returns. Therehave been reports of evasion of labour registration under the new mobilisationmeasures. There has also been considerable grumbling, especially among womendrafted into industry and among small shopkeepers whose businesses have been closed, and open resentment has been shown against both the Party and theAdministration. Moreover, there has been a marked increase in the misgivingsf,elt by both authorities and people about the presence of foreign workers. on balance, there has been no lessening of the strain and anxiety of daily life or ofthe tendency towards scepticism and speculation -which Avas noted in the lastreport as a new feature of German opinion.3. In this connexion evidence is accumulating of declining faith in Hitler&apos;disability to pull the nation through. These doubts are most marked among the wellinformed high officers, officials and party members, bigi industrialists and the professional classes who have less need than the rest of the population to leanupon an infallible leader. But the decline, relatively small though it be. in confidence among the masses, and the emergence of doubt among the loyal isgiving the authorities cause for concern. While the Euhrer&apos;s reappearance onthe 21st March will have tended to dispel the increasing rumours about his health,his manner cannot have been found reassuring.4. There is ample evidence that air attacks carried out in February and march have made a deep impression on German opinion. They have resulted ina sudden and in some cases severe decline in morale in the areas attacked and haveinduced a widespread sense of insecurity.5. It is significant that German propaganda has recently been stimulatinghopes of a compromise peace by insisting that there are influential sections inGreat Britain and the Unifed States who see eye to eye with Germany on thedanger of bolshevism. Rumours have also been circulating in Berlin that a negotiated peace with Russia may be expected in the early summer. Moralehas perhaps to some extent been stimulated by the raising of hopes that germany will be able to turn Allied disunity to her advantage; but there is now a wide-spread feeling that a German victory is impossible and the predominant moodis one of gloom. Fefr of the consequences of defeat remains the chief consoli-dating factor, but there are signs that the authorities realise that propagandaon this theme can be overdone.6. The danger of crisis in the higher ranks of the army and administrationmentioned in the last report has been tided over for the present. Stalingrad has given the Army High Command a chance to reassert itself, and they seem tohave recovered sufficient confidence to put forward again their own views on measures of major military importance. But the final decision still rests withHitler. On the other hand, antagonisms within the party have increased andthe power of Himmler and Goebbels has grown at the expense of Goring andRibbentrop. Although these divisions have so far been prevented from cominginto the open, public confidence is undoubtedly declining and the German Govern-ment will need to exert its strongest efforts to prevent further, disintegration onthe nation&apos;s will power. The strain is now such rjhat a major development suchas the collapse of Italy might have very great results.7. The fighting spirit of the armed forces has shown no further deterioration since the last report.
