this document is the property of his britannic majestvs governmentREPATRIATION OF SICK AND SERIOUSLY WOUNDED PRISONERSOF WAR AND CIVILIANS FROM THE BRITISH EMPIRE ANDGERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 14th September last year I circulated a Memorandum on this subject in which some account was given of a Swiss plan which had been proposed to both sides as a basis for discussion, and of the observations which had beenforwarded on behalf of the Governments of the Commonwealth to the swiss government.2. In the Swiss proposal both sides were asked to agree upon there patriation of all disabled men, medical and other non-combatant personnel andall civilians of both sexes and all ages who expressed a wish to - return, butexcepting those &apos;&apos; whose repatriation is considered to be dangerous to the securityof the detaining Power.&quot;&apos; It proposed that the seriously wounded and the medicalpersonnel should be exchanged before the civilians, and that women, children andmen over military age should come before other civilians. It did not contain any suggestion as to ways and means of carrying out the repatriation.3. When the Swiss proposal was under examination last summer in the prisoners of War Committee, agreement was reached on the following points :  (i) Rejection of any proposal which did not provide for the repatriationfrom each side of all persons eligible in accordance with its terms;in other words, we rejected repatriation on a head-for-head basis.(ii) Inclusion of all civilians, regardless of age or sex, so long as they expressed a wish to be repatriated.(iii) Definition of those civilians who must be excluded under the Swissexcepting clause quoted above; among these are included all officers.  and men of the Mercantile Marine.Of these points we informed the Swiss of (i); we told, them that we reservedour views upoh the question of including men of military age; and nothing was said to them about (iii).4. In spite of repeated reminders and representations by the swiss government during the succeeding months, the German Government made no-reply of any.kind. The Foreign Office and the War Office considered thepossibility of a fresh approach from our side, but, owing to the controversy overshackling, no favourable opportunity occurred for reopening this question.5. On the 19th March Mr. Norton reported the receipt by the Swiss Govern-ment of a further communication from the Germans on the subject of repatria-tion. This fact was reported to the Cabinet on the 22nd March, .when it wasdecided that discussion of the shackling question should be postponed until theGerman communication was received, when the two questions could be, considered together.Printed for the War Cabinet.

(i. A week later Mr. Norton received a copy of the German communication,which turned out to be the German Governments observations upon the Swissplan of last year. A copy of Berne telegram is annexed. It will be seen thatthe German Government has clearly stated its position on three important pointsas follows :  (a) The Germans require the inclusion of all civilians regardless of age orsex, subject to the excepting clause of the Swiss proposal.(b) They claim as civilians merchant seamen, unless they were in activemilitary service when taken prisoner.(c) They insist that the exchange shall take place on the basis of numericalequality, but &quot;without regard to the categories to which the differentrepatriated persons belong.&quot;The Swiss Government have asked to be informed as soon as possible of our attitude in regard to (a) and (b) and of our views generally.7. The German Government having taken this step while the shacklingquestion still remains unsettled, we now have an opportunity of making a further attempt to reach agreement upon the question of repatriation. There is ampleevidence to show that some of the sick and severely wounded in Germany are nowin a most deplorable state. This applies particularly to the blind, permanentcripples and the active tubercular cases; therefore His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare under a special obligation to make this attempt. What reply should be sentto the Swiss will largely depend upon what decision is taken with regard to thepoints mentioned in paragraph 6, and I propose, therefore, to take these in their order.8. (a) The question of civilian males of military age. We now know forcertain that the German Government attaches importance to the inclusion in any agreement of civilian men of military age. These were, in fact, included in the swiss plan of last year, subject only to the exclusion of all persons &quot; whoserepatriation is considered to be dangerous to the security of the detaining Power.&quot;Last summer we told the Swiss that on this point we would reserve our decision until the Germans had expressed their views on the Swiss plan. The questionof the inclusion of men of military age for purposes of exchange was, however,examined here and the Prisoners of War Committee eventually gave its approval to their inclusion, subject to the exceptions mentioned in the Swiss plan, if this step would help us to reach an agreement with the Germans. I think we must assume from the terms of the German communication that the German Govern-ment will not make any agreement unless His Majesty&apos;s Government declare their position with regard to men of military age, and unless they make some advance towards the German point of view on this question. Provided that, in accordancewith our present policy, all persons with special qualifications are excluded fromrepatriation, we are, it seems, in a position, if we wish, to tell the Swiss that we agree to the repatriation of all civilians so long as they express a wish to herepatriated, excepting those whose repatriation is considered to be dangerous tothe security of the detaining Power. The Prisoners of War Committee took theview that our requirements are safeguarded under the terms of the Swiss draft(see paragraph 2 above), and I am, therefore, in favour of withdrawing ourreservation on this point and agreeing to the inclusion of men of military age.9.  (b) The question of merchant seamen. The Germans claim as civiliansmerchant seamen unless they were in active military service when taken prisoner.The views of the Admiralty, whose attention has been drawn to this point, havenot yet been received. In fact, our merchant seamen in German hands are heldin prisoner of war camps and are for practical purposes assimilated to prisonersof war; German merchant seamen in our hands are also treated as prisoners ofwar. But, whether or not the German claim is well founded, the question oftheir status, if pursued, will inevitably involve protracted negotiations. Our aimmust be to bring matters now to a point at which either an agreement on thewhole question is reached and put into effect, or negotiations break down on ainattei&apos; which affects our vital interests. If, therefore, it is decided that ourpresent policy about merchant seamen must be maintained, I should be in favourI of making this clear at the outset to the Germans.10. (c) The question of the numerical basis of the exchange. The Germansmaintain their view that the exchange shall take place on the basis of numericalequality, but they make it clear that, provided the numbers correspond, they willexchange a British disabled prisoner for any kind of German, whether combatant,
non-combatant or civilian. On a numerical basis Germany holds more british prisoners of all kinds than the British Empire. It therefore holds more seriouslywounded and also more medical personnel, both of whom are entitled, under the conventions, to repatriation without regard to numbers, than German prisoners in these classes. This situation inevitably follows from the fact that in theearly stages of the war we were on the defensive, and I see no possibility, solong as this inequality of numbers persists, of the Germans agreeing to anyexchange except upon the basis of equal numbers. A choice must therefore bemade between accepting this basis and waiving our rights under the Conventionsor leaving our sick and severely wounded indefinitely in Germany. It may be argued that we should do nothing to compromise our position under the GenevaConventions, but I do not think that we should prejudice the Conventions as awhole by waiving our rights in this case, since the German attitude to it willbe governed by self-interest and not by any action taken by us. Moreover, inthis case we should gain nothing for our prisoners by asserting the rights whichthey possess under the Conventions, for these rights have proved to be valueless.I am, therefore, in favour of accepting the German proposal that the exchangeshall take place on a basis of numerical equality and without regard to the categories to which the different repatriated persons belong.11. If the views Avhich I have expressed on these three points are accepted,I suggest that our reply to the Swiss should include (i) We accept inclusion in the agreement of all civilians not excluding malecivilians of military age subject to the exceptions as defined in the swiss plan.(ii) We accept the principle of exchange on a basis of numerical equality,(iii) Subject to the views of the Admiralty, we cannot agree that merchant seamen should count in this connexion as civilians.I would also suggest that we should make a definite proposal for beginningthe exchange, which should take place through the two ports of Lisbon andSmyrna, as in the case of the Italian repatriation which is now being carriedout. I understand that the total numbers of German seriously wounded and medical personnel who are entitled to repatriation, and who can be offered at once,are respectively 450 and between 800 and 900. In return for these 1,300 Germanswe can claim a corresponding number of our seriously wounded, and I suggestthat we should do so, stipulating that the British group should include all themore serious cases. This would leave still in German hands approximately.600 seriously wounded, and I suggest that we should at the same time proposetheir transfer to Switzerland. Once there, their repatriation would be dealt withby means of a subsequent exchange, and we should offer to release german civilians or any other, seriously wounded or medical personnel who might by-then be available in equal numbers.A.

Mr. Norton to Mr. Eden.(No. 1506.)(Telegraphic.) Berne, March 29. 1943.MY immediately preceding telegram.The German Legation reply to the Swiss Government informs the latter ofobservations offered by the German Government on Swiss avant-projet, text ofwhich was forwarded in my despatch No. 1572 of last year.Observations are as follows : First paragraph : the German Government suggest inclusion of words &quot; aridas soon as military exigencies permit,&quot; and adds in substance : British medical and sanitary personnel is detailed for the care of sick and wounded british prisoners. The same applies to German medical and sanitary personnel in egypt and elsewhei&apos;e. Since Article 12 of the Geneva Convention of 1929 &quot;contemplatesa special agreement for return of sanitary personnel, the German government consider the following [group undecipherable] conform to objectives of that agreement : one military doctor and six protected personnel should be exceptedfrom repatriation per thousand prisoners. This personnel, which will remain for the care of its own compatriot prisoners should,primarily be formed fromvolunteers. If the number of volunteers is inadequate, detaining Power, inagreement with protecting Power, will designate the remainder with thefollowing determining criteria : capacity, age, duration of internment, state ofhealth, and family responsibilities. The same proposals are made as regardschaplains, of whom one per thousand should remain. Doctors, chaplains andsanitary personnel remaining would continue to benefit by privileged treatmentaccorded by the Geneva Convention.Second paragraph, the end of the second sentence : the German Governmentdesires the addition of &quot;or in territories occupied by British forces.&apos;&apos;It is added that the German Government consider it should be made clearthat the obligation on the Governments to facilitate repatriation of civiliansapplies to all who desire to be repatriated without consideration of sex or age.This, however; does not affect the exception stipulated in the third paragraph\sic] of the second paragraph.The German Government further consider it necessary to make it clear thatmerchant seamen count in this connexion as civilians unless they were in activemilitary service when taken prisoner.Third paragraph : the German Government regard the concludingsubordinate clause as redundant and suggest its omission.Fourth paragraph : the German Government consider it suitable that theexchange should be canned out &apos;through neutral jports; Lisbon and Smyrna&quot;enter into consideration as such/&apos; The German Government would grant safe-conduct to ships conveying repatriated persons on behalf of States participating in the war on their side as well as on their own behalf in respect of journeys fromterritory of detaining Power towards the exchange port and also vice versa. TheBritish Government should undertake the same -engagement. The exchangeshould be placed under guarantee of the Swiss Government in such a way thatthe return of repatriated persons leaving the neutral exchange port for theirrespective countries should only take place when authorised by the protecting power. Participating neutral Governments should give a similar guarantee.The exchange should take place on basis of numerical equality without regardto categories to which the different repatriated persons belong. The GermanGovernment consider it desirable that repatriation should begin immediatelyafter the conclusion of the agreement.Paragraph 5 : the German Government agree. They consider that theBritish Government, before exchange is begun, should make declaration making it clear that all parts of the British Empire, including those which have theirown Governments, are bound by the exchange plan.Text follows by Swiss bag.
