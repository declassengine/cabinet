THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 170.April 22, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH 1943 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.POLITICAL interest in Canada centred during the month chiefly on plans for social security. Early in March a special Parliamentary committee wasappointed to consider national social insurance, and later received the social security Report of Dr. Leonard Marsh, which purports to contain comprehensiveplans for social security and the provision of a &quot; national minimum.&quot; On the16th Mr. Ian Mackenzie, Minister of Pensions, produced a draft HealthInsurance Bill, which is intended to be accompanied by a broad programme ofhealth measures. Social legislation has been held back in Canada bv defects inthe Federal constitutional system, but the Government now propose to proceedwith the drafting of a model Bill for Health Insurance, which it is honed theProvinces will adopt.2. The conscription agitation has died down, as evidence accrues that canada is at present able to take a full part in the war without resorting to conscription, which might split the country. The Prime Minister has privatelyexpressed to the High Commissioner his confidence in this probability. Thepublic now realise that man-power shortage affects agriculture, mining andindustry, rather than the armed forces.3. The question of post-war reconstruction is receiving remarkable attention from industrialists and financiers. Many associations and firms representativeof these interests have been publishing their views and schemes on this subject,which are all characterised by opposition to State planning and socialism in any form, although they concede that some measure of social insurance is advisable.The views of the English &quot; Society of Individualists ,: and Unilever&apos;s programme are often quoted. Labour and Trades Union interests are strongly opposed tosuch policies, but have few channels through which to publicise their own views.4. Canada, with her strategically important position, is vitally interested inUnited States control of international air routes after the war, and some suspicion of United States ambitions exists, while, in the matter of the formation of theR.A.F. Air Transport Command, one paper expressed great annoyance that britain had been allowed to assume control of the Britain-Canada air route.5. The labour situation presents the anomaly of severe shortage inagriculture, mining, and lumbering, with the prospect&apos; of considerable lay-offs insome war industries owing to changes of programme, completion of construction,&amp;c. The Unions and the industrialists are at daggers drawn over the questionof collective bargaining rights, particularly in Ontario. The formation of labour-management committees is being encouraged, but there is not much evidence, sofar, that they have resulted in increased efficiency or better relations.
6. The Minister of Finance brought down his 1943-44 Budget on the2nd March. Canadian war expenditure is expected to increase from 4-i- billiondollars to 5 J billion during the coming year, staggering figures when comparedwith the pre-war expenditure. This great effort will not, however, be financedwithout some measure of inflation.7. The speech of the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the OxfordConservative Association was well reported, and was made the occasion for favour-able comment on Britaiihs progressive colonial policy. Plenty of interest isdemonstrated in the future of the Empire; views expressed in the United Statesthat,it will dissolve after the war have been sharply rebuked, with retorts to theeffect that it was largely the cohesion of the Empire in the darkest days whichheld the pass for the democratic nations.8. Mr. Churchilhs broadcast speech in March was very favourably received,a frequent comment being that it formed a more detailed interpretation of the atlantic Charter. Some newspapers found in it evidence that Mr. Churchillwould champion private enterprise as against bureaucracy, others stressed theevidence of the Prime Ministers resolve to seek the fullest co-operation with theAllied Powers after the war, especially with the United States, on the basic linesof the League of Nations.9. Mr. Eden&apos;s visit to the United States and Canada was welcomed, andtributes were paid to his qualities which, it was felt, would ensure success. its value in promoting Anglo-United States understanding was not overlooked, butthe prospect of discussion of post-war policies was chiefly canvassed.10.   The United States-Alaska Highway remains a source of considerableuneasiness, but comment on the subject is soft-pedalled.Naval, Military and Air Activities.11. H.M.C. Destroyer Athabaskan has been commissioned. She is thesecond Tribal class destroyer to be commissioned for the Royal Canadian Navy(the first being H.M.C.S. Iroquois) and was built at Xewcastle-on-Tyne.12.   H.M.C.S. Assiniboine probably sank a U-boat in mid-Atlantic on the night 2nd/3rd.13. The increase in activity of R.C.A.F. squadrons recorded in february was maintained during March and, with two more squadrons becomingoperational (Nos. 429 and 431), the R.C.A.F. largely shared in the general increaseof air activity of all commands. No. 405 squadron returned to duty withBomber Command from its temporary attachment to Coastal Command, so that,with the exception of No. 430 squadron, all Canadian squadrons are now taking part in operations.14. No. 403 Fighter squadron claimed five F.W. 190&apos;s destroyed, but them-selves lost three pilots. No. 408 Halifax squadron carried out 698 hours of operational flying. This squadron has been awarded three D.F.C.&apos;s and fourD.F.M.&apos;s. one of the latter being granted to a Flight. Sergeant of the Royal NewZealand Air Force. No. 419 Halifax squadron flew 700 operational hours onbombing and sea-mining.15.   From the month&apos;s operations four fighters and 23 bombers were reported .missing; No. 405 squadron suffered especially heavily losing a Flight Commander,a Deputy Flight Commander and two experienced crews all in one night.Economic and Financial.16. The negotiations are proceeding smoothly for the sale to the canadian government of the assets owned by the United Kingdom Government in munitionsfactories in Canada. It is understood, confidentially, that the Bills providingfor further financial assistance to the United Kingdom and other of the united nations will not be considered by the Canadian House of Commons before May.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.17. A political crisis, threatening the defeat of the Government, and ageneral election, developed in connexion with the discussion in the Senate of theNational Welfare Fund Bill, the object of which is to finance the NationalWelfare Scheme-Australia^ &quot; Beveridge Plan &quot; which will come into partial
operation shortly, and into full operation after the war. The Fund is to be financed out of the increased income-tax yield to be obtained largely by reducingthe level at which tax becomes payable; and the Prime Minister, hoping to sugarthe pill of tax payments for the numerous wage-earners who would be paying for the first time,&apos;and the lower income groups generally, introduced a clause in the Tax Bill making its operation contingent upon the passage into law of the welfare Fund Bill. The Senate resented this attempt to pre-judge the issue,and the defeat of the Government appeared likely, but the offending clause inthe Tax Bill was withdrawn, and the crisis passed. Later in the month, however,another deadlock supervened over the Governments proposals for preference inemployment for returned soldiers. Mr. Menzies has moved an amendment inthe House of Representatives, and the Senate demand priority of consideration for their amendment to the Repatriation Bill. An election in July is regardedas a possibility, but other reports have suggested the autumn as more probable.18. An interesting political development is foreshadowed by the formationin. Sydney of a company called &quot; Baro, Ltd.&quot;; this is ostensibly a kind ofemployers&apos; aid organisation, but its promoters are well-known members of theUnited Australia party, and its objectives are chiefly the combating of Fascism,Communism and Socialism, and the maintenance of democratic government with higher standards of political life. This objective may possibly cover theformation of an entirely new political group.19. Response to the  100,000,000 Victory Loan, launched on the16th March, has been very disappointing, partly, no doubt, owing to a relaxation of the feeling of danger&quot;and urgency following the Bismarck Sea victory, whichcreated immense enthusiasm and was hailed as decisive.20. The arrival home of the Ninth Division has been welcomed by the press,and many broadcast and other tributes to these veterans for their latest role inthe Middle East fighting were paid. The troops are reported to be unfavourablyimpressed with the attitude of the Australian civilian public to the war. Theyhave also been engaged in putting into proper perspective the military achieve-merits in Libya, &amp;c, of Allied troops other than those of the Anzacs, great though these latter have been.21. Concern has been expressed in speeches and the press over strikes,especially the coal strike.22. News of the arrival of Spitfire aircraft in the South Pacific zonecreated the liveliest satisfaction, and prompted much appreciative comment onBritain&apos;s aid to Australia and her war effort generally. Mr. L. W. Brockington&apos;visit, during which he gave a number of highly effective broadcast talks, has beena great success, and- is taken as evidence of Britain&apos;s awareness of the need for better publicity in. and liaison with, the Dominions.23. Mr. churchill&apos;s broadcast speech aroused the greatest interest, and was generally very well received. Mr. Church ills prestige throughout Australia isenormous, but Australians can hardly avoid regarding Japan as the chief enemy,and some critical comment was therefore inevitable (e.&apos;g., Daily Telegraph &quot; not as encouraging as it might have been for the peoples of the Pacific &quot;). There is,nevertheless, complete confidence in Britain&apos;s promise to concentrate its strengthagainst Japan once Germany is defeated. Mr. Churchilhs post-war plans, andthe evidence of how deeply he is concerned with post-war problems, were widelyapproved. &quot; Once again in a moment of danger a great leader of the British racehas spoken words of courage and wisdom.&quot; Mr. Curtin has said of the policyof &quot; beating Hitler first,&quot; that while it affords no comfort to Australia, &quot; we must play our part in total strategy, and fulfil the role assigned to us.&quot; Dr. Evatt,the Minister for External Affairs, said on the 29.th March, that the &quot; invasion of Australia or New- Zealand would be an unspeakable disgrace to all the united nations, after what the Dominions have done in this war.&quot;24. In foreign affairs the alleged design of the United States to retainpermanent control of air bases in the Southern Pacific zone for the purposes ofcivil aviation after the war, was given prominence. The Prime Ministers state-ment that the sovereignty of the bases has never been in question provedreassuring, and it is realised that the United States could not accept any responsibility for the maintenance of security in the Pacific without the &quot;use&quot;Qf bases.
25. Sir Keith Murdoch, former Director-General of Information, in a recent,article, advocated the granting of Australian citizenship to American soldierswho fought in the South-West Pacific area. While taking part in Empire affairs,Australia would need a United States alliance, and United States interest inthe South-West Pacific area must be retained.26. The Minister for External Affairs stated in a recent broadcast that australia must develop a foreign diplomatic service without delay. The closelink with Britain would always be preserved, but Australia had special responsibilities during the war, and wished to play a full part in building up an international order after it. Dr. Evatt is now in America en route for theUnited Kingdom.Naval, military and air activities.27. Two more minesweepers, H.M.A.S. Gladstone and H.M.A.S. Fremantle.were commissioned during the month.28. On the 1st March numbers of personnel borne on the strength of theRoyal Australian Navy were 29,045, composed of 8,300 active service and 20,745reserves.29. Fuel oil tanks, with a total capacity of 26,000 tons, have been completed at Woolloomoolloo, Sydney.30. Organizational Changes. Resulting from experience in New Guinea,and the. general need for saving man-power, certain important organizationalchanges have been effected.Infantry formations have now been divided into two classes (a) standardinfantry divisions, (b) jungle divisions. Except for minor changes, the standardinfantry divisions will remain as before. Three A.I.F. and two CommonwealthMilitary Forces infantry divisions will be reorganized as jungle infantry divisions. It is intended that this organization of infantry formations shall beso flexible that a regrouping of various sub-units may be made as the occasion arises. A considerable reduction in transport for units of jungle infantry divisions is anticipated, and the minimum of ancillary units is allotted to them,while a pool will be maintained for the allotment of corps troops for use with the divisions according to the requirements of particular operations. Resulting fromthis reorganization, there will be a regrouping of certain infantry brigades anddivisions.31. Lines of communication areas. With a view to reducing the overheadcommitments in lines of communication areas, particularly New South Wales andVictoria, First and Second Australian armies will take &quot;over, from Queensland.New South Wales and Victoria lines of communication areas respectively, allresponsibilities in connection with defence. This will result in a considerablesaving in man-power, and give unified control in defence, while retaining the operational freedom of the headquarters of both armies. The question of reducing the number of lines of communication sub-areas is also under considera-tion, with the object of effecting further economies in staffs and in man-power.32. Static coastal defences. In the static coastal defences a considerablesaving in man-power has been effected by the use of Volunteer Defence Corpspersonnel. Already a reduction of some 3,600 personnel of coast and anti-aircraft defences has been effected.Return of Australian Imperial Force from Middle East.33. Approximately 30,500 personnel of the 9th Australian Division and ancillary units have returned from Middle East, disembarking at Fremantle,Melbourne and Sydney.34. Maintenance of Northern Territory Force. Apart from sea transport,Northern Territory Force is maintained by railway and road communications viaAlice Springs and Birdum, controlled by the Australian military forces, and theroad route via Mount Isa and Tennanfs Creek, controlled by United States armyservices of supply. During the latter end of March the Australian military forcestook over control of the latter road.35. Australian panel bridge. Most successful tests have recently been com-pletecl of the Australian-designed panel bridge which is now in production&apos;Deliveries at the rate of one bridge of 152 ft. 6 in. span per month are expected.It was designed to provide a bridge of simple construction, wdiich could be rapid&apos;)&apos;
assembled in various ways, in order to meet varying requirements of span andloads. A bridge of low-load capacity can easily be strengthened to one of ahigher capacity without dismantling. It is capable of carrying a vehicle loadedto 70 tons, crossing singly.36. Shipping of vehicles. The position in regard to the shipping of vehicles and chassis to Australia has improved very considerably compared with theposition two months ago. At that time only 100 chassis were en route toAustralia, while 11,430 had been produced and were waiting to be shipped. Atpresent there are 3,725 vehicles and chassis en route, and approximately 8,800awaiting shipment,37. On the 31st March there were 150,823 of the United States forces inAustralia, of which 105,028 were ground troops.NEW ZEALAND.38. The statement by the United States Senator Maas, advocatingpermanent retention by the United States of Pacific air bases for the purposes ofcommercial aviation after the war, and alleging abuse of Lease-Lend by NewZealand over the construction of airfields, has been given prominence in the press,and has caused strong resentment. Such retention, it was felt, would imply thatBritish naval and air power would no longer extend to the South Pacific afterthe war, and this was a matter in which the whole Empire was concerned. TheNew Zealand Minister in Washington was immediately supplied with the New-Zealand answers to Senator Maas&apos;s allegations about the abuse of the Lease-Lend arrangements, and the completeness of the Prime Ministers refutation ofthe allegations made it clear that they were of an irresponsible character. TheChicago Tribune, which had published Senator Maas&apos;s statements, subsequentlytendered an apology which was noted with satisfaction in New Zealand.39. Mobilisation is still an issue. The Opposition maintain that it isexcessive, and they are supported by the press; the Government have been understrong pressure from some of their own supporters to demobilise the army in NewZealand entirely, except for reinforcements for the two Divisions overseas; andhave announced that a large number of men can be released for industry. Thedecision to allow men of 18 and 19 to return to civil life if they wish to do so hasbeen applauded. The Governments actions, e.g., the request for shipping tosend 2,000 men to the Middle East, presumably to allow others there to comehome on leave, are now regarded as being influenced by the prospects of the forth-coming election.40. There has been some call for the return of the New Zealand division from the Middle East as soon as the Tunisian campaign is over, though none forits immediate recall. The possibility that it will continue to be needed in europe is admitted in later references to this subject.41. The behaviour of more recent arrivals of American troops has not been quite so good as that of the first contingents.42. The press has been gratified by the announcement that almost the wholeof the New Zealand War Debt to Britain has been repaid.43. In Empire affairs, the appointment of Mr. Berendsen as New ZealandHigh Commissioner in Australia has been welcomed.44. The visit of Mr. Jones. Minister of Defence, to Washington, attractedattention, and it is regarded as connected with that of Mr. Evatt. Mr. Jonessubsequently visited the United Kingdom45. On the 10th March the Prime Minister made a speech in the House ofRepresentatives strongly condemning loose talk of the &quot;degeneracy&quot; of theBritish people. He praised their resolution in adversity, and their work as an imperial Power; British soldiers and statesmen in India now. he said, would bear comparison with those of any period in the past.46. There has been increased appreciation of Britain&apos;s war effort in thepress, and that the feats of the 8th Army in Tunisia.47. Mr. Churchill&apos;s recent broadcast was fully reported, and gave furtherimpetus to discussions of post-war problems, interest in which had already beenquickened by Mr. Morrison&apos;s Guildhall speech.    American suggestions that
Mr. Churchill&apos;s speech indicated an intention on Britain&apos;s part to withdraw fromthe war against Japan, once Germany was beaten, were quoted, only to be denounced.48. The future of Imperial Preference, in view of the fourth principle ofthe Atlantic Charter, and the prospects for the export of New Zealand primaryproduce, in view of the development of British agriculture, are matters of some concern and anxiety among business and agricultural interests.Naval. Military and A ir A cticities.49. In conjunction with the frontal attack launched by the 8th Armyagainst the Mareth defences on the night 20th/21st March, the New Zealand division was given the task of carrying out a wide outflanking movement throughthe desert directed via Ksar Rhilane upon El Hamma. By the evening of the23rd they had reached an area 10 miles south-west of El Hamma between the twofeatures known as the Djebel Tebaga and the Djebcl Melab, having taken about700 prisoners, and were in contact with, enemy armour.50. The New Zealand Division remained in contact with the enemy armoured force 10 miles south-west of El Hamma until on the afternoon of the-26th when the attack was resumed. After heavy fighting excellent progress hadbeen made by evening astride the El Hamma road and on the following day the1st Armoured Division passed through the New Zealand Division and reachedto within 2 miles of El Hamma, leaving the New Zealanders to mop up the high ground flanking the road. On the 28th the New Zealand Division, supportedby the 8th Armoured Brigade, were diverted from the attack on El Hamma and directed eastwards upon Gabes; by the end of the clay they were 15 miles south-west of the town having taken many prisoners and much enemy equipment.Next day the New Zealand Division occupied Gabes and pushed onwards to thenorth and north-west. On the 31st forward elements were already in touch withthe enemy in the Wadi Akarit position.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.51. In domestic affairs the general reaction to the Union Budget has been one of relief the country realises that it is not nearly so onerous as might havebeen expected, and that tax burdens in the Union are light compared with thoseof other Allied belligerents. The farmers and the mining companies and share-holders have special reason to congratulate themselves on the comparativelightness of their burdens. The Opposition press naturally objects to any expenditure on the war, and complains of the impoverishment of the country bymounting expenditure, for which the ordinary man must pay while the rich arelet off lightly.52. On the 12th March General Smuts announced that there would be aGeneral Election later in the year, and preparations have since been in fullswing. The Government will fight the election on the war issue, and favourablewar news will obviously have a bearing on the result. The Opposition parties are trying hard to form a united front, based on an anti-Communist platform,but the discordant elements among them, e.g., the extreme Transvaalers under mr. Strydom, and pro-Nazi &quot; Ossewa Brandwag &quot; make such a front doubtful.On the other hand, agreement between the United Party and the LabourParty seems likely to be reached.53. The policy of &quot;segregation&quot; for natives, which retards the develop-ment of secondaiy industries, is reported to be growing into an important issue which may embarrass the Government.54. There has been some dissatisfaction with the pay and allowances of thearmy, especially in the 1st Division, now in South Africa, and this has beenfanned by the Communist-controlled Springbok Legion; and, from the opposite direction, by the Nationalist Part)&apos;, which has, for once, been making a show of concern for soldiers&apos; interests. The report of a select committee, set up to examinethe complaints, recommends large increases in the pay of European and coloured troops, but only negligible ones for natives. This is widely regarded as anunworthy vote-catching manoeuvre.55. The infiltration of Indians into European areas, mainly in Durban, isfast becoming a major political issue.   Indians have been making large profits
in the past year or two, and have invested extensively in real estate, and publicopinion in Natal has become inflamed over this penetration. The Governmenthave introduced legislation &quot; pegging&quot; the position as at the 22nd March. TheDominion Party who are leading the agitation in the House of Assembly, havebeen accused by a Labour member of damaging the Empire and annoying india for the sake of electoral expediency.56. Colonel Stanley&apos;s speech on the Colonies was reported by newspapers ofboth sides, and approved or disapproved according to party. A typicalpro-Government newspaper comment was that Britain, with her experience and her policy, could rightly claim to be the proper1 power to control and guide hercolonies. The Burgher said that the speech &quot;warned the United States off,&quot;and that the British Government resented the application of the Atlantic charter to her colonies.57. Mr. Churchilks recent broadcast speech was heard by a great many people, and was fully reported by papers of both sides. The Cape Times regarded the speech as a political document of the first importance; the Cape Argus saidthat the postponement of the Beveridge plans would disappoint many, but therewas no doubt about Mr. Churchilks own eagerness for reform; the Rand daily mail considered the speech as astonishing, coming as it did from &quot; a Conservativestatesman leading a party more conservative than himself.&quot;58. Mr. Eden&apos;s visit to the United States and Canada aroused general interest and comment, which mainly centred round the discussion of post-warinternational problems. In this connexion the Foreign Secretary was said byone newspaper to &quot; understand and be trusted by Russia, and to be one of those most capable also of winning the confidence of America.&quot; The mission was regarded as an attempt to forestall the clanger of a repetition of the inter-xAllieddifficulties which followed the war of 1914-18.59. The Russian successes of the past few months, although warmly welcomed by the pro-Government press, have stirred up a &quot;black revolution&quot;&apos;scare in the Nationalist press. A motion in the House of Assembly against theli Communist menace &quot; was defeated in a vote strictly on party lines, but theGovernment defence was unimpressive, and it was clear that some Right-wingGovernment supporters are worried by the prospect of Russian domination ofEurope.60. Relations with Russia have, in fact, absorbed most of the press comment on international affairs. Admiral Standley&apos;s forthright statement causedsomething of a sensation, and. although the subsequent statement made in washington put the matter in its proper perspective, there was some doubt whether the speech of the United States Vice-President. Mi&apos;. Wallace, was aswise,as it was courageous. The dangerous possibilities of inter-Allied disunitywere frankly discussed, and it was generally recognised that anything whichmight tend &quot;to draw the Allies apart would be a victory for the Nazis. TheOpposition press always makes the most of any evidence of friction between theAllies, and continues to harp on the tidal wave of communism which will sweepover Europe if Germany were to be defeated.61. Speaking at Johannesburg on the 19th March on the occasion of theconferring on Mrs. Smuts of the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws ofWitwatersrand University, General Smuts said that the tide had turned for good,and that victory was coming nearer. &quot; The historic human advance will not behalted : the great light will not be put out.&quot;Naval, Military and. Air Activities.62. The general policy with regard to the use of man-power is now to givefirst priority to those destined for service outside the Union, coupled with the anti-submarine organisation in the Union, both air and seaward, and secondpriority to the forces in the Union.63. Owing to the improvement in the general situation in North africa and the introduction of a new7 oath for general service, recruiting for Africanservice has ceased and volunteers, for general service only are now accepted. Thequestion of the efficient disposal of personnel from existing forces who do notvolunteer for general service is now under consideration.64. The general programme and aim is briefly one General ServiceArmoured  Division  plus  two independent  General &quot;Service  Armoured   Car
Regiments plus two General Service Field Engineer Companies plus one general service Engineer Field Park Company, all for service in general war theatresplus the following for duty in Southern Africa : One Armoured Brigade Group,one Southern Rhodesian African Rifles Motorised Brigade, ancillary troops on adivisional scale, three Motorised Battalions for duty Durban, Capetown andSouth-West Africa. Certain Headquarter units, e.g., one heavy A.A., oneSearchlight Regiment, two medium regiments, &amp;c, plus one fully organised part-time armoured car division with adequate reserves. In other words, the wartheatre programme has roughly been reduced from two to one division and theSouthern Africa programme from a mobile field force of two armoured brigadegroups to one of one armoured brigade group plus a Rhodesian African motorisedbrigade and from a part-time organisation of two armoured car divisions to one.Economic and Financial.65. The budget for the financial year 1943-44 was introduced byMr. Hofmeyr on the 24th February. Total expenditure is estimated at 164 million, which is a little above that for 1942-43; the provision for defence is  96 millions, which is the same as the amount spent on defence last year.About one-third of the total expenditure is to be met by borrowing and the restout of revenue.66. Following an announcement made by the Newfoundland Governmentearly in March that it wras proposed to make certain increases in the rates of income tax and excess profits tax payable on the income and profits of the calendar year 1942, an agitation against the proposals was worked up in the local press onthe grounds that an increase in taxation with retrospective effect wasunprecedented and that the Newfoundland Government did not require the extrarevenue as a considerable surplus was expected for the financial year ending onthe 31st March. The Newfoundland Board of Trade subsequently passed aresolution protesting against the taxation and proposing the formation of aCommittee to consider the establishment of a satisfactory form of representative government as a preliminary to the restoration of responsible Government. TheCommission of Government have maintained their proposals, the justification forwhich has been explained in speeches by two of the Commissioners, and the Boardof Trade have been informed that the Secretary of State is satisfied that themeasures announced by the Commission, in which he fully concurs, are in thebest interests of the Island.67. The Governor subsequently received a resolution by the Board of Trade,which he is forwrarding &quot;by mail, petitioning His Majesty to appoint a RoyalCommission to determine the popular will with respect to the form that self-government should take.EIRE.68. In public speeches Mr. Lemass continues to refer to the subject of the ports. Speaking at Galway on the 7th March he alleged that the opposition parties had strenuously opposed the enactment of the Constitution and the taking over of the ports, the last critical steps which had made neutrality possible.Mr. Lemass asked whether the people of Eire were now to put their trust in menwho had been so astoundingly wrong on every vital question of national policyduring the past decade.69. The Minister for Agriculture. Dr. Ryan, speaking at a Fianna Failmeeting at Enniscorthy at about the same time, said that neutrality had thesupport of all parties and members of all parties took part in the emergencyorganisations. However, that it was possible to remain neutral was clue toMr. de Valera&apos;s foresight in securing the return of the ports. Yet at the time there had been a great deal of criticism at the taking back of the ports and theGovernment had been accused of &quot; keeping them warm for the British Navy.&quot;70. Mr. E. F. Benson (Fine Gael) asked Mr. de Valera in the Dail on the18th March if his attention had been called to a statement by the Leader of theBritish House of Lords that the British Government had already been in touchwith the Dominions and India on post-war financial questions; whether.ireland had been included in such discussions and, if not, if he would make representations to have Ireland included. In reply, Mr. de Valera said that Eire had. not been included in the discussions.  He added : &quot; There was a certain informal exchange
of information on financial matters going on all the time between the two countries.If at any time formal discussions were considered necessary, representations tothat effect will be made.&quot; Nevertheless, there are signs of increasing anxiety in eire Government circles at the possibility that Eire may be excluded from allpost-war discussions.71. In his St. Patrick&apos;s Day broadcast, on the 17th March, Mr. de Valerasaid that the country&apos;s greatest uncompleted national tasks were the restorationof the unity of the national territory and the restoration of the language. &quot; the physical dangers that threaten and the need for unceasing vigilance in the mattersof defence as well as unremitting attention to the day to day problems that thewar has brought upon us should not cause us to neglect our duty to the language.The task of restoring a language as the everyday speech of our people is a taskas great as any country ever undertook.&quot;72. In February the external trade of Eire reached an unprecedentedly low level The total amount of  3,991.146 was made up of imports  2,004.082 and exports  1,987,064.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.73. Optimism as to the war received some setback from the fluctuations ofthe fighting in Russia, and particular disappointment was felt over the failure to achieve results in the Arakan district of Burma.74. Politics were again in the doldrums. Mr. Gandhi brought his &quot; fast to capacity &quot; to its appointed end on the 3rd March, and the public excitement whichit had at first engendered faded away. The Government of India were thusspared the embarrassment which his death during the fast would have caused,and impressively demonstrated their firmness in resisting this form of political&apos;blackmail. The non-party leaders, who had appealed to the Viceroy to releaseMr. Gandhi during the fast, continued their attempts to find a solution of thepolitical deadlock, and made a fresh approach to the Viceroy in the hope ofobtaining permission to discuss the situation with Mr. Gandhi, wdiose release they said would allow him to contribute to a solution and would not endanger thesuccessful prosecution of the war. The Viceroy, in refusing the request, pointedout that neither Mr. Gandhi nor the Congress leaders had shown any inclinationto condemn the activities of those who engaged in the disturbances of last autumn, nor had they dissociated themselves from the resolution of last Augustwhich led to those evils.75. A political crisis occurred in Bengal at the end of the month owing tothe announcement by the Premier, Fazl-ul-ITuq, of his resignation two days beforethe final date, under the Government of India Act, for passing the budget for thecoming year. The Premier had been in office for several years, but the positionand that of his Ministry had recently become increasingly insecure. It wasimpossible to form an alternative Ministry immediately, and, in order to providea lawful basis for expenditure after&apos; the 31st March until a new7 Ministry could take over, the Governor had no option but to take the administration into hisown hands by a Proclamation under Section 93 of the Government of India Actand to authenticate the budget demands for the coming year,76. The country generally remained peaceful, though subversive activitieson a minor scale persisted in parts of Bengal and Bombay. The campaign againstthe Flurs in Sind continued. Their leader, the Pir Pagaro, was executed duringthe month after being tried and sentenced by a court martial on a charge ofwaging or conspiring to wage war against His Majesty. It is hoped that his death will contribute to an early pacification of the district and to the removalof martial law7.Indian States.77. The termination of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s fast occasioned widespread relief, but even at the most critical stage it failed to resuscitate any large-scale agitation.Some cases of arson and sabotage are reported from States in Southern Bombay,and looting of grain shops is reported from Hyderabad. The position generallyis, however, satisfactory.
External and Frontier Relations.78. A fahanistau. His Majesty&apos;s Minister had a long and friendly interview with the Prime Minister, who, in the course of the discussion, expressed himself as anxious to avail himself of British assistance, particularly in the way of theloan of education, health and other experts. It remains to be seen whether anything further will come of this talk, but it is, at any rate, a noticeable changein the attitude hitherto adopted by the Afghan Government during the war.Sir Francis Wylie reported that the Prime Minister appears now to have made up his mind that the Allied Nations are going to win the war and that the sameimpression seemed to be spreading among the general public. He ascribed thisswing-over of opinion to events in Russia, combined with the Allied landings in north Africa and the heavy air offensive on Germany.79. Mr. gandhis fast attracted little attention in Afghanistan. Theeconomic situation presented no special features. The winter had been mild andthere was less distress in towns than was the case last year. The price of wheathad risen about 60 per cent., but there wras no local scarcity.80. North-West Frontier. Waziristan remained quiet, but there was sometrouble in the Khyber wdiere a large lashkar congregated to support the ZakhaKhel Afridis in refusing to permit work on the Khyber defence scheme. economic sanctions were applied and the lash/car eventually dispersed after taking oathsas a face-saving device from the Zakha Khel elders not to permit constructionnear villages. In the settled districts there was a serious raid on a village in theBannu District. The gang made good its escape after killing seven villagers andwounding three more.   Five villagers also were kidnapped.81. Tibet. An indication that there has been no change in the Chineseattitude towards Tibet was given in an interview which Mr. Eden had withMr. Soons; in Washington, during which Mr. Soon&quot;- remarked that the Chinesehad always regarded Tibet as part of the Republic, and said that he had not beenwholly reassured as to the Government of India&apos;s attitude during his visit toIndia. He complained that when the Chinese had expressed a desire to openroutes through Tibet the Government of India had appeared to be unwilling toco-operate. In fact, of course, we have used our good offices with the Tibetans inorder to get a pack route through Tibet started, but the Tibetans have insisted on a British guarantee of any contracts made by them with the Chinese Govern-ment, while the Chinese are unwilling to accept our mediation to this extent.Matters therefore remain at a deadlockThe Tibetan Government, as also the Maharajas of Bhutan and. Sikkim, have asked that Sir Basil Gould, the Political Officer in Sikkim who was due to retire,should have his appointment extended. Since it was clear that Sir Basil Gouldhad won the confidence of all three Governments to a remarkable degree, he hasbeen given a year&apos;s extension.82. China. The Government of India discussed the organisation of theLeh-Karakeram route with the Chinese Commissioner, and suggested that Lehshould be the exchange point and that the organisation of transport from rail-head at Rawalpindi should be handled through some such agency as the PekingSyndicate, in whom both Governments had confidence. The Chinese Commissioneris now consulting his Government.83. The United States of America. Mr. Phillips, the Presidents personal representative in India, stated that his Government wished to post two foreign service Officers to his staff as counsellors, one of whom would be commercial counsellor. He also enquired whether there would be any objection to designatinghis secretaries as First, Second and Third Secretaries. He is being informedthat we have no objection to the posting of the extra staff mentioned, though wecannot agree to diplomatic ranking being given to his staff since this would be inconsistent with India&apos;s constitutional position. There were some disturbingindications that Mr. Phillips was contemplating some form of intervention in theIndian situation and was likely to renew his request to be allowed to see Mr. Gandhi. The desirability of making it plain in high quarters in Washingtonthat any activities of this kind by Mr. Phillips would be embarrassing, was broughtto notice in connection with Mr. Eden&apos;s recent visit, but it is not yet known whether any action was found possible.84. The Persian Gulf. In view of the deep alarm shown in the persian gulf Sheikhdoms lest the despatches of food from the Middle East Supply Centre
should not arrive before local stocks were exhausted, the Government of Indiadecided, in spite of their serious domestic difficulties, to sanction the immediateexport of 6,000 tons of wheat to the Persian Gulf.Finance.85.   Nothing to report.Economic.86. Food Situation. Weekly reports from the Government of India on thefood situation are now coming in regularly and so far have indicated that theposition shows general improvement. Wheat is coming forward for purchasewith greater readiness, and though the price is very high it has come down fromits peak. The prospects of the approaching spring crops wheat, grain and barley, are excellent.87. Less happy is the rice position. The harvest just completed was a saddisappointment, and this means that the outlook for the later months of this year&apos;s  an anxious one. Rice prices in Bengal are alarmingly high, but efforts are beingmade to meet the situation by imports from surrounding provinces.88. A recent conference between the Central Government and the provinces and States settled a number of points and worked out plans for the purchase by government of the greatest possible volume of grains as a means of securingequilibrium of supply and prices throughout the country. The Food Departmentof the Government of India are rstill considering,&apos; in consultation with theProvinces and States, the surplus and deficit figures for each of them on whichthis twelve months&apos; plan will be based.89. Steps are being taken preparatory to the introduction of rationing, ifnecessary, in main urban centres, and it is hoped shortly to despatch to India anofficer with experience in this country and elsewhere to advise the Indianauthorities in this connection. Other, measures recently taken or under active consideration are reduction by order of the bran percentage extracted fromwheat, prohibition of the polishing of rice, closer control of speculative opera-tions, improvement of statistics, a food production drive and propaganda againsthoarding and for economy.90. India report that, despite the local set-back in Bengal, public confidenceis improving, due principally to the improved war situation, arrivals of australian wheat and good harvest prospects. They see no reason why this improvementshould not be maintained.Naval, Military and A ir Force A activities.91. Military. Field-Marshal Wavell visited the Arakan Front during themonth. The Arakan operations have continued. There has been little change onthe Donbaik front, where our attacks did not succeed in overcoming the Japanesedefences. East of the Mayu River enemy infiltration tactics caused us to makeslight withdrawals to stabilise our front.92. Our lines of communication in this area are long and difficult. Thoseof the enemy are short and their control of the mouths of the Kaladan, Kywedeand Mayu rivers has enabled them to infiltrate up these rivers and theirsubsidiary creeks and threaten to outflank our eastern detachments. Our navalsupport has never been strong enough to block completely the approaches to theserivers, nor has the Air Force been able to prevent their use, although both navy and Air Forces have inflicted considerable casualties.93. In the Chin Hills and Hukawaung Valley normal patrol activity hascontinued. The enemy have shown no aggressive intentions. The small Japaneseforce referred to last month as having advanced from Myitkyina is still in theneighbourhood of Sumprabum, and is being harassed by our levies.94. Japanese aircraft losses from A.A. fire during February were :Destroyed, 5.   Probably destroyed, 2.   Damaged, 17.95. It has been decided to increase the number of officers in all IndianInfantry Battalions from 14 to 17. This will enable all rifle companies to becommanded by a British or Indian Commissioned Officer in battle.
BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.107. Occupied Burma. Ba Maw, together with other members of thepuppet administration, are now in Tokyo, where much is being made of them.Ba Maw having received the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun.General Tojo has made another speech in the House of Peers reaffirming hispromise of the 28th January to grant Burma independence within the year, andthe purpose of the visit is said to be to arrange details.108. According to our latest information, the Japanese are administeringBurma on the lines of a totalitarian State. In each district, parallel with a deputy Commissioner, there is a member of the Dobama Sinyetha (the solerecognised political party), who appears to have wider powers and whose task ispresumably to see that Ba Maw&apos;s political policy is carried out. The JapaneseMilitary Commander is reserving to himself powers to revise decisions of the burmese High Court.109. Certain reports have been received bearing on possible Burmesereactions to our bombing policy. One report states that the Japanese, prior totheir occupation of Burma, gained a reputation for accurate bombing, and tends to impute the contrary to the Allied Air Forces.   For what it is worth, a96. Air. Enemy activity in the air has increased. Attacks have been madeon airfields as well as on forward troops. Damage on the whole has been slightwhile enemy casualties have been heavy. Two formations of 25 escorted bombersattacking Cox&apos;s Bazaar and shipping in the Naaf River were intercepted by ourHurricanes. Enemy casualties were : Destroyed, 12. Probably destroyed, 3.Damaged. 9. In an attack on Maungdaw. in which an ammunition dump was hit, 10 enemy aircraft were destroyed or damaged. 27 escorted heavy bombers attacked Penny airfield in Bengal causing some damage. Hurricanes destroyed5 bombers, probably- destroyed 5 more and damaged at least 3.97. R.A.F. fighters and light bombers have operated continuously throughoutthe month, mainly in support of the army in Arakan. The light bombers, inaddition, have successfully raided Taungup, Monywa, a camp at Prome and other points on enemy lines of communication. Night bombing of enemy airfields hasbeen continued. The U.S.A.A.F. has operated against railway communications and troops and other targets in Upper Burma.98. General. The internal situation remains quiet. There has been littlereaction to the execution of the Pir Pagaro, the Hur leader.99. Battle dress of an olive-green colour has been produced for wear in operations in jungle country and will shortly be taken into use.100. Arrangements are being made for the exchange of information aboutjungle warfare tactics, organisation and equipment with Australia and theUnited States.101. The recent cut in shipping has had an adverse effect on the progress ofaerodrome and other construction, which is. in consequence, considerably behindschedule.102. The total number of Chinese troops which has arrived by air fortraining is now 24.662.103. 63.000 recruits were enrolled for the army in February. . Recruitingfor the Indian Air Force continues to improve.104. The Carrier System of communication is now in operation betweenBombay and Bangalore, and will shortly be working between Bombay and Delhi.105. In regard to post-war reconstruction, the possibility of employingIndian Hospital Corps personnel on demobilisation in Provincial Health Corpsis being examined.106. In order to assist soldiers after the war to adjust themselves to civil life the Government of India, besides crediting them with deferred pay, isdepositing amounts equivalent to the deferred pay in a reconstruction fund forwelfare schemes.
Japanese radio claim alleged that a bomb fell on the Shwedagon Pagoda inRangoon. Allegations have also been made of machine-gunning of sampans(native craft) outside operational areas.110. Frontier Administration. Following the spirited action of theKachin Levies (who are credited with having killed at least 500 Japanese) inthe north of the Myitkyina district, there was a considerable Japanese advance inthis area. Our civil officers with one exception were evacuated by air on the7th March.111. Plans have been made to provide personnel.for eventual service in thearmy to deal with civil affairs during the military period of reoccupationMeanwhile, as regards the frontier areas, it has been agreed that theCommander-m-Chief, India, should be the de facto executive authority, and officers now engaged in frontier administration are being commissioned as civil affairs officers in the Army.112. British Propaganda-Preparations are now complete for the dropping of a newspaper from the air from the beginning of April.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.113. Ceylon.-^The supply of cereals to Ceylon continues to require close attention. Owing to delay in deliveries by rice millers in Egypt, it is unlikelythat the first consignments of rice from that country will reach Ceylon beforethe latter part of April. There have also been delays in the shipment of ricefrom India, although arrivals in Ceylon from India during April are expectedto show an improvement compared with the previous month. To relieve this situation the Minister of War Transport has asked the Secretary of State forIndia to seek the concurrence of the Government of India in the diversion to ceylon of two full cargoes of wheat now afloat on their way to. India, and to the diversion from the United Kingdom programme of two flour ships due to load inAustralia in the latter part of April. The question whether the cargoes of boththe latter ships will be taken by Ceylon is to be decided in the light of thesituation in Ceylon when the ships reach Colombo.114. It is very desirable to build up a bigger reserve stock of cereals in ceylon at an early date, but in the present shipping situation this has provedfor the time being impossible. The difficulties of programming Ceylon&apos;s require-ments are much increased by the uncertainty of supplies of rice from both egypt and India.115. East Africa. The position in East Africa has now been relieved bythe arrival during March of a cargo of maize and wheat from the Argentine ina Swedish ship chartered for the purpose, and by the diversion to East Africaof two cargoes of wheat from Australia. In addition. 5,000 tons of maize arebeing shipped to East Africa from Angola about the middle of April.116. Negotiations for a second charter of the Swedish ship to carry afurther cargo of Argentine maize are now in progress. The latest reports from east Africa show that, while further prospects must remain uncertain for some weeks until the forthcoming rains, the immediate shortage has been overcome.117. Mauritius. The prospect of an acute shortage suddenly arose in this island owing to the delay in the departure of a steamer from Australia on accountof engine trouble. The shortage has now been relieved by the unloading atMauritius of 3,000 tons of wheat from one of the steamers originally destined for East Africa. A further steamer carrying 6,000 tons of flour is due in the island towards the end of the month, and this should provide stocks sufficient to last into June, by which time the local harvests should be available.
118. Seychelles. A shortage was also threatened in this small group ofIslands, but has been met by the transfer of small quantities of flour fromMauritius and of maize from Mombasa. A further 1,000 tons of flour is heincrsent to the Seychelles by transhipment at Mauritius, and this should coverrequirements for the next four or five months.Defence.British Solomon Islands Protectorate.119. Reference paragraph 115 of the Report for December, the following further account of the organisation and work of the native Labour Corps andnative Service Battalion has been received from the Acting High Commissionerfor the Western Pacific.Telegram       (a)  Labour Corps.No. /1 from    x  &apos; rw. Pacific. Recruiting was started on  the 3rd  December and  continued until the29th of January, when a total of 1.450 had been enlisted. Of these 1.100 werein Guadalcanal and 350 in Tulagi. The Force is officered by 15 Europeans andis organised by Companies of 300 each, divided into sections of 25. It is employedin discharging cargo, in field construction, road maintenance and construction,and in carrying rations and ammunition to the forward lines. The morale of theForce suffered as a result of enemy bombing raids, in particular by a raid onLunga Camp (Guadalcanal) on the 26th January when eleven natives were killed and nine injured. Most of the natives walked out and for some days refused towork but they were eventually persuaded to return and have worked well since.Apart from this, the Force has been satisfactory and requests have been received for increased numbers. There has, however, been no recruiting since the end ofJanuary; it will be resumed when the effects&quot;of the bombing have become lessprominent in the minds of the population.Telegram    (b) Service Battalion.No. 75 from. Pacific. Present strength 5 Officers (2 New Zealanders).6 European N.C.Os. (New Zealanders).22 Fijians.242 Solomon Islanders.This Force has been built up from a nucleus of Guadalcanal natives who didvaluable work in locating enemy positions in the early stage of operations there.Sixty experienced native scouts were sent to Malaita, where recruiting was under-taken, and training was begun there in mid-January. After three weeks intensivepreliminary work, the Unit was transferred to Guadalcanal for further trainingin the field. Four patrols were carried out in the battle area immediately beforethe Japanese evacuation of Guadalcanal. These did good work in locating enemy positions and mopping up, taking some prisoners. Another patrol was sent tothe Russell Islands, following which the United States Forces occupied that area.. Although on the whole good work has been done, the Malaita men in particularhave been somewhat disappointing and less reliable in the bush than had been hoped. This is attributed mainly to short training, but training is now being continued and the men are serving a useful purpose as security patrols on Guadal-canal. Members of the Force wear dark green uniform which is most suitablefor bush work.120. Reference paragraph 109 of the Report for February, no further cases have been reported to the punitive bombing of native villages by the United StatesService authorities.Reports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.121. The movement towards the formation of an Arab political bodyreferred to in the last report has made little or no progress. Talk amongpoliticians continues, but unity of opinion still seems remote.122. Political activity in the Jewish community was mainly focussed onfiscal and economic matters. Opposition on the Jewish side to the proposed newtaxation centres on the income tax and surtax, but the Jews have also asked that
1 23A W vthe enactment of the Estate Duty Bill be deferred. On the Arab side the newtaxation has aroused considerable outcry and the landlords and townsmen havevoiced uncompromising opposition to the Estate Duty Bill.123.   Crop prospects remain uncertain because continuous rains are nowgiving cause for anxiety as regards summer crops.124. The uncertain supply situation referred to in the last report hassomewhat improved. With the assistance of the Middle East Supply Centreimports have increased, whilst supplies from Trans-Jordan have been coming forward more regularly. Prices in relation to the cost of living is still the dangerspot. A serious threat of widespread strikes early in the month has been temporarily averted, though labour still remains restive.125.   Both Arab and Jewish recruiting remained at a low level.Ceylon.126. There has been further correspondence between the Governments ofIndia and Ceylon regarding the provision of additional labour for Ceylon rubberestates.127. On the 7th March the Government of India, after noting with regret that the Government of Ceylon felt unable to consider their suggestions for the prior conclusion of an agreement covering the general question of the status of indians in Ceylon, stated their readiness to permit the return to Ceylon of amaximum of 20,000 labourers now in India who had worked in Ceylon before, ifthe Ceylon Government would agree not to attach any condition of compulsoryrepatriation to their return to Ceylon, all questions affecting their status thereto be left for determination as part of the general negotiations to take place afterthe war on the status of Indians in Ceylon.The Ceylon Government had previously pointed out that in 1941 a provisional agreement for the settlement of the problem of the status of Indian immigrantsin Ceylon had been negotiated between representatives of the two Governments,and Ceylon was still ready to implement that agreement. The Government ofIndia&apos;s new proposal for fresh negotiations would set aside that agreement.128. On the 30th March the Governor of Ceylon replied to the Government governors of India that, as the State Council had accepted a joint report by the Executive No6597mCommittees concerned to the effect that the maximum output could be obtainedwith the labour locally available, it would be necessary for a reply to the Govern-ment of India&apos;s offer to be postponed until the position could be reviewed in thelight of the results obtained from the implementation of the recommendations forthe provision of local labour.West Indies.129.   Sir Cosmo Parkinson, my personal representative, has just returnedhome from a tour in which he visited each one of the West Indian Colonies.Bahamas.130. A copy of the report on the Commission to enquire into the disturb-ances in the Bahamas was laid in the Library of the House of Commons, togetherwith a statement on the subject based on a despatch received from the Governor.Bermuda.131.   Lord Knollys, the Governor of Bermuda, has arrived in this&apos;countryfor consultation.West A frica.132. At the end of February the United States Chiefs of Staff informed theBritish Admiralty Delegation in Washington that they had decided to withdraw/from further participation in the development of the port of Freetown. Althoughthe British Admiralty Delegation, on the instructions of the Admiralty, resistedthe United States proposals, they were not able to induce the Americans to change their minds and the American decision is being accepted as final. The UnitedStates construction party now in Freetown will stay there until the 1st May, so asto allow time for their work to be taken over by British personnel. The americans are also being pressed to leave behind as much equipment as possible.
