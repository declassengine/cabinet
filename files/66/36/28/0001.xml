Printed for the War Cabinet.  April 19.43.secret.P. (43) 178.April 28, 1943.Copy No.   O ^WAR CABINET.PALESTINE.Note by the Prime Minister.I am sorry to inflict upon my colleagues the enclosed reprint of the speechI made in the House in May 1939, which has recently been reprinted as anadvertisement by the Zionist Organization of America in connection with therefugee problem.While I could not advise the Cabinet to make any new declaration at thepresent time, I must make it clear that I personally remain an unchangingsupporter of the Balfour Declaration modified as it was by the Colonial OfficeWhite Paper which I drafted in 1922, and I cannot in any circumstancescontemplate an absolute cessation of immigration into Palestine at the discretion of the Arab majority.I do not feel that the fact that we make no new declaration now in any waycompromises or commits those who have opposed the White Paper of 1939. Facedwith the emergencies of war, we have left the question where it stood. We are free, as a new Government, to review the entire field at the end of the war.I should expect that American pressure for a new declaration would be very strong, and I believe President Roosevelt to be in entire agreement with me onthe subject.A careful examination should be made by the Departments concerned of thepossibilities of making Eritrea and Tripolitania into Jewish colonies, affiliated,if desired, to the National Home in Palestine. Such a new departure wouldbroaden the whole issue, and perhaps make general agreement possible, betweenthe disputants, both at home and on the spot. Cyrenaica, in which the Senussi.followers are so strong, might well be another predominantly Arab domain.
We have certainly treated the Arabs very well, having installed King Feisaland his descendants upon the Throne of Iraq and maintained them there; havingmaintained the Emir Abdullah in Transjordania and having asserted the rightsof self-government for the Arabs and other inhabitants of Syria. With theexception of Ibn Saud and the Emir Abdullah, both of whom have been good andfaithful followers, the Arabs have been virtually of no use to us in the present war. They have taken no part in the fighting, except in so far as they were involved in the Iraq rebellion against us. They have created no new claims uponthe Allies, should we be victorious.w. s. c.10 downing  Street, S.W. 1,A pril 27, 1943.
Speech by Mr. Churchill, in the House of Commons,May 23, 1939.I find this a melancholy occasion. Like my right hon. Friend the member for Sparkbrook (Mr. Amery), I feel bound to vote against the proposals ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government. As one intimately and responsibly concerned inthe earlier stages, of our Palestine policy, I could not stand by and see solemnengagements into which Britain has entered before the world set aside for reasons of administrative convenience or and it will be a vain hope for the sake of aquiet life. Like my right hon. Friend, I should feel personally embarrassed inthe most acute manner if I lent myself, by silence or inaction, to what I mustregard as an act of repudiation. I can understand that others take a differentview. There are many views which may be taken. Some may consider themselvesless involved in the declarations of former Governments. Some may feel thatthe burden of keeping faith weighs upon them rather oppressively. Some may bepro-Arab and some may be anti-Semite. None of these motives offers me any means of escape because I was&apos; from the beginning a sincere advocate of the balfour Declaration, and I have made repeated public statements to that effect.It is often supposed that the Balfour Declaration was an ill-considered,sentimental act largely concerned with the right hon. Member for CarnarvonBoroughs (Mr. Lloyd George), for which the Conservative party had no realresponsibility, and that, as the Secretary of State said yesterday, it was a thing-done in the tumult of the war. But hardly any step was taken with greaterdeliberation and responsibility. I was glad to hear the account which my right on. Friend the Member for Sparkbrook gave, derived from the days when he was working in the Secretariat of the War Cabinet, of the care and pains with whichthe whole field was explored at that time. Not only did the War Cabinet of thosedays take the decision, but all Cabinets of every party after the war, after examining it in the varying circumstances which have arisen, have endorsed thedecision and taken the fullest responsibility for it. It was also endorsed inthe most cordial and enthusiastic terms by many of the ablest ConservativePrivate Members who came into the House when a great Conservative majorityarrived after the General Election at the end of 1918. It was endorsed from thevery beginning by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.I make him my apologies for going back as far as 20 years, but when youare dealing with matters which affect the history of two or three thousand years,there is no reason why the continuity of opinion should not be displayed. Myright hon. Friend, on the 13th October, 1918, said : &quot; The sympathy of the British Government with Zionist aspirationsdoes not date from yesterday .... My father was anxious to find such a territory within the limits of the British Constitution .... To-day theopportunity has come. I have no hesitation in saying that were my fatheralive to-day he would be among the first to welcome it and to give it hishearty support.&quot;Then other members of the Government, most distinguished members, who were then Private Members in the House a brilliant crop, if 1 may say so, in theiryoung first fresh flight made a strong effort. The Dominions Secretary, quite a slim figure on the benches up here was heavily engaged. There were also theMinister of Health, the Home Secretary and, above all, the Prime Minister; andthis is the memorial they sent us. I abridge it, but not in such a way as to alterits sense.. I may in abridging it diminish its force, but its force is evident fromthe extract: &quot; We, the undersigned, having cordially welcomed the historic Declara-tion made on the 2nd November, 1917, by His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; that is, the Balfour Declaration r&apos;&apos; that it would use its best endeavours to facilitate the establishment of a jewish National Home in Palestine .... now respectfully and solemnlyurge upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the necessity of redeeming this pledgeby the acceptance of a Mandate under the League of Nations.&quot;Here was this statement which was made and which was put forward, and while say I do not compare the responsibility of private Members with that exercised[25356a] b
by Ministers of the Grown or by the head of the Government, nevertheless I think,when all is said and done, that Zionists have a right to look to the Prime Ministerto stand by them in the days of his power. They had a special right to look tohim because he was not only giving effect to his own deep convictions, but wascarrying forward the large conceptions of his father whose memory he reveresand whose renown he has revived. I was not a member of the War Cabinet inthe days when this pledge was given. I was serving under it as a highfunctionary. That was the position of the Secretaries of State. I found myselfin entire agreement with those sentiments so well expressed by the Prime Ministerand his friends when thev were sending in their memorial.When I went to the Colonial Office it was in this spirit that I wrote this despatch, under the authority of the Cabinet, which is quoted so much in theWhite Paper now before jtvs Great use is made of this despatch of 1922 in theWhite Paper. It is sought to found the argument of the White Paper largely upon it. I stand by every word in those lengthy quotations which have been made from wdiat I wrote. I would not alter a sentence after the 16 years that have passed, but I must say I think it rather misleading to quote so extensively from\me part of the despatch without indicating what was its main purpose. Theparticular paragraph quoted would do little to cool down the ardour of the zionist and little to reassure the apprehensions of the Arabs. The main purposeof the despatch was clear.   This is what I said in paragraph (1) :  &apos;&apos;His Majestys Government have no intention of repudiating theobligations into which they have entered towards the Jewish people.&quot;I then proceeded to say that the Government would refuse to discuss the futureof Palestine on any basis other than the basis of the Balfour Declaration.Moreover, the whole tenor of the despatch was to make it clear that the establish-ment of self-governing institutions in Palestine was to be subordinated to the paramount pledge and obligation of establishing a Jewish National Home inPalestine. In taking up this position on behalf of the Government of the day 1really was not going any further than the views which were ardently expressedby some of the ablest and most promising of our back-benchers at that time.The fact that they are leading Ministers to-day should, I think, have gained forthe problem of Palestine a more considered and more sympathetic treatment thanit has received.Last night the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs used asurprising argument. He suggested that the obligation to introduce self-governing institutions into Palestine ranked equally with the obligation toestablish a Jewish National Home. In this very despatch of mine, which represented the views of the entire Government of the day. the greatest painswere taken to make it clear that the paramount duty was the establishment of aNational Home.   It was said on page 6 :  &quot; The position is that His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound by a pledgewhich is antecedent to the Covenant of the League of Nations, and theycannot allow a constitutional position to develop in a country for which theyhave accepted responsibility to the principal Allied Powers which may makeit impracticable to carry into effect a solemn undertaking given by themselves and their Allies.&quot;There is much more to the same effect. It seems to me that the Under-Secretaryof State had some reason to complain of the manner in which he had been briefedon this subject, because his argument was exactly contrary to the tenor of thedespatch from which the Government have quoted with a strong expression of approval and agreement wherever they have found it possible to assist their case.Now I come to the gravamen of the case. I regret very much that the pledgeof the Balfour Declaration, endorsed as it has been by successive Governments,and the conditions under which we obtained the Mandate, have both been violatedby the Governments proposals. There is much in this White Paper which isalien to the spirit of the Balfour Declaration, but I will not trouble about that.I select the one point upon which there is plainly a breach and repudiation ofthe Balfour Declaration the provision that Jewish immigration can be stoppedin five years&apos; time by the decision of an Arab majority. That is a plain breach of a solemn obligation. I am astonished that my right hon. Friend the PrimeMinister, of all others, and at this moment above all others, should have lenthimself to this new and sudden default.To whom was the pledge of the Balfour Declaration made ? It was not madeto the Jews of Palestine, it was not made to those who were actually living in
Palestine. It was made to world Jewry and in particular to the Zionistassociations. It was in consequence of and on the basis of this pledge that we received important help in the war, and that after the war we received from theAllied and Associated Powers the Mandate for Palestine. This pledge of ahome of refuge, of an asylum, was not made to the Jews of Palestine, but to theJews outside Palestine, to that vast, unhappy mass of scattered, persecuted,wandering Jews whose intense, unchanging, unconquerable desire has been fora National Home to quote the words to which my right hon. Friend the PrimeMinister subscribed in the Memorial which he and others sent to us : &quot; the Jewish people who have through centuries of dispersion and persecu-tion patiently awaited the hour of its restoration to its ancestral home.&quot;Those are the words. They were the people outside, not the people in. It isnot with the Jews in Palestine that we have now or at any future time to deal,but with world Jewry, with Jews all over the world. That is the pledge whichwas given, and that is the pledge which we are now asked to break, for how canthis pledge be kept, I want to know, if in five years&apos; time the National Home isto be barred and no more Jews are to be allowed in without the permission ofthe Arabs?I entirely accept the distinction between making a Jewish National Home inPalestine and making Palestine a Jewish National Home. I think I was one ofthe first to draw that distinction. The Government quote me, and they seem to associate me with them on this subject in their White Paper, but what sort ofNational Home is offered to the Jews of the world when we are asked to declare that in five years&apos; time the door of that home is to be shut and barred in theirfaces ? The idea of home to wanderers is, surely, a place to which they canresort. When grievous and painful words like &quot; breach of pledge,&quot; &quot; repudia-tion &quot; and &quot;default&quot; are used in respect of the public action of men and ministers who in private life observe a stainless honour the country must discuss these matters as they present themselves in their public aspect it is necessary tobe precise, and to clo them justice His Majesty&apos;s Government have been brutallyprecise. On page 11 of the White Paper, in Sub-Section (3) of paragraph 14,there is this provision :  &quot; After the period of five years no further Jewish immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it.&quot;Now. there is the breach; there is the violation of the pledge; there is theabandonment of the Balfour Declaration; there is the end of the vision, of thehope, of the dream. If you leave out those words this White Paper is no morethan one of the several experiments and essays in Palestinian constitution-making which we have had of recent years, but put in those three lines and thereis the crux, the peccant point, the breach, and we must have an answer to it.My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs may use his great legal ability. He is full of knowledge and power and ingenuity, but unless this can be answered, and repulsed, and repudiated, a very great slur restsupon British administration. It is said specifically on page 10 of the white paper that Jewish immigration during the next five years will be at a rate which,if the economic absorptive capacity allows, will bring the population up to approximately one-third of the total population of the country. After that theArab majority, twice as numerous as the Jews, will have control, and all furtherJewish immigration will be subject to their acquiescence, which is only another way of saying that it will be on sufferance. What is that but the destruction ofthe Balfour Declaration ? What is that but a breach of faith ? What is it but a one-sided denunciation what is called in the jargon of the present time a unilateral denunciation of an engagement?There need be no dispute about this phrase &quot; economic absorptive capacity.&quot;It represented the intentions of the Government and their desire to carry out the palestinian Mandate in an efficient and in a prudent manner. As I am the author of the phrase, perhaps I may be allowed to state that economic absorptive capacity was never intended to rule without regard to any other considerationIt has always rested with the Mandatory Power to vary the influx of the Jews inaccordance with what was best for Palestine and for the sincere fulfilment one must presuppose the sincere fulfilment of our purpose in establishing a JewishNational Flome there. It was never suggested at any time that the decision aboutthe quota to be admitted should rest with the Jews or should rest with the Arabs.It rested, and could only rest at any time, with the Mandatory Power which was[25356a] b 2
responsible for carrying out the high purpose of the then victorious Allies. TheMandatory Commission of the League of Nations, as was mentioned by the spokesman for the Opposition Avhen ho opened the Debate this afternoon, hasrecognised fully that the Mandatory Power was entitled to control the flow of immigration, or even to suspend it in an emergency. What they are not entitledto do, at least not entitled to do without reproach grave, public and world-widereproach, and I trust self-reproach as well is to bring the immigration to an endso far as they are concerned, to wash their hands of it, to close the door. Thatthey have no right whatever to do.I cannot feel that we have accorded to the Arab race unfair treatment afterthe support which they gave us in the late war. The Palestinian Arabs, ofcourse, were for the most part fighting against us. but elsewhere over vast regionsinhabited by the Arabs independent Arab kingdoms and principalities have comeinto being such as had never been known in Aral) history before. Some havebeen established by Great Britain and others by France. When I wrote this despatch in 1922 I was advised by, among others. Colonel Lawrence, the truestchampion of Arab rights whom modern times have known. He has recorded hisopinion that the settlement was fair and just his definite settled opinion.Together we placed the Emir Abdulja in Transjordania, where he remainsfaithful and prosperous to this clay. Together, under the responsibility of thePrime Minister of those days. King Feisal was placed upon the throne of Iraq,where his descendants now rule.&apos; But we also showed ourselves continuallyresolved to close no door upon the ultimate developments of a Jewish national home, fed by continual Jewish immigration into Palestine. Colonel Lawrencethought this was fair then.    Why should it be pretended that it is unfair now ?I cannot understand what are the credentials of the Government in thismatter of Palestine. It is less than two years about 18 months if I rememberaright since they came forward and on their faith and reputation, with all their knowledge and concerted action, urged us to adopt a wholly different solutionfrom that which they now place before us. The House persuaded them then notto force us into an incontinent acceptance of their partition plan, and within afew months, though they did not thank us for it. thev had themselves abandoned and discarded it as precipitately as they had adopted it. Why. now, should they thrust this far more questionable bundle of expedients upon us? Surely itwould only be prudent and decent for the Government, following the advice givenby the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he was a private Member in 1930.following the opinion of the jurists of those days, to ascertain the view taken bythe Mandates Commission of the League of Nations, before whom these proposals are to go. before claiming a Parliamentary decision in their favour.I cannot understand why this course has been taken. I search around for the answer. The first question one would ask oneself is foreshadowed in a reference made in the speech of my hon. Friend, and is this : Is our condition so parlous andour state so poor that we must, in our weakness, make this sacrifice of our declaredpurpose ? Although I have been very anxious that we should strengthen ourarmaments and spread our alliances and so increase the force of our position. i must say that I have not taken such a low view of the strength of the BritishEmpire or of the very many powerful countries who desire to walk in association with us: but if the Government, with their superior knowledge of the deficiencies in our armaments which have arisen during their stewardship, really feel that weare too weak to carry out our obligations and wish to file a, petition in moral and physical bankruptcy, that is an argument which, however ignominious, should certainly weigh with the Ffouse in these dangerous times. But is it true? I donot believe it is true. 1 cannot believe that tho task to which we set our hand20 years ago in Palestine is beyond our strength, or that faithful perseverancewill not. in the end. bring that task through to a glorious success. I am sure of this, that to cast the plan aside and show yourselves infirm of will and unableto pursue a long, clear and considered purpose, bending and twisting under thecrush and pressure of events I am sure that that is going to do us a most serious and grave injury at a time like this.We must ask ourselves another question, which arises out of this : Can we and this is the question strengthen ourselves by this repudiation? Shallwe relieve ourselves by this repudiation? I should have thought that theplan put forward by the Colonial Secretary in his White Paper, withits arid&apos; constitutional ideas and safety catches at every point, and withvagueness overlaying it and through all of it. combines, so far as one canunderstand it at present, the disadvantages of all courses without the advantages of any.   The triumphant Arabs have rejected if.   They are not going to put up
with it. The despairing Jews will resist it. What will the world think about it ?What will our friends say? What will be the opinion of the United States ofAmerica? Shall we not lose more and this is a question to be consideredmaturely in the growing support and sympathy of the United States than weshall gain in local administrative convenience, if gain at all indeed we do?What will our potential enemies think ? What will those who have beenstirring up these Arab agitators think? Will they not be encouraged by ourconfession of recoil? Will they not be tempted to say: &quot; They&apos;re on the runagain. This is another Munich,&quot; and be the more stimulated in their aggression by these very unpleasant reflections which they may make ? After all, we were asked by the Secretary of State to approach this question in a spirit.of realismand to face the real facts, and I ask seriously of the Government: Shall we notundo by this very act of abjection some of the good which we have gained by ourguarantees to Poland and to Roumania, by our admirable Turkish Alliance and by what we hope and expect will be our Russian Alliance? You must consider thesematters. May not this be a contributory factor and every factor is a contributory factor now by which our potential enemies may be emboldened totake some irrevocable action and then find out, only after it is all too late, thatit is not this Government, with their tired Ministers and flagging purpose, thatthey have to face, but the might of Britain and all that Britain means ?It is hoped to obtain five years of easement in Palestine by this proposal;surely the consequences will be entirely the opposite. A sense of moral weaknessin the mandatory Power, whose many years of vacillation and uncertainty have,as the right hon. Gentleman admitted yesterday, largely provoked the evils fromwhich we suffer, will arouse all the violent elements in Palestine to the utmostdegree. In order to avoid the reproach, the bitter reproach, of shutting outrefugees during this time of brutal persecution, the quota of immigration maybe raised, as we were told by the Secretary of State, and may be continued at an even higher level in the next five years. Thus, irritation will continue and the incentive to resist will be aggravated. What about these five years? Who shallsay where we are going to be five years from now ? Europe is more than two-thirdsmobilised to-night. The ruinous race of armaments now carries whole populationsinto the military machine. That cannot possibly continue for five years, nor for four,nor for three years. It may be that it will not continue beyond the present year.Long before those five years are past, either there wdll be a Britain which knowshow to keep its word on the Balfour Declaration and is not afraid to do so, or,believe me, we shall find ourselves relieved of many overseas responsibilities otherthan those comprised within the Palestine Mandate.Some of us hold that our safety at this juncture resides in being bold and strong. We urge that the reputation for fidelity of execution, strict execution,of public contracts, is a shield and buckler which the British Empire, howeverit may arm, cannot dispense with and cannot desire to dispense with. Neverwas the need for fidelity and firmness more urgent than now. You are not goingto found and forge the fabric of a grand alliance to resist aggression, except byshowing continued examples of your firmness in carrying out, even underdifficulties, and in the teeth of difficulties, the obligations into which you have entered. I warn the Conservative party and some of my warnings have not, alas,been ill-founded that by committing themselves to this lamentable act ofdefault they will cast our country, and all that it stands for, one more stepdownwards in its fortunes, which step will later on have to be retrieved,as it will be retrieved, by additional hard exertions. That is why I say that upon the large aspect of this matter the policy which you think is a relief and an easement you will find afterwards you will have to retrieve, insuffering and greater exertions than those we are making.I end upon the &quot;land of Palestine. It is strange indeed that we should turnaway from our task in Palestine at the moment when, as the Secretary of Statetold us yesterday, the local disorders have been largely mastered. It is strangerstill-that we should turn away when the great experiment and bright dream, the historic dream, has proved its power to succeed. Yesterday the minister responsible descanted eloquently in glowing passages upon the magnificent workwhich the Jewish colonists have done. They have made the desert&quot; bloom. Theyhave started a score of thriving industries, he said. They have founded a greatcity on the barren shore. They have harnessed the Jordan and spread its electricitythroughout the land. So far from being persecuted, the Arabs have crowded intothe country and multiplied till their population has increased more than even allworld Jewry could lift up the Jewish population. Now we are asked to decree,that all this is to stop and all this is to come to an end.   We are now asked to
submit and this is what rankles most with me to an agitation which is fedwith foreign money and ceaselessly inflamed by Nazi and by Fascist propaganda.It is 20 years ago since my right hon. Friend used these stirring words : &quot; A great responsibility will rest upon the Zionists, who, before low,will be proceeding, with joy in their hearts, to the ancient seat of their people!Theirs will be the task to build up a new prosperity and a new civilisation inold Palestine, so long neglected and mis-ruled.&quot;Well, they have answered his call. They have fulfilled his hopes. How can hefind it in his heart to strike them this mortal blow?
