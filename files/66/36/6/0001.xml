THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT&apos; - ----&quot; ---T&quot;&apos;3 37T.P. (,^3ft 1,5,6Memorandum by the Minister of ffoongmig Warfare.Germany is living on credit.Her ability to man her war mashineand to obtain the raw materials and manufactures of the European neutrals andsatellites depends upon the fresh advances of man-power and export credit facilities whioh those oountries can be induced to make.    It is theso advanoeswhich part^j enable her to finance her imports of guns, fuses and machine toolsfrom Switzerland;    iron ore from Sweden;   wolfram from Portugalj   iron ore andwolfram from Spain;   bauxite from Hungary, and oil from Roumanian2*       Without theso credits Germany would be fox-cod either to reduce herimportation of goods vital to her wor effort, or to devote labour and material to increasing her exports, thus intensifying the strain on her man-power andtransport;   or possibly to surrender the gold reserves with which she has been so reluctant ho part ever since 1 %0*3*       As the balance of the war tips against the Germans, their creditorsare naturally unwilling to add to their commitments.   Spain and Sweden havealready shewn some firmness in resisting demands for fresh credits;   Roumaniahas, we believe,^been sufficiently stubborn to force the Germans to pay gold inpart settlements of the clearing debt;   Hungary has managed to insist on the handing; over of a large part of German assets in Hungarian territory.    the realisation at this stage that these claims on Germany would rank considerablylower than those of the Allies, and that they would probably be irrecoverablewould, I believe, have a most salutary effect,if*     I had intended to raise thi3 question through the Malkin Committee,and to suggest a public announcement by the United Nations that credits of thiskind were of direct benefit to the German war effort, and would not berecognised as claims in the post-war settlement.    The issue has, however,been /
boon &quot;brought to a head by tho Swiss, who have just sent a delegation to BoirLinto negotiate a now trade agreement.    In order to secure future deliveries ofcoal and oil, and to induce the Germans to make good the deficit in coaldeliveries under a previous agreement, they propose to allow the debit in the clearing to rise to 850,000,000 Swiss francs (it was already 570,000,000 Swis3francs on 1 st March last and also to grant a further credit of x francs perton of coal delivered in exce^n of 150,000 tons monthly.    The exact amount is left open for discussion.5* Although the Swiss have simultaneously assured-us that they intend to press for a reduction in future deliveries to Germany of fuses, machine toolsIaand other manufactures of the highest war priority, I feel no confidence that thwill achieve this object, and in any case it would be several months before wocould expect to see a 3ubstantio.l reduction.    In the meantime Switzerland, with;her well-equipped factories and unique resources of liighly-skillod labour wouldbe supplying tho enemy at -an increased rate.   Various methods of dissuasion are under active consideration by the Departments concerned, but, in the meantime,intimation that the credits granted would not be recognised in the post-warsettlements as claims against the Axis countries, or at any rate that they wouldrank well below Allied claims for reparations, might be of considerable value.6* A public announcement in the 301130 suggested would involve consultantwith the United States and other Allies, and would necessarily take some time.I therefore seek authority:-(a) Immediately to inform the Swiss (and any other neutraj.3 who may meanwhile:be contemplating the grant of new credits to Germany) that this matter is bclifconsidered by the United Nations, and that in HsM^C^s view any credits granted;Eduring the war and outstanding at its end will either be bad debts or at best i will rank below the not-inconsiderable Allied olaima for reparations for war damage, and that in no circumstances will wo assist in the collection of suohimdebts to neutrals and satellites;(b) To open discussions with tho United Ssates Government and other AlliedGovernment with a view to the issue of a United Nations Declaration on tho %mindicated in Paragraph 4 above, fliSiMinistry of Economic ffarfore15th April, 1943*
