Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 191.May 3, 1943.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN DISCUSSIONS AT BERMUDA ON REFUGEEPROBLEMS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foretgn Affairs.I think that my colleagues may like to see the annexed note on theBermuda Conference, which I have received from Mr. Richard Law. the leader of the British Delegation. The Report agreed upon by the British and AmericanDelegations has now been received and.will be circulated as soon as possible.A. E.Foreign Office. May 3, 1943., ANNEX.THERE are one or two reflections which I would like to pass on to you onthe Conference.The Position of the A mericans.I can well imagine that you and the Cabinet will feel that the americans have been grudging and ungenerous about making any direct contribution oftheir own. It is necessary, however, to remember that their position differs fromours in one material respect.We are subjected to extreme pressure from an alliance of Jewish organisa-tions and Archbishops. There is no counter-pressure as yet from the people whoare afraid of an alien immigration into the country because it will put theirlivelihood in jeopardy after the war. I have no doubt in my own mind that thatfeeling is widespread in England, but it is not organised so we do not feel it.In the United States, on the other hand, there is added to the pressure ofthe Jewish organisations the pressure of that body of opinion which, without being purely anti-Semitic, is jealous and fearful of an alien immigration per se.And, in contradistinction to the position at home, that body of opinion is veryhighly organised indeed.The Americans, therefore, while they must do their utmost to placate Jewishopinion, dare not offend &quot; American &quot; opinion. If they have a collision withthis American opinion they would be in some danger of a revision of theirexisting quota laws; in that case they would be unable to make any directcontribution whatever to a solution of the problem.The present position is not so unsatisfactory as it seems. They are unable,however, to declare publicly what the present position is. If it were known inthe United States how the Administration were manipulating existing legislation in favour of refugees there would be a row. For instance, I was under theimpression before I came out here that it took eight or nine months for an individual to get through the State Department visa and security controls. Infact it takes six to eight weeks. It is a fact, too, that they give priority torefugees from Europe whose lives are in danger. And it is a fact that under existing legislation there is an unexpended balance in the German-Austrianquota which would take care of refugees, e.g., from Spain, in very substantial numbers.   But use can only be made of the quota if there is no great song and12023   [253841
dance about it. I am satisfied that if a shipping opportunity could be foundthey could take one or two thousand into the States provided there was no greatpublicity. But if there was a great to-do beforehand they would not be able toattempt it.The American domestic position, in short, is very much like the generalrefugee position. If we were to announce with emphasis that we proposed toremove all refugees from Spain, the Spaniards would be scared and we shouldbe impotent. In the same way, if the Administration were to declare that theywere going to make a substantial direct contribution Congress would reactviolently and the Administration would be impotent. But that does not mean that they will not do their best. Nor does it. mean that they would not be ableto make some kind of an offer to the Intergovernmental Committee as an inducement, provided that the offer was made privately and without publicity.I think that they are genuinely anxious to play their part. They want toappease the Jewish organisations if they can do so without causing mortal offence to domestic American opinion.. If. however, it came to a show-down. Jew andGentile. I am satisfied that their internal position is such that they would haveto tell the Jewish organisations to go to hell.Before we condemn them too much for their callousness we should remember(a) that we have not got a general election advancing inexorably upon us in acomparatively short time, and (b) that we have the same kind of selfishness athome, only it is latent and still unorganised. (But. personally, my feeling is thatwe ought not to ignore it altogether, and we must not make some magnificentgesture to the Archbishops now only to find that in twelve or eighteen mouths&apos;time the average man. moyen sensual, turns and rends us.)Intergovernmental Committee.My feeling is that something can be made of this. But it must be (a) an efficient organisation and (/;) the public must believe in it. From both these points of view I attach enormous value to having two or three full-time paid executives.So long as you limit it to one full-time director and a few stuffed-shirts&quot; whosefunction is really little more than that of the patrons of a charity matinee it willcommand no confidence. It should be a full-time, indeed life-time, job for any man of ability. I would not get rid of Fmerson, but I would support him with two or three first-class men if you can find them. Whether or not you can findthem will depend in some measure upon whether you can give them a salary and powers sufficient to make it worth their while.If you can get the Committee going I believe that it can do a great deal forrefugees, and that it will be a very useful piece of technical international machinery of the kind I am always hankering after for the brave new world.Shipping.This is the crux. It may be a difficult problem, but it is not a large problem.Three or four ships could do a tremendous lot, both in transporting and main-taining refugees. One ship could do a great deal. If neutral shipping isunobtainable, is it really beyond the bounds of possibility that we should findone ship? I know all the arguments, but I believe, too, that bread does return from the waters and that the story of the Good Samaritan is still valid.General.I hope you are not disappointed by the results of our endeavours. Theycould never be anything but meagre. And yet I believe that if this is followed up with vigour it will have been well worth while. I am confident, too, that theConference will have had some effect upon Anglo-American relations in general.An atmosphere of confidence has been created which, I feel sure, will be reflected in the State Department.I am sorry that I shall not be at hand to help you defend the position. AndI am sorry that these notes are so scrappy, but it has been a rush the last few days.Refugee Debate.It is important that any statement that is made bearing directly on Bermudashould be agreed with the Americans textually. It is important that nothing should be said, by way of defence of the American position, that implies thatthey are manipulating existing legislation in order to contribute to a solutionof the problem.
