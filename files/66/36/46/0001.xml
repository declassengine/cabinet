Printed for the War Cabinet   May 1943.SECRET. Copy No. 0 0W.P. (43) 196.May 10, 1943.WAR CABINET.GOVERNMENT BUILDING PROGRAMME FOR period april-SEPTEMBER 1943.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.AT the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 21st April* I was asked to frameproposals for allocating to the various departmental programmes the building labour available, under existing man-power decisions, for the six months April to september 1943, on the understanding that this would necessarily involve drasticcuts in Departmental requirements as provisionally stated.Civil Departments and Housing.2. (a) As explained in my earlier paper, W.P. (43) 149. the figures includedin that paper for the &apos;-&apos; Civil Departments &quot; represented not their stated require-ments but my view of the lowest figure to which they could be reduced if essential services were to be maintained. I am therefore unable to suggest any appreciablefurther cut under this head, and propose only a slightly more rapid scaling down of the global allocation for these Departments (line 7 of the table).(b) The smaller figure now proposed for the repair of Damaged Houses isbased on a recent estimate of the number of houses that can be repaired within the agreed financial limits (20,000) (line 8 of the table).(c) The Lord Presidents Committee have recently considered the proposalsfor rural housing provisionally approved in January! and have asked for certain aspects of the scheme to be re-examined. My proposals therefore allow for.000 men for this purpose from July onwards as an addition to locally availablelabour (line 9 of the table).(d) If this is approved I recommend that comparable provision should bemade to meet the needs of Scotland. I propose that allowance should be madeaccordingly for 500 men for Scotland, again as an addition to locally availableLabour (line 10 of the table). Men should not be made available from the generalpool unless it is clear that the greatest possible use is being made of local immobilelabour.Supply and Service Departments.3. On the assumption that provision must be made as in the preceding paragraph &quot;for the needs of the Civil Departments and housing, the table in the annex shows the balance available each month for the Service and supply departments (line headed &quot; Totals 1-6 &quot;). The table also shows for each Depart-ment for each month (a) the Labour requirement as stated to me and set out in W.P. (43) 149;(b) the effect of a pro rata reduction applied to each Department to fit thetotal available; and(c) my proposals for each Department,* W.M. (43) 57th Conclusions, Minute 6.f W.M. (43) 12th Conclusions, Minute 4 (1):   L.P. (43) 29th Meeting, Minute 2.[25417]
4. The following- notes indicate briefly the grounds on which these proposals are based : (1) Admiralty.(a) I have thought it reasonable to allow for a small difference between therequirements as stated and the probable rate at which Admiralty contracts willactually be able to absorb labour.(b) Some reduction could be secured in the airfield programme if full use ismade of R.A.F. airfields for meeting naval needs. The First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Secretary of State for Air should lie asked to ensure that thiswill be done.(c) Efforts should be made to increase the proportion of constructional workon shipyards and fitting-out facilities to be canned out in Northern Ireland.(The proposals in this paper relate to Great Britain only.)(d) The maximum use should be made of existing factories so as to reducethe construction programme under this head.(2) War Office.(a) The War Office requirements as stated drop sharply after the end ofOctober to a labour force of about 20,000 men. In view of the limited man-power available, it seems inevitable that their requirements should be more evenlyspread out. even if this involves postponing the dates for the completion of someitems in the programme.(b) I have been informed by the Secretary of State for War that his require-ments can be reduced by 500 a month from the 30th June onwards as a result ofan agreement that the Americans shall take over certain existing hospitals witha consequent saving in the amount of new building required.(c) Exceptionally good progress has been made with the War Office-programme in recent months owing to the mild weather and the fact that thelabour force engaged on the programme has been considerably large!&apos; than thatallocated.(d) I do not consider that any civilian.....building labour disputes  should be madeavailable for the construction of emplacements for 5-25-inch A.A. and CD/A.A.guns. (The requirements as shown in the table include 2.000 men for this purposefrom June omvards.)(3) A ir Ministry.(a) The stated requirements remain as given to me last January, when theywere presumably based on an estimate of normal progress to be made during theremaining winter months. In fact, owing to the exceptionally mild weather,there has been an increased, output per man in the first three months of 1943 ofat least 20 per cent, as compared with the corresponding period of 1942. If the equivalent of 80,000-100,000 man-months has been gained in the first three monthsof the year, this will be no more than offset by a reduction of 10,000 men in thelabour force for the 6 months April to September, allowing for the difference in value between winter and summer man-months.(6) I appreciate the need for providing airfields for British and LhiitedStates squadrons as they become available, and understand that in some respectsthere is reason to state requirements at the relevant dates somewhat higher thanthey were but a short time ago; but if some risks must be run in this, as in other,fields, it must be borne in mind that airfields can be used in an emergency, whenrunways, &amp;c, have been constructed, even if all buildings, &amp;c, are not complete(runways, perimeter tracks and hard standings represent a little over 50 per cent,of the total cost of airfields). We cannot in present circumstances afford to plancompletion dates on the assumption that next winter will be a. thoroughly badbuilding season.(4) Minstry of Aircraft Production.I consider that the labour force proposed will enable us to meet the essential needs of the aircraft production programme.(5) Ministry of Supply.The Ministry of Supply programme is largely in connexion with &quot; commonuser &quot; production (e.g., Iron and Steel) for the benefit of all Departments and services alike.
((!) Ministry of War Trans-port.The programme as presented would require an increase in the labour forceallocated to the Department for the first quarter of the year (9,800). In presentcircumstances I am unable to recommend more than a very small increase and suggest that savings should be secured by postponing work on some parts of the highway maintenance programme, by the strongest possible measures to securethat full use shall be made of local authorities&apos; permanent staff, and by somepostponement of the programme for the construction of accommodation for gasproducer units. Upwards of 1,000 men are required, for the repair of damage to roads in tank training areas. It is clearly very desirable to reduce this demandso far as possible, and I suggest that the Secretary of State for War should beinvited to investigate the possibility of reducing the amount of damage.5. This constitutes, in my opinion, the best method of dividing up the limitedlabour force available under the decision given by the War Cabinet on the21st April If these proposals will not meet necessary operational requirements,the only alternative would be some postponement .oi the &quot;call-up&quot; from thebuilding industry so as to increase the labour force available. -O.
