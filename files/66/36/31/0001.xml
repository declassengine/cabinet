Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 181.April 29, 1943.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR AGRICULTURAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal, the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the minister without Portfolio.ON the 15th April, the War Cabinet decided (W.M. (43) 55, Conclusion 1)that it would be premature to authorise discussions at the present stage with theAgricultural interests in this country on the basis of the proposals set out in w.P. (43) 103. The purpose of this paper is not to ask our colleagues to go backon this decision, but to draw their attention to a difficult situation which seems likely to arise in the immediate future, and to ask for their guidance.2. A question has been put down by Mr. Ronald Tree, M.P.. in the. Houseof Commons for answer on the next sitting day, &quot; to ask the Prime Minister whenthe Government intends to make known its policy in regard to post-waragriculture.&quot;In addition, the following motion in the name of Lord Perry has been putdown for discussion in the House of Lords on the second sitting clav after the9th May :-&quot; To call attention to the economic and social necessities arising out ofthe decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government that a healthy and well-balancedagriculture should be a permanent feature of national policy.&quot;3. It seems to us necessary that some exolanation should be given of thecontinued absence of any Government declaration on this question. At present there is a general assumption that discussions are about to be initiated in view ofthe statement of the Minister without Portfolio in the House of Commons on the1st December, 1942. That statement (made in the Debate on the Address) was asfollows :  &quot; My right hon. Friend announced a temporary policy on the26th November, 1940, which was to hold the field until some permanentpolicy could be worked out. We have been giving very close attention toformulating a satisfactory, permanent post-war policy. Of course, it is a problem which covers a very wide field, and it has to be considered inconnection with other studies and considerations of national policy. Theymust take time, especially as many of those engaged on them are also engaged on urgent war-time work, but we have made considerable progress. My right. hon. Friends the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State forScotland hope that they will be in a position early in the New Year to embark upon preliminary discussions with the industry.&quot;4. The debate in the House of Lords will undoubtedly proceed on this assumption. On the last occasion on Which a discussion took place on the subject,the position was held with some difficulty, and. though the House will no doubt be reluctant to press to a division a motion on a matter&apos; of such first-class importance in war time, there is no doubt that another failure by the Govern-ment to announce any progress, after the statement made by the Minister without portfolio in December last, which was specifically approved by the War Cabinet,[25368]Copy No.
not only will be received with deep dissatisfaction in the House, but will giverise to increasing suspicions among the agricultural community as to the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the future of the industry,and to unfavourable and damaging public comment. Some explanation of thecontinued delay seems therefore necessary.5. There is a real danger that any suggestions that discussions with theagricultural industry are being deferred, either pending negotiations with theDominions or the United States, or in view of the forthcoming Food conference or any other international discussions, would only tend to increase the doubts ofagriculturists as to the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to stand by theirdeclaration that they would maintain after the war a healthy and well-balancedagriculture as an essential and permanent feature of national policy.6.   We recommend that the Government spokesman be empowered (a) to make it clear that there has been no change in the weight which theGovernment attaches to the importance of the maintenance of a healthy and well-balanced agriculture after the war as a permanent feature of national policy;(b) to state that it has not proved possible, at the present stage of the war,for the War Cabinet to carry its consideration of the problems involved in the formulation of a permanent post-war agricultural policy to a point at which Ministers can usefully embark on detailed discussions with the industry, but that all aspects of such a policy areat present under examination by the Ministers concerned, in the spiritof the undertaking given by the Government spokesman under (a)above.In view of the considerable issues involved, it seems a matter in which adecision by the War Cabinet is required.C.E.
