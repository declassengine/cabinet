(43) 158.April 16, 1943.WAR CABINET.SHACKLING OF PRISONERS OF WAR.PROPOSED STATEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 17th March His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne received from the swiss Government a full summary of the German Governments reply to thestatement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom and Canadawhich he had handed to the Swiss Foreign Minister on the 12th February.A copy of Mr. Norton&apos;s telegram containing this reply is annexed.   (Annex 1.)2. The German Government states that it is unable to accept our declara-tion as satisfactory, and maintains the view that our prohibition in principle ofshackling is made completely illusory by the reservation of the circumstances inwhich prisoners of war may temporarily be bound during operations. it therefore continues to make the withdrawal of the reprisal measures conditional on the issue of categorical instructions to our armed forces forbidding undersevere penalty any shackling of prisoners of war, together with the possessionof shackles for this purpose.3. I believe my colleagues are generally agreed that we must maintain ourpresent position and continue to press for the removal of the reprisal measures.The disadvantage of this course is that, if it is adopted, there is no presentprospect of our prisoners of war being unshackled; on the other hand, to acceptwithout reservation the German demand would involve the prohibition of certain measures of restraint which are not only in our view consistent with a trueinterpretation of the provisions of the Geneva Convention, but have hitherto been regarded as necessary for the efficient conduct of military operations.4. It will be necessary in the near future, in response to the public demandfor information, to make some statement on the present position. There are,moreover, two parliamentary questions down for Wednesday, the 21st April, onthis subject, and I therefore circulate, for the consideration of the War Cabinet,the draft of an answer which might be given to these two questions, explaining the position. (Annex 2.) The Canadian Government and the Swiss Governmenthave been asked for their comments on this draft.5. A copy of the statement which was handed to the Swiss Government onthe 12th February is also attached.   (Annex 3.)&quot;* A. E.Foreign Office, April 16, 1943.Copy No.1.2011[25316]
Mr. Norton to Mr. Eden.(No. 1283.)(Telegraphic.) Berne, March 17, 1943.FOLLOWING is full summary of German Government^ reply to the recentdeclaration of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom and Canadaas communicated to me by the Swiss Government :  &quot; The German Government has taken note of the declaration of the Britishand Canadian Governments as communicated by the Swiss Government on18th February in the question of shackling of prisoners of war. The GermanGovernment can only conclude that these two Governments are still adopting an attitude which is incompatible with terms of the Geneva Prisoners of war convention, and with the most elementary rule of humane and soldierly conductof war.&quot; It is. indeed, stated in the declaration that shackling of prisoners is inprinciple forbidden to British and Canadian troops, that handcuffs might not.therefore, &quot;be carried by the latter, and that the disregard of these orders wouldbe punished as contrary to discipline. The declaration, however, goes on toemphasise that shackling of prisoners is permissible, and even a matter of duty,if it appears to be called for by the particular circumstances of operations inorder to prevent the flight or overcome the resistance of a captured soldier.&quot; It is obvious that prohibition in principle of shackling is made completelyillusory by this reservation. It is thus in practice left entirely to the full choice of British and Canadian troops to extend the shackling of captured Germansoldiers to any extent and to act in this respect in future as they acted in Dieppeand Sark. as shown by sworn protocol published by German Army.&quot; If it is brought out in the declaration that British and Canadian troopscarry no handcuffs, this point has no significance. The German Government has never complained that German nationals were handcuffed : on the contrary, itis clear from the protocol that captured German soldiers in question wereshackled with cords by British and Canadian troops, and. indeed, in the mostbrutal manner and with refined cruelty. Since the British and Canadian Govern-ments in their present declaration hold out this conduct as being permissible andin certain circumstances even necessary, it is plain that their troops are equipped with the corresponding means of shackling.&quot; The allegation in the declaration that shackling is in certain circumstancesa less evil, and in the interests of security of prisoners, is an empty and speciousargument. The German Government can claim in comparison with British and canadian forces an incomparably greater bringing of prisoners, and needs noinstruction in law and usages of war. German soldiers have never shackledBritish or Canadian soldiers after capturing them, and have never felt the need of such a measure. It is therefore ^completely out of place for British and canadian Governments now to attempt to give lessons to the German Army. TheGerman Government continues firmly to maintain the attitude that all shacklingof prisoners of war is inadmissible nor can it be justified by arguments of any kind. The German Government have, therefore, made the withdrawal of reprisalmeasures to which they were forced by shackling law carried out by British and canadian troops dependent on their obtaining security against the danger that german prisoners of war should be shackled in future. The German Governmenthas, therefore, made the simple demand, which, indeed, as the matter stands, isa matter of course, that British and Canadian Governments should issue to their troops a complete categorical and general order which would forbid under severepenalty any shackling of prisoners of war together with possession of shacklesfor this purpose. This demand of the German Government is not met by presentdeclaration of the two Governments. On the contrary, that declaration proves,that the danger of German prisoners being shackled by British or canadian troops will continue to exist in future. The British and Canadian Governments,therefore, alone bear the responsibility if measures of reprisals exercised on theGerman side against British and Canadian prisoners of war continue in force.&quot;Text and translation by Swiss bag.
*64. Major-General Sir Alfred Knox. To ask the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, if he can now make a statement on the shackling ofBritish prisoners of war in German camps. [2nd Sitting Day after the18th April], i.e., Wednesday, the 21st April.*52. Colonel Sir Lambert Ward. To ask the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, whether he is aware that British prisoners of war atStalag VIII B are still chained and handcuffed; and can he make any statement as to the progress of the negotiations to secure the release ofthese men. [Deferred from 3rd Sitting Day after the 11th April till2nd Sitting Day after the 18th April.&apos;]Draft Reply.I AM aware that British prisoners are still sTiackled both at Stalag VIII Band at other camps.On the 11th February last I told the House that a communication had beensent on that day to the Swiss Government with the request that the views ofHis Majesty!s Government on the question of shackling set out therein shouldbe conveyed to the German Government. The reply of the German Governmenthas recently been communicated to me, through the same channel, and I thinkthat Members, who have been very patient upon this distressing matter, should know the piesent position.The Geneva Convention lays down generally that prisoners of war must behumanely treated, and the point at issue between His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe German Government is what constitutes such treatment. The Geneva,Convention gives very little guidance on this question and lays down no rule aboutthe shackling or binding of prisoners during operations.The German Government assert that they will renounce the measures ofreprisal taken against our prisoners only on receipt of an assurance that instruc-tions have been issued to our forces forbidding the shackling of german prisoners in any circumstances whatsoever. We informed the Swiss Government,in the communication sent on the 11th February, and they in turn informed theGerman Government, that instructions had been issued to our armed forces toensure that all ranks should be acquainted with, and observe, the terms of the geneva Convention, and that, in those instructions, it had been made clear thata general order to bind prisoners is illegal and that the issue of any such order is strictly forbidden. The instructions, however, went on to say that circum-stances may arise in which the binding of prisoners may be necessary and may.indeed, be in the best interest of the prisoner himself. It is the duty of a prisoner during operations to try to escape and to impede his captors, who must,of course, prevent such action. In such circumstances binding, which must becarried out in a humane manner, is permissible, always provided that it is discon-tinued as soon as immediate operational necessity allows. These views were dulycommunicated by the Swiss Minister for Foreign Affairs to the German Govern-ment, who have now replied that our prohibition in principle of shackling is madeillusory by the above reservation of circumstances, and they therefore insist oncompliance with their earlier demand.His Majesty&apos;s Government have and will continue scrupulously to observenot only *the terms but also the spirit of the Geneva Convention, Article 2 ofwhich lays down that prisoners of war shall &quot; at all times be humanely treatedand. protected.&quot; I should perhaps add that that article of the Convention, ofwhich Germany was a signatory, also provides that &quot; measures of reprisal against them are forbidden.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are considering what reply should now bereturned, for the information of the German Government, to the Swiss-Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, to whose skilful and patient handling of this matter I take this opportunity to pay public tribute.His Majesty&apos;s Government will, of course, continue to press for the removalof the German measures of reprisal.
Statement handed to Swiss Government on February 12.HIS Majesty5s Governments in the United Kingdom and in Canada acknow-ledge receipt of the communication handed by M. Filet Golaz to His Majesty&apos;minister at Berne on the 17th December informing him of the views of theGerman Government in regard to the binding of prisoners of war.2. His Majesty&apos;s Governments desire to take this opportunity to make plaintheir policy in this matter.3. His Majesty&apos;s Governments reaffirm their determination to adherescrupulously to the provisions of the Geneva Convention and they have taken steps, by the issue of orders to all Commanders in the field, to ensure that all ranksshall be acquainted with and observe the terms of the Convention, with particular reference to the treatment of prisoners of war immediately after capture. Inthese orders the general binding of prisoners of war is strictly forbidden.Attention, however, is called in these orders to the following consideration. Itis the duty of a prisoner of war during operations to escape or to impede hiscaptors if he can do so. It is equally the duty of every soldier to prevent any suchaction by a prisoner of war who may be in his keeping during operations. Thebinding of prisoners in fulfilment of this duty will only be countenanced whenparticular operational conditions make it essential in the interests of the safety of the prisoner and when any other action would be less humane; such measuremust be carried out in a humane manner and must be discontinued as soon as itis no longer required to prevent the prisoner escaping or impeding his captor.4. In the German communication it is asserted that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have attempted to establish a difference between the treatment of prisonersof war on the battlefield and their treatment when they have been brought intoenemy territory, and that they maintain that the principles of the geneva convention have no application on the battlefield.&apos;&apos; As will be clear from theorders, of which a summary is given in the preceding paragraph, the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments is that the express provisions of Article 1 of the geneva convention show that a combatant is deemed to be a prisoner of war and entitledto the protection accorded by the relevant provisions of that Convention as soonas he has been captured by the enemy. On this point, therefore, it appears thatthere is no disagreement between the two Governments.
