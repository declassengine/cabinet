(43) 16418/// April, 1943/war cabinet supply OF BOOKS AND MAGAZINES FOR THE forces memorandum  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR  WAR1. This memorandum is in part a progress report, called for by the Prime Minister,dealing with developments that have taken place since my memorandum (W.P.(42)468),on the supply of books and magazines for the Middle East, which was discussed at the148th (42) meeting of the War Cabinet on 2nd November, 1942. It also containsproposals to remedy the present shortage of reading matter for the Forces.2. As far as the Middle East is concerned the position continued to improve for ashort period after the War Cabinet last considered the matter, owing to various special and non-recurring factors. Thus between 17th November and 16th December, 1942,the Services Central Book Depot despatched 34,500 books and 141,050 magazines andjournals to the Middle East for all three Services. This was a considerable increase over the figures (14,000 books and 46,800 magazines on a monthly basis) reported asbeing despatched in paragraph 2 (6) of W.P.(42)468. This literature was distributedfree by the Book Depot; a certain quantity of books paid for by units themselves wasalso sent to Middle East.3. In addition, the special despatch by the Director-General of Welfare and education at the War Office of 17,000 books of the Penguin type, referred to in para-graph 3 (&amp;) of W.P.(42)468, was augmented before the end of October by an additionalconsignment of 12,000.4. The increased distribution by the Services Central Book Depot in november and December, 1942, referred to above, was largely due to the response to the appealmade in October by the Prime Minister, which had the immediate effect of doubling the number of mailbags coming into the Depot. The effect of this appeal, however,was only temporary. The supply of books and magazines from the public has againsunk to its previous low level and is gradually decreasing. In consequence the ServicesCentral Book Depot, since the middle of December, have only been able to despatchbooks and magazines to the Middle East at the rate of 3,500 books, 7,700 illustratedmagazines and 4,000 copies of &quot; Blighty &quot; a week, and even this rate has only been maintained as a result of cutting down the provision made for the Army at home.5. In order to complete the picture as far as Middle East is concerned it may beof interest to add that a report dated 27th November, 1942, from G.H.Q., Middle East,showed that 6,500 English newspapers produced in Egypt were being distributed dailyto the Eighth Army. Since that date, however, this number has been increased three-fold, under arrangements made by the Ministry of Information. In addition, thePublications Branch at G.H.Q. produce, according to the latest figures available:  (i) a weekly paper, &quot; Crusader &quot;, for the Eighth Army, of which 60,000 copiesare distributed free;(ii) a daily leaflet, &quot; Eighth Army News &quot;, of which 5,000 copies are distributedfree;(iii) a weekly magazine, &quot; Parade &quot;, with a circulation of 48,000, of which 36,000go to the troops;(iv) a weekly &quot; World Press Review &quot; with a circulation of 5,000, and(v) a fortnightlv magazine called &quot; Gen &quot;, which is a cross between &quot; TheReader&apos;s Digest &quot; and &quot; Lilliput &quot;, with a circulation of 26,000, of which18,000 go to the troops.
6. As regards troops in North Africa, restrictions on transport supplies made it most difficult to send out books and periodicals beiorc tne beginning oi feoruary. &apos;i&apos;neServices Central Book Depot then despatched 3,000 copies 01 selected useo Penguinbooks, 300 standard parceis each ot approximately 30 second-hand books, 300 rationparcels each containing about 70 assorted magazines, and 3,000 copies 01 the magazine&quot; Blighty &quot;. Since February, troops in North Africa have received their share 01 thesupplies of books, magazines and periodicals available tor distribution by the ServicesCentral Book Depot.7. As regards newspapers, copies of the &quot; Gibraltar Chronicle &quot; are sent to north africa, and a newspaper called &quot; Union Jack &quot;, with a circulation of 30,000, is producedthere for the troops and issued on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.8. In paragraph 4 of W.P.(42)468 I referred to the possible clanger to the supplyof books for the Forces inherent in the campaign for the national recovery of books,etc., for salvage purposes. Arrangements have been made by the Ministry of Supply,under which:  (a) suitably qualified local committees arrange fur the sorting at receiving depots ofsalvaged books, etc., and pick out books and magazines of special interestto the Services, and(6) the officer-in-charge of the Services Central Book Depot has been made a member ofthe Central Council of the National Book Appeal.So far a considerable quantity of books for the Forces has been selected from literaturecollected for salvage, but little has reached the Services Central Book Depot, owing todistribution being made locally by the Local Authorities who conduct the salvage campaigns.The Ministry of Supply have, however, written to Local Authorities, urging them to sendbooks and magazines to the Services Central Book Depot, and representatives of Commandwelfare officers are in close touch with local scrutiny committees. It is hoped that these measures will result in increased quantities of literature reaching the Services Central BookDepot.9. Since the War Cabinet decided, at their meeting in November mentioned above,against the suggestion that literature for all English speaking troops in the Lhiitcd kingdom should be provided from British sources, whilst America should be responsible for the supply to British and American troops overseas, an agreement has been reached with the american military authorities in London which avoids the objection to the original proposal, Underthe new scheme, which has been approved in Washington, an appeal will be made in theUnited States for books and magazines for the Forces of the United Nations ; these will besorted and packed in America, and a proportion placed at the disposal of the Services CentralBook Depot. This will not interfere with the present import into this country&apos; of Americanliterature for the use of United States Forces here ; nor will it affect the existing sources ofsupply for British troops here and overseas. It has also been agreed that if American Forcesin Great Britain wish to purchase books from British sources they will do so through tinServices Central Book Depot.10. ft is too early as yet to say what will be the results of this new scheme, which will naturally take some time to materialise. The view has, however, been expressed by theBritish Military Attache in Washington that it is doubtful whether this scheme will produce any material supplement to our existing supplies of literature for the Forces. It has alsoto be noted that, owing to transport conditions and restrictions on paper supply in theU*nited States, the small supply of new American magazines provided by an american committee for men serving in the British Forces, and despatched by post (and later asmake-weight parcels by bombers), has been cut off. The L7nited States Forces here havebeen similarly affected.11. It will be seen, therefore, that supplies of books and magazines from the public in this country and from America are running at the moment at an unsatisfactory low level and it is likely, in the nature of things, that these supplies will diminish in thefuture rather than increase. Shortage of paper and other restrictions on output makeit equally difficult to satisfy the requirements of the Services by purchase from thetrade. At present the Services Central Book Depot can secure about 50,000 cheappaper-backed books from the trade each month, but, quite apart from purchases whichthe Book Depot desire to make out of their own funds, they have at.present outstandingfrom units or Commands at home and abroad orders for a total of 500,000 paper-backed books which they are unable to fulfil. As regards more expensive boundbooks, 20,000 a quarter is the maximum number which the Book Depot are able toobtain from the trade.12. It will be remembered that I mentioned in paragraph 3 (c) of W.P.(42)468that the War Office had received from the Ministry of Supply the offer of a specialallotment of 100 tons of paper to be made available for the book and magazine tradeson the condition that it was solely used for the export of books and magazines to
overseas forces. Books made from this special allotment of paper are now becoming available and they will undoubtedly help to ease the situation tor a short time. It isanticipated, however, that the total quantity ol books made available by this meanswill have been distributed before the end of May.13. The position as regards magazines and periodicals, which are even morepopular with the Forces than books, is similarly affected by the paper shortage andother restrictions, and the Services Central Book Depot consider that, proportionateiyto the demand, the position as regards magazines and periodicals is worse than is thecase with books.14. In this connection reference should be made to the monthly &quot; United ServicesMagazine &apos;&apos;, and the weekly paper &apos;&apos; Blighty &apos;&apos;. Both these periodicals are at presentdistributed free to the Forces through official channels. Apart from this, these papershave no official sanction, and their contents are in no way inspired by the Government.They are run as commercial ventures, and pay their way by their advertisements, thevalue of which is no doubt largely due to the distribution of the publications throughofficial channels. The circulation of the former has always been small, and has variedbetween 2,000 and 500 copies a month. The latter plays a more important part in providing reading matter for the Forces: its weekly circulation in 1940 was 67,000copies; in 1041, 48,000 copies; and in 1942, 36,000 copies.15. The United Services Review has been adversely criticised in the House, and theperson primarily responsible for its production has recently been convicted in the Courts forcarrying on the publication while an undischarged bankrupt. I have therefore decided to with-draw from it the privilege of free distribution to the Forces through official channels which it hashitherto enjoyed. f am at present considering whether &quot; Blighty&quot; should continue to enjoy this privilege, though this is a different case, both because there have been no courtproceedings in connection with the paper and also because I should be unwilling to deprive the troops of a magazine issued to them in fairly substantial numbers, and though of littleliterary merit, popular with them, unless some compensatory issue can be made.16. It therefore appears necessary to consider what special measures are needed to meetthe requirements of the Forces for books and magazines. On the one hand the demand islikely to increase rather than diminish as the offensive develops and further Forces proceedoverseas; on the other hand it seems clear that, with the passage of time, supplies from thepublic and the trade will continue to diminish, although as regards the trade the problem couldbe met by an additional allotment of paper for the production of books and magazines forthe Forces.17. In my submission the time has now come when the situation should be met by(a) the issue of a weekly magazine for the Army and (b) the allotment of a quantity of paper to the trade for the production of books and periodicals for the Forces.iS. As to (a) the Army Council approved as long ago as July last tire proposal that theArmy should have a paper of its own, but, owing to the then situation in the Middle East, itwas decided to await a more propitious moment for putting forward the idea. At the end&quot; ofthe year I discussed the proposal with the Prime Minister, who thought it a good idea,provided that no physically fit males were employed on the publication. But difficulties were raised in connection with the provision of the paper required.19. The proposed magazine would be of about 16 pages, demy-octavo, and copiouslyillustrated. Politics would be completely excluded and no advertisements accepted.It would be distributed officially through the N.A.A.F.I. at 2d. a copy; and later a wider distribution to isolated troops would be arranged by postal subscription. It would circulate both at home and abroad. About 250,000 copies would be printed weekly,consuming 10 tons of paper. At the price of 2d., the paper would begin to pay itsexpenses when it reached a sale of 180,000 copies, but I should be prepared to see itrun for a short time at a loss, if necessary.20. Visits to the troops have generally shown that the soldier has a real appetitefor well-presented information and discussion about the war its aims, conduct, strategy and incidents. Recent information shows that, even in the Army at home, nearly50 per cent, do not see a paper. The proposed magazine should do much to meet thepresent want: it would also be a powerful aid to morale. It would cover such matters as the science of soldiering; progress reports on the development of war on all fronts;narratives of personal initiative and gallantry; explanations of how the Army is runin its several departments; useful information about the enemy, and his mentality anddevices; notes on specially valuable articles from newspapers which the soldier rarelysees; the application of science in war, e.g., medical and industrial; articles about theRoyal Navy and the Royal Air Force, etc. It is interesting to note that the american army has both its own newspaper and a weekly magazine; both the Russian andGerman armies similarly have papers and magazines of their own.
(b43/181)   100   4/43   W.OP.   1348921. If the proposed magazine is approved I would withdraw the present privilegesof &quot; Blighty &quot;, since the new magazine would more than make up for the loss ot thatmagazine should that follow the withdrawal.22. As to (b) in paragraph 17, I would suggest that the arrangements made atthe end of last year, referred to in paragraph 12, should be continued and extended bythe allotment of 200 tons of paper quarterly for the rest of this year for the productionof literature for the Forces. The majority of this allotment would be used for paper-backed books, but some will be required for additional copies of magazines and periodicals. Arrangements to this end with the book and magazine trades can be madesatisfactorily by the Services Central Book Depot in the same way as they were madefor dealing with the allotment of 100 tons of paper in December, 1942. It is notirrelevant that the Services Central Book Depot return to the Ministry of Supply forsalvage purposes about 400 tons of paper annually from reading matter received bythem from the public which is unsuitable for the Services.23. In conclusion, therefore, I invite the War Cabinet to agree that:  .(a) an allotment of  520 tons of paper annually should be sanctioned for use in thepublication of a weekly Army magazine ;(b) an allotment of 600 tons of paper, at the rate of 200 tons a quarter, should be made during the rest of 1943 for the production by the trade of books and magazinesfor the Forces.P. J. G.The War Office,x8th April, 1943.
