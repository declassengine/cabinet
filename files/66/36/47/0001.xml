SUBVERSIVE ATTEMPTS ON THE LOYALTY OF THE indian army.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I FEEL it my duty to bring to notice that serious attempts are beingmade, both from within and outside India, to subvert the loyalty of the indian army, and to warn my colleagues of the clanger inherent in these attempts. Whatfollows is, however, a warning of possible dangers, and not a statement of any-bad situation which has actually arisen.2. For some months past secret reports have shown that the Japanese havehad some success in forming from Indian Prisoners of War in their hands anddisloyal Indian civilians resident in Far Eastern countries, an &quot; Indian NationalArmy &quot; (I.N.A.), and are giving full scope to the activities of the Indian Indepen-dence League (I.I.L.) centred round certain well-known political absconders from india, who for many years have found refuge and support in Japan or elsewhere.Subversive organisations in India which aim at seducing the Indian Armyfrom its traditional loyalty have existed for many years, but recent reports showthat the efforts of such organisations are being intensified. It is no doubt the aim of both the I.N.A. and the I.I.L. to make effective contact with these organisations.3. I have recently received from the Government of India papers, compiledby the General Staff at General Headquarters, Delhi, which, on the one hand,afford evidence of the nature and extent of the efforts of both the Japanese andthe Congress-inspired elements in India to subvert the loyalty of the indian army, and on the other point to numerous reasons why that Army as at present constituted is liable to be susceptible to such efforts.4. The General Staffs papers are based on the statements of escaped IndianPrisoners of War, on enemy leaflets and, in the case of subversive elements inIndia, on documents which have come into the General Staffs possession, as wellas on other reports from military and other intelligence sources.Beyond stating that the above activities are assisted by German propaganda,I do not propose to go, in this memorandum, into further details about these activities.   They exist.5. I wish rather to draw7 attention to some of the reasons why the indian army of to-day should be susceptible to such insidious influences, in spite of themagnificent record of that Army in this war up to the present.Firstly, the Indian Army has been expanded from a strength of 180,000 in1939 to nearly 2 million.  This has involved : (a) The exhaustion of the man-power of the bulk of the pre-war militaryclasses with their long tradition of military service and loyalty to the! Crown. ,1Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.MOST SECRET. Copy No. 26.W.P.

(b) Recruitment from many classes which were not enlisted in the Armybefore the war, and thus have not the traditional military qualitiesand loyalty of the pre-war martial classes. The recruitment fromthese classes is of necessity less closely selective of the individual than was that of the pre-war army.(?) The granting to a large number of Indians of emergency commissions inthe Indian Land Forces. Many of these officers are, not unnaturally,much more politically minded than the pre-war Indian commissionedofficer who entered the Army to make it his professional career. (See,in this connection, Thirdly.)(d) The promotion to Viceroy&apos;s Commissioned Officer of many non-commis-sioned officers who lack the experience and stability required of aViceroy&apos;s Commissioned Officer by pre-war standards.(?) The appointment of large numbers of emergency commissioned british officers with little experience and knowledge of the Indian soldier or his language, and to whom, therefore, the sepoy does not look withthe same confidence and faith as to the regular regimental officer.Secondly, the economic situation.   This factor operates in two ways : (a) The great increase in the cost of living has been a potent recruitingagent. Many men have been driven by force of economic circumstances to join the colours solely for the pay and material benefits the Armyoffers and in hopes of receiving training, ij.g.. in motor driving, whichwill benefit them in civil life after the war.The pre-war Indian Army was, of course, a mercenary army inso far as the men were volunteers, seeking a means of livelihood, notconscripts; but it was a professional army of men who chose the profession of arms as good in itself and were imbued, as part of theirprofessional instinct, with a devotion to their regiment and to theSirkar. A considerable proportion of the present Army are mercenaryin a lower sense; they are in it for what they can get, and notactuated, at any rate when they join, by devotion to a distant throneor by any sentiment of loyalty to &quot; the colours &quot; or by any instinctive&quot; esprit de corps &quot; or by hatred of the enemy.(b) The general cost of living fills the soldier with a constant anxiety as tothe welfare of the family he has left behind in the face of the same difficulties that drove him into the Armv. Unless he can remit enough of his pay to make his family secure, visits on leave do not relieve thisanxiety.Thirdly. Proposals for changes in the political constitution of India and consequent uncertainty regarding the position of the Indian Army under any newconstitution has raised, even in the minds of pre-war soldiers, doubts whetherthe British Raj is worth serving for anything but what it pays in cash and kind.The future of the soldier&apos;s own community, and the safety of his home and familyin a country which may, possibly, he fears, be controlled by men of a community he regards as hostile, are matters which, especially so long as he is not actuallycampaigning, cause him more concern than the defeat of the Axis Powers. Hisdoubts are not diminished if his officers include Indians who look forward,honestly enough, to the day when India will be independent of the British Raj.Fourthly. The ineffectiveness of our own propaganda in coping with theexcellent propaganda of the Japanese (which exploits to the full the foregoingfactors).Fifthly. The fact that the Indian soldiers in Japanese hands are those whohave seen the British soldier defeated by the Asiatic Japanese in Burma andAlalaya. The knowledge of such defeats is widespread in the Army. The Indiansoldier&apos;s belief in the power of Britain has been shaken.Sixthly. The declining influence of the civilian officer, I.OS., Police, andothers, in the districts from which recruits are drawn. This process has been going on for many years, due partly to centralisation, involving the more frequentintervention of the &quot; Secretariat &quot; or of the M.L.A., and the over-ruling of thedistrict officer and diminution of his local authority: partly to Indianisation;for, by and large, the British officer tends to have more weight with the peasant-soldier class than his Indian confrere; and partly this is a recent factor thewithdrawal from the districts of the most capable officers. British or Indian, to fill important war-time posts either in the Provincial Governments or in theCentral organisation for which the peace-time cadre (by which the extra burdenhas to be borne) made no provision.
0. Information so far received has referred almost entirely to the indian army, but the threat applies equally to the Royal Indian Navy and the Indian&apos;Air Force.7. There are no signs yet that the attacks, external and internal, have met with anything but limited success. (It is known that a number of Indian soldierswho have joined the Indian National Army in Japanese-occupied territory havedone so with a view to effecting their escape or to obtain better food and conditions.But the danger exists and must lie faced and all possible steps taken here, as wellas in India, to defeat it. The Commander-in-Ghief in India is fully alive to theposition and is taking active preventive measures to combat it.)I am examining what else can be done. One possibility, even though it maytend in the direction of increasing inflation, might be found in a further increaseof pay. I will go into that and, in consultation with the Indian authorities,into other possibilities.A measure which to my mind would be worth careful examination is theestablishment of an officer of high calibre, whose particular functions it wouldbe to study the causes of the malaise of the Indian Army and, so far as possible,counter it an Inspector-General of all the Forces in India (other than UnitedStates or other Allied forces). I have the impression that neither the Commander-in-Chief, with the additional burden of preparing for the main campaign in the fast and controlling operations already in progress, nor the Deputy Commander-in-Chief tied as he must be in that capacity to General Headquarters, can devotethe time to the constant touring and close study of units over the vast area ofIndia plus Ceylon which is required to watch over and counteract the dangers to morale.One thing, however, is, I think, clear. It would be dangerous to contemplate any further expansion of the Indian Army, and wise to concentrate on keepingestablishments up to standard and, so far as possible, weeding out unstableelements and replacing them by more reliable.One final point; it is of the utmost importance that full weight should begiven to the effect of any announcements and proposals regarding India&apos;s politicalfuture upon the Indian personnel of India&apos;s fighting services. It is on thispersonnel that we have been and are to so large an extent dependent for the prosecution of the war. particularly against Japan, and their outlook will be of vital importance in the difficult situation when Indians, in the fulfilment of the promise made by His Majesty&apos;s Government, set themselves to devise their ownfuture Constitution.8.   Field-Marshal Wavell has seen this paper and concurs in its terms.L. S. A.India Office, May 10. 1943.
