THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT   C&apos; g 1*&quot;tinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1943./(o &apos;62SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 160.April 17, 1943.WAR CABINET.SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL EXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.fTHE Lord Presidents Committee have asked me* to bring to the urgentattention of the War Cabinet certain recent activities of the Select Committee on national Expenditure and of its sub-Committees.2. The War Cabinet will recall that in the Summer of last year they twicehad occasion to authorise Ministers to withhold from Sub-Committees of theSelect Committee on National Expenditure information for which they had asked, but which, in the view of the Government, was concerned with issues ofan operational or policy character and, therefore, fell outside the terms ofreference given to the Committee by the House of Commons.t In accordance,with this policy, the Ministry of Aircraft Production recently declined tocommunicate to the Sub-Committee for Production and Supply (B) under theChairmanship of Mr. Lewis Silkin, M.P., figures relating to the programme andrate of output of the Barracuda Fleet Air Arm Aircraft. Information sincereceived in the Department shows, however, that the Sub-Committee, through their Clerk, acting on the instructions of the Chairman, have tried tocircumvent this decision by seeking the same information from Ministry of aircraft Production contractors. Copies of letters addressed by the Clerk to two such firms are reproduced in the Appendix to this Memorandum.3. By seeking in this way to obtain information which it is government policy to withhold, the Sub-Committee have placed both the Minister of aircraft production and the Contractors concerned in a most embarrassing position.Moreover, it is highly undesirable that the Sub-Committee should use the prestige and privilege of the House of Commons as a lever to extract from firms engaged,on Government work information of a highly secret nature, such as would normally come into the possession only of a few persons who are not only bound by the Official Secrets Act, but also both accustomed and equipped to ensure thesecurity of secret documents.4. There is another aspect of the matter and one which, the Lord presidents committee are informed, is causing considerable concern among contractors. Itis that several members of the Select Committee and its Sub-Committees are connected with firms of a similar character to those whose affairs are in thisway being investigated by the Committee. It is anomalous that, whereasMinisters assuming office are obliged to sever their business connections, otherMembers of the House should, whilst using their position as Members of the SelectCommittee to make searching investigations into the affairs of businessCompanies, yet retain what may often be conflicting interests.5. There are other features of the Select Committee&apos;s activities which we-view with grave concern. They have demanded the attendance of named officials,often serving in comparatively subordinate positions, have cross-examined them,and enjoined upon them to communicate to none (not even their superior officers)the evidence which they have given. On at least one occasion the Committee havetaken evidence from a subordinate official without the knowledge of the Depart-ment concerned, and that evidence has subsequently been&apos;made the basis of a* L.P. (43) 26th Meeting, Minute 1.f YVM. (42) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 2, and 86th Conclusions, Minute 7.[25317] b
searching cross-examination of ins superiors. Again, the Committee haverecently asked to see a confidential report made to their Minister at the requestof the Ministry of Aircraft Product ion by two members of the Minister ofProduction&apos;s industrial Panel about the efficiency of General Aircraft, Ltd.. andhave based this request on the ground that their powers &quot; to send for persons andpapers &quot; entitle them to demand to see. a copy of this report.(i.   The Select Committee&apos;s terms of reference are To examine the current expenditure defrayed out of moneys providedby Parliament for the Defence Services, for Civil Defence, and for other services directly connected with the war. and to report what, if any, economiesconsistent with the execution of the policy decided by the Government may beeffected therein.&quot;Strictly speaking, therefore, the Committee should concern itself only with questions of econefny and avoidance of waste. I understand, however, that inthe Summer of 1940 an indication was given to the Committee on behalf of theGovernment that they would be allowed a certain latitude in interpreting their terms of reference. This was. however, done on the assunfption that theCommittee would conceive their position as being that of an ally of the Govern-ment in promoting the National war effort during these times of emergency. Itis clear, however, that this is no longer the Committee&apos;s purpose and that they areinterpreting their functions in such a way as to impede the carrying out ofGovernment policy, and, indeed, in certain respects to usurp the policy-makingfunctions of executive government. Finally, their actions are clearly calculated to impair those relations of trust and loyalty between the Minister and senior officials on the one hand and between Senior and Junior Officials on the other,which are the corner-stone of efficient administration.7. If further proof of the Committee&apos;s attitude is needed, 1 would recallthe fact that, as the War Cabinet were informed by Colonel Llewellin en the11th June. 1942,* the Committee, having about that time drawn a comparison inone of their reports between two factories engaged on aircraft production interms very unfavourable to one of the two. showed the greatest reluctance toinform the Minister of Aircraft Production which those two factories were, sothat he might be able to remedy matters. There are also certain passages in the documents reproduced as the Appendix to this Memorandum which show biasagainst the responsible Department,8. In these circumstances, the Lord Presidents Committee recommend tothe War Cabinet that the Chairman of the Select Committee should be informed,on behalf of the War Cabinet, that the Government consider it necessary to assurethemselves that in future this Committee and its Sub-Committees will confine their activities to matters falling) within their terms of reference and that, inparticular, they will not seek to deal with issues of an operational or policycharacter or to obtain figures regarding programmes and output of war materials.The Lord Presidents Committee further recommend that Sir John WardlawMilne be told that the specific authorisation of the Minister concerned will infuture be required before officials, members of the Services, or Governmentcontractors and their employees are called upon to give evidence or to communicatedocuments in regard to Government business.9. Action on the lines of the latter recommendation might perhaps be challenged on the grounds of the power &quot; to send for persons and papers.&quot; Inthe time available it has not been possible to find any definite statement in theauthorities regarding the exact significance of this phrase, about the precise scopeof which there seems to be some doubt. In any event, however, the lord presidents Committee submit that practices such as those referred to in thisEeport are so harmful that, if any doubt exists, it should be dispelled withoutdelay by a clear statement by the Government and, if necessary, by a Vote of theHouse of Commons.J.

Enclosure (b).Select Committee on National Expenditure.Note for Witnesses.1.   The -meetings of the Committee are strictly private.&apos;2. A note of the evidence is taken and it is not at present intended thatthe evidence so recorded should be published. The transcript of the note is notprinted and at the most only a few typescript copies are made. One of thesecopies is sent to the witness for correction and, return, the other copies remainin the custody of the Chairman of the Full Committee, the Chairman of theSub-Committee taking the evidence, and the Committee Office, where they maybe consulted by the members of the Committee but by no other person. All copiesare clearly marked secret or confidential.3. The transcript for correction by the witness will be sent direct to him,and on the face of this copy will be found a note asking him to mark any secretpassage with red pencil so as to avoid the disclosure of the facts in any publishedreport from the Committee. By the rules of the House the witness is not permitted to make any public use of this transcript of. his evidence, nor to makea copy of it nor, unless his evidence has been reported to the House to publishany statement which purports to set out any of the evidence given.4. During examination the witness may always ask that any particularanswer containing highly secret matter should not be taken down; but in viewof the above paragraphs it is very seldom necessary to take this precaution.5. A witness before a, Select Committee is protected by the privilege ofthe House and may speak with complete freedom,. If any witness is molested,threatened, or in any way interfered witli as the result of being summoned or having appeared before the Committee, or because of anything that it may be-surmised that he said, such molestation or interference constitutes a breach ofthe priviliges of the House and should at once be reported by him to the Clerkto the Committee,6. Memoranda or advance summaries of the evidence to be given by aprospective witness which are submitted at the direct request of a Select Com-mittee are on the same footing as the transcript of the oral evidence. That is tosay, unless and until these documents have been reported to the House, they cannotbe&apos;made public by any member of such Committee or by any other person. Thismeans that the author or authors of such a document cannot, therefore, withoutrisking an infringement of the privileges of the House, make public use of it insuch a form that it purports to be a document laid before a Select Committee.Where a document which has already been published, or has been prepared for publication or circulation, is presented to the Committee, this should be definitelystated.8. Wages.Have you any difficulties under this head ?9. Finance.(a) Are you satisfied with the method of price-fixing?(b) Are there any difficulties in regard to payments and financial approvals?10.
