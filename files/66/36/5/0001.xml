this document is the property of his britannic MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT . j Q ,sj^ printed for the War Cabinet.  April 1943.SECRET. , Copy No. 33W.P. (43) 155.   (Revise.)April 16, 1943.TO BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK  AND  key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecv of this document.WAR CABINET.CHURCH BELLS.Note ny the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.I see no reason why, outside the specially regulated areas, the church bellsshould not ring on Sundays, Good Fridays and other special days in the ordinarymanner to summon worshippers to church. I recommend that this permissionbe given in time for the Easter celebrations this year.2. Invasion has become far less likely than in 1940 owing to our greatpreponderance in the Air and the large Army and Home Guard we have well-armed at home.   Should it occur, it will take one of two forms : [a) A seaborne expedition which, if large, will certainly attract our priorattention, and, if small, will be engaged by our coast defences;or(b) By parachute descents inland.The scale of a parachute invasion cannot in the circumstances of 1943 or 1944be very large on account of the stringency of the enemy&apos;s aircraft supply. Inany case, the transport aircraft would be picked up by our radiolocationapparatus and engaged by night or day by our fighting aircraft. The certainty of this might indeed prove an effective deterrent on such enterprises. The risk,therefore, cannot be considered as very serious.3. The Chiefs of the Staff have stated that there will be no invasion thisyear (W.P. (42) 582), and in my covering note to the War Cabinet I added thatthe possibility of vicious raids could not be excluded (W.P. (42) 583).[25308]
4. Should a minor raid occur, any persons in the vicinity who may happen to notice it will inform His Majesty&apos;s nearest armed forces who, after havingreported the occurrence by telephone or dispatch rider to superior authority,will take the best steps open to engage the enemy by fire. It is difficult to see how the ringing of the church bells in any particular parish would expedite the aboveprocess. Nothing could prevent the state of affairs from becoming rapidly known in the district, when all members of the various services would proceed to executetheir prepared and approved plans. There is in my opinion no danger that theannouncement that ringing the church bells will no longer play a part in ourprecautions against invasion, would discourage our Home Guard or induce a degree of slothful inertia among the regular forces.5.   The Chiefs of the Staff concur.W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,April 16, 1943.
