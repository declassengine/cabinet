I. GENERAL SURVEY.1. The End of the Stage of Expansion. The last six months of 1942 formedan important turning point in the history of our war production. Four separatelines of development, each of great significance, have reached completion duringthe period. Fii;st, we reached the end. of the stage of expansion and beforethe end of the year had allocated what we must regard as our final reserves ofman-power. Second, we had, by the end of the year, come very near to completing the initial equipment of the army. Third, and partly as a consequence of this,we have drastically reorganised, our plans for home production. Fourth, wehave set finally on a firm basis the co-ordination of our own programmes withthose of the United States and of the Empire.2. The approaching end of the period of expansion showed itself in a slower rate of growth of output. In the first half of 1942, munitions output was stillgrowing rapidly; in the second half, the rate of growth was considerably less. TheMinistry of Supply index of production of all warlike stores, in the first quarter,was 50 per cent, higher than the average of 1941; and in the second quarter 78per cent, higher. It rose in the third quarter only to 81 per cent. and. in the fourthto 96 per cent, above the average of 1941. The Ministry of Aircraft Productiontotal of structure weight of new aircraft, which in the first quarter was 26 percent, higher than the average of 1941 and in the second quarter 49 per cent, higher,showed a similar halt, and in the third quarter rose only to 63 per cent, and in thefourth to 74 per cent.3. During the third quarter this halt in expansion was to some extent the inevitable consequence of the holidays concentrated into July and. August. Butneither in 1940 nor in 1941 had there been any comparable retrocession. Andthe main explanation of the slow expansion of the later months of the yearclearly lies deeper in the causes suggested above.4. At the beginning of July we had already about 4 millions engaged on work in munitions industries for the three Supply Departments, as comparedwith about 1\ millions at the end of 1940. By the end of last year the figure had risen to nearly 4^ millions. At the peak the total will not greatly exceed4^ millions.5. Until this year, it had been possible, to make the requirements of thethree Services the starting point and to frame our policy in regard to man-powerand to civilian consumption to meet, so far as other limits permitted, their requirements. The limits had in the main been set by factory space, by machine tools and by productive capacity generally.6. In the course of 1942 the limits on our production programmes have beenreversed.. By the middle of this year the programme of construction of royal ordnance Factories was virtually complete. The enlarged aircraft programme had entailed a considerable amount of added factory space, but by the end of theyear this too was approaching completion. The limits of factory capacity nowaffect only a small number of particular products required to balance programmes.&apos;7. Similarly the immediate limit set by machine tools has become vastly less important. Certain tools (many of them imported) are still urgently needed forthe new aircraft programme. Changes of design or of the relative output ofdifferent weapons will continue to involve demands for special tools, and to an even greater extent for jigs and fixtures. And the provision of these will necessarily impose limits on the adaptability of our production. But to a farless extent than hitherto does this represent the ultimate limiting factor on ouroutout.8.**With these two short-term limits less generally effective, we are now ablefinally to expand, production until we reach the ultimate limits set by our man-power and our available materials.9. Survey of our Productive Resources. The survey of our productive resources started from the Ministry of Labour&apos;s Man-power Survey completed in September. As an outcome of that Survey the Cabinet determined allocations of the total man-power in the munitions industries to be received by the threeSupply Departments before the end of 1943, which, in aggregate, reduced theirprospective intake from the 937,000 estimated to be needed to achieve their then existing programmes to a figure of 536,000.[25214] B 2    .
10. At the time that these man-power adjustments were made there was good reason to expect that our raw material supplies, though obviously tight,would be sufficient to match the curtailed programmes. In the event several causesconspired to make the raw material situation rather more difficult. The shipping-required for the North African campaign was returned rather less quickly than had been hoped to its normal employments. The temporary shortage of escortsaffected the normal operation of convoys. Rather heavier shipping losses reduced the actual imports both then and subsequently. The United States proved unableto provide quick assistance to our import programme. In total it became plain that the raw material situation, at least to the middle of the year, was in dangerof involving us in greater reductions of programme than had been planned on other grounds.11. During the four months November-February, our net consumption of imported materials has been 4-1 million tons, of which only 2-4 million tons, or59 per cent., has been met by imports, and the remaining 41 per cent, has been drawn from stocks. The net consumption of imported materials in the whole ofthe first quarter of 1943 has been about 3-2 million tons, and that for later-quarters had been planned on a rather higher scale. The quarterly imports ofraw materials, on a slightly conservative estimate, may be put at about 3-0 million tons. Thus a considerable saving is necessary if we are to maintain presentstocks without any attempt to rebuild them. A survey of the possibilitiesof such economies was undertaken some little time back, at the request of thePrime Minister. The report of Lord Portal and Sir Walter Lay ton showed thatit was possible to save some 200,000 tons of raw materials a month, withoutappreciably blunting the cutting edge of our military effort; this was largelymade possible by the reduced military requirements that will be discussed below.These economies are not yet effective and will go some considerable part of the wayto meet our present difficulties. But it will almost certainly be necessary to imposefurther economies, and it is unlikely that this can be clone without some reductionof our planned programmes.12. The increased importance of raw materials as a limiting factor hashad the effect of diverting attention from the limits likely to be imposed by man-power. Until the Minister of Labour reports to the Cabinet in two or threemonths&apos; time any full and comprehensive picture of the progress and outlookwith regard to labour supplies for the munitions industries is impossible. but such information as is available makes it clear that the urgency of planning all our production programmes so as to make the greatest economy of man-power is as great as it ever has been. The likelihood of any considerable surplus oflabour in the munitions industries is remote.13. The Revision of Requirements and Programmes. The need to adjustprogrammes has arisen in part only from limitations of our productive resources.The changing requirements of the Services have been fully as important.14. By the end of 1942 the initial capital equipment of the army was, ingeneral, very near to completion. For some of the newer weapons there still remained substantial shortages. But, apart from these and a few other excep-tions, the point had been reached where production for the army must be brought down to the levels required for maintenance and for the replacement, where necessary, of obsolescent Aveapons by the most modern that we can provide.15. The reductions of programmes through the completion of initial equip-ment have been reinforced by reductions due to revised estimates of activity invarious theatres. The requirements based on the latest hypotheses are not yet available, but are likely to be below earlier figures. The most recent estimates hadalready reduced requirements in a number of cases by between a third and^a half.16. For a variety of reasons there is not likely to be a proportionate releaseof man-power from the Ministry of Supply, even if production is in futureconcentrated on to the most efficient units. In particular the initial equipment ismuch nearer to completion for the more highly mechanised weapons and types ofammunition than for those depending on less labour-saving methods.17. The aircraft programme has undergone drastic revision, and the new&quot; Realistic Programme &quot; almost certainly represents a better view of what theindustry is capable of producing. This revision has not immediately led to anychange in the man-power requirements for aircraft construction it representsindeed an attempt to judge the most that can be scoured with the man-powersupplies which the inolustry can hope to absorb.   But indirectly it has led to
certain substantial economies, since all the subsidiary programmes can now begeared more realistically to the main aircraft programme. This is likely to yield considerable economies not only in bombs, but also in guns and otherequipments.18. Steps have been taken to accelerate and increase the naval programme,mainly to meet the needs of the anti-submarine campaign for which escort vessels and aircraft carriers are urgently needed. The first step of raising the priority of Admiralty work had been taken in May. During the subsequent monthsspecial arrangements were made to provide labour for the Admiralty&apos;s most pressing requirements. In the allocation of man-power in November provision was made for an increase of some 111,000 in the labour employed on Admiraltyindustrial work between July 1942 and the end of 1943. This represented, how-ever, a cut of 75,000 on the increase forecast by the Admiralty. At the same time it is being sought to release suitable capacity from other programmes for thepre-fabrication of corvettes and for increased production of other bottleneck items in the Admiralty programmes.19. With these great changes it has been of the first importance to securethat the release of labour and resources by the contracting programmes shoulddovetail as perfectly as possible into the increased requirements for labour and capacity in the still expanding aircraft and naval programmes.20. This has been achieved in a variety of ways. There has been the normalclose touch between the three Departments, both directly and through themachinery of the Joint War Production Staff. The Minister of Supply hasarranged for some of the officials of the Ministry of Production, more particularly from the Regional Organisation, to be present at meetings in his Department atwhich programmes were adjusted. He lent to the Ministry of Production hisDirector-General of Statistics and Programmes to act temporarily as chairmanof a small Programme Revision Committee of four, including the chief officialsresponsible for programming in the Admiralty and in the Ministry of aircraft production and a representative of the Ministry of Labour. At the same timethe Regional Capacity Offices have been strengthened, and contractors and sub-contractors whose work is coming to an end have been encouraged to use them asa means of finding new outlets for their services.21. The Integration of United Kingdom with United States and EmpireProduction. The revision of our own programmes was closely interlocked withthe problem of co-ordinating them with American and Empire production.22. During the past few months the mobilisation and control of Americanproduction has reached the point where it is possible to say with much morecertainty what can and cannot be produced. In the earlier stages the conflict between various authorities and the attempts to regulate output by a system of priorities had led to great confusion. The system, though not yet perfect, isnow much improved, and the introduction of allocations, of scheduling and of acentralised control of man-power has made it appreciably more certain that production will accord with plans.23. At the same time the Combined Boards have now found their feet, andare likely to become increasingly effective as the American Government machineimproves. The Combined Production and Resources Board, in particular, willbecome more effective if, as seems likely, the quarrel between the United states military and civil production authorities is healed by agreement as to theirrespective fields of responsibility.24. The magnitude and importance of the aid that we are getting from theUnited States cannot be sufficiently stressed. A rough calculation suggests thatthe aid that we hope to get during this year from the United States alone is equivalent to over 1,500,000 British workers. We have, that is, working for usin the United States the equivalent of another entire Ministry of Supply orMinistry of Aircraft Production.25. There were two main issues on which some closer and more formal agreement with the United States was necessary at the time of my mission to washington. The first was shipping assistance; the second was provision in the revised United States production programmes for our vital requirements.26. In both respects we got all, or nearly all, that we could reasonably hope.The President, in his letter to the Prime Minister, promised that we would have&quot;enough dry Cargo tonnage out of the surplus shipbuilding to meet (our)
imports, the supply and maintenance of the armed forces, and other services essential to maintaining the&apos;war effort of the British commonwealth, to the extent that they cannot be transported by the fleet under British Control.&quot;27. There have been real difficulties, many of which we foresaw, in carryingthis into effect in the last month or two. Some of these were inevitable-theships simply were not there others are being smoothed out by the CombinedShipping Adjustment Board. But whatever the difficulties, it is now recognised,and we can plan on the basis that it is recognised, that the United states authorities have a responsibility to provide the help necessary for our minimumshipping programme, and that their shipbuilding programme will be framed withthis in mind.28. Our second objective adequate provision for our vital requirements inthe revised United States programmes sprang from the drastic revisions whichwere being made in the United States programmes. In the first few months afterPearl Harbour the United States Services had so inflated their demands that theywere vastly in excess of any manufacturing possibilities. But cuts in the ship-building were out of the question we were, indeed, pressing for increases. the revised aircraft targets had already been set. Thus the cuts were mainly concen-trated on the army programme, and in self-defence the United States army was inclined to argue that British requirements should be cut in the same proportion as their own.29. On the whole, the agreements that we succeeded in making were reason-ably satisfactory, though there were a few disappointments. We should then have liked to get more tanks, though the 12,000 that we were promised during&apos; thecourse of the year would go a long way towards meeting our needs as we then sawthem. There have been difficulties over the inclusion of certain items for whichwe could not at the time give firm requirements. We failed to get all the Fleet air arm aircraft that we desperately needed there are not enough to meet the combined needs of the two countries. We wanted substantially more transport aircraft than we got. But we did get a promise of 600 transport aircraft, 2.200aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm. and 6,400 aircraft of other combat types. Theseare a very substantial contribution to our needs.30. Thus, despite some disappointments, we have been able to carry ourown programme adjustments a stage further. We know that very substantial and important provisions have now been made for our needs in a set of thoroughlyrealistic American programmes. And if there is some doubt as to how far we candefinitely count on these in advance of actual assignment, we nevertheless knowbroadly where we stand.31. The same process of integration is being developed in the case of theEmpire programmes. Canada is now represented on the Washington Boards, and mutual adjustment of programmes is done either directly or through Washington.Negotiations with Australia and other Empire countries in the Eastern Group arein the main conducted directly by the Departments concerned. But it will be thetask of the Munitions Committee of the Commonwealth Supply Council in future to integrate the programming more effectively than has been possible hitherto.32. The Main Tasks for 1943.-The end of 1942 marked the close of thefirst phase in our task of munitions production. Hitherto we have been principally concerned with mass re-armament. That is now virtually completed. For thefuture our main tasks will be to keep ahead of the enemy in developing new weapons and bringing them into full production, so that we may add a technicalinitiative to the strategical initiative that we have won. This means that ourproductive organisation must be correspondingly flexible and adaptable.33. We shall have to plan in future to be more than ever economical of rawmaterials and of shipping space generally. This means increased emphasis on every way in which man-power can be used to save materials. We must devote,for example, more effort to repair and maintenance, less to making new equipment!We must see that this principle of saving materials governs the whole framing of our programmes and the whole disposition of our man-power.34. The limits of man-power available for the munitions industries will be increasingly stringent. If we are to achieve our enlarged programmes withoutproportionately enlarged labour supplies, we must do everything that is possibleto improve output per head.
35. . As we approach the ultimate limits of our output we shall find ourselvesmore and more frequently confronted by bottlenecks of one kind or another.We shall have to use every ingenuity to overcome these by more carefulprogressing of work and by cutting out all redundant demands.36. Finally, the limiting factor at every turn is shipping. Both we and theUnited States can produce immensely more than can possibly be shipped to thetheatres of war. In our own case it is no longer possible to ship both the whole of jthe finished munitions that are being made for us in North America and all the materials necessary to keep our own munitions industries operating at fullpressure. The supreme problem of 1943 is that of breaking down the bottleneckof shipping.   Everything else must, if necessary, be subordinated to that.O, L

The expansion of Ministry of Supply produc-tion since the outbreak of war, and its quarterly growth during 1942, is shown inthe table below : Ministry of Supply Index, of Production of all Warlike Stores.(September-December 1939 = 100.)1939.

Ministry of Supply output of all Warlike Stores was 75 per cent, greater in 1942 than in 1941, which had in turn been 80 per cent, greater than that of1940. There was, however, a distinct halt in the rate of expansion of output inthe middle of the year. This was not the result of reaching the peak output; therate of expansion during the year was two-thirds of the rate planned in programmes prepared in December 1941.39. While output expanded from end-1941 to end-1942 by nearly 50 percent., the number of operatives engaged on Ministry of Supply orders increased at the same time by just under one-third. The net quarterly addition to thenumber of operatives declined continuously over the whole year. The high rateof absorption of labour, which had been a feature of the period of rapid expan-sion, gave place to an intake which, by the third and fourth quarters, was littlemore than sufficient, to replace wastage : Net addition to ministry of Supplylabour force(operatives).September 6, 1941, to December 6, 1941 ......        136.000December 6, 1941, to March 7. 1942March 7. 1942. to June 6, 1942    ...June 6, 1942, to September 5. 1942September 5, 1942, to December 5, 194297.00073.00027.00027,00040.

The State of Equipment of the Army. The greatly increased volume ofproduction of 1942 brought the Army very much nearer to full equipment. By theend of the year the initial capital equipment of the units was, &quot;for a large range
of weapons, near to, or even above, completion, even when measured by the warestablishments and. entitlements based on the order of battle then operative. the subsequent changes in the order of battle have reduced total entitlements and havethus appreciably increased the ratio of our existing assets to entitlements,particularly in the case of ammunition.42. The new requirements and programmes are still under discussion, andno useful purpose would be served by presenting them in their present provisionalforms. In almost all cases the new programmes will be very substantially below those that were previously in force.(ii) INDIVIDUAL WEAPONS *43. Armoured Fighting Vehicles. Production of tanks was the mostdisappointing feature of Ministry of Supply output in the second half of 1942.After reaching the level of 2,200 per quarter in the second quarter, outputremained virtually unchanged in the third quarter and fell by 6 per cent, in thefourth quarter of the year; when only 2,073 were produced compared with fore-casts of 2,795 made in April and 2,068 made in October.44. Underlying these figures of total output is the delay in the volumeproduction of the new Cromwell type planned for the fourth quarter. Theoriginal forecast for this quarter was 300; in October the forecast was reducedto 35, and the actual production was 3. Technical difficulties with the transmission and suspensions have been responsible for this disorganisation ofproduction plans.   There has been a similar failure to start production of theHarry Hopkinslight tank.45. The number of tanks carrying the 6-pdr. has risen steadily and inNovember, for the first time, over 50 per cent, of all tanks produced were thusarmed.46. Production of armoured cars ran into difficulties with armour-plateand 37-mm. mountings in the fourth quarter. Carrier output, on the other hand,continued to break all records. Scout car production was considerably reduced inthe fourth quarter to increase the supplies of spares.Armoured Fighting Vehicles.A. 22 (Churchill)MatildaValentineCovenanter ...CrusaderCavalierCentaurCromwellTotal Tanks.......(Medium and Heavy)of which 6-pdr.and special vehicles ...Light TanksReworked A. 22(not included above)of which 6-pdr. ...       .......Armoured CarsScout Cars ...Carriers      ...     &quot;...Actual Production.Forecast.1942.II.III.IV.III.4993735343153852,1061644123774302,8974373974983205683703425792716382,22033216734155783993,7192,20070774149585744444,28642021860380749212,0731,077172208803343014,97349534053029575525J2,44084210457344204,115Note: Here and throughoutnil.= not available.IV.4002455401087305252,058190106582564,200* In all tables the forecasts for the third and fourth quarters of 1942 are those current atthe beginning of the quarter, and are taken from the Analysis of U.K. output dated 21st July,1942, and 7th November, 1942.T25214] c
47. Tank Weapons. For all these weapons except 4-inch Smoke-Dischargersproduction is ahead of usage and stocks are being accumulated; this is partly-due to the reduced output of tanks. A deficit in 2-inch Bomb-Throwers wasovertaken during the last quarter of 1942 with the aid of shipments from Canada.A deficiency of over 10,000 4-inch Smoke-Dischargers is being overhauled slowly.Actual Production.Tank Weapons.Forecast.1942.7-92 Besa.........15-mm.

Wheeled Vehicles. Production of wheeled vehicles has been held almoststationary since the second quarter of 1942. Nevertheless, output of tanktransporters and heavy lorries, of which there is a severe shortage, increased substantially in the United Kingdom. Production of tank transporters (largelyan American supply) in the last quarter was exceptionally high owing to the accumulation of materials at Albions&apos; due to the introduction of a modification.Wheeled Vehicles, War Office and Air Ministry only.

Gun Equipment. Gun production as a whole expanded by about 15 percent, in the second half of 1942, the expansion occurring entirely in the fourthquarter.50. The 1942 production of S.P. vehicles (included in special vehicles inthe A.F.V. table) was small. The Bofors and Oerlikon Crusaders were to havecommenced in the last quarter; a number of hulls for the latter were delivered.51. Output of 25-pdrs. has been ahead of forecast in spite of the utilisation of carriages for the 17-pdr. A.T. equipment. Medium and Heavy gun output was below forecast. Bofors production expanded considerably and exceededforecasts, but 3-7-inch A.A. gun production showed no change except for a shiftfrom static to mobile equipments. Some static capacity, however, reverted to theAdmiralty. Supplies of heavy A.A. predictors are short because North Americansupplies do not match requirements.52. Expansion of anti-tank gun production was concentrated on the 6-pdr.and the new 3-inch 17-pdr. The 6-pdr. was, however, slightly behindprogramme. The introduction of the 17-pdr. was accelerated by mounting150 guns on 25-pdr. carriages. Production of both equipments improved towardsthe end of the year.  It has been decided to tail off the 2-pdr. as rapidly as possible.

Small Arms and Mortars. The rapid increase in production of small arms was maintained in the third and fourth quarters, but in the last two months -total output, having reached its peak, remained stationary. Production of riflesin the fourth quarter was 2\ times that of the first, and output in the whole half-year was equal to forecast. Output of Sten guns expanded rapidly and reached&apos;almost 500,000 in the third quarter; it was lower in the fourth quarter, since,in view of the plentiful supply, the quality has been improved at the expense of current and future output. Bren production was on a much higher level in thesecond half of the year and exceeded forecasts by about 15 per cent. The JefferisProjector (P.I.A.T.), for which a requirement of 100,000 has been stated, was launched in the third quarter and is now coming into volume production; a level of24,000 a quarter is planned. On the other hand, output of mortars fell consider-ably, largely on account of redesigning of the baseplates and mountings of 3-inchand 4-2-inch mortars. &apos; Production of the A.T. Rifle was lower, but this weaponwill be largely replaced by the Jefferies Projector, and requirements&apos; willbe much reduced.Small Arms andMortars.Actual Production.Forecast.1942.II.III.IV.III.IV.2,in.

Gun Ammunition and Mortar Bombs (a) Empty Components. Output of empty components was well maintained in the second half of the year, except during the holiday period. The output ofshot was held up to some extent by shortage of shot steel, but the United States,although short herself, made available extra supplies. 2-pdr. A.P. and25-pdr. A.P. have been curtailed. The first capped 6-pdr. and 17-pdr., as well as3-7-inch, AA. A.P. shot have been produced during the half-year; but no capped2-pdr. shot was produced.Output of cartridge cases, which had been the main bottleneck, was good.[25214] c 2
(b) Explosives and Propellants. The high level of stocks of explosives andpropellants in relation to current needs was maintained. In the case of T.N.T.increased consumption led to an increased output and some temporary reductionof stocks.(c) Filling. Output of filled shell and mortar bombs has been maintained during the half-year. In the last quarter output of filled shell was expanded,while that of mortar bombs decreased. Notable increases in output occurred inmedium gun ammunition, in 6-pdr. A.P., 17-pdr. A.P., 25-pdr. A.P., Bofors H.E.and 2-inch U.P., while 25-pdr. H.E. and Smoke filling was reduced. Filling ofthe 17-pd.r. A.P. started in September and of the P.I.A.T. in November (thisammunition was for a time unfuzed owing to trouble in filling the fuze concerned).Charging of chemical shell was cut down in August to a steady level in order toavoid a more severe cut early in 1943. Charging of 4-2-inch mortar bombsincreased substantially in September, but since then has been limited by suppliesof tails, which have been under suspicion.Filled Gun ammunition and Mortar Bombs.(Thousands.)Actual Production.Forecast.1942.II.III.IV.III.IV.Field, 25-pdr.

Small Arms Ammunition. In total the output of Small arms ammunition increased rapidly in the second half of 1942. Output in december was about 50 per cent, greater than in June. Output was, in general, belowforecast made early in the year; this is attributed to the difficulties of expanding the labour force of the trade and agency factories.
56. Output of 20-mm. Oerlikon ammunition has expanded well, and produc-tion has been successfully transferred to the operationally important H.E.I. and h.E.T.T. types. The 9-mm. Sten ammunition was well above &quot;the latest forecast,but has not come forward as rapidly as had been hoped early in the year. Stenammunition output in the United Kingdom with overseas supplies in the last quarter of 1942 was 360 rounds for each new gun produced.-(-^-Small Arms Ammunition passedInspection.

The total United Nations output of military equipment during thesecond half of 1942, though below the forecasts of the 1st July, 1942, showed agreat increase over the quantities produced during the first half of the year.The output during July-December of armoured fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery, for example, shows an increase of one-half over the output ofthe previous six months, but is 30 per cent, below forecast; that of anti-aircraftequipments is nearly three times the output of the previous six months and lessthan 10 per cent, below forecast; that of artillery and anti-tank equipments is nearly double the output of the previous six months and again less than 10 percent, below forecast; that of small arms and infantry weapons shows an increaseof slightly more than one-fourth over the output of the previous six months, but was 40 per cent, below forecast.59. North A merica. The table shows the immense relative importance ofUnited States output and how much larger her contribution was in the second half of the year. In the latter period she produced 80 per cent, of the combinedtank and self-propelled artillery output as against 66 per cent, in the first halfof 1942; her share in the output of anti-aircraft equipments was 68 per cent, ascompared with a previous 39 per cent.; in artillery it was 57 per cent, ascompared with a forecasted 60 per cent, and a previous 52 per cent.; for small arms and infantry weapons it was 67 per cent, as compared with 55 per cent,previously.60. Recent adjustments of programmes made on the basis of revised require-ments of the United Nations and a revised estimate of available resources have resulted in a reduction of one-fourth in the American Army Supply Programme.At the same time an extensive revision of military equipment schedules has beenmade in order to bring production forecasts as a whole into balance with the newprogrammes. The new forecasts indicate a continued expansion to the middleof 1943 with a corresponding decrease in the second half.61. Canadian production is large in relation to population; her productionof armoured fighting vehicles other than tanks (i.&apos;e., carriers, armoured and scout
-cars), of anti-aircraft ammunition both of which arc about a fifth of combinedoutput and of small arms and small arms ammunition are of considerable importance.   Output is already close to the peak.62. Assignments of North A merican Production. The following table givesassignments from United States and &quot;Canadian (including United States financed)production of military equipment to the United Kingdom as compared with united Kingdom production for the last three quarters of 1942.

The reason for decrease in assignments of Tanks from United Statesproduction during the third and fourth quarters is that there were practically no assignments of the M3 Medium Tank, now totally out of production, in thethird quarter and none at all in the fourth. Assignments of the M4 MediumTank, which first came into production in the first quarter of 1942, increased substantially in the third and fourth quarters, rising from 278 in the second quarter to 798 in the third and to 956 in the fourth.64. No assignments of heavy tanks were made during 1942 as they failedto come into production before December 1942. It is not likely that any largeproduction of these will now be forthcoming.65. Self-propelled artillery was produced for the first time in 1942, anddue to technical problems of design and production, there was considerable delayas regards production of models other than the truck-mounted 37-mm. gun. Thisfailure is reflected in the relatively high assignments in the last six months ascompared to nothing before.66. Assignments of anti-aircraft equipments consisted of the 40-mm. Boforswhich was produced by the United States for the first time in 1942 and in large volume only during the last six months. Production in 1943 is estimated to be nearly double that of 1942. Only 736 are included for the United Kingdom inthe 1943 Army Supply Programme since our requirements will in the main bemet from home production. The United Kingdom is likely to receive the total1943 United States-financed Canadian production of 3-7-inch A.A. equipments-amounting to about 750..67. During the whole of 1942 assignments to the British group from UnitedStates Production have amounted to about 15 per cent, of British production(including Canada and the Eastern Group), or about 22 per cent, of the productionof the United Kingdom alone. The assignments of the last six months have represented a substantially larger proportion in each case. Assignments fromthe United States and Canada during the whole of 1942 amounted to 46&apos;per cent,of our total supplies (measured by value) of A.F.Vs., about 25 per cent, of ourguns and instruments, 27 per cent, of our small arms, 22 per cent, of our gun ammunition and 31 per cent, of our S.A.A.
68. Eastern Group. Production of military equipment in the eastern group countries has now reached the point where there is in some cases a surplusover and above requirements of the producer country since April 1942 SouthAfrica has been assigning to the United Kingdom approximately 300 3-inchMortars per month. Australia assigned in November to L.M.A.B. 50 3-7-inchA.A. Equipments; 50 25-pdr. Field Guns and 50 3-inch Mortars. An AustralianMunitions Assignment Board has accordingly been formed in Canberra and asimilar Board for India is in process of being formed.69. Total Assistance from North America and the Eastern Group. the magnitude of the aid in ground munitions that we are receiving from differentsources can be judged from the following estimates. In each case the UnitedKingdom production is taken as a basis of comparison. In 1942 such aid hasadded nearly a half to our own output of ground munitions.19%2.Per cent.United Kingdom Production ...       ...       ...       100Canada* ...       ...      ...      ...      ...       ...        24United States    ...       .........       ...        22Eastern Croup  ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 4Total...............      151* Including W.S.L. re-assigned to British.70. If such a calculation is extended to cover not only ground munitions, but all aid that we hope to receive in 1943, including aircraft and aircraft equipment,naval vessels, components for United Kingdom production and merchant vessels,the total from North America represents an addition of about two-fifths to ourprobable output over this whole field.C. AIRCRAFT.AIRFRA MES.71. Altogether, 23,671 aircraft were produced in 1942. Of these, 17,731were of operational type, which were 9 per cent, below the target of December1941 in numbers, but over 16 per cent, in terms of structure weight, on accountof the short-fall of one-third on heavy bombers. The only other serious setbackwas on naval aircraft, of which three-quarters of the programme was realised.A surplus on medium bombers compensated a 30 per cent, deficit on light bombers.Class of Aircraft.Heavy Bombers (-1- York)Medium Bombers ...Light BombersFightersG.R. ...        ........NavalTrainers, etc.Total: in Numbers...Total: in Terms of Structure Weight(million pounds)1942.		1943.

In 1942 the industry added, on the average, 425,000 lbs. structureweight to its output each month, which is just about double the mean rate of expansion from the beginning of the war to December 1941, and correspondsclosely with the further growth now officially forecast for 1943. The rate requiredto meet the December 1941 target, as amended, was above 600,000 lbs. increaseper month, and was clearly beyond the capacity of the industry, althoughshortages of labour have undoubtedly been the limiting factor in some cases.[25214]
73. I ne many new types brought into production in 1942 have all takenlonger than expected to get under way, and in some cases have suffered serioustechnical difficulties. This has been most marked in the F.A.A. types Firebrand (since cancelled). Firefly and Barracuda; fortunately, the Seafire, theSpitfire modified for carrier operation, has come out in good numbers, and thefolding-wing version is due to appear this summer. No important type-changes are scheduled for 1943. apart from the introduction of the Tempest version ofthe Typhoon, and two new fighters in experimental numbers (the pressure cabinWelkin and the jet propulsion Meteor); the Walrus will give place to the SeaOtter; the York transport version of the Lancaster will come in, and theBuckingham bomber is due at the end of the year. And the Beaufort may bereplaced by the torpedo version of the Bcaufighter.74. Minor amendments were made throughout 1942 in the target adoptedin December 1941, but on tin; 1st January, 1943, the entire programme wasradically revised downwards (15 per cent, by structure weight for .1943) in orderto firing it into line with the clearly marked trend of expansion, and to providea realisable forecast on which Air Ministry and FA.A. plans and provisioningcould be based. All the water has been squeezed out of the programmes, amiallowance has even been made for irregularity of deliveries to be expected as aresult of weather and holidays. Indeed, there is little doubt that the process&quot;hasbeen carried too far in some cases the Lancaster is certain, and the Halifaxlikely, to exceed its programme (deliveries were 17 per cent, and 12 per cent,above programme to the end of February) and it is perhaps unfortunate thaiit was not found possible to make the cuts upon unsatisfactory types and concentrate future expansion upon the best machines, the Lancaster. Mosquitoand Spitfire. Nor is it clear why the Stirling must be expanded to a peak inOctober 60 per cent, above recent output, when it is to lie replaced by theLancaster &quot; at the earliest-possible date.&quot;75. The decision to exclude the unarmed Mosquito bomber is somewhatsurprising. And no dive-bomber or general purpose army support -type is included in the programme, all reliance for these being placed upon Hurricaneand Mosquito fighter-bombers, and 1,200&apos; dive-bombers due from America.Furthermore, no medium bomber except the Wellington (which will be usedprimarily for operational training and coastal units) is programmed, until theBuckingham comes in a year hence.76. Another unexpected feature of the revised Forecast is the reduction ofover 10 per cent, in the level of peak output. Although this might be associatedwith the recent man-power decision to set M.A.P.&apos;s labour ceiling (to be reached by January 1944) at 2.017.000 (in the munitions industries), 100,000 lower thanthe estimated requirement, such a big cut cannot be justified on these grounds,in view of the fact that no estimate of the peak labour force so far ahead could possibly be accurate within 50.000-100,000. It must be interpreted rather as ashrewd intuitive guess at the limits of the industry^ capacity, taking all factorsinto account, and putting more emphasis upon&apos;managerial resources than uponthe margin of green labour.77. Throughout the war spares for aircraft have lagged very badly behindrequirements increasingly so as more aircraft have been sent overseas.Strenuous efforts to remedy this are being made, and the revised Forecast allows for an overall average of 15 per cent, of all airframe capacity to be reserved forspares. Deliveries of spares, for certain types of aircraft through 1942, have nowbeen estimated in terms of &quot;equivalent aircraft,&quot; and when these figures areavailable for all types it will be possible to progress spares output as an integral part of airframe production.78. Over half of M.A.P.&apos;s output in 1942 was in the. heavy and mediumbomber category, and at peak in 1.944 the proportion will be two-thirds, or very nearly 30 per cent, of the total munitions production of the United Kingdom, interms of man-power. By then 75 per cent, of the total investment in bombers willbe in heavy types, and most of the mediums will be used for operational trainingor Coastal Command. It is therefore particularly interesting to examine theoutput of heavy bombers in terms of the bombing potential which they represent.For this purpose the operational results of night raids by Bomber Command in1942 may be used to indicate the life-load of each heavy bomber (i.e., the tons of bombs dropped by that type, divided by the number of that type lost on those
operations), although technical or tactical developments, (for example, a new lease of life given by a change of engine) may, of course, invalidate these coefficientsin the future.Type.

Although many of these aircraft will be expended on conversion and practice flying, mine-laying, and possibly overseas, the total bomb-load Valuesdo give a reasonable indication of our future potential, because some Wellingtons(and possibly Warwicks) will contribute to the total effort to a partially offsettingextent. As long as the front-line strength is expanding, however, the realisation of the life-load output of any period will be partly carried over into laterperiods for example, only a, third of the heavy bomber output in 1942 was actually expended in bombing operations, and only a third of the life-load of91,000 tons produced was, in fact, dropped during the year by heavy bombers,80. The exceptional performance of the Lancaster has led to a decision to turn over Stirling capacity to its production, although not until late in 1944. Itmay also be put in at Vickers to replace part of the Wellington output, and theoperationally unsatisfactory Warwick. On the other hand, it is hoped that thoHalifax can be sufficiently improved, by installation of the Hercules engine, to warrant its retention.[25214]

The operational aircraft delivered to the British by the United Statesduring 1942 represented one-quarter of our total supplies. While in some typessupplies exceeded the agreements, in others, such as the Baltimore light bomber,the Bermuda dive-bomber and particularly the Lightning twin-engined fighter,they were far below expectation. On the other hand, nearly three-quarters of ourlight bombers and all our limited transport supplies came from the United States.During 1943 it is hoped to treble the supply of transports and an increase of light bombers is promised.
82. The Lyttelton Agreement covers Naval Aircraft, which were not included in either of the 1942 agreements. A substantial number of torpedo bombers and up-to-date naval fighters appear on the list. The S.B. W. (Canadian-produced &quot; Helldiver &quot;) is the first dive-bomber to appear on F.A.A. lists. TheLiberator goes up to 398 for 1943, &quot; primarily to assist in meeting the anti-submarine requirements of the United Kingdom &quot; -and 437 reconnaissance flying boats (100 4-engine Coronados, 237 Catalinas and 100 Mariners) are also allocated for 1943.Class and Type.	1942 Agreements.	1942 Deliveries, (a)	1943 Agreement.Heavy Bomber-Fortress     B-17...

The greater proportion of heavy types in the United Kingdom, and the increasing proportion in both countries, makes the numerical totals understate theBritish share in the total, and the combined increase in 1043 over 1942-which ismore like 140 per cent, than 97 per cent.84. The balance of the two programmes between the various classes of operational aircraft is very different (in terms of structure weight) :  (a) Only 45 per cent, of United States output is heavy and medium bombers.as compared with two-thirds in the United Kingdom.(b) Fighters represent one-fifth of United Kingdom output, one-eighth ofUnited States.(c) While the F.A.A. get only 4 per cent, of United Kingdom output (6 percent, in 1944), 12 per cent, of United States output is carrier-typeaircraft, l.e., 90 per cent, of these types will lie produced in America,although their aircraft carrier expansion programme is scarcely morethan double the British.(d) The big American programme for transport aircraft (ll-1 per cent, in1943 and 10 per cent, in 1944) has no material counterpart in theUnited Kingdom. It largely compensates the higher United Kingdompercentage of bombers.GLIDERS.85. Of training types, the 990 Hotspurs ordered have all been delivered andthe precautionary order for 14 Hengists will be completed by mid-summer. Bythe end of 1942, 629 operational Horsas had been delivered, on an original orderof 2,400, which has now been reduced to 1,575 (706 this year and 240 in 1944).bringing it into line with a revised War Office requirement of 985 this year and645 in 1944, subject to review in June 1943. The heavier operational Hamilcarhas just begun to appear, 120 being scheduled for delivery by the end of this year,and the balance of the total order of 194 in 1944.A ERO ENGINES.Type.	1942 (Actual Deliveries).				1943 (Programme).				1.

AERO-ENGINES.86. Throughout 1942 aero-engine production was well up to programme,although Rolls-Royce types did&apos;not expand quite as rapidly as scheduled, owingto delays in the introduction of several new marks. Apart from further expansiondue on these types and on the Sabre, and the introduction of the Centaurus, theindustry is approaching its peak output, necessarily well in advance of theair frame programme, and it will not require any further expansion of capacity..The Sabre has suffered serious technical setbacks, and output has not kept pace with that of Typhoon air frames; it has been decided to drop a big expansion ofSabre capacity in view of its limited prospects for long-term development. the radical expansion of Merlin production in United States, and the consequent increase in our allocations, has relieved what otherwise might have been a seriousrelative shortage of Merlins. The remarkably successful installation of theHercules in the Halifax, on the other hand, may eventually reverse the balance in this respect. Although the ordinary Merlin (marks XX to 56) and the Herculeswill remain the standard and principal aero-engines, the more highly super-charged Merlin (marks 61 to 73) for Spitfires and Mosquitoes, and the more powerful new types Griffon 61, Sabre and Centaurus will henceforth become increasingly important.AIRCRAFT GUNS AND TURRETS.Type.	1042 (Actual Deliveries).				1943 (Programme).

Most of the 660 40-mm. anti-tank cannons produced up to the endof 1942 were installed in Hurricane II d&apos;s; and a recent 45 per cent, cut in the1943 programme (eliminating the unsatisfactory Rolls type) leaves 1.410 to beproduced in 1943, to bring it into line with requirements for the 690Hurricane II d&apos;s scheduled for equipment with them in the same period.88. Deliveries of 20-mm. guns during the last quarter of 1942 were onlyJ,- per cent, below programme, and output has now reached its peak of 13,950per quarter. Stocks of 20-mm. in hand at the end of 1942 were about five months&apos;supply, and the 1943 programme exceeds requirements by some 15,000. deliveries from United States during 1943 will be used as &quot;round sains.89. The Browning -303 programme of 1st August, 1942, has been cut by nearly one half to 79,550 for 1943. in view of the high level of stocks (93.000Jit the end of 1942).90. The programme for Vickers CO. has been increased by 23 per cent.,56 per cent, of the total is for ground use. Production equalled and even exceededprogramme in 1942.91. We have been receiving -5-inch guns for some time from UnitedStates. At the request of the FA.A. 200 Fulmars were fitted with them. Theultimate destination of our steadily increasing supplies has not yet been decided.They will not be installed on fighters, but a turret to accommodate them on bomber aircraft is now under development, as is one to take two 20-mm. cannons, the latter being farther advanced.92. Turret production was satisfactory comparison, with programmegives a misleading impression, because it is very much out of date, and is to be revised shortlv.

The bomb position lias been dominated by the problem of switchingH.E. production to more modern types with higher explosive content, reducingthe 1943 programme to a more reasonable global total, and increasing the outputof 4 lb. Incendiary bombs. Requirements have now been reduced enough to limitfilled United Kingdom production in 1943 to 288,000 long tons, which is28 per cent, less than the previous (empty) programme; and to cancel all allocationsfrom America, except for 4 lb. Incendiary. But H.E. supplies still exceedprospective expenditure by more than enough to build up necessary reserves of thenew types now coming into production, and a further reduction consequent uponthe revision of the aircraft programme may be expected. The Air Ministry has agreed to release 150,000 obsolete 500 G.P. bombs from its stock of 400.000, forrecovery of material.AIRCRAFT TORPEDOES:1942 (Actual Deliveries).			1943 (Programme).

Although at least three torpedoes should be produced for each torpedo-carrying aircraft, output in 1942 was only 1,878 torpedoes as compared with about 1,530 aircraft (including conversions), or 1-25 per aircraft, the programmes for 1943 are even farther out of balance, 3,581 torpedoes beingscheduled, and about 3,950 torpedo aircraft (including E.A.A. allocations from
United States) or -9 per aircraft. Production in the second half of 1942 was only9 pei1 cent, behind programme, hut instead of increasing planned output in 1943,the schedule has actually been reduced by 16  per cent., from 4,294 to 3,581.United Kingdom output has been handicapped by non-delivery of many important and not easily replaced components from America, and long-standing Britishorders for complete torpedoes show no prospect of being met, since the Americanshortage is at least as acute as our own.D.-NAVAL  CONSTRUCTION   AND  MERCHANT  SHIPBUILDING.GENERA L.95. During the second half of 1942 various steps were taken which havemade &quot;it possible to increase and accelerate the naval programmes. A higher priority had been given to Admiralty work in May. During the following monthsspecial steps were taken to transfer some 2,500 men needed to man existing yardsmore fully, while enquiry was made into further possibilities. Under theman-power decisions of November the Admiralty will secure an increase of about111,000 in its industrial labour, assuming, as is likely, that it bears the whole ofthe cut imposed by the Cabinet on its -industrial side. At the same time theAdmiralty has developed a plan for the prefabrication of corvettes which willconsiderably increase the effective capacity of the yards engaged in theirconstruction.96. The increase does not, however, imply that Admiralty work will infuture represent a higher proportion of our total war production. Of all workersin the munitions industries employed on work for the Supply Departments about21-5 per cent, were doing Admiralty work at July 1942. By the end of 1943 this figure will have fallen to 20-5 per cent., again assuming that the Admiralty bearsthe whole of its man-power cut on the industrial side.REVISION OF PROGRAMMES: AIRCRAFT CARRIERS.97. Intermediate Carriers. An initial proposal was made in August to expand the construction of Intermediate or Light Fleet Carriers (carryingordinarily 24-30 aircraft) from 4 to 13 at the expense of 4 cruisers. By stages thisproposal was subsequently modified so as to increase the number of IntermediateCarriers to a total of 16.98. Escort Carriers. At the same time there was an expansion of the plan of converting existing or new medium-sized merchant ships (mostly of about15.000 gross tons) into Escort Carriers, accommodating 20-30 aircraft. the activity was completed in October; the Pretoria Castle is due for completionin May, a further 3 Escort Carriers are to be converted from partially constructedmerchant shipping during the second half of 1943.99. Apart from our own construction of Escort Carriers, we may hope toreceive very considerable assistance from the United States. They had alreadycompleted before the end of 1942 17 conversions of merchant ships to EscortCarriers. They hope to complete a further 23 Escort Carriers during the first half of 1943, and 41 in the second half of the year. Of these, we have receivedassignment of a total of 33, of which 7 had already commissioned before the endof the year. These are in most cases rather smaller than, the United Kingdomconversions, and ordinarily carry about 20 aircraft.100. Merchant Aircraft Carriers. A project has been introduced, for the conversion of a number of dry cargo ships and tankers into Merchant aircraft carriers, capable of operating 3-4 aircraft while carrying their ordinary cargoes.It is hoped to complete 18 of these during 1943.101. There will thus be a very substantial increase in the air escort availabletowards the-&quot;end of the yesa\REVISIONS OF PROGRAMME: ESCORT VESSELS.102. There has also been a very considerable enlargement of the programmes of Corvettes and Frigates. The first effects of the increasedprogrammes will not, however, be felt until near the end of 1943. In the first part of this year there is a relatively bare period between the completion of theoriginal programme of (single-screw) Corvettes and the building up of theprogramme of (twin-screw) Frigates. It is now estimated that there will be15 Corvettes and 33 Frigates completed during 1943; of the total of 48 it is[25214] E
expected that 12 will be completed in the first half-year and 36 in the second half-year. In 1944 it is hoped to complete 56 Corvettes and 83 Frigates. Thisincensed programme involves the loss of some 76,000 cl.w. tons of merchantshipping in 1943 and 230,000 d.w. tons in 1944.103. The original United States programme provided for 19 DestroyerEscorts before the end of 1942, of which none were completed owing to delays in production. In the first six months of 1943 it is hoped that 68 will be completed,of which we should receive 9. During the Avhole of 1943 it is estimatedQ that281 Destroyer Escorts and 69 Frigates will be completed. In 1944 a further458 Destroyer Escorts are planned; there is at present no programme forFrigates beyond the end of 1943. At present output is effected by the very widevariations in design and construction. But steps are being taken to increasestandardisation and to shorten the period of construction by pre-fabrication and close attention to bottleneck components.104. Canada had adopted an ambitious programme under which she washoping to build 31 Frigates and 32 Corvettes during 1943. The combined production and Resources Board in Washington has lately reported an increaseof this programme to 42 Frigates and 42 Corvettes.105. The total of ocean-going convoy escorts available at the beginning of1943 was approximately 450 British and 65 American. The planned construction in 1943 of Destroyer Escorts, Frigates and Corvettes, as described above, amounts in total to 482 vessels, and represents a very substantial addition to our forces available for escort.NEW VESSELS LAID DOWN.106.

Completions during the second half of 1942. On the whole comple-tions have been well up to programme over the year. The capital ships were all completed according to forecast. Destroyers were slightly ahead of schedule:two more Fleet and Intermediate and two more &quot; Hunt &quot; Class Destroyers than had been expected were completed during the year. Corvettes and Sloops were well up to programme; the proportion of twin-screw corvettes is increasingsteadily.(l) British and U.S. forecasts of completions are those used for the Anglo-AmericanConsolidated Statement.

New Construction in United Kingdom. The total tonnage ofmerchant shipping completed in the United Kingdom in 1942 amounted to1.299.000 gross tons (1,813.000 deadweight tons). This was about 11 per cent,more than in 1941. The following table shows the actual completions in the fourquarters of 1942. and gives also the comparable forecasts for the last two quartersas well as those for the four quarters of 1943. It will be seen that completions in the second half of the year were some 15 per cent, higher than in the first six months, mainly as the result of a very high figure in the last quarter. this large figure is to some extent offset by an exceptionally low forecast for the first quarter of 1943.Merchant Vessels Completed Thousand G.R.T.(Thousand deadweight tons in brackets.)	1942:			1942.		1943.

It was not to beexpected that, even with increased volume of new construction, we should keepabreast of losses. The total tonnage on the British Register fell by some13 per cent, over the year. Most of this loss was concentrated on tankers, thetonnage of which has fallen by some 18 per cent.

115. There has been over the year a net gain of about 329,000 gross tonsof non-tanker shipping, and a net loss of about 1,016,000 gross tons of tankers.Tanker losses have represented about 33 per cent, of all losses, while the totalstock of tankers represents about 24 per cent, of all shipping tonnage. Therelative shortage of tankers is likely to persist for some time to come. Presentconstruction plans provide for a substantial increase, in new tankers, but even so the provision is on a relatively smaller scale than that for non-tanker shipping.This can be seen from the following table :  Losses and New Construction of Tanker and Non-Tanker Shipping.(Thousand G.R.T.)Period.

III.-PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES.A. FACTORY BUILDING.119. By the end of 1942 there were some 85,600 workers engaged in buildingfactories and storage space. This was 21.400 less than a year earlier. Thefigures are shown below :  Workers engaged on Building of Factories and Storage Capacity.December 1041. July 1042.

At the-beginning of the year there was still a considerable amount ofwork to be done in finishing the programme of R.O.F.&apos;s. By the middle of theyear this was approaching completion and by the end of the year the figure ofthose engaged on R.O.F.&apos;s was very small.121. The labour saved through the contraction of the R.O.F. work was largely absorbed during the first part of the.year by the new factories required to implement the enlarged Airfield Programme of December 1941. This require-ment rose up to the middle of the year, but had appreciably declined (as had been expected) before the end.122. In 1943 there arc not likely to be any comparable demands for factory building. There will be inevitable factory extensions to meet particular needs.The Admiralty may have certain requirements in connection with the expansionof their enlarged construction programmes. But in general factory building islikely to be on a substantially smaller scale.123. The problems of storage capacity are, however, becoming increasinglyacute, the more so as existing storage capacity is almost exhausted and, withthe initial equipment of the army completed, a larger proportion of production isdestined to build up reserves. An increased volume of storage capacity may,therefore, have to be built during the coming year.B.-MACHINE TOOLS.(i) MACHINE TOOLS.124. During the last half of 1942 the number of machine tools installed by united Kingdom users was 54,974, being substantially the same as that (54,846)installed in the first half of 1942. The contribution from United Kingdommachine-tool manufacturers increased, however, over the two periods, while that from imports fell off. Of total supplies (imports plus production) UnitedKingdom manufacturers furnished 77 per cent, in numbers of tools in the first sixmonths of 1942, but 87 per cent, in second six months.125. Imports, mainly from the United States, are, as far as possible, being restricted to those specialised types of tools for the production of which facilitiescannot be developed in this country. Reliance to a decreasing extent is placed upon United States supplies to meet unfulfilled United Kingdom requirements for standard tools.126. Exports were almost identical in volume in the two halves of 1942 and represented 6-2 per cent, of total supplies. Their destinations in the last sixmonths of 1942 are indicated by the following proportions (value basis) : Russia.43 per cent.; Middle East, 1-2 per cent.; Australia, 23 per cent.; India, 20.percent.; other countries, 12 - 8 per cent.

With the flattening during 1943 of production curves over a largerange of munitions, the rate of estimated requirements for machine tools of standard types has already tended to decline. Successive estimates, each covering the ensuing twelve-months^ period, compiled by Department and other users, showthat the estimates of Julv 1942 for the period July 1942 to June 1943 are amaximum and that those for the year 1943 are below those for the year 1942.Estimated Requirements for Machine Tools.Ministry of Supply...- Ministry of AircraftProductionAdmiralty   ...Machine Tool Control :Ass.

136. While the overall rate of increase in the United Kingdom production has not been as great as with machine-tools and small tools, certain items in this131. Assisted Schemes requirements are in respect of expansions to production capacity supported by Government finance. Independent demands are received direct from contractors. All these requirements are investigated byMachine Tool Control, who examine the utilisation of any existing machines andthe necessity for the further machines required. Present figures indicate thatthere will be a surplus of supplies over the total requirements in 1943 of some.300 tools. This balance is not, however, evenly spread over all types of tools,the supply-demand position for some of which will remain critical. In previous years large additional requirements to those estimated have been experienced.(ii) SMALL TOOLS (including Jigs, Measuring Instruments, &amp;c.).132. Requirements and utilisation of small tools follow fairly closely the movements in the level of munitions output. A switch between alternative types ofmunitions and alterations in design, while not necessarily affecting demands for machine tools, will call for further production of small tools. The increase in small tools output (which can practically only be measured in value) has accordingly been substantial :  (.t000&apos;s.)1941. 1942.July-Dec.

Unlike machine-tools, the reliance upon United States supplies for small tools is an increasing one, as the following values of United kingdom imports show :  1941 : Year        ............       1,800,0001942: January-June     .........       1,851,000July-December   .........       4,309,000Year        ............      6,160,000but even this increase falls short of requests and there are indications of greater difficulties in the future, through expansion of United States domestic require-ments. Every step is accordingly being taken to increase United kingdom production to minimise difficulties arising from a possible shortfall in UnitedStates supplies.134. Production of small tools is covered by some 600 manufacturers andtheir sub-contractors and although increase in total employment is slowing downmarkedly, a very substantial switch-over to female labour is taking place : PercentageFemales ofMales.

section constitute some of the greatest supply difficulties in the Machine ToolControl. The demand at the 31st December, 1942, for d.c. motors, 1 to 50 h.p.,represented, for example, an eleven months&apos; load on production capacity; forresistance welders a six months&apos; load; for pneumatic and electric power toolsseven and eight months&apos; load respectively.137. Requirements of industrial electrical equipment and of weldingmachines are met in large measure from United Kingdom production; forportable tools, present arrangements provide for supplies from United states to account for some 20 per cent, of United Kingdom requirements. steps are nevertheless being taken towards minimising our dependence for this equip-ment upon overseas sources.C. RAW MATERIALS.(i) UNITED KINGDOM IMPORT PROGRAMMES.138. Imports in 1942. Over the year 1942 we have achieved only22-9 million tons of imports against a programme of 26 million tons. Of the deficit 0-7 million tons have been borne by materials, the total import of whichwas 11-5 million tons; 1-7 million tons by food; and 0-7 million tons bymiscellaneous imports. Slightly more than half the year&apos;s total imports of rawmaterials (5,933,800 tons) arrived in the second half of the year. Of this amountno less than 3,483,200 tons were imported in the third quarter.139. Unfortunately, the relatively small deficit in totaktonnage of materialsimports over the year as a whole conceals more serious shortfalls in the twocritical groups, iron and steel and non-ferrous metals. Tonnage has been made up largely by means of relatively heavy imports of softwoods, cotton and wood-pulp. Of raw wool we have, owing to the strategic disposition of shipping,imported no less than 180 per cent, of the programme. We have also exceeded the programmes for sodium nitrate, pyrites, chrome ore and newsprint. Importsof iron ore and of manganese ore have been well maintained. The rubber programme was, of course, drawn up in the expectation of loss of Far Easternsupplies; but it is nevertheless gratifying that imports for the year represent108 per cent, of programme.140. The most important shortfalls of individual materials have occurred in steel, pig iron, bauxite, sulphur, phosphate rock, ferro-alloys, constructionalplywood, copper, tin and aluminium. The heavy incidence of the deficiencyon our more critical materials is evident. In the case of the last five materialsnamed, supply difficulties other than shipping have been instrumental in reducingimports, but steel and pig iron imports suffered particularly from the heavyshipping losses of October and November.141. Imports in 1943- Consumption of imports over the whole of 1943 isstill difficult to estimate, subject as it is to changes which have not yet been fullyworked out in military requirements and production programmes. provision was made in the original import programme of 27 million tons for imports of14 million tons of raw materials, which were then expected to be required to meet a net consumption of imported raw materials of about 7-7 million tons in thefirst six months, and of 7-9 million tons in the second half of the year.142. Partly because of the unexpectedly heavy and lasting demands of theNorth African expedition, partly because of delays in providing Americanshipping assistance on the full scale required to achieve the programme, importsof raw materials in the first half of 1943 are unlikely to be much, if at all, above5 million tons.143. The volume of destocking which this would imply was more than could be safely accepted, and, at the Prime Minister&apos;s request, an examinationwas made of the possibilities of effecting economies. A Report by Lord Portaland Sir Walter Layton showed that it should be possible to make economies whichwould reduce the consumption of the first half-year from about 7-7 million tons to about 6-5 million tons, without seriously impairing our effective war effort.The reduction could be achieved by severe cuts in the consumption programmes for certain materials, notably steel, softwoods and fertilisers. Earlier estimateshad assumed a total consumption of 6 - 2 million tons of finished steel in the period in question; this figure would, according to their proposals, be cut to 5 - 7 million tons.   In the case of softwoods, they would reduce total consumption from[25214] f 2
950,000 tons to 900,000 tons. As regards fertilisers, it is proposed that thereshould be no import of phosphate rock for fertilisers except in so far as this material can be brought back from North Africa in ships which will in any case be in that part of the world for strategic purposes. More recent information asregards current and prospective imports makes it clear that additional economieswill be necessary.(ii) STOCKS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.144. Stocks of all imported materials (excluding consumers&apos; stocks of steel)are estimated to have amounted to 9,938,000 tons at the end of December; totaldestocking of imported materials was 1-8 million tons during the year 1942. Inaddition, consumers&apos; stocks of steel are estimated to have declined by 400,000 tons during the year. Net consumption of imported materials, that is destocking plusimports, has therefore amounted to some 13-7 million tons in 1942. total consumption, which includes home production, was, of course, very much greater.145. Nearly two-thirds of the year&apos;s destocking of imported materialstook place in the first half of the year. Stocks of these materials fell by only610,000 tons in the second half of the year. There was a very heavy declinein the final quarter; but in the third quarter stocks of imported materialsactually rose by 305,000 tons, owing to the heavy concentration of imports,particularly of timber, in that quarter. Stocks of materials included in the monthly stocks statement presented to the Lord Presidents Committee but not covered by the Import Programme (materials, in other words, exclusively home produced) showed a similar difference in their movements over the two halves ofthe year, falling by 118,000 tons in the first half and rising by 289.000 in thesecond half. Here the chief explanation is the strongly seasonal consumptionof compound fertilisers; but stocks of home-produced iron ore also fell in the first,and rose in.the past, six months of the year.146. The general destocking in the second half of the year was spread overall types of materials save timber, fertilisers and paper-making materials. Therise in paper and paper-making materials was concentrated in wood-pulp and paper and board other than newsprint. Within the timber group only stocks ofsoftwood rose to any extent.147. Rubber stocks declined by 33 per cent, during the six months. Apartfrom this and the case of phosphate rock, the chief and most dangerous instances of destocking arose in the iron and steel and non-ferrous metals groups. Stocksof steel (apart from consumers&apos; stocks) fell by 153,000 tons; stocks of importediron ore fell by 21 per cent., of manganese ore by 31 per cent., of copper by 23 percent., and of bauxite by 36 per cent. Cause for anxiety was also provided by thehemps, hard and soft, stocks of which together fell by 38 per cent. Stocks ofall the following materials are not more than four weeks&apos; consumption above whatis regarded as a minimum : -Imported Iron Ore. Hardwoods.Manganese Ore. Constructional Plywood.Copper. Phosphate Rock.Bauxite.(iii) INDIVIDUAL MATERIALS.148. Steel. In 1942 production of steel in the United Kingdom was12-69 million long ingot tons, as compared with 12-26 million tons in 1941 and13-21 million tons in the record year 1939. The rate of output fluctuatedconsiderably over the year, running at an annual rate of 12 - 61 million tons in thelast half-year, and of 12-95 in the final quarter. (Output in July and Augustwas at the year&apos;s lowest&apos; level.) It is hoped that in 1943 production will againreach 13-0 million tons. Capacity for this level of production exists, althoughconversion to alloy steels is somewhat reducing the total.149. Imports of steel into the United Kingdom in 1942 totalled 2,087,000tons, of which 1,403,000 tons came in during the second half of the year; nearly a million tons of this in the third quarter. This compares with 3-0 million tonsof imports in 1941. During the year, stocks of steel, including consumers&apos; stocks,are estimated to have fallen by 884,000 tons.   Total consumption of steel in the
United Kingdom in 1942 amounted to 11-6 million long tons of finished steel.Of this total 0-4 million tons were drawn from consumers&apos; stocks, while deliveries to consumers amounted to 11-2 million tons. These were divided as followsbetween the chief user departments :-Table.Deliveries of Finished Steel, 1942.	1st Qr. Per Cent.	2nd Qr. Per Cent.	3rd Qr. Per Cent.	4th Qr. Per Cent.	Year.

Prospects for 1943 are as yet somewhat uncertain. In the final quarterof 1942 deliveries were running at an annual rate of 12-0 million tons of finished steel. At the end of December 1942 it was assumed that consumption in 1943would amount to 17-2 million ingot tons, equivalent to 12-0 million tons of finished steel : in other words, steel intake was believed to have reached its peakin the United Kingdom. Allocations for the first quarter of the year were actuallymade on this basis : 2-98 million tons were allocated, of which 100,000 tons wereto be drawn from consumers&apos; stocks. The revision of the Import Programmenecessitated by the shipping position made it necessary, however, to economisein steel, and the allocations were subsequently reduced.151. A provisional balance-sheet for steel supplies and consumption in thefirst half of 1943 may therefore be drawn up as follows : AllocationsUnited Kingdom ProductionDestockingImports ...152. The United States steel position, while difficult, is not critical. . Thechief pressure is on alloy steels, for which requirements are expanding faster than capacity, though a deficiency of carbon steel is expected in the first quarterof 1943. United States production of carbon steel remained at 75 million shortingot tons in 1942, a negligible increase over the 1941 figure. Alloy steel output,however, rose to 11 million short tons compared with 8 million in 1941; theincrease in total (carbon and alloy) steel production was thus about 4 per cent.,all concentrated in the alloy steels. In 1943 output of carbon steel is expectedto rise slightly to 79 million tons, and output of alloy steel to be 14 million tons.This, a total of 93 million short tons, represents a downwards revision on earlierestimates, and will not suffice to meet the expanding munitions programmesunless there is considerable diversion from the indirect military and essentialcivilian segment.   This segment still constituted 30 per cent, of total UnitedMillion Tons of finished SteelEquivalent.... o I4-6:::&apos;) -

Copper. Imports of copper into the United Kingdom in 1942 totalled453-5 thousand long tons, of which 209,100 tons came in as blister and244,400 tons as refined copper. Stocks of virgin copper fell by 40,000 tons duringthe year, and at the end of December were actually below what is regarded as a desirable working minimum. Since production in the United Kingdom is negligible, consumption of virgin copper in 1942 was about 480.000-490.000tons. Half the United Kingdom&apos;s copper consumption is for the productionof ammunition, ground, air and naval. Mid-1942 estimates of requirements forthe year ending the 31st June, 1943, now under revision, gave the followingproportions between uses; revisions now in process will diminish allocations of copper for certain uses, and thus affect these proportions :  Copper Requirements, July 1943-June 1943.Percentageof Total.Navy Ammunition      ....       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        other        .....................        7Merchant Marine   ...       ...       ... ...       ...      ... 1Air Aircraft    ...       ...       ...       ... ...       ...       ... other............. ......... 1Army Gun ammunition ...Small-arms ammunition (including air ammunition)Other        ...       ...     .......Plant construction  ...       ...       ...&quot;Non-military (including indirect military)-Electricity and cablesOther-       ...&quot;    ...321 Ait74-1 aTotal        ..................     100154. Supplies of copper to the United Kingdom depend on the total supplies and requirements of the United Nations and especially the United States; theyare now subject to very close scrutiny by the Combined Raw Materials Board.United States consumption (including exports) in the final quarter of 1942 was atan annual rate of 2-5 million long tons. Total supplies to the United States in1943 are not expected to exceed 2-3 million tons; so that consumption will haveto be cut in 1943. The whole United States copper position is dominated by theprogramme for substitution of steel for copper in cartridge cases and bulletjackets. If the programme is fulfilled, some 250,000 tons will be saved in theyear. Supplies for the year will then be not more than 4 per cent, short of requirements. If the programme were to fail completely there would be a deficit of some 350,000 long tons.155. In 1942, 20 per cent, of the United Kingdom&apos;s imports of copper came from Canada.   Unfortunately it has not been possible to expand Canadian
production, which ran at 294,400 long tons in 1941 and 278,300 tons in 1942,and is expected to remain at the 1942 level in 1943. Domestic consumption is increasing rapidly to keep pace with Canada&apos;s output of ammunition : totaldomestic consumption in 1941 was 106,300 tons, in 1942 was 133,700 tons, andin 1943 is expected to be 171,200 tons. Of the 1942 consumption, 77 per cent, was for direct military uses. It follows that the quantities available for export arediminishing.156. Rubber. The outstanding feature of the United Kingdom rubbersituation in 1942 has been the enforcement of consumption economies resultingfrom the loss of Far Eastern supplies.   This appears from the following table : Crude Rubber.(Long tons.)United Kingdom United KingdomConsumption.    Stocks at end of period.43,500 97,20032,650 98,00024,350 88,00019,220 73,10018,723 59,400...   (Estimated) 19,463(Estimated) 56,000...   (Allocated) 20,4941941 : 4th Quarter1942 : 1st quarter 2nd Quarter3rd quarter 4th Quarter1943 : 1st quarter 2nd quarter in addition, it was estimated that 2,000 tons would have to be drawn fromDepartmental stocks of tyres in the third quarter of 1942, 2,400 tons in the fourthquarter, 1,500 tons in the first quarter of 1943 and 1,600 tons in the second quarter.It is possible that consumption under licence has also been supplemented to someextent by drawing on undeclared consumers&apos; stocks. Making all such allowances,however, there is no doubt that consumption of rubber has now been restricted to apoint at which shortage of aero tyres, for instance, may affect the aircraft pro-gramme in 1943. Direct military uses accounted for about 65 per cent, of consumption in the last half of 1942. Two-thirds of all consumption of cruderubber is for tyres (including aero tyres), but a much lower proportion of reclaimedrubber is used for tyres. Reclaimed rubber has come under allocation only sincethe middle of the year : in the six months in question some 20,000 tons have beenconsumed.157. Imports of-rubber (including balata, latex and waste rubber) into theUnited Kingdom in 1942 amounted to 76,000 tons, of which only 13,000 tonscame in the second half of the year. The years consumption of 115,000 tons(crude and reclaimed) necessitated destocking of 38,000 tons of crude rubber, mostof which (29,000 tons) naturally took place in the last six months.158. Supplies of rubber available to the United Nations have been shortenough in 1942 to be subject to very strict budgeting. In the half-year endingDecember 1942, to meet total joint requirements amounting to nearly350,000 tons, imports from Ceylon, Africa, India and Latin America amountingin all only to some 70,000 tons were available; the rest of consumption had to bedrawn from stocks. No considerable increase in supplies from these sources canbe expected in 1943, .and since joint requirements are expected to expand toperhaps 370,000 tons in the second half of 1943 (firm figures are not yet available),the whole United Nations rubber situation depends on the American syntheticprogramme.159. Expectations of early results from this programme have recentlydeteriorated. Synthetic rubber competes for facilities both with high-octanefuel and with escort vessels, and the progi&apos;amme depends besides on the availability of adequate supplies of labour and materials. An output of260,000 tons in 1943 is, however, now regarded as fairly certain, but the great bulk of this production will fall in the latter part of the year. This will involverunning down United Nations stocks of crude rubber to a very critical minimum(possibly less than three months&apos; consumption) at the end of September, and theirdistribution between consuming countries, so that each may have enoughcrude rubber left to mix with the new synthetic, will be a matter of very niceadjustment.
160. Aluminium. The bulk of United Kingdom supplies of aluminium is derived from Canada. In 1942 imports (97 per cent, of which came from canada and the remainder from the United States) amounted to 141,000 long tons of virginaluminium, as compared with United Kingdom production from imported and home produced bauxite of some 47,000 tons. Shipping difficulties have gravelyaffected bauxite supplies both to Canada and to the United Kingdom during theyear. Canada relies entirely on bauxite from British Guiana, and, owing toU-boat activity in the Caribbean in the early part of the year, there were seriousdelays in imports from British Guiana to Canada, with consequent running down of stocks to a very low level. Canadian capacity for aluminium production hasexpanded enormously since 1940 : primary production in Canada rose from189.500 long tons in 1941 to 299.800 tons in 1942, and is expected to reach 453,600tons in 1943. Although Canadian domestic consumption is also expanding (from10.700 tons in 1941 to 15.200 tons in 1942 and an estimated 26,800 tons in 1943).the greater part of the increase will be available for export, chiefly to the UnitedKingdom and the United States.161. Bauxite for the United Kingdom is now being, or is about to be, drawn from British Guiana, Brazil, India and the Gold Coast. In addition, Irishbauxite is being mined at the rate of almost 150,000 tons per annum, representingsome 75,000 tons in terms of high-grade imported bauxite; but this is a wastingasset. It is the intention not to draw upon South American supplies any longer than is necessary, since these are required primarily for the North Americanindustries. During 1942. owing to the difficulties in the Caribbean and tounavoidable delays in the provision of loading facilities, the United Kingdomexperienced a serious shortage of bauxite imports, with the result that stocks fell to some 38.000 tons, or about 10 weeks&apos; consumption, at the end of the year. Theposition has improved somewhat in the early months of 1943.162. United Kingdom consumption of virgin aluminium (defined asdespatches to consumers) during 1942 amounted to 191,000 tons; this rate of consumption is expected to rise steadily during 1943, giving a total consumptionof 264.000 tons for the year. Nearly 90 per cent, of all virgin aluminium used isfor aircraft, and for this purpose only a limited use, amounting in all to about20 per cent, of the total, can be made of secondary metal. The virgin aluminiumrequirements are thus very closely related to the growth of the aircraft programme.&apos;163. Tin. Faced with the loss of Far Eastern supplies the United nations have been forced to take vigorous measures to curtail tin consumption in 1942.In the United Kingdom, for instance, domestic consumption amounted to some23,000 tons, compared with about 39.000 tons in 1941. In addition. 13,056 tons were exported from the United Kingdom in 1942; of this amount 9,000 tons went to the U.S.S.R. Imports of tin ore anrl concentrates during the year totalled44,000 tons, while domestic production in terms of metal content amounted to2.400 tons. Allowing for loss of weight in smelting, supplies over the. yearequalled consumption, and stocks remained practically unchanged. Cornishproduction fluctuated about the monthly average of 200 tons (metal content)throughout 1942.164. The international allocation of tin concentrates has to depend on thesmelting capacity of the United Kingdom and of the United States respectively.The combined Raw Materials Board has made allocations for 1943 which will allow British smelting capacity to work at about 30.000 tons per annum, aneconomical production rate. This roughly represents, moreover, United Kingdomrequirements for 1943. These requirements cover proposed shipments to Russiaat the rate of 750 tons per month until the end of the current Protocol periodUnited States requirements have been cut from 57,600 tons in 1942 to 46,400 tonsin 1943. It is hoped that by this means United Nations stocks may be keptvirtually intact during 1943.165. Coal. Production in the coal year ending the 1st May, 1943, is now estimated at 202-275 million tons, i.e., an increase of 5 million tons over theestimate made in September 1942. Since the rate of consumption has fallen by nearly 8 million tons per annum as a result of the Ministry of FueFs publicity campaign and other measures, it seems probable that (with a contribution of2 million tons from outcrop coal and inferior fuel from colliery banks) the coalbudget will be balanced at about 204-6 million tons for the year 1942-43. these estimates are based on the assumption that weather conditions in February, Marchand April 1943 are the same as they were in these months of 1942.
166. The Minister of Fuel and Power is satisfied that with reasonable,,-ood luck&apos; the coal budget for 1943-44 can also be balanced. Production isestimated at a minimum of 200 million tons, with outcrop workings givinganother 4 million. Consumption of 206-1 million tons is expected. If outputdoes not exceed the minimum quoted the deficiency will have to be made good by further use -of inferior fuel, further economies by industrial consumers andpossibly some destocking. Stocks at the end of December 1942 stood at21,407,000 tons.167. These 1943-44 estimates make no allowance, however, for possiblestrategical requirements. There is no doubt that a Round-up, for instance, wouldmake heavy demands on our coal supplies. In 1937-39 we exported an annual average of 6-9 million tons to France and of 1-6 million tons to Norway. Theannual rate of export to France rose to 10-0 million tons in the first five monthsof 1940, while the Norwegian rate remained fairly stable. Since the fall ofFrance, and particularly in recent months, lack of coal has, it is understood, beena. serious handicap to French production even for German use.The General Raw Materials Position.168. In the United Kingdom the year has seen an expansion of militaryand indirect military consumption of materials to a level which will not beequalled in 1943. Shortage of imports and some supply difficulties havemeant that this level of consumption has been possible only at the cost of heavy destocking, so that we are very near to minimum stocks of certain criticalmaterials. -Part of the import deficiency, especially in the first and the lastmonths of the year, was due to lack of shipping and to losses at sea; but in thecase of some vital materials, such as copper and rubber, there were deficienciesof global United Nations supply.169. The appearance of serious scarcities of materials, affecting, inparticular, the United States war economy, has imposed considerable imp rove-men ts in control both of Allied and of United States material resources. Copper,rubber, tin. molybdenum and several other materials all now come under inter-national allocation by the Combined Raw Materials Board, and special CombinedCommittees have been set up for steel, copper and rubber. These Committees areto be responsible for assembling and reviewing data relating to the supply,requirements, stocks and consumption of the materials in question.170. Till late in 1942, man-power was the main limiting factor on UnitedKingdom production programmes. The shipping difficulties of the last fewmonths have appreciably changed the situation, and. it is now likely that rawmaterial supplies will impose a limit of at least equal severity. The&apos; reductions of War Office requirements and the economies recommended by Lord Portal andSir Walter Laytori have considerably reduced the consumption of raw materials.At the same time the planned transfer of resources during this year from theMinistry of Supply to the Ministry of Aircraft Production and to Admiraltywork, will probably on balance save in tonnage of raw materials per head. Butfurther economies will be necessary before our net consumption of imported materials is brought within the limits of our probable importing capacitv, andthese must almost, certainly involve reductions in our present planned programmes[25214]G

The growth of the munitions industries is shown in the followingTable :-Indices of growth of total operatives in the Munitions Industries.(June 1939 = 100.)Date.	Engineering and Allied.

In 1942 the estimated number of operatives employed on government orders in the Munitions industries increased by 519,000 (men 148,000: women371,000). The numbers at the beginning, the middle and the end of the year were as follows :  December 31st, 1941June 30th, 1942...December 31st, 1942Men.2,306,0002,416,3002,454,000Woman.971,0001,204,2001,342,000Total.3,277,0003,620,5003,796,000

In the light of the Survey of Man-Power made by the Ministry ofLabour and National Service, the Cabinet in December fixed the allocations ofman-power up to the end of 1943 for the Services and for the industrial require-ments of the Supply Departments. These were necessarily fixed in terms of all categories of workers, and not of operatives only. The estimated total man-powerengaged on work for the three Supply Departments at 1st July and 31st December,.1942. and the balance of their allocations for 1943 are shown below : Man-Power Allocations in the Munitions Industries.(All categories of workers.)Department.

(42) 539).(b) Revised on the basis shown in paragraph 173 above.175. During the first six months of the eighteen months&apos; period covered bythese allocations the total number on work for the three Supply Departments isestimated to have increased by 191,000. This is 36 per cent, of the total allocation,achieved in 33 per cent, of the period covered. The cut in the numbers employedon Ministry of Supply work had not begun to take effect by the end of the year,and consequently the distribution of the supply as between that Department andM.A.P. did not conform to the pattern of the allocation.(iii) THE GROWTH OF PART-TIME WORK.176. There has been a rapid growth in the number of part-time womenoperatives in the Munitions Industries. The figures at each of the four quarters of 1942 are given below :  
Part-time women operatives in the muutions industries.1942.	Engineering and Allied industries.	.  Chemicals, explosives, paints, and oils.	Shipbuilding and ship-reparing.	Total.March         ......

Large numbers of workers must be transferred to the munitions industries in 1943 if the numbers on work for the Admiralty and Ministry of aircraft Production are to expand according to programme. The substantialexpansion of the munitions industries already accomplished makes it more andmore difficult to achieve further increases. The growth in numbers is inevitablyaccompanied by greater wastage, and to achieve the same numerical increase amuch larger number of workers must now be ti&quot;ansferred to munitions than was needed even twelve months ago. The gross intake required can only be found from three main sources, the release of labour from Ministry of Supply work;further recruitment from the unoccupied; and further transference from the less essential industries. Present programme revisions are not likely to lead to anycontinuing surplus of labour from Ministry of Supply work, and even if shortageof raw materials should lead to a somewhat larger reduction than that alreadycontemplated, the effective supply from this source will be only a small proportionof the total demand. There are signs of a marked decline in the numbers thatare becoming available from the unoccupied, and accordingly the greatest possiblecontribution must be obtained from the less essential industries.
