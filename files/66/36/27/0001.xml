Printed for the War Cabinet.  April 1943.SECRET. CoPy No-W.P. (43) 177. April 27, 1943.TO BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK  AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.GERMAN MAN-POWER.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.I recently asked about the increase of the German armed forces likely to result from the recent comb-out of industry. I now circulate, for the informationof the War Cabinet and Defence Committee, a note prepared by the IntelligenceStaffs.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,April 27, 1943.

SECRET.IN an estimate, made at the beginning of February, of the German man-power situation during this year, we calculated that during 1943 the germans would comb out from industry some 670,000 men for the armed forces.Since that estimate was made, strong evidence has reached us that thecomb-out is likely to reach at least a million. Thus we must expect the intakeduring this year&apos;of the German armed forces from this source to be at least a million. It would be unsafe to assume that the final figure will not be even higher. The economic risks of this drastic comb-out have apparently beenaccepted by the German High Command despite the protests of their economicand industrial advisers. The short-term advantage of maintaining the strengthof the German armed forces will, of course, be compensated by the effect on industry and, therefore, in turn upon the armed forces themselves, of withdrawingso large a part of the labour force.25348]
