Two U-boats were probably damaged by aircraft in the Bay of Biscay and a Canadian aircraftprobably damaged another south of Greenland. In the North Atlantic a U.S.aircraft and aircraft from U.S. Bogue (escort-carrier) possibly damaged two-boats. Details of the attacks by the escorts of the outward-bound convoy, whichhas been heavily attacked, have not yet been received.During the 23 days since intensive operations by aircraft against U-boats inthe Bay of Biscay began 59 sightings and 38 attacks have been carried out.Enemy Intelligence.German.8.

MILITARY SITUATION.Tunisia.18. During the past week there has been very heavy fighting on all sectors.The enemy, who is obviously determined to resist to the last man, has strongly opposed all our attempts to advance, and has launched many counter-attacks.This has resulted in the rate of progress by our forces being slowed down, and inthe central sector, where the fighting has been perhaps the hardest of all, several important hill features have changed hands two or three times. At the end ofthe week our forces resumed a general offensive.U.S. Forces.19. In the northern sector U.S. forces, supported by French native troops,exerted strong pressure on the enemy positions in the mountains that lie west of Lake Achkel. This has had the effect of considerably accelerating the pace of the enemy&apos;s withdrawal into the Bizerta area. Early on the 3rd advancedelements of the U.S. armour entered Mateur, from which the enemy had alreadybeen forced to withdraw. North and south of Mateur the U.S. infantry alsopushed forward and, by the 5th. were concentrated to the south of MaisonCantonniere and about 10 miles east of Djebel Sidi Meftah. while in the coastalregion the French had reached Djebel Cheniti, a hill immediately to the north of lake Achkel. The enemy was still withdrawing in the face of U.S. pressure,although in the coastal region on the 4th they made an unsuccessful counter-attack in an attempt to hold up the French advance.First Army.20. In the central sector, where enemy resistance was fiercest, progress was somewhat slower. North of the River Medjerda, however, British infantrymanaged to advance three miles on a three-mile front. South of the River therocky height of Djebel Bou Aoukaz was the scene of some very bloody fighting,and although at first we secured a foothold on the western slopes, we were laterforced to make a slight withdrawal. South of the Medjez El Bab-Tunis road asimilar situation obtained in the region of Sidi Abdullah, and again we were forced back about a mile to the village of Sidi Meclien and the bend in the road which is known as Peters Corner. On the 4th the enemy launched anothercounter-attack against our positions between Djebel Bou Aoukaz and PetersCornei&apos; supported by tanks. After a sharp engagement this attack was repulsedand 12 enemy tanks were knocked out and subsequently blown up by our Sappers.Later the total was increased to 14 when two more tanks were destroyed.On the evening of the 5th. after intense aerial bombardment and concentratedartillery support, our infantry successfully attacked Djebel Bou Aoukaz. early on the 6th the First Army continued the offensive with an attack in force east ofMedjez El Bab. After meeting at first minor opposition, all initial objectives were captured.Further south the French pushed on towards Pont Du Fahs and at first met with little opposition. By the 4th, however, the enemy resistance had stiffenedand his artillery activity had increased, particularly against the advance whichwas directed upon Zaghouan.Eighth A rmy.21. The situation on the Eighth Army front remained on the whole quiet,and although the enemy made local counter-attacks we nowhere gave any ground.On the left flank light armoured patrols, operated in the region of Saouaf, wherethey had some difficulty in negotiating extensive enemy minefields.The Russo-German Campaign.22. It has again been a quiet week on the Eastern front, except in theTaman Peninsula, where the Russians have been attacking the German bridge-head from the North and East. As a result of these attacks the Germans havebeen forced to evacuate Rrimskaya.The Russians attempted a landing on the north coast of the peninsula, butit appears to have been on a small scale and to have had no success.The Russians claim that during the course of six days&apos; fighting south-west of Novorossisk they killed 7,000 Germans and defeated all attempts to eliminate the Russian bridgehead. There have been no fresh German attacks in this area in the past week and. the Russian bridgehead is still intact.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.28. Bomber Command aircraft made heavy night attacks on Dortmundand Essen and, by day, U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) bombed an M.T. depot at Antwerp.In the Mediterranean area bad weather restricted operations. successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Gulf of Tunis.United Kingdom.29. During daylight no enemy aircraft were reported over land, but twoAle. 109s were destroyed by Typhoons off the South Coast.At night, nine enemy aircraft crossed the East Coast on the 4th/5th.Coastal Operations.30. Escorted Beaufighters attacked a convoy of 15 ships off Ijmuiden; two large merchantmen and a minesweeper were torpedoed and set on fire, andanother minesweeper appeared to be burning.A Hampden probably torpedoed a 3,500-ton ship off Norway.Eighteen torpedo-Beaufighters with an escort of 40 Beaufighters were despatched to attack the cruiser nurnberg sighted southbound off the south-westcoast of Norway. The cruiser was not located, but heavy flak from shore batteriesand numerous enemy fighters were encountered; seven Beaufighters are missing.Uighters and fighter-bombers, attacking shipping off the French channelcoast, destroyed two small ships and damaged a 2,500-ton armed-freighter and sixsmall ships. *Bomber Command aircraft, of which 51 were despatched, laid 167 sea-mines in enemy waters; one aircraft was lost.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.31. At Antwerp, the Ford and General Motors assembly plant, now engaged on repairing and manufacturing M.T. for the enemy, was attacked in good[25410] b 323. The weather in the past few weeks has been warm and dry, and theground along the Russian front is probably drying quickly. Large-scale operations may be expected to begin fairly soon, at least in the area southwardsfrom Moscow.Burma.Arakan Front.  &apos;24. On the eastern side of the Mayu range the enemy have made three attacks on our positions in the Seinnyinbya area. These attacks have all been repulsedand. although our outposts have withdrawn slightly our main positions areunchanged.In the centre sector our troops have been in contact with the enemy on thespine of the Mayu Ridge, but there is little change in the situation. On thewest of the ridge there is nothing to report. It is estimated that the japanese have four battalions up on this front.Chindwin A rea.25.   In the Chin Hills there has been patrol activity only.South-West Pacific.New Guinea.26. Allied patrols, operating in the Mubo area, have encountered strongJapanese defensive positions one and a quarter miles north-east of Mubo. Theyhave killed 26 of the enemy in recent fighting.South Pacific.27. United States forces are now established on the Russell Islands north-west of Guadalcanal. These islands were occupied without opposition inFebruary last, some time after enemy resistance had ceased on Guadalcanal.
weather by 65 U.S. Fortresses (B. 17); 145 tons of H.E. were dropped and&quot; good &quot; bombing is reported. An attempt, also by U.S. Fortresses (B.17), to bomb the docks at St. Nazaire was marred by heavy cloud; 45 aircraft attacked the estimated target area but no results could be seen. On these two operationsenemy fighter casualties inflicted by the bombers and by aircraft engaged onescorts and diversionary sweeps were 26 destroyed and 31 probably destroyed;seven U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) and three fighters are missing.Attacks, either by light or medium bombers, were made oh railway targets at Thionville and Abbeville, power stations at the Hague and Ijmuiden, and,on three occasions, on the Royal Dutch Steelworks at Ijmuiden. An attempt by 12 Venturas (B. 34) to bomb the power station at Amsterdam was unsuccessful-the formation was heavily attacked by enemy fighters and ten of the aircraft were lost.Night.32. On the night of the 4th/5th, 596 bombers were despatched againstDortmund which, with a population of 550,000, is one of the chief centres of heavy industry in Germany and, next to Duisburg, the principal transport centre of the Ruhr. In very favourable weather conditions, 495 aircraft attacked the target at which 1,558 tons of H.E. and incendiaries were dropped; this is thehighest tonnage yet dropped on any one target in a single attack. A well-con-centratecl attack, with a tendency towards the north of the city, developedaround the markers, a feature being the number of large explosions reported,two of which illuminated aircraft flying at 15,000 feet.On the night of 30th/lst, 238 aircraft, employing blind-bombing technique,attacked Essen through thick cloud; 793 tons of bombs and incendiaries were dropped but, in the absence of photographic or visual evidence, no results canbe estimated.On the week&apos;s operations, which also included two small attacks on Bocholtand Rheine, 43 bombers are missing and a further eight crashed either&apos; in thiscountry or the sea,Light bombers, on offensive patrols, probably damaged a transformer stationnear Lamballe (N. France).Mediterranean.Italy and Sicily.33. Naples was attacked by 22 Liberators (B. 24), the bombs being wellconcentrated in the dock area. Two attacks were made by Liberators (B. 24) onReggio Di Calabria; a total of 121 aircraft were despatched, but on account of bad weather only 20 were able to bomb the target. Seven Liberators (B. 24)attacked Taranto dropping 14 tons of bombs.The ferry terminus at Messina was twice attacked by Liberators (B.24);about 150 tons of bombs were dropped. Hits were seen on the ferry berths, and subsequent reconnaissance showed a hit on the railway station and four tracksdestroyed.Sicilian Channel.34. Many sorties were flown over the Gulf of Tunis by escorted fighter-bombers. On the 30th a total of over 500 Kittyhawks (P. 40) and war hawks(P. 40 F), all carrying bombs, sank a destroyer, a large launch, an E-boat and asiebel ferry; in addition, a 1,500-ton ship and an E-boat were set on fire. Duringother similar operations a landing-craft was blown up and two others set on fire;a 3,000-ton ship was hit and later seen beached ; two other ships of a similar sizewere hit, one being sunk and the other set on fire. Several other small ships,E-boats and ferries were damaged, and many attacks made on a beached destroyer.A number of enemy aircraft was shot down during these operations.Spitfires from Malta set on fire a large schooner. Mitchells (B. 25) andLightnings (P. 38) bombed and hit two merchant vessels. During other attacksa light cruiser was set on fire and another ship hit. Naval Albacores damaged and possibly sank a 1,000-ton ship 20 miles S.E. of Cape Bon.During a shipping reconnaissance 12 Spitfires encountered at least 15 Me. 110sand eight Me. 109s; seven enemy aircraft were shot down. A Beaufighter basedon Bone intercepted and destroyed five Ju. 52s 30 miles south of Sardinia. Fiveenemy aircraft were destroyed during an attack on one of our convoys offBenghazi.  A few Me. 109s approached Malta; one was destroyed by A.A.
Tunisia.35. In support of our land, forces bombers and fighter-bombers main-tained a heavy scale of attack on enemy positions, troops and tank concentrations,mechanical transport and guns. Especially heavy attacks were&apos;made in the areasof Massicault and Ksar Tyr. Other attacks, but on a lighter scale, were made atTebourba and in the southern sector. At Zaghouan (15 miles E. of Pont duFahs) on the 4th 122 medium and light bombers were despatched to attackenemy positions. Offensive sweeps were flown by fighters over&apos; the battle areas,but enemy activity was on a comparatively light scale.The airfield at Mabtouha was bombed by Mitchells (B. 25) and Marauders(B. 26); four aircraft on the ground were seen to receive direct hits. night attacks were made by Wellingtons on the airfields at El Aouina and Sidi Ahmed.The airfield at Lampedusa was attacked by 19 Spitfires carrying bombs.Fifty-five Fortresses (B. 17) were despatched to attack Bizerta, but, on accountof bad weather, only 14 were able to bomb the target; five Fortresses (B. 17) are reported missing.Fighter-bombers during shipping searches in the Gulf of Tunis heavily attacked the docks at Kelibria and jetties and buildings at Sidi Daoud. Thejetties at Menzel Temime (44 miles E. of Tunis) were also bombed and a large firestarted.Mqean Sea.36. Beaufighters bombed and set on fire a small southbound ship north ofMilo.

During the week 9,131 sorties were flown in the Mediterranean area and the following casualties are reported : Destroyed or miss-ing.  Damaged.Allied   .........      ... 64 37Destroyed.      Probable.     Damaged.Enemy............   74 11 40Russia.38. Considerable activity has been reported from the Novorossisk area,where the S.A.F. is actively supporting the Russian land forces, both inattacks on the front line and in air battles with the G.A.F. It is also reportedthat the S.A.F. has sunk a number of German ships, including a tanker, in the black Sea.In the Izyum and Balakleya sectors Soviet air activity seems to have been directed against airfields and railway stations. It is reported that as a resultof one attack 15 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.In the far north the Russians claim to have sunk two ships in the barents sea.Soviet long-range bombers have again raided Konigsberg.Though G.A.F. activity in the Kuban area has declined somewhat duringthe last two weeks, it would appear that a higher scale of effort has been main-tained than was the case a month ago. G.A.F. activity on the whole of the restof the Eastern front is thought to be on a relatively low scale.Burma.39. Allied fighters and light*bombers attacked enemy positions to the north of Myitkyina, in the Upper Chindwin and on the Mayu Peninsula.Railway installations and communications were the principal targets for allied aircraft operating over Central and North Burma. In the Pinbaw/Myitkyina area, two bridges were damaged; at Nankan, in the Katha area, twospans of a railway bridge were destroyed; near Mandalay, the bridge at Myitngewas hit; and. damage was clone to the northern approaches to the GokteikViaduct.In the Upper Chindwin, Blenheims bombed.

AtKunming, which was attacked by 21 escorted bombers, fighters destroyed ten ofthe enemy without loss.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.40. Two Liberators (B. 24) bombed and left sinking a 5.000-ton ship in Manokwari Harbour (N.E. Dutch New Guinea).Except for an attack by six Liberators (B. 24) on the airfield at Babo(W. coast of New Guinea), where large fires were started, activity has been confined to attacks by single heavy bombers on enemy occupied towns and villages, and by light bombers on installations in the Mubo area.New Britain.41.

Three small-scale attacks were made on Koepang airfield.A usiralia.44. An attack on Darwin airfield by 21 escorted enemy bombers resulted in only slight damage. Spitfires intercepted and destroyed six enemy aircraft andprobably destroyed, or damaged, 13 more. Thirteen Spitfires were lost, six ofthe casualties being due to engine trouble or petrol shortage; ten pilots are safe.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.45. Enemy bombing during the week was confined to the night of the4th/5th, when H.E. and incendiary bombs and parachute mines were scattered over Norfolk.

Destroyer Bevertey.APPENDIX VI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Germany.Stettin.-Photographs taken on the 21st April show the whole centre of thetown covered with smoke, and further photographs, taken on the 22nd, show24 fires still burning.Almost the whole of the damage is concentrated south of the Kaiser WilhelmPlatz and is particularly severe in the Pommei ensdorf district, where an: areaof about 100 acres of closely grouped industrial buildings is completelydevastated. This includes the large chemical works A.G. der ChemischerProdukten-Fabriken Pommerensdorf-Milch, believed to manufacture fertilisersand associated chemicals, where the whole area of 51 acres has been devastated,and two factories producing edible oils, A. Ft. Zander and Paul Julius Stahlberg,and the Didier Werke A.G., manufacturers of Catalysts.Damage has also occurred to the Sachsenberg shipyard, where the main shop(190 ft. by 105ft.) has been destroyed over an area of 1,200 sq. yards; Kruger&apos;sboat building yard, Stettiner Oderwerke A.G. shipyard and the Naval BaseBredower Werder.Military installations have suffered considerably and from a long list maybe mentioned the pioneer barracks, the police barracks, the intelligence division and the Proviant Amt. (provision depot) where damage is extensive. In the artillery magazine at Torney, four buildings have been demolished and onedamaged.Many public and commercial buildings, including the Courts of Justice, aredestroyed or damaged, and it is estimated that the town has suffered a loss ofabout 3,700 flats (house units) in addition to at least 320 houses.Railway property, including the main passenger and goods stations, has also suffered damage, and in all about 50 goods trucks have been burnt out.The following eye-witness account has been received :  Fires were so widespread that it was impossible for the firemen to attemptto cope with them, and all available brigades were therefore concentrated on public utilities, and on the docks and harbour area.   Shortly after the attack
began the authorities appealed to Berlin to send extra fire brigades, but in viewof the Mosquito attack which they feared might develop into something bigger,help was refused. In spite of reinforcements from Stargard and Pasewalk,private houses and buildings in central and residential districts had simply to beleft to burn.Eight days after the attack lighting in many districts was still dependenton candles and spirit lamps and water was being pumped up from the River Oderand boiled for human consumption.The informant ends his account : &quot; What saved Stettin from almost total destruction was the fact thatthere was no wind either on night of raid or on two following days. Ifthere had been I shudder to think what Stettin would look like now. As itis, it looks as if centre of city has been knocked flat. It was a hell of abang.&quot;Another report states that two days after the attack 25 emergency feedingcentres were opened in Stettin.Duisburg. Photographs taken following the attacks on the 8th/9th and the9th/ 10th April, show that workshops and buildings in three separate branches ofthe Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. (munitions) have been damaged. A bicyclefactory and another producing electrical apparatus have been severely damaged,the goods station partially destroyed, and there is damage to an engine round-house and to a workshop at the locomotive repair shops.Speyer. In the middle of March an informant passed through reports thatthe station and marshalling yard had been severely damaged as a result of a recent R.A.F. attack.   Buildings nearby had also suffered.Sea-mining.The following mining casualties have been reported :  March 5. The Danish In-arid (100 tons) was damaged by a mine in theGreat Belt.March G.
