It has, however, been found impracticable to carryout the approved policy without some departure from the precise terms of this conclusion,  as the Resident Ministerreported that the establishment of Government distillerieswould be strongly opposed by African opinion and in anycase the necessary staff and equipment could not be madeavailable.    On the other hand, Lord Swinton consideredthat a system of distillation under licence administered&apos;through the Native Administrations would be practicable and that the Chiefs and African opinion could be relied upon to collaborate in suppressing the illicitdistillation, which has been on the increase since the warbegan.3&apos;      After consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, I have informed Lord Swinton that I agree to the introduction of the system oproposes.Colonial Office,.28th April, 19U3*0.
