DRAy.:&apos; TEI^GRAM No.  1. TO LORD HALIFAX.Your telegram No, 1707,1,      The position has been considered by the WarCabinet.      Subject to what follows, they are in favour of opening discussion:   with the United States on commercial policy,  on the basis of view a, as set out in paragraphs-10 of (43)  136, with one important modification -(see (vil)  of telegram No,  3j.      a copy of this document was sent to ; ou on 9th -April.M,      Ly two immediately following telegrams contain:-(a) instructions as to the lines on which,  whenthe time comes, we would wish you to speak to Mr. hulls(b) the text of an aide-memoire to be left withMr, Hull at this interview.3.      The &quot;Mar Cabinet have, however, decided that unless a situation arises which makes this unavoidable,you should not broach this matter to the United StatesGovernment until there has been an exchange of views withthe Dominion Governments^4,      We are therefore sending to the DominionGovernments copies of the two immediately following telegrams, and are informing them that it is on theselines that we suggest that an approach should be made atthe appropriate moment to the United States Government.Copy of the covering telegram to the Dominion Governments isbeing repeated to you.5.     We arc inviting the Dominion Governments to sendexperts to this country as soon as possible for an exchange of views on this matter with our experts.6.      The Dominion   Governments are also being told that you v/ill not open up the matter with the United StatesGovernment until /ou receive further instructions from us.

Wo hcrpa that it will not bo necessary that you should give the United States Government any indication of theviews which the United Kingdom Government have formed -even on the tentative basis indicated in the two following telegrams - until   iften the exchange of views with theDominion exports*     We apprehend, however,  that a situation might arise,  e6gc  out of the forthcoming Food Conference,in which we should feel compelled to indicate our views to the United States Government,,      Should such a situationdevelop, any views which you might bo authorised tocommunicate would bo the provisional views of the UnitedKingdom Government only,,-7,     V/e will, of course, keep you informed of any important re-actions which we obtain from the DominionGovernments, and of any developments in the situation atthis end.     We would be grateful if you would also keepus in touch with the position in Washington and would give us early warning if a situation seems likely to developwhich would result in forcing our hands, and would makeit imperative for some indication to be given to the UnitedStates authorities of what we have in mindeDRAFT TELEGRAM NO.2 TO LORD HALIFAX.Please see my immediately preceding telegram.When you are authorised to communicate to Mr.Hull the aide-memoire referred to in that telegram, you should make the following points orally:-(a) The recommendations contained in the aide-memoire are submitt od tentatively as a possible basis of informal exploratory and entirely non-committal discussions between experts in the same way as has been done in the cases of the Stabil-ization Fund and Clearing Union,

(b) As is clear from the text of Article VII of the mutual Aid Agreement, all the matters mentionedtherein are&apos; closely inter-related,  and plans fortheir eventual regulation must be inter-lockingsThus, the question of commercial policy cannotbe treated in isolation:    it must be treatedas an integral part of a broader inter-national economic policy,  including,  inter alia,plans for regulating INTERNATIONAL :nal financial relations,  stabilising the markets for primary products,  and facilitating the flow of long-termint;rnat i onal invc s tmont 0(c) Induod, as there can be no economic securitywithout politico-strategic security, the financialand economic plans for a better world mustultimately be linked with political and strategicalplans.      That better order can only come to &quot;passif economic, political and strategical elementscontribute to form a coherent whole.The features cf the plan suggested in the aide-memoire must accordingly be judged against this larger background.(d) The plan has been drawn up in the light of what we conceive to bo the needs and sentiments of others.      For instance, general views expressed to us by the refugee Governments in London on thesubject of post-war commercial policy have beentaken into account.     An attempt has been made to strike a balance betweuii what wo think would suitus, what we know of other peoples&apos;  views, what we ourselves might be prepared to concocle within the framework of a general scheme and what we think there is a fair chance of inducing others toaccept,

(e) The stage of formal commitments is as yet a longway off.      Mo are still in the phase of trying torough out the general -principles which shouldinspire subsequent negotiations0     While we con-tenrplate the ultimate negotiation of a multilateralConvention, we naourally wish,  in acordancc with article VII,  to open the discussion of these general principles in the first instance withDRi-JMT Tgj^GRAM NO.   5 TO LORD HALIFAX.Ay telegram No. The following is a drafto    the aide -memo ire which you might present to Mr,. Hull.Begins,      As has been stated on man^roccasions, HisMajesty&apos;s Government favours a commercial policy designedto promote general economic expansion and joint actiondirected towards the removal of the obstacles to inter-national trade.      While,  during the transitional period immediately after the war   when we are seeking to restoreour balance of trade.we may have to retain some special measures of control, we hope that we and other countries will bo able to emerge from this stage without undue delay*      It is with this in mind, and as a contributionto the conversations to which we are committed underArticle VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement,  that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment submits for consideration the following points which form a practical approach to this problem, and whichmight prove suitable for discussion among the united nations.(i) An international commercial policy capable of helping towards the solution of tho post-war economic and political problems would have to be

accompanied by some&quot;form of multilateral financialclearing and the adopting of a system which allowsand encourages an expansive world economy,(ii) The policy should also bo based on the assumption.   of a multilateral commercial agreement,  embracingas many countries as possible-, Groat britain is ctmpelied to rely on imports for a largo pro - -portion of its food and raw materials, some modusfor exporting an    equivalent amount is absolutely essential.      More bi-lateral agreements, howeveradvantageous, cannot moot the situation, whereasa multi-lateral agreement, laying down certainprinciples for the freer exchange of commodities,can. be of great benefit.iii) The United Kingdom, both by tradition and by experience, regards an increased freedom of trade as particularly in her interest,,      &apos;./e shall join in any movement to secure it and, when it comesdown to practice, we should have every motiveto encourage it, both from our own point ofview and on account of the general internationalbenefit.      Our sympathy is entirely with those whoare seeking to remove barriers to Trade.    Anyqualifications wo may have to make will be due tothe special difficulties of the immediate post-war period and the present uncertainty as to what will, in. fact, lie within ou? power and that ofother countries.(iv) We would accept a moderate ceiling for tariffsfor incorporation in a multilateral agreement,.(v) We should be prepared to make all our arrangements,including particularly quantitative restriction ofimports, on a basis of mutual non-discrimination.Preferences, which we do not regard as discrimin-explanatory in a strict sense of the word,  are dealt withbelow. r..-5-

(vi) Quito apart from our own position, a general plan     J *should leave room for special arrangements withinpolitical and geographical groups, since thoso arelikely to -be asked for and could bo properly conceded in many casesi      As part of a comprehensive schemefor the betterment of the trade of the world as awhole., we should be prepared to play our full part inany general scheme for reducing preferences*(vii) -7e consider that the quantitative regulation ofimports should not ordinarily be employed for the primary purpose of protecting heno industries, but rather regar ed as a mechanism appropriate and useful for special purposes,  including,  among others,  theSafe-guarding of a country1s balance of payments andfor implementing approved international commodity agreements and on security grounds.     Uo should beprepared to agree from the outset that such regulations should be on a non-discriminatory basis.      In so faras quantitative regulation is used for safeguardinga country1s balance of payments, we suggest thatcommon agreement might be reached concerning a more orless automatic and objective test of the conditions under which such action should be permissible   &apos; Forexample, it might be found that the statistics resultingfrom the creation of an international monetaryauthority could bo used for this purpose.(viii)We should be prepared to agree to measures designed to prevent export subsidies,(ix) Room should be left for State trading but it wouldbo desirable that it should be conducted inaccordance with a code to bo agreed,(x) V/e believe that these points could best be coveredby the formulation of a general commercial code towhich all countries would be invited to subscribe.Ends.

DRAFT T5Ll;G]ii,M TO DOMINION GQVDRNi/iSNTS.;.s you know, it is expected that Food Conferencein United States will form part of a general programme of separate but inter-related discussions covering in pursuanceof Article 7 of the Mutual Aid agreement the whole field of post-war monetary and economic policy       Wo foci, therefore,that we must bo prepared for very early conversations withthe United States in regard to ether subjects in the programmeand7 in -particular in regard to post-war commercial policya2*     Lord Halifax has recommended that so far ascommercial policy is concerned,  our best course would be tomake a very early approach to the State Department on theofficial level with a view to testing theirreactions0    Howould propose, in conjunction with such an approach, to speak himself to Mr. Hull with a view to paving the way foran exchange of ideas,  and ho feels that the appropriate moment for such an initiative would be immediately afterCongress has passed the Bill to renew the Trade --greementsAct, i.o. probably at the end of May at the latest-,3e     We concur generally in Lord Halifax&apos;c view-that we should take the initiative in this matter,  and after-careful consideration of the linos on.....which a preliminaryand exploratory approach might best be made, we are sendinghim a draft Aide Memoirs which,  subject to what follows,we suggest &amp;o should hand to Mr. Hull when the time comes,Tex c,s of draft Aide Memoire and of supplementary instruct-ions indicating line on which he might speak to Mr. Hullare contained in two immediately following telegrams04.     At the same time, it has boon explained to lord halifax that we are most anxious, unless our hands areunavoidably forced, that the subject should not bo broachedin airy way with the United States until there has beenopportunity for an exchange of views with DominionGovernments,     He has been told that wo are approaching

you iraraodiatoly wit!   a view to arranging -or such an exchange of views and that, in the noantime, he is to take no action on the. draft ..idc Memoire or to open the subject in any way without further instructions from usc5.      Wo fool that the best and most expeditious procedure for such an exchange of views, which must necessarily atthis stage be of an entirely preliminary and non-committalcharacter, would bo through the holding as early aspossible of an informal conference on the official andexpert level similar to that which took place last autumnon the Clearing Union and Buffer Stock plans0      Such aconfer nee would, we feel, have great value in enablingour experts (a)  to explain more fully than can be doneby telegraph the general background as seen here,  the main issues likely t    arise and the way in which our thoughtsare turning on those issues;    (b)  to exchange ideas with dominion representatives in regard to those aspects of broadpolicy to which individual Dominion Governments are likelyto attach speei il importance, without at this stage going into matters  :;f  detail $    (c)  to obtain the benefit of suchconstructive suggestions as Dominion representatives may,on their part., be able to put forward either in regard tothe preliminary approach to the United States or to sub-sequent proce &quot;iure.68     We hope that Dominion Governments will share ourview that such a joint meeting of experts on a purely informalexploratory and non-committal basis would be very valuableat this stage*      In view of the possibility that matters may now develop) rapidljr in the United. States, we are most anxious that such a meeting should be held at the earliest possible date*     We should, be most grateful,  therefore, for very early intimation whether Dominion Governments would be pre-pared to send experts to London to take part in discussionshero which we suggest should open in, say, the third v/eekof May*
