Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1943SECRET. Copy No...W.P. (43) 186.April 30, 1943.WAR CABINET.RELIEF FOR OCCUPIED EUROPE.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.IN May 1942 the War Cabinet rejected a proposal that a supply of limited quantities of milk, for the relief of children only, should be allowed to enteroccupied Europe. Since then many appeals have been received from the exiledGovernments and from philanthropic bodies here and in the United States. no concession has, however, been made beyond the regular shipments to Greece, whichwere authorised in February 1942.2. In face of the increased pressure and the distressing conditions thatundeniably exist, there is now a real danger that the Americans may act on theirown. The President seems to have given some kind of promise to the Norwegians,and Mr. Hull recently informed Lord Halifax that he was being pressed to agree,to a parcels scheme for Norway, and to milk for children being sent to Belgium.There is little doubt that if we had not offered to take part in a joint examinationof the realities of the situation, the United States Government would have pledgedthemselves to allow shipments to both countries. The danger of this happening,although it has lessened for the time being, has by no means disappeared.Nothing could be more unfortunate than any ill-considered concession to someAllies to the exclusion of others. The blockade would be treated in a mannercalculated to produce the maximum of discord among our Allies with disastrouspsychologica 1 consequences.3. I have had two discussions on relief with Governor Lehman. We had a clear understanding that our conversations were purely exploratory, and that our-conclusions would have to be approved by our Governments.   I annex : (A) A record of our discussions.(B) Some notes on the suggested approach to the examination of the subject.(C) A draft basis for replies, while the question is being examined, to reliefappeals from our Allies and from humanitarian bodies,4. It will be seen that we are committed to nothing beyond (subject to cabinet approval and that of the United States Government) a joint examinationhi Washington of the practical possibilities of sending relief if the existing policy were changed; though it no doubt follows that we should have further consulta-tions with the Americans after the Washington enquiry, and in the light of thegeneral situation then existing on the Continent. I should give explicitinstructions to our representative on the Committee of Enquiry that its recommendations should be confined to advice as to the possibilities of supply,shipping and control of distribution, if any change in existing policy were decided upon.5-   I ask my colleagues to approve :  (i) The suggested joint examination in Washington.(ii) The general line of approach proposed in Annex (B).(iii) The draft basis for replies to relief appeals.[25378] B
0. I also ask my colleagues to consider what line should be taken in replying to parliamentary questions, or if a debate on this subject is forced upon us in either house. One reason for my request is that Parliamentary interest in the matter is being stimulated by humanitarian &quot; pressure groups,&quot; another is that Parlia-mentary opponents of relief increasingly demand a reasoned reafhrmation of our existing policy in order to counter the relief agitation. I annex (D) a draft reply covering the main points that have been raised. The substance of this reply would presumably have to be agreed with the United States Government before it,could be given in Parliament.7. If the blockade were relaxed by our agreeing to send some milk andvitamins to occupied -Europe, it should be possible to obtain Swedish ships fromthe Baltic for the purpose. The supply difficulty, which has not, I think, yetbeen fully appreciated by the Americans, is, however, great and increasing.8. I believe that the only practicable relief scheme would be one confined, to children, and possibly expectant, and nursing mothers, in certain specified bio-cities in Europe. Such a scheme would give those most in need of it whateveramount of dried milk, &amp;c. might be available, and would have the great advantage that all occupied countries would receive equal treatment at our hands. It is,however, possible that the result of a thorough examination of the question maybe to establish that the supplies which could be spared are so limited that the psychological effect of sending so little would merely tend to discourage the peoples of the occupied territories, while providing excellent propaganda for theenemy.9. Experience in the case of Greece has shown that after a relief scheme hasbeen sanctioned in principle, the negotiations to ensure control of distribution, andto obtain a supply of vessels for regular shipments, take several months. any scheme which might be approved after the proposed Washington enquiry could,therefore, hardly come into operation much before next winter.10. My colleagues may wish to have an appreciation of the present foodconditions on the Continent. I am advised that, while the position is nowhere soacute as in Greece during the autumn and winter of 1941. it is bad in occupiedRussia and Poland, and in some parts of Yugoslavia and Belgium. In descendingorder of &quot; scarcity conditions &quot; the list would be Occupied Russia.Poland.Yugoslavia.Belgium.France.Norway.Greece (after allowing for present relief shipments),Holland.Czechoslovakia,Denmark.11. Conditions are bad in occupied Russia and Yugoslavia because of theirproximity to the front and the savagery of the warfare. In Poland they are badbecause of the particular animosity of the Germans against the Poles, and the active spirit of resistance of the Polish people. Except for these three countries the situation may be described as bad in most of the big towns but not in thecountry districts.12. Babies and young children are, generally speaking, much better off for milk than the other children. The most undernourished are those above seven years old.S.Ministry of Economic Warfare,A -pril 30, 1943.
(A)Record of Meetings on the Question of Relief through the Blockade.The question of the admission of relief food-stuffs (and/or vitamins) throughthe blockade to occupied territories other than Greece was discussed at two meetings with Mr. Lehman at the Ministry of Economic Warfare on the 19th and22nd April. 1943.2. In the course of the discussion, which covered a wide range, Mr. Lehmanindicated that his Government desired, if possible, to work out a scheme foivtheinitiation of relief on a limited and experimental scale to be brought &quot;-intooperation as soon as possible. Such a scheme would, of course, have to be designedto fit into the framework of the existing supply situation, and would have to incorporate the conditions necessary to ensure its success and to prevent the enemyfrom drawing advantage from it. Mr. Lehman considered that the operationof a scheme on these lines would avert psj^chological dangers which otherwisemight result from the maintenance of a purely negative attitude on our part,both among the Allied nationals of the occupied countries serving the cause ofthe United Nations away from their&apos; homes, and in the occupied territories them-selves. He mentioned that the supply of food packages to Norway and ofpowdered milk and vitamins to Belgium had been considered, and that in his view the necessary goods for restricted schemes of this kind for those twocountries could be found; he appreciated, however, that pressure for increasingthe scale of such action in the countries mentioned, and also for extending it toother countries, would be extremely strong, and he thought, therefore, that thesupply situation would first have to be very carefully examined.3. On the,British side attention was drawn to the fundamental consideration that the obligation of feeding any population lay with the occupying Power -an obligation that had been scrupulously honoured by the United Nations in thecases of North Africa, Iceland, Persia and the Middle East. ; Any move on thepart of the Allies to assume an obligation which was Germany&apos;s might not onlyobscure to the oppressed peoples the source responsible for their misery, but might also tempt the Germans to intensify that misery in order to increase thebenevolence of the Allies. It should not be forgotten that by refusing to allow any food to pass through our controls since August 1940 we had, in fact, compelledthe enemy to send into Norway and Belgium substantial quantities of food which otherwise would have been available for his own consumption. It could not be denied that even the Greek scheme had been of some assistance to the enemy.4. We recognised, however, that conditions in the occupied countries might,as in the case of Greece, become so bad that the above-mentioned&apos;disadvantagesand risks-would have to be accepted. This might occur next winter, and there-fore it was necessary now to explore the position carefully.5. We agreed that the necessary tonnage for a limited relief scheme could probably be obtained from Swedish shipping in the Baltic, if the swedish government and the German Government consented to its use. On the otherhand, attention was drawn to the possible hostile reactions of the Russian Govern-ment to any scheme involving the diversion of supplies which might otherwise have been available to them. It was also pointed out that assistance on a sub-stantial scale would be needed by the occupied territories after their liberation,and that there were dangers in assuming commitments elsewhere in respect of commodities which were especially suitable for the initial phases of relief in liberated countries. Mention was also made of the clanger possibly inherent in alimited relief action, of raising expectations of assistance on a scale greater thanthat which in practice could be provided. The possibility would also have to be weighed that, while the first arrival of food-stuffs might produce an excellenteffect, assistance continued at a low level, and prevented by supply considerationsfrom increasing, might provoke considerable discontent. At present the inhabi-tants of the occupied territories knew that they would receive nothing, throughthe blockade, and there was evidence that the reasons for existing policy were generally understood. If, however, it appeared to them that some food couldbe sent, and that we had found a method of minimising the danger to the blockade,there might be bitter disappointment that so little was forthcoming.[25378] b 2
6. It was suggested that the first stage of any examination of the problem should be to determine the limits within which supplies could be made availableso that the best use of these could then be considered and the merits and demeritsof the resulting proposition discussed. With regard to any initial experimentswhich might be&apos;made, it was strongly recommended that action should be confined to particular cities in each occupied country, rather than to a limited number of countries out of the total of possible claimants; it seemed to us most undesirable to give one or two Allies preference over the rest.7. These considerations were advanced, however, rather as points to betaken into account at a later stage than as objections to the approach to theproblem proposed by Mr. Lehman. General agreement was recorded in thefollowing terms :  (a) It might prove desirable to initiate in the coming autumn a relief scheme on a small and experimental scale in the occupied territories.(/A A small Committee consisting of representatives of the State Depart-ment, the British Embassy and the United States Office, of ForeignRelief and Rehabilitation should examine the possibility of such ascheme and submit their recommendations to the two Governments.-(c) Meanwhile, it was desirable that the general line of replies to be given to enquiries and applications concerning a change of blockade policy inthis matter should be agreed, in order that the British and american governments should speak with a. single voice.(d) The possibility of promoting the evacuation of children from occupied countries to Switzerland and Sweden should be further explored: not as an alternative to any relief scheme which it might be decided to propose to the United States and British Governments, but as a.supplementary measure possessing advantages of its own.Ministry of Economic Warfare,A pril 23, 1943.(B)Notes on the Suggested Approach to the Examination of theRelief Problem.It is assumed that the examination of any relief action will be confined to children and expectant and nursing mothers, since these have the strongest claim on humanitarian grounds, and, moreover, assistance successfully administered tothem would be of less advantage to the enemy than a relief scheme for adultsgenerally:2. The nature of the supplies to be employed has to be determined. Forthis purpose consideration will have to be given to the particular needs of the intended recipients, to portability and to facility of control.3. Since most food-stuffs other than cereals are in short supply, it is evidentthat the supply situation must be a decisive factor. The first step should thereforebe to ascertain the maximum amount of the selected commodities which could bemade available for relief purposes in the autumn and winter of 1943 and during1944 without compromising such essential needs as supplies to combatant Alliesand liberated territories.4.. Since any supplies available for the occupied territories are likely to be severely limited, it is necessary to decide on what principle they should be allocated. In so doing regard ought to be had to the need for equitable treatment as between the various Allies. Moreover, since it will probably be found that supplies- available to any one teritory are inadequate to render more than a fraction of the assistance which is desirable, some principle will have to bediscovered according to which the recipients are to be selected.&apos; A decision onthis point will again be influenced by the view taken of what degree of assistance is worth rendering, and what is not. e.g., whether it is better to give four childrena quarter of a pint of milk each, or a whole pint to one child only.
5. It is important thnt any scheme adopted shall bring about a material improvement of the conditions of those whom it is designed to benefit. Thismeans, first, that a careful control must be exercised over the transport and-distribution of the imported supplies themselves. It means, second in order butnot in importance, that a method must be found of ensuring that these supplies are supplementary to what the intended recipients have at present, and thattheir effect is not nullified by a deterioration in local conditions brought about by Axis action. The control necessary in these two respects will involve theacceptance by the Germans of strictly drafted terms, and the institution of asystem of neutral supervision which, to be effective, must include facilities for free movement of personnel and supplies and rapid and secure communicationwith the blockade authorities.6. Various technical details concerned with transport and the financialcosts of supervision in the occupied countries would have to be considered intheir turn.(C)Draft Statement to Form the Basis of Replies to Appeals for Reliefthrough the blockade.The British and American Governments are aware of the grave sufferings ofthe Allied peoples in the territories occupied by the enemy. They deeplysympathise with these sufferings and wish to relieve them.2. ft is, unfortunately, clear that the conditions necessary for effective relief on any significant scale can only exist when the Axis domination in the several countries of Europe has been broken. Nevertheless, the British and american governments have examined the possibility of bringing more immediate assistanceto these countries, while they remain under enemy occupation, by means of importsof suitable commodities through the blockade. Various plans of this nature havereceived the fullest attention of both Governments jointly,&apos; and the problemraised by such plans remains under constant examination.3. However, in considering this question the two Governments are obligedto take into consideration all the relevant strategic and military factors, andthey cannot assume a responsibility in this matter until they are satisfied that whatever steps are taken will not be neutralised by the enemy, who controls the economy of the peoples concerned, and will not imperil the all-important object ofsecuring their early liberation.4. Neither Government considers that it is advisable at this stas;e to changeexisting policy. But the whole problem is the subject of continuous consultation between the two Governments, and the assurance can be given that they wouldinitiate action of the kind described if at any time it appeared to them practicable to do so.(D)Draft Reply to a Parliamentary Question.The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the admission ofiood-stuffs into occupied territories through the blockade has, except in the caseof Greece, remained unchanged since the announcement by the Prime minister on the 20th August, 1940. The responsibility for feeding the territories that hehas overrun lies on the enemy, and we are under no obligation to relieve him ofthat responsibility. Experience has shown that insistence on this fact has haddue effect upon the Axis economy. While the enemy has continued to plunderruthlessly the food-producing, areas under his control, he has been compelled, formilitary and economic reasons, himself to supply food-stuffs to countries normallydependent upon overseas imports. It is clear that, if the United Nations had at any time assumed the burden in whole or in part of feeding such countries,the effect of the blockade would have been considerably weakened.
2. Nevertheless, the British mid American Governments are aware thatthere is much suffering on the continent, and they have under continualexamination the possibility of relieving the Allied peoples by sending them some immediate assistance by means of imports of suitable commodities through theblockade. Unfortunately, however, it is apparent that the conditions necessaryfor effective relief on &quot;any significant scale can only exist when the Axisdomination over the several countries of Europe has been broken. It is alsoclear that any relief scheme would be of some advantage to the enemy. Theresources of the occupied territories have been thoroughly harnessed to the Axiswar machine, and any steps taken to strengthen their economy would inevitablystrengthen the enemy as well.3. The difficulties of supervision by some international or neutral body arefrequently underrated. While it might be possible to ensure that there was no interference with the imported food-stuffs, it would obviously be far more difficultto ensure that the enemy did not indirectly benefit by withdrawing or consuminglarger quantities of domestic produce. This problem would be almost impossibleof solution in any area where there were large numbers of occupying troops.4. The two Governments made a special exception to this general rule whenthey agreed to the Swedish scheme for relief in Greece. Conditions in the Greekcities and islands wrere unique, while, since Greece can make no greatcontribution to the Axis war effort, the enemy had done nothing to discharge his responsibility towards the Greek people. The two Governments fully aeknow-ledge the invaluable services rendered by the Swedish-Swiss Commission, underthe auspices of the International Red Cross. Even in Greece, however, it is clearthat the enemy has obtained some benefit from our sending food-stuffs to peopiewhose labour he has afterwards decided to use.5. For the reasons already given we are not prepared to repeat the Greekscheme in other occupied territories. We have, however, sympatheticallyexamined various schemes for some limited forms of relief in other areas. Wehave regretfully reached the conclusion that these schemes would be of very.doubtful benefit to the peoples concerned, and that it would be neither wise norhumane to change our policy at this stage. Nevertheless, arrangements havebeen made to keep the whole problem under continuous review, and to secure the prompt consideration of new situations as they arise. The twro governments will initiate such action as may be possible if at any time it appears that this canbe done with a reasonable certainty of appreciable benefit to the peoples in the occupied territories and without substantial benefit to the enemy and consequentprolongation of the war. I should add. that, if any change of policy weremade, we do not think that it would be possible to differentiate in principle between one occupied country and another.
