this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.  April 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 165.April 19, 1943.WAR CABINET.SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY FOR INDIA.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I agree generally with the views expressed by the Secretary of State forIndia in Appendix II to W.P. (43) 150.In paragraph 23 of Appendix I to that paper the Minister of Labour and minister of Aircraft Production state that the fact that India by the end of thewar will have wiped out her external debt and accumulated considerable sterling balances should make it possible to embark on an ambitious programme of capital development without recourse either to a high degree of forced saving or to heavyforeign borrowing. 1 think there may be some misapprehension on this point.The Indian Reserve Bank will certainly hold large sterling balances and will haveno difficulty in selling sterling as against rupees. But the Government of india will have to produce the rupees either by additional taxation or by additionalborrowing. Thus, from the internal point of view, there is no difference betweenthe position of India and the position of Russia.I note that in paragraph 30 of Appendix I to W.P. (43) 150 it is statedthat considerable funds are now being set on one side by the Government ofIndia for post-war reconstruction purposes. I was not aware of this, andpossibly this refers to the accumulation of sterling balances which does not provide any means of overcoming the budget difficulties of the indian government.K. W.Treasury Chambers,April. 19, 1943.[25322]
