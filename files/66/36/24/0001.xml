E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,A pril 24, 1943.(1)Prime Minister to President Roosevelt.(No. 280.)1. About two years ago the Government of Northern Ireland wished tohave conscription in its own area and I favoured the policy. However, at thattime American opinion was adverse, and I received both from you and fromWinant strong advice to the contrary. The situation is now changed. UnitedStates forces are in Ireland in considerable numbers, and wre have the spectacle of young Americans taken by compulsion from their homes to defend an area whereyoung fellows of the locality loaf about with their hands in their pockets. Thisaffects not only recruiting, but the work of the important Belfast shipyards whichare less active than the British yards.2. I am thinking therefore of reopening the question and asking theNorthern Ireland Government whether they would like me to have another try.A loud caterwaul may be expected from De Valera, and I should like to knowfirst of all how you feel about it and whether you could do anything to help.11.4.43.(2)Prime Minister from President Roosevelt.(No. 273.)I have received and considered carefully your telegram No. 280 in rega,rdto the conscription question in Northern Ireland. The situation has, I feel,changed as regards public opinion in the United States since this matter wasunder consideration by the Government of Northern Ireland two years ago. Ifrankl)- doubt whether it would create much of an issue in this country. I donot feel that I am in a position to express any opinion concerning the effect in eire and Northern Ireland of the reopening of this question. Your information is, of course, much better than ours in this regard, and you are doubtless in aposition to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of such a move.20.4.43.[25346]
