PART I.-ALLIED NAVAL CONTINGENTS.Notes on the various Allied Navies.Free French Navy.THE recent successes of the Corvettes against enemy Submarines has stillfurther stimulated morale in the Free French Navy.2. The question of a fusion between the forces of General de Gaulle andGeneral Giraud is, of course, very prominent in the minds of officers and men.Some express themselves as hopeful that this will soon be brought about, but thereis no doubt that others are suspicious of General Giraud, as they still bear in mindhis collaboration wih Admiral Darlan.3. There have been no authenticated instances of Free French naval personnel expressing the wish to transfer to General Giraud&apos;s force, although anumber of rumours have been going round. On the other hand, a number of seamen, some of whom are naval ratings or reservists who came to this country in north African French Merchant ships chartered by the Ministry of War Trans-port, have joined the F.N.F.L., and quite a number more are said to be waiting todo so.4. If and when the two forces come together, the very anti-Vichy spirit ofthe Free French will be hard to reconcile with the esteem in which the others holdMarshal Petain.5. It is difficult to assess the real feelings of the Free French on this complexmatter, but it can be said that, whatever they are. the fighting efficiency of their ships has not been affected.Successes.6. The corvette Aconit, on the 11th March, rammed a German Submarinewhich had been forced to the surface by depth charges from a British destroyerand took prisoners. A few hours later she attacked another submarine, which she also destroyed by ramming, again taking prisoners.7. The corvette Lobelia is credited with the probable destruction of a submarine on the 7th February.8. Two boats of the newly formed M.T.B. Flotilla attacked a 2,000-tonenemy Merchant Ship in the Channel, which is believed to have sunk.9. The submarine Junon carried out a successful operation off the norwegian coast.Ships Commissioned.10. Chasseurs Nos. 5 and 13, formerly British-manned, submarine Le Curie(P. 67), 3 motor launches in Canada, and 2 motor launches in the Levant.11. The destroyer Stevenstone, mentioned in the last report, will not betaken over by the Free French.Ships turned over to the Royal Navy.12. The battleship Courbet has been lent to the Royal Navy for use as a target ship and other experimental work.* 13. The submarines Orion and Ondine, which have not been in use sincecoming to this country in 1940, have been turned over for breaking up.Frenchmen in the Royal Navy.14. There has been no indication of any of the officers and men of Frenchnationality, who are still serving in the Royal Navy, wishing to join general giraud&apos;s&apos;s forces. On the contrary, it is believed that a number will avail them-selves of the opportunity of assuming British nationality if the necessary legislation (now before Parliament) is passed.15. H.M.S. Fidelity, the former French ship Rlvin, was lost near the Azoreson the 1st January.   With the exception of a motor-boat&apos;s crew-and two officers[253101 n 2
in a seaplane, who were away from the ship at the time, all her company are missing. This included her Commanding Officer, 9 officers and 20 ratings ofFrench nationality.16.   18 officers and 300 ratings remain in the Royal Navy.Polish Navy.17. There has been evidence that the Press Reports on the Polish-Russianpolitical controversy have disturbed the minds of Polish officers and men to aconsiderable extent.18. One incident has come to notice where some members of the crew of theKrakozviak, under the mistaken impression that they were under orders for north russia, protested to their Captain, but all passed oft&apos; smoothly.19. The dilution of the seven destroyers&apos; crews with newly joined men. whichis necessary for the formation of the Dragon&apos;s crew, will perhaps reduce thefighting efficiency of the*destroyers for a short time, but the keenness of the Poleswill undoubtedly overcome this as quickly as possible.Operations.20. The destroyer Krakowiak was in action with enemy E-boats in theChannel on the 4th March.21. The destrovers Orkan and Piorun have been operating with the home fleet.22.   The submarines Sokol and Dzik are proceeding to Malta.Ships Commissioned.23. The Poles took over H.M.S. Dragon on the loth January and put a care and maintenance party on board for the period of her refit. The question of changing her name has given rise to a situation of considerable difficulty, whichhas not yet been settled.Recruiting.24. The remainder of the men necessary to enable the Dragon to be corn-missioned have been received from the Polish Army. Negotiations are proceeding to obtain a further 300 men from this source. These are necessary to provide forcasualties and wastage in the existing fleet.Royal Netherlands Navy.25.   Morale and efficiency have been maintained at the previous high level.Successes.26. The submarine Dolfijn (P. 47), recently taken over from her builders inthis country, sank an Italian Submarine in the Mediterranean on the 8th February.27. Submarine O. 24 sank a 4,000-ton Japanese supply ship in the Straits ofMalacca.28.   Submarine O. 21 sank a 4,000-ton merchant ship off Port Blair.Losses.29. The submarine depot ship Colombia was torpedoed in the Indian Oceanon the 27th February.   Only 8 men out of her complement of 320 were lost.Ships Commissioned.30.   Five motor minesweepers.31. The corvette Carnation has been taken over from the Royal Navy and.renamed Frisco.Ships turned over to the Royal Navy.32. The escort vessel Jan van Gelder was given up in exchange for theCarnation.
Royal Norwegian Navy.33. Morale is excellent and all ships, including the Minesweepers, are carrying out their duties most satisfactorily.Successes wild Operations.34. The submarine Uredd torpedoed a German depot ship of the &quot; Saar &quot;Class in a Norwegian Fjord, on the 17th January and she is believed to have sunk.M.T.Bs. of the 30th Flotilla have several times been in action off the norwegian coast and have carried out various operations with success. A Ju. 88 was shot down. On one occasion, the 14th March, two Merchant ships of 10,000 and3,000 tons were sunk.Losses.35. The patrol vessel Bodo struck a mine on the 4th January. There were only 2 survivors.36. The submarine Uredd failed to return from an operation off theNorwegian coast and is presumed to have been lost about the 20th February.37. The patrol vessel Harstad was torpedoed on the 28th February. Therewas only one survivor.38. M.T.B. 631 struck a rock after torpedoing one of the merchant shipsmentioned above and had to be abandoned. All her crew were taken off by theother M.T.B. in company.Ships Commissioned.39.   M.L. 573.40.   M.T.B. 345 to replace 631 (lost) and M.T.B. 653.41. Submarine P. 66. renamed Ula, was taken over from her builders, inthe presence of His Majesty the King of Norway, on the 28th March.Ships turned over to the Royal Navy.42. The torpedo boat Draug, which is being used for training Fleet air arm personnel.Royal Navy (Section Beige).43. There has been a considerable improvement in recruiting owing to theaction of the Belgian Government using their powers under the Maritime courts act about 50 having been obtained.44.   The ships at present manned continue to operate satisfactorily.Royal Hellenic Navy.45. The morale of the men under training in this country has been satisfactory.46. Two &apos;&quot; Hunt &quot; Class destroyers completed their working up and left forthe Mediterranean during the last quarter. It is felt that when they have hada little more experience their crews will reach a satisfactory standard of efficiency.Successes.47. The destro)er Queen Olga, in company with two British destroyers,sank the Italian Corvette Stromboli in the Eastern Mediterranean.48. The destroyer Adrias, while on her way out from this country to theMediterranean, attacked an enemy submarine off the Liberian Coast and iscredited with its probable destruction.Ships Commissioned.49. The &quot;Hunt&quot; Class destroyer Bramham has been turned, over to the greeks and renamed Themistocles.Ships to be Commissioned.50.   The Submarine P. 71, now building, has been allocated.
51. President Roosevelt has presented a Submarine Chaser to the King of greece and she is to be taken over shortly in the United States.52. With the exception of the Braniham, it has not been&apos; Found possible to allocate any more Destroyers or Corvettes to the Creeks and. they are being offered a number of L.S.Ts. and Minesweepers building in the United States in order to absorb the personnel, numbering about 500, now training Or on their way to thiscountry.  Their acceptance of these craft is awaited.PART  II.-ALLIED  ARMY  CONTINGENTS.General Remarks by /he Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.53. The reorganisation of the Allied Contingents, to fit them better for operations with the Allied Armies on the Continent of Europe and for futureexpansion of their National Armies, continues.54. The Norwegian. Belgian and Netherlands Contingents are now fullvreorganised and equipped as Independent Infantry Companies with supportingarms to enable them to carry out the operational roles indicated by theCommander-in-Chief. Home Forces. Preliminary training in the new organisa-tion is proceeding, and the Commander-in-Chief has arranged for attachments,for training, of all Units of these Allied Contingents to British Units andformations. These attachments will undoubtedly produce an improvement in thestandard of training, and will be popular with the Allies. The strengths of theseContingents ate. in every ease, below War Establishment. Recruits continue toarrive from various parts of the world, but the present rate of reinforcement isonly sufficient to bring about a very small increase in strength.55. A measure of reorganisation is in progress in the Polish Corps.Reinforcements have arrived from the Middle East and elsewhere, and some-additional 2.0(H) men are en route. This will not suffice to bring the existingformations up to strength, and to enable the older men. some of whom are not fitto be retained in fighting Units, to be transferred to more sedentary work, inorder to improve the present situation, it lias been decided to reduce the Indepen-dent Infantry Brigade Group to a Cadre of officers. n.c.os. and specialists, and totransfer the balance to the Armoured Division. The Polish Corps will consistof a Corps Headquarters. Corps troops, one (old-mode!) Armoured Division, a parachute Brigade and a Cadrerised Infantry Brigade capable of rapid, expansionto a Division. The provision of equipment for the Polish Corps is proceeding satisfactorily.56. The Czechoslovak Government have submitted proposals for there organisation of their Contingent to form an Army Tank Brigade with supporting arms. Some 1.600 of their troops are being released from the middle east, and with these reinforcements their numbers will suffice to provide anArmy Tank Brigade Group. The older men will be grouped into a Defence&apos;Company, and a 10 per cent, reserve, to replace battle casualties, provided. the czechoslovak proposals are now under consideration by the War Office.57. All the Allied Defence Ministries are, not unnaturally, devoting moreand more attention to planning the future organisation of their armies, and to considering the defence problems they expect to arise on the reoccupation of theirown countries.58. All the Allied Contingents have a surplus of officers to a varied degree,and the Adjutant-General to the Forces lias now under consideration proposalsfor the attachment of suitable Allied officers for extended periods to british units.59. Officers and other ranks from all the Contingents have attended Coursesat the Allied Special Training Centre, Inverlochy. which continues to providevaluable instruction, particularly for the smaller Contingents.60. The morale of all the Contingents remains high. The strain of thelong period of inaction is borne with remarkable patience, in spite of theundiminishecl anxiety for the well-being of their families and friends in theirown countries. There have been the usual minoi political difficulties in thePolish and Belgian Contingents, but there are no indications that these will increase
French Forces.Establishment and Organisation,.61. There are no fixed establishments. The military personnel are dividedinto Services Generaux, a &quot; Groupe Mixte &quot; (trained fighting men and recruits)and a Parachute Unit.62. In addition, there is a troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando in wales.Strength and Location. Officers.   Other Ranks.63.   Old Dean Common Camp, Camberley ... ...      60            37964. There are also 36 officers and 175 other ranks Air Force personnelaccommodated at the camp.Special Points regarding Training.65. The Escadron Mixte returned from a two-months&apos; attachment to the5th Canadian Armoured Division early in February, and in the middle of March,accompanied by the Batterie Tractee, left Camberley for service overseas.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.66. The training of the Free French Forces is of an elementary nature andthe most valuable element of it lies in the attachments to British Units and coursesat British Schools. Recruits and reinforcements continue to arrive in this country from France and elsewhere.   When trained, drafts are sent to the Middle East.Polish Forces.Establishment. Officers.

The Poles also have a troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando,located in Wales.71. About 1,500 men of the Infantry Brigade are being transferred tohelp bring the Armoured Division up to strength, some reinforcements for whichare expected shortly from overseas to complete establishment.Command.72. Major-General Boruta-Spiechowicz relinquished command of the1st Polish Army Corps in the middle of March. He will be succeeded by major-General Zajac, now second-in-command to General Anders in the middle east. Meanwhile, Major-General Maczek, the Armoured Divisional Com-mander, is Acting Corps Commander.Special Points regarding Training.73. Training in the Armoured Division has been confined to Unit training,and the training of specialists. Units were short of their establishment of tanks and wireless equipment. The situation has recently been much improved andthe deficiencies in equipment are now relatively small.74. A variety of exercises and study days have been held. A considerablenumber of Polish officers have attended British Army Schools, and attachmentshave been arranged to British formations. The Poles have a number of schoolsof thei r own including a Staff College.

The Armoured Division has now reached a standard of training andequipment to enable it, and to make it desirable for it, to take part in highertraining. The facilities in Scotland for higher training are limited, and theintention of the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, is, if possible, to move the armoured Division to another area in the South for some months this Summer.70. The Parachute Brigade is to be expanded to a strength of about,000 by reinforcements expected to arrive from the Middle East during thenext few months. This Brigade is assisted in its training&apos; by the BritishAirborne Division.Dutch Forces.Establishment. Officers.     Other Ranks.77. 203 1.709Strength and Location.78.

In addition to the above, the Dutch have a troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied)Commando located in Wales.Special Points regarding Training.81. No collective or higher training has been possible during the last threemonths, as the Dutch have been engaged in reorganising their Contingent from  Battalions and an Armoured Car Squadron to the organisation shown inparagraph 79 above.82. The Field Artillery Troop has now been attached for training to one ofour Field Regiments.83. The Reconnaissance Unit has recently completed field firing at BlackMountain Range.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with A Hied Contingents.84. The reorganisation of the Contingent is complete, as is the equipment in all essentials.85. The Contingent has been too long in its comfortable camp at Wolver-hampton, and the decision of the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, to have the princess Irene Brigade attached to British Units cannot fail to produce good results. The majority of the officers and men are anxious to take part in morestrenuous and realistic collective training.

In addition, the Norwegians have a Company in Iceland and a troop ofNo. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, located in Wales.Special Points regarding Training.90. The comparative absence of snow during the past winter has greatlylimited the training of Mountain Companies.91. To improve the standard in the Norwegian Signal Sections, vacancieswere allotted on courses within the Scottish Command.92. In the middle of February the Parachute Company returned from anattachment to our Airborne Division and went on to a Snow and Ski School atGrantown.   They have recently rejoined the Contingent.Aid to the Civil Power.93. The Contingent supplied working parties continuously for ten days inJanuary to bury carcases and clean and disinfect sheds and stables as a result of alocal outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease. The demand was originally madeowing to the refusal of local civilian labour to carry out this unpleasant task.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.94. The reorganization of the Contingent is now complete, as is the equip-ment. The training of the Independent Companies is proceeding satisfactorilyand the ponies for pack and draught transport are now well broken. In the nearfuture the Companies will be attached to British Units for collective training.Belgian Forces.Establishment. Officers Other Ranks.95. ...      ............. 174 2,100Strength.96.

In addition to the above, the Belgians have a troop in No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando in Wales; and a General Duties Company at Wimbledon(Company of Invalids).[25310]
99. At the end of January the Belgians reorganized their 1st Battalioninto three Independent Companies and the 2nd Battalion into an AdministrativeCompany and an Instruction Company, &quot;B&quot; Company of the 2nd Battalionbecoming an Independent Parachute Company.100. A fortnight previously, after a three months&apos; attachment to the49th Division, the Field Battery and 1st Battalion moved to Clacton preparatoryto taking over an operational role in the Lowestoft Area, vacated by the Ozeeho-slovak Brigade. The Armoured Car Squadron joined the 1st Belgian Group inthe Lowestoft Area at the beginning of March, after a. two months&apos; attachmentto the Household Cavalry Armoured Car Regiment.Special Points regarding Training.101. Early in February the Armoured Car Squadron took part in anexercise with the Guards Armoured Division.102. On the 21st March an exercise for the 1st Group was held at theOrford Battle Practice Range.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.103. There is no doubt that much good will arise from the move of thefighting portion of the Contingent to the East Coast, where it has the operationalrole of the defence of Lowestoft sector. Good training facilities exist in this area.The reorganisation of the Contingent into Independent Companies is complete and training is proceeding satisfactorily.104.

In February the Brigade took part in a Corps Skeleton Exercise,taking the part of a Divisional Headquarters with the object of testingcommunication.Note by Chief IAaison Officer with A Hied Contingents.111. The Brigade welcomes its operational role at Harwich and to feel thatit may have an opportunity of acting offensively against the Germans.112. The reorganisation of the Brigade into an Army Tank Brigade with supporting arms is under consideration.
PART III.-ALLIED AIR CONTINGENTS.General Notes.Morale. , *113. Subject to qualifications in the case of a very few units, morale in theAllied Air Forces remains remarkably high.Training.114. In United Kingdom and in Canada basic aircrew training has proceeded satisfactorily.115. No difficulty has been encountered in finding space for Allied personnel in Schools of Technical Training Command.116. Operational training in the United Kingdom is also proceedingsmoothly. The reorganisation of the Polish Bomber Squadrons in bomber command will necessitate a considerable reduction in O.T.U. capacity for Poles,and arrangements are being made to convert No. 18 (Polish) O.T.U. into a normalf-size British O.T.U. in which a Polish Flight, national in character, will beincluded.117. Arrangements are being made fur Dutch Mitchell crews to receiveoperational training in Canada, and the question of giving Czech Liberatorcrews operational training in the Bahamas is receiving attention.118. In Southern Rhodesia the training of Allies, nearly all Greeks andYugoslavs, is now urganised. A programme has been drawn up to ensure that the flow of pilots is phased to meet the replacement and / or planned expansion require-ments of the Royal Hellenic and the Royal Yugoslav Air Forces. The training ofother categories of aircrew, when this cannot be carried out in Rhodesian Schools,is being arranged in Schools of the Union of South Africa, where also Main-tenance tradesmen are being trained.119. Reference is made later in this report to the training of Belgians ofthe &quot; Force Publique &quot; in South African establishments.Teaching of English.120. The United Kingdom Air Liaison Mission in Canada has reportedthat a large number of Allied pupils sent to the Dominion for basic training knowinsufficient English to absorb instruction in the time allowed in the syllabus.While every effort has been, and will be, made to improve their standard of Englishbefore they leave this country, it is being impressed on all those responsible forteaching that, with our Allies, more time, more imagination and more effort will always be necessary than is normally demanded with British pupils. Teachingthose who do not naturally speak our language calls for a special technique, whichInstructors must endeavour to acquire. In United Kingdom Schools, andrecently in those of the Rhodesian Air Training Group, it has been possible toensure that some organised lessons in basic English are included in the syllabi ofall courses, and in addition facilities exist, and are being increased, for Alliedpersonnel to improve their knowledge in their spare time. It has always beenAir Ministry policy to persevere with suitable Allied personnel who make a.genuine attempt to master our language. His Majesty&apos;s Government has enteredinto agreements with Allied Governments to assist in all ways possible to maintainAllied Squadrons by training their personnel. The importance of English as alingua franca of the air needs no stressing. Operating, as they must, with theR.A.F., Allied officers and airmen who cannot become reasonably proficient in itwill always be less well equipped than those who can.Free French Air Force.Operations (see Battle Order : Appendix II).121. No. 340 Squadron in Fighter Command carried out 593 sorties duringthe period under review. No. 341 (Alsace) Squadron which formed in january and became operational at the close of the quarter, has carried out two sorties and has now taken the place of No. 340 Squadron at Biggin Hill. No. 340Squadron will rest at turn house after an active tour in which it destroyed29 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 2 and damaged 30.[25310] c 2
Re-equipment.122. No. 342 (Lorraine) Squadron is shortly to reform on Boston aircraft.As originally planned, only half the maintenance personnel of this squadron and of the Alsace Squadron were to have been French, but now all French groundpersonnel available will be allotted to the former, the ground personnel of thelatter being entirely British.Morale.123. The morale of the Squadrons in Fighter Command has been goodthroughout; that of the pilots of the Lorraine Squadron has improved with theprospect of operating on Boston aircraft. .  .Genm-al.124. Commandant de Mozay has been sent to North Africa as Air Memberof General Catroux&apos;s Mission to General Giraud.&quot; Giraud &quot; French Air Force.125. It has been agreed that the R.A.F. Target Force planned for north africa shall comprise two Squadrons manned by personnel of the AeronautiqueMaritime, one to be equipped with 10 Wellington XI and one with 9 Sunderlandaircraft. Already over 220 French Naval aircrew personnel, including a fewtechnicians, have reached the United Kingdom for operational training in orderthat in about three months&apos; time they may ferry their aircraft to West Africa.126. As an interim measure 4 Hudson and 2 Sunderland aircraft have beenmade available in West Africa for the training of, and then for operation by.French crews.Polish Air Force.Operations (see Battle Order :  Appendix II).127. In Bomber Command the 3 Polish Squadrons have throughout theperiod, owing to shortage of trained crews, been operating on a low aircraft establishment of 10 + 2 Wellingtons. They carried out 301 sorties againstLorient, Hamburg. Cologne. Wilhelmshaven, St. Nazaire and Essen. In26 operations 118 mines were laid in enemy waters. In February No. 305Squadron was first in the Group Monthly Ladder for bombing photographs,having been third in January.128. In Fighter Command, aircraft of the 7 Polish &quot; Day &quot; fighter squadrons and one Polish &quot;Night&quot; Fighter Squadron operated for over ,740 hours and destroyed 10 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 11 and damaged 4.129. In Coastal Command No, 304 (Polish) Squadron made 180 sorties on anti-submarine patrol, convoy escort, anti-shipping strikes and raids on the docks at Bordeaux.130. Two actions are particularly worthy of note. The first on the5th January. 1943, when in the Bay of Biscay one aircraft attacked two U-boats in line astern. They dived but within 30 seconds three depth charges had been dropped by the aircraft and these exploded about 10 yards ahead of the swirlof the leading boat. One U-Boat surfaced and the centre of three more depth charges exploded 5 yards off the conning-tower, bringing a large patch of oil tothe surface.131. The second on the 9th February, 1943, when another aircraft was attacked in the Bay of Biscay by 4 Ju. 88s, two coming from the port and twofrom the starboard beam. The captain with his Wellington^ port wing damagedjettisoned his bombs and depth charges then attacked two of the enemy from deadastern getting in a long burst of fire. Eight times the enemy attacked singlyand then one left the fight. The three remaining yet again attacked, two fromthe port and one from the starboard. During one of these attacks a cannonshell exploded in the Wellington injuring the front gunner and the second pilot.The aircraft was hit many times. The whole action lasted 58 minutes. Despitea hole some 2 yards in diameter in the aircraft&apos;s port wing and other damage the pilot brought his wounded comrades safely home.
132. In Army Co-operation Command No. 309 (Polish) Squadron flew over40 hours on convoy protection, and on training flights over 780 hours. On the1st March, 1943, the Squadron was reduced from three Flights to a normal twoFlight Fighter Reconnaissance Squadron, both of. which were equipped withMustang aircraft.Reorganisation and formation of Operational Squadrons.133. At the close of the Quarter, No. 300 Squadron was being brought up to full strength on 16 -f 2 Wellington aircraft; No. 301 Squadron was with-drawn and placed on a &quot; number only &quot; basis and it was decided that No. 305Squadron should at once be reduced to an aircraft establishment of 8 i 1Wellingtons until it could be re-formed as a full Squadron on 16 -t- 2 Mosquitoaircraft when it will be transferred to No. 2 Group.134. A small Polish element (flying personnel only) has for some time been operating with No. 138 Squadron, equipped with four-engine bomber aircraft forspecial duty. This element has now been increased to seven crews. In the nearfuture, these crews will be organised as a Flight which will also compriseappropriate Polish Maintenance personnel.135. No. 309 (Polish) Squadron which consisted of 2 Lysander Flights andone Mustang Flight, has been reorganised as a normal Army Co-operation FighterReconnaissance Squadron (2 Flights) and armed with 12 + 2 Mustang aircraft.136. A new Fighter Reconnaissance Squadron (No. 318 Polish) started toform towards the end of the period partly with personnel surplus to the require-ments of No. 309 Squadron. It will train under the direction of army co-operation Command and is destined for transfer to Middle East Command ona Ioav order of priority where it will operate on Hurricane aircraft.137. A third Flight, which may not be permanent, has been added toNo. 145 Fighter Squadron (Spitfires) in the Middle P^ast, to man which the polish air Force has sent out all the pilots. These are experienced Fighter Pilots whowere supernumerary to the establishments of Polish Fighter Squadrons in theUnited Kingdom.Balloon Command.138. A Polish Flight was formed as far back as May 1941 in No. 945Squadron, and transferred to No. 929 Squadron in August 1942, taking over thearea North-East of the Forth Bridge which includes Queensferry, Inverkeithingand Donnibristle and comprises 12 sites. During the last six months, Flightswere invariably operated with punctuality, speed and precision.M or ale.139. Reports from Command Headquarters are as follows : bomber command &apos;&quot; Generally good &quot;; Fighter Command &quot; Very good throughout &quot;&apos;;Coastal Command Of a high order &quot; ; Army Co-operation Command &quot; very good&quot;; Balloon Command Very high.&quot;140. Headquarters, Coastal Command, add that Polish flying discipline in 304 Squadron calls for improvement, but add that, in comparison with theamount of flying carried out, the accident rate has been low.Staff College.141. A Polish Air Force Staff College, with appropriate instructional staffunder a Group Captain Commandant, has been established within the polish army Staff College in Scotland.   Courses for 20 pupils will last eight months.Scheme for Training Polish Aircraft Apprentices.142. It has been agreed in principle to bring to the United Kingdom fromthe Middle East 300 Polish boys for training as aircraft apprentices.Scheme for General Education.143. In order to improve the general standard of education in the polish air Force, a number of Polish Officers (one Squadron Leader, one FlightLieutenant and twenty-five Flying Officers) have been appointed to give instruc-tion.   The R.A.F. Education Service is giving all assistance in its power.
Royal Dutch Naval Air Service.Operations (see Order of Battle, Appendix II).147. No. 320 (Dutch) Squadron, operating with Coastal Command, made,in the period up to the 15th March. 197 sorties to attack enemy shipping andoccasionally assisted in air/sea rescue. The Squadron claims direct hits on a tanker, 3 freighters and 3 miscellaneous vessels, representing a total tonnage ofabout 14,500 tons, all off the Dutch Coast.148. No official report has been received about No. 321 (Dutch) Squadronbased in Ceylon. The Assistant Air Officer in Charge of Administration, AirHeadquarters. India, wrote privately, however, on the 10th February, aftervisiting the Squadron, that &quot;Morale seems to be high,&quot; that the Squadron&quot; seemed to be well off as regards aircraft,&quot; and that it had &quot; far too many pilots and not enough ground staff&quot;; but adds &quot; they certainly seem to do wonderswith the few men that they have got for maintenance.&quot; The Station Commander,he says, reported most favourably on the unit, stating he had only one trouble,namely, to persuade the Dutch that thev &quot; must shave in the morning and not at night!&quot;Re-equipment.149. No. 320 (Dutch) Squadron was transferred from Coastal to bomber command on the 15th March, 1943. where it is re-equipping with Mitchellaircraft for operations in No. 2 Group.Morale.150. Coastal Command assess morale as &quot; good to very good,&quot; adding thatin the light of the satisfactory results on operations, it may be accepted as aboveaverage.151. One instance of good morale is noteworthy. A pilot, when both hisengines had been set on fire by anti-aircraft shells, managed to regain controland brought his aircraft safely to base.Recruiting.152. The flow of recruits from enemy-occupied territories has almostceased. Small numbers are, however, &apos;from time to time transferred to the naval air Services from the Netherlands Navy.Royal Dutch Army Aviation  (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations.153. A Dutch Fighter Squadron is expected to form during the next fewweeks. During the period under review, eight Dutch pilots serving in No. 167Squadron flew on operations about 470 hours, destroying one enemy aircraft,probably destroying another.Morale.154.Morale remains high.Recruiting.144. Of the 2,000 recruits for the Polish Air Force coming from the PolishLand Army in the Middle East (see paragraph 101 of the previous report),37 officers and 567 airmen have reached the United Kingdom.Time Promotion.145. The promotion of Polish G.D. officers to the rank of Flight Lieutenantafter two years&apos; satisfactory service has been approved.Policy.146. The draft of a new Anglo-Polish agreement in a form acceptable tothe Air Ministry and to the Inspectorate-General of the Polish Air Force is about to be submitted to the Polish Prime Minister for his final examination.
Recruiting.155. Recruits at the rate of 10 a month have entered aircrew trainingduring the quarter, and 84 have been sent to Technical Schools to qualify asMaintenance,personnel for the Dutch Tighter Squadron forming this Spring.Royal Norwegian Air Force.Operations.   (See Battle Order : Appendix II.)156. In Fighter Command, No. 331 and 332 (Norwegian) Squadrons haveflown on operations during the period of a total of 1,700 hours, destroying20 enemy aircraft, probably destroying 7\ and damaging 23.157. Although the main part of 330 (Norwegian) Squadron in coastal command has been out of the line re-equipping since its return to this country from Iceland, the detachment armed with Northrop Float planes still in Icelandhas made 24 sorties escorting convoys and patrolling against submarines, andon fighter patrol and transport duty.M orale.158. Fighter Command report that morale is exceedingly high. coastal command state that the morale of the Flight in Iceland is good, though lack of operational opportunity has to some extent had an adverse effect. The aircrewsare keen and maintenance work has been of a high standard. Some signs ofstress have been noticed as a result of the difficult conditions under whichmaintenance work has to be done.Re-organisation.159. 330 (Norwegian) Squadron&apos;s establishment of aircraft has been increased from 6 + 9 to 9 + 3 Sunderlands.160. The Flight in Iceland is shortly to be brought to this country when itwill surrender its Northrop Float planes. The personnel will be absorbed intothe Sunderland Squadron.New Formation.161. On the 17th February a Norwegian element in No. 18 Group was formed as No. 1477 (Norwegian) Flight armed with 3 + 0 Catalina aircraft.Recruiting.162. Recruiting is now mainly dependent upon the Norwegians who canbe brought out of Sweden by air, though a small number of recruits are stillcoming forward in Canada and the United States.The Belgian Air Force (R.A.F.V.R.).Operations.163. In Fighter Command No. 350 Belgian Squadron flew a total of442 hours on operations destroying 1 enemy aircraft and probably destroyinganother.Morale.164.   Fighter Command report that morale has been very good throughout.No. 349 Belgian Fighter Squadron.165. Difficulties have been experienced with the supply of replacementaircraft and of Belgian personnel for this Squadron formed on Tomahawks in nigeria (see paragraph 119 of the previous report). These difficulties and the changed strategic position following the progress of the war in North Africahave led to a suggestion that this Squadron should be brought back to the UnitedKingdom, where any Belgian personnel, flying and ground, that become availablecan the more readily be posted to it.   No decision on this has yet been reached.Operational Employment of Trained Belgian A ircrew Personnel.166. It is becoming increasingly difficult to employ individual Belgians inotherwise British crews, and proposals are under examination for giving certain categories additional training to enable completely Belgian crews to be offered toOperational Commands at home.
167. Subject to certain conditions which it is believed the Belgian Govern-meht will accept, Bomber and Fighter Commands are prepared to absorb during1943 up to 20 crews each and Coastal Command up to 6.Belgian Congo as a possible source of Supply of Personnel.168. In 1941 it was agreed to accept for training in the Union of SouthAfrica a number of young Belgians of the &quot; Force Publique,&quot; a condition beingimposed that when trained these Belgians should be liable for service anywherewith the R.A.F. (or possibly S.A.A.F.) should the Congo Government not be ableto employ them as air personnel through lack of aircraft. About 100 aircrew,mainly single-engine pilots, are already trained, about 100 are still in aircrewschools and about 85 are under trade training for aircraft maintenance.169. There appears to be some difficulty in persuading the CongoAuthorities to abide by the conditions governing the acceptance of these airmenfor training, but negotiations are proceeding locally on a service level.170. It is hoped that a satisfactory arrangement will shortly be reached thatwill enable these young airmen to be given active employment, particularly inNo. 349 Squadron, which might then become Belgian in fact as well as in name.Morale amongst these Belgians who have completed their basic training and find themselves unemployed is fast deteriorating.-Czechoslovak Air Force (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations (see Order of Battle : Appendix II).171. In Coastal Command No. 311 (Czech) Squadron has carried out in the quarter year 169 sorties on anti-submarine patrol, convoy escort, anti-shippingstrikes and a raid on the Docks at Bordeaux. During the last 3 weeks aloneaircraft of the Squadron flew 570 hours.172. The Squadron was instrumental in helping to salvage a damaged and abandoned British tanker sighted on the 29th December, 1942.173. On the night of the 18th/19th March, 1 aircraft attacked 2 enemy merchant ships in the Bay of Biscay and 1 of 3 bombs dropped burst close to theport beam of 1 ship.174. In Fighter Command the 3 Czechoslovak &quot; Day&quot; Fighter Squadronsflew a total of 2.509 hours by day and 7 by night, destroying 2 enemy aircraft,probably destroying 1 and damaging 3.Morale. .175. Coastal Command report that No. 311 Squadron has carried out its duties extremely well and that its accident rate has been exceptionally low.176. Fighter Command report that morale in the Czech Fighter Squadronsis very good throughout.Re-equipment.177. It has been decided that No. 311 Squadron shall be re-equipped with12 + 3 Liberator aircraft probably in the summer of 1943. It will remain in coastal Command.Recruiting.178. 12 airmen have been transferred from the Czechoslovak Army orenlisted from civil life and 10 have been recruited in Canada. The personneltransferred from the Czechoslovak Armed Force in the Middle East for service with the Czechoslovak Air Force in the United Kingdom (see para, 124 of previous report) consisted of 18 officers and 149 airmen of whom 17 officers and. SOairmen have already reached the Initial Training Wing stage of aircrew training.The Royal Hellenic Air Force.Operations (see Battle Order : Appendix II).179. No. 355 (Greek) Fighter Squadron and No. 13 (Greek) general reconnaissance Squadron have been operating throughout the period in theMiddle East.
Expansion.180. No. 356 (Greek) Fighter Squadron, formed in the Middle east command in the middle of February on 16 Hurricane lie aircraft. It becameoperational on the 1st April.181. There is a possibility that a second. Greek General reconnaissance squadron will be formed in the second half of 1943, and the necessary personnel are being trained in Southern Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa. the target strength of the R.H.A.F., which has been accepted in principle, is a totalof 5 Squadrons 3 Fighter and 2 General Reconnaissance.Morale.182.    Morale is reported to be satisfactory.General.183. All outstanding difficulties between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theRoyal Hellenic Government in respect of the revised draft of Appendix IV* tothe Anglo-Greek Forces Agreement have now been resolved.Royal Yugoslav Air Force.Operations.184. Xo Yugoslav personnel have been employed in operations during thisquarter.Development.185. It is hoped shortly to form a Yugoslav Fighter Flight in Middle east command, and 164 men have been transferred to the Air Force from the YugoslavBattalion at Haifa as ground personnel for this Flight. They are undergoingtraining in Middle East.Morale.186. Yugoslav personnel in maintenance units of Middle East Command are reported to be working very satisfactorily, and no complaints have been received of the morale of those in schools in Southern Rhodesia.General.187. Lieutenant-Colonel Skrivanic arrived in the Middle East in february to take up the position of Chief of the Inspectorate.188. All suitable trained Yugoslav aircrew are now being employed in an aircraft Delivery Unit in Middle East Command.189. Those destined for the Yugoslav Fighter Flight who require furhertraining are being given this in the Middle East.* Not reproduced.[25310]D
