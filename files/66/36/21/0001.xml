Promising attacks were carried out by aircraft in the S.W. approaches and east of Newfoundland. In the Pacific, two Japanese U-boats were probably damaged by U.S. ships.Enemy Intelligence.German.8. Photographic reconnaissance on the 20th showed that the Graf Zeppelin-had left Kiel.
The rate of U-boat construction is considered to have risen from 20 to 25 amonth.  Recruiting for the U-boat service is expanding.Italian.9. Traffic to Tunisia increased by 7,000 tons and two destroyers loaded with german troops are reported to have reached Tunis.Japanese.10. The tonnage of merchant shipping in Rabaul has decreased by approxi-mately 70,000 tons.An aerial reconnaissance of Kavieng showed a damaged heavy cruiser of theA storage class.U-boats.11. The force of U-boats operating in the Atlantic continues at about 100,half of which are on the northern convoy routes. There is activity off Freetown.U-boats are believed to be bound for South Africa, and one is operating south-east of Durban.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. During the week ending midnight the 18th, 971 ships were convoyed.Of these 214 were in ocean convoys and 757 in British coastal convoys, 77destroyers (including 16 U.S. destroyers), 115 sloops, cutters, corvettes andfrigates (including one U.S. cutter), three armed merchant cruisers and one escortcarrier were employed on escort duties.During the same period 89 ships in three ocean convoys arrived in home waters.   Three ships were sunk.13. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy, during the weekending the 17th, totalled 577,000 tons compared with 858,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 623,100 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 196,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.14. During the week eight ships were torpedoed by U-boats and four ofthese are known to have sunk.In attacks on two outward-bound Atlantic convoys Iavo ships were sunk andanother was torpedoed. One ship was sunk and another torpedoed in homeward-bound Atlantic convoys. One ship in convoy was torpedoed off Oran.

MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map of the Tunis Area is included as an inset.)Tunisia.First A rmy.18. In the northern sector the main activity continued to be in theMed jez-el - Bab-Munchar-Be j a area. The going has been difficult in hillycountry, where pack transport is necessary for bringing up supplies. british infantry were engaged in fierce lighting for possession of the important hillsthat lie to the north of Medjez-el-Bab. Throughout the 15th a confused struggletook place for Djebel Ang, which, after attack and counter-attack, finallyremained in our hands. The following night our infantry made a successful attack on Djebel Tanngouche, one mile to the north of Heiclous. We were latercompelled to withdraw when our mule transport bringing forward tools and supplies was destroyed.Further north some slight progress was made astride the Beja-Mateur road.US. infantry, having regrouped after their operations in the south, took overthe northernmost sector of First Army from the area of Ston de Nsir up to thecoast.   Since their arrival they have carried out patrol activity only.During the night 20th/21st the enemy attacked our positions betweenMedjez-el-Bab and Goubellat at a strength of three infantry battalions supportedby upwards of 70 tanks. The enemy at first made some headway, but afterconfused fighting we succeeded in repelling his attacks. Early on the 21st thearea was reported clear except for a small force of tanks and infantry, which was later driven back. During this engagement we destroyed 25 enemy tanks and took at least 450 prisoners.The French have continued to clear the hills that lie between the right flank of First Army and the left flank of Eighth Army. South-west of Djebel Mansoursome local advances have been made. Fierce fighting has occurred east of DjehelChirich, during the course of which some 500 prisoners were taken.Eighth Army.19. Once the enemy has reached his defensive positions in the areaEnfidaville-Djebihina a temporary halt was called to General Montgomery^northward advance. Patrol contact wras maintained while the bulk of our forces moved up in preparation for the next big attack which went in late onthe 19th. Some very stiff fighting took place in the initial stages of the attack,but Enfidaville itself was quickly occupied and a general advance of some three miles was made, wmich took us up the coast road towards Bou Ficha and inlandsecured us some important high ground. The enemy stubbornly opposed ouradvance with many counter-attacks, all of which we successfully repulsed. Weinflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and by the 20th had taken some 800prisoners.The Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Central Sectors.20. There have been no operations except for slight local activity on the leningrad front.Donetz Sector.21. The Germans have continued their efforts to drive the Russians fromtheir bridgeheads on the west bank of the Donetz, but their attacks have sofar been unsuccessful.Taman Bridgehead.22. On the northern flank of the bridgehead there has been some Russianpressure, but activity here is greatly hindered by the marshy nature of theground, which is at present under water.In the southern part of the bridgehead the Russians have renewed then-attacks, but after heavy fighting have made only slight progress.South of Novorossisk, where the Russians hold a small bridgehead, fightinghas been renewed, and the Germans have launched attacks, supported by strongair forces, on the Russian positions; so far, however, with no important results.
Summary.23. It has been a quiet week and, except in the Taman Peninsula, thefighting has been of only local importance.Burma.A arakan-.24. Further readjustments in our positions on the Mayu Peninsula havetaken place and our troops are now holding a line covering Buthidaung/Maungdaw. The Japanese do not appear to have pressed our withdrawal, butthey have occupied several villages south of our new positions. On both sides of the Mayu River fighting is at present limited to active patrolling.Chindivin A rea.25. There has been increased enemy activity in the area of Paungbyin(35 miles east-north-east of Tamu) during the last few days.AIR SITUATION.General Review.26. Aircraft of Bomber Command made heavy attacks on Mannheim,Stettin and Spezia.U.S. heavy bombers of the VIIIth  Air Force attacked Bremen, Brest andLorient,Intruder operations by aircraft of Fighter Command resulted in damage toa large number of trains and locomotives.Allied Air Forces have maintained a high scale of effort in Tunisia, and heavy attacks have been made on ports and airfields in Sicily and Sardinia.Enemy shipping in the Pacific Zone has again been effectively attacked by .S. aircraft.United Kingdom.27. In daylight 25 enemy aircraft flew overland; one Ju. 88 which crossed the East coast at 30.000 feet was destroyed by Spitfires.At night 17 aircraft, probably all fighter-bombers, operated overland; on one night two F.W. 190s crashed and two force-landed, one of which landed intacton a R.A.F. airfield. In addition, 10 long-range bombers carried out a raid onAberdeen.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.28. U.S. heavy bombers were despatched on two days of the week, the firstoperation being directed against the port areas of Brest and Lorient which, in good weather, were attacked by 17 escorted Liberators (B. 24) and 52 Fortresses(B. 17) respectively. The bombing at both places was reported as &quot; fair.&apos;&apos; Fourbombers were lost, seven enemy aircraft being destroyed and a further sevenprobably destroyed. The target for the second operation was the Focke-Wulfaircraft factory at Bremen, at which 100 Fortresses (B. 17) dropped 223 tons ofH.E. in conditions of moderate visibility. The bombing is considered to havebeen &quot;fair to good&quot; and results, from photographs, are referred to inAppendix VI. Intense flak over the target succeeded in breaking up the forma -tion, after which enemy fighters came in to attack. Of the 115 Fortressesdespatched, 16 are missing, but 63 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 15 probably destroyed and 17 damaged.Eleven operations rried out by escorted Venturas (B. 34) and, of the132 aircraft despatched, 91 per cent, attacked their targets. Two attacks weremade on the whale oil factory ship Solglimt and a merchantman, both in drydocks at Cherbourg, and it is possible that both ships were hit. From the bombing of the chemical works at Ostend, bursts were seen across the centre of the works with two hits on a gas-compressor house. At Zeebrugge where two attacks were made on the coke ovens, the target was again straddled with probable hits on[25337j b 2
the power station and the benzol plant. Apart from an attack on shipping atDieppe, from which no specific results are reported, the remaining targets wererailway centres and workshops, and these were bombed at Haarlem, Caen,Boulogne and Abbeville (twice). At Caen, the yard from the railway sidings to the engine sheds was straddled and other bursts were seen near the power stationwhilst, at Boulogne, hits were made on the north-west end of the yards and on asteel-rolling mill nearby. At Abbeville, bombs were seen to fall across the enginesheds, railway centre and on the tracks. Three Venturas were lost on these operations.Seven bombing attacks were made on enemy airfields by escorted Typhoonbombers, five of these being directed against Tricqueville and the other two against Poix and Courtrai respectively. Most bombs fell on the target areasbut no resultant damage could be seen except at Courtrai, where about 14 hits were made on the main hangars and buildings. Two Typhoon bombers were lost.The power station at Yainville was also, attacked by Typhoon bombers and mayhave been damaged by near misses.Cover, support and diversionary sweeps in connection with all the aboveoperations were flown by 121 squadrons of Spitfires, 10 squadrons of Typhoonsand 13 squadrons of U.S. Thunderbolts (P. 47); in combat. 11 enemy aircraftwrere destroyed, three probably destroyed and six damaged for the loss of eight ofour fighter^. Five other sweeps involving 17 squadrons of U.S. Thunderbolts(P. 47) and seven squadrons of Spitfires resulted in the destruction of three more,enemy fighters for the loss of three Thunderbolts (P. 47).Night.29. Bomber Command aircraft operated on two nights against the followingland objectives :  AttackedAircraft Primary TonnageDespatched.       Target.        of Bombs.        Missing.

Numerous fires were started in the vicinity. Visibility at Mannheim, which was attacked on the samenight. wras good and visual identification of the rivers Rhine and Neckar assistedmany crews in confirming their position. Many fires were seen spread over an area of about five square miles, with concentrations in the centre of Mannheimitself and to the north and south of Ludwigshafen (on the opposite bank of the rhine), where fires had a strong hold with smoke rising to 10,000 feet (see alsoAppendix VI).A well concentrated attack on the town of Stettin was achieved as a resultof excellent visibility and the accurate placing of marker bombs. Fires in the later stages- of the attack appeared to cover the whole town and were particularlyintense in the dock area. Many of these were still seen to be burning by the pilot of a photographic reconnaissance Spitfire, operating over Stettin on thefollowing day, who also reported the centre of the town to be completely obscuredby a pall of smoke. At Rostock, conditions were not so favourable, the goodweather being largely offset by an effective smoke screen operating over theHeinkel aircraft works, which was the primary target. As a result few crewsclaim to have identified the works and several bombed the alternative target ofthe town, from which smoke was still rising on the following day, whenphotographs were taken (see Appendix VI). On the same night as these two attacks, nine Mosquitoes bombed Berlin under most favourable conditions. of several fires started in the city, one appeared to be obtaining a firm hold, and on every large flash was seen in the Wilmersdorf area.Twenty-four bombers of Army Co-operation Command attacked fourelectrical transformer sub-stations between Le Mans and Chartres, and three ofthese, at La Loupe, Courville and Conde Sur Huisne, were effectively hit and damaged.
Aircraft of Fighter and Army Co-operation Commands, of which four are missing, flew 181 sorties in operations against enemy aircraft and transporttargets in north-west Germany, the Low Countries and northern France. Inaddition to two Ju. 87s, two locomotives and a barge destroyed, 54 trains,47 locomotives, seven barges, two destroyers and two merchantmen were damaged.Coastal Operations.30. Hampdens, carrying torpedoes, made three attacks on enemy convoysoff the Frisian Islands; a 6,000-ton merchantman was hit and another of about ,000 tons was probably hit. Results from other attacks could not be seen owingto the aircraft taking evasive action.Another convoy, also off the Frisian Islands, was attacked by escortedtorpedo-carrying and bomb-carrying Beaufighters;&apos; an 8,000-ton ship was torpedoed twice and left listing and on fire, two other ships of 4,000 and 1,500 tons were hit and two &quot; M &quot; class minesweepers were set on fire. Several escort vessels were damaged by cannon and machine-gun fire from the escorting aircraft.Fighters and Whirlwind bombers on anti-shipping operations destroyed two -boats and a trawler, and damaged three armed trawlers, two E-boats, anR-boat and five other ships.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 83 were despatched, laid 204 sea-mines in enemy waters.Northern Italy.31. Bomber Command despatched 178 heavy bombers to attack Spezia, andthe 157 aircraft which attacked dropped 416 tons of bombs. Weather wasexcellent, but a smoke screen was operating over the harbour and dock area, wherethe main weight of the attack, which was well concentrated, fell. One largeorange-coloured explosion, suggesting an ammunition dump, was seen by severalcrews.   One Lancaster was lost on this operation.Mediterranean.Tunisia.32. The Allied Air Forces maintained a heavy scale of activity, in the forward area, and greatly intensified the bombing of airfields. A number of attacks were made on the ports, and in offensive sweeps off the coast manytransport aircraft were shot down.Medium and fighter-bombers made attacks on enemy positions, M.T. andon a number of tanks. Twenty-four U.S. Bostons (A. 20) made two successful attacks, dropping fragmentation bombs, in the area of Ksar Tyr. U.S.Mitchells (B. 25) bombed Mateur, bursts being seen in the town and on therailway. U.S. Bostons (A. 20) made a heavy attack on troops and M.T. inthe Medjez and Djebel areas. Heavy-scale attacks were made by fighter-bombersespecially in the areas of Pont du Fahs, Djedeida, Enfidaville, Medjez el Baband Sidi Ahmed. Fighters made offensive sweeps over the forward area and anumber of enemy aircraft were shot down. During one of these offensive patrolssix enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of four Spitfires, and duringanother, 10 were shot down for the loss of two Spitfires.The airfields and landing grounds at Korba and St. Marie du Zit were attacked by a total of 313 Wellingtons and U.S. medium bombers; during oneattack 124&apos; tons of bombs were dropped. Halifaxes and Wellingtons made twonight attacks on the airfields at Soliman (20 miles E.S.E. of Tunis) andCreteville (13 miles S.E. of Tunis), about 90 tons of bombs being dropped;medium bombers and Spitfires made further attacks in daylight on Creteville.The airfields at La Sebala and La Marsa were bombed by a total of 220 heavy and medium bombers, including 35 French Leo 45; during one attack on LaMarsa, 11 enemy fighters were damaged on the ground. U.S. war hawks(P. 40F), carrying bombs, attacked the airfields at El Bathan and Mabtouha,the latter also being bombed by Fortresses (B. 17). The airfields at Oudna andSidi Ahmed were attacked by heavy and medium bombers. Fighters providedmany escorts and diversionary sweeps to cover these operations.The docks and railway centre at Tunis were -attacked twice, at night by19 Wellingtons and, during daylight, by 21 Fortresses (B. 17); about 80 tons of
bombs were dropped, including three of 4,000 lbs. Bizerta was attacked by13 Wellingtons, and 20 Fortresses (B. 17) attacked Ferryville, where bursts were seen on the pier, barracks and workshops.During numerous offensive sweeps off the coast and in the Gulf of TunisAllied fighters encountered several formations, heavily escorted by fighters, oftransport aircraft. On the 18th. four squadrons of U.S. war hawks (P. 40 F),with a top cover of Spitfires, intercepted at least 100 Ju. 52s escorted by fighters.The enemy aircraft were flying N.E. and apparently carrying troops; 51 Ju. 52sand 15 enemy fighters are reported to have been destroyed by-the U.S. fighters and three enemy fighters by the Spitfires. Nine war hawks and one Spitfire were lost. During other similar patrols Allied fighters destroyed a further 54 enemy aircraft, including a number of Ju. 52s. Ju. 88s and a Ju. 87 towing a glider;12 fighters are missing from these operations.Many sorties were flown on anti-U-boat patrols and escorts were provided forconvoys; Naval Walruses. Swordfish and Albacores co-operated in these operations.   Numerous defensive patrols were also maintained.Enemy activity, though on a slightly decreased scale, remained high. Themain offensive effort was directed against the First Army in the Medjez El Bab-Beja area, where attacks were carried out against tanks. M.T. and artillerypositions.   Enemy effort against the Eighth Army was on a low scale.Thirty enemy aircraft attacked the landing grounds at Souk El Khemis,where three Spitfires were destroyed and five damaged on the ground. SevenJu. 88s bombed the landing ground at El Djem. where two Bostons (A. 20) were destroyed. The harbours at Bone.

A further 49 Fortresses (B. 17) attacked the airfield. A number of enemy aircraft was encountered and 23, including11 Me. 210s. were destroyed in combat.During five attacks on docks and shipping at Catania, U.S. heavy bombersdropped 137 tons of bombs; hits were made on a tanker and a ship at the WesternQuay.   A number of bombers were damaged by A.A.A total of 47 Spitfires from Malta, carrying bombs, attacked Empedocle,Syracuse, Biscari, Ragusa, Cassibile and the harbour at Lampedusa. Numerousdiversionary sweeps over Sicilian airfields were carried out by Spitfires in supportof operations by U.S. heavy bombers. Malta-based Mosquitoes and Beaufightersflew intruder patrols at night over Sicily, Sardinia and the toe of Italy; anumber of hits was made on hangars and several locomotives and trains were damaged.Naples was attacked on two nights by R.A.F. and U.S. heavy bombers; bursts were seen on the quays and in the town area.In Sardinia, Wellingtons made a night attack on the airfields at Elmas,Decimomannu and Villacidro: 45 tons of bombs weie dropped. Twenty-sixFortresses (B. 17), escorted by 26 Lightnings (P. 38), bombed Cagliari Elmas;11 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat. The airfield at Monseratto was attacked by 24 Fortresses (B. 17) and the airfield at Alghero/Fertilia in northernSardinia was attacked by eight U.S. Mitchells (B. 25). Shipping at Porto Torreswas bombed by 18 Mitchells (B. 25) escorted by Lightnings (P. 38); one ship was left sinking and another in flames.S iciliav. ChanneI.34. Naval Albacores attacked with torpedoes an escorted convoy andprobably made a hit on a northbound ship. Another attack was made by similaraircraft when a 5/6,000-ton tanker was hit and left stationary. Wellingtonsattacked a destroyer and a 2,500-ton merchant vessel, the latter being hit andprobably sunk; two Wellingtons were lost in this operation. Four Spitfiresduring a patrol destroyed two Ju. 88s escorting shipping, and later shot downtwo Ju.52s.   Spitfires providing warship cover destroyed four enemy aircraft.
Operational Sorties and Battle Casualties.35.   During the week in the Mediterranean area, 7,775 sorties were flown,and the following casualties are reported :  Destroyed, orMissing. Damaged.Allied    ......      ...... 75 54Destroyed. Probable. Damaged.Enemy ...       ...        212 39 96No account is taken of aircraft destroyed on the ground.Russia.36. There appears to have been considerably more Soviet air activity overthe Russian front this week than last, which may partly be due to improvedweather conditions. From the communiques it seems that this activity has been directed principally against the enemy air forces, rather than their groundtroops, numerous heavy air engagements and damaging raids on enemy airfieldsbeing reported. Two of these raids took place near Leningrad, one on the CentralFront and one on the Southern Front.It is claimed that over 100 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.In air combats on five clays of the week, over the Kuban and Novorossiskareas, the Russians claim to have shot down 64 German aircraft. They also statethat a further 67 were destroyed for a loss of 30 of their own in a heavy enemyraid on Krasnodar.The Russian long-distance bomber force made further raids on Danzig,Koenigsberg and Tilsit.The G.A.F., in the Taman Peninsula, has co-operatecl in some force, and itseems likely that units in the Crimea may have been reinforced for the purposefrom the Donetz front. On the rest of the front weather conditions continue tointerfere with operations.Burma.37. Hurricanes and escorted Blenheims have continued to attack enemy positions and communications on the Mayu Peninsula and enemy-occupiedvillages in the Akyab area; about 310 fighter and bomber sorties were flown onthese operations, from which one Mohawk (P. 36) is missing. In operations against shipping off the Arakan coast, seven launches, six of which were carrying-troops, were sunk.In the Myitkyina area, U.S. Kittyhawks (P. 40) effectively attacked bridges,destroying one at Shaduzup and another at Pinbaw; two others near Mogaungand Namti were severely damaged and the approaches to a fifth near Myitkyinawere also damaged.In the Katha area, five attacks by Allied fighters and light bombers were madeon railway targets, six locomotives and other rolling-stock being damaged. Arefinery at Thihlaywa (30 miles W.N.W. of Katha) was attacked by eight U.S.Liberators (B. 24).In the Upper Chmdwin, Blenheims attacked enemy troops at Thaungdutand a Headquarters, which was hit, at Yuwa.In Central Burma, U.S. Mitchells (B. 25) bombed railway targets atMandalay, where large fires were started in the railway centre, and at Ywathung,where rolling-stock and stores were hit. Further south, at Thazi, about 30 hits were made on the railway yard, and a warehouse was set on fire.At Prome (160 miles N.N.W. of Rangoon), six U.S. Liberators (B. 24)destroyed many buildings and started large fires in the town.Night attacks were made on the airfields at Magwe and Toungoo. and on therailway station at Rangoon.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.38. Effective attacks on enemy shipping have been made by U.S. heavy bombers. In Hansa Bay, a day attack by US. Liberators (B. 24) resulted intwo ships of about 9,000 tons each being hit and left on fire, and the same nightU.S. Fortresses (B. 17) damaged a 2,000-ton cargo ship and a destroyer whichwas just ouside the Bay.   Two days later, a ship of 4,000 tons was set on fire.
A night attack on a convoy oil&apos; Wewak resulted in the sinking of a7,000-ton ship and the probable sinking of two more ships of 7,000 and 8,000 tons respectively; a gun-boat was also hit and subsequently beached, In anotherattack on shipping in the harbour, a 6,000-ton ship was hit and blew up, anda small one was damaged.Other activity consisted, in the main, of small-scale attacks on the airfieldstit Lae, Finschafen, Timika, Nubia and Kaimana.Milne Bay was attacked by 36 enemy heavy bombers and 10 dive-bomberswith an escort of 30 fighters. A small cargo ship was destroyed, two other ships were damaged and two corvettes slightly damaged. Enemy casualties by A.A.and U.S. fighters were 14 aircraft destroyed, nine probably destroyed and sixdamaged for the loss of two TJ.S. fighters.New Britain.A total of 14 Allied bombers made 11 attacks on the airfields at GasmataCape Gloucester and Lakunai, and on the new landing strip at Ubili..1 amboina A rchipelago.An attack on the wharf area at Amboina by four U.S. Liberators (B. 24)resulted in large explosions and fires; four enemy fighters were destroyed in combat.Timor.39.

Twenty-five U.S. aircraft attacked enemy installations and shipping atKahili and Bellale (south of Bougainville) and. at the former, hit a 5,000-tonmerchantman, wdiich was last seen with her decks awash.U.S. torpedo-bombers, attacking shipping near the Shortland Islands, hita 10,000-ton ship, which was left sinking, and also damaged another ship.A leutians.41. Between the 1st and the 20th April U.S. aircraft have made 72 raids on Kiska.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.42. There have been no attacks on land targets by daylight during the period under review.  Attacks were made on four nights.On the night of the 16th/17th minor incidents occurred at various points,mostly in southern and south-eastern England. On the 18th/19th Nonington(Kent) was bombed and a bomb fell on the Millwall football ground.
