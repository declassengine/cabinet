(43) 173.April 21, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY/It is requested that special care may be taken Aoensure the secrecy of this document WAR CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR FORT-NIGHT ENDING  1200 HOURS, SUNDAY. APRIL 11, 1943.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.WEATHER conditions over Germany at night have generally been bad, and despite weather reconnaissance flights have usually turned out worse than expected. As a result, with the exception of the raid on Essen on the3rd/4th April, it is doubtful if any severe concentration of attack has been achieved, but absence of full photographic reconnaissance makes assessment of results impossible as yet. Effort has been considerable : in Germany, Duisburg(twice), Berlin, Essen, Kiel, Frankfurt and Bochum were attacked : in France,.St. Nazaire (twice) and Lorient.Nig&quot;ht Operations.aircraft target.

Full results cannot yet be assessed.Bochum (28th/29th March).This attack was not well concentrated, but probably caused considerablethough scattered damage.Essen (3rd/4th April).Day photographs taken after this attack show that the damage was againconcentrated on Krupps, where three main workshops were hit and twelve other buildings more or less wrecked by fire and ILK. These include the steam hammershop, two machine shops, the open-hearth steelworks and the rolling mill.The Dahlbusch Colliery was severely damaged. Many buildings containingworkers&apos; dwellings, particularly to the south-west of Krupps, also suffered heavily.Print Xo. 1 shows damage to a section of the Krupps works.Kiel (4th/5th April))A very heavy deliberate blind bombing attack was carried out by 577 aircraft,but assessment of damage is not yet possible.Duisburg (8th/9th April).This was a blind bombing attack by 392 aircraft.   Bombing was scattered.Preliminary reports indicate that a second attack on the same night made by109 aircraft (all Lancasters except for the P.F.F. markers) was successful.Frankfurt (10th/11th April).Evidence to date suggests that this was a rather scattered attack. Finalassessment is not yet available.St. Nazaire (28th/29th March).Technically the attack was a complete success. Excellent concentration on asmall target was obtained.Rotterdam (28th and 29th March).Photographs taken during the bombing show that the attacks were extremelyaccurate. A German Sperrbrecher (barrage breaker for clearing minefields) was hit in floating dock. One, possibly two, bursts were obtained on a 250 feet M/V.two on the edge of a floating dock containing a minesweeper. Anotherminesweeper also appears to have been hit, and possible hits were secured on a
number of other minesweepers, barges and ships. Many buildings and dockfacilities were hit, and considerable damage was also done to railway tracks and installations in the neighbourhood.Eindhoven (30th March).An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 5th April showed that as a result of this daylight attack the main building for the manufacture oflamps and the main building for the manufacture of valves in Phillips works were both hit.  The medical section and the transport section were also damaged.Trier (1st April).Print No. 2 shows bursts on the marshalling yards and engine sheds, duringan attack by twelve aircraft.Namur (6th April).The attack was particularly successful considering the small number of aircraft involved. Photographs taken during the bombing show numerous direct hits on the target.   Print No. 3 was taken during the attack.Results of Previous Raids.Berlin. Final interpretation of day photographs confirms that the damage done in the raid on 1st/2nd March was&quot;very heavy, although no extensive areasof devastation were produced.Some 30 factories have been damaged. The principal feature is probably the destruction of the railway repair shops adjoining the Tempelhof marshalling yards, where workshops have been destroyed over an area of 22 acres. two large wireless-set factories, Telefunken and Blaupunktwerke, have been severely damaged, and also two branches of Askania Werke, makers of optical andprecision instruments. Among other works whose premises have suffered severe damage are makers of telephone equipment, roller bearings and fire controlapparatus. Warehouses in the inland docks or military barracks were burnt contributory destroyed by H.E., and at least 4.800 flats or houses and 600 detached or semi-detached houses were destroyed or very severely damaged.It is of interest that the damage to the Air Ministry and Foreign Officereported by ground sources is not seen on the photographs. The damage to theAir Ministry was caused by a bomb which fell in one of the inner courtyards;between 200 and 300 rooms were destroyed or severely damaged and importantrecords were lost.Most of the damage appears to have been caused by the phosphorusincendiary bombs, which, in addition to their destructive effect, caused numerouscasualties through, burns to people who attempted to deal with them, and theheavy bombs which, apart from completely destroying all buildings in the imrae-cliate neighbourhood of impact, would blow out all windows within 500 yards.The extent of the fire damage revealed confirms reports that the Berlin fire services were unable to deal with the situation and help had to be provided fromLeipzig.Essen. A reliable source who was in Essen on the 22ncl March between thesecond and third attacks reports that no work was in progress at Krupps andthat 15,000 Krupps workers and 75,000 other inhabitants were homeless. Gassupplies were still interrupted on the 23rd March.Hamburg. It is reliably reported that in the third bombing attack of the3rd/4th February three of the U-boat building slips at Blobm and Vosscontaining U-boats under construction were hit. Buildings were also set on firein the Hitzler speed-boat building yard.Munich. In the attack on the 9th/ 10th March 1^ acres of the BayerischeMotorwerke (aero-engines) were burnt out. The electric locomotive servicingshed, which photographs show contained at least 18 locomotives, and the steamengine round house near the main station were also burnt out.Cologne. One of the Rhine bridges at Cologne (the Hangebrucke) was badly damaged in the attack of the 26th/27th February and was still open only topedestrians at the end of March.France.. Nantes. A reliable source reports that in the attack on the St. Josephlocomotive works the only part to escape damage was an office building.   The[25338] b 2
heavy machine building and the oil and rag depot were severely damaged.Seventeen locomotives from St. Nazaire awaiting repair were further damaged.The population were impressed by the accuracy of the bombing, as not a house in the neighbourhood was hit.   Print No. 4 shows some of the damage.Ougree. In the attack on the 12th March on the Co.cker.il] Works, theCentrale Electrique and other buildings were hit. As a result, all work stoppedand no date for its resumption has yet been fixed.Holland.Maasluis. Photographs taken after the daylight attack on the 18th Marchshow that a building of the Maasluis Oil Refinery was damaged. In additiona considerable area of a multi-bay building belonging to the VereanidgeTouwfriek N.W. (rope factory) has been destroyed.The Anti-U-Boat Campaign.During the past 12 months Bomber Command have heavily attacked thesubmarine building yards at Hamburg, Bremen, Kiel, Danzig and Vegesack,where 80 per cent, of U-boat construction is carried out. The most impressiveresults so far achieved by the 8,590 sorties despatched against these and the less important building yards have been (i) 3-4 months&apos; delay in the construction of U-boats at the KriegsmarineWerft at Kiel.(ii) The  almost  total   destruction  of  the  Nordseewerk  at   Emden,   inJune 1942.(iii) Delays of from  10-12 months  in  the construction  of  U-boats willhelmshaven.(iv) Delays at Bremerhaven (where U-boats have taken twice the normaltime fitting out) and Hamburg.The fact that German U-boat production has not increased perceptibly since june 1942, though the maximum capacity of the building yards lias not been attained, may well be due to bottlenecks in the production of components resultingfrom attacks on industrial centres. Photographs show that over one-third of the factories in Germany, Italy and German-occupied territory which are known toproduce U-boat components and accessories, have received some bomb damage inthe past year. Among them are almost two-thirds of the plants engaged on theproduction of U-boat diesel engines. The number of small firms engaged onU-boat sub-contracts which have been damaged or written off cannot be assessed.The 3,400 mines laid by Bomber Command in the last year have beenprimarily directed against U-boats. In vieAv of the extreme difficulty of obtainingevidence of the successes achieved by this method, it is highly significant thatthere have been reports of four submarines sunk and. three damaged by mines.Over 3,000 sorties have been despatched against Lorient and St. Nazaireand both towns are destroyed.Morale in Germany.There is evidence that morale in the Ruhr and Rhineland is becoming badlystrained. It would be remarkable if this were not so. In the first three monthsof 1943, Bomber Command aircraft have attacked the area on 43 nights out ofa possible 90. Many of these were small visits, designed primarily to developtechnique and cause general annoyance, but all of them met with flak opposition.Thus everyone in the Ruhr has been disturbed by sirens and gunfire roughly every other night for three months, excluding occasions on which aircraft proceeding to other destinations in Germany have set off the Ruhr alarms.There are convincing reports from ground sources confirmed by signs whichcannot be altogether suppressed in the press that discouragement and defeatismare rising rather sharply at present.   The only overt evidence of this is (a) increased criticism of the Party and of Hitler himself;(&amp;) decreased readiness to take part in A.R.P. work.The existence of both these trends is to some extent confirmed by the propaganda line of the Nazi Press. Appeals for unremitting A.R.P. action areceaseless, and large batches of decorations are handed out in bombed cities to
encourage them : the efficiency of the Party in providing relief is heavilyunderlined; the tendency of morale to strengthen under air attack, and the&quot; cultural monuments &quot; appeal to stimulate hatred against the attackers are bothconstantly written up.The possibility of a sudden collapse of morale in the Ruhr and Rhineland is nevertheless very small. As long as the Party can keep up relief measures (whichin the prevailing shortage of consumer goods is not an easy matter) there shouldbe no outbreaks which the Gestapo cannot easily control.German Propaganda.The following was issued for home consumption by the Berlin VblkischerBeobachter on the 13th March : &quot; Berlin, 12th March, 1943. Heavy German bombers dealt heavy blowson the night of the 12th March, 1943, against Newcastle, the most importantcoal-exporting town and naval ship-building centre on the East coast ofEngland. Shortly before 2200 hours the first bombs fell on Newcastle, andtargets in the port and important industrial concerns in the town were bombed for about 20 minutes. Amongst the bombs dropped by the first waveof bombers were large numbers of incendiaries and some very heavy H.E.bombs.&quot; Huge fires were already blazing in the industrial area, when newformations of German aircraft appeared about half an hour after the firstattack. Direct hits, one after the other, continued the work of destruction.British night fighters and A.A. guns were powerless against these terrificnight attacks.&quot;On the night in question, 12 German aircraft attacked Tyneside. damage and casualties were slight.   One aircraft was shot down.a; H. M. S.A ir Ministry,April 21, 1943.
