The Italian naval base of Spezia was attacked twice with great effect. Of the targets attacked the SkodaWorks at Pilsen alone escaped damage.Night Operations.Target.SpeziaStuttgartPilsen Skoda WorksMannheim   ...SpeziaStettinRostock    &apos; ...BerlinDay Operations.Hengelo Diesel engine worksBelgium railway targetsCaen and Abbeville marshallingyardsHamburg,havenCherbourg-Bremen and Wilhelms-ship-whale oil factoryOstend chemical works   ...Haarlem railway workshopsAbbeville engine sheds   ...Caen engine shedsZeebrugge coke ovensDieppe M/V. in Avant PortMiscellaneous targets : railways in belgium;   motor    barges   onR.

Day photographiccover confirmed that very severe damage was caused, the largest single incidentbeing the virtual destruction of the naval storehouses at one of the docks, whereabout five acres were gutted. The foundry, the infantry and artillery barracks and many unidentified buildings also suffered badly.In the second attack, the torpedo workshops and shipbuilding shop were severely damaged by H.E. The torpedo factory is behesed to be the secondlargest in Italy, storage being estimated, at over 600 torpedoes. Day photographiccover reveals further extensive damage to store houses. The electricity work-shops were still burning when our photographic reconnaissance was canned out.The fitter&apos;s shop and boiler shop have both been damaged, and many buildings inthe artillery and naval barracks destroyed. Damage to transportation includesbuildings in the rail goods depot as well as tracks and rolling stock destroyed. Asfar as is known, the Italian battleships in the port were not hit, but a 1.600-tondestroyer of the most modern type was sunk in the course of the attack.Damage in the town is severe as a result of these two attacks, especially inthe neighbourhood of the docks, where at least 30 house blocks and 20 otherhouses were affected.   Print No. 1 shows damage in the dock area.Stuttgart (14th/15th April).Weather conditions were favourable for this attack and. very considerable success was achieved. Photographs show that heavy damage was caused in thenorth and north-eastern districts. In Bad Cannstaclt, the power station, theElektron Metal Works, a sugar factory and other industrial buildings have been damaged, and. an area of 30 acres has been devastated by fire and HE. Railwayrepair shops in Unterturkheim have been destroyed over an area of 9 acres.In the centre of the city several railway sheds and buildings north of the main station have been damaged, some severely, and there are several direct hits onthe railway line.To the north-east, there is considerable damage in the districts of Berg andHofen, while the suburb of Mtilhausen has been practically devastated.Pilsen (16th/17th April).327 heavies were despatched to Pilsen to deliver an attack on the Skodaworks, which the cessation of work at Krupps has made even more vital to Germanarmament production than before. The distance of this target from home basesmade it essential to attack before shortening hours of darkness put it beyondeffective range, and the difficulty of identifying it accurately made it necessaryto accept the cost of attacking on a night clear enough to give considerable advantage to the enemy\s fighter defences. To offset this tactical disadvantageto some extent, 271 aircraft (including 159 Wellingtons) were sent on adiversionary attack to Mannheim at the same time. The attack on Pilsen wasunsuccessful, but the attack on Mannheim produced very good results.
Mannheim (16th/17th April).This attack caused heavy damage to industry and transportation. &apos; the synthetic oil and another research laboratory belonging to I.G. Farben have been damaged ; the power station has been hit and appears to be out of action; and16 other workshops have suffered; many other factories in and around the townhave also been hit, and 8 acres of the dock area have been devastated. Themain railway station has suffered damage to building and tracks, while the traindepot is completely gutted; in view of the known difficulty of providing adequatelocal transport for workers in Rhineland cities, this will certainly cause a serious loss of labour time. Damage has also been done to the barracks where 11 build-irigs have stiff ered anc 1 also to residential property scattered over the town.Stettin (20th/21st April).No successful attack had previously been made against Stettin, Germany&apos;principal Baltic port. On the 20th/21st April it was attacked by a force of339 Lancaster and Halifax aircraft. A simultaneous attack on Rostock wascarried out by 86 Stirlings, whose speed and range was insufficient to enablethem to attack Stettin successfully within the hours of darkness. A diversionwas created by 11 Mosquitoes which visited Berlin. There is evidence that theenemy was deceived, as was intended, into thinking that the entire force wasen route to Berlin.The attack was an outstanding success. First attempts to obtain day photo-graphs were largely unsuccessful because of the clouds of smoke which stillcovered the town. Later photographs show that the southern part of Stettin,in which practically the whole of the town&apos;s industries are concentrated, has suffered very heavily. Detailed assessment is still awaited. Prints Nos. 2-5show some of the damage.Rostock (20th/21st April).An effective smoke screen prevented the Rostock force from succesfullyattacking the Heinkel works, which were its primary objective, but it succeeded in causing a large amount of important damage in the town and dock area. fires were still burning when photographs were taken on the day after the attack. Themost important item of damage is 6-^ acres of workshops in the Neptun shipyardsdestroyed by fire (Print No. 6); considerable damage was also done to docks,industry and transportation. This attack, complementary to the much heavierraid on Stettin, contributed substantially to the general dislocation of theGerman supply route through the Baltic to the eastern front.Results of Previous Raid.Essen.Final assessment of the damage caused by the third attack on the3rd/4th April reveals more damage to Krupps. In the northern section of theworks the steam-hammer shop has received a direct hit; in the. central section the new machine shop has received at least two direct hits which have destroyedan area of 2,030 square yardsthe machine shop (which was damaged previously) has suffered severe damage over an area of 2,700 square yards with roof damage over afurther 25,760 square yards, the open-hearth steelworks (3 workshops) have been partly destroyed, and the billet-rolling shop, small repair shop and office buildings have been completely destroyed by HE. and fire over a total area of 16,560 square yards; in the southern section the workshop south of Miinchener Strasse has been damaged by fire over an area of 6,000 square yards.Damage to communications includes the destruction or part-destruction ofthe suburban stations of Bergeborbeck (Vogelheim) and Essen West, and damage to the goods station at Essen West. The engine rouncl-house south-east of Essenmain station has also been damaged.Among public buildings in Essen, the Rathaus (Alten Essen) has been completely gutted, and the County Court has been severely damaged.Print No. 7 shows the total damage inflicted on Essen in the three attacks ofthe 5th/6th March, 13th/14th March and 3rd/4th April.Dusseldorf.It is reported that the damage caused to the Schiess Defries machine-toolworks at Dusseldorf last year caused several months&apos; delay in the completion of[25414] b 2
a new programme for heavy flak. One of the principal causes was the completedestruction of the drawing office, which considerably hampered the productionof the necessary new machine-tools.Munich.It has been learnt from a high official of the Munich railway administrationthat during the attack on the 9th/ 10th March 50 steam and electric locomotiveswere totally destroyed in engine sheds near the main station. Damage to the electric system and to the power cables was severe, and all movement of electriclocomotives was stopped.Another reliable source reports that traffic on the Munich-Innsbruck line didnot function normally until 16 days after the attack.Cologne.Ground sources have reported that, in the attack on the 2nd/3rd February,damage was caused to the I.G. Farben Chemical Works at Leverkusen. Photo-graphic cover obtained on the 14th April disclosed damage to the Naphthaleneplant, the Alizarine Laboratory and the Head Office.Stuttgart.Evidence is proving that the attack on the llth/T2th March was far more successful than the photographic reconnaissance disclosed. It is now known thatworkmen were ordered to leave their factories to assist in clearance and repair and that craftsmen, the police and members of the armed forces were brought in from other parts of Germany for the same purpose. A reliable source reportsthat, apart from damage to the tramway depot itself, power centres were affected and the tramways did not again become fully serviceable until the 20th March.The Ruhr.In addition to the results achieved by concentrated attacks, recent photo-graphs show that much useful damage has been caused by other raids whoseresults could not be assessed at the time. For example, in Bottrop, many residen-tial and commercial buildings have been destroyed, and a built-up area of 11^ acreshas been more than 50 per cent, destroyed. In Oberhausen there is 11 acres of severe damage to residential, commercial and public property, which includes theOber Lyceum and the Kataster Amt (Land Registry Office).There is fresh but scattered damage in Duisburg. Bochum and Mulheim,Werthausen and Linden ,/Dalhausen.Paderborn.Photographs show that in the daylight attack on the 16th March the engine-shed was severely damaged and about one-third of it destroyed. The main shopof the railway workshops has received two direct hits, and damage has been caused to the main entrance block and two platforms of the railway station.Several smaller workshops have been destroyed or damaged.German Morale the Ruhr.The following extract from the National-Zeitung, Essen, is of interest :&quot; What the population in districts threatened by air raids can endure has itslimits, and the limit has been reached. The Ruhr district has felt the burdenof the war more than any other German province, and it is therefore only fairthat provinces living in better circumstances should help carry the burden. this must be done by mobilising craftsmen in order to repair the houses of the Ruhrpopulation. It may also be necessary to place cars, buses and tramcars at thedisposal of the Ruhr towns. The most capable officials must be sent to the Ruhrdistricts, and the distinct must be given far-reaching self-administration. Theeconomic administration must be adapted to conditions similar to those at thefront. The paper war must cease, and all trifling matters must be disregarded ina situation like this.&quot;The U-Boat War and the Bomber Offensive.Numerous articles which have recently appeared in the German press explain(a) that U-Boats contain a large number of aircraft which would otherwise bebombing Germany; (b) that the effects of the U-Boat war on Britain are really
more destructive than those of the Bomber offensive against Germany, though they are not so obvious. These articles may partly be intended to counter ademand for greater steps to be taken to keep Bomber Command out of Germany.Erratum to W.P.
