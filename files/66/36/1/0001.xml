(43) 151.April 14, 1943.WAR CABINET.PROXY MARRIAGES.Memorandum by the Home Secretary. -REPRESENTATIONS have been made to me and have from time to time been voiced in Parliament that the law should be so amended as to enable men serving with the forces abroad to marry women in this country by &quot; proxy.&quot;2.   I have been in consultation with the Service Departments : (a) The Admiralty says that there is no noticeable demand for proxymarriage, and on the whole the Board &apos;-&apos; do not consider that its introduction would be justified merely to meet the few cases of genuine hardship which undoubtedly exist, while at the same time itmight be the cause of much mischief by being open to many abuses,and in many cases would be another factor tending to the earlybreak-up of so many war-time marriages.&quot;&quot; (b) The War Office have received some representations regarding soldiersserving abroad who wish to contract marriages, but. while from theWar Office point of view they see no substantial objection to theproposal, in view of the attitude of the other two Services, they do not wish to press the question of seeking legislation.(c) The Air Ministry have received no such demands as would lead them tothink a change in the law desirable.3. In the absence of any desire on the part of the Service Departments, Ido not myself think it would be justifiable to propose at the present time a changein the law on this subject; but, as the view is held strongly by many people thatthe existing law imposes unnecessary hardship, especially when a woman ispregnant, I think it right to bring the question before my colleagues.4.   The case for proxy marriages can be summarised as follows  (a) Many a man who is sent abroad on war service is anxious to marry a woman in this country, and it is an unnecessary hardship to deprivesuch a man of facilities for a marriage which would ease his mind and mitigate his anxieties.(&amp;) Unnecessary hardship is said, to be caused to the woman, especially if sheis pregnant. Under the Legitimacy Act of 1926 subsequent marriagelegitimises the child, but the father of the child may be killed beforemarriage can take place.(c) The woman&apos;s financial position is liable to be affected by the loss of opportunity to marry. If a woman has been living with a soldier anddependent on him before he joined the Army she can draw if he iskilled some allowance after his death in respect of her child. Butthere is no similar provision for a girl- who becomes the mother of a soldier&apos;s child but has not been living with him and dependent on him before he joined the forces. So long as the soldier is alive she can obtain an allowance for the maintenance of the child, but she can obtain nothing from Army funds after the death of the soldier.[25303]
(d) In many foreign countries, including Holland * Spain, Portugal and egypt, the law authorises proxy marriages, and such marriages arenot, I am informed, contrary to the Canon law of the Church of Rome.5. On the other hand, account has to be taken of the following considerations :  (a) It has hitherto been an essential feature of our marriage law that theparties shall exchange their vows in the presence of each other. Theabandonment of that requirement is liable to lessen the gravity andsolemnity of marriage vows. There is a great psychological differencebetween the present procedure by which the parties pledge themselvesin the presence of each other and witnesses, and a procedure by whichthe man would, sign a. declaration before witnesses in, say, India orNorth. Africa, and the woman would sign a declaration before aregistrar in this country or- would go through some ceremony in achurch with an individual who is acting as &quot; proxy &quot; for the bride-groom.(b) Under the present law the parties, even if they have engaged themselves and given notice of the marriage, are entitled to change their mindsup to the moment of the actual ceremony when vows are exchangedface to face. Under the proposed system of separate declarations byparties who are widely separated geographically there will be alengthy interval between the dates of the two declarations; and inany legislation provisions would be required settling- (i) what is to be the position of a party who, during this interval,wishes to revoke a declaration already made; and(ii) what is to be the position of the party making the later declarationif it is then discovered that the party making the earlierdeclaration has died in the interval. What, for example, isto be the position of a woman if. after the completion of all theformalities, it is discovered that the man was killed in the interval between the date at which he made his declaration and the date at which the formalities were completed by thewomaiVs declaration &apos;?(c) These large changes in the law are advocated in order to enable persons to marry who are unable to meet and will be unable for a long time to live together. In some such cases the determination to cleave togethermay be strong and lasting, but the scheme would also extend the field of opportunity for the contracting of wartime marriages of the type which are liable to break up.(d) Although the change is advocated as a temporary wartime change, yetif it were granted that such a fundamental alteration of our marriagelaw is admissible under war conditions it would be arguable that thechange should be made permanent, and in the absence of a far strongercase for a wartime change than appears to exist it would seemundesirable to embark in a wartime atmosphere on a modification ofthe marriage law which might have far-reaching effects in the future.6. The question has been considered whether, if the change were proposed for wartime purposes only, it could properly be effected by means of a defence regulation. Whether it could be argued that arrangements for facilitatingproxy marriages are &quot; necessary or expedient for the efficient prosecution of thewar &quot; is a question which would have to be considered, but, in any case, there arestrong arguments for holding that the subject-matter is of such a character thatit ought to be fully discussed by Parliament before the law is changed. It isdifficult to forecast how strong might be the opposition to such a change, and theuse of wartime powers for this purpose would expose the Government to a chargeof proceeding in an unjustifiably high-handed manner. On the whole, therefore,I think that, if the change were contemplated, legislation would be desirable.Any Bill on the subject would necessarily have to contain a number of detailed provisions for securing that the parties are properly identified, and for preventingimpersonation and other abuses.* In Holland, I understand tl?.n.t Royal Licences authorising proxy marriages were issued tomeet cases where a man had gone to the Dutch Colonies, and after he had attained a position inwhich he could marry it was desired that Iris fiancee should go out from Holland to join him.
7. Subject to the consideration of the views of my colleagues, I think thebalance of consideration is against proposing any such change in the law, and thatan announcement to this effect should be made to Parliament. The question was last raised in the debate on the Army Estimates on the 17th March, when theFinancial Secretary to the War Office stated that, while he could not hold out any hope of legislation being introduced, &quot;no doubt those who are responsible fordealing with th- question of marriage &quot; would give consideration to the views expressed by Members who had advocated proxy marriages.I have consulted the Secretary of State for Scotland, who supports, so far asScotland is concerned, the conclusion that no action should be taken. The questionis one upon which the Scottish churches, if consulted, would undoubtedly havestrong views; and the Secretary of State for Scotland is definitely of opinion thatit is unnecessary and undesirable in present circumstances to stir up controversyabout it.H. M.Home Office, April 14, 1943.
