Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET.THE APPLICATION OE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OFGOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister.I am submitting to my colleagues certain considerations which seem to me tobe relevant to the problems which have to be faced in the post-war world.C. R. A.II Downing Street,May 11, 1943.THE average citizen of this country, when he says that he stands fordemocratic government, consciously or unconsciously equates it with the particularmethod of parliamentary democracy and responsible government which theBritish people have, in the course of a long evolution, worked out in practice assuiting our particular conditions.Well-instructed people will admit that there are other methods of democratic government, such as that obtaining in the United States of America, Some people will even suggest that the Soviet system is a form of democracy. Most peoplerecognise that the many variants of parliamentary democracy that were in forcein most European countries and which still exist in Sweden and Switzerlandwere democratic, but, though not explicitly, they regard them as either fallingshort of or in process of evolution towards the British model. This is also true of their approach to Colonial and Indian problems. The different parts of theBritish Empire are regarded as entitled to the system which we have here, whichI call for short the &quot; Westminster Model.&quot; The Dominions have already reachedthe goal. Some Colonies are approaching it, others have a long way to travel, butfew doubt that this is the goal. Highbrow theorists and sentimental humanitarian-tarians find here a common ground. Thus there were many who thought that theprime cause of the loss of Malaya was our failure to have erected a Westminsterat Singapore, while the desirability of giving India a Constitution as close aspossible to our own is held most strongly by those whose knowledge of the subject is least.Nor is this faith bounded by creed or caste or colour. It extends beyond the ranks of our fellow-countrymen. The Indian politician and the educated Africanis equally certain of the efficacy of the Westminster recipe. To them all otherprescriptions should be rejected as spurious imitations of the genuine article.Any alteration is a derogation from freedom and a subtle attempt to keep themtied in the leading strings of imperialism. Yet the British or Westminstersystem has so far been successfully operated only in Great Britain and the fourDominions. On the Continent of Europe only the Scandinavian States and,perhaps, the Low Countries work successfully an approximation to the West-minster Model, although for the greater part of the nineteenth century it was accepted by almost all liberals as the last word in democratic development.[25431] bSECRET.W.P. (43) 199.May 11, 1943.
It is, of course, easy to suggest that the failure of parliamentary governmentin some of the Continental States was due to the political inexperience of thepeople. There is some truth in this, for most of the Continental States had buta very short history of constitutionalism as compared with our own long history.We are apt to forget that behind our present comparative political calm lie thestorms of the Stuart period and the violent political factiousness of the Whigs andTories of the early 18th Century. Tolerance, which is essential to the workingof the Westminster Model, is a plant of very slow growth.But there is one particular condition which u necessary for the successfulworking of any form- of democracy, but more particularly that of the WestminsterModel, that is the willingness of the minority to accept the will of the majority in the hope that they too will in due course become the majority. It is this which enables our system to work, but wherever there is a conscious minority whichbelieves that under no circumstances can it become the majority, it proves inpractice to be unworkable.In Great Britain Liberals and Tories could always hope that a turn of the electoral wheel would bring them into power. I can remember the beginningsof the Labour Party with two members in the House, but faith in the democraticmethod was strong enough for its adherents to wait and work for a quarter of a century before a Labour Government was formed. The possibility of the conversion of the majority was always present. But if the Labour Party hadbeen based not on political and economic principles, but on some racial religious or cultural difference, such patience would not have been found. The historyof the Irish Party illustrates this. Time had sufficiently broken down the differences between English, Scots and Welsh to allow of nationalism to besubdued to a wider loyalty and to be crossed by other lines of division, but thisis a very rare occurrence. It can be parallelled in Belgium, where the&apos; strifebetween Flemings and Walloons has not been too intense, but in Scandinavia the differences between Swedes and Norwegians proved too great and the minoritygroup seceded. It was for many years the custom in Labour circles, following a general theory of the all-importance of the economic factor, to hold that racialand religious differences and even the colour bar were fostered and maintained by the privileged for the express purpose of dividing the workers and that as soonas the people were sufficiently enlightened, the &quot; natural &quot; class division would cut through all these barriers and the workers of the world would unite. Thehistory of the last few decades lends little support to this optimistic theory. Race,language, colour, religion and history are stubborn things that do not disappear &apos;at the waving of a Marxian wand. Those of us who desire a democratic worldmust recognise that one of the most difficult problems which has to be faced is thatof the application of democratic principles to countries which are inhabited by two or more communities who are unable or unwilling to trust each other. Every-one is conscious of those difficulties in considering post-war Europe. There are some countries which are inhabited by homogeneous or almost homogeneouspeoples such as France. There are or have been others where the problem has beensolved by secession. Instances are those of Norway-Sweden, noted above, andBelgium-Holland, in the early 19th Century, but thd European problem is most difficult in countries such as those of Central and South-Eastern Europe, wherethe populations are hopelessly intermingled. The despairing solution of whole-sale forced migration is seriously considered.My immediate concern is with the British Commonwealth and Empire.There, to a far greater extent than is commonly understood, we are confronted with this problem. Of the Dominions, Australia and New Zealand are happilyfree from this problem, unless in the case of the latter a heavy fall in birth rateof the Whites and a very steep rise in that of the Maoris in&quot;the distant futureraises the question, for, broadly speaking, the problem does not arise acutelywhere minorities are very small. It is the struggle for power which exacerbatesintercommunal relations.In Canada the two races, British and French, have hitherto got on togetherwithout too much friction, but there is the possibility of trouble. The French-Canadian birth rate is so much greater than that of the other race that a time may come when the numerical preponderance of the less educated and lessadvanced community may give it power over the wealthier and more modernsection. Then there may well be a serious crisis. In South Africa there has beena long history of rivalry between the British and the Dutch. Who can say what will happen when Smuts goes? Behind this quarrel looms the much greatermenace of the struggle between a white ruling minority and a black majority.This menace hangs also over Southern Rhodesia and Kenya Colony. Little New-foundland is fairly homogeneous, but the triple division by religious faith may
not always be soluble by the device of Trinitarian ministries. Ireland, North and.South, provide together one of the most intractable problems in the Empire.In the West Indies we have a problem somewhat akin -to that of South Africa,though not exactly parallel. Here are white oligarchies possessed of a degreeof self-government with black majorities in process of enfranchisement. Theyare geographically placed in an uneasy equilibrium between the United States,where in the South the negro is theoretically a free, and equal citizen, but inpractice is debarred from ail hope of effective political power, to say nothing of social equality, and. our West African Colonies, where the negroes are encouraged to hope that they are on, though not far along, the road to self-government. how long it will be possible to deny full political rights to the West Indian negroes and how the two communities will then manage the affairs of these islands, admit ofwide conclusions.It may be that in our African possessions we have not yet gone too far in holding up for emulation the Westminster Model. I do not know how far ineach particular colony there is sufficient homogeneity to preclude a struggle forpower between communities. This struggle does not as a rule emerge until atrustee begins to relinquish control. When this happens old memories of pastdomination begin to stir again.    I could imagine this happening in Nigeria.I now come to the group of countries where the matter is most acute. First,there is Palestine. The rivalry of Jew and Arab needs no description. I donot believe that the Jews would be willing to accept the Westminster Modelwith a permanent Arab majority. Undoubtedly an Arab majority would at oncestop Jewish immigration and the dream of the Jewish National Home would be,ended. I do not believe that under a parliamentary system political parties would line up on economic lines with a Jewish-Arab united proletariat. Allexperience suggests the contrary. The Arab majority would also fear the superiorefficiency of the Jew and would be unlikely to accept him as an equal Palestinian.A parliamentary system in Palestine would be a prelude to civil war.When I was on the Indian Statutory Commission I came to the conclusionthat the Westminster Model was unsuited to this ^reat sub-continent with itscontending communities. All that has occurred since has confirmed me in my views. The difficulty is that no community wall trust the other to play the gamewithout a referee. We are, unfortunately, the referee and have to take theconsequences of such a situation. Pakistan is an attempt to apply the Norway-Sweden remedy, but communities are so intermingled that it is no solution. the minorities, whether Hindu in Moslem India or Moslem in Hindu India, will nottrust the majorities, but demand safeguards. The same is true of the scheduledcastes and the smaller minorities such as the Sikhs.In Ceylon there is the same difficulty: the Tamils and the Burghers willnot trust the Sinhalese majority. In Burma the Karens and the Indians donot trust the Burmese. Owing to the comparative smallness of the minoritiesthere is not quite the same difficulty here; also the Burmese are fairly easy-going,but full self-government will be a risky experiment.In Malay there is the contest between the abler and more industrious Chinese and the Malays, the former being in a slight majority.I have cited all these instances, not because I have any doubts as to theprinciples of democracy, but because I do not think that adequate thought hasbeen given to the practical problem of how democracy is to work satisfactorilywhere, within the confines of one country which cannot easily be divided, thereare two or more communities which obstinately remain distinct. It is no useblaming them, still less is it useful to ignore the difficulty.   It is real and urgent.There is one European country which has successfully overcome these difficulties Switzerland. Here Ave have three linguistic groups, each one withaffiliations to neighbouring nations, divided into rival religious sects, yetmanaging to co-operate to form a distinct nationality and to carry on centuryafter century &amp; democratic form of government.It is, of course, easy to explain it by a single word federation. But federalconstitutions are not easy to work. To be successful they must be the result of a desire of the units to federate. I do not know of any example of the creationof a federal state from a unitary state in order to overcome internal difficulties.Granted that Switzerland is &apos; in an exceptional geographic and economic position,&quot; there must be something in its constitution more than the mere federalidea. The essential question in all federations is. &quot;Where does the ultimatepower lie? &quot; If, in the long run, it lies with the majority community, theproblem is not solved.   The Moslems in India, although given very full powers[25431] t; 2
iii the provincial sphere in the provinces in which they have a majority, are yetafraid that under federation the Central Government will be in the hands of the hindus. The history of most federations is that under modern conditions of necessity the centre seeks and obtains more and more power at the expense ofthe provinces. The Australian Commonwealth and the United States areinstances. Hence the Moslem fear. Is it possible to devise a constitutionalscheme which will give either to federal units- or to communities very full controlover cultural and domestic affairs while giving to the Centre necessary powersshared by the communities &apos;.If it be accepted that the &quot;Westminster Model is not applicable to theimmensely varied conditions of the &quot;Colonial and Indian Empires, it does not follow that there is some one alternative, some sealed pattern to be issued at theappropriate time to the aspirants for self-government. On the contrary, I believethat the varying circumstances require various solutions of the problem of democratic government.The first essential is to disabuse the minds of the peoples of the Common-wealth and Empire of their obsession that there is a ladder of which the toprung is Westminster, and that all other systems connote an inferiority of status.It is probably also important to disabuse the American mind of the idea thatstates with constitutions on the American Model with President, Senate, &amp;c, are necessarily democratic in practice. A study of the history of Central and SouthAmerica should help this process.The second essential is to consider carefully the varieties of problemspresented and to seek for possible solutions for each particular case.In my view it would be well for us to consider first of all whether we reallywish to maintain as a necessary feature of national status the completelyindependent state possessing all the powers and performing all the functionsenjoyed by European States in the tempered anarchy of the 19th Century. to judge by his paper on Colonial Policy, Mr. Cordell Hull still lives in that epoch.Again and again he stresses the conception of complete &quot; independence.&quot; He seesall the Colonies waiting for their 1778. Of course this is ridiculous. No one with any knowledge supposes that the inhabitants of St. Helena, the Solomons,Trinidad or the Gambia are longing for independence and are hoping that their countries will become independent sovereign states.But this conception is. I believe, also contrary to the tendency amongthoughtful Continental statesmen who are now realising that independentsovereignty may be too clearly bought at the price of insecurity. Norway andother small States have now had the bitter experience of finding that studiedneutrality and harmlessness does not bring safety. The lambs are beginning torealise the value of a sheepfold and also of a sheepdog with good teeth to protect them. The Oslo grouping which we heard of before the war was only the pathetichuddling of the sheep on seeing a wolf entering the field.Smaller units all over the world desire collective security by association with others. A really effective international police force with an international tribunalwill remove from the ambit of self-government some of the greatest difficultieswhich face communities. Foreign policy and defence problems will be dealt withby an authority which is supernational. There will of course remain to the StateGovernment the enforcement of law and order.We may also hope that some of the larger questions of commercial, financialand economic policy will be subjects of international regulation. To take an example, we may hope that the major economic problem of colonial territories which depend on single or very few products such as the sugar islands may besettled by international regulation.We may hope that some problems of transportation, especially by air, which concern particularly our island possessions will be settled internationally.If the conception of complete majority rule is rejected, it follows that theI need for a Government to be, after the British model, the creature of one party. may also have to go.   It is not always remembered that it was not until the reigiiI of George the First, and then mainly owing to the Tories being tinged withI Jacobitism, that the convention of a Ministry all drawn from one party or at leastfrom coalesced parties arose.   In Switzerland the Executive is not framed on thismodel.   In such a State as Czechoslovakia, where democracy functioned fairlywell, Governments drawn from several parties were the rule, and regard was hadto the need for including representatives of the Slovak minorities.  In the Punjab,where a single Ministry has functioned with success ever since the reforms, thereis a careful balance of Hindu, Sikh and Moslem, and, although the Governmenthas an avowedly agrarian basis, there has been included a representative of the
urban Hindu intelligentsia in the person of Mr. Manohar Lai. In Canada careis taken to represent the different provinces in the Ministry, while in Newfound-land, before Commission Government, the three religious communities were always given equal representation.Further, the conception of the Executive necessarily being dependent on theday-to-day votes of the Legislature is a characteristic British device not found inmany other democracies.As has been pointed out, the difficulty in a country inhabited by more thanone community is to find some way of avoiding giving ultimate power to themajority community, which is e.% hypothesi distrusted by the minority. In theBritish Empire we frequently provide the point of balance through the instru-mentality of the Governor or of officials. It often works well, but there areobjections : (a) There appears to be a derogation from full self-government.(b) It looks like imperialism.(c) Our representatives are responsible to the British Parliament, which istherefore ultimately the deciding factor.(d) There is the suspicion that we act primarily in our own interests or havea bias to one community, e.g., the Moslems, because of our interestselsewhere.Is it possible to bring in a balancing element by a different channel than thatof a Governor or an official ?   Here is a suggestion which might be explored.In the 14th and 15th centuries the faction-ridden Italian republics used tobring in for a limited period a Podesta from&apos; outside the State who was outsidethe local factions. Frequently the method worked well. Would it be possible to induce peoples whose excessive communalism stands in the way of self-govern-ment to accept something of the same sort? Take, for instance, a country with two intermingled communities, a majority and a minority, mutually suspicious,but culturally fitted for self-government. The Constitution might provide fora bicameral Legislature with a Lower Chamber elected by popular vote, possibly in joint, possibly in communal, constituencies on a population basis, and for anUpper House either directly elected or chosen by the communal groups in theLower Chamber, consisting of an equal number from each community. TheMinistry might be elected on the Swiss model by the Legislature, the portfoliosbeing equally divided between the communities. The Ministry would then haveto choose an impartial person from some foreign country who would form partof the Ministry. (He might very well hold the portfolio of Justice.) TheMinistry would be elected for a term of years as in Switzerland,If divisions continued to be on strictly communal lines, the composition ofthe Upper House would ensure that no purely communal legislation would pass.The Administration would have present with it always an impartial balancingfactor to check communalism in the Executive, while the ultimate decision on policy would not be decided by a purely communal majority.The Governor in the case of a British possession would become a constitu-tional Governor as in a Dominion. His duty and reserve power of protectingminorities would pass to the additional Minister.Suppose such a system applied to Palestine, Jews and Arabs would probablybe able to agree on a C hristian, preferably from a country which had no Moslemsubjects and no, or a negligible, Jewish population. If they preferred it theymight choose a Chinaman. Applied to Ireland, Catholics and Protestants might agree on a high-minded Gallic.In the case of a Federal State where the units are unequal, the additionalMinister would be required only at the Centre.The suggestion may seem fantastic and academic, but it is designed to meetthe case of two rival communities who desire self-government, but cannot trusteach other. They, therefore, will have to pay the price for their intransigence.It might well happen that, the communal issue being provided for, parties on lines of urban and rural interests or capital and labour might spring up in bothcommunities. Thus, conceivably, in Palestine a Labour or a Conservative partymight be formed among both Jews and Arabs. There might be a Governmentchosen in this way which would, as far as economic interests are concerned, behomogeneous, but they would still need the balancing factor to prevent communaldomination.This suggestion would seem applicable where there are only two communities,the thing becomes more complicated where there are more than two. In Ceylonthere are Sinhalese, Burghers and Tamils, but the balance in the Government and
in the Upper House would here be Sinhalese as against the minorities, for it isqua minorities that they need protection.In India the position is more difficult owing to the multiplicity of communi-ties. While the main contest is between Hindus and Moslems, there are also theSikhs and the depressed classes, who are in some respects part of the Hinducommunity. It might here be necessary to have more than one balancing factorand perhaps to have some balancing factors in the Upper House. There is theadditional complications of the Princes and the interests of the various provinces.While, as is illustrated above, the difficulty of applying democratic principlesis acute where the rival communities are not at widely different cultural levels,it is still more intractable where they are so divergent. In all the Colonies, wherethere are co-existent a settled white community and a much larger Africanpopulation, as in the West Indies, Kenya and South Africa, the problem of devising within a measurable period a form of democratic constitution is not easy. We should not, I think, accept the solution afforded by the Southern Statesof the American Union, which operates through a complete divorce between theoryand practice.There is clearly no ready-made device for meeting all these varied difficulties,but I submit that the matter requires careful study. We ought to try by every means to clear from the minds of our own people the assumption that these thingscan be dealt with by the acceptance-of certain principles without regard to theirpractical application. We ought to try to make them realise that the successfulworking of democracy requires not the framing of paper Constitutions and theacceptance of dogmas, but an attitude of mind on the part of the citizens which requires in many instances to be created.
