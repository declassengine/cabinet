(43) 153.April 14, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document -WAR CABINET.FIFTH REPORT BY THE SHIPPING COMMITTEE.1. IN our Fourth Report, issued in January (W.P. (43) 28, also L.P. (43) 13and S.C. (43) 9), we reviewed in detail the shipping prospects for the first halfof 1943. In the present Report, we attempt to extend this review to cover theyear- as a whole.2. When our Fourth Report was written, it was thought that imports in thefirst half of 1943 (apart from direct American assistance to our import pro-gramme) might amount to some 8-2 million tons, and that the reduction ofshipments to the Indian Ocean Area to the level of forty ships a month in the first-half of 1943 might yield an additional 2 million, making a total of 10-2 million tons. It is now expected that imports, exclusive of direct American assistance,will amount to some 9-4 million tons. This reduction is largely due toexceptionally bad weather, to additional calls on shipping on account of the&quot; Torch &quot; operation, and to inability to draw from the North Atlantic seaboardas high a proportion of imports as had been expected. Including direct american assistance, imports should amount to some 11 million tons in the first half ofthe year.3. Imports for the year as a whole will largely depend on (a) the developmentof military operations, (b) the extent of United States shipping assistance both toour import programme and to our military requirements and, to a lesser extent,(c) the date at which the Mediterranean will be open as a regular route for cargoshipping.4. We have assumed that the Mediterranean will be open from the1st August, and that sailings from United Kingdom and United States to theEastern Mediterranean and Indian Ocean areas, including the regular UnitedStates allocation of 27 ships a month, will be raised from their present level of40 ships a month to 66 ships a month in the second half of 1943. We have notdissented from the estimate of requirements for these areas put forward by theWar Office, as there is some reason to believe that the reduction of the normal pro-grammes since January has imposed a heavy strain on reserves in these theatres,and that if some relaxation on the present restrictions is not granted theconsequences may be serious. In the case of India, for instance, it is reported bythe Cornniander-in-Chief that the readiness of our land forces for futureoffensive operations will be impaired, and labour troubles and civil and politicaldiscontent may make the country unsuitable as a base for future use. The wholequestion of the allocation of shipping for military purposes is now being discussed in Washington by representatives of the British and American shippingauthorities and Services. In the meantime, we have allowed for an increase onthe present low level of shipments.Imports.[25298]r,
5. We have also assumed the fulfilment of the American offer made tothe Foreign Secretary on the occasion of his recent visit to the United States tosupply direct assistance to United Kingdom dry cargo imports to the extent of  million tons Of imports over the year.6. On this basis we estimate that imports in 194:-) may be in the vicinity of26 million tons. 11 million tuns in the first half and 15 million tons in the second half of the year. (The assumptions underlying this estimate are set forth in greater detail in Appendix &apos;&quot; A.&quot;)7. We think it necessary to emphasise the fact that the estimates of UnitedKingdom importing capacity submitted in this report, besides allowing for civilrequirements of overseas territories, provide only for those military requirements(operational and maintenance) which can be regarded as involving firm eommit-ments of British-controlled tonnage.8. If additional demands were to he made upon British-controlled tonnage,either for a faster rate of build-up in the Indian Ocean area or for other purposes,the result would inevitably he to reduce our capacity to import into the UnitedKingdom.9. As an illustration, it can be roughly assumed that for every 10 shipsdiverted from the North Atlantic and sent to India or the Middle East from theUnited Kingdom or North America during the next four months, additional tothose already allowed for. there would be a loss to United Kingdom imports in1943 of some 200.000 tons.Import Requirements.10. In our Fourth Report United Kingdom Import Requirements for 1943were set at 27 million tons. Xow. mainly owing to a decline in the probableimports of Munitions and Miscellaneous, they have been reduced to a figure which,as the following Table shows, exceeds by a few hundred thousand tons the estimateof imports given above..1/ ill ion Inns.Food.

Net consumption of both imported food and materials is expected tobe lower than in any previous war year. As regards food, the decline in comparison with 1942 is partly clue to changes in character of the diet, but mainly to expansion of home agriculture. As regards materials, the decline ascompared with 1942 is small. Owing, however, to recent pruning of war produc-tion programmes there has been a substantial decline on the consumptionoriginally planned for 1943.12.   Target food stocks for end-1943 are, as shown in the above Table,600,000 tons (or 10 per cent.) more than those held at the end of 1942, which in turn were slightly below the minimum level deemed necessary by the Minister ofv Food for that time of year.   Target end-1943 stocks of materials, on the other^,0$$ t^v^and,-are]/[gn-]ft4eyeHvitb--tho ctooho at ond h012, bekig 2-7 million tons (or 27 perki^dU*-^f&apos;ent.) above the distributional levels as estimated in our Third Report (W.P. (42)-    /497 or S.C. (42) 75).13. We. think it desirable to aim at an end-1943 stock position which will allow for a later diversion of importing tonnage for military purposes, with a consequential drain on stocks. In the case of food there is the additional reason/ for building stocks above minimum levels that military operations in Europe maywell necessitate temporarily drawing on stocks of food in the United Kingdom tomeet minimum civilian needs in the liberated areas.
18. At the present time the Ministry of War Transport, in accordance withthe decision of the Lord Presidents Committee (see W.P. (43) 46, paragraph 7),is attempting to secure to the Ministry of Food an import of 5 million tons in thefirst half of this year, leaving the balance of the import to the Ministry ofProduction. We feel that it is still too early to say whether imports in the second half of 1943 will be sufficient to warrant the Ministry of Food having their targetimport of 11 million tons for the year, and we therefore recommend that in themeantime the Ministry of War Transport should endeavour to secure to them,on the same priority basis as before, an import for the year of 10-5 million tons.19. At the present stage of the war no increase in our imports is possible without trenching either on our own military requirements or on american military demands or on supplies to Russia. Our own import requirements haveto be set at the lowest figure compatible with safety. On the other hand, we mustnot run down our stocks prematurely or allow our United Kingdom war produc-tion to be interfered with unless compensating military advantage can thereby be attained. The day will come when we shall need to take risks with our production and live upon our stocks iii order to strike a decisive blow at the enemy to end the war. Meanwhile, in considering any further calls on new tonnage formilitary purposes, a balance will have to be struck between immediate operationaladvantage and the long-run military advantage of maintaining war production,and a reasonable stock position.Signed on behalf of the Committee :HARCOURT JOHNSTON E,Chairman.Offices of the War Cabinet.April 14, 1943.[25298]14. Moreover, the experience in the four months beginning November 1942,when partly as a result of the drain on shipping occasioned by &quot; Torch &quot; stocksof imported food and materials declined by 2-2 million tons, is sufficient to showthat the margin of safety contained in these target stocks for end-1943 is none too large. As a result of this decline in stocks in the early months of 1943 a declinewhich will probably continue until April or May stocks will have to recoyer^by,substantially more than the amounts shown in the Table in paragraph 10 if they/ y^^&apos;are to reach target levels by the end of the year. (Appendix &quot; C &quot; illustrates by v &apos;Xx^s*Jgraphs the movements in stocks of food and materials over the past few years,together with the probable level of stocks at the end of the year, should importsamount to 26 million tons, and should they be divided up between Departments inthe manner suggested in paragraphs 15 and 17 below.)15. As we have seen in paragraph 5, an import of 26 millions would fall short of our requirements by 400,000 tons. How is the deficit to be met? On theassumption that the present food policy remains unchanged, any reduction in food imports would be bound to result in a depletion of stocks, and, since targetfood&apos;stocks for end-1943 are only 550,000 tons above the minimum, there is verylittle elbow-room here. We therefore consider that the deficit of 400,000 tonsreferred to above should be allowed to fall entirely upon the import progTammeof the Ministry of Production.16. Should, however, the deficit prove to be much larger than is hereenvisaged, food imports would have to take their share of the burden, though the brunt of the fall in imports would still have to be borne by raw materials. Themain footnote to Table I of Appendix B shows the? adaptations which would haveto be made in the end-1943 stocks of various foodstuffs if food imports were reduced from 11 to 10-5 million tons. As regards materials, a substantial partof any decline in imports would, probably fall on current consumption, as it is thepolicy of the Ministry of Production to reverse the present downward trend of stocks and rebuild them at the earliest possible date to a sufficient level so that wemay be ready to face a diversion of shipping from the United Kingdom import programme to a major military operation without disastrous interference withvital production.Conclusions and Recommendations.17. We recommend that, of a total import of 26 million tons in 1943,.11 million tons should be regarded as the appropriate share of the Ministry of

An averageof 1-75 million d.w. tons of British-controlled shipping will beemployed in this way.(/) That 1-9 million d.w. tons will be employed for various other military purposes, including &quot; Torch maintenance, supplies to Russia, and mediterranean shipping required for supplies to Turkey.(g) That the Mediterranean will be open for&apos; regular convoys of cargoshipping as from the 1st August, 1943.(h) That the geographical distribution of sources from which imports willbe drawn will be as shown in Appendix I of S.C. (43) 54.(i) That direct United States assistance to the United Kingdom import programme will amount to 7 million tons of imports over the year.
