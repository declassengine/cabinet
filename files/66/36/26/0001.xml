E.Foreign Office, April 24, 1943.Internal Situation in Italy.Attitude of the People.THE succession of Axis defeats since last November, first in North africa and later in Russia, and the bombing of Italy by the R.A.F. and the U.S.A.A.F.,have had a cumulative effect on Italian morale, but all other events have now fadedinto the background in comparison with the situation in Tunisia. There seemsto be an almost universal conviction that the loss of the whole of Africa is onlya matter of time and that the Axis cannot now hope to win the war. Nor wouldan Axis defeat be unwelcome to the majority of the population; the chief waraim of the Italians now is peace. Moreover, an appreciable number of Italiansis convinced that an Axis victory would entail Italy&apos;s permanent subservienceto Germany and is therefore less desirable than an Allied victory. One of themost striking features about the state of feeling in Italy is the comparative lackof hostility towards the British and Americans. This attitude does not seem tohave been seriously affected by the recent heavy bonibing attacks on Italian citiesand attempts of Italian propaganda to make capital of the civilian casualties and residential damage which have been caused appear to have been ineffective.At the same time these attacks have necessitated large-scale evacuation and haveaggravated distribution difficulties as a result of the local disruption of communications. The net result appears to have been a deepening of the prevailing gloom in the bombed areas and accentuated war-weariness.2. The question arises whether there is any likelihood of an automaticinternal collapse in Italy, or whether the probability is that Italy will remain inthe war until militarily defeated. We must also reckon with the possibility ofan organised revolt against the regime and the Germans, of which the inevitableconsequence would be that Italy would cease to take part in the war. There isalso the possibility that, before automatic disintegration has come about or Italy has been militarily defeated, overtures for peace or armistice terms may be made.And, finally, disintegration may come about as a result of an increase in passive resistance on the part of the administration and the people.12018   [25352]
Prospects of an Automatic internal Collapse.3. There is no doubt that the internal situation in Italy is progressivelydeteriorating. The machinery of government is very strained, and corruption,which has always been widespread, appears to be increasing. On the other hand,the transport position, although there is little margin of safety, has been adapted to war needs reasonably well. The food situation, though possibly worse thanappears on the surface, is better this season than last year owing to the mildwinter, and should give the regime no immediate cause for alarm. this improvement may even be due to some extent to the black market, which is now so universal that it caters for the poor as well as the rich. Moreover, the recentGovernment changes have strengthened Mussolini&apos;s own position by giving himdirect control of all important offices and surrounding him with &quot; yes-men.&quot;4. The most likely factor which could lead to an automatic collapse in italy is probably the shock and despair which the loss of Tunisia will undoubtedlycause. A contributory factor might well be &apos; extensive bombing leading to serious local break-downs both of transport and the distribution of food supplies.It is possible that this in its turn would lead to a general failure of the admin-istration throughout the country and a general state of chaos might then ensue.It must be emphasised, however, that these are merely hypotheses. The balance ofprobability is that the Fascist regime will succeed in holding the position afterthe loss of Tunisia, especially if the Germans intervene and take control.Possibilities of ait organised revolt.5. There is at present no organised resistance to the regime. The Com-munists are believed to be organised on party lines but they operate only inisolated cells. There are a number of &quot;intellectual&quot; Communists in the universities, and there is some reason to think that the doctrine is having some success among the industrial workers of the north (where Communism lias never been entirely stamped out since 1922).. But the Italian people are not tempera-mentally suited to Communism, and it is noteworthy how little success the bolshevist bogey, strenuously exploited by the Fascist Government, has had in italy. There is. however, considerable fear among the propertied classes of thechaos, sometimes identified with Bolshevism, which might follow the overthrowof the regime. This fear would deter large sections of the population fromsupporting a movement initiated by any subversive organisation.6. Certain underground organisations are in existence but, although thereare indications that these organisations are showing greater strength of purpose,there is no reason to believe that they have as yet sufficiently strong a followingto mobilise feeling against the regime. Mussolini is still in a position to throttleany incipient movement against the regime largely through the Italian secretpolice which has recently increased in efficiency and activity. Another factor which weighs against a popular revolt against the regime is fear among allclasses in Italy of German reactions. The belief in German invincibility has beenbadly shaken by recent events, but the fear is still widespread that an attempt at revolt might result in a German occupation and there is a conviction that if italy tried to cut adrift from the Axis intensive German bombing attacks onItalian cities would immediately follow. This conduces to the feeling that itis best for Italy to hang on until Germany cracks and the clanger of a german occupation is removed. It may, however, be expected that with each further day ofwar the general disquiet will increase. Moreover, according as Germanybecomes stretched for troops, the fear of a German occupation will diminish, andthe population will give less weight to this deterrent to revolt. The situation,as in the case of the prospects of an automatic collapse, will thus be largely affectedby the time factor.7. Another way in which organised revolt against the regime might come about is through the instrumentality of the House of Savoy or the Army, eithersingly or in unison, taking a lead.   This question is discussed below.Attitude of the Population in the event of an Allied Invasion.8. The reaction of the civilian population to an Allied invasion cannot bedetermined with certainty. Reports of British subjects recently repatriatedfrom Italy have been almost unanimous in declaring that war-weariness has reached such a pitch that an Allied invasion would be welcomed by the popula-tion.   After making allowances for exaggeration, it would not seem unreasonable
Lo suppose that, provided the landings were made in overwhelming force, theAllies would not encounter whole-hearted opposition from the civilian population.On the other hand, it is possible that the imminent threat of invasion wouldovercome the dissatisfaction felt for the regime and would rally the Italianpeople in the defence of their country. Italian troops, as-opposed to civilians,might, in any case, be counted on to show more determination in the defence ofItaly. But the Italian army now seem to share the conviction, of the civiliansthat an Axis victory is impossible, and initial Allied successes on landing wouldcertainly lower their will to resist (see also paragraph 13 below). Morale in theair force remains comparatively good, and the regime could probably count on them to offer determined initial resistance to an Allied invasion of Italy. In thenavy and mercantile marine, while collective morale remains at the same low levelsince the Battle of Cape Matapan, individually it still preserves plenty of spirit.Overtures for an A rmistice or Peace.9. The prospects of such a move being made will be affected by the time factor; they will increase in direct ratio as Germany encounters mountingdifficulties on the Eastern Front and we continue to have successes in north africa. Overtures for a separate peace might come from the followingquarters:  (1) The King or other members of the Royal Family.(2) Prominent persons or groups, e.g., opportunist Fascists, industrialistsand financiers.(3) The Army, led by Badoglio or some other general.10. The King, who is old and indecisive, is said to believe that he must continue to support Mussolini, since the latter&apos;s removal would lead to quarrelsbetween rival groups and to political anarchy. This view must have been strengthened by the Cabinet changes which have eliminated all the ministers with any ability who might have carried on a Government in the event of mussolini&apos;s disappearance. Amongst the people the King is generally regarded with pity or indifference for his supine attitude, and he would probably notsurvive Italy&apos;s defeat; at the same time, loyalty to the House of Savoy has by nomeans disappeared, its part in the unification of Italy being remembered, and itseems very probable that a constitutional monarchy would be generally acceptableafter the overthrow of the regime if it offered a prospect of stable government orthe only alternative to anarchy.The Crown Prince has in the past been mentioned as a possible successor toMussolini as head of the Fascist Party, but there have recently been indications that he has been trying to dissociate himself from the regime and there is some reason to believe that he and his wife, who is the stronger character of the two,may be planning a move against the regime, probably with assistance from thearmy, after the loss of Tunisia.11. Opportunist Fascists, such as Grandi, and the industrialists andfinanciers, like Count Volpi, may be considered together since they constitute theso-called &quot; peace group.&quot; This group has so far shown no signs of initiating arevolt nor can it be considered likely that they would do so. They would only actfrom purely selfish motives and not from any arAi-Fascist conviction, and theywould in any case be able to count on little organised or effective support in thecountry since they would not automatically have the backing of the army. Itseems unlikely, therefore, that they would jeopardise their own safety byinitiating a movement against the regime.12. If the army were to make a move, Badoglio would be the most naturalleader of it. He is generally regarded as a man of integrity and the commonpeople appear to have an unreasoning hope that he may be able to get them outof their difficulties. There seems to be less confidence among the educated classesthat he could evade the close watch which is kept on him. Nevertheless, the army is at once the most powerful force in the State and the one over which Mussolinihas least control, since its loyalty is directed towards the Crown rather thantowards Mussolini or the Party. Jealousy of the Fascist Militia, which owesallegiance to Mussolini, would predispose the rank and file to participate in a move against the regime if they were convinced that on wider grounds it was desirable. It is not known what support in the army Badoglio could commandbut if he were acting in the King&apos;s name it might be considerable. Apart fromBadoglio the only name which has been seriously mentioned is that of Marshal
calviglia. He is now a very old man but is said to be still active. We know of noother army leaders who might be expected to lead a revolt. After twenty yearsof Fascism the Generals are likely to be either politically harmless or mere partynominees.13. Morale in the army has hitherto been somewhat higher than in the civilian population but it seems now to have fallen to the same low level. TheGermans have always been disliked and this feeling has been intensified by theway in which they have abandoned Italian troops to their fate both in north africa and in Russia. There is the same conviction in the army as amongst the civilian population that an Axis victory is now improbable and there is no greatenthusiasm for a war which is not thought to be in Italy&apos;s interest. Failing a lead from above the rank and file are not likely to make any move but the military effort will probably decrease progressively.Possible Developments.14. An automatic internal collapse in Italy appears unlikely at this moment,but becomes more likely as the war goes on, provided it develops along the linesof German defeats in the Soviet Union and British successes in North Africa.We cannot count on any organised revolt against the regime being successfullyorganised by the Communist party or such subsersive organisations as exist. Weshould not exclude the possibility of a peace party with a sufficient influencearising and being willing to conclude armistice or peace terms. Such a moveseems most likely to come from the Army leaders. The extent to which it would entail having dealings with the Fascist regime is doubtful, but if the move came from a man such as Badoglio the balance of probability is that we should berequired to recognise the continuance of the Monarchy rather than thecontinuance of the regime.15. Finally, perhaps the most probable course which events might take isthat the disintegration of Italy will not come about by a collapse of the regime ora revolt against it, but that we may witness a growing tendency on the part ofboth the administration and the people to resort to passive resistance andobstruction in their dealings with Germany until the point is reached when, inpractice, Italy will no longer be taking part in the war and the Germans will notbe in a position to use sufficient compulsion to force them back into it.A.
