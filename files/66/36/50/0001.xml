Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.SECRET. Copy. No.W.P. (43) 200.May 10. 1943.WAR CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary or State for Foreign Affairs.I HAVE no wish to press my colleagues to take any major decision on ourPalestine policy at this moment, and I agree that the present Cabinet are notdebarred from reconsidering the 1939 White Paper when the time comes for so doing. But I think it necessary that my colleagues should be aware of thedisquieting developments which are now taking place, not only in Palestine,as pointed out by the Colonial Secretary, but also in Egypt, Iraq, Syria andArabia, as a result of the revival of Zionist and Arab activities. I thereforecirculate the annexed note, in which I suggest, as the only action which appearspracticable at this stage, an approach to the United States Government withthe object of inducing them to do their best to damp down pro-Zionist utterancesby American public men, such as are havine- unfortunate repercussions on our interests in the Middle East, though in America they may appear innocuous.A. E.Foreign Office, May 10, 1943.. annex the paper circulated by the Colonial Secretary (W.P. (43) 192) gives an account of the deterioration of the situation in Palestine during recent months.But it is not only in Palestine that the revival of Zionist and Arab activities mayhave dangerous repercussions on British interests. Over a wider field, evidenceof growing uneasiness in the Arab world continues to reach us from many sourcesat a moment when our military forces in the Middle East are preoccupied, and tosome extent weakened, by the imminence of new tasks. As we were warned byHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Bagdad in a telegram dated the 13th March, it isclear that we are now witnessing the first, but rapidly developing, symptoms of a major nationalistic revival in the Middle East covering the two contending forces,Arabism and Zionism. The primary responsibility for the provoking of a tensionwhich cannot safely be ignored lies, in my judgment, with the Zionist propa-ganclists in the United States.The first and most obvious reason for the revival of Arab and Jewishcontroversy is the removal of the immediate threat of war from the Middle Eastand the consequent belief not only that politics can be played with safety, butthat steps should be taken in good time to formulate claims and secure a hearingat the eventual peace conference. This motive was clearly uppermost in the minds of the Iraqi Government in declaring war on the Axis in Janauary last. It hasalso been in the minds of Zionists, for His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washingtonhas lately reported that recent activities of American Jewry have borne out to a remarkable degree a prognostication made some time ago by the HighCommissioner for Palestine that Jewish agitation would become most active atthe moment when victory for the United Nations was clearly certain but not yetactually achieved. I do not suggest that there is anything unexpected or unusualin this, nor that there is much that we can do except to continue to impress uponArab Governments and Jewish organisations that the requirements of the war effort must remain the dominant consideration.There is, however, a second special reason for the present revival of theArab-Jewish controversy in the Middle East: it is the intensification of Zionist12031   [25425]
activities in the United States of America. This we know is not fortuitous,but a matter of policy. In 1941, the Censorship, unknown to the Jewish Agency,intercepted certain papers expressing the views of leading members that duringthe war the Agency should do no more in this country than prevent His Majesty&apos;sGovernment entering into any new commitment to the Arabs, but that as theUnited States Government might be expected to play a dominant role at the endof the war, American support for Zionist aims might be the key to their success,and as a consequence all efforts should be concentrated in the United States.This policy has been carried out in the months which have since elapsed, andas was to be anticipated has been greatly accelerated since our victory at ElAlamein. The adoption by the Zionists of the &quot; Biltmore &quot; Resolutions,advocating (a).a Jewish national army, (b) the recognition of Palestine as a JewishCommonwealth, and (c) Zionist control of Jewish immigration into Palestine, was naturally followed by widespread propaganda in the United States in support ofthese three aims. While Mr. Hull and the State Department generally have beencareful to avoid committing themselves on these issues, other members of theAdministration have been less cautious. - The Secretaries of War and of the Navy,Mr. Stimson and Colonel Knox, have given their signatures in support of theformation of a Jewish Army, and in January His Majesty Js Ambassador atWashington, reported that the American Committee for a Jewish Army weresecuring the signatures of large numbers of eminent Americans, including servingUnited States officials, and were publishing them in huge advertisements in theUnited States press. In March the Secretary of the Interior. Mr. Ickes, stated ina speech at Boston that &quot; the United Nations should declare once and for all that palestine shall be a home for those Jews who wish to abide there not a place ofexile a respected and self-respecting member of the Commonwealth of Nations.&quot;Apart from members of the Administration, Mr. Wendel Willkie sent a message on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Balfour Declaration, which fell last november, saying that &apos;&quot; the doors of Palestine must be opened to the Jewishpeoples of Central and Eastern Europe after the war.&quot; For the same occasion240 Senators and members of the House of Representatives submitted a declara-tion to the President and to Mr. Hull reaffirming the traditional policy of theUnited States to favour the restoration of the Jewish national home in Palestine.By this they made it plain that they had in mind that large numbers of themillions of Jews in Europe who had been uprooted should be given an opportunityto reconstruct their lives in Palestine.How much this all means to the Americans themselves may be questioned.There is evidence that some of the Jewish Agency&apos;s leaders who organised the campaign regard the results as disappointing, and that anti-Jewish feeling is increasing markedly in the United States. Nevertheless, the campaign has hadthe outward appearances of success, and has led to a corresponding increase ofanxiety not only in Palestine itself but in other Arab countries about the intentions of the United Nations for the future of Palestine. There is a persistent beliefamong the Arabs that, as regards Palestine, Jewish influence predominates in theUnited States, and it has been widely argued that such statements as Mr. Willkie&apos;were contrary to the Atlantic Charter, and that there was little point in supporting the Allies if victory was to result in Palestine being handed over tothe Jews.&quot; It must be remembered that for over twenty years Arab opinion hasbecome steadily more embittered by our policy in Palestine. An uneasy peacehad been brought to Palestine by the publication of the White Paper in 1939. andin all the circumstances we may consider ourselves fortunate that, in spite of thedark days through which we have passed, nothing worse befell us in the middle east than the abortive Iraqi rebellion of May 1941.Arab leaders in Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia have manifested their interest and uneasiness in many ways. In January the Egyptian Prime Ministersent a memorandum to the State Department emphasising the interest whichEgypt took in the. fate of Palestine and pointing out the difficulties that wouldbe created if responsible persons in the United States made any promises or publicdeclarations in favour of the Zionists. Nahas Pasha followed this up with another memorandum on the subject of the forthcoming conference on refugees,and drew attention to the impossibility of allowing the immigration into palestine of those Jews that might be rescued from Europe. Meanwhile, the iraqi Prime Minister approached Ibn Saud with a proposal that the ArabGovernments should make joint representations to His Majesty&apos;s Government onthe subject of Jewish activities, which, he said, were now being conducted on agreater and more dangerous scale than ever before, especially in the UnitedStates. He suggested that it was necessary for the Arabs to start a propaganda campaign in the United States, so that public opinion in that country should be
aware that the Arabs had as strong feelings about Palestine as the Jews.General Nuri also addressed a long memorandum to the Minister of State giving his interpretation of the problems and putting forward his suggestions for theirsolution. In his covering letter General Nuri suggested that the United nations should make a definite pronouncement now that they will not support the creationof a Jewish State in Palestine. He pointed out that, if the Zionists and theirsympathisers were allowed to continue their propaganda, it would be verydifficult for Arab rulers to restrain Arab journalists and politicians frominitiating counter-propaganda in the Arab States.In accordance with his usual practice in matters of mutual concern, ibn saud has sought the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this question. Hesaid that he was anxious to do nothing to embarrass His Majesty&apos;s Government,but he could not in present circumstances ignore all the discussion that was going on. He was as much concerned about Palestine as General Nuri or any other arab, but he had faith in His Majesty&apos;s Governments past assurances and didnot doubt that they would find a solution which, would do justice to the Arabs.Both the Iraqi and Egyptian Prime Ministers are at present considering theconvocation of an Arab conference to reach agreement on an Arab programme.If such a conference is held, the future of Palestine cannot fail to hold a prominent place in the discussions, and, though both Prime Ministers haveexpressed a desire that the proceedings should be confidential, the knowledge thatthey are taking place would probably cause excitement in the Arab countries and.lead to a public demand for a declaration from His Majesty&apos;s government regarding their&apos; future policy.In these circumstances, and in view of the hopes which the Zionists reposeon the United States, it would seem wise to exploit the warning that PresidentRoosevelCs Administration have received from their own agent, Colonel Hoskins,whose views on the likelihood of an early Arab-Jewish clash are set out inparagraph 6 of the enclosure to the Colonial Secretary&apos;s memorandum. HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington has from time to time impressed, on members of the Administration with varying success the anxiety that HisMajesty&apos;s Government feel as regards the support given in the United States tothe Zionist programme. I would suggest to my colleagues that the time has comefor a more formal warming, and that we should inform the United StatesGovernment that the apparent success achieved by Zionist propaganda in Americarisks creating a. serious handicap to the war effort. It is clear that Zionistpropaganda inevitably provokes Arab reactions, and this tendency, if unchecked,may lead to serious disturbances not only in Palestine, but also in neighbouring arab countries. The United Nations cannot contemplate with equanimity thepossibility of such disturbances, especially at a critical period of the war when their military resources must be concentrated to the greatest possible extent on themilitary operations against the Axis Powers. As the Embassy at Washingtonreported on the 9th March :  &quot; The proper course is for the Administration to speak severely toZionist leaders here in private, and. to tell them to keep their mouths shut ifthey do not wish to endanger the security of the Jewish settlements inPalestine, and indeed the standing of the Jews in the United States itself.The Administration should also try to discourage prominent men fromsigning proclamations about a Jewish Army, which they do all too easilywithout thinking of the effect that their signatures have in the Near East;and at least an attempt should, be made to induce the Secretaries of Warand Navy to refrain from endorsing such proclamations.&quot;An appeal to the United States Government to act on these lines should not fall wholly on deaf ears, since the American Commissioner for Refugees,Mr. Myron Taylor, recently informed His Majesty &apos;s Ambassador that he &quot;had spoken to some of the principal Jews in New York about the desirability of theirplaying down any agitation about Palestine, on the ground that, if the question was unwisely handled in America, it must have undesirable reactions among theArabs. More moderate Jewish opinion in the United States of America, suchas the American Jewish Committee and the American Council for Judaism, wouldalso welcome such action by the United States Government.We might conclude our representations to the United States Governmentwith an explanation of our reluctance, unless it should become essential, to makea declaration regarding the future of Palestine, whether or not &quot;in the exact sensesuggested by General Nuri, in order to calm the Arab world.
