THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET.(i)Premier Stalin to Premier Churchill, dated April 21. 1943.(Personal and Most Secret.)The Soviet Government considers that the attitude taken of late by the PolishGovernment vis-a-vis the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is completelyabnormal and contradicts all the rules and usages of relations between the twoAllied States.2. The slanderous campaign hostile to the Soviet Union started by theGerman Fascists in connexion with the murder of the Polish officers nearSmolensk perpetrated by themselves on the territory occupied by the german troops was immediately seized by the Government of General Sikorski and isbeing avidly fanned by the Polish Governmental press. The Government ofGeneral Sikorski has not only not treated the vile Fascist calumny against theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics with the contempt it deserves, but it didnot find it necessary even to put any question in this connexion to the SovietGovernment or ask for any explanation.3. The Hitlerite authorities after perpetrating a monstrous crime againstthe Polish officers are staging now a comedy of &quot; investigation &quot; in which theyuse some of the Polish pro-Fascist elements carefully selected by the Germans.In the occupied Poland, where everything is under Flitlers heel, no honest Polecan say a word openly.4. The International Red Cross is called for the purpose of this &quot; investiga-tion &quot; by both the Hitler Government and the Polish Government. In the atmosphere of terror, with its gallows and mass extermination of peacefulpopulation, the International Red Cross is forced to take part in the comedy of&quot; investigation &quot; of which the producer is tlitler. It is obvious that such&quot; investigation &quot; conducted in addition behind the back of the Soviet Govern-ment cannot be trusted by any honest man.5. The fact that the campaign hostile to the Union of Soviet socialist republics broke out simultaneously in the German and Polish press, and isbeing conducted in the same direction, cannot leave any doubt that between theenemy of the Allies Hitler and the Government of General Sikorski thereexist contact and understanding with regard to this hostile campaign6. At a time when the peoples of the Soviet Union are sheding [sic] theirblood in the most difficult struggle against Hitler Germany [sic&apos;] and making thegreatest possible efforts to defeat the common foe of all the freedom-lovingdemocratic countries, the Government of General Sikorski delivers a treacherousblow to the Soviet Union to serve the cause of FIitler&apos;s tyranny.7. All these circumstances compel the Soviet Government to state that thepresent Polish Government which descended so low as to come to an understanding with Hitler Government [sic] put de facto an end to the Allied relations withthe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and took up a position of hostility to the-Soviet Union.8. In view of the foregoing the Soviet Government came to the conclusionthat it is necessary to interrupt relations with this Government.9. I feel it incumbent upon me to inform you on the above and I hope thatthe British Government will understand the necessity of this step which was forced on the Soviet Government,
(hi)Prim&apos;&apos; Minister to Premier Stalin, dated April 25, 1943.^Personal and Most Secret.)Air. Eden saw General Sikorski yesterday evening. Sikorski stated that,so far from synchronising his appeal to the- Rod Cross with that of the Germans,his Government took the initiative without knowing what line the Germans wouldtake. In fact, the Germans acted after hearing the Polish broadcast announce-ment. Sikorski also told Eden that his Government had simultaneouslyapproached M. Bogomolov on the subject. Sikorski emphasised that previouslyhe had several times raised this question of the missing officers with the SovietGovernment and once with you personally. On his instructions the PolishMinister of Information in his broadcasts has reacted strongly against german propaganda and this has brought an angry German reply.2. As a result of Eden&apos;s strong representations Sikorski has undertakennot to press request for Red Cross investigation and will so inform the Red Crossauthorities in Berne. He will also restrain Polish Press from polemics. In this connexion I am examining possibility of silencing those Polish papers in thiscountry which attack Soviet Government and at the same time attack Sikorski fortrying to work with the Soviet Government.3. In view of Sikorski&apos;s undertaking I would now urge you to abandon ideaof any interruption of relations.4. I have reflected further on this matter and I am more than ever convincedthat it can only assist our enemies if there is a break between the Soviet and polish Governments. German propaganda has produced this story precisely inorder to make a rift in the ranks of the United Nations and to lend some sem-blance of reality to its new attempts to persuade the world that the interests ofEurope and the smaller nations are being defended by Germany against thegreat extra-European Powers, namely, the U.S.S.R., the U.S.A. and the BritishEmpire.5. I know General Sikorski well, and I am convinced that no contacts orunderstanding could exist between him or his Government and our common enemy,Prime Minister to Premier Stalin, dated April 24, 1943.(Personal and Most Secret.)Ambassador Maisky delivered your message to me last night. We shall certainly oppose rigorously any &quot; investigation by the International Red Crossor any other body in any territory under German authority. Such investigationwould be a fraud and its conclusions reached by terrorism. Mr. Eden is seeingSikorski to-day and will press him as strongly as possible to withdraw allcountenance from any investigation under Nazi auspices. Also, we should neverapprove of any parley with the Germans or contact with them of any kindwhatever, and we shall press this point upon our Polish Allies.2. I will wire you later how Sikorski reacts to the above points. Hisposition is one of great difficulty. Far from being pro-German or in league withthem, he is in danger of being overthrown by Poles who consider he has not stoodup sufficiently for his people against the Soviets. If he should go, we should onlyget somebody worse. I hope therefore that your decision to &quot; interrupt &quot; relationsis to be read in the sense of a final warning rather than of a break and that it willnot be made public at any rate till every other plan has been tried. The public announcement of a break would do the greatest possible harm in the United States,where the Poles are numerous and influential.3. I had drafted a telegram to you yesterday asking you to consider allowingmore Poles and Polish dependents to go into Persia. This would allay the risingdiscontent of the Polish Army formed there, and would enable me to influence thePolish Government to act in conformity with our common interests and againstthe common foe. I have deferred sending this telegram in consequence of yoursto me. in the hope that the situation may clear.
against whom he has led the Poles in bitter and uncompromising resistance. Hisappeal to the International Red Cross was clearly a mistake, though I am convinced it was not made in collusion with the Germans.6. Now that we have, I hope, cleared up the issue raised in your telegram to me, I want to revert to the proposals contained in my draft telegram to whichI referred in my message of the 24th April. I shall therefore shortly be sendingyou this earlier message in its original form. If we two were able to arrange thismatter of getting these Poles out of the Soviet Union it would be easier forSikorski to withdraw entirely from the position he has been forced by his publicopinion to adopt.   1 hope you will help me to achieve this.(iv)Premier Stalin to Premier Churchill, dated April 25, 1943.(Personal and Most Secret.)I received your message concerning the Polish affairs. Many thanks for your interest in the matter. I would like however to point out that the interruption of relations with the Polish Government is already decided andto-day V. M. Molotov delivered a note to this effect. Such action was demanded by my colleagues as the Polish official press is ceaselessly pursuing and even dailyexpanding, its campaign hostile to the U.S.S.R. I was obliged also to take intoaccount the public opinion of the Soviet Union which is deeply indignant at theingratitude and treachery of the Polish Government.2. With regard to the publication of the Soviet document concerning the interruption of relations with the Polish Government I am sorry to say that such,publication cannot be avoided.
