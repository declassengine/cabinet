(43) 148) about the British Union, a copy of a statement concerning thecontinued detention of British Union members, which was sent to the PrimeMinister by Sir Oswald Mosley (through his solicitors, Messrs. Oswald Hickson,Collier and Co.) in October 1942.H. M.. Home Office, April 21, 1943.STATEMENT   BY   SIR   OSWALD   MOSLEY   CONCERNING   THECONTINUED DETENTION OF &quot;BRITISH UNION&quot; MEMBERS.I write this Statement because some 86 per cent, of the British subjects ofBritish origin, arrested under the 18b Regulations, were members of british union with my leadership (vide figures in Hansard, Vol. 376, columns 850-860).For nearly two and a half years many of us have been held in gaols or camps,with the result that a number of people have been led to believe that we haveclone something disloyal to our country. In fact, nothing of the kind has beenalleged against us by the Government; because they have never suggested thatwe have done anything since the war except conduct a political campaign infavour of a negotiated Peace. Further, no one has contended that we have everbroken any law.Prior to the war we were denounced as an ultra-patriotic organisation. Forseven years before this war we maintained an unceasing campaign to obtain theproper and modern armament of our country, in the air, on the sea and on land.We opposed this war, but we strove for a British Empire strong against any possible attack; we stood for peace but also for strength. If anyone reallysuspects that we desire to bring about the defeat of our country, it may be replied,that a seven-years campaign to secure its armament against defeat is a strangebeginning to that design.To anyone who says that it is disloyal to oppose a war the best reply maybe made in the words of Mr. Lloyd George when he was opposing the Boer War :&apos;&apos; Is every politician who opposes a war during its progress of necessity atraitor? If so, Chatham was a traitor, and Burke and Fox especially; and in later times Cobden and Bright.&quot;[25329]
We can also summon to our aid the whole experience of British History inour reply to the insinuation that we may be rendered disloyal to our country byadherence to our National Socialist and Fascist creed, which -in a &quot; character,policy, form and method suited to this country alone &quot; we have long striven to persuade our fellow-countrymen to adopt, The fact that they were fighting the catholic power of Spain did not render British Catholics disloyal to their countryin the age of Queen Elizabeth. The fact that the ideas of the French Revolutionwere, in many respects, similar to their own ideas did not make distinguishedBritish Radicals disloyal to their country during the wars with Napoleon. still less does our creed, whose first tenet is love of country, make us disloyal to our country in the modern age. Those who allege such a change in the character ofEnglishmen impute a decline to which denial has been given in practical formby very many of our members who have served throughout the present war in theForces, and have fought bravely. It should also be stated that, within myknowledge, all of us in these gaols who were old.enough to fight in the last wardid in fact fight for our country in that war. For instance, beside me in thisgaol is a man who won both the D.S.O. and M.C. in the last war, but has served,with his wife, two and a half years in prisons and camps during this war, because he was a member of British Union.The loyalty of our members to our country is the natural result both of ourcreed and of our policy since the conflict began. For instance, after the declara-tion of war I published the following message to members of British Union :&quot; Our country is involved in war. Therefore I ask you to do nothing to injureour country, or to help any other Power. Our members should do what the lav-requires of them, and if they are members of any of the Forces or Services of theCrown, they should obey their orders, and, in every particular, obey the rules-oftheir Services.&quot; Such a message was the natural expression of our policy : &quot; Onthe one hand we wanted Peace; and, on the other hand, we wanted Peace with britain undefeated.&quot;It was never suggested to us in the spring of 1940 that we had no right toexercise full freedom of speech. The press supporting us did not receive the warning for which provision is made in the present law. Instead, the Govern-ment requested Parliament to pass a new Regulation which was apparentlydesigned specifically to enable members of our organisation to be imprisoned(vide Hansard, the 21st July, 1942, col. 1518). On the following day,&apos; the23rd May, 1940, we were thrown into gaol by virtue of this new Regulation, of whose very existence we were unaware. We were not arrested under the originalRegulation 18B (1), which provides, inter alia, for detention on account of alleged&quot;acts prejudicial to the public safety.&quot; We were arrested under the ad hocRegulation 18B (1) (a), which provided for the detention of anyone who was amember of an organisation whose leaders &quot; have had associations &quot; with theleaders of countries with which this country is now at war. That I had&quot; associations,&quot; before the war, of a perfectly legal and proper character, I have certainly never denied. I held it to be my duty, by personal contact or any otherproper means, to make whatever contribution I could to the maintenance and building of World Peace. Such &quot; associations &quot; before the war were perfectlylegal. I reiterate and emphasise that it has never been suggested by the Govern-ment that we have done anything since the Avar except carry on a politicalpropaganda. Is not 2^ years&apos; imprisonment for entirely legitimate proceedings at least sufficient for my supporters?For well over two years now our organisation has been banned, and it hasbeen made an offence in law to carry on our propaganda. Anyone continuingsuch propaganda can consequently be convicted in the courts and sentenced atthe most to two years&apos; imprisonment. Our principle has always been to obeythe law, as we have often stated. Under present law we can, in effect, be requiredto do whatever the Government of the day may desire.Over 80 per cent, of our members, who were originally arrested, have since been released and have performed various forms of national service withoutcomplaint against them. Those still detained are just the same kind of people;why keep them rotting in prison and camps ?In any case it is very wrong that our fellow-countrymen should be given any occasion to think that we have done something disloyal to our country duringthis war; while, in fact, during the private inquiry of the Government, nothing ofthe kind was suggested against us. No one can show that I or my friends haveever done anything disloyal to our country, and, given the opportunity, I willdefend myself at any time before the whole nation from any such suggestion, no matter from what quarter it may come.
To hold political opponents silent in gaol while a gross untruth is circulatedagainst them is a procedure that cannot be justified to History, even if the momentpermits it. Yet, that is the situation that has now been created, It should nothave arisen, as our detention was frequently described by the Government as&quot;Preventive,&quot; in contradiction to the allegation that we have done somethingdisloyal to justify imprisonment. Further, the Prime Minister has himself statedthat &quot;he was increasingly sceptical of the existence of a fifth column in thiscountry.&quot; But our prolonged imprisonment and the subsequent silence of theGovernment have since given the unscrupulous and the ignorant an opportunityof which full advantage has been taken. If we, and through us our dependants,are to suffer not only the miseries but also the slur of further imprisonment, i suggest that, in honour, the Government should state publicly whatever they haveto say against us, and that I should at least have the right to make a public reply.I take entire responsibility for the policy of British Union. All my actionsand principles I am prepared at any time to defend publicly before my fellow-countrymen.
