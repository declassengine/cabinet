During the week about 4,000 tons of shipping arrived in Tunisia from italy.   Some 11,000 tons were sunk en route.It is believed that if an enemy evacuation of Tunisia were projected thenecessary shipping would be available.20. . Photographic reconnaissance of Spezia on the 14th showed three&quot; Littorio&quot; class battleships, the 8&quot; cruisers Gorizia and Bolzano, the&quot; cruiser Regolo and the old cruiser Taranto. It is believed that one ofthe battleships was hit during the raid of the previous night.

Air reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 12th showed 59 ships, including36 merchant ships totalling 180,000 tons, 10 destroyers, three U-boats and fourtankers.U-boats.22.   Over 100 U-boats are still operating in the Atlantic.The east-bound convoy which was attacked during the week passed through a force of about 12 of these, but losses were kept low by the successful defencemaintained by the escort.It is apparent that a large proportion of the U-boats are dispersed at theextreme range of air sorties from Newfoundland and Ireland (R).Activity in the Caribbean and off S. Africa has practically ceased, butthere are signs of a renewal off the coast of West Africa and also off the U.S. coastbetween New York and C. ITatteras.[25311] B
Protection of Seaborne Trade.23. During the week ending midnight the 11th, 860 ships were convoyed.Of these 149 were in ocean convoys and 711 in British coastal convoys. Seventydestroyers (including 14 U.S. destroyers), 86 sloops, cutters, corvettes and frigates(including one U.S. cutter and two U.S. corvettes), one ocean boarding vessel andtwo armed merchant cruisers, were employed on escort duties.During the same period 92 ships in two ocean convoys arrived in home waters.   Three ships were sunk.24. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy, during the weekending the 10th, totalled 858,000 tons, compared with 845,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 620,100 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 407,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.25. During March ten outward ocean convoys of 210 ships reached their destination without loss, and six such convoys, originally of 268 ships, lost 24before arrival, four of them stragglers. In the West Atlantic and Caribbean130 convoys, comprising 1,698 ships, were escorted without loss, and two suchconvoys lost four ships in all. In addition, five ships were sunk in convoys still at sea at the end of the month.Seven home-bound ocean convoys of 120 ships arrived without loss, and sixsuch convoys, originally of 302 ships, lost 43, ten of which were stragglers.Enemy Attack on Shipping.26. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked and sunkten ships.Three of these were in a homebound and two in a westbound Atlantic convoy.Three were sunk in the Freetown-Dakar area, one off Tobruk, and one oft&apos; theS.E. coast of Australia.A small ship in a coastal convoy was mined and sunk off Worthing. A U.S.ship was damaged by mine off Casablanca.E-boats sank a ship off the Lizard.In the S.W. Pacific one ship was destroyed and three weie damaged by aircraft attacks.The Melbourne Star (12.806 tons), outward-bound from U.K. to Australiawith a cargo of aircraft, was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat on the 2nd whenS.E. of Bermuda.27. Shipping losses of vessels of all tonnages by enemy action during March,as recorded to date, amount to 654.000 tons, representing almost double theaverage for the three previous months. -About 90 per cent, of the losses were dueto U-boats in the Atlantic, whilst aircraft attacks account for the unusually highfigure of 10 per cent.  Losses due to mines or surface craft were negligible.The month was remarkable for the number of heavy attacks launched by -boat packs against the North Atlantic convoys. Indeed, the tonnage lost in convoy. 397,000. was the highest yet recorded, though it may be noted that agreater proportion of the tonnage at risk is now convoyed. In&apos;the Mediterraneanlosses increased from 17,000 to 70,000 tons.Six tankers were sunk during the month, totalling 48,000 tons; three were british, two U.S. and one Norwegian.British Minelaying&quot;28.   During the week mines were laid by surface craft in the Channel andoff the Dutch coast, and by aircraft in the North Sea and the Bay of Biscay.Mines were also laid in the Central Mediterranean by ships and aircraft.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.29. Enemy aircraft were suspected of having laid mines one night in the thames Estuary.  Knock John and Tongue Sand Forts each shot down an aircraft.Mines were destroyed during the week in the Falmouth area, where E-boats were last week suspected, to be mine-laying.A small fishing vessel was sunk outside the swept Channel off Dungeness, andone ship off Worthing.Nine ground mines have been swept during the week in Home Waters. two were destroyed off Haifa. (Palestine) and two off the coast of Morocco.The mine totals are 4,247 ground and 2,409 moored.
Enemy Merchant Shipping.30. Ships engaged in the Bilbao-Bayonne ore trade have been active, thisweek.. In addition to smaller ships previously reported the German s,s. Scharlach-berger (2,844 tons) and s.s. Sperber (889 tons) and the Spanish s.s. Kauldi (3,153tons) left Bilbao on the 8th.The Italian hospital ship Sicilia (9,648 tons) is believed to have been sunkat her berth during an air raid on Naples on the 5th.The German-controlled Vichy s.s. P.L.M. Hi (3,754 tons) arrived at Istanbulon the 9th from Athens and began loading chrome. The Roumanian s.s. AlbaJulia, (5,701 tons) was also loading chrome.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map of Tunisia is included as an inset.)Tunisia.First A rmy.31. Having stabilised our positions in the area of Sedjenane the infantry brigades in the northern sector of Tunisia were rapidly regrouped in readiness for a further attack at divisional strength. This attack began on the 7th and was directed north and north-east between Munchar and Medjez-El-Bab with theobject of straightening out the line of our positions from the coast to Medjez-Ei-Bab. The enemy strongly resisted our advance in this difficult mountainousterrain where it was found necessary to employ mules for the transporting ofsupplies. All the objectives were attained and we have pushed forward between10 and 15 miles. Several enemy tanks were destroyed and 1,000 prisoners captured.Elsewhere on the British-held sector there was extensive patrol activity throughoutthe period.Simultaneously with the operation in the north, another attack was begunbetween Pichon and Fondouk. This was put in on the night of the 7th/8th bya mixed force of British armour and infantry and U.S. infantry. As inthe north, the enemy offered stiff resistance, appreciating that once our armourwas through the Fondouk gap, we were in a position to engage his forces on theirretreat northwards from the Eighth Army. Our infantry crossed the river thatruns between Pichon and Fondouk and secured the important high ground tothe north of the gap. South of the gap. however, progress was slower and theenemy successfully resisted the U.S. infantry&apos;s attempts to dislodge them from their positions. Late on the 9th our tanks attacked, the gap in conjunctionwith motorised infantry and succeeded in clearing a gap through the minefieldsin face of strong opposition. The gap was not forced without loss and 20 of ourtanks were knocked out, but a proportion of these will be repairable. The enemythen fell back on Kairouan, fighting hard, all the way, but he was no longer ableto stem our advance in which the French co-operated on our left flank. On the11th we entered Kairouan, which was left in flames by the enemy. During this operation we destroyed 30 enemy tanks and a quantity of guns, as well as taking2,000 prisoners. Since then the pursuit of- the enemy was carried on by the eighth Army, while the forces employed in the Fonclouk battle were withdrawn to the west and regrouped.&apos; U.S. Sector.32. Further south U.S. troops, after their link-up on the 7th with the eighth Army patrols on the El Guettar-Gabes road, cleared up the battlefieldareas at El Guettar and Maknassy, during the course of which they collected2,000 prisoners and much abandoned equipment. This task done/ they con-centrated in the region of Sbeitla.Eighth Army.33. Once the Eighth Army was clear of the narrow stretch of countrybetween the eastern end of the salt lakes and the coast on the Akarit positionGeneral Montgomery divided his forces into two columns for the pursuit of theenemy northwards. The larger and slower main column advanced up the coastroad towards Sfax, while the other column, consisting of tanks and armoured cars, pushed forward in the open country inland.   Late on the 7th contact was[25311] b 2
made with the enemy rear guards outside Cekhira from which he was forcedto withdraw. Next day our left flank reached the Mezzouna area and on the9th our main column passed through Mahares on their way to Sfax, which was occupied on the following day. &apos; Meanwhile our armoured forces turned easttoward El Djem and La Hensha hard on the heels of the enemy, who avoidedbeing brought to action. On the 11th contact was made with elements of theFirst Army south of Kairouan and on the following day we occupied Sousse.Since then the advance continued, and on the 13th our patrols were in contact with the enemy three miles south of Enfidaville and Djebibina. Since the mainbattle of Mareth the Eighth Army claim to have captured 20,000 prisoners.The Russo-German Campaign.Nor t h e rn Sector.34. Russian attacks have practically ceased on this sector, and they appearto be digging in on the Leningrad Front and south of Lake Ladoga, but a certainamount of small-scale activity on both sides continues.Central Sector.35.   There have been no operations in this sector.Doaetz Sector.36. Renewed German attempts to eliminate Russian bridgeheads on therisrht bank of the Donetz failed. The main effort of the Germans was directed against the Isyum bend and south of Belakleya.Tarria n Bridge he a d.37. There has been no major change in this area, where the Russianattacks in the Krimskaya sector were stopped after only slight progress by stiffGerman resistance and a return of wet weather.The Germans continue to fall back north of the River Kuban and their line is believed to run roughly north and south 20 miles west of Slavyanskayathen eastwards along the south bank of the Kuban to south of Slavyanskaya.Summary.38. Ground conditions resulting from the thaw have restricted activitiesalong the whole front to local operations.Burma.Arakan.39. Readjustments of our forces on the Mayu Peninsula continued.Positions were taken up north of a line approximately running from Gyindaw.on the coast north-eastwards to Hparabyin, east of the Mayu Hills. Gyindaw&apos; isabout 20 miles north of our original positions at Donbaik.Apart from artillery shelling of the coast road, the Japanese have confinedtheir activities over the past few days to patrolling in the hills east of Gyindaw.East of the Mayu River the situation was quiet, with our troops still inTaungmaw.Elsewhere in Burma there is no change.AIR SITUATION.General Review.40. Aircraft of Bomber Command made heavy attacks on Duisburg,Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Spezia.In Tunisia, heavy damage was inflicted on enemy columns in retreat, and on enemy airfields and transport ah*craf t.US. Fortresses (B. 17) effectively bombed Macldalena harbour.In the S.W. Pacific, Allied fighters destroyed a large number of Japanese aircraft.
United Kingdom.41. In daylight a single enemy reconnaissance aircraft flew over SouthWales, and four fighter-bombers, one of which was shot down by A.A. guns,attacked Folkestone. Soon after the raid air-sea rescue operations appeared to bein progress in the Channel, and our fighters shot down four F.W. 190&apos;s and damaged two others.At night 30 enemy aircraft flew inland from the Thames Estuary and bombs were dropped in Essex; three of these aircraft were destroyed and one probably destroyed.Germany and Occupied Territory.Bay.42. The airfields at Tricqueville (Havre), Guipavas (Brest), Carpiquet(Caen) and Fort Rouge (St. Omer) were successfully attacked by escorted Whirl-wind and Typhoon bombers. Bursts were seen on the dispersal areas and onhangars and huts.The railway centres at Abbeville, Caen and Bruges were attacked by escortedVenturas (B. 34) and Whirlwind bombers; hits were made on engine sheds andon railway tracks.Mosquitoes operated successfully against the steel works at Elsdorf, nearAachen, the Stork Diesel Engine Works at Hengelo (Holland) and the railway workshops at Malines. At Hengelo, bombs are believed to have fallen on the machine and turning shops and on a boiler-house; at Malines. bursts were seen onthe repair shop.   Typhoon bombers attacked a factory near Havre.Spitfires, Typhoons and Mustangs (P. 51) made several successful attacks on railway targets in Northern France and the Low Countries. Several locomotiveengines and barges were destroyed or damaged.Night.43. Bomber Command aircraft attacked the following land targets inGerman)&apos;: Aircraft      Attacked TonnageDespatched.

On the first, owing to thickcloud over most of the route and to severe icing conditions, a number of aircraft were compelled to return early.. As it was impossible to identify the town andto see the markers, the crews bombed the estimated position of the town. On thesecond night, the target was again obscured, except for occasional breaks in thecloud, but the markers were dropped on time and could be clearly seen. Reportsvary as to the success of the attack; some crews report a concentration of well-established fires, while others state that the fires were scattered. One largeexplosion occurred soon after the raid began and was followed by several smallerones.   Flak was heavy and accurate on both occasions.Frankfurt was also obscured by clouds. Flares dropped at Oppenheim(20 miles S.W. of Frankfurt) and elsewhere were helpful; the majority of the crews made a timed run from these, bombing the estimated position of the townor the glow of fires reflected on the clouds. Flak was moderately heavy; enemy aircraft were active and several combats ensued, one Ju. 88 being destroyed by aStirling.At Stuttgart, weather conditions were excellent and there was bright moon-light ; visibility was good except in the later stages of the attack when it washampered by smoke from fires. The Pathfinders had no difficulty in identifyingthe town, and the crews of the Main Force report that the marker bombs were concentrated and accurately placed. A large number of fires was started; themain concentration appeared to be around the railway centre, and a further mass of fires stretched from the railway bridge over the River Necker right clown tothe southern part of the town    Towards the end of the attack the whole of the
centre of the town was a blazing mass of fires. A number of large explosionswere observed. Flak was negligible with very few&apos;searchlights operating. Therewere several encounters with enemy aircraft, three of which were destroyed.Hamburg. Bremen and Wilhelmshaven were each attacked by twoMosquitoes.Leaflets were dropped on Lille. Rouen, Orleans and Lyons. Intruder patrolssuccessfully attacked a railway train near Evreux and destroyed two enemy aircraft. Mustangs (P. 51) of Army Co-operation Command destroyed a Do. 217near Paris.Coastal Operations.44. A blockade-runner and four escort vessels were attacked in the Bay of biscay by Wellingtons and torpedo-carrying Hampdens escorted by Beaufighters.The ship, which was later seen in a French port, was hit with a bomb and one ofthe escorts was damaged.Torpedo-carrying Hampdens attacked enemy shipping off the norwegian coast. A 6.000-ton tanker was torpedoed and blew up; the results of attacks on two ships of 5,000 tons and one of 3,000 tons were not observed.Whirlwind bombers attacked a 1,000-ton ship of the dredger type off Brestand set it on fire.Spitfires and Typhoons attacked several small ships off the French and dutch Coasts; a large barge Avas sunk and two tugs, a flakship, a coaster, threeminesweepers and four barges were damaged.From these operations one Hampden, one Spitfire and one Beaufighter failedto return.Bomber Command aircraft, of which 80 were despatched, laid 235 mines in enemy waters.   Three bombers are missing.Northern Italy.45. Of the 211 aircraft despatched to Spezia, 187 attacked the target,dropping 491 tons of bombs. Cloudless conditions with slight ground hazeprevailed over the target, but visibility was*marred by a smoke-screen and laterby smoke from fires. The flares, which were well placed, illuminated the targetbrightly and some crews were able to identify the clocks and other landmarks.Many fires were started, which obtained a firm hold, and the town and dock areasw^ere reported to have been well alight. It is believed that a battleship was hit(see paragraph 20). In the early stages of the attack there was heavy flak, but itdied clown as the attack developed; very few fighters were seen. Fight other aircraft laid 32 mines off Spezia. Four of our aircraft are missing and threecrashed.Mediterranean.Tunisia.46. The full force of our air attack brought to bear on the enemy&apos;s retreatingcolumns on the 7th was continued throughout the following day. Enemy forceswithdrawing from Djebel Chemsi were forced to disperse; heavy damage wasinflicted on M.T. on the Mezzouna-Sfax road and along the coast road whereenemy columns were split up and disorganised; at least 330 vehicles were destroyed or damaged during the day. At Cekhira (28 miles N. of Gabes) Hurri-tankbusters, six of which are missing, attacked a group of 25 tanks preparing fora counter-attack and at least two of them were set on fire. As our land forcesadvanced enemy columns and troop concentrations were harried in the areas tothe north of Kairouan, east of Medjez El Bab and near Enfidaville. At nightlarge-scale attacks were made progressively on Sfax, Sousse and Enfidaville andon M.T., roads and military targets in these areas.On the 11th air reconnaissance disclosed a concentration of 130 enemy aircraft on the airfield at St. Marie du Zit (35 miles S.S.E. of Tunis) and 78 and50 aircraft respectively at Oudna and Menzel Tmime. Thereafter the weight of attack by day and by night on the airfields in the Tunisian bridgehead was very heavy, particularly on St. Marie du Zit, and considerable damage was caused to buildings and aircraft.U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) carried out successful attacks on the docks at Tunisand Bizerta, dropping a total of 117 tons of bombs; one large and one medium-sized ship were hit, bursts were seen on quays and several fires were started.

Enemy opposition was not on a big scale.Forty-three enemy aircraft were shot down and over 50 damaged against our lossSicilian Channel.47. Naval Albacores attacked an enemy convoy N.E. of Sfax and set one ship on fire and another was seen to heel over and probably sank. Another vessel of 2,000 tons was attacked and left sinking south of Marsala. A Wellingtontorpedoed a ship of about 4,000 tons N.W. of Palermo, which blew up and sankin ten minutes.   Mosquitoes destroyed one M.T.B.U.S. Lightnings (P. 38) and U.S. Mitchells (B. 25) successfully interceptedenemy formations over the channel. They shot down 84 aircraft, probably destroyed seven and damaged 12; of those destroyed, 66 were Ju. 52 transport aircraft and two were six-engined Me. 323s; a further four Ju. 52s were shot down by Spitfires.

Auxiliary Vessels and Naval Personnel.The following casualties to naval personnel have been reported : Officers: 8 killed; 4 wounded; 11 missing; 3 prisoners of war,previously reported missing; 1 died of wounds whilst a prisoner of war, previously reported missing.Ratings : 23 killed; 6 wounded; 388 missing.These totals include casualties in H.M.S. Dasher.APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week :  Germany.Essen. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 5th Aprilshows further damage to Krupps as a result of the raid of the 3rd/4th April.Three of the largest buildings, including the shell forgings workshop, have been damaged and seven other shops have been partly destroyed by H.E. or gutted by fire. There are also many incidents of fresh damage in the districts immediatelywest and south-west of Krupps works.Stuttgart. Evidence is accumulating to the effect that the attack on the.11th/ 12th March was far more successful than the photographic reconnaissance,disclosed. It is now known that workmen were ordered to leave their factories to assist in clearance and repair and that craftsmen, the police and, members ofthe armed forces were brought in from other parts of Germany for the likepurpose. A reliable source reports that apart from damage to the tramway depotitself, tram lines were hit in several places and power centres affected. It wasnot until the 20th March that tramways again became fully serviceable.APPENDIX IV.Enemy Merchant Ship Losses as Assessed to March 15, 1943.
Dusseldorf. It is reported that the damage caused to Schiess Defriesmachine tool works at Dusseldorf last year caused several months&apos; delay in thecompletion of a new programme for heavy flak. One of the principal causes wasthe complete destruction of the drawing office, which considerably hampered theproduction of the necessary new machine tools.France.Paris. A final interpretation of photographs confirms the very heavy damage inflicted on the Renault Works by the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 4th April.Almost every major building of the works has sustained damage, which amounts in many cases to the destruction of the greater part. In addition to the Renaultand Salmson Works, the Farman Works lias suffered numerous points of damage, and a large unidentified works, situated near the&apos; Salmson W^orks and said to be engaged on aero-engine construction, has been extensively damaged.More than 40 distinct shops in the Renault Works have been damaged, and include Press shop 3.000 square yards severely damaged.Assembly shops 9.800 square yards wrecked or seriously damaged.Engine testing and finishing shop 3,300 square yards wrecked.Component and tool shop 2.100 square yards collapsed  and hole.900 square yards, in middle of shop.Radiator and axle shop 3,000 square yards wrecked.Pattern shop 2,500 square yards wrecked.Foundry 9,000 square yards wrecked.Sheet metal and radiator shop 22.000 square yards of roof destroyed.Casting foundry 9.000 square yards wrecked.Forges 7,000 square yards wrecked.Engine shop 7.800 square yards wrecked or severely damaged.Non-ferrous metal foundry 5.500 square yards wrecked.Repair shops 6.000 square yards wrecked.Aero-engine assembly shops 4.200 square yards wrecked.Brest. It is now^ learned that during the daylight attack by U.S.A.A.F.aircraft on the 23rd January a bomb pierced the tunnel (which fell in) on theonly line joining the arsenal to the Port de Commerce.Belgium.Liege. Photographs taken on the 4th April show that, as a result of the daylight attack on the 12th March, the major part of the damage is confined to the steel and armament works of S.A. John Cockerill. The forges and boilershops covering an area of over seven acres have been severely damaged and adirect hit has been obtained on the corner of one large building, while others have suffered from blast.Apart from the Cockerili works, two-thirds of a large building of S.A.Angleur-Athus (steel plant) has been gutted, and damage caused to buildings ofS.A. Ougree-Marihaye (blast furnace plant).Holland.Rotterdam. Photographs taken on the 3rd and 4th April show that,following the R.A.F. daylight attacks on the 28th and 29th March and theU.S.A.A.F. daylight attack on the 31st March, damage has been done to shippingas well as to dock buildings. Unemployment/V (250/300ft.)and one small vessel in WiltonsShipyards are awash as-a result of direct hits, and the auxiliary minelayer Cobrain the floating dock in the Wilhelmina Haven is now entirely submerged. A shed60 ft. long in Wiltons Shipyards has been destroyed &apos; and two workshops(375 ft. by 75 ft.) belonging to the Rotterdam Dry Dock Co. have been damaged.Several factory buildings in the vicinity of the. docks have been destroyed or damaged and many hits which were obtained on railway tracks serving the dock area also damaged rolling-stock.
