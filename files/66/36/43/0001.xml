From the very beginning&apos; of the persecution under the National Socialistregime in Germany ot religious, racial and political minorities, the Governmentsof the United States and United Kingdom showed the keenest sympathy for the refugees created in such large numbers by that persecution, in common with several other countries Great Britain and the United States received many thousands of these refugees, and took their share also in any international actionwhich promised to alleviate the sufferings of the exiles. In 1938 an impetus wasgiven to the movement for relief by the initiative of President Roosevelt, inconvening the Inter-governmental Committee at Evian. This committee wasentering upon systematic activity when the war intervened. The refugee problem was not. of course, ended by the war: it was intensified, while, on the other hand,the means of solving it were severely limited. The movement of refugees from europe continued, with notable increases with every fresh German aggression:and despite the demands of the war, wide public interest was shown in the manysuggestions, however impracticable some of them had to be regarded, which weremade to bring more and more refugees away from the dangers of deportationand death. On the 17th December, 1942, a declaration was made by the united nations calling attention to Hitler&apos;s announcement of his intention to exterminatethe Jewish people in Europe, and condemning his policy in the strongest possibleterms. Following this, the British and United States Governments consultedtogether regarding what further could be done. Both Governments agreed that,while each had certain limited individual contributions which it would willinglymake towards a solution, any comprehensive handling of the situation must beon an international basis. As a preliminary to this the United States Govern-inent on the 28th February suggested a review of the situation and a thorough investigation of all the possibilities by representatives designated by the Govern-rnents of the United States and United Kingdom. The basis for the discussionagreed upon was as follows : (a) The refugee problem should not be considered as being confined to persons of any particular race or faith. Nazi measures against minoritieshave caused the flight of persons of various races and faiths, as wellas of other persons because of their political beliefs.(b) Wheresoever practicable,  inter-governmental   collaboration  should  besought in these times of transportation difficulty, shipping shortage,and submarine menace, to the end that arrangements may bedetermined for temporary asylum for refugees as near as possible tothe areas in which these people find themselves at the present timeand from which they may be returned to their homelands with thegreatest expediency on the termination of hostilities.
(c) There should accordingly be considered plans for the maintenance in neutral countries in Europe of those refugees for whose removalprovision may not lie made. Their maintenance in neutral countries may involve the giving of assurances for their support until they canbe repatriated, which support will necessarily come from the united nations augmented by funds from private sources. It may also involve the giving of assurances in all possible cases by their Govern-ments in exile for their prompt return to their native countries uponthe termination of hostilities.(d) The possibilities for the temporary asylum of the refugees, with a viewto their repatriation upon the termination of hostilities, in countries other than neutral, and their dependencies, should be explored,together with the question of the availability of shipping to effecttheir movement from Europe, and the availability of food and accommodation.(?) Examination of the precise method of organising concerted action and providing the necessary executive machinery.2. An invitation to hold the proposed discussions in Bermuda was receivedfrom the Bermuda Government, which also invited the delegations to be theirguests for the duration of the conference. Both invitations were gratefullyaccepted by the United States and the United Kingdom Governments, whichhad. in the meantime, designated as their delegates the following :United States.Dr. Harold W. Dodds.The Hon. Scott W. LucasThe Hon. Sol Bloom.United Kingdom.The Right Hon. R. K. Law.The Right Hon. Osbert Peake.The Right Hon. G. H. Hall.3. The delegates with their advisers and staffs duly assembled and onthe 19th April the conference was opened at a meeting to which prominentcitizens of Bermuda and press correspondents were invited. After a speech ofwelcome by Mr. W. M. Murphy, the Acting-Governor, Dr. Dodds and Air. Lawreplied emphasising the urgency of the problem and giving a warning of theformidable difficulties in the way of a fundamental solution. The delegatesthen went into private session and agreed upon the main topics to which they proposed to devote their attention.   These included : (1) The scope of the problem.(2) Problems of shipping and supply.(3) The Polish and Greek refugees.(4) The refugees in Spain and the prospects of alternative accommodation for them.(5) The Jewish refugees from the Balkans and the difficulties in the wayof removing them to Palestine.(6) The refugee children in France and whether there are any possibilitiesof getting them to the homes offered to them.(7) The refugees who are in or might enter neutral countries (especiallySwitzerland) to remain until the war is over.(8) The future of international refugee organisation and the executive means to be employed.(9) Agreed recommendations to be submitted to United States and UnitedKingdom Governments.4. Senator Lucas, of the United States Delegation, was prevented by illnessfrom attending the first meeting but joined the conference on the 24th April.Afterwards, all the regular meetings, twelve in number, were attended by all sixdelegates and there were in addition numerous less formal exchanges of views.5. All of the meetings, except the first, were held in private and at the endof the conference it was agreed that none of the delegates, and neither of their governments would disclose any of the proceedings of the conference or its recommendations except by mutual agreement sought through the diplomaticchannel.6.   The delegates expressed the hope that it might very soon be possible fortheir Governments to make certain items public at intervals, and it was recognised[25402] b 2
that the recommendations regarding the Inter-governmental Committee whenpassed on to a number of foreign Governments would have to be disclosed. Butboth delegations agreed that such publications would only be made by mutual agreement and should so far as possible be simultaneous.7. The final communique issued to the press is given as Annex A to thisreport.I. - The Scope of the Problem.8. The conference opened its work by defining the scope of the problem.It was at once faced with the necessity for considering proposals put forward by certain Jewish and other organisations interested in the refugee problem.These proposals were included in various memoranda submitted to the conference.If adopted they would have put the problem on an entirely different basis fromthat on which it had hitherto been considered by the Governments concerned. Theprincipal proposals were in effect (1) That an approach should be made to Hitler to release Jews in Germanyand German-occupied countries.(2) That the Jews in Germany or German-occupied countries should be released in exchange for German internees or prisoners of war heldby the United Nations.(3) That the United Nations should send food through the blockade to feedJews in Europe.9. It was recognised that the first proposal envisaged negotiations withHitler. Both delegations believed that such negotiations would be directlycontrary to the settled policies of the two Governments concerned and would in jurethe war effort of the United Nations. Apart from the fact that the proposal inequity would have to be extended to all of Hitler&apos;s victims who might wish toleave, it was strongly felt that to make any general approach to the GermanGovernment on this point would entangle the United Nations in commitments which could only be fulfilled, if at all, at the expense of the war effort.Nevertheless, it was. felt that the question might be borne in mind in caseconditions altered at a later date, when it will be for the Executive Committee ofthe Inter-governmental Committee to consider possible action.10. The second proposal, for an exchange of Jews against internees orprisoners of war, was agreed to be impossible. No suitable internees wereavailable in either country, and the exchange of prisoners of war for civilianscould not be contemplated.11. The third suggestion, for the supply of food, raised questions of blockade policy, which were considered to be outside the terms of reference ofthe conference. But it was agreed that to supply food to Jews in Europe wouldbe impossible except as part of a general proposal to feed all the oppressednationalities under Nazi control.II. The Shipping Factor.12. Having duly considered and disposed of the suggestions referred to inthe preceding section, the conference then turned to the shipping situation, which inevitably imposed limitations on any action it might recommend;. Here it soonbecame apparent that no shipping from United Nations sources could be madeavailable for the transport of refugees from Europe. All such shipping was urgently required for the prosecution of the war. Nor did it seem possible in existing war conditions to adopt the proposal to place refugees on returning trooptransports. The assembly of refugees at ports where troops were landed would interfere with military movements and presented insurmountable securitydifficulties; to divert the transports to other ports would cause delay in the movements of the armed forces of the United Nations and of essential war supplies. Thus the only hope at present of obtaining transportation for the refugees to overseas destinations was neutral shipping. The conferencerecognised that there were certain ships on neutral register which the Govern-ments concerned would be unwilling to place at the disposal of the United Nations
for their war effort, which, however, they might consent to make available foruse in the relief of refugees. It would probably be essential for safe conduct tobe obtained. The conference heard detailed testimony regarding the neutral shipsavailable, both the passenger ships for the transport of refugees and the cargo ships which would subsequently be needed to bring supplies to them in their placeof refuge. The conference agreed that detailed decisions and arrangements onthis point should normally be left to the Inter-governmental Committee. Pending-revision of the committee&apos;s mandate, however, the conference suggested that thetwo Governments concerned should themselves, in consultation, investigate thepossibilities of securing neutral ships.III. Categories of Refugees.13. The conference then discussed the refugees on whose behalf positive action had been or could be taken.A. Polish Refugees.14. Some 40,000 Polish civilians of all ages and both sexes arrived in Persiabetween April and July 1942. Their presence there was a hindrance to the war effort; it complicated the already difficult supply problem in Persia, an area of vital importance to the war effort and one of the main supply routes to the soviet union. Arrangements had been made to move 21,000 of these Polish refugees toBritish Colonies in East Africa and about half of them had already arrived, but.owing to food shortage in that area, the transfer of the rest had had to be slowedclown, but would be resumed when the situation improved. The American red cross had sent generous supplies to East Africa to assist. About 1,700 Jewishchildren among the Polish refugees had been or would be sent to Palestine. india was taking 5,000 Polish refugees. There remained 12,300, for some of whomasylum in Mexico, Southern Rhodesia and South Africa had been offered. the mexican Governments generous offer of refuge had so far remained without result owing to lack of shipping. The East African Colonies might be able totake more Polish refugees if they could be relieved of some or all of the 80,000Italian prisoners of war now there, and if, in addition, the food situation couldbe restored. The United States Government had agreed to take a large numberof the prisoners of war, but here, again, shipping difficulties prevented this offerfrom being implemented. The Conference learned with satisfaction that theSouth African Government had offered as a contribution to a solution of thedifficulty to receive about 15,000 more prisoners from East Africa. The conference agreed that the question of finding countries of asylum for such Polish refugeesas remained in Persia should be referred to the Inter-governmental Committee.B. Greek Refugees.15. Some 16,500 Greeks were reported to have escaped from the Greekmainland and islands after the German occupation in 1941. Turkey could not maintain those who tied to that country and 4,650 went to Cyprus, 3,000 to theBelgian Congo, 2,000 to Syria and 200 to Palestine. Some 5,000 were in campsin Egypt, and Ethiopia had agreed to accommodate 1,000. It is desirable, ifpossible, to evacuate some, if not all. of the Greek refugees from Cyprus in orderto free space in the island for further arrivals. The British Delegation agreedto recommend reconsideration of the United States Delegation^ suggestion toaccept such refugees in Cyrenaica. This had earlier been informally proposed tothe British military authorities, who had advanced certain objections.C. Refugees in Spain.16. It was the opinion of the delegates that refugees in Spain constituteone of the most important of the problems presented for the consideration of theconference. With a full realisation of the need for the immediate relief forrefugees in Spain, the delegates explored and examined all possible measures attheir command which would in any way offer a solution to the problem. It was recognised that, the moment refugees from Spain could be transferred to someother country, the oppressed peoples now living in the enemy-occupieci countries would make extraordinary efforts to find their wray to Spain. The delegatespointed out that, if Spain cannot be relieved immediately of her present burden,it, is not inconceivable that her frontiers will be closed, thereby cutting off the
major channel of escape of refugees from Axis-dominated countries. the delegates agreed that, if Spain took such steps, it would destroy the hopes of thousands of unfortunate people in occupied Europe.17. The refugees in Spain were considered under three headings : Firstly,there were the French, believed to number about 14,000. For these a country ofdestination existed in North Africa, and the principal problem was to obtain permission for them to leave. This was understood to be the subject of negotia-tions between the Spanish Government and the British, American and french north African authorities, and the conference recommended continued action bythe United States and United Kingdom Governments to secure this. In so far as these efforts were unsuccessful, the French refugees in Spain would constitute a problem for eventual action by the Inter-governmental Committee.IS. Secondly, there were the Allied nationals wdio had been accepted for service in the armed forces of their respective countries. These numbered about800. mainly Poles, and would be taken to the United Kingdom, and a smaller number for North Africa as soon as permission for them to depart had beenreceived. They were thus in a situation analogous to that of the French refugees,and the conference recommended similar action in their case.19. Finally, there were the remaining 6,000 to 8,000 refugees, largely,though not exclusively, Jews from Central Europe. Two thousand or less of these had reached Spain prior to 1942 and had been unable to proceed owing to lackof visas; these were a normal cross section as regards age and sex. The rest were mainly young men who had crossed the Spanish frontier since the completeGerman occupation of France. All the possible destinations for this group werereviewed.20. They were, briefly, (a) the admission of that part of the group inquestion into the United States which will be able to satisfy statutory and security requirements; (b) certificates for admission of others to Palestine were already available, and the work of selection would be undertaken by a representative ofthe Jewish Agency, whose admission for this purpose to Spain would, if possible,be facilitated by the British Government, failing which, it was suggested by theUnited States delegation, the representative in Spain of the American JointJewish Distribution Board might undertake the task; (c) removal to temporaryresidence in North Africa, which the United States delegation agreed to submit to the United States Government, with the reservation that military considera-tions might be an insuperable objection during active operations; (d) a limitedgroup to be recommended for admission to Jamaica; (e) further limitedadmissions to the United Kingdom, where temporary detention on security grounds would in most cases be necessary; (/) approaches to Canada, to thePortuguese Government over the use of Angola, and to Latin American countries.It was agreed that action under (/) should be recommended to be taken by theInter-governmental Committee, with the diplomatic support of the United Statesand United Kingdom Governments. The other possibilities would be forthwithcommended for investigation by these two Governments, as part of a united plan for solving the Spanish problem as a whole; the most formidable obstacle, totalinability to divert United Nations shipping from immediate war purposes, would,it was hoped, be overcome by the chartering of neutral and, in particular,Portuguese, shipping.D. Refugees from Eastern Europe.21. The conference was informed that the British authorities were making arrangements for the reception in Palestine of a considerable number of jewish refugees, mostly children and principally from the Balkans and Eastern Europe;The number of Jews who could be admitted to Palestine wa.s established in theBritish Governments White Paper of 1939. Apart from the question oftransport, arrangements had been completed for the immediate admission of4,000 children and 500 adults from Bulgaria. As a solution to the transportproblem the United Kingdom Government were trying to obtain the use of twoRoumanian liners, and the American delegates, at the request of their Britishcolleagues, agreed to refer to the United States Government the possibility ofsharing the cost of the charter. The assent of the United States Government tothis proposal was in due course received.
22. The Palestine authorities were prepared to admit immediately, i.e., bythe end of June 1943, a further 12,500 Jews, of whom about 85 per cent, wouldbe children, all from enemy or enemy-occupied territory; this would leave afurther 16,500 to be admitted before the end of the White Paper period.Transport difficulties, however, were formidable and the questions of accom-niodation and sustenance in Palestine had necessarily to be taken intoconsicleraion.E. Refugee Children in France.23. The plight of refugee children in France has been of deep concern to theGovernments of the United States and the United Kingdom. Practicablemeasures were undertaken by the two Governments, in common with, otherGovernments, for the evacuation of these children, many of whose parents wereforcibly returned to Germany for involuntary servitude. The measures adoptedincluded efforts to facilitate the issuance of French exit permits as well as the granting of permission for the admission of the children into the United Statesand into the United Kingdom. These measures, if it had been possible to carrythem out, would have resulted in the rescue of several thousand children.Unfortunately, before they could be realised the whole of France v/as overrun.The problem now resolves itself into a question of finding means for the evacuation of those children who remain in France to the places of refuge which areavailable., The conference explored the manifold problems relating to thesechildren and urgently recommended the continuance of efforts in their behalfthrough the intermediary of neutral Governments and the Inter-governmental committee.F. Refugees in Neutral Countries.24. The conference recognised that certain neutral countries of Europe hadgenerously provided asylum and support for the refugees who both before and during the war had made their way into their territories. Switzerland, inparticular, owing to her geographical position, had found herself with a large additional alien population on her hands, and had maintained this population inspite of her difficult supply situation. Though this additional burden was nolight one, the aspect of the question which was understood, to be of most concern to neutral Governments in a similar situation was the future of the refugees afterthe war. If they could be assured that they would eventually be relieved of this burden by the return of the refugees to their homes, it would be a great encourage-ment to them. The Polish Government had recently stated publicly its intentionof facilitating the return of all its nationals to Poland after the war: it wouldbe desirable that all the other European Allies should do likewise. This wouldnot dispose of the question of the persons from enemy territories, and it wouldbe necessary to announce the intention of creating conditions in such territories which would enable the refugees to return to them. The conference drew up adraft declaration to cover both these points, the text of which is annexed to thisreport, and. submitted it in advance of the conclusion of its discussions to theUnited States and United Kingdom Governments, with the recommendation thatits adoption be urged on the Governments concerned.25. The conference also recommended that the Inter-governmental committee should consider the provision of food and finance for refugees in neutral countries.G. Refugees of Spanish Nationality.26. The conference considered the question of the Spanish refugees inFrance and French North Africa, regarding whom representations had beenreceived It was recognised that the situation of the Spanish Republicans inGerman-occupied France was one of the most unhappy elements in the wholerefugee problem, but that no action of any kind was possible to relieve it. Theposition of the Spanish refugees in North Africa was being investigated by thelocal authorities, and no action by the conference appeared necessary.
IV. Countries of Refuge.A. The United States of America.27. Since the advent of the Nazi regime in 1933 the United States has issued approximately 547,000 visas to aliens who were natives or nationals of countries now dominated by that regime.28. More than 300,000 immigrants have been admitted into the UnitedStates since 1938, of whom about 195,000 came from Europe. The number of approved cases under the war-time visa procedure has exceeded the number of aliens who have been able to reach the United States. The consideration of individual cases under this procedure is practically current. Children who are obviously too young to have an adverse record abroad or to offer any threat to internal security have from time to time been exempted from full compliance with the war-time visa procedure. Within the framework of its laws and regula-tions the United States has given, and will continue to give, the most expeditiousconsideration practicable to the cases of aliens who are seeking refuge fromoppression and a new life in America.29. The immigration laws of the United States are enacted by the congress and can be changed only through congressional action. There have been nofurther numerical restrictions imposed upon the immigration of aliens into theUnited States since the Evian-London Conference. Except for the war-timesecurity procedure in examining aliens seeking to enter the United States, therehave been no special restrictions of any kind imposed upon immigration into theUnited States since the beginning of the war in Europe.30. The immigration policy of the United States is founded upon the lawsenacted by Congress and is reflected in regulations promulgated by the ExecutiveBranch of the Government in pursuance of the laws. The principle embodied in the laws enacted by the United States to control immigration is that all aliensshould be permitted to enter the country, after compliance with certain formalrequirements, unless there should be some provision in the law or regulations which would preclude their entry. This principle is to be distinguished fromone which would prohibit the entry of all aliens unless in each individual case theparticular person should come up to a fixed standard of selective desirability.31. The war-time immigration proceduie of the United States envisages thepossibility that, since the doors are left open to enemy nationals, subversive agents and saboteurs may attempt to enter in the guise of refugees from enemy countries.It is based upon the policy that, while the gates have not been closed to worthyimmigrants in time of war. dangerous or questionable, aliens should be excluded.32. Group immigration is not authorised under the laAvs of the UnitedStates. Each individual alien&apos;s case must be decided upon its own merits.Subject to such security measures as may be deemed appropriate, however, theUnited States is prepared to accept all qualified aliens, including refugees, up tothe limits of the quotas established under the law.B. The United Kingdom.33. Since the establishment of the Nazi regime visas for United kingdom have been granted in considerable numbers for temporary residence, and ifthe alien has not shown himself to be undesirable, the period for which he hasbeen permitted to reside has been extended from time to time. It has been madea condition in regard to practically all the refugees who arrived during the period1933 to 1939 that they should proceed to countries of ultimate settlement as soonas they could obtain entry. After the seizure of Austria in March 1938 the rateof flow of refugees noticeably increased. It was accelerated after the Munichcrisis of 1938 and further accelerated when Czechoslovakia was absorbed into germany in March 1939. In all. 55,000 persons of German or Austriannationality, clearly recognisable as refugees, were admitted prior to the war, aswell as 10,000 Czechoslovak nationals. The Germans and Austrians brought withthem children in numbers which cannot be accurately stated, and over and abovethese two classes a further 13.000 children from Greater Germany were brought in unaccompanied by parents. A small number of these 78,000 persons have left for countries of ultimate destination.   On the outbreak of war all outstanding
visas were cancelled and only in exceptional circumstances, such as a wife joininga husband, or children joining their parents, were&apos; further refugees of enemynationality admitted. The fall of France in June 1940 brought a further floodof refugees, for the most part without visas, to British shores. In the three years since May 1940 a further 63,000 refugees of many nationalities, other than british, have been admitted. These consist in large part of persons arriving invarious ways from the continent.and of men desiring to join one of the allied forces in Great Britain. Over and above these persons, Great Britain has received30,000 British refugees from the Channel Islands and 14,000 from Gibraltar. Thepresent practice in relation to the grant of visas is that the grant should be shown to be in the national interest. Under this heading persons volunteering for oneof the Allied forces, and^feheir wives and children, qualify for visas.34. In August 1940/His Majesty&apos;s Government expressed their willingness to grant visas to refrrgee children in Vichy France who had a near relative,i.e:, parent, uncle, aunt or grandparent, already in the United Kingdom. Underthis procedure between 100 and 200 visas were authorised, but none of them couldbe utilised owing to the difficulty of. obtaining exit permits and the completeoccupation of France. This arrangement was subsequently extended to similarclasses of children in Spain, Portugal and Sweden.35. The present rate of refugee immigration into the United Kingdom both authorised and unauthorised is approximately 800 persons per month, or at the rate of 10,000 persons per annum. The British authorities, after full consideration of the present problems of accommodation in the United Kingdom,made more difficult as it is by the large number of houses which have been damaged in air raids, by the necessity of importing food, by the large number of UnitedStates and other Allied forces stationed in the United Kingdom and by theproblem of transport by sea, have not hitherto been prepared to relax the present practice in regard to visas. To grant visas more freely would raise false hopesowing to transport difficulties, and would, even if these difficulties couldconceivably be overcome, result in a further large number of persons being addedto the population of an already overcrowded island. Persons who are willing and able to render useful help to the war effort experience little difficulty in securingvisas. Beyond this the United Kingdom is prepared, in association with other nations, to assume a further responsibility for giving temporary refuge to persons whose numbers under war conditions must necessarily be limited and who cannotconform to the foregoing conditions.C. Palestine.36. More than 300,000 Jewish immigrants have entered Palestine since theestablishment of the British Mandate in 1919.37. Included in this total are those 38,000 who entered the country fromthe 1st April, 1939, to the 30th September, 1942. About 3,000 or a little morehave entered it since that date. This leaves a figure of about 34,000 jewish immigrants whose entry is permissible before the expiry of the White Paperquotas at the end of March 1944. The question of these further admissions is dealt with in chapter III, D, of this report. In addition to the above permanentimmigrants, Palestine has received about 4,000 temporary refugees from central europe, of whom 40 per cent, are Jews. Difficulties of supply render it imprac-ticable for Palestine to accept any further temporary refugees in addition tothe permanent settlers in contemplation.D. Other British Territories.38. The substantial contributions to the solution of the European refugeeproblem made by the United Kingdom, Palestine, East Africa, Cyprus and India,have been dealt with in other sections of this report. Other parts of the BritishCommonwealth have made their several contributions, and further possibilities in the Colonies in the Caribbean area, and more particularly in British Honduras,in British Guiana and in Mauritius were examined.39.   In the Colonies in the Caribbean area in general there would be the gravest difficulties in receiving refugees owing to the acute supply position,especially in regard to food, fuel and accommodation.   It is already straining to[25402] c
the utmost the shipping reserves of the United Nations to supply the bare needsof the existing population. It has to be remembered that European populationsin these territories require food-stuffs which are unobtainable in tropicalcountries and which would have to be imported.40. British Honduras is agriculturally an extremely difficult country. Asfar as temporary residence is concerned, there is no accommodation, and thereare neither suitable sites, building material nor adequate skilled labour availablefor the construction of large-scale camps. Owing to its climatic conditionsBritish Honduras offers no prospects to Europeans not accustomed to manual labour in the tropics.41. In British Guiana the possibilities for settlement have previously been investigated. It was found that the coastal area is climatically quite unsuitedfor the purpose. The highlands of the interior, which afford the only possiblearea for the settlement of Europeans, are at present very difficult of access. Theconstruction of the internal communications required could not. be undertakenduring the war. and would, in any case, need a long period for their completion.42. In Mauritius about 1,600 Jewish refugees have already been temporarilyaccommodated. The possibility of accepting a number&apos; of Greek refugees, subjectto certain conditions, has been considered by the local authorities. The food situation in Mauritius, however, has recently become acute, and this has madethe reception in the Colony of further refugees impossible in &quot;presentcircumstances.E. Other Countries.43. The two delegations considered the possibilities of Madagascar and agreed to recommend that an approach should be made to the French national committee in order&apos; to secure their favourable consideration of the proposal to admit refugees to that territory.44. The conference examined the possibilities of the reception of refugeesin other territories in Latin America, the British Dominions and Africa. Butit was agreed that the problems raised could not usefully be discussed further ata meeting confined to representatives of the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates of America and must be referred to the Inter-governmental Committee.On the subject of the refugee settlement in Santo Domingo, note was taken of thereport that the experiment had not fulfilled expectations.V. Recommendations Arising out of the Proposed Utilisation of theInter-governmental Committee in Conjunction with the Solution ofthe Problems Presented by the Refugees.45. The American and United Kingdom delegates to the conference heldat Bermuda have agreed to the submission to their respective Governments ofthe following recommendations. These recommendations concern the contributionto be made by the Inter-governmental Committee towards the solution of the pressing problems created by the existence of large numbers of refugees resultingfrom the present war. It is recognised by both delegations that this problem asit is now constituted can only be solved by the community of civilised nations.The problem is of such magnitude as to be incapable of solution by the UnitedStates and Great Britain alone.46. Various means of obtaining concerted action between the nationsinterested in this problem have been considered, and it is the unanimousconviction of the delegates to this conference that the problem should be entrusted to the Inter-governmental Committee. The future welfare of these refugees willbe largely dependent upon the successful prosecution of the duties which maybe entrusted to the committee. Special care, therefore, must be taken to defineaccurately the scope of these duties and to extend wherever necessary the powersand responsibilities of the committee.47. The Bermuda Conference therefore presents four positive recommenda-tions to the two Governments here represented for consideration by the ExecutiveCommittee of the Inter-governmental Committee.   These proposals involve new
duties for the Inter-governmental Committee, a widening of its field of activity and a strengthening of its organisation. They envisage the necessity for negotiations with Allied and neutral Governments, but not, of course, with enemyGovernments. These negotiations will include, for example, approaches in regardto the chartering of neutral shipping, the procurement of places of refuge andin some cases appeal to neutral Governments for the furtherance of humanitarianproposals. The area of primary interest to the work of the Inter-governmental committee should be confined to those countries and people from which refugeescome as a result of the war in Europe or in which they may find refuge.48. The mandate of the Inter-governmental Committee, which was adequateat the time it was adopted at the Evian Conference, is now unsuited to theemergency created by the war. The limitations imposed upon the work of thecommittee by this mandate are evident. Its scope is now restricted to refugees from Germany, Austria and the Sudetenland. It acts under the stipulation thatthe maintenance and transport of refugees is not to be at the cost of member governments. It will be necessary, therefore, for the Inter-governmental committee to receive and disburse funds both public and private. In addition,the Inter-governmental Committee as it now exists is free under its mandate tonegotiate with the German Government on refugee matters. The committeesuffers from a further disability in that its membership does not include some ofthe United Nations and neutrals whose assistance is of particular value.49. It is obvious that these conditions must be altered. It is of the utmost importance that the scope of the activities of the Inter-governmental Committeebe broadened so as to permit its efficient and energetic operation.50. The following measures are proposed by the delegates to the RefugeeConference at Bermuda :  (a) The Committee should be invited to revise its mandate. In order to effect this purpose it is suggested that the mandate should read as follows : &quot;The Executive Committee of the Inter-governmental Committee ishereby empowered by the member States to undertake negotiations with neutral or Allied States or organisations and to take such steps as may benecessary to preserve, maintain and transport those persons displaced fromtheir homes by their efforts to escape from areas where their lives and libertyare in danger on account of their race, religion or their political beliefs. Theoperation of the committee shall extend to all countries from whichrefugees come as a result of the war in Europe or in which they may-find refuge. The Executive Committee shall be empowered to receive anddisburse for the purposes enumerated above, funds both public and private.&quot;(b) It is further recommended by the delegates to the conference at Bermudathat the membership of the Inter-governmental Committee be broadened.Specifically, invitations might be extended to the U.S.S.R., Poland, Greece and yugoslavia, and possibly to other countries. It is assumed that France&apos;s placeon the Executive Committee must, unfortunately, for obvious reasons, beconsidered vacant for the present. However, the interests of the citizens ofFrance will be protected by the committee with the utmost care and the hopethat France may soon be able to take her place on the committee will be constantlyborne in mind.(c) It is recommended that provision be made for the procurement of fundsadequate for the Avork of the committee. The member States should be urged tomake material contributions toward the work of the committee. The delegates to the Bermuda Conference believe that it would be preferable to revive thepractice of pro rata contributions on the Geneva basis. However, if this should prove impracticable they would regard as reasonable the alternative of voluntary contributions from member Governments. In addition, the delegates assume that considerable funds will be available from private sources,(d) The administrative organisation of the committee is not conducive toefficient operation. Considerable increase in the staff of the Executive Committeewill be essential to the proper conduct of the important duties which the committee must undertake. The delegates believe that these additions to personnel may bemade by the Executive Committee without special authorisation from the member states and that they can be effected from time to time as the occasion demands.Flowever, a specific recommendation is made for the creation within the ExecutiveCommittee of a Management Committee composed of a salaried chairman,director and secretary.[25402] d
51. It is obvious that the pressure of events will not permit long delay inthe completion of the measures proposed above. If the labours of the Conferenceon Refugees in Bermuda are not to be in vain, it is essential that early and decisiveaction be taken upon the proposals which are to be made. No lack of effort or interest must be permitted to stand in the way of the efficient prosecution of thevarious measures planned for the alleviation of the unhappy plight of the refugees. The delegates to the Conference at Bermuda therefore propose thattheir Governments take immediate steps to implement the recommendationsrelating to the Inter-governmental Committee.VI.--Communications Received.52.

The United States and United Kingdom delegates examined the refugeeproblem in all its aspects, including the position of those potential refugees whoare still in the grip of the Axis Powers without any immediate prospect ofescape. Nothing was excluded from their analysis and everything that held out any possibility, however remote, of a solution of the problem was carefullyinvestigated and thoroughly discussed. From the outset it was realised that any recommendation that the delegates could make to their Governments must passtwo tests : Would any recommendation submitted interfere with or delay the war effort of the United Nations, and was the recommendation capable of accomplish-ment under war conditions? The delegates at Bermuda felt bound to rejectcertain proposals which were not capable of meeting these tests.55. The delegates were able to agree on a number of concrete recommenda-tions which they are jointly submitting to their Governments and which, it is felt,will pass the tests set forth above and will lead to the relief of a substantial number of refugees of all races and nationalities. Since the recommendationsnecessarily concern Governments other than those represented at the BermudaConference and involve military considerations, they must remain confidential.It may be said, however, that in the course of discussion the refugee problem wasbroken down into its main elements. Questions of shipping, food and supplywere fully investigated.56. The delegates also agreed on recommendations regarding the form of inter-governmental organisation which was best fitted, in their opinion, to handle the problem in the future.   This organisation would have to be flexible
enough to permit it to consider without prejudice any new factors that might come to its attention.57. In each of these fields the delegates were able to submit agreed proposalsfor consideration of their respective Governments.Annex B.Draft Declaration.58. The Belgian. Czechoslovak, Greek, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norwegian,Polish. Soviet, United Kingdom, United States and Yugoslav Governmentsrecognise with gratitude the humanitarian contributions made towards thesolution of the refugee problem by those neutral States which accept and preservethose people fortunate enough to escape across their holders from areas where their lives and liberty are in danger on account of their race, religion or their political beliefs. They understand that this action often increases the difficultiesalready caused by the war within these States. These burdens may, of course, beborne under emergency conditions and for limited periods. It cannot be expectedthat these count ides, some of which are already overcrowded, should maintainthese people for an indefinite period.59. The above-mentioned Governments hereby declare that they will, at thetermination of this war. admit to their territories all of their nationals who mayhave been displaced by the war into other countries. They further declare thatit is a part of the settled policy of their Governments to ensure such conditionsin the territories at present subject to disturbances caused by the war as willenable all such persons, of whatever nationality, to return to their homes at theend of the war.
