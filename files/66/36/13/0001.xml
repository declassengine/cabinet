This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the War Cabinet, April, 1943SECRETW.P. (43) 16318/// April, 1943.AIR MAILS FOR H.M. FORCES OVERSEASMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI. I invite the attention of the War Cabinet to the following summary of the currentarrangements for air mail services to troops overseas, a subject which has been the cause ofsome criticism and discontent both among the troops and among the general public, andwhich has recently been under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff and Overseas MailCommittees.2. Types of Air Mail.There are three principal kinds of air correspondence to and from the troops, namely: (a) Airgraphs. When aircraft are available these are sent direct to or via the middle east by the Mediterranean route. They can now, however, be sent via north africa and Tripoli, where the appropriate machinery has been set up and is nowready to function.   Total load 350 lbs. per week, or over a million airgraphs.(&amp;) Air letters and air letter-cards. Outwards there are the 6d. air letters and home-wards the 3d. air letter cards. Both types are sealed and liable to be seen only by the censors, but as they are written on a special form, no enclosures are permitted. The total estimated load of these outwards is 9,000 lbs. or over one and a half million air letters weekly. The lift via North Africa is insufficient to carry this load at present, but it should prove sufficient for the requirementsof the British North African Force, the Eighth Army and the forces in theMiddle East, and the balance can be carried by the route via West Africa.(c) Air mail letters. These are sealed and the weight within limits determines the cost,the minimum charge being is. 3d. These are routed at present partly by air andpartly by sea. This had given rise to general and justifiable complaints in thepast on account of the delay in delivery. On occasions, in fact, it has been necessary to route them by sea throughout, and the public do not feel they are getting a square deal, considering the high fee charged. This is the only form ofair letter in which enclosures are permitted, and for this reason there is a demandfor this service. Its total estimated volume is 3,000 lbs. or 150,000 lettersweekly.I was inclined to suggest that the air mail letter service should be discontinued. I understand, however, that both the Secretary of State for air and the Postmaster General favour its retention, and see a reasonable prospectof improving the service materially in the near future. I do not, therefore,propose its discontinuance.Schedules at Appendices &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; show the estimated total present requirements in detail, both outwards and homewards.3. Air Capacity available.To ensure an efficient air service to the different theatres there must be allottedsufficient air capacity when and where it is required. Regularity of flights is essential, andthis is particularly so in the case of airgraphs, so as to avoid congestion at the processingmachines in the overseas theatres.Copy N(Q3jWAR CABINET
The air capacity at present allotted for troops&apos; air mails is as follows : (a) 6,000 lbs. weekly via West Africa for H.M. Forces in the Middle East and beyondwas authorized by the War Cabinet (W.M. (42) 138th Conclusions, item 3).(b) 6,000 lbs. weekly via North Africa for H.M. Forces in North Africa and the eighth army, was agreed at the Overseas-Mail Committee (O.M. (43) 1st Meeting).It will be seen, therefore, that a total capacity of 12,000 lbs. a week should now beavailable for the carriage of troops&apos; air mail on these two main routes.It is most desirable that the mails should be allocated to either route according to therequirements of the moment, so as to provide flexibility and the best possible service fromthe postal point of view. This total of 12,000 lbs. would then cover all airgraph films andair letters to and from I-I.M. Forces in North Africa, Tripolitania, Middle Fast, Persia/Iraq,India, Ceylon, East Africa, South Africa and West Africa.This would entail the extension of the North Africa route, which at present stops atTripoli, as far as Cairo, either in the same plane or by adequate transhipment arrangements at Tripoli. I understand that such an extension is, in fact, contemplated and, if practical considerations permit, will be introduced in the near future.The existing air mail service for H.M: Forces in Malta (approximately 600 lbs. weekly)and Gibraltar (approximately 1,200 lbs. weekly) should not be interfered with. This service is quite separate from the above.4. If the allotment of 6,000 lbs. to North Africa serves also the Middle East area, theposition will be This balance of 2,650 lbs. just fails to cover the present is. 3d. air mail letter require-ments (3,000 lbs.), but the deficiency is likely to increase.5. Priority of Allotment.Air mail has at present no overriding first priority, even up to the 12,000 lbs. allotment,over important passengers and freight. If regularity is to be assured such priority isessential.6. Machinery for Operating the Service.Now that an Air Transport Command is established, the Air Ministry will, I am sure,provide the necessary machineiy for ensuring that the scheme envisaged will run smoothly.The morale of the troops depends to a very great extent on a quick and efficient mailservice, and no stone should be left unturned to achieve this. It has recently been agreedthat there should be set up a &quot;working&quot; Mails Committee, under the Overseas MailsCommittee, to keep under review all questions of overseas mails, including air mail. &apos; Onthis Committee the General Post Office and the Service Departments would be represented,other Departments being co-opted as necessary ; and its formation should help to straightenout difficulties and delays in mail services for the troops.7. Telegraphic Services.I have not in this paper dealt with the question of telegraphic services to and from H.M.Forces overseas, as this matter is now under examination by a special Sub-Committee of theImperial Communications Committee ; but undoubtedly some improvement in this service isan urgent matter.8. Conclusion.To sum up, I consider that in order to maintain an efficient and satisfactory air mailservice to and from H.M. Forces overseas, there should be allotted an overriding first priority for aircraft to carry troops&apos; mail regularly, when and where required, up to the agreed allotmentof 12,000 lbs. weekly in each direction, including an extension of the North Africa service to cairo so as to give flexibility.total allotment12,000 lbs.9,350 lbs.(see paragraph 2 above)Balance.2,650 lbs.P.
