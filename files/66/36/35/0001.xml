THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1943.SECRET. 7 Copy No.. 2W.P. (43) 185April 30. 1943.WAR CABINET.INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their Meeting on the 8th April* the War Cabinet asked that theCommittee appointed to consider certain questions relating to the scheme for aCommercial Union should also consider the plan for the international regulationof primary products outlined in the Report attached to the Memorandum by theMinister without Portfolio (W.P. (43) 97). The Committee have now considered this plan and have invited me to report their views as follows to the War Cabinet.2. We are in general satisfied that some form of international regulationis necessary in order to avoid, the violent price fluctuations which were a feature ofthe inter-war period; and we believe that the plan outlined in W.P. (43) 97 is.broadly speaking, the best that can be devised for this purpose.3. We attach special importance to the proposals in regard to buffer stocks which are set out in paragraph 12 of the Report, and regard these proposals asthe essence of the plan. We.recognise that in the case of certain commoditiesthese proposals may not in themselves be sufficient and that in certain circum-stances they may have to be supplemented by schemes for the international regulation of exports; and we agree that the plan for the international regulationof primary products should leave room for such schemes subject to the necessarysafeguards to ensure that they are not operated in the sole interest of producers.Our only fear is that, if the plan is put forward in its present form, an attemptmay be made by producer interests to concentrate attention on the passagesdealing with these restriction schemes at the expense of those which outline theproposals with regard to buffer stocks.4. In its present form the scheme set out in W.P. (43) 97 represents a balanced plan which has taken this shape only after consultation with therepresentatives of the Dominion Governments and of the Government of India.In accordance with W.M. (43) 50th Conclusions, Minute 2 (i) it has, moreover,already been communicated to Dominion Governments. In these circumstances we do not consider it desirable that the Paper should be amended in order to dealwith the question raised in the preceding paragraph.When, however, the time comes for a copy of the Paper to be handed to theLiuted States Administration we consider it advisable that our representative should make it clear that, in the opinion of the United Kingdom Government,the proposals in regard to buffer stocks described in paragraph 12 represent the essence of the plan and that, whilst the quota regulation of exports may benecessary for a limited number of commodities in certain special circumstances,it is only acceptable subject to the safeguards outlined in that paragraph. Ifthe War Cabinet share this view we suggest that our representatives shouldbe furnished with a statement which they could, if necessiiry, use as an aide-memoire when handing a copy of the plan to the United States Administration.The draft of such a statement is annexed to this memorandum.* W.M. (43) 50th Conclusions, Minute 2 (3).[25376]
5. My Committee have also considered the timing and method of our approach to the United States Government. It may be that representatives ofproducer interests at the Food Conference will put forward restrictionist schemesof a kind which we could not contemplate, and that our delegates will in such circumstances find it necessary to explain in some detail the plan outlined in w.P. (43) 97. If there is a serious risk of this happening, we think that theplan should be communicated informally to the State Department before theopening of the Food Conference. If, on the other hand, it becomes clear that itwill not be necessary for our delegates to the Food Conference to do more thanadumbrate the general principles underlying the plan, we think it would be preferable for the communication of the plan itself to the State Department to wait until after the termination of the Food Conference. The questions which itraises are more specific than the terms of the Agenda of the Food Conference,and we would prefer that they should be separately examined as a separateproblem. We might then hope that the United States Administration would be willing to open discussions with us on the general question of international economic and financial relations in the post-war world (of which the international regulation of primary products represents one aspect) as an essential preliminary to consideration of these problems by the United Nations as a whole.These are delicate matters on which only those who are in contact with theUnited States Administration during the days immediately before the openingof the Food Conference will be in a position to form a sound judgment.6. We accordingly recommend that our delegation to the Food Conference,in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and the Treasury representative in Washington, should be given discretion to hand a copy of the plan set out in w.P. (43) 97 to the State Department at the moment which appears to them tobe most opportune and at the same time to speak in the sense of the attachedstatement, leaving a copy thereof to serve as an aide memoire if this appearsadvisable.K. W.Treasury Chambers,Great George Street, S.W.1.April 30. 1943.Draft Statement.The British proposals are designed to represent a balanced plan in whichthe legitimate interests of producers are safeguarded no less than the interestsof consumers.In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, theproposals relating to buffer stocks outlined in paragraph 12 of the memorandum are the essence of the scheme. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomrecognise that the quota regulation of exports may be necessary for a limited number of commodities in certain special circumstances. They wish to make itclear, however, that they regard such schemes as acceptable only subject to the safeguards outlined in paragraph 14 of the plan.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have thought it advisable to make their views in this matter clear in order to ensure that the inclusion ina &quot;plan which they are putting forward of provision for the quota, regulation of:exports should not be interpreted as meaning that the restriction of the produc-tion of primary products essential to the standard of living of all countries is.in their judgment, inherently desirable.
