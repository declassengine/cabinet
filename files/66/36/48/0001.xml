Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 198.May 10, 1943.WAR CABINET.POLISH-SOVIET RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN view of the statement by the Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign affairs and the counter-statement by the Polish Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,which weie published in The Times of.the 8th May, my colleagues may be interested to read the attached note on the question of the evacuation of the Polish forces from the Soviet Union, which has been prepared bv Mr. W. D. Allen of the ForeignOffice.A. E.Foreign Office, May 10, 1943.THE statement by M. Vyshinsky and Count RaczynskFs counter-statement which are published in The Times of the 8th May bring out into the open thequestion of responsibility for the evacuation of the Polish forces from the soviet union last year. This matter has. of course, long been a bone of contentionbetween the Soviet and Polish Governments, who have exchanged a number ofheated but inconclusive notes on the subject.It may therefore be worth while attempting to assess the rights and wrongsof the case in so far as this can be clone from the information in our possession.The following seem to be the salient factors involved in the dispute :  (1) A agreements.The Polish-Soviet Agreement of the 30th July, 1941, provided for theformation on Soviet territory of a Polish army subordinated in an operationalsense to the Supreme Command of the U.S.S.R. The Polish-Soviet military agreement of the 14th August, 1941, supplemented the original agreement and made provision for the formation on Soviet territory of Polish land warfareunits, whose number and numerical strength should depend on the number of personnel available and the possibilities of the supply of material. It was laiddown that the Polish armed units should operate, in general, in formations of notless than a division.These provisions seem to provide a good basis for the Soviet contention thatit had throughout been maintained that the Polish units should fight on theEastern Front in the Soviet Union. Their vagueness about the numbers of Polesto be recruited and the manner in which they were to be supplied was, however,responsible for many of the subsequent difficulties.(2) Numbers to be Recruited.In November 1941, when the effectives of the Polish Army in the U.S.S.R.had already reached 46,000 men, the Soviet military authorities informed thePolish Command that the Polish Army could not exceed 30,000 men, and rationswere limited to supplies for that number.12030   [25423]
In December 1941 the matter was discussed between General SikoTski andPremier Stalin, with the result that the numerical strength of the Polish Armyin the Soviet Union was fixed at 90.000, while a further 27,000 men were to be evacuated to Libya and the United Kingdom.In March 1942 Premier Stalin informed General Anders that, in view of difficulties of feeding and equipment, the effectives of the Polish Army in theU.S.S.R. must be limited to 40.000 and that the surplus above this number wouldbe evacuated to the Middle East. The limit was shortly afterwards raised to44,000.On the 14th May. 1942. the Polish Ambassador was informed in a note fromM. Molotov that. Polish troops to the permitted number of 44.000 having alreadybeen recruited and assembled, no further recruitment might be permitted andthat no more Poles could be evacuated from the U.S.S.R. because of transport difficulties.In June 1942 Sir A. Clark Kerr reported that, on instructions fromPremier Stalin. M. Molotov told him that the Soviet Government had beenwatching with some concern developments in the military situation in Egyptleading up to the fall of Mersa Matruh. He recalled that the Prime minister had told him in London that if there were in Russia any Polish soldiers over and above the needs of the Soviet Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government would beglad to take them over and equip them for use in the Middle East. There werein Russia three Polish divisions, well trained but not fully armed. While theSoviet Government were loath to weaken their own front and while the transferof these Polish troops therefore presented some difficulty, they were ready to place them at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in order to fill the gaps causedby recent severe fighting. Sir A. Clark Kerr added that he understood that this plan would not be unwelcome to the Poles.(3) Feeding and Ecjuipment.While Premier Stalin, in making his offer of the Polish troops to HisMajesty&apos;s Government, was careful not to make much of the difficulties of supplying the Polish troops, there is little doubt that these difficulties played animportant part in determining his decision. In March 1942 the soviet ambassador explained to the Secretary of State that the Soviet Governmentdefinitely took responsibility for feeding the Polish troops. Unfortunately,however, the promise of wheat supplies which had been made by the UnitedStates Government to the Soviet Union had not been fulfilled. This was thereason for the Soviet Governments decision to limit the number of the polish forces to 44.000. This would allow of three Polish divisions bein&quot;- created inRussia. Two of these would be armed by the Russians, but they asked that thethird should be armed by us. He added that Premier Stalin had made it clear toGeneral Anders that it was for the Poles themselves to decide when any of then-forces were in a position to fight. There was no question of their being throwninto the battle before they were ready. If those Poles, in excess of the 44.000 inthe Army in the U.S.S.R.. who were now to be trained in Persia were pronouncedready at some later date to take part in the fighting on the Russian Front, then the Soviet Government would be glad to make provision for them. They wouldfeed and maintain but not equip them.In the event, the Soviet Government, apart.from the difficulties over food,did not find it possible to provide adequate equipment for any of the Polishdivisions. General Sikorski. in a letter which he wrote to the Prime minister on the 3rd August. 1942, about the disposal of the troops evacuated from Russia,stated that the Polish Governments original plan, in accordance with the spiritof the Polish-Soviet Agreement of the 30th July, 1941, was to fight the Germanson the Russian Front. Unfortunately, inadequate armaments and food supplieshad made it difficult for the Polish Army in Russia to reach a state of readinessin a short time. In the space of one year not a single shipment of Britisharmaments reached the Polish forces in Russia. Such being the position, these troops had to leave Russia in order to take up the fight on another fi&apos;ont againstthe Third Reich and its allies.&apos;(4) Political and psychological motives.While difficulties of supply were no doubt a determining factor, it wouldbe a mistake to assume that they were alone responsible for the difficulties thatarose. It may be taken for granted that not all the Poles in the Soviet Union(most of whom had fought against the Russians in Poland in 1939, had been
taken prisoner and. deported to the Soviet Union and had subsequently been interned in conditions of serious hardship) were as ready as General Sikorskihimself to forget the past and fight henceforth side by side with the Russians.It is true that in the early days after the amnesty for Polish prisoners providedfor1 under the 1941 agreement they rallied to the colours with remarkableenthusiasm. But past memories remained and were played upon by presentanxieties. Many of the men knew that their families had probably fallen intoSoviet hands, but they had been unable to trace them. There was also the questionof the 8,000 odd Polish officers who were known to have disappeared withouttrace. These preoccupations, coupled with traditional antipathies, naturallymade it difficult for the two sides to co-operate wholeheartedly. It is undeniablethat at times the Poles showed a tendency to attach conditions to their collabora-tion with the Soviet forces. The Russians, for their part, also not unnaturally,tended to resent this disposition on the part of the Poles to attach reservationsto their collaboration in the Strugs le. Difficulties of this nature undoubtedlycropped up at every turn and made the development of mutual confidence virtually impossible.A further consideration which seems always to have been present in the minds of the Polish High Command was the fear that the Polish Army, if usedon the eastern front, might lend to lose its individuality and to become mergedin the Red Army. In this connexion it is interesting to note that, in his letterof the 3rd August to the Prime Minister referred to above, General Sikorskiemphasised that the Polish Government attached primary importance to theprinciple of assembling the Polish forces in the Middle East into one indivisibleoperational entity, which would not be disrupted when ready for action in orderto carry out different military operations. He added that this point of viewcorresponded with the feelings of the Polish nation, which eagerly followed theactivities of the Polish forces abroad, wishing for their concentration and not for their further dissipation.(5) Conclusion.The most that can be said is that the matter is not so simple as eitherM. Vyshinsky&apos;s statement or the Polish reply would suggest. It was not purelya question, as M. Vyshinsky says, of the Polish Government refusing to allow the Polish forces to be used against the Germans on the eastern front; still less is it true, as has been suggested in some Soviet quarters, that the polish troops themselves were unwilling to fight in Russia. On the other hand, it isnot fair, as the Polish statement suggests, that the whole responsibility for theremoval of the Polish troops from the U.S.S.R. should be attributed to the SovietGovernment, The truth of the matter was perhaps that General Sikorskrsagreements of 1941 with Premier Stalin attempted too much. Events showed that it was not possible for enemies to become fully co-operating allies overnight,especially at a time of such serious strain and stringency as obtained in SovietRussia in 1942.W. D.
