It contains,in paragraph 24,  a list of questions on which decisionsore required,3*      I soggost that tho answers to these questions shouldbe in the affirmative.      If my colleagues acqept this view and also approve the general line of policy expounded in thememorandum,  the memorandum will survo as a basis both forthe preparation of more; detailed instructions for ourdelegates and for preparatory conversations before the conference with the State Department and the representativesof tho Dominions,^cat George Street, S.W.I.,22nd iipril,  1943,

m^m^kahtjum   on policy to be adopted ATTHE FORTHCOMING IHtSRKAT10NAL POOD conference,      The following paper submits for the consideration ofMinisters, an outline of a general policy which might headopted &quot;by the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s government at the forthcoming International Pood Conference.Desirability of Practical Objectives2.      If the Conference is to he conducted with a sense ofreality it must be concerned with practical aims and practical problems.    In a world in which people arestarving,  academic discussions of ideal standards of consumption and production run the risk of derision.Consideration of such matters,  if it takes place at all,must arise as a.consequence of the consideration of more urgent and more immediate problems.&quot;The&quot;Problem of Shortages3.      The immediate problem of food policy which willconfront the United Nations at the moment of victory, willbe a problem of shortage.    The release of the territoriesat present occupied by the enemy will mean,  for the timebeing at any rate, an increase rather than a diminution of present stringencies;    apart from difficulties of transport,anacuto short ago of fats, meats, and dairy prodicts in particular islikely to persist for some years.    In these circumstances there is real danger of a disorderly scramble for supplies,and a sharp rise of prices, which would aggravate theproblem of mal-distribution and increase the difficultiesof avoiding general inflation&apos;while making it impossible to sustain our own stabilization policy.4.     To cope with this problem it is necessary that thereshould be common agreement to use centralised buyingmachinery and to keep in being arrangements for pooling and controlling international shipping.    It is desirable,

moreover, that any mechanism which co-ordinates other international purchases and sales should be used as faras possible for co-ordinating the procurement of supplies required for relief purposes.    The problem of relief isin many respects separate from the problem of general shortage,  and will be dealt with at a separate conference.But,  in respect of procurement, the two problemsnecessarily overlap, and it is desirable that the mechanism which deals with the one should also deal so far aspracticable with tho other.5s      It is suggested,  therefore, that, from the outset,the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government shoulddirect the attention of the Conference to the existenceof these problems, and should endeavour to lead it to seekfor their solution in a common agreement to use, and develop,  during the period of stringency,  joint machineryfor co-operation in this field.    It is, however, doubtfulwhether the Conference will provide a suitable occasion for the discussion of delicate constitutional details;it is probably desirable that the delegation should confine itself to the advocacy of the acceptance&apos;of thegeneral principle of co-ordinated production, purchase and allocation.6,      If this principle be adopted,  it carries with it important implications,,    agreement to refrain from unco-ordinated purchase abroad - i.e.  acceptance of thecontinuance of the allocation system - necessarily involves the continuance of some degree of control of consumption athome.    Moreover, the implied commitments thus involved willprovide a valuable guide to governments anxious to plan thereadjustment of their agricultural production, ce speciallyanimal husbandry, in the years of otherwise shifting and^certain demand,  immediately following the war.    there seems, therefore, much to be said for making a virtue of

necessity and expressing willingness to continue in common with others while the stringency persists,    tho rationing of consumption.7.      Similarly,, the principle of co-ordination must involvethe maintenance and development of measures to secureincreased production.    It is desirable,  thereforej that weshould take the opportunity of the presence ofrepresentatives of a largo number of food producing countries to improve; our methods of trickling the mostimportant shortages.    It is common knowledge, for instance,that the action so far taken to increase oil seed productionin Belgian Congo and French West Africa, leaves something to be desired.    It is probable that by a concerted drive toincrease production, wo may achieve substantial results,It Is submitted that only in some such way can we satisfytho Governments of territories now occupied by the enemythat everything possible is being done to make supplies available for eventual use in liberated territory.    without some such action it may well be difficult to get agreement to the continued use of existing allocation machinery.The Position of the Exporters6.      If agreement is secured on the neopssity for taking steps to meet the exigencies of the immediate shortage,there can be little doubt that the representatives of the primary producers will demand some quid pro quo.    They willsay,  &quot;If we take steps to extend production to meet theneeds of the moment, and if we agree to refrain fromprofiting from the immediate shortage, what guarantee is there that, when tho transition is passed, we are not to beleft exposed to the insecurities of the world market, andthe risks of over-production?&quot;9.      It is fundamental to the interests of this country that such demands should not be met by the organisation of

restriction schemes of a type which will maintain prices undulyand deny to consumers the benefits of economic progress.      Thiscountry, dependent as it is upon reasonable prices for theessential commodities which it imports,  stands to lose morethan any other from arrangements of this sort.      It is to &quot;be hoped, therefore, that our delegates will be vigilant inavoiding the least commitment to any schemes of such a type.But, equally, it is to be hoped that we shall not be contentmerely to stone-wall.      We should attempt to direct thediscussion of this problem on to new and more fruitful linesby putting forward positive suggestions of our own.10.    For this purpose,  two lines of policy suggest themselves.We can put forward the broad principles of our own plan forthe stabilisation of primary products and we can exploit the emphasis on the desirability of raising nutritional standards,which appears in the invitation to the Conference.Commodity Stabilisation11.    The novel feature of the scheme for the stabilisation of primary products is that, while providing a mechanism forthe elimination of violent short-term fluctuations in prices,and for sustaining markets during general depression, it lays down rules which ensure that basic prices change in harmony with changes in the underlying conditions of international supply and demand and that the benefits of technical progress are notdissipated by restriction.      The scheme.is not limited to this;it contains provisions whereby, in exceptional circumstances,recourse may be had, with due safeguards, to quantitative regulation.      But the essence of the plan is expansionist;    itis a policy v/hich, while it confers on primary producers the legitimate benefits of stabilised markets, seeks to safeguard the - interests of consumers in general and importing countries inparticular against the abuses of stabilisation.      It is suggested,

therefore, that advantage should he taken of the recent   author-isation of the War   Cabinet    that our representative shouldexpound to the Conference the broad proposals of the pian* asprinciples which His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under con-sideration,  without, however    any special commitment.      It shouldbe explained that, possibly   n these lines, are to be found thebeginnings of a solution of the problem of securing prices whichare at once fair to producers and to consumers.12.    It is not suggested that the propounding of these general principles should lead to discussion of controls for particular commodities.      It is satisfactory to observe that the Addendum tothe draft Agenda circulated by the State Department makes it clearthat such is not the intention of the United States Authorities.It is highly undesirable that, at this stage, attempts should bemade to elaborate detailed schemes of control for individualproducts.      If our representatives are forthcoming in propoundingthe general principles of solution of the problem of commoditystabilisation they will be in a stronger position to resist anyattempt to enter into premature discussions of detail.NUTRITION POLICY13.    Beyond this,  it is suggested that the representatives ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government have a very powerful hand to play instressing certain aspects of general nutrition policy.      The case for raising general standards of nutrition by measures of inter-national policy can be  stated, and often has been stated, with greatextravagance and confusion of thought.      It is not possible, bypassing resolutions, to remove the conditions of poverty and mal-nutrition prevailing in many parts of the world.      Nor is itdesirable that international conferences should attempt to dictateto the different nations of the world&apos; uniform measures of nutritionalimprovement or agricultural policy.      Tastes differ;    and so do thepolitical, social and physical conditions which determine policy &apos;

regarding agriculture.      Nevertheless, much can be done byresearch and pooling of information to promote practicalnutrition policies;    and it is greatly to the interest of thiscountry that any measures of international investment which are organised by the United States, or other creditor countries,should be directed, in the first instance, to the improvement ofthe conditions of agricultural production - the reclamation ofland, the carrying out of large-scale irrigation work, theimprovement of means of transport and storage and of marketingand processing facilities - rather than to exaggerated attempts to force the pace of the industrialisation of backward areas.It would certainly be most unwise for our representatives to oppose the normal course of industrialisation   or to show a mani-fest lack of sympathy with the desire of over-populated agri-cultural communities to find industrial outlets for their eurpiuspopulationsc     But since investments,in the forms of developmenthere contemplated are often difficult to get going without Govern-mont intervention on a large scale, there is everything to be&quot; said for throwing our influence in this direction.14.    It is suggested,  therefore,  that, without indulging ininvidious comparisons,  the representatives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might well point to the general desirability ofnational policies    and international investment designed toraise standards of nutrition.      And, without making recommenda-tions which might prove embarrassing to the representatives ofother Governments, we might contribute to the discussion of such measures some account of our own experience in this respect, bothSt home and in the Colonial Empire.15.      So far as experience at home.is concerned, we have much to claim in the shape of existing achievement.     We can draw attention, in the words of the Prime Minister, to our traditionalPolicy of extensive imports.      We can make much of the progress of nutrition policy even amid the difficulties of war.     We can shownows in spite of exiguous supplies, we have controlled distribution

and prices so as to provide minimum standards., fonr-the- poorest-,-,classes of the people.      Some account might be given of ourexperiments in the provision of meals in schools and cheap milk for children and expectant mothers, with due reference to the con-sequential effects on demand for the products of domesticagriculture.      It should be pointed out further that the recent decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to provide family allowances&quot;both in cash and in kind is likely to tend to raise both generalstandards of nutrition and the demand for protective foods.      Wehave moreover, much to contribute from our own experience to any  &quot; -discussion of the improvement of agricultural technique.16,      While our experience at home may be used to illustratenutritional policies which proceed by the way of redistribution of income,  our experience and our intentions in the Colonial Empiremay be used to illustrate methods of improving nutritionalstandards by encouraging new forms of production, and promotinginvestment designed to facilitate agricultural development.      Someaccount might be given of the actual measures which have beenadopted in the last few years..    We should frankly recognise thatsuch progress as has already been made is only the beginning of alarge task;    and some indication might be made of the programmes which we have  under consider at ion.The Question of Machinery17.    The question arises whether we should wish that the conference should lead to the setting up,  at this stage, of some more permanentbody which by research and advice should attempt to forward the realisation of these objectives.18,    The argument against such a step is fairly obvious.      It is undesirable at this stage to set up ad hoc international bodiesbefore we know the outlines of the main post-war international&quot;Economic axrthorit ies.      In particular, it would be most unfortunateto inaugurate an institution which might compete or overlap with &apos;

bill the proposed General Commodity Council proposed in ourstabilization plan.19,   Against this, however, two very powerful arguments canbe mustered.Firstly, there would seem to &quot;be a good case on merits forsome continuing international organisation, dealing on the onehand with consumption needs and on the other -with effectiveagricultural production to meet these needs.      More specifically,without attempting any undue centralization such an organisation would co-ordinate and promote research, both on the side of foodconsumption and of scientific agriculture;    would draw up worldstatistics and establish international norms;    would serve as a centre and clearing house of information;    would assist &quot;the dissemination of improved systems of farming and methods of production;would seek to advance standards of nutrition, particularly in low-standard countries;    would make surveys of feeding and nutritionalconditions in such countries,  so as to be in a position to indicate the necessitous areas in which occasional world surpluses might be most usefully disposed;    and would likewise indicate areas wheredevelopmental loans and grants to agriculture might be extendedto the best advantage.Such an organisation could be so designed as eventually tobecome part of a Food Division of the General Commodity Council,if such an integration were thought desirable,      In any case its functions could be so defined as to eliminate any dangers of competition and overlapping, particularly as many foodstuffs are notamenable to treatment under the Stabilisation Plan,Secondly, it seems highly probable that, whatever we do, amost determined attempt will be made by other delegations,especially the delegat ions from the exporting areas, to set upsuch a body:    and it is at least possible that such proposals would, involve a constitution and a definition of functions

inimical to the interests of consumers and importers.      If we aren0t ready to take the initiative with proposals on lines which donot conflict with our own long-term interest, we may very wellfind ourselves confronted, with others which do,20.    It seems, therefore,  tht t there is a good case for our takingthe initiative and proposing that steps should be taken to bringsuch an organisation into being.      It is not suggested that theconference should be asked to agree to any formal Inauguration, but rather that some continuing committee should be set up to v/ork outdetails of a provisional constitution and eventually to bring it tothe notice of the authorities concerned.      One of the immediatetasks of the Committee might well be to direct and organize the continuation of any inquiries set on foot by the conference -concerning measures for meeting prospective shortages.Connection of wider economic questionswith Food Policy31.    Having opened up vistas of development in these positive and practical directions, it is suggested that we should proceed topoint out that the rate at which progress can be made concerningeither joint or individual action in any of these directions is inevitably influenced by international policy on a number of other questions, not within the range of food policy.      It would be impracticable for the representatives of European countries to enterinto commitments.      Improvement in standards of nutrition depends toa large extent on economic well-being in general and this is vitallyaffected by action designed to promote exchange stability and the prevalence of reasonable commercial policies.      Changes in agricultural policies may often involve an additional burden on a country&apos;s balance of payments.      A country&apos;s willingness to .litigate the obstacles to the import of food will depend on itsprospect of openings elsewhere for the products of itsManufacturing   or   extractive   industries* Capitalexpenditure   which   helps   food   policy   -   e.g*    on*9w

transport - is part of thy wider question of international capital investment.22.    It is not desirable that these wider questions should be investigated at the present Conference, still less that anycommitments in these respects should be entered into.      But itis to be hoped that, having approached the general problems offood policy in the positive spirit suggested above, and havingindicated that satisfactory solutions in this field would be greatly helped by the achievement of satisfactory solutions ofthese other wider problems, the representatives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would command the support of the Conference if they proposed that the discussion of these matters should be dealt withby other more appropriate bodies.      It is believed that it was with some such object as this in mind that the President chosefood policy as a method of opening the discussion of the general international settlement.Agricultural products other than Food23.    The foregoing paper has been concerned chiefly with questions relating to food policy and food products, and it is understoodthat the centre of gravity of the Conference will reside in this field.      In so far, however, as problems relating to non-foodagricultural products come within the Conference&apos;s terms ofreference, it is suggested that the general principles outlined above are an appropriate guide to policy.      That is to say, weshould seek to confine the discussions to an appropriate planeof, generality not entering into commitments in regard to particularproducts.      We should emphasise the need for maintaining and developing appropriate machinery for dealing with shortages.    And,in so far as questions of long-term stabilisation arise, we shouldstress the importance of the principles embodied in our own plan for the stabilisation of primary products.

QUESTIONS FOR DECISION24.    The War Cabinet has already decided that our representatives maydivulge to the Conference the broad principles of the plan for thestabilization of primary products.      The following questions await the deision of Ministers: -(1)    Whether the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould be empowered to press for the acceptance by theConference of the principle of co-ordinated production,purchase, shipping and allocation for the period ofstringency after the war.(2)    Whether they should be empowered to announce our willingness to continue rationing during this period.(3)    Whether they should be instructed to avoid commitments in regard to the control of particular commodities.(4)    Whether they should approach the broad problem of the raising of nutritional standards on the lines suggestedin paragraphs 13.-16 above.(5)    Whether- they should advocate taking preliminary steps towards the creation of an international foodorganisation as suggested in paragraphs 19-23 above.(6)    Whether they should take the line that discussion on general economic, financial and monetary questions should be subsequently and separately dealt with andnot remitted to committees-or sub-committees of theFood Conference.
