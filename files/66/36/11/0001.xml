this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 161.April 26, 1943.TO  BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.REDUCTION IN THE STRENGTH OF ANTI-AIRCRAFT COMMAND.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.IN accordance with the Prime Ministers instructions (Annex), we have, inview of the stiingent man-power situation, carried out a detailed examination,in consultation with the Commanders-in-Chief concerned, of the possibility of reducing the Anti-Aircraft Command in 1943, and report as follows : 2. We propose to effect a reduction of 26,250 men below the basic allotmentof July 1942 and to fix the ceiling for A.A. Command at 180,000 men and77,000 A.T.S.   The 1942 ceiling for A.T.S. was 110,480, but 77,000 is themaximum number which can now be provided.3. It should be possible within this man-power ceiling, by means of certainexpedients, such as a greater use of the Home Guard and the introduction ofremote control, to provide approximately the same degree of Anti-aircraft defence for this country in 1943 as was provided in 1942, taking into account the growing number of points now to be defended. Comparative figures for the guns manned and deployed are as follows :- Estimated Deployment.at September 1943.2,180(plus possibly 216 from field Army). -1,720(plus possibly 360 from field Army).4. On this basis we consider that our air defences should be adequate tomeet the possible scale of enemy air attack as estimated for 1943, and we aretaking steps to bring the A.A. Command within the target figure given inparagraph 2 above. (Signed) H.A.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1, D.A pril 26, 1943.Heavy gunsLight gunsApril 1942.1,888812April 1943.2,2601.450R. MOORE, V.C.N.S.E. NYE, V.C.I.G.S.C. S. EVILL, V.C.A.S.ANNEX.Prime Minister&apos;s Persqnal Minute, Serial No. D. 168/2.General Ismay (For C.O.S. Committee).So far as can be ascertained, it is far more expensive in man-hours to bringdown an enemy aircraft by fire from the ground than by fighters from the air. Itis true that there is some danger of interference with our present radio methods which would probably render it inexpedient to reduce our flak this winter. Butnext year, when we hope these dangers will be overcome, and when there shouldbe more fighters available, it might be possible to rely on aircraft in greater measure. Anti-aircraft guns will, of course, always be useful and, indeed, necessaryfor the defence of small important targets, but in view of the looming man-powerstringency, the possibility of further reducing A.A. Command in 1943 should be explored. W. S. C.[25326] 30.9.42.
