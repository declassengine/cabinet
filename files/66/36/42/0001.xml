WAR CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary&apos; of State for the Colonies.WHILE I took the opposite side to the Prime Minister on the 1939 white paper, I recognise that the policy was highly controversial and that there are many in the present Cabinet who were opposed to it. For the time being, however,the primary concern of all of us is with the war and the first object of our policyin Palestine must be to prevent any outbreak of disorder which, starting inPalestine and perhaps spreading thence throughout the Middle East, might seriously interfere with military operations.But. when the end of the war comes, opponents of the White Paper will naturally wish that we should consider the whole policy afresh and see if some new and better solution cannot be found. It will be the duty then of theSecretary of State for the Colonies to place before the Cabinet possible alterna-tives, and they are being examined. Certainly, in such an examination, the-important new possibilities described by the Prime Minister must be closely inves-tigated. Meanwhile, however, there are two matters of which the Cabinet shouldtake note.2. The situation in Palestine, which remained stable during the early yearsof the war, has recently deteriorated. Opinion, both Arab and Jewish, inPalestine has been hardening; both sides are becoming increasingly restless andthe authorities feel growing concern over the possibilities of the future.In the attached note I give an outline of the developments during recent months.3. The period of five years, during which under the White Paper jewish immigration was permitted, ends on the 31st March, 1944. Thereafter, underthe White Paper, the continuance of immigration will depend on Arabacquiescence, and this in the present state of racial feeling will certainly not be forthcoming.This is obviously a matter which I shall have to bring before the Cabinet ata later date, though no decision will be necessary for several months. I proposeto send out in the near future the head of the Middle Eastern Department of theColonial Office to study the position on the spot and to discuss the matter withthe High Commissioner and his advisers. Meanwhile, we can see how thesituation develops, particularly in regard to the admission of Jewish refugees from South-Eastern Europe.O. S.Colonial Office, May 4, 1943.[25399]Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1943..SECRET. Cop, No. 9W.P. (43) 192.May 4, 1943.
DEVELOPMENTS IN PALESTINE DURING RECENT MONTHS.The Jews.THE passing of the &quot; Biltmore &quot; Resolutions at an American ZionistConference in New York in May 1942 brought about a revival of political activityamong the Jews in regard to the future of Palestine. These Resolutions, in brief,are :  (1) that there should be formed a Jewish military force, fighting under itsown flag and under the High Command of the United Nations;(2) that Palestine should be established as a Jewish Commonwealth; and(3) that the Jewish Agency should be vested with the control of immigration into Palestine.2. Concurrently with the passing of these Resolutions, which have beenopenly adopted by the Zionist Leaders in Palestine, there has been very consider-able pressure and publicity-in America and in this country for the establishmentof a Jewish Army and for throwing open the gates of Palestine to unlimitednumbers of Jewish refugees from Europe. The publicity given to the Jewishaspirations on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Balfour Declarationnaturally encouraged Zionist hopes and evoked correspondingly adverse commentin the Arab press.The result, in brief, of these activities has been that the Zionists have come out into the open with their demand for the establishment of a Jewish State inPalestine after the war, and there is evidence that some of their leaders have, in private, not disguised their intention to fight for their aims after the war should this prove necessary.3. The Zionists may well feel that they can resort to force in the long runbecause there exist in Palestine two powerful and well-armed clandestine Jewishmilitary organisations. The Hagana, the leadership of which is generallyassociated with the Jewish Agency, is reputed to have a strength of 80.000; whilethe Irgun Zvai Leumi, the Revisionist illegal army, is believed to number from6,000 to 8,000.The Hagana is highly organised on military lines, with a staff and divisionaland lesser commands, and it is believed to employ a permanent salaried staff to supervise training, accumulate arms and transport, and control the village groups.It also commands the services of expert technicians for the manufacture of bombs, &amp;c. There are mobile and fixed units, the former for use in any part ofthe country, the latter at particular tactical points, ft has a sufficiency of armsfor all its members. The arms include a proportion of machine guns, automaticweapons and bombs. Stocks of ammunition are said to be considerable. Illegalwireless transmitting sets have been established for the purpose of co-ordinatingaction in case of emergency. Many members of the Hagana received militarytraining in Continental Armies before coming to Palestine. Some 30,000 ofthem have received training in Palestine itself as regulars or auxiliaries in thePolice or as members of His Majesty&apos;s Foi-ees. The Irgun Zvai Leumi are believed to hold the same types of arms as the Hagana.The large numbers of arms illegally held by the Jews has long been regardedas a definite threat to security, but the decision not to take drastic measures toobtain possession of them was taken by the War Cabinet in February 1940 andhas not been varied since. This decision was based on the importance of avoiding action which might hamper the war effort by arousing such resentmentin Zionist circles as would involve the loss of some Jewish support inthe war and might cause an outbreak of Jewish riots and terrorism,involving the detention in Palestine of British troops required elsewhere. In a recent report the G.O.C., Palestine, estimates that forcible disarmament would hea major military undertaking involving the employment of a minimum of two infantry divisions and producing consiclerable unrest and disorganisation of thewar effort. Even if the necessary troops could be made available, it is clear thatsuch an operation could not be contemplated at the present time.The Arabs.4. The recent claims of the Zionists have revived the apprehensions of theArabs, and there has been in consequence a recrudescence of Arab political activity both in Palestine and outside.   Nuri Pasha is interesting himself in the
possibility of holding a general Arab Conference in Cairo or Baghdad for full discussion of the question of Arab union or federation and considerable publicityhas been given to this in the Middle East. He has sent special envoys to other arab States to ascertain the attitude of the leaders there to this idea. particular interest has been aroused in Egypt, where a statement was recently made in the senate that the Egyptian Government should first approach the various ArabGovernments concerned and ascertain their opinions and later invite representa-tives to a meeting in Egypt. If an understanding were reached, the next step would be to assemble in Egypt an Arab Congress to complete the examination ofthe problems and to take final decisions thereon.His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken the line that such a Conference wouldbe premature, that it would not reach useful conclusions unless much spade-work had been done beforehand, and that it might give rise to dangerous agitation toan extent that would embarrass the war effort. The first step should be for theleaders of the Arab world to enter into confidential discussions without publicity.Nuri Pasha has stated that he agrees to the necessity for preliminary discussions,and that he intends shortly to visit Cairo to discuss the matter personally withNahas Pasha.In Palestine the Zionists&apos; campaign has given rise to feelings of alarmand exasperation which are reported to have spread among all classes of theArab community. A move to convene a general conference of leading Arabs tocreate an Arab political body which could represent and speak for the Arabs ofPalestine has so far not materialised, as the individual who sponsored it failed toobtain the support of other influential Arab groups in the country.5. The Arabs have no organised illegal forces corresponding to the Haganaand the Irgun of the Jews, and a serious internal revolt would depend on thepresence of rebel leaders of acknowledged authority and on the provision of funds.Hut there is no doubt that the Arabs individually hold a considerable number ofarms and a stock of ammunition; and a number of them has received militarytraining, either in the Police force or as members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces. It isnot possible to give even an approximate estimate of the number of illegal arms in the hands of the Arabs, but it is considered that the numbers are sufficient to constitute a serious threat to security. They are not usually hidden in largecaches but are concealed in houses or in the hills near the villages, and in the eventof serious trouble the Palestinian Arabs would, in all probability, receivesubstantial aid in men, money and arms from the Arabs of neighbouring countries.6. During these months of increasing tension the United States Governmenthave had an independent witness on tour in the Middle East. This officer,Colonel Hoskins, was so impressed by the dangers of the situation that, on thecompletion of his tour in January, he gave the Minister of State a paraphrase ofhis report to the State Department, part of which reads : &quot; Present indications are that, unless preventive measures are taken, fighting may break out in Palestinebetween the Zionists and Arabs before the end of the war, possibly even thisspring, and lead in turn to Arab-Jew clashes in other parts of the Near East.&quot;While neither the Minister of State nor the High Commissioner considers thatthere is in fact much danger of an imminent outbreak of serious trouble betweenJews and Arabs, the High Commissioner has expressed the view that it is inevitable sooner or later if the ardour of the Jewish official bodies continuesunabated.7. While I agree that there is as yet no reason to fear any violentmanifestations in the immediate future, there is obviously much combustiblematerial in Palestine and every effort must be exerted to avoid an explosion. Evenif we cannot prevent an ultimate outbreak between the two races in Palestine,I feel we must be extremely careful while the war lasts to avoid any action whichis likely to exacerbate either race.
