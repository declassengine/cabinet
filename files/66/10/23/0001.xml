THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet, July 1940.SECRET.W.P. (*0) 292-July 30, 1940. .   .TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.INDIA.THE following telegrams from the Viceroy to the Secretary of State set outthe replies from the Governors of the Indian Provinces to the Viceroy&apos;s references to them, regarding his conversations with Jinnah and Gandhi.(1)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State for India, dated july 6, 1940.(Immediate.)1264-S. I have now received, and have repeated to you, replies from allGovernors to my reference to them regarding my conversations with Jinnah andGandhi, and Jinnah&apos;s memorandum of 1st July. General sense of replies may,I think, fairly be described as (a) favouring expansion of my Council (thoughTwynan sees arguments against, force of which I do not, of course, overlook) :(6) favouring declaration, the general feeling being that it would be well to goas far as I went with Gandhi, while Lumley would go even further. Here againTwynan doubts case for any immediate declaration; (c) that we should withoutdelay torpedo the extremer requests contained in Jinnah&apos;s memorandum of1st July, even at the risk of failing to secure Moslem League co-operation :(d) that the problem of non- (.? official) advisers in Section 93 Provinces is onewhich will need further careful consideration and very cautious handling : thatthere is much to be said for waiting until we see reactions of any expansion atthe Centre, and that reflection in the provinces of action taken at the Centreshould not necessarily be a condition precedent of the matter : finally that if thereare to be political non-official advisers in Province (as to which there is somedifference of opinion and for which there is certainly little enthusiasm) it wouldprobably be well to keep at any rate one official adviser; that non-official advisers should be chosen having regard to importance of Communities, &amp;c, from which,they come in Province, and that there should be no nomination of such non-official advisers from the Centre.2. I have separately recommended to you that it would be (corrupt group)to make clear to Jinnah that he could not expect us to go at all so far in the wayof guarantees as he has suggested.3. We are in agreement that subject to Cabinet approval there should be a,declaration, and I am working (? on your) draft. It has been impossible to let[21563-2] &apos;       copy No.
you have a reply to-day. It is conceivable that I may not be able to let you havea reply by Monday, but I will do my best. The issues involved are so important that&quot; even if there should have to be some further delay (which I will do my best to avoid), that would be preferable to embarrassment which a hasty draftedmanifesto on this difficult subject might give rise to, and I am sure you will agree as to that.BOMBAY.(2)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Immediate.)1217-S. My telegram No. 1216-S of 3rd July. Following is the governor of Bombay&apos;s telegram No. 368 of 3rd July. Begins: My comments are asfollows :- 1. Main issue. As I see present position, we are keeping element willingto co-operate at arm&apos;s length in hope of getting Congress to come in. If therewere reasonable expectation of getting them all in, including Congress, it wouldbe worth continuing present position for some time longer; but from your lastinterview with Gandhi it looks as if there is no hope of getting Congress inexcept on their own terms,&apos; which, even if we were to accept them, would be entirely unacceptable to Moslem League and other willing elements. If that canbe held to be point now reach(ed, omitted), I think there would be dangers inmaking no move to rally those who are willing to co-operate. The loyal elementswould be discouraged and, believing that we would do nothing without Congress,would turn their attention to making terms with Congress. More dangerousmight be Moslem development. So long as they are not actively engaged on our side, I should be apprehensive that (sic: ? of) an unfortunate turn in war whichin all Moslem countries might push them into definite estrangement. We wouldthen be left with little active support. Therefore, although this is a Provincein which Congress influence predominates and in which Government withoutCongress co-operation cannot be satisfactory, I come to the conclusion that, on grounds wider than this Province&apos;s interests, we would be wise to attempt toclinch the support of those who will help rather than risk being left with little or no support.2. Declaration. If that course were adopted the possibility that congress would be permanently antagonised and might go in for trouble is obvious.I think, however, it is not being over-optimistic to believe that there is a rising-dissatisfaction with all leaders who are continuing their political manceuvringsinstead of getting on with the war. If on top of this feeling there were adeclaration which could be regarded by many Nationalists as satisfactory,Congress would find it difficult to make trouble. I think, therefore, that it wouldbe of the greatest importance to make a declaration, going as far as that whichwas sketched out with Gandhi in your last interview. I would even favour goingfurther and saying that the recommendations, apart from defence, &amp;c, on which agreement was reached between major parties, would be accepted by HisMajesty&apos;s Government. Some declaration seems a necessary forerunner to anywidening of central or provincial administration. Without it we should riskappearing to be angling for Moslem plus some anti-Congress support; but adeclaration, if it made some advance on previous ones, would stand a good chancenow of rallying enough support to make a coalition for prosecuting the war worthwhile, beside putting Congress in the wrong and in a poor position from which to make trouble.3. Jinnah&apos;s conditions. Jinnah&apos;s further conditions outlined in yourtelegram 1198-S (? of) 2nd July seem to qualify considerably his willingness to accept your offer of last November. If he sticks to them, it would be difficultto form anything but a Moslem League front at the Centre and in Provinces, andhe would appear to be working not for a coalition to prosecute the war, but forMoslem domination... He has, however, a reputation here of taking up an extreme
position at the beginning of a bargain, and I should hope he could be shiftedfrom them. The following arguments against practicability of - those of hisconditions which affect the Provinces occur to me :-(a) It will not, in any case, be easy for the Moslem League and Mahasabha,or other Hindu elements, to work together, and to start from thebasis that Moslem League must everywhere have a majority, ifCongress does not come in, would prevent all co-operation.(p) Jinnah no doubt expects that an understanding would be reached underwhich the Governors would usually accept the advice of non-official advisers. The Moslem population here is 8 per cent, of the whole.Even if Moslem League represented every Moslem, the controllingvoice of my Advisers would represent only 8 per cent, of the peoplefor whose welfare (? I am) statutorily responsible to Parliament.Such position would antagonise nearly every Hindu and might well lead to communal trouble in which Governor would be identified with one side.(c) If League Advisers have to be in a majority in this Province, there wouldbe no room, excepting at very large Cabinet of Advisers, for other elements, some of whom are more important than Moslems. If, forexample, there were as many as 3 League Advisers, representationwould be given to only 2 out of the other groups, such as the depressed classes, Liberals, Mahasabha, Par si, to say nothing of regionalinterests. I think it would be quite impossible to have a moslem league majority amongst Advisers in this Province.. 4. N on-official advisers.-Assuming that Jinnah modifies his conditions,although (? I do not) look with any enthusiasm on the suggestion of non-official advisers, I would be glad to make the best (? of them) if they are necessary inthe general interest. The chief difficulty which I foresee in this Province is thatany team which I could secure would not carry much public confidence, and I doubt if it would secure much more support for the war than I have got atpresent. More Moslems would come on to War Committees, although someMoslem Leaguers are already co-operating. As against that, Gujerati merchants,if Congress held aloof, would probably be less disposed than they are even nowto help financially. Provincially, therefore, non-official advisers would bring littleadvantage. If, however, it becomes desirable to pursue the idea, I would putforward the following suggestions for consideration :  (a) that non-official advisers should not be appointed simultaneously with theexpansion at the Centre; they should come later, after reaction tofirst step had been gauged. If expansion of the Centre met with considerable public approval firstly, non-official advisers would have a(1 better) (% chance) of making an auspicious (? start).(b) The possibility of retaining one official adviser, e.g., Wiles, in thisprovince should be considered.(c) If I could get Jayakar my team could be improved.(d) A preliminary understanding as to how far Governors would accept theadvice of advisers would be essential. Would advisers constitute a council with right of tendering joint advice?(e) Jinnah and other leaders who came in would, I assume, give definiteassurances that their intention was to give whole-hearted support inprosecuting the war, and would be prepared, if necessary, to suppresssubversive movements, including Congress.(/) (? Specified) volunteers, such as Moslem League, National Guard andMahasabha volunteers, should not retain their organisation, but should join the Civic Guard as individuals.BENGAL.(3)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Immediate.)1223-S.   Reference my telegram No. 1216-S.   Following from Governor of bengal, 77, 3rd July.   Be gins: &apos;&apos; Following is text of reply referred to in my immediately preceding telegram.   I (? take) it that Jinnah being prepared to[21563-2] b2
come in on the basis of last November means that he does not want declarationof a date and that value of such declaration would be to reassure HinduNationalist element. If so, I can well imagine that Gandhi sees in this a threat to Congress Hindu solidarity. You will know whether declaration of date canbe made without (? frightening) Jinnah, but such declaration seems to imply an ultimatum to communities to settle by a given date or to submit to a communalaward.2. You will recall Fazlul Huq&apos;s (? views) (? in his) letter of 25th June. Hehas no liking for Jinnah&apos;s dictatorship, and it might be helpful if you saw him and, if I may suggest it, (? Sikendar) also before a final conclusion. A formulaconsistent with Huq&apos;s views would be that co-operation in war government of parties representative of all communal interests would be most promisingfoundation for settling balance of internal power at the earliest possible date.3. I refrain from comment as to non-official advisers, but I would be con-siderably (? omission)ed by early prospect of inclusion of forward Bloc element in Bengal or if by their inclusion in Centre implied forward Bloc influence overBengal politics. I definitely suspect that Jinnah&apos;s suggestion of forward Blocelements has close relation to Bengal, where on various occasions, as explainedverbally, Siddiqui Ispahani and Nuruddin, who represent urban or commercialas opposed to agrarian Moslem interests, have manoeuvred Government into aposition of antagonism to Europeans and flirtation or open alliance with SubhasBose. The conflict over jute having been removed amidst sarcasm from Bose&apos;press is immediately followed by threats of damaging Holwell in Calcutta, inwhich Bose is in league with Siddiqui Ispahani.This trouble is a deliberate attempt to sabotage an amicable settlement and bring into forcible conflict with Moslems and undermine European goodwill.If this trouble is not averted, it may result in Bose&apos;s arrest (I (? learn) since this telegram was drafted that it has done so), but (? Nayudum) Uddin is obviouslyhesitant to attack Bose on an issue where Siddiqui and Company are behind him.I cannot conceive of Bose&apos;s co-operation in war effort being sincere, and it would arouse grave misgivings and probably strong resentment amongst Europeans.Indians who genuinely support war effort would accuse us of again desertingfriends and placating enemies.4. I regard a combination of this nature as dangerous, and though EazlulHuq may flirt with Bose to strengthen his individual position against his Leaguecolleagues, I think he might go as far as an attempt to break the League in Bengal(for example, by a campaign of support to war committees in defiance of Jinnah)rather than see a League-Subhas combination developed against him. he proposes to see Jinnah soon about war committees, and for this reason as well asbecause of his (? views) as to a declaration it might be helpful if you were to see him. I venture to suggest your seeing Sikendar also, as these two are premiersof most important Moslem Provinces, and both appear to resent dictation fromJinnah.   Ends.(4)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Immediate.)1222-S. Reference my telegram No. 1216-S. Following from governor of Bengal, No. 76, dated 3rd July. Begins : Nothing in this telegram alters viewsI had expressed in a reply drafted to your telegram No. 1185-S of the 1st July,and which I am accordingly despatching in my immediately succeeding telegram.Ends.(5)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 16, 1940.1384-S. Following telegram No. 86 dated 15th July from Governor of bengal repeated for information. Begins : Although rather against declarationwhen I was at Simla, I consider that as a result of your talks a different situationnow exists. Therefore, I entirely agree statement should be made as suggested inyour letter dated 11th July.   Will report reactions to statement when made.
PUNJAB.(6)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 5, 1940.1241-S. Reference my telegram No. 1216-S. Following from Governor ofthe Punjab, dated 4th July, is repeated for information : Begins: As I told yourExcellency orally, my first reaction to the news contained in your telegramNo. 1185-S of 1st July was that we should leave Congress out of account and go ahead on the lines of Jinnah&apos;s offer; but Jinnah&apos;s letter, the substance of which you communicated in your subsequent telegram of 2nd July, entirely alters thesituation. His demands, especially (&amp;) and (c), are altogether extravagant and&quot;usurious.&quot; Demand (c) is contrary to all democratic canons and would, ifconceded, put Jinnah more or less in the position of a &quot; dictator.&quot; For moslem league executive is, I believe, nominated by him and most of them are men with little stake in the country, coming from Provinces where Moslems are in a minority. They really represent very little. Several of the nominees from the punjab are mere men of straw and political opponents of Sikendar. If, as seems probable, Jinnah&apos;s real object is to secure a monopoly of power for himself andhis caucus both at the Centre and in Section 93 Provinces, a bargain with himon these lines might actually have the effect of (? weakening) and discouragingthose elements in the country which really desire to sink political issues and standtogether with us in face of the present dangers.In the circumstances, I agree with Your Excellency that you should comeback at Jinnah at once and point out to him that his new proposals are in certain respects quite unacceptable.2. It looks as though the attempt to secure co-operation of Congress or the moslem League will have to be regarded as a failure. At the same time, there isan obvious and pressing need for some action which will hearten very considerablenumber of people in this country to help and will give them a real share in shapingof the war policy.3. The Governments of two major Provinces (Bengal and Punjab) and twominor Provinces (Assam and Sind) are already co-operating. Perhaps, therefore,a possible course would be to give representatives of these Governments places on your Excellency&apos;s Council. Seeing that they would be nominees of popularlyelected governments, this would be a means of giving popular representativessome voice in the general conduct of the war. It might be possible to add repre-sentatives of special communities, e.g., orthodox Hindus, Sikhs, or depressed classes, who would be willing to co-operate.4. It is also for consideration whether some further declaration should notbe made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the lines sketched by yourExcellency in your talks with Gandhi. Presumably some statement will have tobe published by your Excellency regarding these talks, and I venture to think(despite Gandhi&apos;s opposition to such a course) that this statement should explainnature of offer made and include a pronouncement regarding His Majesty&apos;s.Governments attitude towards India&apos;s political future. I believe that Sikendaris in favour of a pronouncement such as you outlined to Gandhi and it might possibly be encouraging to those moderate elements who feel that India&apos;s fate is bound up with Britain&apos;s, but who are still doubtful about Britain&apos;s politicalintentions.UNITED PROVINCES.(7)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Important.) &apos;1221-S. Following telegram from Governor of United Provinces. Begins:Am (? most) grateful for your letter dated 29th June, in particularparagraph^ s) 9 to 11.   Refusal of Congress to co-operate certainly affords no
reason (? why) we should not accept assistance from others; but Jinnah&apos;suggestion that you should include certain Left Wing Sikhs and certain LeftWing elements of Congress is so surprising that it might justify inference thathe belongs to Fifth Column.2.   In my opinion distinction must be drawn between (a) Steps which might be desirable to effect restoration of (? constitutional)working, and(b) Extra constitutional steps designed merely to broaden basis of govern-ment without any question of restoration of constitutional working,it being recognised that Section 93 is working smoothly.3. As regards Provinces, I can see much danger in Jinnah proposals, butI will dealt (sic) with this below when considering position of Centre. In theProvinces it is a purely practical question. In my opinion no combination is inany degree likely in this Province at least to make possible restoration of constitutional Government unless the main body of Congress comes in. Even if in the other Provinces such a combination is mathematically possible, I do notbelieve that such a strange partnership as Jinnah suggests would hold together for more than short period. We are dealing therefore with situation (b) ofparagraph No. 2 above and not with situation (a), and objections in my vieware fully set out in paragraph No. 4 of your letter dated 30th April concerningunofficial adviser.4. As regards Centre, we are also clearly dealing with situation (b), for normal constitutional working is now proceeding (? at) Centre. I fully admitadvantage of expanding your Council even without Congress, and it is at(? Centre) that popular support for war effort is more obviously desirable.There would clearly be advantage in securing adherence of (? Moslems) and alsoMahaha Sabha, especially as lessening danger of a head-on collision on communalfront of which you speak, and which might arise from independent settlement(? with) Moslems. Depressed classes are loyal though ineffective. Inclusion ofLeft Wing, however, would in my view be most dangerous and entirelyundesirable. Nor would it in my view make possible a restoration of normalgovernment in provinces. Left Wing Sikhs I regard as comparable to Bengaliterrorists. Their inclusion, apart from acute inherent danger, would alienatemany of our supporters and our Right Wing well-wishers in Congress. I also consider that any proposal for expansion based otherwise than on an obviousmajority vote should include those who are helping us in the war, (? the)(? propertied (? classes) and Liberals, and I agree that this might be effected bysuggestion in paragraph No. 11 of your letter regarding an Advisory Committee.5. To summarise, in my view it is at the Centre that broadening of basis isrequired, since Centre originates most all war effort. Expansion in Provinces,for reasons already in these circumstances considered, is not desirable. What Ibelieve to be false hope of establishing constitutional government in Provincesshould not persuade us to take in at Centre Left Wing element fundamentallyinimical to British connection. This, in my view, is most dangerous. Sincedrafting above I have received your telegram No. 1185-S. I think only one further point arises, namely, possibility of Congress feeling and precipitatingdirect action. I am convinced that broadening of provincial element which dealswith day-to-day administration otherwise than on basis of agreement on bothsides and in a manner not contemplated by Constitution would be likely to precipitate crisis, and this affords additional argument against action inProvinces at least till reactions of Central developments have been experienced.Central sphere of government, though more directly connected with war effort, ismore further removed from politics which interest the ordinary man, and whilethe danger of crisis cannot be overlooked, a purely Central development onincontestable lines does not carry the same risk. If as a result Centralexpansion crisis does arise, it is essential to have present Government inProvinces, and this affords additional reason for waiting to see the results of(? changes) at Centre.
Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Immediate.)1228-S. Reference my telegram No. 1216-S of 3rd July. Following telegramfrom Governor of United Provinces is repeated for information. Begins : &quot; Yourtelegram No. 1198-S. I have already replied to your telegram No. 1185-S.As far as I understand from your letter of 29th June and your telegram No. 1185-S,Jinnah has changed his ground almost completely. At first he did not ask for anyfurther declaration about ultimate constitution, though he did just refer (para-graph 12 of your letter) to Pakistan. He also expressed his readiness to co-operateif allowed to do so from inside the Government. But he appeared to mean that representatives of other parties opposed to Congress should also (sic) brought in at the Centre and possibly Provinces.2. He now makes demand for double assurances that approval or consentof Moslem community essential to any constitutional change and principle of fifty-fifty Moslem representation and control should be accepted. First pointhas been covered by your previous correspondence with Jinnah, while seconddemand at this stage at least seems even more (? omission) to accept. Theimmediate result of any such categorical, assurance would be not only to provokeCongress, but also alienate from us (? other) (? Hindu) opinion in British Indiaand States.3. As regards immediate proposals for the Provinces I need not repeatarguments contained in my telegram G. 46 against non-official advisers. HereJinnah appears to have gone beyond his 50-50 demand. Even were non-official advisers appointed in the provinces, the appointment of Moslem majority ofadvisers in provinces predominently Hindu would not be merely unfair to non-Congress Hindus who form mass of population, and would not only provokeCongress to civil disobedience, but would cause revulsion of Hindu feeling ofall classes against us and might lead to something perilously like civil war. Sucha measure could not be justified merely on the ground of non-co-operation of congress.4. At the Centre, though scarcely less unjustifiable, it might (? just) bepossible to give League a majority of additional members in view of existingcomposition of your Council, but if at the same time League had a majority on proposed War Committee this again would alienate Hindus. Here again non-co-operation of Congress cannot justify (group omitted) of Hindu majority to position of minority.5. I feel that there is no alternative but to point out to Jinnah the respects in which his proposals are unacceptable. This may lead to split in moslem league and to (? many) at least of leaders coming definitely over to us.BIHAR.(9)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Immediate.)1220-S. Reference my telegram No. 1216-S. Following from Governor ofBihar, 40 of 2nd July : Begins: If Jinnah and other political parties mentionedare prepared to come in provided your Excellency&apos;s Council is expanded toinclude non-officials, it would, in my view, be extremely difficult to refuse their assistance. Such refusal would give him and others a good excuse for adoptingan attitude of at least malevolent neutrality on the ground that it argued that your Excellency and His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded Congress as the onlyimportant political party in India, without co-operation of which a nationaleffort could not be undertaken. At the same time, as a matter of tactics, is it notpossible to distinguish present situation from the November offer with itsinsistence on communal agreement in Provinces as a pre-requisite to expansionof Central Cabinet?   Could not Jinnah or some other party leader be induced
to invite your Excellency to declare whether, in view of refusal of Congress toco-operate and impossibility of fulfilling essential November condition, you areprepared to forego that condition ? In this case your Excellency might, Irespectfully submit, repeat November offer and add that, if Congress is stillunwilling, you are prepared to carry on with those who are prepared to help.If this line of approach to problem is for good reason ruled out, I should stilladvise a rapprochement with Jinnah and other non-Congress parties. We mustnot leave them with grievance that hand of friendship has been refused.2. I am sensible that the course of action contemplated may provoke breachwith Congress and precipitate a (sic) active campaign against us. Is not suchcampaign sooner or later inevitable ? We have in any event, so far as our knowledge and wisdom permitted, made preparation for such contingency.3. We are in agreement regarding the drawbacks of non-official Adviserin present circumstances. Nevertheless, the addition of non-officials to yourExcellency&apos;s Council would force us to an analogous arrangement in the Provinces.Moslem League would certainly press for appointment of non-official advisers and would receive strong support from non-Congress Hindus who have alreadyrepeatedly demanded the association of non-officials with Governor in Section 93situation. Only thus could we ensure 100 per cent, support in the Provinces. Iwould, however, strongly deprecate dictation by non-officials at the Centre inregard to personnel to serve as Advisers in the Provinces. So far as Bihar isconcerned, Jinnah&apos;s hope that Section 93 may prove unnecessary is fantastic.4. To sum up, my views are as follows: Co-operation of non-Congressparties will be real asset in the war effort. It will commit us to nothing in future.It may involve active resistance by Congress. For that we are not unprepared,and, in view of present divided opinions within Congress, the time may not beunpropitious for a fight.   Ends.(10)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Immediate.)1226-S. Reference my telegram No. 1216-S. Following from Governor ofBihar, No. 41, dated 3rd July. Begins: Views expressed in my telegram No. 40were based on assumption that Jinnah was prepared to co-operate if given, withother parties, some representation in councils of Central and Provincial Govern-ments, such as one member in your Excellency&apos;s Council and one Adviser toProvincial Governor. His latest terms appear to demand, as condition of hisco-operation, practically one hundred per cent, acceptance of extreme (? Moslem)case now and for future. This would be wholly unacceptable to other non-Congress parties, who almost certainly would hold aloof even if they did notactively oppose us, and (? I have) doubts whether his own League would supporthim if he insisted on his present demand. I am certain that non-CongressHindus in this Province would desert me if Jinnah claims are recognised. Inthese circumstances, I respectfully submit Jinnah should be brought back toearth.   Ends.CENTRAL PROVINCES.(11)Telegram from the Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 5, 1940.(Important.)1245-S. My telegram 1216. Following is Governor of the Central Provincestelegram 274-M.S., 4th July. Begins : Your Excellency&apos;s personal and most secrettelegram 1185-S of 1st July. Disadvantages that I see in Jinnah&apos;s proposal isthat it does not carry us much further or achieve ultimate object, which is to securethe support of the moderate Congressmen. On the other hand, expansion of theExecutive Council and taking in of non-official advisers from elements opposedto Congress, which have not the support of the majorities, or at any rate, the strong minorities in the Legislatures may only exacerbate the situation vis-a-visCongress, and may tend ultimately to increased communal and party ill-feeling.Such a challenge to Congress might bring about change in Gandi&apos;s attitude in
respect of Civil disobedience, or satyagraha. While therefore the expansion of executive Council by the inclusion of Moslem, scheduled caste and other membersmay meet with approval in the non-Congress provinces, I (? confess) that I doubtvery much whether this move will ease the political situation, and if it doesnot make for efficiency, which is all-important at this juncture, I think the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. In my judgment the great majority ofthe members of the Legislative Assembly and their constituents in the provincesare not keenly interested in the affairs at the Centre though they are certainlykeenly interested in the Provincial affairs. Ends. I doubt, therefore, whetherexpansion of the Executive Council on the lines proposed will cut any ice withthis class which is politically articulate class.2. Disadvantages mentioned above will be more marked in the provincialsphere, where communal, party and personal rivalries ai-e more acute than atthe Centre. I am, therefore, not in favour of taking in non-official Advisers inthis province because, if taken from Legislature, they would have to be chosenfrom small groups of 14 Moslem and 20 Scheduled Caste members, of whom7 are Congress in a House of 112; or from disgruntled Congressmen, who wouldthen lose what influence they possess. If non-official Advisers were not taken from the Legislature, it would be difficult to find persons of suitable standing.Non-official advisers would not bring any accession of popular strength to theGovernment in this province, where administration is functioning without difficulty. On the contrary, persons so appointed would probably lose whatinfluence they might possess in the Legislature or outside. In short, argumentsset forth in your secret letter dated 30th April and accepted in Wylie&apos;s replydated 6th May undoubtedly still hold good. Moreover, there is reason to supposeex-Prime Minister Dr. Khare (? may) secure support of more Congress members and perhaps be in a position to form Ministry once it is (1 clear) working committee will not agree to resumption of office. Khare appears to have been only 15 short of a majority when he saw the Governor in May last, and he expects to get more supporters once the intransigent attitude of Congress as regardsassumption of office is known.3. My own view, based on personal contacts, is that a lead from HisMajesty&apos;s Government is essential as is expected and desired by Congress,notwithstanding their assertion of right to settle their own constitution. Localintelligence indicates that group in Working Committee consisting ofKajagopalachari, Syed Mahmud and Asaf Ali even now favour immediate return of Congress ministries. This group might adopt strong responsive attitude toa clear-cut scheme. Ex-Premier Khare is a representative of respective Iyengaristschool of thought among Congressmen.4. In my judgment present time of anxiety is not opportune fordeclaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government because all of us are suffering more orless from war neurosis and release of controversial matters now would imposeadditional strain. On the other hand I believe a statement now that a declarationwill be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government when present crisis has passed, and, inany case, not later than early in New Year would relieve present tension. If sucha statement is made there is, I think, much to be gained by leaving well alone in interval between this statement and a clear declaration of policy regardingconstitutional developments in India. Above was drafted before receipt of yourtelegram No. 1199-S of 2nd July. That telegram confirms me in view that it is best to leave things as they are until clear and detailed scheme of politicalprogress can be formulated.   Ends.ASSAM.Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(12)(Immediate.)1224-S. Reference my telegram No. 1216-S. Following from governor of Assam, No. 436, dated 3rd July, 1940. Begins : Information contained insecond telegram so alters situation that I feel that comment on first is of little value except on very general lines. Conditions described in second telegramseem to me to be intolerable and to prevent further progress unless modified.Those in first telegram appear fairly reasonable and I have suggestedacceptable (sic) subject to some modifications, taking the line that Recusancy of[21563-2] c
Congress was no reason for refusing to accept offer of parties ready to be friendly.We should at least know where we are. I would, however, object to proposal inparagraph No. 1 that Centre should dictate personnel of local non-official advisers, a negation of provincial autonomy.2. I feel that some alternation of present position is most desirable, thoughobviously it cannot proceed on the lines outlined in your telegram. Whateverhappens I venture to think that some declaration would be greatly welcome, butform of declaration is a matter of great importance.3. Regarding non-official Advisers, if Assam came to Section 93, I think-that it would be feasible, though personally I should still (? prefer) officialAdviser.   Ends.NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE.(13)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Important.)1219-S. My telegram No. 1216-S. Following telegram from Governor ofthe North-West Frontier Province. Begins: I am in favour representatives ofMoslem League and other non-Congress parties being included in yourExcellency&apos;s Council even though Congress remain obdurate.I am, however, still opposed to non-official adviser (1 scheme), because(a) this would probably lead to trouble with local Congress party; (b) there wouldbe no positive gain to balance this risk, particularly as the quality of possibleadviser here is poor.Jinnah personally do not (sic, ? does not) appear to command by any means unanimous following amongst our local Moslem League, and I hope fortheir co-operation with district Committees in spite of (? Jinnah&apos;s) recentpronouncement.   Ends.Following telegram from Governor of Madras. Begins: I have consultedBoag only. Both he and I are of opinion you should offer expansion of CentralGovernment to include all parties, and if Congress refuses, should proceed to expand without them, whatever attendant risk, which in this Presidency we areperfectly ready and willing to face. I should, however, not interfere with section 93 Provinces for moment. The vital things at present are defence,foreign policy, &amp;c, which are the prerogative of Central Government, and that is realised by all. A newly-formed Central Government would be most popular,and fact that Congress refused to come in despite present situation would takeaway (? a) lot of their prestige. I would not, however, agree with suggestionthat Central Government as expanded should nominate or suggest non-official advisers for Section 93 Provincial Government. This must be left to provincial government, if and when it is considered necessary to appoint them.Candidly, I think what all India is (1 waiting and) looking forward (? to)is a strong and expanded Central Government, and that at moment provincial governments are not so important. The feeling is that war must be won, and(? that) it is Central Government rather than Provincial Governments which can do this.  Ends.SIND.(14)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Important.)1218-S. My telegram 1216-S. Following is Governor of Sind&apos;s 87. Begins:I have been discussing all possible alternatives for some time and have not thoughtit necessary to make any fresh contacts after the receipt of your telegram.2. I am convinced that you would be running grave risk by awaiting any longer the pleasure of Congress. Risk which you would be running is that ofalienating those who are anxious to co-operate with you actively in the prosecu-tion of the war.   I would therefore say publicly that you can wait no longer for
nCongress to modify its unyielding attitude and that you must take steps forthwith to call in to share with you responsibility of Government representatives of allthe extensive elements which are anxious to co-operate.3. I would recommend further that, simultaneous with this enlargement ofyour Cabinet, you should make larger offer indicated in your telegram, to effectthat action now taken is not inconsistent with further (? discussion)s on part ofall sections of Indian opinion with a view to presenting an agreed solution toHis Majesty&apos;s Government, exempting always those matters which you are convinced must continue to be reserved for separate settlement, e.g., defence, &amp;c.4. Fact that Gandhi begged you not to take this course is to my mindimmaterial and only indicates that you would be cutting ground from beneathhis feet and alienating from him all reasonable elements. As I see the position,you cannot hope to satisfy Congress : what you have got to do is to isolate it sothat less enthusiastic portions drop off.5. As regards Provincial Government, I should not envisage any changein constitution of my Ministry, bad as it is, in pursuance of any pronouncementfrom you, though I have my own idea how to try to improve it. As regards theProvinces under section 93 regime I would certainly approve setting up of a body of Advisers who would have same relations to Governor as members of yourExecutive Council have to you.6. You must be prepared to take the risk of Congress attempting activecampaign of civil disobedience, but I still believe that it would fail from internaldisaffection without cause [sic) us undue inconvenience.7. I do not think it necessary, as regards 93 Provinces, to say more thanthat there is not there the same degree of urgency, but you will consider favourablyany proposal to associate with Governor, representatives of all co-operatingparties. There is no reason why change at Centre should be delayed, as itinevitably would, by making corresponding changes in Provinces.   Ends.(15)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Immediate.)1225-S. Reference my telegram No. 1216-S. Following from Governor ofSind, No. 88-C, dated 3rd July : Begins: In continuation of my telegramNo. 87-C of yesterday.2. Gandhi&apos;s letter and matter which he has released to press about his intention of persuading all British men to adopt passive resistance creed clearlyestablishes need of breaking off all negotiations with him. I do not know whetherit would be possible for you to drive wedge between Gandhi and some of the otherCongress people, e.g., Satyamurt, or even Rajagopalachari.3. I do not know strength of Moslem League in other Provinces, but youclearly say you consider some of Jinnah&apos;s supplementary demands as objectionable.I should say his proposal to oust all Moslem elements other than Moslem(? League) is impossible and that he must be tackled on this ground. I do not know what percentage he could be offered; perhaps two Moslem Leaguers to onenon-Moslem Leaguer on your enlarged Council and on Advisory Councils inSection 93 Provinces.4. Certainly there need not be any announcement for or against Pakistanproposal; but if you put yourself in the hands of Moslem League, is there nota risk of your being interpreted as having accepted Pakistan ?   Ends.ORISSA;(16)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 4, 1940.(Immediate.)1227-S. Reference my telegram No. 1216-S. Following from governor of Orissa 60-S, 3rd July. Begins : If as seems certain in view of Gandhi&apos;attitude, Congress will not co-operate, I agree that the plan of expanding theCouncil by taking in prominent men of other parties is likely to rally to the war
effort all the others and the risks set out at the end of your telegram should beaccepted. I presume that your Excellency will consider the advisability of bringing in the representative of the landholders as well, if none on existingCouncil. I take it the expanded Council would command safe majority in theAssembly. I agree also that in this event it may be desirable to bring in thenon-official advisers in Section 93 Provinces, although in Orissa there appears tobe no demand for them and to allow new Counsellors, or preferably the council as a whole, some voice in their selection. But I suggest the decision in this respectbe taken by your Excellency after consulting the enlarged Council. I would urge the retention of at least one official adviser in each Section 93 Province tolessen the burden of the Governor who will still be solely responsible. I amsetting out peculiarities of Orissa situation at length by letter.2. I had drafted so far when I received your Excellency&apos;s telegram No. 1198of 2nd July. Jinnah&apos;s new position seems to me preposterous and wouldcompletely alienate support from any quarter but his devoted followers. It wouldbe absurd in Orissa to take in as Advisers two of the four Moslem members ofthe Legislative Assembly, of whom one at least gives very doubtful allegiance toMoslem League, and to have only one other non-official adviser. I stronglysupport idea of your Excellency telling Jinnah that his new proposals are quiteunacceptable and would press again my view that a cut and dried formula forSection 93 Provinces administrations as a condition precedent to expansion of governor-General&apos;s Council, would be a great mistake.   Ends.July 30, 1940.
