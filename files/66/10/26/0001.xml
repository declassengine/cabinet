INDIA.Paragraphs 1 to 6 of the Viceroy&apos;s Draft of Proposed Statement.(Reproduced from W.P. (40) 283.)1473-S. Private and Personal. India&apos;s anxiety at this moment of critical importance in the world struggle against tyranny and aggression, to contribute to the full to the common cause and to the triumph of our common ideals, ismanifest. She has already made a mighty contribution. She is anxious to makea greater contribution still. His Majesty&apos;s Government are deeply concerned that that unity of national purpose in India which would enable her to do soshould be achieved at as early a moment as possible. They feel that some further statement of their intentions may help to promote that unity. In that hope theyhave authorised me to make the present statement.2. Last October, His Majesty&apos;s Government again made it clear that dominion Status was their objective for India. They added that they were ready to authorise the expansion of the Governor-General&apos;s Council to include a certain number of representatives of the political parties, and they proposed the establishment of a consultative committee. In order to facilitate harmoniousco-operation, it was obvious that some measure of agreement in the Provincesbetween the major parties was a desirable pre-requisite to their joint collabora-tion at the Centre. Such agreement was unfortunately not reached, and in thecircumstances no progress was then possible.3. During the earlier part of this year I continued my efforts to bringpolitical parties together. In these last few weeks I gladly entered into conversa-tions with prominent political personages in British India and the Chancellor*of the Chamber of Princes, the results of which have been reported to His\ -Majesty&apos;s Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government have seen also the resolutions. passed by the Congress Working Committee, the Moslem League and HinduMahasabha.4. It is clear that earlier differences which had prevented the achievement-of National unity remain unbridged. Deeply as His Majesty&apos;s Government regretthis, they do not feel that they should any longer, because of those differences,-postpone the expansion of the Governor-General&apos;s Council, and establishment ofa body which will more closely associate Indian public opinion with the conductof the war by the Central Government. They have authorised me accordingly to invite a certain number of representative Indians to join my Executive CouncilThey have authorised me further to establish a War Advisory council which would meet at regular intervals and which would contain representativesof Indian States and of other interests in the national life of India as a whole.5. The conversations which have taken place, and resolutions of bodies which I have just mentioned, made it clear, however, that there is still in certain quarters doubt as to the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government for theConstitutional future of India, and that there is doubt, too, as to whether the
position of minorities, whether political or religious, is sufficiently safeguardedin relation to any future Constitutional change, by assurances already givenThere are two* mam points that have emerged.   Op those two points HisMajesty&apos;s Government now desire me to make their position clear.6. The first is as to the position of minorities in relation to any future constitutional scheme. It has already been made clear that my declaration oflast October does not exclude examination of any part of either of the Act of 1935or of the policy and plans on which it is based. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsconcern that full weight should be given to views of minorities in any revisionhas also been brought out. That remains the position of His Maiesty&apos;sGovernment.  &apos; J    JIt goes without saying that they could not contemplate transfer of theirpresent responsibilities for peace and welfare of India to any system ofGovernment whose authority is directly denied by large and powerful elements in Indians national life. Nor could they be parties to coercion of such elementsinto submission to such a Government.New paragraph 7&apos; drafted by the Prime Minister to take the place of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Viceroy&apos;s Draft.-Mr V Ji- J - Jfc Af--fi&quot; &quot;7V- -TV- -A&quot; &quot;7v- Tf7. The second point of general interest is machinery for building withinthe British Commonwealth of Nations the new constitutional scheme when thatime comes. There has been very strong insistence that the framing of thafescheme, subject to provision for certain matters for wldch His Majesty&apos;s-Government cannot divest themselves of responsibility, obligations arising outof their long connection with India,] should be primarily the responsibilityof Indians themselves, and should originate from Indian conceptions of tire-social, economic and political structure of Indian life. It is clear that a mount when the Commonwealth is engaged in a struggle for existence is-not one in which fundamental constitutional issues can be decisively resolved.But His Majesty&apos;s Government authorize me to declare that they willmost readily assent to the setting up after the conclusion of the war of a bodyrepresentative of the principal elements in India&apos;s national life in..order to devisethe framework of the new constitution, and they will lend every aid in their powerto hasten decisions on all relevant matters to the utmost degree.  Meanwhile, they* The Viceroy&apos;s Draft referred to &quot; three points.&quot; This has been altered to two pointsconsequential on the revision of paragraph 7.f The words in italics were suggested by the Viceroy in substitution of the words &quot; subjectto provision for the matters mentioned above.&quot;
will welcome and promote in any way possible every sincere and practical stepthat may be taken by representative Indians themselves to reach a basis of friendly agreement, first upon the form which the post-war representative body should take, and, secondly, upon the principles and outlines of the constitutionitself. They trust, however, that for the period of the war (with the CentralGovernment reconstituted and strengthened in the manner I have described, andwith the help of the War Advisory Council) all Parties, communities and interests, will combine and co-operate in making a notable Indian contributionto the victory of the world cause which is at stake. Moreover, they hope that inthis process new bonds of union and understanding will emerge, and thus pavethe way towards the attainment by India of that free and equal partnership inthe British Commonwealth which remains the proclaimed and accepted goal ofthe Imperial Crown and of the British Parliament.
