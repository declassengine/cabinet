THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS MAJESTY^GOVBRMBNT TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.1 secret?(40) 297.By 51st,1940,WAR CABINET.Copy No.BRITISH GARRISONS IN NORTH CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of Estate forForeign Affairs.      x/The Cabinet will recall that at an early stage of their consideration of the Japanese demand for the closure ofthe Burma Road, it was decided in principle that if thedemand were refused it would be possible to withdraw theBritish garrisons from North China to offset the effect of a refusal on the Burma issue (see 17.1.189(40)),   In view ofthe apparent deterioration of the situation vis-a-vis Japan,I should like my colleagues to reconsider as a matter of urgency the possible desirability of withdrawing the garrisonsforthwith.2.   If this were done we should no doubt suffer acertain loss of prestige, but this would be less grave thanthe loss which would arise if, as a result of hostilities,our garrisons were forced to surrender.   If it were decidedto withdraw, this action would be based publicly on thenecessity of employing the troops elsewhere, and it may be thatthe announcement of our intention to withdraw would operate as a useful danger signal to the Japanese.3.   I append for consideration draft telegrams to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Shanghai and Washington, which areself-explanatoryo(Intialled)   H.FOREIGN OFFICE,51st July, 1940.

DRAFT TELEGRAM TO SIR A, CLARK KERR,  (SHANGHAI).Your telegram No. 610 [of July 19th:   British Troopsin Shanghai].General Officer Commanding Hongkong has reported to WarOffice that Japanese Naval and Military Commanders havenotified their intention of opening the French Concessionand International Settlement at Shanghai, including Britishand American sectors, to their soldiers and sailors on leavein uniform and in unrestricted numbers, though possiblyunarmed.2.    General Officer Commanding considers that this movewill entail our abandonment of the perimeter posts, whichwould become useless.   But he suggests, that m return weshould attempt to obtain recognition from Japanese of our right to retain troops at Shanghai as long as presentdisturbed conditions prevail in China, on the ground thatpresence of British troops is justified, like that of american marines, for protection of British lives and property.-5.    Apart from extreme improbability that the japanese would give such recognition, their action, however, must beconsidered in light of renewal of anti-British agitation in japan and recent arrest of British subjects,,   We mustreckon with possibility that Japanese Military, at all events,are out to pick a quarrel and that we may even be involvedin hostilities.   Even if they do not intend to go to extremes,Japanese military may provoke an incident with our troops at shangai and provide a&quot;pretext for armed intervention in the settlement in the course of which they might arrest anddetain British soldiers or otherwise make position of ourgarrison so intolerable that we might have to withdraw inhumiliating circumstances04.    In the absence of American military support wecannot offer forcible resistance in Shanghai and, in theevent of hostilities, troops will be urgently neededelsewhere.   His Majesty1s Government have therefore reachedconclusion that wisest course is to withdraw them at earliestpossible moment on our own initiative, for our own purposes and without regard to question whether Italian troops are alsowithdrav/n.   Necessary orders for preparation of withdrawalare accordingly being sent to General Officer CommandingHongkong.5.    Question of further consultation with United StatesGovernment before proceeding to this action has beenconsidered.   We feel however that further consultation would serve no useful purpose and might be unwelcome to the UnitedStates Government.    In particular, any suggestion on our partthat they should take over our sector might be embarrassing to them.   We have decided, therefore, simply to inform UnitedStates Government in advance of our proposed action in orderthat they may make any consequential arrangements which seem desirable to them.-6.    Decision will apply equally to detachments at Pekingand Tientsin but in this case we shall reserve our rights underthe 1901 Protocol when formally notifying the Governmentsconcerned.    Separate instructions as to notifications will besent to you in due course.Repeat to:     Washington,   Tokyo,   Hongkong for G.O.G.

DRAFT TELEGRAM TO THE MARQtffiSS OF LOTHIAN8 WASHINGTON.United States Government will be aware that a numberof prominent British subjects in Japan have been arrestedfor alleged offences against various Japanese laws for theprotection of military secrets, and that Japanese War office have instituted violent campaign against alleged Britishespionage network in Japan.&apos; There is no foundation whateverfor allegation that persons concerned have been engaged inespionage, and it is&quot;clear that the arrests are deliberatelyaimed by Japanese military against British community,probably at&quot;German instigation, with a view to producingcrisis in Anglo-Japanese relations.2c    We do not yet know whether action taken representsconsidered policy of Japanese government   We must, however,be prepared&apos;for further&apos;anti-British action on part of japan at a moment when we are faced with possibility of heavy German attack upon this country03.    In the light of this situation we have beenreconsidering posicion of our troops in Shanghai and havereached conclusion that we shall be in much stronger position if those troops are moved from Shanghai at the earliestpossible moment to places where they will be of greaterutility,4.   You should at once inform United States Governmentof this decision and of the circumstances in which it hasbeen taken.,   We felt that it would only be unwelcome tothe United States Government to consult them again and inparticular that it would be embarrassing to them to receive a request from us that American troops should take over theBritish sector in Shanghai,   Nevertheless we should like themto know of the decision in advance so that they may consider,before it is implemented, any consequential arrangements which they themselves may think it desirable to make in shanghai a5.   You should make it clear that decision appliesequally to detachments in North China (see my telegram to shangai No,     )*Repeat to:TokyoShanghaiHongkong for G.0,Ce
