To:- Ministry of Aircraft Production,From:- H.M. Consul General, New YorlcReceived P.3,5* (Tels.) 0845 hours 12.7*40*BRINY 64 11/7    IMMEDIATE.Following for ROWLANDS from Self.     Begins.Reference my Aircon 15 and your MAP.364*   MorrisWilson presided yesterday over meeting of Confederation ofCanada headed by Mr. Howe, Australia, headed, by Mr. Casey,South Africa headed by&apos;extremist H0LTH0U3E and Indiarepresented by Brigadier TUTE.2.     As reported to Dominions Office by United kingdom high Commissioner in Ottawa this meeting was convened atsuggestion of Mr. Casey to co-ordinate requirements of dominions for aircraft from United States so that compositepicture could be available to United Kingdom Government toconsider possibility of Confeceration allocating so far asUnited Kingdom needs will permit.3.     Canada&apos;s requirements are stated by Aircon 15.4.     Australia require 54 long-nose 2 seater fightersapproaching Defiant type, 238 Hudsons or equivalente 243general purpose d.ive bombers, 11 PBY flying boats, 23 naval co-operation type analogous to Walrus and 250 twin-enginedtrainers vice Ansons from United Kingdom,5.     South Africa requirements are not yet formulated butthey will probably want 350 medium sized long range bombers,200 long range single seater fighters and. 100 twin-engined,trainers conditional to Ansons from United Kingdom.6,     India aslis for 48 Curtiss Wright fighters and. -24Martin bombers (or equivalents) within limits on appropriationof 5i million dollars.   Brigadier Tute has cabled present prices which (? will) only allow of some 30 fighters and 15bombers for such expenditure.7*     All requirements are urged as necessitating earliestpossible deliveries with completion by the Autumn 1941.8.     To supplement present aircraft programme there arethe following possibilities;, viz:-(a) 300 Rexotifolic fighters could be produced by july 1941.     Performance slightly suiDerior to Hurricanes,Australia, South Africa and Ind.ia are examining suitabilityfor their fighter requirements.    This would mean allocation of375 Pratt and Whitney 1830 engines.     As an alternative we areexploring comparative merits of Grumman fighters talcing sameengine.    Examination on behalf of India must awaitMr. Tymns arrival (about 23/7)./ft)sAircon 15 attached.

(b) We are renewing application to Washington tosecure transfer of 144 Vultee fighters on order for Sweden.(c) 250 Brewster dive bombers similar to those on order under French contracts for delivery January to September1941.   Australia are considering for their general purposerequirement.    This would mean allocation of 310 Wright R.2600engines .(d) If 125 Pratt and Whitney 1830 engines were released 50 additional Hudsons could probably be secured for Australia in the Spring of 1941,    Otherwise no availabilitiesin sight for balance of Hudsons required by Australia nor formedium bombers (?) probably required by South Africa.    We suggest480 D.B.73 type aircraft ordered by French under Allied scheme from Douglas and Boeing considered as possible allocation in lieu of types more precisely meeting needs.    It may be practicable toarrange delivery to original D.B.7 specification.    This would saveheavy expansion changes adapted to French Army needs whilstoutput would fall by 25% if converted to British type B muchmore than 7B.    Moreover9 valuable Wright 1820 engines prescribedfor D.B.73 would be freed and surplus Pratt and Whitney 1830engines installed on reversion to D.B.7.Baker advises aircraft of original D.B.73 typewould not conform to United Kingdom war requirements whereasDominion representatives consider that as D.B.7 they might go some way to meet their needs.(o)   Africa would like 20 to    24   Martin 167 deliveriesfor their bomber requirement,(f)    Except for an order being negotiated by Canada forCESSNA type using Jacobs engines off Canadian contract, prospectof United States twin-engine D. trainer types vice Ansons arestopped by lack of suitable engines,9. To meet flying boat position Canada are about to order105 sets of parts for Consolidated P.B.Y.59 10 for erection in new flying boat plant in Canada.    Australia similarly intend to order 11 P.B.Y.5 boats.    It is assurasd 287 surplus 1830engines could be made available in second half of 1941 to meet this programme, if necessary continuing production of 1830type at expense of later 2800 type surpluses.10. Canada represent again need for allocation of 40 FrenchP.B.Y.5 boats mentioned in paragraph 4 of Aircon 15.    Australiaalso asks partial allocation therefrom to secure earlierdeliveries but subject to replacement later deliveries under their own order in Autumn 1941.11. It is hoped this statement in conjunction with Aircon15 will give composite picture of Empire&apos;s needs.    meeting was held solely to c o-ordinatc requirements as againstpossibilities for report to United Kingdom and other Governmentsconcerned.

It was realised that decisions as to allocation ofsupplies arc for inter Governmental consideration and. cannotbe prejudiced by this formulation of problems.12. Morris Wilson concurs and is telegraphing separatelyto Lord Beavcrbrooko    Copy is being sent to Sir GeraldC amp bell.

To:- Ministry of Aircraft Production.Prom:-    H.M. Consul General, Hew York.Received P.S.5.(Tels) 09U0 hours 29.6.UP.No. 15.MOST IMMEDIATE.Following for Rowlands from Self.     Begins.1.        Reference my telegram No. 190 18/6 Canadian Governmenthave urged strongly that allocations should be made to them on following lines from supplies due under French contractsnow assigned to United Kingdom.     They stress urgency oftheir requirements to meet not only Canadian defence needsbut also new Empire responsibilities undertaken by themin loaiand, Newfoundland and West Indies.     These latterinvolve widespread air patrols with fighter defence at bases,2.        For fighters they need 96 immediately US more by march 19UA.     They ask allocation of 96 from Hawks 75 A.Uspecified in my paragraph 6(D) and balance of h8 from Hawks81A h in my paragraph 8 (3).     They recognise that laterrequirements of h8 might be met by allocation fromHurricane production in Canaola if engines and equipmentare available in time.     Stress is laid on absence of anyfighters in Canada following recent release of availableaircraft to United Kingdom,3.        For twin-engined, bombers they need 88 over nextfew months and request allocation from Douglas D.B.7aircraft specified in my paragraph 6(?) and. DouglasD.B.7A aircraft in paragraph 8 (2).U,        For larger range patrols they need large numbersof P.B.Y. flying boats.     Production in Canada, -under licence planned but in the meantime they cannot functionwith less than the forty aircraft specified in myp ar agr aph 8 (k) *5*        For target towing and combat training under EmpireTraining Scheme they need at least 88 aircraft in lieu ofBattles not forthcoming from United Kingdom.     This needcould be met by allocation from 50 V 156 dive bombersspecified in my paragraph 8 (5) and 80 Northrop A.17 whichwe are pressing United States Government to release.Canada stress their needs as necessitating maximumallocation of V 156 type.6.        For advanced training they need 125 IT.A. 6I4. aircraftspecified in my paragraph 8 (6).      (Corrupt groups) 282Harvards.     Re-assembly of N.A.6lj. in United Kingdom would belengthy job as detailed drawings are not available.Moreover N.A.Ga is only suitable for training and has notbeen possible to operational use as with Harvards.     Canadacould take these aircraft into immediate use and trainingwould be as valuable there as in the United Kingdom.

7o        Of the other trainers they ask allocation of33 St ins on 105 type aircraft now lying at Halifax.     they need 72 to meet recent Royal Air Force requirements of 40hour flying training for wireless operators.8. Canada ask that their interest should he noted in ultimate allocation of four engined &quot;bombers specifiedin my paragraph two (a).9. Their interest LYSAITDERS is small and they wouldsurrender to United Kingdom outstanding deliveries of 92airframes if desired.10.       As regards surplus French engines Canada wishesspecial consideration to retention of engines in Canadauntil definite prospect of use in United Kingdom.Otherwise stocks may be locked up in United Kingdom throughdestruction of airframe production when airframes may be forthcoming in North American Continent but short of engines.11.       Canada ask immediately (? Pratt and Whitney)R.1530 engines specified in my paragraph 12(2) forinstallation in BOLINGBROKES now under construction and indefault of engine supplies from United Kingdom owing, they also need to allocate 360 during 1941 to meet continuingproduction of BOLINGBROKES from which they hope UnitedKingdom will take, share of deliveries.12.       Further allocation is required from capacity for producing R,1530 engines to meet need for 50 single rowWASP Junior engines late in 1940 to engine of Beechcrafttrainers013.       As production of P.B.Y. ? 24 develops in Canada upto 260 Pratt and Whitney I830 type engines specified in myparagraph 12 (3) will be required.14.       Instructions are requested as to allocations whichcan be made0     Armament end equipment problems will bediscussed with department of munitions and supply915o       Morris Wilson has seen and concurred.     He iscabling separately to Lord Beaverbrook.     Copy hereof isbeing sent to Sir G. Campbell and McKeane,     Ends.T. of 0. 0059 hours.Copies to:Minister.A.M.D.P.C.M.D.P.Secretary,D.A.CR.0.Mr. Slade.NOTE. Check and repeat of corrupt groups has been requested^

Aircon   No.paragraph 11. S/7/UO.United States Administration haveintimated a strong desire to Army Department totake over surplus engines from French orders and require us to justify prospective use in shipment to United Kingdom,     Purvis and I will endeavourto meet immediate enquiry hut we ask for urgentinformation to enable Army Department pressure tobe (?) declared.No, AIRMI U lh/7    -   paragraph 9.Reference paragraph 11 of Aircon Uij..Washington are insistent on immediate submission of detailed statement showing by types how andwhen surplus engines will be used.      They urgeUnited Kingdom airframe cannot utilize these supplies to full and press for release to them of balance with later replacement from UnitedStates Army orders as and when United Kingdomairframe production warrants.     Can you supplyurgently for Washington details to show how this surplus will be used to dovetail in with united Kingdom and Empire airframe production?

AMENDED DRAFT TELEGRAM.Following for Self from RowlandseParagraph 9 of AIR1VII 4 14/7 asks for detailed statement showing by types how and when surplus engines will be used.Recent changes in military situation dus to Frenchdefault have made increases imperative in the U.K. airframeprogramme,      Our own engine programme cannot possibly match theincreased airframe programme without these surplus engines whichare wanted as seen as they become available as follows:-1756 P. &amp; Wo R.  1830.580 for Beaufort:    deliveries to start October 1940to complete in September 1941.      The requirement ofthis engine for Beaufort may continue after thatdate0230 for Hudson as indicated in your telegram 190dated 18 June to Foreign Officee120 for Grumman as indicated in your telegram No. 51of 7th July,376 for Wellington:    deliveries to start October 1940and to complete February 1941.450 for Australian Beauforto770 P, &amp; Wo Ro 1555,All these are required for Master deliveries to commenceOctober 1940 and to complete August 1941.908 Po &amp; Wo R. 2800.These are not required but we do definitely want the1362 Po &amp; Wo 1830 which we understood we can have in exchange.     Please confirm that these P. &amp; W.1830 are available, when we will give allocation of engines to airframes.     Airscrews ordered for thePo &amp; W. 2800 can be cancelled.2950 Wright G.R. ,2600^1220 required for Stirling deliveries to commenceOctober 1940 and to complete June 1941.330 required for Albemarle:    deliveries to commenceApril 1941 and to complete August 1941.830 required for Beaufighters    deliveries to commenceOctober 1940 and to complete April 1941.570 required for Wellington:    deliveries to commenceAugust 1941 and to complete October 1941.All the Wright GoRo 2600 should be short nosed.55Q Alii sen V..,1710 *180 are allocated by you for the P.40 and P.46 asindicated in paragraph 13(g) of your 190 of 18th june and 300 for the Airacobra as indicated in your telegramNOo 4 of 26th June0     Remaining 70 required as sparesowing to doubtful quality of this engine and severeduties of the aircraft to which it is to be fitted.All dates given above are dates upon which the enginesshould arrive in England.     Deliveries should be in accordance withoriginal promises as otherwise later requirements of increasedairframe programme cannot be metD

Disappointments in regard to Taurus and Herculesonly make the position more acute.     Further we have not takeninto account possible interference with British engineoutput by enemy action.It is therefore imperative that you should use every endeavour to hold all these engines for us and have themdelivered at the dates given and especially earliestpossible delivery of sample engine with eqviipment asordered for trial installation.-S-
