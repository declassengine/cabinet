9 9 %TH!S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1940.SECRET. Copy No.     45W.P. (40) 313.August 11, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PRIORITY FOR TANKS.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.THE Minister of Aircraft Production has read the decisions taken at themeeting of the Production Council held on Monday, the 5th August, in regard toPriorities.To these decisions the Minister of Aircraft Production is strenuouslyopposed, and for the following reasons : 1. There is at present an acute shortage of many of the materials vital to theAircraft Industry. These materials include (a) Alloy steel bar and billets;(6) Steel forgings and stampings; (c) Solid-drawn steel tubes.The Ministry of Aircraft Production has to-day 1 A Priority in these materials. And if the figures for the production of aircraft are not seriously to fall in the weeks to come it is essential that this priority should be retained.2. (a) In spite of the priority it enjoys, the Ministry of Aircraft production is being forced, owing to the above shortages, to contemplate abandoning eitherBothas or Stirlings.(5) And as a further illustration of these shortages it must be stated thatthe firm of A. V. Roe and Co., who produce Blenheims, are threatened with thepossibility of having to shut down on their production owing to lack of dropstampings.3. Even under existing priority conditions it has been necessary to imposestrict limitations on the output of trainer aircraft. For instance, no seriousattempt is being made to increase the output of Masters and Battle trainers, bothof which are essential to the trainer programme of the Royal Air Force.4. If tank production is now to be granted equal priority in the materialsreferred to with aircraft production, it is obvious that a severe curtailment of allitems on this Ministry&apos;s programme must be undertaken at once. For it was admitted on all sides at the Meeting of the Production Council that to grant thisequality to tanks would seriously interfere with aircraft production.5. It is urged that the Ministry of Supply should put its own house in orderbefore there is any question of altering existing priorities. And particularly inregard to the following matters :-(a) Although the shortage of drop stampings interferes with the productionof aircraft, it is apparent that this is in part due to pressure put upon the industry by that section of consumers sharing with theMinistry of Aircraft Production the present priority advantages..For it is a fact that only 22-7 per cent, of the total output of drop&apos;stampings are being used by the aircraft industry, whereas 77-3 percent, are supplied to other production.[21628]
(b) As regards drop stampings the requirements of tank production can inany case be satisfied under the existing system of priority if theMinistry of Supply organises and directs the drop stamping industryso that it works to maximum capacity. The existing production canbe increased, according to Ministry of Supply officials themselves, byas much as 40 per cent.(c) If the Ministry of Supply gives internal priority for tank production:   at the top of their category 1 B, this will affect the position of wheeledvehicles, but will leave uninjured the far more essential position of aircraft. Interference will be confined to less vital production onlower levels of priority.(d) Alternatively, if the Ministry of Supply comb out their own 1Apriorities, they can reduce the production of motor vehicles for anti-aircraft equipment, which now ranks equally with aircraft production.6. In addition to stating these facts, it is necessary to utter a grave warningconcerning the present position of aircraft production. It is essential that therecent increase in production should not blind us to the seriousness of the existing situation.7. It has been necessary since the 15th May to increase the strength ofR.A.F. units by over 850 aircraft. And during that period 500 operational aircraft have been transferred to Training Stations.8. In the past three months we have shipped abroad to foreign. countries and the Dominions 160 aircraft.9. There is everywhere a shortage of spares. The squadrons stationed inFrance lost all their spares during the evacuation. These losses have still to bemade good.   To-day there are no spares in hand for the Repair Department.10. In the repair units there are at the moment 2,659 engines awaitingrepair. And in the past month there has been a falling off of repairs to bothairframes and engines. Last month the output of repaired engines was less thanthe total of damaged engines.11. There is an actual shortage of engines to-day. We are in a position where, for example, 106 Hampden airframes are waiting for the necessary212 Pegasus engines. And it is being found necessary, both with Hampdensand Wellingtons, to remove the engines after the planes have been ferried to the storage Units in order that the same engines shall be used to ferry the next batchof airframes.12. Casualties in the last seven days for categories 3 and 2 amounted to231 aircraft.* In some types casualties actually exceeded production. these losses, which, since the Ministry of Aircraft Production was set up, have exceeded2,310 machines, put the greatest possible strain on the productive capacity of theAircraft industry. 113.   As regards the future, we have to face the following facts : 14. Our reserves are declining. In the aircraft Storage Units there areto-day fewer airplanes ready than there were a month ago. And there are no indications that this state of affairs is improving.15.   At the same time our requirements are increasing :  .(a) The Empire and African training requirements up to the 31st December,1940, amount to 982 aircraft.(b) In the immediate future we shall have to send 100 fighters and bombers,as well as some Reconnaissance planes, to the Middle East.(c) I am told that it will be necessary to send at least 250 fighters andbombers, in addition to Reconnaissance planes, to the Far East.16. In conclusion, I am convinced that the needs of the Royal Air Force are so urgent that the outcome of the war will turn on the labours in the coming months of the aircraft industry.* There were no Tank casualties.
9 9 ^Ministry of Aircraft Production,August 11, 1940.In particular,, the result of the struggle in the air is going to depend on the rapidity with which we can produce the Sabre engine.17. Three plants will be engaged on this engine. They are short of machinetooling, of labour, and of material, especially alloy steel and light alloys. It isof the utmost importance that these deficiencies should be made good.18. All these facts lead me to reiterate most strongly my opposition to anychange in the existing system, whereby the Ministry of Aircraft Production wouldbe deprived of the priorities it now enjoys.If the proposals of the Production Council are adopted by the War Cabinet,a curtailment in the operational strength of the Royal Air Force must be carried into effect forthwith.BEAVERBROOK.
