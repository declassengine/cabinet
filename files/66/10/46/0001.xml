9 Q &amp;hi *3 WCypher telegram from Secretary of State to Governmentof India3  Defence Department, dated 3rd August,  19h0.TljPORTANT.SECRET.1. On the assumption that the Government of India would almost certainly be ashed to provide more troops for service overseas than the forces being prepared for NIBLICK and SABINEHis Majesty&apos;s Government were asked for a forecast of their probable requirements together with their proposals for the equipment for such forces as they might require.      They were also asked for their views as to the extent to which theprovision of these forces should take precedence overpreparations to assist Afghanistan and whether in any case such assistance should be restricted during present grave situation to the forward move to Jalalabad and Kandahar recommended inGovernment of India interim plan.2. Question has been examined by Chiefs of Staff who had before them Governor-General&apos;s personal telegram 1029/S June21st and Government of India telegram 11+53 June 26th andstatement of the equipment problem.3- Chiefs of Staff recommendations are  1-(a) Government of India should be asked to prepare andreplace for service overseas1 Infantry Brigade group by end of September.1 Infantry Brigade group in November.1 Motor Cavalry Brigade oy end of January,  1941*6 Infantry Brigade groups by May 19hl.If the Artillery and Ancillary troops for these brigade groupscannot be found,   the Infantry brigades should be preparedwithout them.      The field artillery regiment offered can beaccepted on a horsed basis.      If the provision of drivers andtechnical personnel presents no difficulty,  the first linetransport of all infantry brigades should be on M.T.  basis and early steps should be taken to provide the necessary vehicles.(b) In principle,  forces required to fight a first class enemyshould be equiijped to E.D.T.  scale.      Forces sent overseas tocarry out internal security or L.   of C.  duties or to a theatrewhere a first class enemy is unlikely to be met,  may be equipped to the highest scale which India herself can provide.His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake to provide allequipment required from United Kingdom or foreign sourcesup to full E.D.T.  scale and also to replace all such equipmentthat has already been supplied to forces overseas by India from her own stocks.      This should be completed by April?  19hl*  or as soon as possible after that date,  taking into account our responsibility in other parts of the v/orld.      Training scales of weapons (e.g. Mortars, A/T rifles, etc.) should be sent toIndia as and when such equipments become available.
(c) The Government of India should be informed that,   inaddition to forces already earmarked in India,  and the forcesmentioned in paragraph 3(a), His Majesty&apos;s Governmentanticipate having to request the preparation of further forcesamounting to three divisions,  the first by August,   19^4-lj andthe other two by the end of that year.(d) For the present, Middle East requirements should take precedence over all plans for assistance to Afghanistan.      inany case such assistance should be limited to the forward, move to Jalalabad - Kandahar.      It is recognised that the despatchof forces overseas from India must be dependent upon theretention in India of adequate forces for the defence  of theNorth West Frontier and for internal security.h. Chiefs of Staff stressed value of including artilleryunits in brigade groups if India could raise additional unitsrequired.      Mountain artillery in proportion of one regimentto two field regiments would be acceptable.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government have approved these recommendations and hope that you will be prepared to act on them.      If so,  you are authorised to start forthwith necessary preparations for forming the three divisions mentioned inparagraph 3(c) and to raise such units in replacement as maybe necessary in order to meet India&apos;s own defence requirements.6. I should be glad to know in due course extent to which you anticipate being able to meet His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s requirements and also what major units you anticipate having toraise in replacement under 3(a) and 3(c).
9 o 76 o* i telegram from Government of India, Defence Department, toSecretary of State for India dated 9th August 1940.2177/0._9/8Your telegram No,4427, August 3rd.   Before giving youdefinite answer to paragraph 6 of your telegram we have thefollowing general comments to make regarding His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s request.part I.    Paragraph No.1.   Apart from Niblick, the provis-ion oi further troops for overseas depends (a), on provisionof equipment from United Kingdom or foreign sources: (b),upon retention in all circumstances of adequate forces in-India for defence of the North-West Frontier and internal security: and (a)., the long-term policy to be adopted asregards preparations for the implementation of interim plan and for provision of units for Sabine.   As regards (b), weconsider it essential that we should have some modernised,forces for this purpose as.early as possible, but for the&quot;present we agree that requirements of Middle East should have priority.   As regards (c), if troops now ashed for are provided by us it will not be possible to carry out interimplan before the middle of 1941.   .As regards Sabine, we suggestthat this commitment requires re-examination as there appearsto be no division available to replace rtufus, not to mention the provision of remaining two divisions.    If we are to raisethese units as requested by you, it will-certainly interferewith provision of &quot;troops for overseas now as^ed for.   Althoughequipment for Sabine has been ordered as now authorised, wesuggest no action be ta^en to raise units at present.Part 2.   Paragraph 2.   Subject to above remarks, weconfirm that we can provide the forces as stated in Viceroy&apos;telegram 1029-S of June 21st, as amended by 1476-S of July22nd.   It is to be noted that neither of these referred tobrigade groups, repeat groups, and five of brigades were tobe on an animal transport, basis.   We would however makefollowing suggestions:-&apos;(a) that first&apos;two brigades with ancillary units be utilised to complete fourth Indian division and Rufus, if asseems probable a brigade of latter should be required toremain in Sudan.    (b) that instead of a horsed Field Kegimentwe should provide a mechanised Field feeglinent which can beready by December 1st.    (c) that instead of the remaining sixbrigades we should provide two divisions on an M.T. basis, thefirst ready by May 1941,;the second by July 1941.   Both wouldbe complete except that only one Field Kegiment would beavailable .for each division&apos;;    (d) that, if available,untrained British personnel, guns and tractors be sent toIndia in order to enable us to provide a second Field Kegimentfor each .of above two divisions.   The provision of MountainArtillery is impracticable as whole of our production of 3*7Inch howitzers is already earmarked for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and Mountain artillery personnel is being fully utilisedin our present expansion plans,   (e) a motor brigade can beprovided as promised but we would much prefer to utilise ittowards formation of armoured division referred to below.3.     Your request for 3 additional divisions can, in ouropinion, best be met by provision of one Armoured Division(details regarding which will be sent separately) and two infantry Divisions, all between August and December 1941,provided of course that necessary equipment is forthcoming.
Part 3,4.     As regards replacement.   Apart-from the troops required forfrontier defence and internal security, we regard the fluidarmy of mobile troops and mechanised infantry (? divisions,? brigades) now in process of formation under our expansionscheme to meet the Russian menace, as our basic total require-ment.   Our ultimate aim must be to maintain this field armyintact in India in addition to providing minor requirements from time to time.    In the meantime we,will, so far as conditiapermit, place formations taken from it at the disposal of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, subject to automatic replacement.5.     As regards equipment.   We will reply to your 4520 of July7th separately and will also telegraph summary of our mainrequirements on E.D.T. scale for the forces now offered, whichscale appears to us to be necessary for all their probablecommitments.6.     We will also telegraph approximate requirements of british personnel (officers and other ranks) in addition to those already asked for.7. A separate telegram respecting the financial arrangements will be sent to you in due course.Telegram from Government of India, Defence Department, toSecretary of State for India, dated 9th August 1940.2182Reference your 4520 dated 7th August 1940, and incontinuation of our 2177/C dated 9th August 1940. We fullyunderstand your situation but have some doubt if it is realised that we have now reached a situation in which we have no furtheequipment of home supply in India on which we can distrain, for preparation of forces for overseas. Until therefore we receiveequipment already indented for by us we cannot even complete oupresent expansion and all our offers are dependent on receiptnot only of this equipment but also of equipment for replacement of units and necessary reserves. We have no modernised units ifsight in India except those offered His Majesty&apos;s Government an!as far as we can foresee there will be no material improvementin this respect until the middle of 1941. We have already accepted as a temporary measure that Indian units on I.S. and.D. roles shall have no M.T. vehicles and in former case noL.M. guns. This of course is far below Chatfield recommend at-10ns. Our offers of troops are in fact worthless and misleadinunless His Majesty&apos;s Government can produce equipment which insome respects is more important than men. It is therefore of paramount importance that proposals of C.O.S. contained insecond part of paragraph&apos; No.3(b) of your telegram 4427 dated3rd August should, be implemented at the earliest possible date.
