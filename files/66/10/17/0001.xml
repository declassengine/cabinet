NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.COASTAL convoys and patrol and minesweeping forces have been constantlyattacked by enemy aircraft, particularly in the vicinity of Dover.There has been little U-boat activity.Minelaying by enemy aircraft has continued to increase in intensity.There has been a successful cruiser action in the Mediterranean.Home Waters.2. During the afternoon of the 18th July, H.M. trawlers and minesweepersoff the East and South coasts were attacked by enemy aircraft with bomb and machine guns. Little damage was done, but two trawlers suffered casualties.One aircraft was shot down by a trawler. The East Goodwin light vessel (notmanned) was bombed and sunk, and the Sunk light vessel was holed on thewaterline.3. In an enemy raid on Dover on the 19th July, H.M. Destroyer Beagle was heavily bombed and slightly damaged by near misses, and on the 20th July,-while on passage to Devonport she was again attacked off Portland, when further minor damage was caused. No casualties were sustained in these attacks, during which two of the attacking aircraft were shot down by pom-poms.In a dive bomber attack on Dover later on the 19th July, H.M. DestroyerGriffin was damaged and rendered unseaworthy, and the R.F.A. Oiler War Sepoyhad her back broken, necessitating the pumping out of her oil. On the same dayH.M. M/S Trawler Crestflower was sunk by bombs off St. Catherine&apos;s Point,Isle of Wight, and Motor A/S Boat No. 8 was attacked with machine-gun fireby enemy aircraft off Aldeburgh with the loss of two ratings killed and twoofficers and one rating wounded.During an attack by enemy aircraft on a convoy off Dover in the evening ofthe 20th July, H.M. Destroyer Brazen was hit and later sank while in tow.Three of her crew were wounded. She shot down three enemy aircraft beforesinking.4. On the 21st July H.M. Destroyers Vanoc and Havelock were in collisionin the Liverpool area. Vanoc was holed above the waterline, but Havelock wasonly slightly damaged.On the 22nd July H.M. Trawler Campina was mined and sunk off Holyhead.Three of her crew of thirteen were saved.Eight Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm attacked shipping in the local fjords nearBergen and one patrol vessel was sunk.5. Late on the 23rd July our aircraft sighted an enemy force consisting of8 destroyers and 6 camouflaged merchant vessels of 2,500 tons about 90 miles.S.W. of Lister Light steering North-West at 10 knots. Nine Skuas and torpedo-carrying Swordfish were sent to attack, and one of the Destroyers was hit by a torpedo from a Swordfish, but the Skuas failed to locate the enemy. Atthe time of the attack the enemy had altered course to the south-eastward.6. During the night of the 23rd/24th July 3 M.T.B.&apos;s from Dover, whileengaged in a sweep between Calais and Boulogne, attacked six enemy E-boats and damaged two of them. The same night four of H.M. Trawlers were bombed by aircraft, three being damaged.On the 24th July ELM. A/S Trawler Kingston Galena and H.M. M/STrawler Rodino were sunk by aircraft off Dover and two other trawlers were damaged. H.M. M/S Trawler Fleming was sunk by dive bombers eastward ofHarwich, 3 of her crew of 22 were rescued. H.M. M/S Trawler Berberis, whichwas in company at the time, destroyed one enemy plane and seriously damage done other. During the night the French ship Meknes, bound for Marseilles fromSouthampton with 100 French Naval officers, including Admiral Cayol, and1,186 ratings, who were being repatriated, ^was torpedoed off the Dorset coast,probably by an E-boat. She was showing illuminated distinguishing marks at thetime. About 1,000 survivors were picked up by destroyers sent from Portsmouthand the Western Approaches.
Mediterranean.7. Early in the morning of the 19th July H.M.S. Sydney with .M. Destroyers Hyperion, Hew, Havock, Hero and Hasty were engaged incarrying out a sweep between Greece and Crete in search of Italian shipping.A.t 0724 two Italian cruisers, the Bartolomeo Colleoni and another of the sameclass, probably the Giovanni Belle Bande Nere, were sighted by four of the destroyers in the Antikithera Channel, north-west of the western end of Crete.The destroyers retired to the north-eastward while H.M.S. Sydney, with .M. Destroyer Havock in company, closed to engage the enemy. As soon asSydney opened fire on the leading enemy cruiser, the Colleoni, our destroyersclosed in support, and the Italian cruisers endeavoured to escape back throughthe Antikithera Channel. Early in the action a hit by Sydney in Colleoni&apos;sengine room brought her to a standstill, and Sydney, leaving our destroyers tocomplete her destruction with torpedoes, continued the engagement with theother cruiser. The latter, however, succeeded in escaping after a chase lasting\\ hours, in the course of which she was hit several times by Sydney. a force sailed from Alexandria in an attempt to intercept her but was unsuccessful.545 survivors from the Colleoni were picked up by H.M.S. Havock, which was bombed by enemy aircraft while engaged in their rescue and had one boilerroom flooded, but was able to proceed without assistance.There were no casualties in H.M. ships in this action. The Captain of theColleoni died of wounds received in the action on the 23rd July at Alexandria.8. Following on the above action aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm attackedTobruk, where it was hoped the damaged cruiser might be found, early on the20th July. The ship was not in the port, but an oil tanker was hit and two othermerchant vessels probably damaged.H.M. Submarine Phoenix, which was operating off Sicily, is now presumed lost.,Other Foreign Stations.9. Following the report of an enemy raider in the Western Atlanticmentioned in last week&apos;s summary, our Naval forces in the zones affected havebeen disposed for purposes of interception. The raider, named Narvik, is a cargotype of 9,000 tons painted with Swedish colours with an armament of two5-9-inch guns, two 3-inch guns and several pom-poms and machine guns. The&quot;S.S. British Petrol of 6,891 tons was sunk on the 14th June in about the same position as S.S. Davisian which was sunk on the 13th July 400 miles north-west of Barbados.  No further activities of this raider have since been reported.On the evidence of ships known to be overdue it was believed that a secondraider might be operating in the Atlantic to the southward of Narvik&apos;s knownarea, but news received of the torpedoing of S.S. Sarita (5,824 tons) off Cape VerdeIslands on the 14th July opens up a possibility that the overdue ships may havebeen attacked by submarine.10. An intercepted report from the S.S. City of Bagdad (7,506 tons) statedthat she was shelled by a raider on the 11th July, about 550 miles south-eastwardof Ceylon. She left Lorenzo Marques on the 28th June and has been overdue atPenang since the 13th July. Nothing further has been heard of this raider, detailsof which are not known.The French liner He de France (43,450 tons) has been requisitioned at singapore, her future employment being under consideration. About one-thirdof her crew are expected to volunteer to serve under the British flag.Unsuccessful attacks were made by enemy aircraft on H.M.S. Hobart inthe Red Sea on the 21st July, and on H.M.S. Colombo on the 22nd July, off thesouth-east coast of Italian Somaliland.The first section of a troop convoy from Durban has arrived at Mombasa.French Fleet.11. The French warships in British waters have been divided into threewarn categories -. (a) ships to be manned entirely by French personnel under Admiral Muselier;.y) ships manned by 26 per cent. French and the remainder British personnel&apos;;(c) ships manned by Polish or Dutch personnel![-21557] B
In category (a) are the battleship Courbet, some ten A/S and M/S craft, including three ships fitted for magnetic mmesweeping, and the submarines Ruois andMinerve.   These ships will all be manned by the 25th July.In category (b) are the destroyer Leopard and some twenty-one other smallercraft.As regards category (c), the Polish Navy is undertaking the manning of the destroyer Oitragan, two sloops and two chasseurs. The Dutch Navy are under-taking the manning of three other French ships and A/S craft.Anti-Submarine Operations.Home.12. On the 20th July a promising attack was carried out by one of our aircraft 120 miles east of The Shetlands.Mediterranean.13. A delayed report has been received that on the 7th July H.M.S. Hastysighted a U-boat on the surface 100 miles north-west of Alexandria. The conningtower of the U-boat passed close down the side of Hasty as the depth chargeattack was carried out. Subsequently there was a strong smell of oil, and fiveminutes later four heavy underwater explosions were heard. On the next morningHasty attacked a good contact about 3 miles away from her previous attack.Both these attacks are considered successful.On the 19th July H.M. A/S Vessel Beryl made a promising attack on aU-boat 4 miles off Malta.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.14. During the week enemy aircraft have persistently attacked convoys inthe Channel and on the East coast. On the morning of the 18th a south-bound convoy was unsuccessfully attacked off Orfordness, and on the same afternoon3 convoys were attacked off Buchan Ness without inflicting damage. On the20th the west-bound channel convoy was attacked near Dover, resulting in theloss of one British ship (960 tons) and damage to another. On the 21st the sameconvoy was repeatedly attacked off the South coast; one British ship (2,318 tons)was sunk and two Norwegian tankers damaged, one of which was set on fire and:eventually beached. %     &apos;15. On the 22nd, 23rd and 24th further unsuccessful attacks on convoyswere made along the south and east coasts, and on the 25th the west-boundchannel convoy was heavily attacked off Dover and Sandgate, resulting inconsiderable damage, the details of which will be included in the Summary next week.U-boat activity has been slight; four British ships (13,236 tons) have been sunk, and a delayed report has been received that the Norwegian tanker Sarita(5,824 tons) was torpedoed and sunk on the 14th July in the vicinity of the cape verde Islands. One British ship (4,886 tons) was mined and sunk off Belfast andanother (305 tons) in the Liverpool approaches.Details of shipping losses are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. 1,051 ships, including 108 Allied and 42 Neutral, were convoyed duringthe week, of which three ships were lost by enemy action. Nine armed merchant cruisers, 25 destroyers, 17 sloops and 12 corvettes were employed on escort duties.Total losses in convoy since the commencement of hostilities are 46 British,8 Allied, 4 Neutral, making a total of 58 ships out of 29,008 convoyed.17. Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the 20th July totalled 808,688 tons as compared with 983,320 tons during the.previous week. Mineral imports were 249,849 tons, an increase of 37,312 tons. Ofthis amount 170,141 tons were steel, scrap iron and iron ore. There were 4,000tons of aluminium and 4,000 tons of bauxite. Five tankers brought 47,852 tonsof oil. Cereal imports were 179,080 tons (16 ships were fully loaded withgrain), an increase over the previous week of 41,058 tons. Other food importstotalled 75,678 tons, of which 26,647 tons were refrigerated and tinned meats;
bacon and hams, 18,297 tons were sugar and 3,271 tons were fresh, dried andtinned fruit. Wine imports totalled 1,808 tons, of which 829 were from portugal and 736 were from South Africa. Other imports included large quantities of timber, wood pulp, wool, hides and jute.Enemy Intelligence.18. The battle-cruiser Gneisenau is reported to have left Trondheim on the20th July. Later, air reconnaissances showed two cruisers and one destroyer orlight cruiser there on the 22nd, and one cruiser and four destroyers on the24th July. On the night of the 19th/20th July the battleship Tirpitz and the admiral von Scheer were at Wilhelmshaven, and on the 21st July the battleshipBismarck at Hamburg. The former Dutch gunnery training ship Sourabaya has left Ymuiden and is now in Schillig Roads. E-boats have been reported offWorthing, North Foreland, Isle of Wight and Start Point, and also offTerschelling, Nieuport, Dieppe and Gris Nez.During the week two U-boats have been operating in the Western approaches and possibly one in the N.W. Approaches and another off Sogne Fjord on theNorwegian coast. On the 14th July a U-boat (German or Italian) was knownto be operating south of Cape Verde Islands.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.19. A photographic reconnaissance of Hamburg on the 21st July showed the liners Bremen (51,731 tons), and Europa (49,746 tons), in the process of beingcamouflaged. Extensive alterations were being made to the appearance of theirupperworks.A press report from Mexico City states that a 9,000 tons German ship has arrived in a Mexican port from Santa Elena, Costa Rica. This may be theWeser (9,179 tons) which sailed from Punta Arenas, Costa Rica, on the 11th july and was reported to be bound for Manzanilla.A German ship was sighted by a British tanker in position 80 miles south-west of the Canary Islands on the 20th July. This may be the Rekum(5,540 tons) which sailed from Teneriffe on the 17th July with 8,000 tons of oil.Italian.20. Efforts are being made to transfer the cargo of the Arabia (5,943 tons),which is at Assab, to a neutral ship which will take it to the Persian Gulf.The cargo includes ammunition which is believed to be of German origin.It is reported from Shanghai that three Italian merchantmen intend to sailfor Japan under Japanese colours. Orders have been given that they are to beintercepted.Two Italian ships which are at Buenos Aires are reported to be going upthe river to San Nicolas to lay up.British Minelaying.21.   A minefield has now been laid off the north-west coast of Scotland.On the 21st July 130 moored magnetic mines were added to the southernend of the east coast barrier and on the 24th July this barrier was extendedseaward by the addition of 250 mines. Minelaying by aircraft in German watershas continued.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.22. During the period under review mining activities of enemy aircraft have been intensified. Swansea, Mil ford Haven, Fishguard, Belfast, -Liverpool,Holyhead, Preston, Workington, Maryport, Silloth and the Kyles of Bute onthe west coast; Falmouth, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Newhaven and Dover ;on thesouth coast; and Humber, Tyne, Blyth and Rosyth on the east coast have all[21557] &quot; B 2
been closed for short periods. On the 25th July the Tyne-Blyth inshore channel,Newhaven, Milford Haven, Fishguard, Maryport, Silloth, Workington and Kylesof Bute were still closed.23. Plymouth has been fairly heavily mined this week. LL sweeps haveexploded 15 mines, and the Skid 1 mine. It is known that there are more in the sound and outside the harbour.In the Bristol Channel mine-destructor ships have exploded 2 mines nearFlatholm and 1 off Swansea, and LL sweeps have exploded 14 at Milford Havenand 3 off Swansea.In the Crosby Channel, Liverpool, LL sweeps exploded 8 mines, while2 out of 3 mines which were visible at low water have been recovered by theVernon Mine Recovery party.Five mines have been exploded by the LL sweep in the Firth of Forth, buta dangerous area has been declared as more mines have been seen to drop.LL sweeps have also exploded 3 mines in the Tongue area, 5 in the Tyne area,4 in the Humber, 7 in the Downs Channel and off Dover, and 3 in the NeedlesChannel. One of those swept in the Tyne had been dropped on the 7th July andswept over daily by LL sweep; it was finally exploded on the 20th July by a singleLL, having had thirteen days&apos; delayed action.24. Mine-destructor ships exploded 2 mines in Loch Ewe, 1 in Barrow Deepand 2 in the Clyde area, thus bringing their total to 41.The LL sweeps have this week accounted for 68 mines, and the LL totalhas now reached 267.The total of magnetic mines exploded or recovered is now 438, and themoored mine total is 434.An attempt appears to have been made to mine the Upper Dart, for a parachute mine exploded in a field near Widdecombe-in-the-Moor. The remains of the parachute and casing of the mine are in the hands of the police.Mine-destructor ship Andelle and coil drifters have searched the East and west Kyles of Bute without result.   The Kyles are, however, still closed.The Tree-class Oropesa trawlers are to be fitted out, manned and trained toprovide mine-sweeping protection for the slow English Channel convoys. six of these ships will have Norwegian officers as First Lieutenants,MILITARY SITUATION.United Kingdom.25. Eight regular battalions from India arrived in England on the17th July.Germany.26. There are indications that many fresh German troops are arriving in holland; and that Belgium, especially Brussels, is full of troops, of which a high proportion belong to the Air Force.Italy.27. The military situation in Italy remains obscure. On the Italo-Yugoslavfrontier there is still a concentration of some 15 to 16 divisions, which isprobably adequate for an offensive against Yugoslavia.Middle East.Egypt.28. Our policy of limited offensives in the Western Desert is being continued. In a successful action on the 18th July our armoured forces attackedan Italian column near Fort Capuzzo and destroyed 5 field guns, 3 anti-tank gunsand 12 lorries.
Libya.29. The first indications of the eastward movement of an Italian formationfrom Tripolitania to Cirenaica have been received. As far as is known, a largegarrison is still being maintained in Western Libya, and it is considered probablethat the Italian authorities remain uneasy about the attitude of the French in tunisia and Algeria. Italian efforts to relieve the garrison of Fort Capuzzocontinue. If the water pipe-line between Bardia and Fort Capuzzo is still outof action the situation of the garrison is probably becoming difficult.Somaliland.30. Patrols of the Somaliland Camel Corps have been active, and enemyposts at Farenji, Walid Hor and Qoljeit have been successfully attacked.The Balkan States.31. Partial demobilisation of the Hungarian Army is reported to have beenbegun at the instance of Germany on about the 18th July, 1940. Such demobilisa-tion as has occurred, however, appears to be of a temporary nature in order toprovide labour for the harvest.32. In Roumania, during the Russian invasion of Bessarabia and NorthernBukovina, about 100,000 men deserted from the army. During the past weeksome 200,000 men have been demobilised. The number of men with the coloursis now believed to be about 1,000,000.U.S.S.R.33. The military occupation of the Baltic States appears to have beencompleted. The forces apparently allotted for the defence of the Baltic states are divided into three armies and comprise an estimated maximum of twentyinfantry divisions, seven cavalry divisions and ten mechanised brigades.Far East.34. Recent Japanese naval and military activities have been primarily directed to closing the remaining supply routes open to Chiang Kai-shek. The Ningpomerchants have, however, successfully used their influence to have Japanese troopswithdrawn from the vicinity of Ningpo, and this route of supply is presumablystill open.AIR SITUATION.General Review.35. Weather has again interfered with operations throughout the week.The activity of our day-bombers has been severely restricted, though extensiveoperations have been possible at night and have been governed by the same policy as those of last week, apparently with considerable success. Fighter operations have increased in intensity and have produced satisfactory results.36. The scale of air attack on this country has again tended to decreaseduring the week and has almost exclusively consisted of attacks on convoys by large mixed formations of bombers and fighters. These attacks were not alwaysdeveloped or pressed home. Enemy reconnaissance and mine-laying operations have been at a high level and his transport aircraft have again been busythroughout the week.37. Operations in the Middle East have been of a similar character tothose of last week.Great Britain.38. The enemy&apos;s attacks &apos; this week have been chiefly directed againstsnipping, principally in the Channel and off the South-East Coast. The largetonnations engaged in these operations have assembled off the French Coast,and on many occasions have turned away on the approach of our fighters.   Even
when in sight of the convoys they have shown marked disinclination to launch a determined attack in the face of opposition. Most days have been cloudy,and so favourable to the enemy both in attack and evasion.39. Dover Harbour was attacked by dive-bombers escorted by fighters onthe 20th July, but little damage was done as the raid was intercepted by our fighters. On this occasion the enemy used for the first time the JaguarMesserschmitt dive-bomber, and one or possibly two were shot down. this aircraft is an adaptation of the Me. 110 twin-engined fighter, and carries a bomb load equivalent to that carried by our Blenheims. Later the same daytwo hostile formations of over 20 aircraft each approached Dover from Calais,but turned away on sighting our fighters. One of these formations, however,launched a quick attack on a convoy, and suffered two certain and six probablecasualties.40. On the 24th July an enemy force of about 50 aircraft was interceptedoff Deal by three of our fighter squadrons. In the combat which ensued the enemysuffered heavy losses, nine confirmed and sixteen unconfirmed, at the hands ofour fighters, who lost two Spitfires. During the morning of the 25th July, aboutfifty enemy aircraft in two formations were intercepted in the Portland area by three squadrons of our fighters Which shot down six of the enemy with theloss of one Spitfire.41. Daylight attacks and reconnaissances, usually by single aircraft, have continued throughout the week, but no serious damage has resulted. Most ofthe attacks have developed from the South-West and North-East, though afew raids have crossed the East Coast. The Plymouth and Glasgowdistricts have . received the most attention and many aerodromes have been bombed but no major damage was done. The Royal Ordnance factories atGlasgow and Pembrey (South Wales) were also bombed with negligible results.Six German prisoners were killed and eighteen injured by bombs dropped nearBanff on the 22nd July. On the 21st July an M.E. 110 on photographic recon-naissance shot down one of our training aircraft near Salisbury, but was subse-quently shot down by fighters near Goodwood.42. Enemy reconnaissance aircraft have been particularly active and their operations appear to be directed at observation of all shipping in the north sea, Channel and Western Approaches, and watching our aerodromes. Mine-laying has taken place every night during the period under review, extendingas far north as Aberdeen and the Clyde. Other night attacks have been on a smaller scale than recently, but bombs were dropped in widely separated areaswithout doing any damage of importance.43. Enemy losses during the week were 59 confirmed and 44 unconfirmed.Five of these casualties were inflicted at night. Our losses were 26 fighters. the casulties due to enemy bombing during the week were 33 killed and 206 injured.Germany and German-Occupied Territory.44. Daylight operations by our Blenheims have been drastically curtailedduring the week by unsuitable weather conditions. Aerodromes in France and holland, a railway junction near Dortmund, and barges near the Hague were attacked, but results were difficult to assess.45. Our night bombers have been active throughout the week, and except on the 24th July attacks on a heavy scale, involving up to a hundred aircraft,have been made every night on a variety of targets in German-occupied territory.On the night of the 24th/25th July only twenty-five aircraft were despatchedowing to unfavourable weather. Battle and Blenheim medium bombers, as wellas Hudsons of the Coastal Command, have taken part in these operations. these have inflicted severe damage on petroleum installations in Holland and Belgium,and on aerodromes in Northern France.46. In Germany our attacks have been concentrated on aircraft factories,oil plants and railway targets. Very large fires and explosions were caused inthe oil plants at Bremen, Hamburg and Gelsenkirchen, at the last named on three consecutive nights.    Equally satisfactory results were secured at the
aircraft factories. At the Focke-Wulf factory at Bremen and the FieselerFactory at Kassel direct hits were made, resulting in heavy explosions, while atthe Cornier airframe factory at Wismar, which was bombed by seventeenaircraft, later arrivals reported that buildings had been burnt out and only largesmouldering fires could be seen. Eighteen aircraft attacked aircraft stores atRotenburg and Gottingen, obtaining many hits on buildings and hangars. on two occasions Wilhelmshaven Dockyard was attacked, and, though no positiveresults were observed, due to searchlight activity, a 2,000-lb. bomb fell very near the Admiral Scheer. Heavy explosions were caused on several nights in the marshalling yards at Soest and Hamm, and a heavy bomb was observed to fallin a bottleneck leading to the latter. Weather conditions were not alwaysfavourable, and clouds often obscured the primary target area, or prevented theobservation of results. Aircraft which failed to locate their targets in Germanydropped many bombs with good effect on aerodromes in Holland.47. In addition to these operations, mines were successfully laid in theBaltic and along the Dutch and German coasts both by our heavy bombers andby Swordfish Aircraft operating under Coastal Command. Leaflets were distributed over wide areas in Northern France.48. Night fighters have been used by the enemy for the first time on any considerable scale, and standing patrols of Me. 110&apos;s are now maintained overthe Low Countries. Our bombers shot dowTn one enemy fighter, confirmed, and six unconfirmed.  During the week Bomber Command lost eighteen aircraft.&apos;North Sea and Coastal.49. Coastal Command aircraft have been engaged continuously during theweek in reconnaissance, standing patrols and convoy escort duties. The Dutch,Belgian and North-West French coasts have been patrolled day and night, and special reconnaissance flights have been made to Stavanger, into the Skagerrak,and as far south as Bordeaux. On the 19th July an aircraft on patrol reportedan enemy force of two cruisers and six destroyers in the Skagerrak, which was attacked later, without apparent results, by a striking force of nine Hudsons.The wireless station at Utsire on the Norwegian coast was bombed by a Hudson,which resulted in the collapse of the mast and severe damage to the stationbuildings. During the week two enemy aircraft were shot down, while our losses amounted to ten, two of which occurred on the 21st July during an attack byseven Hudsons on a convoy of one large and five small ships, 30 miles off the ListerLight; the large ship received two direct hits.50. An enemy submarine was bombed and probably sunk by a patrollingHudson in the Bergen area on the night of the 20th/21st July, and on the evening of the 24th July another submarine was bombed 80 miles east of the Shetlands, and though hits are claimed, its destruction is not certain.German attacks on our shipping and other enemy operations in Britishcoastal waters have already been described.Middle East and Mediterranean.Gibraltar.51. An attack was made by four enemy aircraft on the 18th July and bombsfell in the Catchment area.   There was no other damage and no casualties.Malta.52. Enemy aircraft flew over the Island on the 19th July and attacks onKalafrana were made on the 21st, one bomber being destroyed by A.A. fire. Minorattacks were renewed in the early morning of the 24th, but little damage was done. On the 23rd July a Sunderland attacked a convoy of six ships off CapeSpartivento. It is believed that two direct hits were registered, and only four of the six convoyed ships were subsequently observed in Augusta. A monoplanefighter is believed to have been shot down by a Sunderland on patrol in the same area on the 24th July.
Palestine.53. Eight aircraft raided Haifa on the morning of the 24th July and didserious damage to the Shell installations; about thirty-five civilians were killed.Egypt.54. Attacks have been concentrated on Tobruk, El Gubbi and Bardia. AtTobruk hits were scored on the submarine jetty and on a merchant vessel. A fleet air Arm attack on Tobruk has already been described. Transport columns and stores were successfully attacked in the Bardia district, and large fires were started at El Gubbi. In these operations we lost one Gladiator. On the 24th Julypart of an ammunition dump near Bardia was blown up by our bombers, and the six escorting Gladiators shot down without loss four and probably five of the eighteen enemy fighters encountered. On the following day a concentration of enemy aircraft at Derna (between Benghazi and Tobruk) was severely damaged,and on the return journey five out of seven enemy aircraft encountered were shot down into the sea. by five Gladiators without loss. Enemy attacks were directed at Mersa Matruh, which was bombed on five days, and on other aerodromes and landing grounds in Western Egypt.  No serious damage was done.Sudan and East Africa.55. Our bombers operating from the Sudan and Aden, and units of theSouth African and Rhodesian Air Forces operating from Kenya, have carriedout successful attacks on aerodromes and fuel stores in Italian East Africa. Ourreconnaissance aircraft have also been active and have attacked native troops andtransport columns.  Enemy air attacks have been light and ineffective.German Air Intelligence.56. Losses. From the 3rd September to the 23rd July inclusive the losses are 2,903 confirmed. From the 1st July the losses are 174 confirmed and120 unconfirmed.Italian Air Intelligence.57. Operation of Fighters. It is particularly significant that during19 Royal Air Force night raids over Italian Territory, including Libya andItalian East Africa, no fighter opposition has been encountered. This confirmsinformation received as to the complete lack of night-flying training in fighter squadrons.The weakness of Italian air defence in East Africa is indicated by the factthat, with the exception of five at Addis Ababa, all the remaining thirty-fourfighters are concentrated in Northern Eritrea, opposite Aden and the Sudan, andin Eastern Abyssinia, opposite British Somaliland. These concentrations, whichleave Southern Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland completely undefended by fighter aircraft, have evidently been necessitated by the constant raids carried outby the Royal Air Force on Massawa, Gura, Assab and Agordat in the North, andon Diredawa and Jigjiga in the East.58. Italian East Africa. The Italian aircraft strength in Abyssinia,Eritrea and Italian Somaliland is now believed to consist of 131 bombers (90 ofwhich are obsolete), 40 fighters and 10 reconnaissance aircraft.59. Dodecanese. The reinforcement of the Dodecanese by 30 S. 79 bombershas now been completed by the arrival of the final 15 at Rhodes on the 15th July.These aircraft comprise the 12th Stormo, which is a &quot; star &quot; formation and isknown as the &quot; Green Mice &quot; Stormo.60. Sabotage. A number of unexplained explosions have occurred in theFiume-Trieste district. It is considered that these may be acts of sabotagecarried out by the Slovene or Austrian population. The damage is being officiallyattributed to Royal Air Force raids, but no air action has, in fact, taken placeover this area.61. Losses. During the week ending the 23rd July Italian losses werethirteen confirmed, two unconfirmed and four damaged, bringing the total to 175(113 confirmed, 28 unconfirmed and 34 damaged).
Russia.62. Transport of Tanks by Air. During the occupation of Bessarabia,transport aircraft transported a small number of T. 37 tanks, motor cycles and light guns. The tanks, one per aircraft, were transported by being slung betweenthe undercarriage struts of T.B. 3 aircraft. The weight of the tank, including all the fastening devices was about 3 tons. The tank&apos;s crew of two men wasalso transported in. the aircraft.Japan.63. Large Purchases of Lubricating Oil. In addition to the large purchases of aviation petrol reported in last week&apos;s summary, the Japanese army has nowplaced an order for some 7^ million gallons (American) of aircraft lubricating oil.This amount is approximately equivalent to a four to five years&apos; supply as estimated on the average expenditure of the last two to three years. This order,together with the large further orders for aviation petrol given in mid-July denotean urgent need in Japan for ample reserves of these commodities. It has beensuggested that this unusually large order for lubricating oil may not beunconnected with Germany&apos;s known lack of this commodity. It must beremembered a new Cabinet has arisen, amongst whose aims is reported a strengthening of relations with the Axis Powers. A more probable reason,however, is to obtain reserves in case of hostilities in the Far East involving an american embargo on export of oil to Japan.[21557]c
