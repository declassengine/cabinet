2. Meknes Survivors.Following on the Prime Minister&apos;s desire that the survivors of the Meknesshould be treated as well as possible and that the opportunity should be taken of informing Frenchmen of the treatment they may expect at the hands of theGermans, the following action was taken : (a) Officers and men were sent to the naval training establishments atFareham, Trevol and Skegness, where they were given rest andcomfort and kitted up.(b) Admiral Muselier was given every facility to address the Officers andMen and he was accompanied by a British Naval Liaison Officer at each place, who also spoke to the Officers and Men.(c) The Ministry of Information was asked to produce Posters giving thefacts attending the sinking of the Meknes and also daily News Sheetsin French. They have also arranged for suitable people to visit the establishments to undertake welfare work and chat with the men.3. Admiral Muselier&apos;s visit has, so far, been unproductive. He was coollyreceived by the French Officers. His speech to the men did not appear to have much effect one way or the other. The men said, as they have always said, thattheir one desire ivas to return to France and see their families.The remarks of the British Naval Officer who visited Skegness, where thegreater number of the survivors were established, were to the following effect: -(a) French Officers and Men say that they have been very well treated andthat they are most grateful, and that their relations with the british officers and Men in charge of their welfare are extremely friendly.They are obviously impressed by the smartness and efficiency of the camp and by the Ceremonies of Divisions, prayers, hoistingcolours, &amp;c, which they attend.(b) They consider that they were much less well treated at Liverpool, exceptin the matter of leave. A small minority would prefer to be at liverpool to see girl friends and the other Sailors.(c) The men seem to have a poor opinion of their Officers.   They say that theOfficers were first away in the boats.(d) Much gratitude was expressed towards the ships who picked up the survivors of the Meknes.The British Naval Officer again emphasises the preoccupation of the menabout their families. They seem to have little idea of the present situation of France, and imagine that they will be able to find and succour their familiesif only they can get there. Many would gladly stay and work in England ifsafety of family was assured. It seems to be expected that we shall win thewar and that France will rise again, but, in the meantime, their duty is to their wives and children.There seems to be no ill-feeling towards the men who have joined the british navy.  They are believed to be mostly bachelors.Our pamphlet on conditions of service has been carefully studied, and asmall minority is thinking of joining us.So far no Officers or Men of the Meknes survivors have volunteered to join the Royal Navy or General de Gaulle.4. Aintree Camps.The work of improving conditions there by the Admiralty is being continued.Posters and News Sheets from the Ministry of Information have beendistributed.

Fifty Poles are working for the Forestry Commission.(f) Security. As a result of the visit of representatives of M.I. 5 and twosenior officers of the corresponding Polish Service, matters in the Polish Area inScotland have been placed on a satisfactory basis.
