I^YprinnUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 2DHET.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR    CABINET.bjjh.0) 27U. RELATIONS WITH EIRE. Copy NoMemorandum by the g^cj^tagy, of.. State for Dominion Affairs.I think it necessary to draw the attention of theWar Cabinet to reports which I have received fromSir John Maffey, the United Kingdom Representative to Eire, on .the subject of our relations with the Government of Eire.      Iappend the latest of these, being the account of a talk whichhe had with Mr, dc Yaler-a on July 17th.Sir John Kaf:.;:v;y reports that since the Minister ofHealth visited Dublin and presented.to Mr. de Valera our plan &apos;for the Eire Government&apos;s co-operating with us in the war(W.P.(40)233) and the rejection of that plan by the Government of eire (W.P.(U0)251), there has been a change for the worse in thegeneral atmosphere, as shown by the increase of suspicion on thepart of the Government of Eire and in Eire generally with regardto our intentions.     The impression which has now developed in eire is that our policy Is to get Eire into the war on our side and that, failing that, we are prepared to occupy the territory of eire by force,      This feeling Inevitably increases the difficultyof securing the help of .the Government of Eire in making suchpreparations, as are possible while Eire is neutral, against aGerman invasicn.This change of opinion has developed suddenly.It is due, in Sir John Maffey!s opinion, mainly to three causes:-(i) The feeling, however ill-founded, that having putforward an offer which has been declined we are nowshowing signs of pique and hostility.      In thisconnection Lord Craigavon&apos;s statements expressingsatisfaction after his return from London have beennoted by the Eire Government.(ii) The refusal to help, with the supply of munitionswhich the rejected plan showed we were able and willing to supply if the Eire Government had agreedto let our troops enter Eire.(iii) The publication in the press of articles in whichcomments have been made on the folly of Eire&apos;sneutrality.     The Eire authorities regard thisactivity in the Press as propaganda inspired by theUnited Kingdom Government to bring pressure to bearon Eire to abandon her neutrality.     The fact thatthe alleged propaganda has not been restricted toPress articles in this country, but has extended to&apos;broadcasts and Press messages sent by United Statespress men in London to the United States hasincreased the irritation.Other
Other incidents, into the details of which I need not enter, have combined to produce the belief not only in Governmentcircles &quot;but among the population of Sire generally, including those most sympathetic to usf that we are meditating an invasion of Eire.I entirely agree with the view that the attitude ofthe Eire Government, in their rigid insistence on their policyof neutrality, is shortsighted and dangerous, both to themselves and to us, and their suspicions are exasperating beyond words.At the same time, the existence of these suspicions is a fact which we must face, and unless we are prepared to take the drasticstep of seizing their territory by force with the certainty of armed opposition on their part and all the incalculableconsequences which that would involve, the right course is to try to restore the better atmosphere which had been graduallybrought about.     As things now are, it seems to me that we arein grave danger not merely of not obtaining the participation of Eire in the war, but of losing such measure of friendlyco-operation as the Government of Eire are prepared to afford,and have of late, until quite recently, afforded to us.      Inparticular, we might even jeopardise the secret understanding with them that in the event of a serious invasion they willresist the enemy and call upon us for aid.In order to remedy this situation, there are three possible steps which would, I consider, be of great value:-(l) We should endeavour to damp down the Press campaignhere which is seriously, however unreasonably, disturbingrelations &quot;between this country and Eire.    I have alreadybeen in touch with the Minister of Information on this,and he tells me that he has spoken to the various Pressrepresentatives on the subject on the line that the Presshave fully ventilated the question and that the soft pedalmight now reasonably be applied.     The Press have had agood run for some weeks, and I hope they will respond tothis hint.(2) A suggestion to which both Sir John Maffey himself and many friendly unofficial correspondents from Eire attach great importance is that a public declaration on the subjectof invasion should be made &quot;by the United Kingdom Governmenton the highest authority.     The form of this statement which sir John Maffey advises and which I should like to see made,is that we have no intention of sending our forces into Eirewithout a request from the Government of Eire.     the objection that may be made to an explicit declaration of thiskind, though it is not intended to be a guarantee, is thatif a serious German invasion took place and no request forour help came from the Government of Eire, the United KingdomGovernment would be obliged, notwithstanding the declaration,to go in and meet the invasion of Eire.     My feeling about this objection is that in the circumstances I have supposedthe United Kingdom Government would be fully justified in sucha course.     I think, however, that it is certain that a request for help would come from Sire.   Mr. de Valera hastold Sir John Maffey that they would fight the Germans, andthere is evidence that this represents the general attitude in Sire.     He would in that event want our help.      I suggestthat such a statement, if made, should be given by thePrime Minister in reply to a question in the House of Commons.
(3) A practical measure which, in Sir John Maffey&apos;opinion, confirmed &quot;by his recent conversation with.Mr. de Valera, would go further than anything to dispelthe atmosphere of suspicion which has grown up, would bea more forthcoming attitude on our part towards thesupply of munitions to Eire.      In the plan which we put before the Eire Government one of the proposals was the supply of a considerable quantity of equipment of various kinds.     We were prepared to release the seat that time on the understanding that Eire&apos;s immediateparticipation in the war, to trie extent at any rate of allowing our troops to take up positions in Eire, wouldbe secured.      Admittedly, we cannot now secure this,and my present proposal is obviously less satisfactory.It is clear, however, that provided we can remove thepresent feeling of suspicion, they will do their best to resist any German invasion and will call upon us for our aid.      In order to confirm their resolution and to secure that in such circumstances their resistanceshould be as effective as possible, I suggest that it isworth our while to release to them now at least asubstantial proportion of the munitions, etc., which wewere prepared to offer to them as part of the plan.We know that they are in desperate need of supplies. &apos;By providing them we should go a long way towards makingEire a friendly non-belligerent who would in case of invasion develop into an active ally.      In some respectsat any rate it should be easier for us now to spare this material than a month ago when -the plan was put forward.I should therefore  like to have the authority.of theCabinet to offer to the Eire Government such equipment, notexceeding that proposed in the plan, as may be agreed with,the Service Departments.[UNIONS OFFICE, c-bh July, 19^0. -3-

it 9ANNEX    II had a long talk with Mr.de Valera this morning.He wished to speak to me about the deterioration in the relationship between his country and mine and to discuss with me ways and means of getting hack to the status quo ante.I told him that I was most conscious of the deterioration andhad reported it to my Government, and added that I should be grateful if he would tell me the symptoms of it as he saw themand the causes as he diagnosed them.He began by saying that one cause was inherent in thenature of war and nobody could be blamed for it.   We were engaged in a grim struggle which looked like getting grimmer.Our need might be such that we would at all costs seek to havethe use of air bases and ports in Eire.    The course of war was unpredictable.   Who would have guessed three months agothat the British would attack the French Fleet?   We agreed onthis point.The next cause he mentioned was p.ress propagandaattacking and criticising Eire for her neutrality.    There was such a wave of this that it suggested permission or connivance.America had come in on the same note.    I said that. American opinion seemed spontaneously to have decided that Eire ?/asblind to the fate of other neutral countries.   He said thatin Eire all this had been taken as British propaganda implyingstronger measures to follow.    In America important    sectionsof the Irish community who had always been unfriendly to him personally had smelt a danger and had rallied to his support.This was significant.Of course, there were other more subtle causes allcombining to give the impression that we were almost eagerfor the Germans to come in so that we could get in ourselves.Talk of a military &quot;pact&quot; had been published and had donegreat harm.   He begged that our military and staff liaisonshould be kept as secret as possible.    This was in our best interests.There seemed to be a real danger that our forces mightmove prematurely - a step which would spell disaster.   Whenthe MacDonald conversations failed there was a feeling here that there was some resentment on our side.   Craigavon&apos;sutterances had not been helpful.   He referred in this connec-tion to the case of Major Byass., the British Officer from theNorth, who had been engaged in some form of espionage in Eire.The staff work of his Army in recent years had been directed at meeting an attack from us.   With the outbreak ofwar they had switched over completely to plans for defeatingaggression by Germany.   He was bound to tell me that he had recently told the General Staff by no means to exclude theearlier possibility.    In fact, he was not exaggerating whenhe told me that expectation of invasion by us was now far more general than expectation of any other alternative.    TheByass affair was a source of much perturbation among his army officers.     They said: &quot;We have shown these peopleeverything.     We have revealed our plans-.     But there is something more they want.     What are we to think?&quot;.Naturally
Naturally I brought down the Byass incident to its properlevel - Mr. de Valera would not exaggerate its significance..- and then read out the tolograti from the Secretary of State of 16thJuly,. No.  106-*This had a tremendous effect and I felt the wholeatmosphere change.      It gave the opportunity   - the first I havehad - of using a clear and very welcome formula in regard tothe entry of our forces into Eire:    &quot;A genuine attempt to prepareourselves for giving assistance to the Eire Government if they invited us to do so in cas . of emergency&quot;.    Mr. de Valera tookcareful heed of these words.     The officer was to be releasedat once IMr.  de Valera had previously spoken about the need for adecision between Government and Government in order that a plan governing our plan of action should be determined.    he proposed to see General Harrison, the Liaison Officer, with mein order to get things straight.     That was when suspicion reigned.He will still see us, but I could see that the real difficulty had gone when I read out the telegram which implied to him that there had never been any other intention.    Nevertheless,he will ask for the position to be fully defined.We then switched over to Eire&apos;s need for arms andequipment and he said that our failure to help had also lentcolour to the idea that we wanted to come in and do the jobourselves.     He thought the pretext that the Irish Army mightlose the equipment very unconvincing!     That excuse had puzzledthem.    I said that the real difficulty was our own desperateneed.     We were not non-co-operating on principle as he thought.Fortunately I had brought with me in case this question came up a copy of a recent cable from our Ambassador in Washingtonindicating that we were giving all help through the BritishPurchasing Commission in the United States of America to getEire 1s indent fulfilled.     This came in most Usefully and he went on to say that whatever our needs might be, if we felt, aswe obviously did feel, that Eire was a danger point for us, thebest insurance we could possibly contrive was to give to Eirethe small amount of equipment which she begged us to grant.He then pressed me very earnestly to do my best inLondon to get for him:-(a) a few anti-tank guns;(b) a few fighter aeroplanes;(c) a few anti-aircraft guns. -He said that Dublin must be defended.     Everything here would goif the Government deserted it.     It could not possibly be declaredan open town.     A few anti-aircraft guns would vitally affectthe nerve centre of the country.He said:-&quot;Why will you not trust us?    If you think we might&quot;attack the North I say with all emphasis we will never do that.* Annex II No
&quot;No solution there can come by force.      There Me must now&quot;wait and let the solution come with time and patience.&quot;If you think the I.K.A. will get the arms, I can&quot;assure you that we have no fifth-column today.      There is&quot;no danger in that quarter.&quot;Give us help with arms and we will fight the Germans&quot;as only Irishmen in their own country can fight.     There is&quot;no doubt on which side my sympathies lie.    Nowadays some&quot;people joke about my becoming pro-British.    The cause I am&quot;urging on you is in the best interest of my own country&quot;and that is what matters most to me&quot;.I said I would do what I could in London, as I hadalready done before.      I added that he must not argue that because we favoured sending our own forces in rather thanparting with arms and equipment it was not because   wehankered to get our troops into Eire.    He must remember thatour forces were available for all liabilities.    If we gave equipment to Eire it would pass from our reserve:    itwould not be at call.   H.e admitted the force of this.However, he is very insistent in his pleading for help and if we wish to get into a happier relationship a concessionhere would achieve wonders.Mr. de. Valera referred to the &quot;Plan&quot; and said it had gone hard with him to turn down any scheme which wouldbrir^g about a United Ireland, the dream of his life.    Butin the present circumstances acceptance had been impossible.It would have meant civil war.    His regret was genuine andhe asked me to mention this to Mr. Neville Chamberlain and to let him know how he felt about it.(Signed) J. L. MAFFEY.17.7.40.
