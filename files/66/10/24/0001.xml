The Chiefs of staff at their meeting on 4th. July agreed that the evacuation hadnot yet become a practical proposition but the Chief of theImperial General Staff undertook to consult the Commander-in-Chief, Liddle East, further on the matter.     Both he and theCommander-in-Chief, East Indies, now consider that evacuationis a practical proposition as convoyed shipping becomes available.2.     The Government of India have stated in reply to an enquirywhether they would accept Service families from the Middle East,that they deprecate the despatch of such families to India onaccount of accommodation in suitable climatic conditions being fully occupied.     But in an emergency they state they would endeavour to take them.The Government, of the Union of South Africa have expressed their willingness to receive these families, and have ashea fordetails as to the financial arrangements to be agreed betweenthem and His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. We understand that the financial authorities are preparedto accept the liability of evacuating families from the middle east, and propose that the conditions governing the evacuation from Hong Kong be accepted as suitable.     The exact detailswould have to be worked out between the Government of India, theUnion of South Africa, and His Majesty&apos;s Government.4.        An escorted convoy of empty fitted&apos;ships leaves Egyptfor India nn ?,Bth August, and sufficient accommodationexistsfor aUtheMilitary Service families in the-Middle East, comprising some, 6,000women and children.     We consider this convoy might be used totake these families to India, where temporary accommodationv/ould be necessary until the necessary shipping becomes available to carry them on to South Africa.     Conditionsiii the Red Sea may, however, change between now and the25th August and the final decision to embark the families wouldbe subject to reconsideration according to the degree of enenryair and submarine activity at the time.r W.M.(40)175th Conclusions, Minute 10.CO.S.(40)207th Conclusions, Minute 5.-1-

II19*?i ^ w5. There appears some clanger that the evacuation ofall Service families from the Middle East might he regarded by Egyptians as an indication of the withdrawalof British Forces from that area and might have a most fortunate effect on Egyptian morale.      Vhereas gibraltar and Malta are small fortresses,  in which families are adefinite and obvious liability, there are possibilities ofdispersion within the Laddie East and the military necessity for evacuation is not therefore so clear4 to thegeneral pub1ic *6. On the other hand the presence of families wouldbe a serious military liabilitjr in the not unlikely eventof serious internal disorder caused by bombing, or other reasons.     Soldiers, particularism those in the desert,would be worried as to the safety of their families andwould fight with less anxiety if they knew these had been moved into safety.     Moreover the necessity for an urgentmass evacuation from Suez during a serious emergency woulddislocate the military operation of the port.7. V7e consider that the reasons in favour of evacuation outweigh the problematical effect on Egyptianopinion.      This view is held by the Cornmaaider-in-Chief,Middle East who has, we understand,been m consultation with HisMajesty&apos;s representative in Egypt.     Vie therefore recommendthat the War Cabinet should reverse its decision of22nd June and authorize the compulsory evacuation of Servicefamilies from the Middle East in the convoy due to leaveEgypt on 25th August, subject to the passage of the red sea being reasonably secure at that time.(Signed)C.J,,1T.
