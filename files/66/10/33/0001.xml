Secretary off &apos;.the War Cabinets1. For some time past the Australian and New zealand governments have been pressing for a full militaryappreciation of the situation in the Far East.2. The Chiefs of staff had no difficulty in reachinggeneral agreement upon the Paper prepared for them by thejoint Staffs except on one point, namely, the line that weshould take if Japan attacked the Netherlands East indies and the Dutch resisted,,3. .       A Paper dealing with this point (W.P. (40)289) was submitted to the War Cabinet, who, at their Meeting on the29th July, invited the Chiefs of Staff tO&apos; prepare an appreciation of the situation in the Far East, on theassumption that Japan committed an act of aggression against the Netherlands East Indies, that the Dutch resisted,and that this country comes to their assistance (W.M. (40)214th Conclusions, Minute 7).      This appreciation is being prepared^.4o In the meantime, the Commonwealth Government andthe Government of New Zealand are becoming somewhat restiveand are reluctant to despatch further troops until theyhave received the military appreciation of the situation inthe Far East.      The Chiefs of&quot; Staff have accrojFdinglycompleted the appreciation which they had in draft beforethe recent submission to the War Cabineto      This appreciationis circulated herewith as W*P0 (40)302o50 The immediate point on which a decision is required is whether the War Cabinet agree that a digest of thisappreciation may be communicated forthwith to the DominionGovernments.      In this connection, particular attention isinvited to the assumptions on which the appreciation hasbeen prepared (See paragraphs 2 and 3 of the covering memorandum).      It will be seen that assumptions (d) and (e)make it&apos;clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government are notcommitrbed in advance to any particular policy.(Signed)    E.  E.

In order to reduce the problem to as simple terms as possible, it hasbeen necessary to make certain assumptions, for example: (a) the military situation in other theatres (i.e., at home and in the middle east) will not change in our favour, to any marked degree, in theimmediate future, i.e., we shall still have to retain a fleet in theEastern Mediterranean for the present;(b) the attitude of the U.S.A. remains as at present, i.e., affording us ameasure of economic and material support;(c) if the Japanese attack British territory, we shall fight them;(d) the question whether we should or should not go to war with Japan inthe event of a Japanese aggression against the Netherlands east indies, which was resisted by the Dutch, must be a matter for decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the light of circumstances at thetime;(e) for the purpose of this appreciation, however, it has been assumed thatwe should go to war in the above contingency, but it should be clearly understood that this assumption is an arbitrary one and does notprejudge the decision which the War Cabinet would have to take whenthe time came.3. If it is to be assumed in accordance with paragraph 2 (e) above, thatwe should go to war with Japan in support of the Dutch, it would be logical torecommend that we should immediately hold Staff Conversations with the Dutch[21529a]
in the Far East in order to concert a combined defence plan. As will be seen from the appreciation we have this in mind, although at present we consider itwould be inadvisable to initiate such conversations in view of the fact that wecould not, with our present very limited resources, provide the Dutch with any effective military assistance.4. The assumption set out in paragraph 2 (e) has a far-reaching effect upon the whole of our appreciation. We have, therefore, marked with a sidelinethose paragraphs to which this assumption applies in particular.(Signed) C. L. N. NEWALL.DUDLEY POUND.J. G. DILL.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 31, 1940.

The Japanese advance into Southern China and Hainan, the developmentof communications and aerodromes in Thailand, the situation in Indo-Chinaresulting from the French collapse, and the increased range of aircraft, have allcontributed to enable Japan to develop an overland threat to Malaya, against which even the arrival of the Fleet would only partially guard.At the same time, the collapse of France, the development of -a-direct threat to the United Kingdom and the necessity for retaining in European waters afleet of sufficient strength to match both the German and Italian Fleets have made it temporarily impossible for us to despatch a fleet to the Far East should theoccasion arise. In consequence, neither of the two underlying assumptions ofthe 1937 review is any longer tenable and we have therefore thought it necessaryto review again our Far East defence problem as a whole. We have done this at length in the annex to this paper. Our conclusions and recommendations are summarised below.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.3.  We sum up our conclusions below under four headings: A. General Considerations.B. The Defence Problem.C. Strategy in the event of war in the Far East in the absence of aFleet.D. Defence Requirements in the Far East in the absence of a Fleet andthe present possibilities of meeting them.f Paper No. D.P. (P) 5, dated June 14, 1937.[21529] R
A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.Japanese Aims.(i) Japan&apos;s ultimate aims are the exclusion of Western influence from theFar East and the control of Far Eastern resources of raw materials.Japan cannot be sure of securing these aims unless she capturesSingapore, which will always be a potential threat to her southwardexpansion so long as a British fleet remains in being in any part ofthe world.Japan&apos;s immediate aim in accordance with her traditional step-by-step policy is likely to be the exclusion of British influence from china and Hong Kong.(paragraph 2),Likelihood of Japanese Action.(ii) The present offers Japan an opportunity to extend her interests; but she is unlikely to risk an open breach with the British Empire and theUnited States until the situation in Europe is clearer (para-graphs 3-10).General Policy in the Far East.(iii) Committed as we are in Europe, and without the help of France, wemust avoid an open clash with Japan. A general settlement, includingeconomic concessions to Japan, should be concluded as soon aspossible. Failing this settlement, our general policy must be to playfor time, cede nothing until we must, and build up our defences as soonas we can. At the same time we should aim at securing the fullmilitary co-operation of the Dutch (paragraphs 11-12).B.-THE DEFENCE PROBLEM.(iv) Primarily the security of India, Malaya and Australasia depends onour ability to control the sea communications leading to them. the foundation of our strategy in the Far East must, therefore, remain thebasing of an adequate fleet on Singapore. Until we have defeatedGermany and Italy, however, or drastically reduced their naval strength, we are faced with the problem of defending our interests inthe Far East without an adequate fleet (paragraph 15).(y) In the absence of a Fleet, we cannot prevent damage to our interests inthe Far East. Our object must, therefore, be to limit the extent of the damage and in the last resort to retain a footing from which we couldeventually retrieve the position when stronger forces become available(paragraph 16).Courses open to the Japanese.(vi) Broadly, there are four possible courses of action open to the Japanese,should they decide to resort to force to improve their position in theFar East: (a) A direct attack on British possessions.(b) A penetration into Indo-China or Thailand.(c) An attack on the Netherlands East Indies.(d) Seizure of the Philippines.(paragraphs 18-28).
(vii) While we must be prepared for a sudden attack on the netherlands east Indies or Singapore we feel that the most probable Japanese firstmove would be into Indo-China or Thailand, possibly followed later byan attack on the Dutch East Indies, if conditions at the time arejudged favourable for such a move, before tackling Singapore itself(paragraph 29).Stage at which British interests would be vitally affected by Japanese aggression.(viii) A Japanese penetration of Thailand would threaten Singapore andunquestionably make the defence of Burma and Malaya far moredifficult. Nevertheless, under present conditions, we do not considerthat the threat to our vital interests would be sufficiently direct tojustify us going to war with Japan with our present available resources (paragraph 32).(ix) For similar reasons we should not under present conditions go to warwith Japan in the event of a Japanese attack on Indo-China(paragraph 33).(x) A Japanese attack on the Netherlands East Indies and the establish-ment of Japanese basesln the islands woiilOir^ctiy&quot; threaten our vital interests. Our sea and air communications and our base at Singaporewould be endangered. We could not under present conditions preventthe Japanese getting a foothold in the Netherlands East Indies. If theDutch did not resist attack we should not go to war with Japan.Even if the Dutch do resist we could not prevent the Japaneseestablishing a foothold in the Netherlands East Indies, but our chances of preventing the Islands being overrun would be much improved.Provided the Dutch resist therefore we should offer them full militaryand economic support against Japan (paragraphs 34-35).British Garrisons in North China.(xi) Our garrisons in North China are, in fact, strategically useless andvis-a-vis Japan are tactically in a hopeless position. Although weshould suffer some loss of prestige by withdrawing them, theadvantages of having them available elsewhere in the Far East would strengthen our military position (paragraph 36).Hong Kong.(xii) Hong Kong is not a vital interest and the garrison could not longwithstand Japanese attack. Even if we had a strong fleet in theFar East, it is doubtful whether Hong Kong could be held now thatthe Japanese are firmly established on the mainland of China; andit could not be used as an advanced naval base.In the event of war, Hong Kong must be regarded as an outpostand held as long as possible. We should resist the inevitably strong pressure to&apos;reinforce Hong Kong and we should certainly be unableto relieve it. Militarily our position in the Far East would be strongerwithout this unsatisfactory commitment (paragraph 37).C-STRATEGY IN THE EVENT OF WAR.Defence of Sea Communications.(xi&quot;) Indian Ocean. Although the Malacca Straits might be denied to japanese Naval forces, these forces might use many other passagesthrough the Netherlands East Indies for operations against our indian ocean trade and our line of communications to the Middle East.Naval and Air forces operating from the Dutch Islands would actas a deterrent to Japanese Naval forces, but would not prevent theiraccess to the Indian Ocean. Communications with Malaya are liableto be precarious but would not be completely severed (para-graphs 40-41),[21529] c
(xiv) South China Sea and Western Pacific.   We should be unable tomaintain our sea communications to the northward of the MalayArchipelago, but we could maintain local traffic within the Archipelagoto a limited extent, given Dutch co-operation (paragraph 42).(xv) TheJ3eas East and South of Australia (including Trans-Pacific routes).We should hope, by means of diversive routeing, use of coastal routes&quot;,and local protection by air and naval forces, to maintain a high proportion of our trade in these areas. The Japanese might establish an advanced fuelling base to facilitate attack in these seas (para-graph 43).Defence of Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific Islands.(xvl) It would be an extremely hazardous operation for Japan to undertake a major expedition against Australia or New Zealand so long asSingapore remained available to us as a base for a fleet in being.The scale of attack is likely to be limited to cruiser raids and lightseaborne air attacks against ports (pragraphs 44 and 45).(xvii) Japan might attempt to seize an advanced base in the Pacific Islands.Suva in Fiji is the most probable objective (paragraph 46).Defence of Malaya.(xviii) It is no longer sufficient to concentrate upon the defence of SingaporeIsland, but it is now necessary to hold the whole of Malaya. this involves an increase in the existing army and air forces (para-graphs 47, 66 (a), 79 and 81).Defence of Burma.(xix) Japanese air bases in Thailand would threaten the Rangoon oil refineryand the air route to Singapore (paragraphs 48-51).Defence of the Netherlands East Indies.(xx) It is important to deny to the Japanese naval and air bases in theNetherlands East Indies and a passage into the Indian Ocean. Forthis we shall have to rely on shore-based air forces operating fromDutch bases in conjunction with light naval forces (para-graphs 52-56).Anglo-Dutch Co-operation.(xxi) The whole problem of defence in the Far East would be much simplifiedif we could be sure of Dutch co-operation and if we could concert planswith the Dutch beforehand. The Dutch would probably be ready toprepare secret plans for the defence of their islands, but we cannot besure they would agree to assist us against a Japanese attack on british territory. In view of our inability to offer the Dutch any effectivemilitary support with our present limited resources, it is not desirableto undertake Staff Conversations at present. It is, however, of theutmost importance that we should concert plans as soon as we are ina position to do so (paragraphs 57 and 58).(xxii) In the absence of Dutch co-operation we should be faced with a gap inour defensive system, and our sea communications would be more seriously threatened. It should still be possible to supply Malayaintermittently, though our difficulties in the Far East would be greatlyincreased (paragraph 59).
p,-DEFENCE REQUIREMENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF A FLEET ANDTHE PRESENT POSSIBILITIES OF MEETING THEM.(xxiii) In the absence of a Fleet our policy should be to rely primarily on airpower. The air forces required to implement that policy, however,cannot be provided for some time to come. Until they can be madeavailable we shall require substantial additional land forces in malaya, which cannot in present circumstances be found from british or Indian resources (paragraphs 62, 80 and 81).(xxiv) The collaboration of the Dutch in the Netherlands East Indies is ofgreat importance, but it would be unsound to rely on the collaboration of a foreign Power to secure the protection of a vitally important partof the Empire. In any event our own defence requirements would notbe substantially affected (paragraph 64).(xxv) With the forces that we have at present available we should concentrate on the defence of Malaya. We could not hope to defend BritishBorneo, and only very limited air forces would be available to assist in the protection of trade in the Indian Ocean (paragraph 72).(xxvi) On the other hand, the British and Dutch together dispose of substan-tial forces, and a direct attack on Singapore would be a veryconsiderable undertaking for the Japanese (paragraph 73).(xxvii) In the absence of a Fleet the naval forces required to co-operate with land and air forces for the defence of Malaya and the netherlands east Indies are more than we now have available in the Far East evenif we get the full co-operation of the Dutch (paragraphs 84-85).(xxviii) Until the situation in European waters is improved we may have to face a serious threat to our Far East trade as we shall be unable tomake available adequate forces for its protection in the event ofdetermined action against it by Japanese forces, particularly if theyuse heavy ships (paragraph 86).(xxix) Our Naval building programmes have never allowed for a war in whichwe alone would be fighting Germany, Italy and Japan. Our best hope of being able to supply naval forces for the Far East in the nearfuture lies in the possibility of early and successful action againstItalian naval forces in the Mediterranean (paragraph 87).4.   In the light of the above conclusions, we recommend: (i) The Commonwealth Government should be asked to provide, and to equip as far as possible, the rough equivalent of one division for thedefence of Malaya (paragraph 81).(ii) Preparations should be set in train in Malaya to receive a second Creinforcing division, in anticipation of it being found possible to make this available from some source at a later date (paragraph 81).(iii) As soon as possible and at the latest by the end of 1940, two squadrons  n /fO e)we*of fighters and two of G.R. land planes should be despatched to theFar East, and the squadrons now in Malaya should be re-equipped and brought up to establishment (paragraph 68). , /(iv) Food reserves for both the expected garrison and the Civil population   -should be built up in Malaya to the utmost practical extent (para-RECOMMENDATIONS.graph 47 (d)).
Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 31, 1940.(v) The views of our Commanders in the Far East should be obtained onthe forces considered necessary to implement the policy laid down inparagraph 62.(vi) Our Naval construction programme should be reviewed in the light ofthis appreciation and the existing programme should be expedited(paragraph 87).(vii) Provision should be made for the increased air forces required in malaya, British Borneo and the Indian Ocean, if possible by theend of 1941 (paragraph 66).(viii) Our garrisons in North china and Hong Kong should be withdrawnif this can be made part of a general settlement in the Far East(paragraphs 36 and 37).(ix) The Governments of India and Burma in consultation with the A.O.C.,Far East, should review their defence requirements in the light of apossible Japanese threat from Thailand (paragraph 51).(x) The aerodromes at Kuching, Miri, Mergui and Victoria Point should at once be prepared for demolition (paragraphs 50 and 72).(xi) The Government of New Zealand should be invited to hold a Brigadeready for despatch to Fiji (paragraph 83).(xii) As soon as we have been able to improve our position in Malaya, staff conversations should be commenced with the Dutch in the Far East.Meanwhile, our Commanders should consider the problem of a combined Anglo-Dutch defence plan so that conversations may beundertaken immediately the opportunity arises. The Governmentsof Australia and New Zealand should be invited to send ServiceRepresentatives to take part in these conversations when the time comes.(Signed) C. L. N. NEWALL.DUDLEY POUND.J. G. DILL.
ANNEX 1.STRATEGY IN THE FAR EAST.We have divided this review of our strategy in the Far East into fourparts: A. General Considerations.B. The Defence Problem.C. Strategy in the event of war in the Far East, in the absence of a Fleet.D. Defence requirements in the Far East in the absence of a Fleet, and thepresent possibilities of meeting them.PART A.-GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.Japanese Aims.2. Japan&apos;s ultimate aims are the exclusion of Western influence from theFar East and the control of Far Eastern resources of raw materials.Japan cannot be sure of securing these aims unless she captures Singapore,which will always be a potential threat to her southward expansion so long as aBritish fleet remains in being in any part of the world.Japan&apos;s immediate aim in accordance with her traditional step-by-steppolicy is likely to be the exclusion of British influence from China and hong Kong.Likelihood of Japanese Action.3. Among the factors which may influence Japan in deciding whether toextend her interests southwards are : -(a) Her military and economic commitment in China.\b) The Russian threat.(c) The military strength by which she might be opposed.(d) The fear of military action by the United States.(e) The economic consequences of war with the United States and the BritishEmpire, on both of which she is largely dependent economically.(/) The prospect of achieving her aims at little or no cost in the event of thewar in Europe going against us.In order to decide our general policy in the Far East, it is essential to assess the extent to which these factors are likely to influence Japanese policy in theimmediate future.4. We are advised that Japan is determined to bring the China war to anend, and that, with the closing of one after another of the arms routes into China,there is a distinct probability that the two countries will soon come to terms. Thewar in China cannot, therefore, be relied on for long to provide a seriousdeterrent to further Japanese activity, although its termination will bring noearly economic relief to Japan.5. Although Russia is at present pre-occupied in Europe, fear of Russianaction will probably compel Japan to retain forces at home and in Manchuria.She must always be conscious of the probability that Russia would be quick totake advantage of the situation if Japan found herself in difficulties.6. The defences of Singapore are formidable and their reduction wouldinvolve a combined operation of the first magnitude. Further, Japan must nowreckon on the collaboration with the British of the substantial Dutch forces inthe Netherlands East Indies against any southward thrust.On the other hand, the forces in Malaya are still far short of requirements,particularly in the air; and Japan must know that in present circumstances weshould be unable to send an adequate fleet to the Far East.. 7. Japan may gamble on the assumption that provided she takes no direct action against American citizens or American possessions the United Statesjs unlikely to be goaded to the point of armed opposition. She may foresee, also,that in the event of-Great Britain&apos;s position in Europe deteriorating, it is probabletoat the United States would keep their fleet in the Atlantic.
Although Manila is not comparable as a base to Singapore and the sea com-munications to the Philippines are more vulnerable to Japanese attack than those to Singapore, nevertheless Manila is a defended base and lies in the line of any japanese advance to the South. The Japanese can never be certain that theUnited States will not intervene and send their fleet to the Philippines.8. One of the main influences must be the knowledge that further aggressionmay lead to a rupture of trade relations with the United States and Great Britain.The United States has already warned Japan of her interest in the maintenanceof the status quo in the Netherlands East Indies.On the long-term view, Japan&apos;s economic structure cannot stand the strainof a break with the British Empire and the Americas, upon whom she is dependentfor markets and for essential raw materials. Only if she could rapidly gaincomplete control of the raw materials, especially oil, rubber and tin, of malaya and the Dutch East Indies would she have a chance of withstanding British and american economic pressure.9. With the example of Italy before her, Japan may prefer to postpone anymain advance until she sees more clearly the outcome of affairs in Europe. if germany succeeds^ Japan could achieve her aims quickly and without risk. Onthe other hand, she might abandon her traditional step-by-step policy and makea direct attack upon Singapore.We are advised that any steps Japan takes may be limited to local military action without resort to formal declaration of war, thus hoping to evade thefar-reaching effects of war with the British Empire and possibly the UnitedStates. Such a policy would enable Japan to limit her action and &quot; save face &quot;if the local results or wider reactions were unfavourable.. 10. To sum up, it appears to us that, until the issue of the war in Europebecomes clearer, it is probable that Japan will confine her action to the elimination of British influence from China and Hong i^ong to the greatest possible extentwithout incurring a rupture with the United States and the British Empire.General Policy in the Far East.11. Our own commitments in Europe are so great that our policy must bedirected towards the avoidance of an open clash with Japan. We have, in fact,to make a virtue of military necessity, and it is at least doubtful whether piecemealconcessions will ever have more than a temporarily alleviating effect, to be followedafter an interval by further demands.&apos;It is most desirable that a wide settlement in the Far East includingeconomic concessions to Japan should be concluded as early as possible, ratherthan that we should wait to be faced with a series of Japanese faits accomplis.The possibilities of obtaining such a settlement at the present time are doubtful;but we are convinced that every effort should be made to bring it about.12. Failing a general settlement on satisfactory terms with Japan, our general policy should be to play for time; to cede nothing until we must; and tobuild up our defences as soon as we can. In this connection we show inPart C that an aim of our policy should be ultimately to secure the full military co-operation-operation of the Dutch.13. We now proceed to examine the problem of Far Eastern defence in itsbroadest aspect.PART B.-THE DEFENCE PROBLEM.British Interests in the Far East.14.   Our interests in the Far East may be summarised as follows : (a) The Dominions of Australia and New Zealand.(b) Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies both contain essential rawmaterials, the control of which at source is now extremely important to us. The establishment of a footing by the Japanese in either area would directly threaten the security of the naval base at Singapore(c) Burma is also of importance on account of its oil resources and inconnection with the sea and air communications to Singapore.
Shore-based aircraft  SquadronsFighters     ...... .,. .........        8-10Light Bombers      ... ... ...      ...       ...        8-10Heavy Bombers     ... ... ...      ...      ...       8-10Reconnaissance     ... ... ...      ...       ...        4-628-36(336-423 aircraft).These forces are clearly large enough to give Japan a very wide choice of objectives.(d) The trade routes in (i) The Indian Ocean (including the West Coast of Australia),(ii) The South China Sea and Western Pacific (north of Australia),(hi) The seas east and south of Australia, including the Trans-Pacificroutes.(e) China trade. A great deal of British capital is invested in the Chinatrade, but this trade represents only about 2 per cent, of total british trade, and its cessation would not seriously affect the ability of theEmpire to carry on the war.(f) Hong Kong is an important commercial harbour and a naval base, and afocus of British interests in China. Its value as an entrepot of tradeand shipping has been considerably curtailed by the Japanese actionin China.(g) Shanghai is important mainly in connection with the China trade.   Theretention of the British garrison is largely a question of prestige.Security primarily dependent on the Fleet.15. The territorial integrity of Australia and New Zealand and of ourpossessions in the Far East depends primarily on our ability to control the sea communications leading to them. We see no reason, therefore, to change theviews we have always expressed namely, that the foundation of our strategy inthe Far East must be the basing on Singapore of a fleet which is strong enoughto provide cover for our communications in the Indian Ocean and South-western pacific, and to frustrate any large expeditions which the Japanese may attemptagainst British territory. Meanwhile, that is to say until we have defeatedGermany and Italy or have drastically reduced their naval strength, we are facedwith the problem of attempting to defend our Far Eastern interests in the absenceof an adequate fleet.Our Strategic Object in the Absence of a Fleet.16. In the absence of a Fleet, we cannot prevent damage to our interests in the Far East. Our object must, therefore, be to limit the extent of the damage and in the last resort to retain a footing from which we could eventuallyretrieve the position when stronger forces become available.The Threat to our Interests in the Far East in the Absence of a Fleet.Forces which Japan now has available.17.   We are advised that Japan could make the following forces availablefor new adventures : Naval 10 battleships, 3 to 7 aircraft carriers, with the necessary cruiser and destroyer forces.Military 6 to 10 divisions. Japan could make this force and the shippingrequired for its transport and maintenance available without having to carry out any serious withdrawal from her positionin China.Carrier-borne Aircraft Up to 75 fighter aircraft, 206 bomber aircraft, carrier-borne.To these must be added the operation of shore-based aircraft once japan had established herself ashore.  For this purpose Japan could dispose of :
Courses open to the Japanese.18. Broadly, there are four possible courses of action open to the Japaneseshould they decide to resort to force to improve their position in the Far East:-!(a) A direct attack on British possessions.(b) A penetration into Indo-China or Thailand.(c) An attack on the Netherlands East Indies.(a) Seizure of the Philippines.We consider these courses in turn.Attack on British Possessions.19. If Japan decided to make a direct attack upon British possessions, weconsider that her main effort would be directed ultimately against Malaya,because, as we have already pointed out in paragraph 2 above, the capture of singapore would be essential to Japan if she intended to secure permanently thecontrol of the Far East.It is, however, an historical fact that the Japanese method is one of acautious step-by-step progress with limited objectives. Her first step is likelyto be to overwhelm our garrisons in China and absorb our possessions there, andprobably to attack or at least blockade Hong Kong, all without a declaration ofwar. The tempo and even the extent of her subsequent action would beconditioned by the ease and success of these initial operations, and their widerreactions; it is even possible, if the reactions were unfavourable, that theJapanese would refrain from further adventures. We have, however, to considerthe worst case, and to assume that Japan will not be deterred from her aim ofdominating the whole of the Far East.20. Japan would have an ample margin of naval strength over and above that required for an attack on Malaya, and attacks on British trade wouldcertainly figure largely in her plans. Our China trade, except for the little thatmight be carried in neutral bottoms, would cease on the outbreak of war, and ourIndian Ocean, Australasian and Trans-Pacific trade would be exposed to the threat of Japanese action.21. Apart from attacks on trade, we do not consider that any serious threat to Australia or New Zealand would arise until Japan had consolidated her position at Singapore. Even then we do not consider that the Japanese would attempt an actual invasion of Australia or New Zealand, at least until they hadconsolidated their position in China and the Far East, which would take a veryconsiderable time.   This is further explained in paragraph 44 below.22. The effort involved in war with the British Empire would be great for japan, even in the absence of a British fleet, and for this reason we feel that japan would hesitate to adopt this course unless she saw Great Britain so heavilycommitted in Europe as to be unable to resist her aggression, or until she was completely freed from the entanglement of the China campaign. Nevertheless,we must be prepared to resist an assault against Singapore, and by increasing our defences aim at deterring Japan from adopting this course.Penetration of Indo-China or Thailand.23. The penetration of Indo-China or Thailand would give the Japanesebases from which to attack Malaya, and among other advantages would secure for them substantial rice supplies. An attack on Indo-China would not be a formidable undertaking for Japan, as her action would probably be confined to the limited objectives of seizing bases and aerodromes and controlling focal points inthese countries. It might be effected without the United States of Americabreaking off economic relations. All the evidence goes to show that the ThaiGovernment would not oppose a Japanese penetration by force, while the french forces in Indo-China could not prevent a Japanese occupation of the ports and railways. We ourselves ; could not effectively assist in the defence of eitherIndo-China or Thailand.24. ^If Indo-China adopted a hostile attitude to us, it is conceivable that japan might be granted the use of base facilities in that country.
attack on Netherlands East Indies.25. An attack on the Netherlands East Indies would be a more formidableundertaking for Japan than penetration of Indo-China or Thailand. Neverthe-less, it would probably not involve excessive military effort, especially if it were undertaken by stages, and occupation would not only provide Japan with an advanced base for a subsequent attack on Singapore, but would secure for her oiland other urgently required raw materials.26. The possibility of the Japanese seizing Portuguese Timor as a first step in their attack on the Netherlands East Indies is considered in paragraph 56.27. The security of the Netherlands East Indies would be considerably improved if the Dutch could be persuaded to agree to re-organising their defencesas part of a combined Anglo-Dutch scheme of defence.The Seizure of the Philippines.28. This would be in keeping with Japan&apos;s step by step methods, and wouldhave the advantage of removing the threat to Japanese sea communications to thesouth which must always exist as long as Manila remains as a United Statesfleet base. It would also afford Japan suitable advanced bases for naval forces and a useful air route from Formosa to Borneo.Nevertheless, we do not consider it likely, since it would inevitably involveJapan in war with the United States, and economically the possession of the philippines would not be of great importance to Japan;Japan&apos;s Probable Course of Action.29. Unless Japan is driven to extreme measures by her militarists ortempted by our apparent weakness, we think that she will try to avoid war withthe British Empire and the United States of America, and endeavour to achieveher aims by stages, which she might hope would not involve her openly in warwith either.Of these, the Netherlands East Indies afford greater economic and strategicadvantages to the Japanese than Indo-China or Thailand, but in Japanese eyesthese advantages may well be offset by the prospect of antagonising the UnitedStates, even if the consequences of such antagonism were confined to the economic sphere. Moreover, in the event of United States hostility, Japan&apos;s lines ofcommunication to the Netherlands East Indies would be threatened from the philippines. Since the Dutch are now our Allies, Japan must at least recognise the probability that an attack on the Netherlands East Indies would involve herin war with us.Therefore, while we must be prepared for a sudden attack on the netherlands east Indies or Singapore we feel that the most probable Japanese first movewould be into Indo-China or Thailand, possibly followed later by an attack onthe Netherlands East Indies if conditions at the time are judged favourable forsuch a move, before tackling Singapore itself.30. We must now consider at what point our vital interests might becomeso endangered that it would be necessary for us to declare war on Japan;Stage at which British Interests would be vitally affected by Japanese Aggression.31. We have already pointed out that the security of Australia and NewZealand and our possessions in the Far East depends primarily on our ability tocontrol the sea communications leading to them.A Japanese penetration of Thailand would not seriously endanger those sea communications and so could not be considered an immediate threat to our vital interests.  On the other hand, it would enable the Japanese-(a) to establish shore-based aircraft within range of Singapore, Penang,the Malacca Straits and the Rangoon oil refineries;(b) to organise a base for a land advance against Malaya from the north;(c) to interfere with the air reinforcement route between India and Malaya;(d) possibly to establish an advanced base for submarines and light craftat the northern entrance to the Malacca Straits.
32. A Japanese penetration of Thailand would thus threaten Singapore andunquestionably make the defence of Burma and Malaya far more difficult. Never-theless, under present conditions, we do not consider that the threat to our vital interests would be sufficiently direct to justify us going to war with Japan withour present available resources.33. Penetration of Indo-China; for similar reasons we should not, under present conditions, go to war with Japan in the event of a Japanese attack onIndo-China.34. A Japanese attack on the Netherlands East Indies is in a different category. If Japan established herself in the Islands our whole system ofdefence would be most gravely compromised, our vital sea. communications andour base at Singapore would be endangered, and the air route from Singaporeto Australia would be threatened. For these reasons the security of theNetherlands East Indies must be regarded as an essential British interest, secondin importance only to the integrity of Singapore and Australasia; and their defence as an important part of our own Far Eastern defence plans.35. The results of the establishment of&apos;a Japanese foothold of any sortin these islands would be so serious that under normal conditions we shouldhave no hesitation in recommending war with Japan to prevent it. In presentconditions we clearly could not prevent it by force, even with the full collaboration of the Dutch. A combination of British and Dutch opposition, however, would constitute a considerable problem for Japan. We should, therefore, do all we canto induce the Dutch to resist any territorial demands and should offer them allthe support we can, including both military and economic action against Japan.We should do this without a formal declaration of war, since the presentation ofa bold Anglo-Dutch front to J apanese demands might cause them to abandon their demands, without undue loss of &quot; face.&quot;British Position in China.North China.36. The fact that our position in North China Would be untenable in theevent of war with Japan has already been recognised by the orders issued to troops at Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai to offer no forcible opposition to japanese aggression. Our garrisons in North China are, in fact, strategically uselessand vis-a-vis Japan are tactically in a hopeless position. This situation isprobably well appreciated by both the Japanese and Chinese. Although we shouldsuffer some loss of prestige by withdrawing them, the advantages of having themavailable elsewhere in the Far East would strengthen our military position. Fromthe purely military point of view, therefore, we recommend that they should be withdrawn, although we recognise that there are other considerations which maymake their retention desirable, except as part of a general settlement.Hong Kong.37. Our position at Hong Kong is different, as this is a British Colony.Nevertheless, Hong Kong is not a vital interest and the garrison could notlong withstand Japanese attack. Even if we had a strong fleet in the Far East,it is doubtful whether Hong Kong with its present defences could be held now that the Japanese are firmly established on the mainland of China; and it couldcertainly not be used as an advanced naval base.Should it be found possible to negotiate a general settlement in the Far Eastit would be in our best military interests to arrange to demilitarise Hong Kong,obtaining the best quid pro quo for this concession. Except as part of such general settlement, demilitarisation of Hong Kong is impracticable owing to theloss of prestige which it would entail.In the event of war, Hong Kong must be regarded as an outpost and held as long as possible. We should resist the inevitably strong pressure to reinforceHong Kong and we should certainly be unable to^ relieve it. Militarily ourposition in the Far East would be stronger without this unsatisfactorycommitment.
1 &apos;HPART C. STRATEGY IN THE EVENT OF WAR IN THE FAR EASTIN THE ABSENCE OF A FLEET.38. The Far Eastern interests which we must do our utmost to defend inthe event of war with Japan can thus be reduced to the following :  (a) Essential sea communications.(b) Australia and New Zealand.(c) Malaya.(d) Burma.(e) The Netherlands East Indies.We consider these in turn.Sea Communications.39. The sea communications most likely to be threatened by Japanese action can be considered under three headings : \ (a) The Indian Ocean (including the west coast pf Australia).lb) The South China Sea and Western Pacific (north of Australia), and(c) The seas east and south of Australia, including the Trans-Pacific routes.The Indian Ocean.40. The Indian Ocean would be the most fruitful field for Japanese actionagainst our seaborne trade, since the main routes from the United Kingdom tothe Middle East, India and the East Indies and Australia pass through it.Although the Malacca Straits might be denied to Japanese Naval Forces, these forces might use many other passages through the Netherlands East Indies for operations against bur Indian Ocean trade&quot; and our line of communication to middle East through the Red Sea. Although the distances from Japan are great,there are a number of potential fuelling bases in the Indian Ocean.A force of enemy cruisers, particularly if supported by one or more heavyships, would constitute a most serious threat to our trade, since we could not spareadequate naval forces either for operations in focal areas or, as would more probably be necessary, for the escort of convoys.Our communications with Malaya would be precarious, though not neces-sarily completely severed.41. Our ability to use the Dutch Islands and to establish air forces there,while not prohibiting Japanese access to the Indian Ocean would act as a deterrent, it would, moreover, assist the maintenance of our communications with australia and New Zealand.   Dutch co-operation would, of course, be essential.The South China Sea and Western Pacific.42. We should be unable to maintain our sea communications to thenorthward of the Malay Archipelago, but we could maintain local traffic withinthe Archipelago to a limited extent, given Dutch co-operation.The seas east and south of Australia, including the Trans-Pacific Routes.43. The trans-Pacific trade routes are important in connection with supplies from America to Australasia and the Far East, as well as providing analternative channel of communication with the United Kingdom which wouldbe increased in importance if our difficulties on the Cape route became acute.1 he Australian and New Zealand trade routes are essential to the economic life of these Dominions.The distances from Japan are considerable, but there would be nothing toprevent the Japanese (provided they were not deterred by fear of Americanaction) establishing advanced fuelling bases in the South Sea Islands in orderto facilitate operations in the south-west Pacific. The wide scope for evasiverouteing would provide a high degree of security for the trans-Pacific tradeexcept in the neighbourhood of the Western terminals. Evasive routeing, whichshould be practicable to some extent, and the use of inshore routes, Would also
provide some degree of protection for the Australian and New Zealand trade.Here, again, the danger of attack would probably be greatest in the approaches to ports, for which local air and naval protection would be required.Defence of Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific Islands.44. We have already stated that, in our opinion, no serious threat to theterritorial integrity of Australia or New Zealand would be likely to arise atleast until Japan had consolidated her position in China and the Far East, whichwould take a considerable time.It would be an extremely hazardous operation of war for Japan to undertake a major expedition to Australia or New Zealand so long as Singapore remainedavailable to us as a base for a fleet in being on the flank of their long lines of com-munication. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the protection of the lines ofcommunication of an expedition of any considerable size over the distance involved would impose a very heavy drain on the Japanese naval forces, as every importantconvoy would have to be protected against the maximum scale of attack whichwe could bring to bear against it at our own selected moment. This wouldprobably mean escort by heavy ships.45. The scale of attack on Australia or New Zealand is likely to be limitedto cruiser raids, possibly combined with a light scale of sea-borne air attack against ports. We have already mentioned the possibility of the Japaneseestablishing advanced fuelling bases in the South-West Pacific Islands in orderto facilitate such operations. There are innumerable potential bases in these islands which could not all be defended against Japanese attack.Fiji.46. From the Japanese point of view it would clearly be preferable to seizea harbour with existing base facilities, particularly Suva in Fiji. Suva wouldalso be a useful advanced base for our own forces in this area. We accordinglyconsider that forces should be held available for the reinforcement of Fiji.Defence of Malaya.47. The more important factors affecting the defence of Malaya in theabsence of a fleet are as follows : (a) The necessity of preventing the establishment of shore-based aircraftwithin close range of the base at Singapore.(b) Even if the Japanese had not previously established themselves inThailand, it is more likely that they would attempt a landingup-country in Malaya and then operate southwards, under cover ofshore-based than that they would risk a direct assault onSingapore Island.(c) The rice-growing country, on which the native population partly depends,and most of the Government storage centres are in the north.(d) The necessity for establishing food reserves for the garrison and for thecivil population of Malaya for as long a period as possible. We havealready pointed out that our sea communications with Malaya mightbe precarious, but we consider that it would be extremely difficult for the Japanese to blockade the Malayan peninsula completely, andwe would expect to be able to get supplies intermittently to our forcesin that country, though not necessarily through the port of Singapore.These factors all point to the necessity for holding the whole of Malayarather than concentrating on the defence of Singapore Island. This clearlyinvolves larger land and air forces than when the problem was merely one of defending Singapore Island.Defence of Burma.48. The possibility of a Japanese occupation of Thailand raises the questionof the defence of Burma, since key points such as the Rangoon oil refineries and aerodromes on the Burmese section of the Singapore air route would be
17immediately threatened by air attack from bases in Thailand. The invasion ofBurmese territory is a more distant threat, except in the extreme South whereit would be possible for Japan to capture aerodromes such as Victoria Point andMergui.49. To deal with these threats it may be desirable that air forces shouldbe permanently established at bases such as Lashio, Rangoon and Tavoy andthat additional troops (above those already earmarked) and air defences shouldbe provided. The defence of Malaya must, however, have precedence over burma and the provision of such forces can only be a very long term project.50. On a shorter view the problem is to limit the Japanese threat with theresources likely to be available. It is necessary in the first place to ensure thatthe air route between Singapore and Rangoon is kept open. The aerodromes in burma as far south as Tavoy and in Malaya as far north as Alor Star must therefore be held. If the aerodromes at Lashio, Rangoon and Tavoy aredeveloped, stocked, and defended, it may then be possible, if the situation permits,to move air forces from Malaya or India to assist Burma in dealing with a suddenthreat from the north. It will be important to deny the Japanese the use ofthe aerodromes at Victoria Point and Mergui, and we recommend that they shouldbe prepared for demolition now.51. We suggest that both the long and short term problems of the defenceof Burma to meet a Japanese threat from Thailand should be reviewed on theselines by the Governments of India and Burma in consultation with the Ait-Officer Commanding in the Far East.Defence of the Netherlands East Indies.52. The defence of the Netherlands East Indies against the Japanese wouldbe important to us because it is desirable to deny the enemy the use of Naval andAir bases in the Islands.53. Moreover, the Islands extend for some hundreds of miles through whichthere are several important channels leading to the Indian Ocean. Control over these channels could be exercised by air and light naval forces based on one orother of the following alternative lines :  (a) the Northern line of Islands from Singapore to New Guinea, or(&amp;) the Southern line from Sumatra through Java to Port Darwin.With the forces at present available we ourselves can do little to dispute thepassage of these channels. Even with the help of the Dutch the measure ofcontrol we should be able to exert would be very limited, but it is clear that theppsition will be improved with Dutch assistance. Which of the two lines ofdefence should be used is a matter which could only be decided by the local commanders on the spot.54. If the Japanese are to be denied bases, invasion must be prevented, andthis entails an attack on an expedition during its approach, as the Dutch militaryforces are limited and mainly concentrated in Java. In our position of navalnumerical inferiority the best form of defence would be shore-based air forcesin conjunction with submarines, light naval forces and mines.55. It would be most advantageous to establish a permanently occupiedBritish air base in North Borneo, and, from a long-term point of view, we considerthat this should be our aim in order to give our air forces greater mobility. Thedevelopment and defence of such a base would take time, would inevitably beregarded with disfavour by the Japanese, unless it was accepted as part of ageneral settlement, and would require resources that we do not yet possess. Wemust, therefore, rely initially for the defence of this area on the operation of airforces from Dutch bases of which there are a number already established on bothlines of defence referred to in paragraph 5356. There is the possibility that the Japanese might seize the Portuguesehalf of Timor as a first step. As there are no existing air or naval bases in thisPart of the island, we consider this is an unlikely step, particularly asthe Japanese must know that Portugal is our oldest ally, and that such action might lead to war with us.
Anglo-Dutch Co-operation.57. The whole problem of defence in the Far East would be greatly facilitated if we could be sure of Dutch co-operation and if we could concertplans with the Dutch beforehand. Our aim should be to achieve a scheme ofdefence which ensures full mutual support, the pooling of resources and thedevelopment of a system for the rapid movement of troops to threatened points.58. In all probability the Dutch would be ready to prepare secret plans for the defence of the Netherlands East Indies, though we might have some difficulty in persuading them to agree to come to our assistance in the event of a japanese attack on British territory alone. In present circumstances, however,with our limited resources in the Far East, it would not be possible to offer theDutch any effective military support in the event of Japanese aggression. Forthis reason, therefore, we do not recommend that staff conversations should beheld with the Dutch immediately. As soon as we have been able to improve ourown position in Malaya, however, we consider it of the utmost importance thatwe should concert plans with the Dutch. Meanwhile, our Commanders in theFar East should be instructed to consider the problem of a combined Anglo-DutchDefence plan so that conversations may be undertaken immediately the opportunityarises. The Governments of Australia and New Zealand should be invited tosend service representatives to take part in these conversations when the time comes.Defence of Malaya in the Absence of Dutch Co-Operation.59. Should the Japanese attack the Netherlands East Indies we can reasonably expect Dutch co-operation in any defence schemes which it may bepossible to concert. Should the Japanese attack Malaya, however, it is conceivable that this co-operation would not be forthcoming as Dutch interests would not be immediately affected. In this event we should be faced with a gap in our defensivesystem, and our sea communications in the Indian Ocean would be more seriouslythreatened. We have already said in paragraph 40 above that our communications with Malaya are liable to be precarious but would not be completely severed, andit should still be possible even without Dutch collaboration to get some suppliesinto Malaya intermittently. It would, however, be idle to pretend that if theDutch did withhold their co-operation, our difficulties in the Far East would notbe greatly increased.Conclusions.60. In the absence of a capital ship Fleet we shall not be able fully tosecure our vital interests in the Far East and we are therefore faced with theproblem of making the best dispositions possible to secure the most important ofthese interests without the cover that a capital ship Fleet would provide. our examination of this problem has shown that if in addition to defending Malayawe could deny to the Japanese the establishment of bases in the netherlands east Indies, and if the movement of their Naval forces through the line of these islands could be impeded, the security of our interests would be considerably improved. Our ultimate aim therefore must be to secure the full military co-operation-operation of the Dutch. In the absence of full Dutch co-operation we mustconcentrate on the defence of Malaya.PART D.-DEFENCE REQUIREMENTS IN THE FAR EAST IN THEABSENCE OF A FLEET AND THE PRESENT POSSIBILITIES of meeting THEM.61.   This section of the Paper  (a) Indicates the Naval, land and air forces required, in the absence of afleet, to defend British territories in the Far East and to provide suchprotection to our own sea communications as can be afforded.(b) Suggests how far our requirements can be met with existing forces.
Defence Policy.62. Our policy in the Far East until a fleet again becomes available shouldbe to rely primarily on air power in conjunction with such naval forces as can bemade available. Land forces will also be essential for the close defence of navaland air bases, for internal security, and for dealing with such enemy land forces as may succeed in gaining a footing in Malaya and British Borneo despite theaction of the Air Force.The Air Forces required to implement this policy are outlined in para-graph 66 below. It is clear that their provision must be in the nature of a long-term programme; and that, until they can be provided, we must make up fortheir absence as far as possible by the provision of additional land forces.63.   In considering these proposals two factors must be borne in mind : (a) As we have shown above, the prospect of any large-scale attack uponAustralia or New Zealand need not be taken seriously into accountunless Singapore were first to be neutralised.(b) The collaboration of the Dutch Forces in the Netherlands East Indiesis of the utmost importance. Although we can never entirely rely on Dutch forces to assist in the defence of Malaya itself, it is only with the active co-operation of the Dutch that we can hope to denythe enemy the use of bases in the Islands. At the same time, givenDutch co-operation, we should be able to exert some measure ofcontrol over the channels through the Archipelago, thus reducing the threat to our trade in the Indian Ocean, and improving our communi-cations with Australia.64. We have shown in Part C above that an ultimate aim of our policy should be to secure the full military co-operation of the Dutch. It would,however, be unsound to rely on the collaboration of a foreign Power to securethe protection of a vitally important part of the Empire; in assessing our requirements, therefore, we have not taken Dutch collaboration into account.In point of fact our requirements are not thereby substantially affected, since,even if the Dutch are co-operating with us, it is always possible that the enemymay carry out diversions against the Netherlands East Indies and thereby containDutch forces at a critical time.Australia and New Zealand.65. The requirements for the defence of Australia and New Zealand are amatter for the Dominion Governments to decide and we do not discuss them inthis paper.Air Forces.Air requirements.66. An exact estimate of the strength and disposition of the Air forces required must depend upon an Appreciation on the spot by the Commanders inthe Far East in collaboration with the Australian and New Zealand defenceauthorities. The following is a general indication, based on the necessity tomeet a Japanese attack on the north of Malaya from Indo-China or Thailand,while at the same time leaving sufficient forces to deal with the possibility of aseaborne invasion on the coast of Malaya or an attack on Singapore Island itself.It also includes provision of air forces for trade protection in the focal areas ofthe Indian Ocean.(a) For defence of Malaya Northern Malaya Bombers, 4 Squadrons, 64 aircraft.Fighters, 2 Squadrons, 32 aircraft.Singapore Torpedo Bombers, 2 Squadrons, 32 aircraft.Fighters, 2 Squadrons, 32 aircraft.
East of Malaya G.R. Landplane, 2 Squadrons, 42 aircraft.G.R. Flying Boat, 1 Squadron, 6 aircraft.(b) For trade protection in the North-Eastern Half of the Indian Ocean.Calcutta, Ceylon, Penang G.R. Landplane, 3 Squadrons, 42 aircraft.A ndamans G.R. Flying Boat, 2 Squadrons, 12 aircraft.(c) For defence of British Borneo, which is necessary not only to deny to theenemy bases from which he could attack Singapore, but also tosecure British territory and the oilfields at Miri.Bombers, 2 Squadrons, 32 aircraft.G.R. Landplane, 2 Squadrons, 42 aircraft.Total for (a) (b) and (c) above 336 first line aircraft.67. This is a very substantial addition to any programme hitherto contem-plated. It must be remembered, however, that in framing our previous programmes (i) The move of a Battle Fleet to the Far East has always been taken for granted. This has meant that our air requirements, both in theIndian Ocean and in Borneo, have not been so great,(ii) We have not had to take into consideration the situation in which theJapanese have virtually overrun South China, and both French Indo-China and Thailand have become potential bases for Japanese airforces.(iii) We have never seriously considered the necessity for defending BritishBorneo.Moreover, experience has shown that it is unsound to rely, as in previous programmes, upon reinforcement from India and Iraq.If, however, we are to afford a reasonable degree of air protection to our vital interests in the Far East and the Indian Ocean, the above is considered theminimum that we should aim at in the absence of a Battle Fleet.68. It will obviously be some considerable time before the above require-ments can be met from United Kingdom and Australian and New Zealandresources. The date must depend largely upon the progress of the war in Europe,on the rate at which our production of aircraft and of personnel can be sustained, and on the supply of aircraft from the U.S.A. Subject to these considerations, we recommend that our aim should be to complete the aboveprogramme by the end of 1941, and as soon as possible, and at any rate by the endof 1940, to reinforce the Far East Command by at least 2 Fighter and 2 G.E.Landplane squadrons, and to re-equip and bring up to establishment the existingsquadrons.Existing air forces.69. Meanwhile, the British and Australian air forces in Malaya consist ofthe following : Bombers, 3 Squadrons, 36 aircraft.Torpedo Bombers, 2 Squadrons, 24 aircraft, obsolete type.G.R. Landplane, 2 Squadrons, 24 aircraft.G.R. Flying Boat, 1 Squadron, 4 aircraft, obsolete type.Total, 88 first line aircraft.70.   The Dutch air forces now in the Netherlands East Indies consist of bombers, 9 Squadrons, 81 aircraft.Fighters, 2 Squadrons, 24 aircraft.Bomber/Reconn., 1 Squadron, 12 aircraft.Flying Boats, 27 aircraft.Total: 144 First-Line Aircraft.
71. The Dutch expansion programme now being implemented will addanother 42 fighters about January 1941, and in 1941 an additional 48 fighters,94 bombers and 18 reconnaissance aircraft, bringing the Dutch totals up to346 first-line aircraft.While these substantial Dutch air forces would be a valuable addition to thedefence of our common interests in the Far East against Japanese attack, it isobvious that they can in no way make up for the totally inadequate strength ofour own air forces in Malaya.72. It is clear, therefore, that until we can at least reduce our very seriousdeficiency in air strength in this part of the world, the best we can hope for is topresent a deterrent to attack and concentrate on the defence of the foremost ofour vital interests in the Far East, namely, Singapore. It must be recognisedthat under the conditions now prevailing and in the immediate future we cannothope to secure the defence of British Borneo.As a short-term policy, therefore, we must be prepared to demolish the aero-dromes at both Kuching and Miri in order to deny their use to the enemy. Plansalready exist for the destruction of the Miri oilfields.When the defence requirements of Malaya have been satisfied, and whenfurther resources become available we should undertake the defence and develop-ment of Kuching. Miri would in this phase still be kept in readiness fordemolition. Ultimately our policy would be to establish defended bases forthe operation of the air forces referred to in paragraph 66 (c) at Kuching andJesselton.It is clear that at present and in the immediate future only very limited airforces could be made available to assist in the protection of our trade in the.Indian Ocean.   On special occasions aircraft could be diverted from other tasksto cover a passage on a convoy.73. Nevertheless, the situation is not so black as it may appear. TheBritish and Dutch air forces between them now dispose of a total of more than200 aircraft of a quality equal, and in some respects superior, to those of Japan.Experience has shown that to venture a seaborne expedition within range of modern air forces involves grave risks, so that even with our present air forces a direct attack on Singapore would be a very formidable undertaking.It is, however, clear that until we can attain a standard of air defenceapproximating more closely to our estimated requirements, we should do every-thing possible to increase our land forces in Malaya, and, as soon as our positionin this respect is sufficiently improved, to secure the effective collaboration of theDutch.Requirements of the Dutch.74. In paragraphs 52-55 the desirability of obtaining Dutch collaboration with a view to securing a measure of control over the channels through theNetherlands East Indies to the Indian Ocean has been emphasised. As soon asit becomes possible to undertake Staff Conversations with the Dutch they shouldbe pressed to station some of their units in Borneo, to improve the aerodromes inthe islands and to provide certain additional A.A. defence troops for their security. The development of air routes within the Netherlands East Indies and between Australia and Singapore for reinforcement purposes must be stressed asan essential factor for the general defence of the whole area.Land Forces.Burma.75. As regards the defence of Burma, we recommend (paragraph 51) thatthe Governments of India and Burma should review the situation. Extra troops and anti-aircraft equipment will almost certainly be required, for the protectionof air bases in particular.China.76. We do not recommend that our garrisons in North China, and at HongKong should be reinforced in any circumstances. In the event of a general settle-ment with Japan leading to the withdrawal of these garrisons, they would become available for employment elsewhere, e.g., Malaya or North Borneo.
British Borneo.77. We stated in paragraph 66 (c) that eventually we should require bases for four shore-based squadrons in British Borneo. This must remain a long-term policy as it will be a considerable time before the aerodromes can be prepared.They will then require troops and anti-aircraft defences for their protection.Commanders in the Far East should be instructed to investigate the preciserequirements.. Netherlands East Indies.78. We have already shown in paragraph 55 that so far as the defence ofthe Netherlands East Indies is concerned, we must for some time to come rely onthe operation of air forces from Dutch bases. The provision of troops for thelocal protection of these bases must be a matter for the Dutch.The Dutch have a total of two divisions in Java and fourteen garrisonbattalions at outlying stations. Tarakan, Balikpapan, Macassar and Amboynaeach have a garrison battalion. We understand that the troops are not of high quality, but they are reasonably well equipped, except that there is a serious lackof anti-aircraft guns. Such guns as are available are in Java. The Dutch shouldbe pressed during staff conversations to increase their garrisons at certain of themore important air bases.Malaya.79. We have pointed out in paragraph 47 that it is no longer sufficient to concentrate upon the defence of Singapore Island, but that it is noAv necessary tohold the whole of Malaya. It is also clearly essential to ensure that the aerodromesrequired for the operation of our own air forces are rendered safe from capture.We consider that the total minimum garrison in Malaya required to meet these commitments is the equivalent of six brigades with ancillary troops-provided the air forces mentioned in paragraph 66 are made available.80. Apart from coast defence and A.A. troops, the garrison of Malayaconsists at present of nine battalions and ancillary troops. Until the additionalair forces referred to in paragraph 66 can be stationed in the Far East, ourreconnaissance and striking forces available to deal with invasion or seaborneattack are seriously inadequate. The absence of these air forces will involve an increase in the existing land forces by an amount which the G.O.C. hasestimated as equivalent to three divisions and attached troops. This figure couldbe progressively reduced as the air reinforcements are increased. Since theG.O.C.&apos;s estimate was made the air forces in Malaya have already been increasedby one squadron and it is hoped to provide four additional squadrons by the endof this year.81. In present circumstances we are not in a position to find even one division from the United Kingdom or Middle East. Nor is India capable of doing so in view of her existing commitments. The only trained troops readily availablewho could be suitably equipped are those in Australia. We, therefore, recommendthat the Commonwealth Government be asked to provide the rough equivalent of one division and to equip it as far as possible.It may be found possible to make further forces available for the reinforce-ment of Malaya from some source at a later date. We therefore also recommendthat preparations should be set in train in Malaya to receive a second reinforcingdivision in addition to the one which it is hoped that the commonwealth government will provide.Anti-Aircraft.  -82. The provision of anti-aircraft guns for Singapore is well below the approved scale. The anti-aircraft requirements for the protection of air bases in Malaya, British Borneo and the Netherlands East Indies will need careful examination. It is not possible to state at this stage exactly what the total requirements will be.Fiji.83. We recommend . in . paragraph 46 that reinforcements should beheld available for despatch to Fiji.    The present garrison consists of the
1 equivalent of one company and one battery for Coast Defence, found by the FijiDefence Force (mixed European and Fijian). We recommend that the Goyern-ment of New Zealand should be approached with a view to earmarking a brigadefor this purpose.Naval Forces.84. Our forces on the China, Australia and New Zealand Stations consistat present of 1 8-inch Cruiser.2 Modern 6-inch Cruisers.4 Old 6-inch Cruisers.6 Armed Merchant Cruisers.5 Old Destroyers.3 A/S Escorts.8 M.T.Bs.These are entirely inadequate for a war in the Far East.85.   The Dutch forces in the Far East are : 2 Cruisers.7 Destroyers.16 Submarines.86. It is clear that, until the naval situation in European waters ismaterially improved, we may have to face a serious threat to our Far Easterntrade, as we shall be unable to make available adequate forces for its protection in the event of determined action against it by Japanese forces, particularly ifthey use heavy ships.87. In view of the foregoing considerations, it has become clear that wemust press on with our future naval construction programmes to the maximum extent possible; this is a long-term project and no naval building programme has ever allowed for a war in which we alone would be fighting Germany, Italyand Japan. Our best hope of being able to supply naval forces for the Far Eastin the near future lies in the possibility of early and successful action againstItalian naval forces in the Mediterranean.
