COPY NO,20th JULY, 1940cWAR CABINET.CUSTODY.OP PERSONS DETAINED UNDER DEFENCE REGULATION 18B,Memorandum &quot;by the Home SecretaryfeThere are at present in prisons in the United Kingdom about600 members of the British Union of Fascists who have been detainedunder Defence Regulation 18B(lA), and the question has been raised whether it would be desirable or practicable to transfer these people overseas.      In the consideration of this question attention should be given to the following points10    Whatever the decision on this question may be,it is proposed to transfer these men as soon as:possible to a camp where military guards couldbe providedc      This change is expedient bothon security grounds and also because it isdifficult to make arrangements in prison to givesuitable treatment to persons who are detained for preventive purposes only0      In prisonthe facilities for association are limited and. the men have to spend very long hours in theircells p.2,    Regulation 18B provides that every persondetained shall have a right to make objections toan Advisory committee       Most of these men havemade objections;, and for the purpose of hearingthese objections the Advisory Committee (ofwhich Mr0 Norman Birkett is Chairman) has been strengthened so that it can sit in four panels?each panel being under the Chairmanship of an experienced barrister0     As soon as the cases ofMosley and certain other leaders have been settled,the Committee hope to dispose rapidly of theremaining cases0      The hearing of these numerous&quot;cases willj however, take some weeks,     A number   sof the men concerned, allege that their association with the British Union ceased some time ago, or that it was slight, and that they had no intention
of engaging in any disloyal activitieso      In some cases they claim that they have done their &quot;best to help thecountry since the outbreak of war.     All these claims mujhe examined.      Although the intention was to intern only&apos;those who were organisers or were actively engaged in furthering the objects of the British Union, thepossibility that some mistakes may have been made cannotbe altogether excluded,, 13, There has been consultation with the Dominions Office an!the Colonial Office on the question where these people jcould be sent, if it were decided to send them&apos;overseas,!I am informed that in the case of the Dominions theposition is that the only Dominions which at the presentftime might be willing to accept these persons areAustralia and New Zealand, though ^bheir Governments! havjnot so far been approached^As regards the Colonies, enquiries were made&apos;some weeks ago of a number of Colonies as to the reception -of enemy;alien interneesj but I am informed that, with theexception of St. Helena, the available accommodation in jsuitable Colonies is urgently required for the reception&apos;of about 11,000 evacuees from Gibraltar,    ..r IProm a security point of view, St. Helena would be generally satisfactory, but there are considerablepractical difficulties in connection with the erection ofcamp accommodation (since the Island has no supply ofbuilding&apos;material or of skilled labour) and the provisionof watery food, fuel and other stores?  &apos;  While these difficulties could noldcraiteis be overcome, it is consideredthat it would bo several months before the necessary arrangements in st  .Helena could be completed,.,   &apos;&apos;-- It would also be necessary to provide a small military;guard for their escort on the voyage and for their oust:in the Island, but I understand that this would not presf!any difficulty *It would appear that in these circumstances the more practical proposition would be to send these men toAustralia or New Zealand if either of these Dominions woibe prepared to accept theme40 Before any persons detained, under the Defence Regulation!could be sent to a self-governing. Dominion legislation !would be necessary amending the Emergency Powers  (DefencfAct, 1939c.     This Act authorises the making of Regulation&quot;for the detention of persons whose detention appears to]the Secretary of State to be expedient in the Interests (public safety or the defence of the realm&quot; 0      Thisprovision contemplates. that the Secretary of State shoul&apos;answerable at all times for the detention of such person!)and if any of.them are to be sent to a self-governingDominion where they will be outside the jurisdiction of&apos;Secretary.of State, the express, authority of Parliament iibe obtained for this course,        - ..Such, legislation would probably not be uncontroversialo Alt&apos;no doubt an agreement -could be made with the Dominion that the Do:-Government would return to this country any persons whose return i;aolced for by the Secretary of State, such an agreement would not Wenforceable in law, and the effect of the proposed legislation woulto enable the Government of the United Kingdom to place Britishoutside the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom Courts and outside 1
control of the United Kingdom Government.     If persons detainedby an administrative order under Regulation 18B are placed inthe control of a Dominion Government, the United KingdomGovernment will have in law no control over their conditionsof detention, their treatment, or their release.JT.A.HOME OFFICE20th July, 1940,
