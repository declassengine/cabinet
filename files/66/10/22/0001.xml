The developments of the last few months have ledto a position where we have not sufficient troops for our requirements in all parts of the world,,     We have undertaken commitments in places as far apart as Icelandand the West indies.     There are indications that Japanintends to adopt a more aggressive policy, in face of whichwe may have to increase our forces in Malaya.     The Frencharmistice and the deterioration of the French Colonies hasincreased our difficulties in the Middle East, and at thesame time it has become more than ever important that weshould retain our position in this area.     In view of thescale of attack which may be developed by the Italians,with possible German co-operation, it is certain that theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, will require further reinforcements in the near future.     The period between now and May 19*4-1 may well be critical, and we are ofopinion that we shall require all the troops which Indiacan provide for service in this theatre,3. We understand that the Viceroy has recentlyexpressed the opinion that India could provide the troopsshown in Appendix &apos;A* at the dates shown therein.     while we would welcome the despatch of these formations, weshould like to make it clear that we do not consider thatthe forces which India will by then have provided shouldbe regarded as the total which will eventually be required from her.     We are at present engaged on an appreciationto Indicate our views on the general policy for theconduct of the war, and we believo that as a result itwill become apparent that we shall have to call, upon thewhole Empire to make its maximum contribution in man power.Pending the completion of this appreciation we estimate that not less than the equivalent of nine divisions willin all be required from India including those troopsalready despatched or earmarked and those shown inAppendix ,At.     This would entail raising a further three divisions and these should be ready, the first by August19*4-1, the other two by the end of that year.1-

In the meantime we wish to point out that completeBrigade Groups j if India could raise the additionalartillery units required, would be of greater value than the formation shown in.Appendix &quot;A1.     Mountainartillery units would be acceptable in place of fieldartillery, in the proportion of 1 to 2, in these BrigadeGroups.     The field regiment already offered (in Appendix&apos;A&apos;) should be provided on a horsed basis.Li, Equipment remains the major difficulty.     Weconsider that no troops should be sent overseas to fight against a first class enemy unless equipped to the fullscale laid down for External Defence Troops (E.D.T.).Y/hile we rely on India to provide as much of the necessary material as she herself produces, we suggest that his majesty&apos;s Government undertakes to provide the fullE.D.T. scales of all articles of home or foreign supply.We cannot at this stage say when this will be possible.For the next few months full priority must be given tothe vital requirements of Home Defence.     During thisperiod little or no equipment can be spared for overseas and the completion of any Indian unit at all before september will probably not be possible.     We hope towardsthe end of the year the threat bf invasion will have passed and it will be possible to start building up our field army once again.     The rate at which we cansend equipment overseas will depend on the wastageincurred during the intervening period, on the damageinflicted on our industry by enemy attack, and upon therate at which we can draw supplies from the United Statesof America.     It would be our object to provide the equipment required for all units in Appendix &apos;A! by april, 191+1, or as soon after aa possible.5.        There will, however, be occasions on which troops from India on a lower scale of equipment would be valuable;   for example, for internal security or L. of C.duties, thereby relieving better equipped troops fromthese duties.     It must, of course, be realised thatIndian troops sent overseas so equipped would have toaccept the risk of becoming involved in serious fighting,in the same way as the three British divisions which were sent to France for labour duties early this year werelater involved in active operations.6.        Meanwhile we wish to ensure that as soon asequipment is available there will be trained men to use it.We must, therefore, plan the most favourable equipmentsituation, even though this may not materialise.     we recognise that by doing so a situation may be created in which strong pressure may develop for the despatchoverseas of formations inadequately equipped.     this situation, however, already faces British and Dominionforces in other theatres.     The present scale of equipment of the forces in Appendix &apos;A* will be takeninto consideration if they are called upon to proceedoverseas before it is possible to complete them to E.D.T.scales.     We, therefore, suggest that India should beasked to prepare and replace forces for overseas service to provide fbr the most favourable equipment situationin the same way as we ourselves and the Dominions are doing.     Training scales of weapons, (e.g. mortars,A/T. rifles etc.)  which do not form part of the equipment of units in India, should be provided from home at the earliest possible date.

7* The Secretary of State for India also asks to be advised as to the extent to which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment wish prcrision of these forces to take precedence over any preparation to assist Afghanistan.We consider that as the likelihoood of hostilities withRussia has for the present decreased,, our requirements in the Middle East must take precedence over any plans for assistance to Afghanistan? and that any units whichIndia can provide must be regarded as overseas commitments which will require to be replaced in India.     Once units have been trained and equipped it should be possible,without   difficulty, to divert them to Afghanistan at alater stage if the situation should have materiallyaltered.     In deciding what units can be sent overseasit is realised that the Government   of India must continue at all times to maintain adequate forces for the defenceof the North West Frontier and for internal security.8, One further consideration is shipping.     We areat present suffering from lack of suitable merchantvessels and even more from a shortage of naval escorts.Shipping programmes are prepared as far ahead as possible,but we have to accept the fact that some moves offormations overseas nay be held up.     We do not, however,consider that this possibility justifies any delay in preparing forces for despatch,9. To sum up:-(a) We recommend that we should ask the Governmentof India to prepare and replace the followingunits for sex-vice overseas5-1 Brigade Group - bjr the end of July, 19U01 Brigade Group - by the end of September, 192+01 Motor Cavalry Brigade - by the end of January,19416 Infantry Brigade Groups - by May 19hl(if the Artillery and Ancillary troops for theseBrigade groups cannot be found, the infantry brigades should be prepared without them.     Thefield artillery regiment offered can be acceptedon a horsed basis0     If the provision of driversand technical personnel presents no difficulty,the first line transport of all infantry brigadesshould be on M.T. basis and early steps should betaken to provide the necessary vehicles.)(b) We consider, that in principle, forces requiredto fight a first class enemy should be equipped to E.D,T. scale.     Forces sent overseas to carryout internal security or L. of G. duties or to a theatre where a first class enemy is unlikely tobe met, may be equipped to the highest scale which India herself can provide.     We suggestthat His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake toprovide all equipment reqtiired from United kingdom or foreign sources up to full S.D.T. scale andalso to replace all such equipment that hasalready been suuplied to forces overseas by india from her own stocks.     This should be completed by April, 19hl, or as soon as possible after thatdate, taking into account our responsibility in other parts of the world,/^Training scales of weapons (e.g0 Mortars,A/T rifles, etc.)  should be sent to Indiaan and when such envipwnts become i *-hle.

(c) We recommend that the Government of India should&quot;be&apos; informed that, in addition to forces alreadyearmarked in India and the forces mentioned inAppendix 1 A&apos;, His Majesty&apos;.s Government anticipatehaving to request the preparation of further forcesamounting to three divisions, the first by August,19*4-1, and. the other two by the end of that yeai&quot;.(d) We consider that for the present Middle Eastrequirements take precedence over all plans forassistance to Afghanistan.      In any case such assistance should be limited to the forward move to Jalalabad - Kandahar.      It is recognised thatthe despatch of forces overseas from India mustbe dependent upon the retention in India of adequate forces for the defence of the North west frontier and for internal security.(Signed)    R.E.G.

(G) (40) 137of 23rd May, 1940) designed to provide by the Spring of1941 the forces required to support Afghanistan in theevent of Soviet aggression^ without interference with theforces earmarked as mentioned above for service overseas.In this telegram 1045 the Government of India intimatedtheir readiness for the new forces raised under this expansion scheme being used overseas in 1941 in the- eventof Soviet aggression not materialising-,3. Upon the entry of Italy into the war the Viceroy was asked*what forces.? over and above those already earmarked,he could release for overseas in an emergency and on theassumption that assistance to Afghanistan was not necessary at the time     The Viceroy has replied^that the followingforces could be released at the times stated:-(a) Ready to embark by end of July, 1940 cOne Infantry Brigade (with mechanised transport).One Field Regiment (horsed) - (If requiredmechanised this would not be available until december, 1940.One Mountain Battery   (J?ack Transport).(b) Ready to. eirobark^ in Auguat, 1940*Two Field Companies - Sappers and Miners.+   Personal telegram 740 of 14/6 (Annex I).^   Viceroy?s telegram 1029-S of 21/6 (Annex II).

(c) Ready to embark &quot;by end, of September, 1940.One Infantry Brigade (with mechanised transport).(d) Ready to embark in Decembery 1940.One Field Regiment (Mechanised) - (If notrequired as a horsed Regiment in July).Two Field Companies - Sappers and Miners.(e) Ready to embark by end of January, 1941.One Uotor Cavalry Brigade equipped with trucks.(f) Roady to ^eiubark^^n^April, 1941.One Infantry Brigade (with mechanised transport).Five Infantry Brigades (with animal transport).If required, therefore, and provided the Soviet threat to Afghanistan does not materialise, India could send over-seas between July 1940 and April 1941, in addition to the division earmarked, for Iraq/Iran mentioned in paragraph 1:-1 Cavalry Brigade (equipped with trucks).8 Infantry Brigades.1 Field Regiment01 Mountain Battery^4 Field Companies - Sappers and Miners.These forces, though considerable, are extremely weak inartillery and the infantry and cavalry units would only have 80 and 35 automatic weapons respectively and probablyno mortars or anti-tank rifles.It must be emphasised, moreover, that these troopsform an integral part of the forces upon which India reliesshould it be necessary to afford support to Afghanistan.4. The present situation makes it almost inevitable that by the Spring of 194-1, His Majesty&apos;s Government willnot be able to supply the air forces and anti-aircraft and anti-tank artillery which form an essential part of thePlan for supporting the Afghan Government in Kabul. &apos;   Itis for consideration, therefore, whether we should not nowdefinitely accept the position that we cannot undertakelarge scale operations against the Soviet in Afghanistan.The Government of India, however, must maintain adequateforces for the defence of India whose security is vitallyaffected by conditions in Afghanistan which may be upsetnot only by Soviet action but also by German and Italianintrigues.     It would be desirable that such forces shouldon a scale which will enable them to carry out a forwardmove to Jalalbad and if possible to Kandahar should the needarise.     This in fact is the interim plan recommended by theGovernment of India for the suppc  \ of Afghanistan up tothe Spring of 1941, as a result of the conclusions reached in War Cabinet Paper No, w.P.(40) 179 of 29th May, 1940-.The object would, be to control tribal areas and to denyground in close proximity to the frontier to possible enemy occupation.     But in the last resort even these more limited measures of precaution might have to be postponedto the more urgent demands of the military situation in theMiddle East.*   Government of India telegram 1458 of .24/6 (Annex 111).*-

5. Tlie Government of India calculate that, providedno troops,  other than those already earmarked for Ira.q/lranand Burma, are sent overseas before 1941, they should beable to undertake an advance to Jalalabad, but an advance to Kandahar would be dependent on the situation and theprogress of their present expansion, programme.     Plans onthis basis are now being prepared in India.It is clear, therefore, that if any of the troops now offered by the Viceroy a)ce sent overseas this yeareven limited assistance to Afghanistan before the spring of 1941 will be impossible unless steps are taken now toreplace them.6. If His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to earmark any moreforces for overseas, and the situation in the Middle Eastand Iraq, and possible developments in the Par Eastindicate that further trained forces from India may be needed at any moment, then it is essential that theGovernment of India should be asked to commence raisingtheir replacement now.     The shortage of artillery inIndia and the time required to train technical troops makeit Very desirable that any request for further troops shouldnot be restricted to immediate requirements but should givea forecast which will enable the Government of India to plan ahead.7. The Government of India in their telegram 1046 of18th May have said that their present expansion programme will absorb all their resources until May 1941.     This istaken to refer to equipment rather than to their ability to raise and train personnel.     It should be realised,therefore, that any further expansion in India - at anyrate until such time as it may be possible to bringabout a substantial increase, both in quantity and inrange, of India&apos;s own capacity to provide equipment -will be largely dependent on the supply of equipment byHis Majesty&apos;s Government and that unless this is forth-coming only limited and ill equipped forces are likely tobe available;     Thus it is important that any request for troops should be accompanied by an indication of thescale at which they should be equipped so that theGovernment of India can give an eavly estimate of the equipment which His Majesty&apos;s Government must provide.8. It is understood that the division for Iraq/Iranwill be moved in the near future and it is consideredthat, if further troops are likely to be required thereor elsewhere the Government of India should be informednow.(a) what further troops His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould like them to prepare for service overseas this year and when they should beprepared to move:(b) what troops His Majestyrs Government wouldlike them to prepare for service overseasby, say, May 1941*

CYPHER TELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY OP state to VICEROY LATED Ikth JUFE,  1940;ORE T.JUO, Personal;     You will idealise that in planning to meet rapidly changing situation War Office arefrequently forced to consider at Short notice the need to reinforce certain localities in Middle East and thattheir resources in troops  and equipment are limited.They are reluctant to divert TRCUT or to call on itsunits piecemeal and consideration of problem here isdifficult as I am not in a position to say at airy momentwhether any particular force is likely to be available if required and. could he spared, without interference withTROUT or HERRING.      Questions which arise are often tootentative to justify specific question to you regardingavailability but prompt decision would be much simplifiedif I were able to say at once whether forces requiredcould be supplied from India subject to conditions rulingat the time.I realise that expansion proposed in yourtelegram 101+S May 18 is primariljr for Soviet threat andwill not be fully effective until Spring 1941.      Alsothat Soviet aggression would absorb ail your resourcesexcept your commitments in Iraq/Iran,      In presentcircumstances however I feel that more immediate and vital,request for Indian troops overseas may arise at any moment and it would, be of greatest assistance toHis Majesty&apos;s Government if you could tell me no., whatforces in addition to TROUT you could spare in realemergency from your existing resources in men andequipment for service outside India specifying the periodrequired to have them ready for embarkation and the approximate scale of equipment and transport they could take.     Your information would be of most value in termsof brigade groups on lines of K3 end any other individualunits.In rfaking this enquiry I am not suggesting angrfurther expansion beyond that proposed in your 10i;.5 and I fully realise your equipment difficulties.      Actualrequests for the despatch of any force you may he able tooffer would of course be made at the time in the ordinary,way and would be subject to acceptance of the Soviet riskat that time.     His Majesty&apos;s Government would endeavourto provide equipment for any forces sent overseas but atpresent juncture there is small Tjr-ospect of such assistance owing to B.E.P.  requirements.If you are able to offer forces apart from valueof early information to H,M. G.  it is&apos; suggested, thatexamination now of training and. equipment problems involved would do much to speed, despatch of any forces II.M.G. may require.

ANNEX IIto War Staff.DECYPHER OF TELEGRAM,From Viceroy to Secretary of State for india dated        Simla, 23.55 hours, 20th June, 1940.Received   01.30 hours, 21st dune, 1940.1029-S. Personal.      Your telegram 740 dated 14th June,part I       Before answering your views as to what forces inEdition to Trout we can spare in a real emergency, I feel itInecessary to make the following point clear.(a) Up to date, we have concentrated primarily on Trout(? toeing) (? got) ready to proceed overseas when asked for.? at present) we are only just beginning to provide unit( s not)lin Trout with vehicles as and when they become available.(b) The present expansion of the Indian Army in which weIare engaged is being carried out by the withdrawing from existingunits (? trained) personnel to form new units in order to obtainthe maximum efficiency in the shortest time possible.(c) All units, therefore, are at present in a transitionpstage for at least the next 3 months during which the necessaryItraining of personnel in driving vehicles is being carried outlas rapidly as possible.     This applies not only (? to) infantryput to artillery, engineers, signals, medical and transport units,which take even longer to get ready.art 2.     In the light of above explanation we estimate that troops shown below could be made available in an emergency from&amp;ates specified subject to conditions ruling at the time and provided the vehicles and certain items of equipment, eg.  signaland medical, which we hope to be able to get, are to hand.Instead of showing troops available by brigade groups,we have shown infantry brigades separately with a pool of unitsIjof other arms available as shown which could be drawn on for&quot;attachment to certain infantry brigades if necessary.     In thisconnection we presume that if we are called upon to despatch anyof these troops, they will form part of some existing higherformation which will have the necessary organisation for their administration and maintenance.They will be:    Infantry (a) 1 infantry brigade.Headquarters, 3 Indian infantry battalions, signal section and field ambulance.     All mechanised with second line M.T. which,however, will not, repeat not, be on home organisation basis.Re&amp;dy to embark end of July, 1940.fa) One Infantry Brigade,     As in (a) above.     Ready to embark late September, 1940.      (c)    One Infantry Brigade.     Asf1 (a) above but less field ambulance.      Ready to embarkApril, 1941    (d) 5 Infantry Brigades.     As in (a) above but less-fromambulances and all on animal transport basis. Ready to embarkApril, 1941.    Note:    As far as can be foreseen at present, all

above Infantry Battalions will have only 6 (half of 12) mediummachine guns and 14 (half of 28) light (? machine) guns each.B.   Other arms,  (a)   motor Cavalry Brigade in trucks.     Completeas far as possible (?including) field ambulance.     Ready to embark end of January, 1941.     Each regiment with 35 (half of 70)light machine guns only.

ANNEX III.Allotted to. War Staff. 4915.flopv to General Muspratt.nnpy to Mr.. Walton and Political Dept.DEGYPHBR OF TELEGRAM.From     Government of India, Defence department i toSecretary of State for India.Dated    Simla,  02.55 hours,  25th June,  1940.Received 03.40 hours, 25th June, 1940.IMMEDIATE. _1458.    24/6.      Your telegram No.  2723, 3rd June.     Wehave given full consideration to possibility of preparingan interim plan to carry out objects of plan as   givenin my telegrams 1015 and 1016, 15th May and 1046, 18thMay,We have come to definite conclusion that plan as therein detailed (? is the) only feasible one whichcould afford some practical support to Afghan Governmentin the event of Soviet armed aggression.      But as inpresent circumstances we cannot expect to obtain essentialassistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery and as land forcesrequire implements plan cannot be ready until April1941 whole plan in interim period&quot;at any rate falls tothe   ground.2. In spite of grave situation elsewhere however itappears to us that the danger of Soviet armed aggressionhas largely receded at any rate for the present.    On theother hand we consider there is definite danger of internaldisintegration of Afghanistan in v/hich 5th Columnactivities by our enemies will play a considerable part.This may well lead, to collapse of Afghan Government at anytime during interim period referred to above.3. Immediate problem therefore is how to meet such a situation which will inevitably create for us trouble inour own tribal areas and on both sides of the Durand Line.There appears to be following two possibilities - (a)disintegration of Afghanistan without any Soviet (? or other)armed intervention.    (b) Similar situation in Afghanistancoupled with Soviet or other armed action to take advantageof our difficulties.       In the case of (a) and taking allpresent circumstances into consideration it might bewisest revert to defensive policy on our western Frontier.But as possibility of (b) cannot be disregarded we considerwe should at least push forward beyond our frontier withobject before it facilitating control of tribal areas anddenying ground in close proximity to our&apos;frontier to possible enemy occupation^

1I 2-This advance would be, however,  limited to Jalalabad areaIf the North and Kandahar area in the South.&apos; Jalalabad provided, no further forces, aprat fromm required to be (? placed.) at the disposal of Hi .L^wia Government for service overseas before theeiajsstyna ofRave toWe consider, definitely, we can undertake advanceTrout,sGovernment for service overseas before thehis year.      Advance to Kandahar, however, wouldbe dependent on the situation at the time andgr.ess made in our expansion.We propose therefore to prepare interim plan on;he lines of above at once.      This will include&quot; examinationjf possibility of actively enlisting goodwill of our ownpfoes particularly those in around Jalalabad and KandaharUreas.     We would add that effectiveness of this olantoi\l6. be greatly enhanced if some additional assistanceould be given to us in the way of aircraft and anti-lircraf t artillery.      If however this Is not   possible whenIjnd if the ti. e comes we are prepared to talee&quot; the riskith the assistance which very limited air forces at ourisposal can give.
