WEAPON AT DOVER.IN accordance with the instructions of the Prime Minister, the following-report is submitted on the recent experience at Dover with the U.P. NavalWeapon against hostile aircraft.2. There have been two occasions during attacks by enemy aircraft on DoverHarbour when the U.P. weapons have been brought into action. On the first occasion, at 2-25 p.m. on the 4th July, a single Heinkel bomber appeared out ofthe clouds from the north-east of the harbour flying at a height of approximately2,000 feet. This bomber was engaged by two projectors mounted on the eastside of the harbour, and a full salvo of 40 rounds was fired. The majority of therounds functioned correctly, the barrage being laid in time, and the aeroplaneflew through the barrage and appeared to set off two bombs. It turned away from the harbour, went into a gliding dive and was last seen very low over thewater on its way home. The impression of those observing was that theaeroplane had been damaged by the barrage, but there can be no certainty onthe point.3. The second raid took place at 7-36 a.m. on the 29th July, and took theform of a massed dive-bombing attack in two waves of 16 and 22 Junkers 87bombers. The attack was carried out from N.E. to S.W., and the aircraft started to dive from a height of approximately 4,000 feet to heights of between 500 feetand 1,000 feet.In this raid the tactics of use of the U.P. weapons were altered on the basisof previous experience, and it was arranged to put up a barrage placed in sucha way that as far as possible the aircraft would be forced to fly through it aftercompleting their dives and while making for home. Five projectors were used,arranged in two batteries : (a) three projectors mounted on the western sideof the harbour, and (b) two projectors mounted on the eastern side. It was notpossible to cover the whole front of the harbour with this arrangement, but itwas the best that could be done with the number of projectors available. Onesalvo was fired from each of the five projectors, making a total of 100 rounds.It was not possible to get the barrage up quickly enough to catch the first six of the raiders in the first wave, but the remainder had to face it and takewhat avoiding action they could. By swerving hard to port several aircraftmanaged to pass through the gap in the barrage, but the rest were unable to manage this manoeuvre successfully and were forced to pass through either theif) or the (b) curtain. One of the four bombers passing through the (a) curtainwas seen to become entangled and was brought down. It appears probable thatthe crash of this bomber was caused by the U.P. barrage, but this cannot be stated definitely as no explosion was observed. Another bomber was entangledin the (b) curtain, and an explosion took place in the machine when flying[21595]
approximately at the height of the cliffs behind the harbour. The descriptiongiven by the observer (Capt. Jarman, R.A.) in my opinion leaves no room fordoubt that in this case the aircraft was definitely destroyed by the U.P.4. Summarising the foregoing, the position appears to be that in the two main engagements it is certain that the U.P. weapon destroyed one bomber,probable that it destroyed a second, and possible that it destroyed or crippleda third.5. All the relevant reports on the subject were made available to me, andin addition I visited Dover and interviewed the officers concerned, and was shown the disposition of the weapons. I should like to record my appreciation of thecourtesy shown to me, and of the desire of all concerned to give me all possiblehelp to enable me to compile this account.August 4, 1940.(Signed)A. D.
