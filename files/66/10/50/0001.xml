MOST SECRET.ANNEX I.Defence against Invasion.Minute by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.BEARING in mind the immense cost in war energy and disadvantage of attempting to defend the whole west coast of Great Britain, and the dangers ofbeing unduly committed to systems of passive defence, I should be glad if thefollowing notes could be borne in mind : 1. Our first line of defence against invasion must be as ever the enemy&apos;sports. Air reconnaissance, submarine watching, and other means of obtaining information should be followed by resolute attacks with all our forces available and suitable upon any concentrations of enemy shipping.2. Our second line of defence is the vigilant patrolling of the sea to intercept any invading expedition, and to destroy it in transit.3. Our third line is the counter-attack upon the enemy when he makes anylandfall, and particularly while he is engaged in the act of landing. this attack, which has long been ready from the sea, must be reinforced by Air action;and both sea and air attacks must be continued so that it becomes impossible forthe invader to nourish his lodgments.4. The land defences and the home Army are maintained primarily for thepurpose of making the enemy come in such large numbers as to afford a propertarget to the sea and air forces above mentioned, and to make hostile preparationsand movements noticeable to Air and other forms of reconnaissance.5. However, should the enemy succeed in landing at various points, heshould be made to suffer as much as possible by local resistance on the beaches,combined with the aforesaid attack from the sea and the air. This forces himto use up his ammunition, and confines him to a limited area. The defence ofany part of the coast must be measured not by the forces on the coast, but by thenumber of hours within which strong counter-attacks by mobile troops can bebrought to bear upon the landing places. Such attacks should be hurled withthe utmost speed and fury upon the enemy at his weakest moment, which is not,as is sometimes suggested, when actually getting out of his boats, but when
k 9 0sprawled upon the shore with his communications cut and his supplies runningshort. It ought to be possible to concentrate 10,000 men fully equipped within six hours, and 20,000 men within twelve hours, upon any point where a seriouslodgment has been effected. The withholding of the reserves until the full gravity of the attack is known is a nice problem for the Home Command.6. It must be admitted that the task of the Navy and Air Force to preventinvasion becomes more difficult in the narrow seas, namely, from the Wash toDover. This sector of the coast front is also nearest to the supreme enemyobjective, London. The sector from Dover to Lands End is far less menacedbecause the Navy and Air Force must make sure that no mass of shipping, still less protecting warships, can be passed into the French Channel ports. Atpresent the scale of attack on this wide front is estimated by the Admiralty at no more than 5,000 men. Doubling this for greater security, it should be possibleto make good arrangements for speedy counter-attack in superior numbers, andat the same time to achieve large economies of force on this southern sector inwhich the beach troops should be at their minimum and the mobile reserves attheir maximum. These mobile reserves must be available to move to the south-eastern sectors at short notice. Evidently this situation can only be judged fromweek to week.7. When we come to the west coast of Britain, a new set of conditions rules.The enemy must commit himself to the broad seas, and there will be plenty oftime, if his approach is detected, to attack him with cruisers and flotillas. TheAdmiralty dispositions still conform to this need. The enemy has at present nowarships to escort him. Should we, for instance, care to send 12,000 menunescorted in merchant ships Mo land on the Norwegian coast, or in the Skagerrakand Kattegat, in face of superior sea power and air power ? It would be thoughtmadness.8. However, to make assurance triply sure, the Admiralty should pursue their plan of laying a strong minefield from Cornwall to Ireland, covering the bristol Channel and the Irish Sea from southward attack. This minefield is allthe more necessary now that by the adoption of the Northabout route forcommerce we have transferred a large part of our patrolling craft from theWestern Approaches which have become permanently more empty and unwatched.9. The establishment of this minefield will simplify and mitigate all questions of local defence north of its point of contact with Cornwall. We must consider this sector from Cornwall to the Mull of Cantyre as the least vulnerable to seaborne invasion. Here the works of defence should be confined to guardingby a few guns or land torpedo tubes the principal harbours, and giving a moderatescale of protection to their gorges. It is not admissible to lavish our limited resources upon this sector.10. North of the Mull of Cantyre to Scapa Flow, the Shetlands and the faroes all lies in the orbit of the main Fleet. The voyage of an expedition fromthe Norwegian coast would be very hazardous, and its arrival anywhere right[21648]
round to Cromarty Firth would not raise immediately decisive issues. The enemywho is now crouched, would then be sprawled. His advance would lie in difficult and sparsely-inhabited country. He could be contained until sufficient forces were brought to bear, and his communications immediately cut from the sea. Thiswould make his position all the more difficult, as the distances to any importantobjective are much longer and he would require considerable wheeled transport.It would be impossible to fortify all landing points in this sector, and itwould be a waste of energy to attempt to do so. A much longer period may beallowed for counter-attack than in the south-east opposite London.11. From Cromarty Firth to the Wash is the second-most important sector,ranking next after the Wash to Dover. Here, however, all the harbours and inletsare defended, both from the sea and from the rear, and it should be possible to counter-attack in superior force within twenty-four hours. The Tyne must beregarded as the second major objective after London, for here (and to a lesser extent at the Tees) grievous damage could be done by an invader or large-scaleraider in a short time. On the other hand, the sea and air conditions are morefavourable to us than to the southward.12. The combined Staffs should endeavour to assign to all these sectors their relative scales of vulnerability and defence, both in the number of men employedin the local defence of beaches and of harbours, and also in the number of days or hours within which heavy counter-attacks should be possible. As an indication of these relative scales of attack and defence, I set clown for consideration thefollowing : Cromarty Firth to Wash inclusive        ...      ...      ... -   3Wash to Dover promontory        ...       ...       ...       ...       5Dover promontory to Lands End, and round to start ofminefield ...       ...      ...       ...      ...      ...      1^Start of the minefield to the Mull of Cantvre    ...      .. 4-Mull of Cantyre north-about to Cromarty Firth      ...        iW. S. C.August 5, 1940.
9 E* 0(* d *jANNEX II.Defence against Invasion.Prime Minister,THE Chiefs of Staff have examined, in consultation with the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, your Minute* and find themselves in complete agreementwith the principles enunciated in paragraphs 1 to 5.2. The Commander-in-Chief assures us that the paramount importance of immediate counter-attack upon the enemy, should he obtain a temporary footingon these shores, has been impressed on all ranks, and, that it is his policy to bring back divisions into reserve as soon as they are adequately trained and equipped for offensive operations.3. The Chiefs of Staff also agree with your assessment of the relative scales of vulnerability to seaborne attack of the various sectors of the coast. Indeed, itis remarkable how closely the present distribution of Home Defence Divisionscorresponds with your figures in paragraph 12.   This is worked out as follows.4.   Your theoretical scales of defence are : Cromarty Firth to Wash ...Wash to DoverDover to North Cornwall ...North Cornwall to Mull of Canty reMull of Cantyre to Cromarty Firth35i412Total1015. A force of 10 Divisions, if distributed in the above proportions, wouldgive three Divisions on Sector Forth-Wash, five Divisions on Sector Wash-Doverand so on. There are, in fact, 26 active Divisions in this Island, and, if yourfigures are multiplied by 2 - 6 and compared with actual distribution of these26 Divisions, the following picture results :  Distribution inSector.Cromarty-WashWash-Dover  ...Dover-North CornwallNorth Cornwall-Mull of CantyreMull of Cantyre-Cromartyaccordance withPrime Ministersassessment ofvulnerability.&apos; 212Vx2nActualDistributionof Divisions.8*7-105-82* Annex 1.
6. The similarity between the two sets of figures is even closer than appearsat first sight, by reason of the fact that the reserve divisions located immediatelyNorth and North-West of London are available for deployment in either the sector Wash-Dover or the sector Dover-Portsmouth, and therefore the numberof &quot; available &quot; divisions for these two sectors is variable. A total of 15 divisionsis available on the combined sectors against your suggested requirements of 16f.7. The Chiefs of Staff point out that your figures are based on scales ofseaborne attack, whereas the actual distribution takes into account the threatfrom airborne attack as well. Thus although we may seem, at present, to be slightly over-insured along the South coast, the reason for this is that our defencesthere can be brought under the enemy fighter &quot; umbrella &quot; and can be subjected to assault across the Channel at comparatively short range.(Signed) L. C. HOLLIS, Secretary,Chiefs of Staff Committee.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,August 13, 1940.
