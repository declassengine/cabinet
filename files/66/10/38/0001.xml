NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.THE principal features of enemy activity at sea have been the operations of u-Boats in the Northern Approaches, aircraft mine-laying by night on the Eastand West Coasts, and air attack on coastal shipping on the South Coast.British naval forces have been active in both the Eastern and western mediterranean.Home Waters.2. On the 2nd August H.M. trawler Cape Finisterre, off St. Albans Head,was bombed and sunk by four enemy aircraft, one of which was shot down.On the 4th August H.M.S. Berwick, on passage to Scapa, was in collisionin a thick fog and sustained damage above the water line. On the same dayH.M. trawlers Oswaldian, in the Bristol Channel, Drummer, off Bright!ingsea.and Marsona, outside Cromarty Firth, were mined and sunk. HM. drifterThora shot down an enemy aircraft suspected of mine-laying off the Humber.On the night of the 4th August, 20 miles south of the Isle of Wight, H.M.trawler Chrysoberyl engaged an E-boat, which retired under cover of a smokescreen. On the 5th August HM. trawler River Clyde was mined and sunk offAldeburgh.On the 7th August the S.S. Mohamed All Kebir (7,527 tons), with732 military and naval details, was torpedoed and sunk off the north-west coast of Ireland.   600 suiwivors, including 35 wounded, were rescued.HM. Submarines Thames and Spearfish are overdue and must be presumed lost. A German broadcast claimed that a U-Boat had successfully attacked thelatter off the Norwegian Coast.Mediterranean.3. The British force in the Western Mediterranean has been employed incovering the landing of Hurricane aircraft at Malta from H.M.S. Argus, whichwas carried out successfully on the 2nd August. On the previous day the ships were unsuccessfully attacked by enemy aircraft, one of which was shot down bySkuas and another hit by anti-aircraft fire.Early on the 2nd August Cagliari aerodrome was successfully attacked bythe Fleet Air Arm and 3 mines were laid in the entrance to the outer harbour.Heavy anti-aircraft fire was experienced and 2 of our aircraft were lost. one enemy seaplane was shot down.A force of cruisers and destroyers from Alexandria has carried out a sweepin the aegean to cover movements of shipping in the Eastern Mediterranean, and3 destroyers have been operating off thecOast of Palestine.H.M. Submarine Oswald is overdue and must be presumed lost. An Italiancommunique claimed that the Italian destroyer Vivaldi had rammed and sunkthe Oswald on the 1st August and had saved 52 of the crew.Anti-Submarine Operations.4. In Home Waters a total of 15 attacks have been carried out on U-Boats,of which 10 were by aircraft. Of the latter, attacks in positions 40 miles north-west of Tory Island on the 2nd, 50 miles east-south-east of Sumbrugh Head onthe 3rd, and 80 miles north of Cape Wrath on the 4th August,&apos; probably inflicteddamage. The attacks by naval vessels included two by Dutch submarinesoperating in the North Sea, both of which were unsuccessful.Anti-submarine sweeps were carried out by pairs of destroyers in the NorthMinch, East of Shetlands and south-westward of Scilly Isles without result.In the Red Sea, during an attack on the 4th August on the port of Massawa,2 bombs were dropped between 2 Italian U-Boats lying 60 yards apart and itis thought that considerable damage was caused. In another attack on Massawacarried out on the 6th August a direct hit with a 250-lb. bomb was obtained ona U-boat, but no further details have yet been received.
Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.5. U-Boats have concentrated their attack on shipping off the north-westcoast of Ireland, where, during the week, 2 British (12,516 tons) and 3 neutral ships (8,523 tons) have been sunk, and 1 Norwegian and 4 British ships damaged.Included in the latter were 3 tankers, which were torpedoed but succeeded in reaching port under escort in a damaged condition.The Yugoslavian S.S. Rad (4,201 tons) was sunk by a U-Boat to the westward of Portuguese Guinea and the Greek S.S. Rotda (1,044 tons) south ofCrete. Although enemy minelaying from aircraft has persisted throughout theweek, only one ship, the British S.S.Wychtvood (2,794 tons), was lost. She strucka mine off Harwich.6. Enemy aircraft caused little damage to merchant shipping during theweek until a series of attacks in force were made on the westbound Channelconvoy on the 8th August, resulting in the loss of 2 ships and 2 balloon tugssunk, and 8 ships and 2 balloon tugs damaged. The same convoy was attacked by E-boats on the night of the 7th/8th August, two ships being sunk and onedamaged. On the 1st August convoys on the East Coast were repeatedly attacked,but only one ship was damaged. On the same evening, off Montrose, the british.S. Highlander was attacked unsuccessfully by two aircraft, both of which sheshot down. On the 2nd August the British S.S. City of Brisbane (8,006 tons) was bombed and sunk in the Thames Estuary.On the 3rd August the Clyde-Methil convoy was bombed off Cape Wrath...One British ship was set on fire and subsequently towed into Stornoway.On the 5th August an attempted attack by a large number of enemy aircraft on the eastbound Channel convoy escorted by a mobile balloon barrage wasfrustrated by our fighters.  Details of shipping losses are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.7. 868 ships, including 120 Allied and 36 Neutral, were convoyedduring the week ending noon the 7th August, of which 3 ships were lost by enemy action. One cruiser, 8 armed merchant cruisers, 22 destroyers, 16 sloopsand 14 corvettes were employed on escort duties. Losses of ships in convoy due to enemy action have been steadily increasing during the last three months. during may only 1 ship was lost out of 3,430 convoyed; during June 8 ships out of 3,387were lost, and during July 29 ships out of 4,147. Total losses in convoy since thecommencement of hostilities are 61 British, 8 Allied and 4 Neutral, making atotal of 73 ships out of 30,877 convoyed.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy amounted to 1,161,638 tons, ascompared with 741,560 tons during the previous week. Twenty-eight tankersbrought 308,588 tons of fuel oil. Mineral imports totalled 311,339 tons, of which242,621 tons were steel, scrap iron and iron ore. Cereal imports were 189,478tons. Other food imports included 47,568 tons of sugar, 19,158 tons of refrigeratedand tinned meat and 7,562 tons of fresh, dried and tinned fruits. There were840 tons of wine from South Africa, 84 tons from Australia and 395 tons of rumfrom the West Indies.Enemy Intelligence.Germany. \8. The position of the main units of the German Fleet on the 4th Augustwas as follows : the battle-cruisers Gneisenau and Scharnhorst, the pocket battle-ship Lutzow and the 6-inch cruiser Koln were all in dock at Kiel. One 8-inch cruiser was lying. alongside in the same port. The battleships Tir-pitz willhelmshaven, Bismarck at Hamburg and the cruiser Seydlitz at Bremen are stillcompleting. One pocket battleship, one 8-inch cruiser, three 6-inch cruisers andan aircraft carrier are unaccounted for, but it is believed that two of the 6-inch cruisers are still repairing.Six or seven U-boats have been operating off the north-west coast of Ireland.Italy.9.   The only known movement of Italian ships in the period under reviewis contained in the report of H.M. Submarine Oswald which observed 1 cruiser&apos; [21621] B
of the &quot; Bande Neri &quot; class followed a few hours later by 4 cruisers (whether8-inch or 6-inch is uncertain) with destroyers passing northwards through theStraits of Messina on the 1st August. Air reconnaissance on the 6th Augustshowed only destroyers and merchantmen in Sicilian ports.Enemy Merchant Shipping.Germany.10. Up to date 70 German merchant ships, totalling 383,997 tons, havebeen sunk or scuttled, 58, totalling 259,167 tons, have been captured and 55unidentified ships of 275,000 tons have been reported sunk by submarines and aircraft. The total number of merchant ships lost to Germany is therefore 183ships of 918,164 tons.The tanker Nordmeer (5,646 tons) is reported to have sailed from Vigo onthe 1st August. It was reported that the Kreta (2,359 tons) had been torpedoed and sunk on the 8th April in the entrance to Oslo Fjord. Lloyd&apos;s now reportsthat a ship of this name arrived at Leningrad on the 30th July. It has beenreported from Dairen that a Japanese Master and crew arrived on the 30th july to take over the Fulda (7,744 tons). It has previously been reported that thisship had been sold to Japanese buyers. The Ermland (6,258 tons) is reported tohave arrived at Kobe froni Takao, Formosa. There is an unconfirmed reportfrom Rio de Janeiro that the Konigsberg (6,466 tons) which left Para, Brazil onthe 28th May has arrived safely in a German port.Italy.11. Up to date 11 Italian merchant ships, totalling 68,641 tons, have been sunk or scuttled; 29, totalling 150,589 tons, have been captured, and 7 unidentifiedships, of 35,000 tons, have been reported sunk by submarines and aircraft.The total number of merchant ships lost to Italy is therefore 47 ships of254,230 tons.The Libano (1,592 tons), which was seized at Gibraltar, is on her way toEngland. The tanker Franco Martelli (10,535 tons), at Pernambuco, has a cargo of 10,000 tons of fuel oil and is capable of sailing at short notice. The Monfiore(5,498 tons), at New Orleans, is transhipping her cargo of scrap iron into aGreek ship which is bound for a Japanese port. The Furiere Consolini(1,922 tons) and the Granatiere Padula (3,904 tons), which had previously beenreported to have been chartered by a Japanese firm, left Shanghai on the5th August in company with a Japanese coast defence vessel.British Minelaying.12. H.M. Submarine Porpoise laid 50 mines in the Heligoland Bight onthe 29th July. On the 2nd August 300 mines were added to the East coast barrier, and on the 6th 130 mines were laid off the mouth of the Scheldt. Onthe 5th August 1,680 mines were laid to the south of St. George&apos;s Channel.During the week mines were laid by aircraft at Kiel, in the Fehmarn channel and at Travemunde in the Baltic, in the north entrance to the Kattegat, off theTexel, Ymuiden and Bergen-op-Zoom on the Dutch coast, and in the Elbe River.The total number of mines laid by aircraft up to date is approximately 772,but this figure includes mines lost or jettisoned.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.13. Enemy aircraft have continued to mine our ports and channels by night,and on the 8th August the following were closed to shipping : Invergordon,Inverness, Rosyth, Hartlepool, Tees on the East Coast, and all Bristol channel ports except Swansea (open to degaussed ships only); Milford Haven. Fishguard(at night) and the Kyles of Bute on the West Coast. South Coast ports haverarely been visited this week.A further 20 mines have been swept in the enemy contact minefield east ofHarwich, one of which has been recovered complete, the first to be brought induring the war.
On the 5th August a new channel was established between Barrow Deep andAldeburgh, and convoys were swept through on one day. Fifty-three magnetic mines have been accounted for during the week, making a total of 565 and contactmines 467.H.M.S. Peony, the first LL fitted Minesweeping Corvette, passed into service on the 6th August.Economic Warfare.British Contraband Control.14. During the period the 16th July-31st July the Contraband Committeedealt with the cases of 60 ships. Eleven of these were decisions on cases whichhad been shown in a previous return. Twelve ships, including 5 Greek, weredetained and the cargo of 9 ships were seized in prize. Fourteen ships were released with their cargoes.During the two weeks 24,541 tons of cargo destined for enemy countries wereseized, Greek ships having contributed nearly 20,000 tons. The main items were9,559 tons of food products, 6,865 tons of base metals, 5,932 tons of animal and vegetable fats and oilseeds and 1,636 tons of non-metallic minerals.German Contraband Control.15. The Finnish Pandia (2,368 tons) is reported to have been captured and taken into Tromso. It is reported from Stockholm that another Finnish ship,the Emily (1,565 tons), which had been captured at Bergen, has been released.Information has been received from the owners of the Finnish Lahti (616 tons)stating that the ship was captured by the Germans in the North Sea. Shesucceeded in escaping, but was recaptured and the master and crew forced toleave the ship.   The Lahti was bound for Hull from Gothenburg.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.16. Distribution of German Divisions. Since the 27th July the chiefchanges appear to be as follows : The equivalent of two divisions are now believed to be in Jutland, in additionto one in Copenhagen. While there is no change in the number of divisions on the Baltic Coast, at least three are believed to be concentrated in the Stettin area.It is estimated that there are now ten divisions in East Prussia, as against fivepreviously. Troops continue to be withdrawn to Germany from France, where itis calculated there are now not more than 60 divisions, a reduction of five.The present distribution of German divisions is believed to be as follows : Area.NorwayDenmarkGermany, excluding Baltic coast and East PrussiaBaltic CoastEast Prussia and CorridorPoland, excluding CorridorBohemia-Moravia ...AustriaSlovakiaFrance       .......Holland and BelgiumTotals    ...Armoured MotorizedDivisions.

The Police Divisionis not motorized.[21621] B 2
Middle East.East A frica.17. On the 3rd August the Italian post at Todenyang at the Northern endof Lake Rudolph was captured by our East African forces and a subsequentcounter-attack repulsed. The enemy lost at least 37 killed and a unknownnumber of wounded in this engagement.British Somaliland.18. The Italian invasion of British Somaliland began on the 4th August.The following day a strong Italian attack developed from the East and South-East. In the face of vastly superior numbers our garrisons at Hargeisa (one company N. Rhodesia Regiment and one company Somaliland Camel Corps) andOadweina (two troops Somaliland Camel Corps) carried out a withdrawal. TheItalians have also occupied Zeilah.The enemy will probably endeavour to obtain a series of rapid successesbefore the cessation of the rains. On the other land frontiers of Italian EastAfrica military activity has been confined to reconnaissance.Libya.19. The concentration of Italian troops, vehicles and war material on theEgypt-Libya frontier has been methodically increased, and it seems probable thatthe enemy now have sufficient strength to begin an offensive at any time.Turkey.20. Owing to the secrecy maintained by the Turkish General Staff it isdifficult to obtain any information about the present strength and distributionof the army. At the beginning of July it was reported that the army would bemobilized and concentrated by the 10th July. From the information subsequentlyreceived it appears that the concentration has not yet been completed. There is,however, no reason to doubt that the army is fully mobilised up to a strength of40 infantry divisions, 3 cavalry divisions and 1 armoured brigade. At present there are only 14 infantry divisions, 1 cavalry division and an armoured brigadein Thrace, which is 5 to 7 infantry divisions less than was anticipated.Far East.21. There are definite indications that the Japanese Army authorities inSouth China are pressing their demands for the passage of troops through Indo-China and for the use of the French railway to Yunnan.Iceland.22. The 6-inch CD. battery at Reykjavik, and the 4-7-inch battery atHafnarf jord are now ready for action.AIR SITUATION.General Review.23. The primary targets for our bombers were again airframe factories and oil refineries and plants, although attacks were also made on warships lyingin dock. Aerodromes continue to be the principal alternative targets. Bomberoperations were maintained on a moderate scale, but were in some cases particu-larly successful. The high-light of an otherwise uneventful week was the airbattle on the 8th August off the South Coast, in which, as described below, our fighters met with considerable success.24. The intensity of German bomber operations against this country was again much reduced apart from the heavy attacks on the convoy on the 8th August.German bomber-reconnaissance units were very active.   Night patrols of heavy
fighters over Holland and North-West Germany were maintained. The move-ment of transport aircraft is still extensive, and for the first part of the week the traffic was fairly equally divided between the West and Norway; in the latter part of the week there was an increase in traffic to Norway.25. In the Middle East our fighters have had considerable success againstsuperior numbers of the enemy. As already reported, Italian aircraft attackedour warships in the Western Mediterranean without success.26. Statistics of our own and enemy losses for the week ending 0600 on the8th August are given in Appendix V. This will be a weekly feature. extracts from Raid-Assessment Reports are given in Appendix VI and will also beincluded weekly.Great Britain.27. German bomber operations during the week were almost exclusivelyconcentrated by day against seaborne targets, and, apart from the 8th August,attacks were comparatively few and mostly unsuccessful. On the 8th Augustthree separate attacks, each of about 100 enemy aircraft, were directed against a convoy off the Isle of Wight, and several ships were sunk or damaged. All theseraids were engaged by fighters, and fifty-two enemy aircraft (seventeen Junkers 87and the remainder fighters) were definitely shot down, with a further fourteenunconfirmed. Our casualties amounted to seventeen fighters and a Blenheimengaged on a training flight.   Several of our pilots have been rescued.28. On numerous other occasions formations of aircraft approached ourcoast but turned back on sighting British fighters. On the 5th August athreatened attack in the Dover area was driven off before it could develop, andthree of the escorting fighters were shot down by Spitfires, a further four probablybeing destroyed. Except on two occasions land objectives were attacked at night,but these raids were sporadic and caused little damage.29. Minelaying aircraft were active each night and, although the areas are difficult to determine, it is probable that most of the East and West Coasts were affected, especially the Firth of Forth, Thames Estuary, Humber, Liverpool bay and Bristol Channel. It is possible that some of the enemy aircraft plotted offthe East Coast were fighters attempting to intercept our night bombers.30. Fighter Command flew 962 patrols, involving 3,173 sorties. cloud and haze made interception difficult during most of the week.Germany and German-Occupied Territory.31. Bomber Command flew 159 day and 352 night sorties during the week.Weather was again not good for daylight operations, except on the 2nd August,when twenty-five aircraft out of thirty-six despatched were able to carry out their task and successfully attacked several aerodromes in Holland and Belgium.Some of the aircraft encountered fighter opposition but were generally able to evade attack by flying into cloud, and only one of our aircraft failed to return.Aircraft despatched on other days were for the most part unable to complete their task owing to weather conditions and two attempts on the 6th August, toattack Aalborg, had to be abandoned. Attacks were, however, made on aerodromes in France and Holland, on an anti-aircraft ship off Den Helder, and troop con-concentrations near Abbeville. On the 1st August, as the result of a reconnaissancereport that thirty enemy aircraft were located on an aerodrome at Cherbourg,thirteen Blenheims from Coastal Command, escorted by ten Blenheim fighters,made an attack with considerable success. Hits were obtained on hangars and aircraft and fires started.32. Night operations were again somewhat restricted by weather duringthe week. Attacks were made on aircraft factories, on oil targets, railways and aerodromes. Attempts were also made to attack warships at Kiel, Hamburg andWilhelmshaven, but, although bombs were dropped in the target areas, no results could&apos;be observed.
33. The most successful attack during the week was carried out on theMonopol mine at Kamen, where fires were seen to envelope the target which appeared to be completely destroyed. Successful attacks were also made on oil plants at Gelsenkirchen, Homburg, Hamburg, Salzbergen, Monheim andSterkrade Holten, and on other similar targets. Bombs were dropped on severalnights on the marshalling yard at Hamm, and hits were also seen on the Domieraircraft factory at Wismar and the Krupp works at Essen. Leaflets were on one occasion dropped on North-West Germany.34. A new method of interception wras attempted by forming a circle ofsearchlights around the British aircraft and patrolling the area with fightersequipped with nose lights. This has so far been ineffective and one of the fighterswas destroyed by a Wellington near the Hague, while others passed close to our bombers without seeing them. An unidentified aircraft was shot down off&apos; Norderney by a Hampden engaged in minelaying.35. On the night of the 3rd-4th August an Albacore of the coastal command successfully attacked oil tanks at Rotterdam and Swordfish, detailed toa similar target at Vlardingen. bombed searchlights at the Hook and the docks at Dordrecht. Two Blenheims also attacked Emden without visible result. Onthe 7th nine Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm attacked petrol installations at Dolvik,near Bergen, and a pumping station or refinery was hit.North Sea and Coastal.36. During the week Coastal Command supplied escorts to 142 convoys and flew 490 other sorties, covering the usual reconnaissances, and patrols inwhich, during the last few days, Bomber Command aircraft have participated.Extensive photographic reconnaissances from Norway to the West Coast of Francehave given important information as to the movements of shipping and aircraft.Photographs taken on the 5th August showed the Schellingwoude seaplane base at Amsterdam to be occupied for the first time by enemy seaplanes, which includedseventeen Junkers 52 transport aircraft on floats and fifteen Heinkel 115. Inaddition to action against merchant shipping and E-boats, aircraft on patrolhave reported ten attacks on U-boats, of which three were promising. Minelayingwas carried out on several nights in the Baltic and off the German and Dutchcoasts.Middle East and Mediterranean.Malta.37. Twelve Hurricanes were flown off H.M.S. Argus when 300 to 400 milesfrom Malta; of these, eleven landed safely on the Island and one crashed onlanding. There have been no bombing attacks during the week, but on several days formations of Italian fighters and bombers flew over the Island. On one occasion a OR. 42 fighter was shot down by Gladiators, and on another aHurricane was attacked by eight fighters without result. Reconnaissances were flown over, the harbour at Cagliari, and attacks were made by aircraft of the fleet air Arm, as already described.Egypt.38. On the 1st and 3rd August Blenheims, escorted by Gladiators, attacked the ammunition dump at Bardia, and shipping and the aerodrome at Derna,photographic reconnaissances later confirming the success of these operations.On the 4th August a Lysander accompanied by four Gladiators- reported aconsiderable number of enemy transport at Bir El Gobi, and this was attackedlater on the same day by nine Blenheims. Both formations were attacked byabout fifty Italian fighters, with the result that six enemy aircraft were shot down,three by Gladiators, two by Blenheims and one by their own A.A. fire, our lossesbeing confined to one Gladiator.39. Enemy aircraft attacked Mersa Matruh on the 4th August without result, but did some damage to the aerodrome at Sidi Barrani. A further raid was intercepted by Gladiators and forced to jettison bombs; two enemy aircraft are
believed to have been badly damaged. On the 6th August a Sunderland shadowingenemy ships was forced down off Tobruk, one of the crew being killed and fourwounded, and was later seen being towed into Tobruk harbour.Sudan.40. Several bombing attacks have been carried out on targets in Eritrea.At Massawa an ammunition dump was attacked without result on the 29th July,and direct hits were observed on fuel stores. Three submarines were successfullybombed, as already described. Successful attacks were also carried out on the oil depots at Acicio and Sheikh Said Island, near Massawa, and on troop concentrations and buildings at Kassala, the aerodrome at Asmara, a camp atGura and oil stores at Zula.Enemy aircraft attacked Summit and Port Sudan, causing slight damage tothe railway; two bombers were brought down.Aden.41. On the 31st July, Blenheims, escorted by fighters, attacked the aerodrome at Chinele, near Diredawa. On their return flight they encountered enemy aircraft attempting to bomb Zeilah, and Gladiators shot&quot; down one S. 81 and damaged another. On a later occasion another formation of Blenheims, detailedto the same target, were attacked by three C.R. 42 fighters without result. On the1st August the naval barracks at Assab were successfully bombed, and -on the3rd August an attack was made on tanks and guns advancing on Hargeisa. a french aircraft carried out a successful reconnaissance of Diredawa on the3rd August, in spite of fighter opposition. The enemy made two unsuccessfulattacks on Berber a.Kenya.42. Aircraft of the South African Air Force attacked troops near Moyale,and the aerodrome at Javello in South Abyssinia.Enemy aircraft made two attacks on Arbo, near Wajir, and during thesecond attack a CA. 133 was shot down by Furies. An attack on the 6th Auguston Wajir aerodrome badly damaged a Hartebeeste aircraft. The enemy were again intercepted by Furies but without success.Italian Air Intelligence.43. The effect of Royal Air Force attacks on the Massawa area is indicated by reports that Otumlo aerodrome has been evacuated, and that the fuel tanks atAcicio, the oil port, have been emptied. Aircraft from Otmulo are now statedto be dispersed under tarpaulins in a closed area some two miles to the north ofMassawa. Large quantities of oil are reported to have been conveyed in barrelsfrom Acicio to Nokhra Island, about thirty miles east of Massawa, where twelveunderground tanks are apparently being prepared.44. Further news of the naval action on the 9th July off Cape Spartivento(South DaTdiuii), confirms the report that the battleship Cesare was actuallymistaken for FLM.S. Hood by Italian aircraft, and was so heavily bombed bythem that she only reached Genoa with difficulty and is likely to be out of action for at least six months. This has apparently caused some friction between Navaland Air Force personnel.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General Review.45. During daylight enemy air activity overland has been very small and attacks have been concentrated on our convoys off the East and South Coasts.During darkness enemy aircraft have flown over the whole of England, most of wales and the whole of Scotland except for the West Coast. The flights havemvariably been made by single aircraft which have consistently used the sameroutes. For the first time there has been a marked tendency to fly over theMidland Industrial Area.
46. Bombing has been on a very small scale and nearly ten per cent, of thehigh-explosive bombs did not explode and a number of incendiary bombs alsofailed. Leaflets consisting of extracts from Hitler&apos;s recent speech, headed &quot;AnAppeal to Reason,&quot; have been dropped over various parts of England.Casualties and Damage.47. Eight people killed and eighty-four injured during the week, but no appreciable damage has been reported.Civil Defence Services.48. These have worked satisfactorily on the few occasions on which theywere in action. Among cases of interest was one in which the A.F.S. extinguishedthe burning oil from a ship which had been bombed in harbour and so savedanother ship. While carrying out this work the personnel had to shelter duringanother raid, but returned to their work with determination and efficiency. on other occasions quick decisions and initiative have saved fires from incendiary bombs.Warnings.49. During the week there have been 24 Red Warnings by day and 135 Redand 583 Purple Warnings by night. As yet there is not sufficient data to show the effect on production, but most of the Purple Warnings were caused by single aircraft and are on the scale of ten Warnings per casualty incurred.
