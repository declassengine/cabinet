and should he kept under lock and key.SECRET,W.P.  (40)  288July 27th, 1940.WAR CABINET.RELATIONS WITH FRANCE.Memorandum Toy the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The unofficial representative of the French Government inLondon left a communication on the 25th July stating that theFrench Government would not receive a British Agent in Franceuntil two incidents had been settled;     the dropping of leafletsin French Morocco and the retention in England of certain members of the French Missions in London.      The text of this communication is attached (Annex l).In considering the reply to be returned to the FrenchGovernment the question arises of the price we are preparedto pay to maintain relations with them.      7/e are at presentseriously handicapped by a complete lack of information as towhat is happening in France and ignorance of the real aims and volicy of the present French Government.      Some contact is highly desirable if only on that ground alone.On the other hand it is doubtful whether even unofficialrelations with France will stand the strain of the action weare taking in the matter of French ships,  in the french colonies,  in encouraging the resistance of free Frenchmen,in conducting propaganda, in blockading and bombarding France.Fresh problems will constantly crop up and it may in the endprove impracticable to maintain an Agent at Vichy even if one is received there, and it might be worse to have to withdraw an agent than not to send one at all.      The difficulties would be greater if the French Government moved to Paris.       But the two points which the French Government have raised in connexionwith the appointment of an Agent are of minor importancecompared to the other problems outstanding between the twocountries,  and they are not essential either to the prosecution of the war or even to our propaganda among Frenchmen.      I am therefore disposed to think that a reply should be given inconciliatory terms which gives some satisfaction to the FrenchGovernment and keeps the door open for them to agree to receiveSir Nevile Bland.A draft answer is attached (Annex 2)    If this is approvedit would involve the cessation for the time being of the dropping of leaflets in French Morocco.H.FOREIGN OFFICE.July 27th,  1940This Document is the property of His Majesty&apos;s Government

ANNEX I.Communication from the French Representative. (Translation).As a result of the breaking-off of diplomatic relationsbetween France and Great Britain, it had been agreed thatM. Paul Morand should remain in London,  and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should send an official agent to France.Since then, His Majesty&apos;s Government has detained aboutfifty officers attached to the Missions, and British aircraft have dropped leaflets in Morocco which are injurious to thePetain Government.Under these circumstances the French Government cannotauthorise Sir Nevile Bland to go to France before thesetwo incidents have been settled.The French Ambassador at Madrid has been asked to bring this decision to the notice of the British Ambassador if sir nevile Bland should have arrived in Spain on his way to France25th July,  1940.

Annex ii draft reply to the French Representative.His Majesty&apos;s Government have leer-rjed with regret that the French Government are unwilling to receive Sir No Bland in France until two matters have been settled.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment attach much importance to themaintenance of contact with the French Governmentin the manner which had been agreed, and it wasprecisely for the discussion of such matters that have now been raised that the presence.of ani-igent would be particularly useful.2.     As regards the French Missions in London,every effort was made to reduce the number ofpersons who were asi-ced to defer their departureto the minimum consistent with security.      Ofthe officers whose departure was deferred, somewhose work had been of a particularly confidentialnature were xvept bacii at the request of the trench-Embassy, others are engaged in the liquidation ofthe work of their Missions, while others again havehad access to secret information owing to the closeterms of friendship and collaboration on whichthey had been working with their British colleagues.It is much regretted that steps to retain for thetime being these officers in tais&apos; country havebeen necessary, more particularly in the case ofthe Air Missions, but the measures taken cast noreflections on the members of the Missionsthemselves and the e will be free to return toFrance as soon as the information to which theyhave had access has become out of date.     Themembers of the Air Missions for example will be free to leave in two months time.     further concessions in the case of particular   ndividualswill be made wherever possible.3.     As regards the leaflets dropped in MoroccoHis majesty&apos;s Government were obliged to maras   an effort to correct certain statements injurious to themselves which had been issued as regards some oftheir actions.    Particular attention is drawn toa statement issued on July 15th by the trenchLegation in Dublin.     While therefore His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must always reserve the right to masethe tfue facts of a given situation known in anyway that may be open to them;  they have no wish to drop leaflets in Morocco which are injurious tothe Government of Marshal Petain. &apos;4.     In the light of the foregoing explanationsHis Majesty&apos;s Government trust that the trenchGovernment will agree to adhere to theunderstanding reached in regard to the exchangeof Agents, ana will receive Sir N.. Bland at theearliest possible date.      Sir F. Bland willremain in the United kingdom until the FrenchGovernment&apos;s reply is received.
