We attach, great importance to improving Anglo-Soviet relations as faras we can, and wish to give you fullest support possible in this difficult task. Weare anxious to take any chance there may be to facilitate favourable developmentof Soviet policy, although it is no doubt probable that the latter must, in any case,be expected to move on lines of extreme caution vis-a-vis of Germany, at least solong as the Soviet Government is in doubt of our ability to maintain and improve our position at home and in the Mediterranean.2. As regards recognition, I have given full weight to considerations youadvance, but I see great difficulty in granting de jure recognition. Apart fromthe reasons given in my previous telegrams, it is important that we should notbe driven into a position where we shall find it difficult to refuse recognition ofevery fait accompli achieved by countries like Russia and Japan, who are taking advantage of the war situation, and that we should not provide precedents forthe recognition of German faits accomplis by other countries (Sweden, forexample, which is being tempted to recognise a German-controlled regime in norway). In these circumstances only safe course is to adhere to logically defen-sihle j^rinciple that political changes produced during this war ought not to berecognised de jure pending a general peace settlement.3. In deference to your views, however, I am causing Baltic Ministers to beinformed orally and privately that no, official answer will be returned, to theirnotes (though their names will remain on the diplomatic list). I have also agreed with the Ministry of Shipping that they will not proceed, at any rate for the11130   [21591]secret.P. (40) 312.August 12, 1940.
present, to requisitioning of Baltic shipping which is being detained in british ports and being brought into them from the high seas, although Cabinet authority has been given for this.4. Moreover, I am quite prepared to let you inform the Soviet Government,if it will help you in your relations with them, that His Majesty&apos;s government recognise that they are de facto in administrative control of the Baltic Statesand are prepared to deal with them on that basis in matters affecting thoseStates. But it must be understood that the Soviet Government, while refusing to pay compensation for British property in Baltic States, must not use such astatement as the basis of a legal claim in the English Courts to Baltic assets inthis country; and if they wish for a formal declaration of such de facto recog-nition, either it must be so worded that it cannot be used in this way, or it mustbe part of the arrangement that no such claim shall be made except as the resultcf an agreement on&apos; the matters at issue arising out of the absorption of the baltic states.5. As regards the retention of Baltic gold and ships, we are bound to do our best to ensure compensation for the loss of British property in the baltic states, and, indeed, we detained the gold and ships for this purpose. On theother hand, I appreciate what you say about the Soviet being unwilling to admitprinciple of compensation, and I therefore leave it to your discretion to playthe hand as best you can, on the understanding that our retention of the Balticgold and ships will enable us to give compensation to owners for the seizure ofBritish property. You will best be able to judge whether or not as a tacticalmove you ought to put in an immediate claim for compensation for this property in general terms. Incidentally, our case will be still further strengthened ifit can be shown that in dealing with foreign property in the Baltic States theSoviet Government are discriminating in favour of German interests (see Kovnotelegram No. 235 and Tallinn telegram No. 122).6. For the rest, it occurs to me that, if faced with a refusal by the SovietGovernment to pay compensation direct, it might be possible for you to get roundthis difficulty by dealing with the matter in two stages. We might agree torecognise the Soviet Governments claim for the return of the gold and the ships(thus incidentally according de facto recognition), while by means of a separate and maybe unofficial understanding the Soviet Government would acquiesce inour recouping ourselves for the loss of British property in the Baltic States by using the gold and the ships for this purpose. The Soviet Government would thusaccept the balance of anything left over as a full settlement of their claim.7. Since drafting the above I have seen your telegrams Nos. 591 and 592.I agree that we must watch carefully for an eventual change in Soviet policy;but you yourself acknowledge that this is not likely to precede clarification ofwar situation.8. I doubt whether mere possibility of preparing the ground for an eventualimprovement in Anglo-Soviet relations is in itself a sufficient reason for makinga major concession at this stage. On the contrary, your estimate of the situationfortifies my belief that for the time being we should make no comprehensivegestures, either of concession or of defiance, but should attempt to negotiate asettlement of outstanding questions in the Baltic as elsewhere. soviet ambassador has let us know that his Government will be influenced in theirattitude towards this country by the method and spirit by which outstandingproblems are settled. I have no doubt that your Excellency will so handle these negotiations as to create that psychological improvement in atmosphere sovaluable for the future. Moreover, if in the course of these interchanges HisMajesty&apos;s Government give proof of determination to defend their interests, itmay be as valuable for future relations as a gesture of unilateral generosity,and it should also, in my opinion, tend to ease rather than embarrass the task of British policy in other spheres -a. consideration to which you draw attention in the second paragraph of your telegram No. 592. n9. I take it that until the question of the gold and ships has been got outof the way you would not propose to speak to M. Molotov on the lines of proposals B, C and D in your telegram No. 592. In any case, before you do soI should be glad to have a further opportunity of considering these interestingproposals. In particular I notice in proposal C that you contemplate only asking for a barter agreement instead of a war trade agreement, as was our original intention.
