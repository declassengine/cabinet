(40) 272.July 20, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I CIRCULATE herewith at the Prime Ministers request telegrams whichhave passed between the Prime Minister and the Governor-General on the subjectof the proposed declaration of Indian policy, together with my minute of the19th July to the Prime Minister and the personal telegrams between theGovernor-General and myself referred to in his telegram to the Prime Minister.L. S. A.India Office, July 20, 1940.(1)Telegram from Prime Minister to the Viceroy of India, dated July 16, 1940.5-U.FOLLOWING for Viceroy from Prime Minister: &quot; The Cabinet last week was entirely favourable to your two proposals.First, the expansion of your Council by the inclusion of representativeIndians, not, however, including a representative of the Indian Princes;secondly, the setting up of a War Advisory Committee of leading Indians,including three representatives of the Princes, to give Indians an opportunityfor full co-operation in India&apos;s war effort.&quot; Paragraph 6 of your telegram of the 1st July (No. 1187-S) was readby some as suggesting that you thought that, in order to make these twomeasures effective, they should be accompanied by some new declaration on the Constitutional issue.&quot; During the lifetime of the late Government I understood (see yourtelegram of the 6th April, 1940 (517-S)) that you had reached the position that, in view of the attitude of Congress and the widening rift betweenthe Moslem League and Congress, the right course was to lie back and make no further gesture or pronouncement, relying on the declarations already made to give effect to the Cabinet decision of the 14th October, 193ft/f as,for example, the statement which you made on the 17th Octoberryour OrientClub speech delivered on the 10th January, 1940fand the various statements made here in Parliament.&quot; I should he glad to know from you before the matter is againconsidered1 by the Cabinet (1) whether you consider that a further declara-tion is necessary to procure the acceptance of the two practical steps on[21548] bif (OM (it) 47* C*uJvtl*^, MiuJfr* U
which we are all agreed, (2) if so what are the new circumstances in thecondition of India which have led you to this view, and (3) the actual form which you think the declaration should take. I should add that I see great difficulties in our agreeing upon a new Constitutional declaration at thepresent time when invasion appears imminent, when the life of the Mother-country is obviously at stake, and when in consequence the thrashing out inParliament of the issues involved in such a far-reaching departure isimpossible. If, however, you know exactly what you want to say and feelthat it is vital to the success of your new proposal or still more to the internalpeace and orderly government of India, it would obviously be our duty to give it immediate consideration.&quot;(2)Teleoram from Viceroy, dated Jidy 18, 1940.1430-S.FOLLOWING for Prime Minister from Viceroy. Begins: Your telegramof the 16th instant. I am very grateful to Cabinet for accepting expansion ofmy Council and establishment of War Advisory Council..2. As regards declaration, you have asked me three questions inparagraph No. 4.3. Answer to No. 1 is that I favour a further declaration (I should prefer to call it a &quot;statement &quot;) for reasons given in the next paragraph. I cannotguarantee (and I have previously made this quite clear to the Secretary of State)that even if as extensive as Secretary of State&apos;s draft it would secure acceptance by two major political parties. I suspect that Congress will stand out for their full demand of a declaration of independence, and there might well be difficulties with Muslim League over exact terms of their co-operation.4. Your second question. You are quite right in thinking that I have beenaverse throughout the spring, and up till very recently indeed, from any furtherdeclaration or any move. I have been greatly concerned that we should not makeany premature move, and made that clear to the Secretary of State. I am satisfied that it is wise (as Cabinet now agree) that at this stage, given ourintensification of the war effort and change in the international situation, whichhas put the whole burden of the war upon His Majesty&apos;s Government, we shouldtake immediate steps without waiting longer for general agreement here to expand my Council and to associate Indian non-official opinion with the conductof the war through a War Advisory Council. I do not think that we can wiselytake or announce those steps without accompanying them by some reference toI general constitutional position. Scale of any such reference is discussed in thefollowing paragraphs.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; But announcement of expansion, &amp;c. (which may fallrather flat, in any case, if major political parties will not co-operate)&apos; will certainly fall much flatter if there is no accompanying statement such as publicopinion here tends, however unreasonably, to expect on these occasions. Again,j absence of any reaffirmation of our intention would, I am certain, be misunder-I stood, and possibly construed as a change of policy: Again, apart from factthat I had sketched out (though in terms on my own authority) outline of apossible declaration with Gandhi, I have inevitably had to take soundings ofJinnah, the leader of the Mahasabha, and the Chancellor of the Chamber of princes, and to consult Governors, and discuss in general terms in my ownCouncil. Detailed terms of any statement have not been indicated to any of these,but possibility of one is very definitely in the air. This has been reinforced bythe various press messages from home indicating that something of this naturemay be expected from His Majesty&apos;s Government. Apart from that, general sense of Governors is, as you are aware, in favour of some further clarification of ourJ intentions, and so is that of my Council. Irrespective of atmosphere and with! this background, my considered advice is that there should be some form of state-ment or declaration to accompany announcement of expansion.5. Your third question is as to contents of any such declaration. I should explain, in first place, that I have asked the Secretary of State to show youcertain correspondence which passed between him and me during June. Thatcorrespondence I read (and I think I was fully entitled to read) as meaning that
general feeling of (? His Majesty&apos;s Government), and present Cabinet would bein favour of a further extensive and early, if not immediate, declaration of their intentions towards India, which would go a good deal beyond anything that had so far been said; and it was in the light of that correspondence that I had my discussions with Gandhi, Jinnah, &amp;c. I now find that my assumption isill-founded, and that, in fact, references in question were exploratory and werenot intended in any way to reflect the view of Cabinet. I regret that there shouldhave been any misunderstanding as to that, but, now that I know that that is thecase, and that I am seized with views of Cabinet as stated in last paragraph ofyour telegram, statement I would favour would be different in character from thatwhich has previously been under discussion.6. In paragraph 6 of my telegram 1187-S, dated the 1st July, which hasbeen circulated to the Cabinet, I said that I would favour a declaration or state-ment going as far as I had tentatively gone in sounding Gandhi, or somethingshort of that, if the Cabinet were prepared to go so far; and I made it clearearlier in that telegram that, in going as far as I had with Gandhi, I wasconscious that I might have gone further than the Cabinet might have wished.To Gandhi I said that the sort of clarification of His MajestyV governments intentions I had in mind might be: (a) Status. Status of other self-governing Dominions, i.e., reaffirmation ofour pledge that Dominion Status Status of other self-governingDominions remained our objective.(b) Reminder that His Majesty&apos;s Government had already pledged them-selves that the whole scheme and policy of the Act of 1935 should beopen to discussion at the end of the war.(c) That fullest consideration he given to the views of all interests.(d) That there were certain matters which must be the particular interestof His Majesty&apos;s Government at this stage, such as defence, external affairs, debt, perhaps matters touching on the Services, the positionof the Indian States, commercial discrimination : but that there seemed a wide measure of agreement that these were matters that could be dealt with separately and apart from the main constitutionalscheme.(e) That as regards the main constitutional scheme and framing of future constitution on assumption that matters just mentioned wereprotected in some suitable manner, His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe perfectly content to abide by conclusions of any representative bodyof Indians on which various political parties could agree, and that(unless there was some quite obvious flaw) it might be assumed that parliament would implement the recommendations of such a body&apos;solong as they were based on agreement.(/) That I thought it not impossible that His Majesty&apos;s Government, whohad refrained hitherto from committing themselves because ofimpossibility of giving any really reliable firm date, might be foundready to take a chance, and say that, so far as they were concerned,they would spare no effort to bring about Dominion Status within ayear after the conclusion of the war, and to set up whatever machinerythose concerned agreed as appropriate to work out the newconstitution immediately on conclusion of war, accepting, inconnection with new status of India, and subject to reservationsmentioned above, whatever conclusions might emerge in agreementfrom that body.7. I would repeat that I not only informed Gandhi orally that any suchtentative scheme was entirely on my own and without any authority of any sortfrom His Majesty&apos;s Government, but that I confirmed that in writing to himtwo days later.7. * [Sic] As paragraph No. 6 of my telegram of the 1st July made clear,I should be prepared.to make either that declaration, or a declaration fallingshort of it, in any particular respect which may be indicated if Cabinet so desired.I cannot guarantee, as I have made clear, that it would secure our objective : butfor all that, and for reasons I have already given. I favour some statement.-I thtnk-it-is probably important, and I do not think much risk is involved, that[21548] b 2
we should go as far as accepting that Indians themselves should be left to frameproposals for parts of new Constitution other than those mentioned in (d) above.I think, top, that some indication of readiness, so far as we are concerned, tosee the Dominion status point reached, if that could be attained consequent onagreement between Indians, by a particular date would have a considerable effect.As regards (c) above, I would favour strengthening it by a specific addition, asin Secretary of State&apos;s draft, to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot contemplate the transfer of their present responsibility for peace and welfare of India to any system of government whose authority was directly denied by large and powerful element in India&apos;s national life; nor could they be partiesto the coercion of such an element into submission to such a government. Sucha statement should also, as in Secretary of State&apos;s draft, bring out that we couldnot go into these matters in war time. Statement on lines in question (draft ofwhich I would, of course, submit if Cabinet so desire) differs from draft which theCabinet have already under consideration : (a) for very definite change of emphasis and approach;(b) in the omission of any reference to the instrument of agreement or themethod for implementing or renewing any arrangements made inrespect of these subjects ((d) in paragraph 6 above) to be settledoutside the body of representative Indians (paragraph 6 of Secretaryof State&apos;s draft of a statement);(c) further emphasising obligations;(d) leaving our hands, as I see it, free in the future.I feel little doubt that if the Cabinet were prepared to authorise me to go sofar, effect here on moderate opinion would be good (though I do not exaggeratethe importance of moderate opinion in India); and I should have thought thatit would have a definite propaganda value outside. It is conceivable (though i cannot assess this with any preciseness) that it might encourage fissiparoustendencies outside Congress : I do not doubt that it would improve prospect ofMahasabha (? entering an) expanded Council and of Liberal support; and itwould I think strengthen the hands of well-meaning individuals or elementswho might welcome an excuse for lending greater support than at present toan expanded Council and to my War Advisory Council.8. These are, however, matters of high policy and cannot be settled purelyon consideration of Indian situation, important as that must be. If therefore the Cabinet, after considering my present representations (and I am grateful to them for giving me an opportunity of commenting), feel that in the circum-stances referred to in the last paragraph of your telegram it would be impossiblefor His Majesty&apos;s Government to go so far. I see no alternative (still favouringa statement of some sort, as I do) but to make one on the lines in the following paragraph.9. Statement in this event would be to the general effect that, as was commonknowledge, I had made a further effort to resolve the existing political deadlock,I had seen the political leaders and had discussed with the utmost franknessthe whole position and possible methods of dealing with it with a view to maintaining Indian unity and securing unified support for the conduct of thewar : that to my profound disappointment and that of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment these conversations had revealed that internal differences, which had hitherto stood in the way of any progress, were as deep and real as ever, andthat there was no hope of any common basis emerging; that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, deeply regretting as they did that that should be so, remainedanxious, and would continue to lend their own endeavours in every way theycould, to facilitate a settlement, but that at the point things had reached theycould no longer reconcile themselves to a situation in which, because of these differences, non-official opinion was not represented in the Central government at a time of critical important&apos;tance, and their anxiety to associate non-official opinionmore closely with the conduct of the war could not be met: that I had therefore been authorised to expand my Council, and to set up a War Advisory Council, &amp;c.,and appealed for the support of all men of goodwill and all elements of substance in the country to support me. Here again, if Cabinet decision should be infavour of this alternative (though I repeat that I trust they may be able to let me have required first alternative) I would submit a separate draft of what i propose to say.
I venture in conclusion only to say that it would be of much assistance tome if I could have an early decision. Congress Working Committee meei3 onthe 25th July. There would be some advantage if it were practicable to issuestatement by me before then, though that consideration is not, of course, decisive.But I do think some early indication of what we have in mind, whether it goesfar or not, is becoming of real importance.(3)Minute from the Secretary of State for India to Prime Minister, dated july 19. 1940.Prime Minister,yOU will see from the Viceroy&apos;s reply to your telegram that while it is stillhis &quot;considered advice &quot; that his invitations to the expanded Executive council should be accompanied by a declaration or statement, he now, in response to yourlead, outlines a somewhat different and in one major respect less far-reaching one.He would still declare that, subject to the necessary limitations on which there isno difference of opinion, we would allow Indians to determine their own Constitu-tion if they can come to agreement upon it. But he would omit the suggestion of embodying in the form of an agreement the limitations on which we must insist.So far as I can see his suggested alternative does not differ in substance from myrevised draft with paragraph 6 left out.There is, however, one part of his telegram, namely paragraph 5, which doescall for some comment on my part. He says in that paragraph that my earlierpersona] and exploratory correspondence with him entitled him to assume thatthe views I expressed were those of the Cabinet and contrasts them with the closing paragraph of your personal telegram which has now made him &quot; seizedwith the views of the Cabinet.&quot;It is, of course, only the normal and proper procedure on the part of theSecretary of State at this end to communicate his personal views to the viceroy and to try to come to a general agreement with him before approaching the Cabine&apos;on any subject on which the concurrence of both would be material to the Cabinet^decision, and it certainly never occurred to me that the Viceroy could look upon mypreliminary exchange of views with him in any other light. As you will see fromthe last paragraph of my first telegram to him (2701) I emphasised the tentativecharacter of my suggestions and the fact that any advice upon my recently agreedParliamentary answer would require Cabinet approval. Again in my later,telegram (754) in which I urged him to try and bring political leaders together(on the lines which the Cabinet has since approved) and suggested, in the eventof a demand for a declaration of policy, a certain general line, I added &quot; provided always that the Cabinet agree.&quot; In a supplementary telegram (753) I went further and asked him whether he would prefer an initiative from myself or the Cabinet.So I do not think there can really have been sufficient ground for a misunder-standing of which he gave no indication at the time.In any case, as he still felt doubtful as to my proposals, but did decide, onhis own, to summon Gandhi and Jinnah, I left the matter in my telegram No. 798of the 21st June to his own judgment, only asking him to leave the door open forthe future.I was, consequently, a little surprised, though undoubtedly pleased, when I received his telegram of the 1st July describing his interview with Gandhi andoutlining a declaration going as far in most respects and in one respect, as totime, even further than anything I had suggested. I concluded, not unnaturally, that the collapse of France had so altered the situation in the interval that the right moment, upon which he has always laid stress, had,, inhis opinion, arrived for making a more definite advance.I thereupon drafted a declaration, based mainly upon his outline to Gandhi(as, indeed, he suggested in his printed telegram No. 1187-S. of the same date),and submitted it for his comment. He replied on the 6th July briefly summarising the views of the Provincial Governors, whom he had meanwhile consulted, asbeing generally in favour both of expansion and of a declaration, adding that&quot;we are in agreement, subject to Cabinet approval, that there should be adeclaration,&quot; and promising to send his considered Amendments as soon as
possible. These were of a verbal character and were mostly embodied in the draftsubmitted to the Cabinet. None of them suggested that he was not in agreementwith the substance of the proposed declaration. On the 8th July he telegraphedagain to say that he had no supplementary suggestions to make, and was certainthat &quot;a declaration on the broad lines which I used with Gandhi, and whichare embodied in declaration now under consideration, should go some way tomake clear to the world our position and to rally moderate support.&quot;You will realise that I had every reason, when I submitted to the Cabinetthe draft declaration based upon his suggestions to Gandhi, to suppose that theViceroy and I were in full agreement. He is,, of course, entitled to modify his views in deference to the arguments put to him in your telegram, and I make no complaint of that.You will see that the Viceroy presses once again for an early decision.L. S. A.(4)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State for India, dated june 1, 1940.(IMMEDIATE.)859-S. My telegram 820-S, dated 28th May. I saw Sikendar on 30th May.He is of course most anxious to co-operate in every possible way, but sees littleimmediate signs of free and unconditional co-operation on the part of Congress.Jinnah looks as though he would, purely for tactical reasons, continue to press for some unequivocal guarantee from His Majesty&apos;s Government as long ascorresponding demand is advanced by Congress. Gandhi&apos;s letter leaves me withthe impression, however, that prospect of Congress definitely refraining fromembarrassing us in prosecution of the war is very much better than one mighthave thought earlier, and that, now that they are clearer than they may havebeen that we are not to be stampeded into further concessions, their line maybe to remain out of office (they can hardly hope to resume without an agreementwith Moslems, and chances of Jinnah offering acceptable conditions are small:while non-resumption of office can be pointed to as a continuing protest against our refusal to accept their full demand): continue to press their full claim onplatform, &amp;c.: but in practice refrain from interfering with our war effort.Equally. I would not anticipate trouble, at any rate in present circumstances,from Jinnah and his friends. In other words there is some possibility that wepiay be able to get on with the war on present basis subject to a certain amountof face-saving complaint from Congress that we are governing on an autocraticbasis, and from Moslems that we will not give them unqualified undertaking that any constitutional change will be subject to their approval. That mightsuit us quite well, though of course we cannot exclude possibility of breaches oflaw of a serious character by individual Congressmen, and the necessity for taking action against them might give rise to trouble.2. Since above was drafted, there has been very significant article by Gandhiin Harijan which appears to fit in well with what I have said in paragraph No. 1.I am repeating text of it to. you separately; but as you will see he says interms that &quot; if the British Government will not mo motu declare India as a free country having the right to determine her status and Constitution (corruptgroup) opinion we should wait till heat of the battle in the heart of the allied countries subsides and future is clearer than it is. We do not seek our indepen-dence out of Rritain&apos;s ruin. That is not the way of non-violence.&quot; It remains to.be seen of course what the effect of this declaration will he on his followers.But it is relative that the secret report I have just received on Nehru&apos;s activities in the Punjab Satyagraha training camp on the 24th-26th May suggests thathe made it clear that he did not want Germany to win the war, that it was hisstrong wish to see British Imperialism go down with Nazism; that the defeat of Britain would make him sorrow, and that he therefore urged nothing shouldbe done in India which would really irrmeril Great Britain. He is alleged to have declared if India acted in this way, her position would be raised in the eyes of the civilised world. On the other hand, if she tried to create difficulties, itwould merely be a sign of their own weakness and India would appear in the
eyes of the world as petty bargainers. He is stated to have declared further that if Britain lost the war, India would soon be in the throes of a civil war.He is himself debarred from discussing possible consequences of an invasion ofIndia, having proclaimed many times that the danger of a new conquest of thesub-continent is a bogey invented by the British to scare Indian Nationalists., (5)Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor-General, dated June 2, 1840.2701. Personal. Your telegram 1st June, 859-S. Your interesting analysis of situation as affected by events here makes me wonder whether things are notdeveloping to a point at which some initiative on your part might not, after all,become possible. Even if Italy comes in and war situation continues grave, the favourable mood may not last, and the next few weeks may possibly offer anopportunity which might not recur before another swing to left led to direct andirrevocable trouble which we should have to deal with on very different lines.The kind of thing that occurs to me is the possibility of inviting Party leaders,possibly with provincial Premiers and ex-Premiers and Princes&apos; representa-tives, to meet informally in order to discuss non-committally and withoutprejudice the best method of approach during the war to some agreement as tothe procedure to be adopted after the war in order to arrive at a constitutional settlement (a) as between Indians themselves, (b) as regards the fulfilment byHis Majesty&apos;s Government of our responsibilities in respect of defence, foreignpolicy, Princes, services, &amp;c.2. By method of approach I mean something like an agreement, followingup Gandhi&apos;s suggestion of conference of a few best men, English and Indian, tothe setting up without delay a small committee of study and recommendation to explore the whole constitutional problem, provincial and central, to set out thepros and cons of various alternative solutions and indicate their own solutions oralternative solutions both as to the constitution itself and as to the body whichshould after the war take their suggestions into definite consideration. i recognise that they might recommend a purely Indian body which would be free to frame general structure of Indian constitution. But the constitution pro-pounded would have to be subject to such additions, adjustments or modifications as would subsequently be agreed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in order to providefor fulfilment of its responsibilities, such agreement to be embodied in form of long-term treaty.    Constitution_as modified apd treaty to enter into effectconcurrently. Whether this Indian T5ody should be based on election as Congressdemand or on the existing elements in Federation, viz., Provinces and States,leaving decision as to method of choosing representatives to each unit, is just thekind of question the committee could discuss.3. The arguments for some such method of approach are firstly that insteadof long-range theoretical objections by parties the problem could be discussed in private and in a practical spirit without any party being committed to the resultof the discussions. Secondly practical investigation could begin at once and ifduring the course of it the situation so developed that an acceptable solution ofthe nature and process of the actual constituent or ratifying body emerged therewould be no obstacle to setting it up immediately after the war. We are alwaysbeing pressed for a date for inaugurating Dominion Status. In this way wecould turn tables on our critics and say that we are ready to set up the constituentbodj^jmrnediately after the war if only Indians will first agree what it is to be,and equally ready to discuss its conclusions as soon as we know what those con-elusions are, with a view to agreement on the final adjusted constitution so thatit may then be put into effect as soon as possible. Thirdly such a procedure would meet the Indian demand for a constitution framed by Indians alone and onlymodified for a period to be agreed upon by an agreement preserving at any ratethe form of a treaty between partners of equal status. Fourthly while theCommittee was prosecuting its useful studies India could get on with the war.4. Whether, if &quot;such informal conference as I have suggested could cometogether, it might also discuss, in addition to the question of method of approach,our invitation to Congress ministers to resume office and to representative indians to join your Executive Council, might perhaps be left to the development of thediscussions.

Whether, if such informal conference as I have suggested could cometogether, it might also discuss, in addition to the question of method of approach,our invitatioii to Congress ministers to resume office and to representative indians to join your Executive Council, might perhaps be left to the development of thediscussions.
5. I throw out all this very tentatively and fully realising how short and limited is my experience and how great may be the difference between what looksdesirable at a distance and what is in fact practicable on the spot. In any case should be most grateful for your reactions. You will realise that anything ofthe kind I have outlined would be a sufficient advance upon our recently agreedParliamentary answer to require my securing Cabinet approval.(6)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated June 10, 1940.930-S.  Personal.   Your personal telegram dated 2nd June.   I deliberately-postponed answering so that I could again review the position in my own mind and take certain soundings here.  I have also had the advantage now of commentsin your letter of 30th May.2. I fully accept that in the whole of this matter we must keep an openmind; concentrate on endeavouring to find some way round the real and soliddifficulties that present themselves to advance; and try to think ahead. Atthe same time it is, I am certain, in the light of my own experience of this problem and of its handling, of vital importance not to make a false step, andthe handling day by day of this policy is a matter of real delicacy. Since theoutbreak of war, although prospect of constitutional (% advance) with goodwill of all parties in this country has received some rude shocks, confidence in thebona fides of His Majesty&apos;s Government has, I would have judged, if anything,materially improved in Indian estimation; while the true nature of the obstacles to advance has emerged more clearly; and, much as we may regret the present constitutional deadlock, we have every reason to feel satisfied at the atmosphere of complete peace prevailing through the country, despite suspension ofParliamentary Government over so wide an area, and at relative strength ofour own position after nine months of war in face of the resignation of CongressGovernments.3. As you know we have made very generous offers in the constitutional fieldwithout success. We have too made clear repeatedly the anxiety of the Secretaryof State, the Viceroy and His Majesty&apos;s Government to see the existing deadlockresolved and India&apos;s progress to the constitutional status we have had in viewfor her. The essential obstacles, as we both accept, which have introducedthemselves in these last few months are not of our making but making of Indiansthemselves, and in particular the Congress have to thank their own exaggeratedclaims for the stiffness of the present Moslem attitude, for the emergence of pakistan and the &quot; two nations &quot; theory, and for the position that Jinnah nowoccupies a position which he would be most reluctant to compromise and inwhich I have very little doubt he has the general (? Moslem) feeling behind him.4. The position as it stands to-day is that Congress have not budged inthe slightest degree from their extreme claim for self-determination from theirand for a constitution to be framed on the basis of a broadly elected assemblywith which His Majesty&apos;s Government shall have nothing to do. I have justseen a letter from Nehru to Krishna Menon, dated the 21st May, in which heremarks : &quot; Gandhi has not at any time thought in terms of a small body ofmen deciding anything for India. He sticks completely to his old position;that is, a recognition of Indian independence and a full-blooded..ConstituentAssembly. It is only on the basis of this that he is prepared to talk. But, as ishisjvay, he always says that he is prepared to discuss matters with anybody.&quot;That exactly accords with my own conception of Gandhi&apos;s attitude. On the7th June Maulana Kalam Azad is reported to have stated : &quot; the resumption of office in present circumstances (? is quite) out of the question. Congress formallyadheres to its decisions of the 17th October, 1939.&quot; Rajagopalachari, in a speech on the 8th June urging constitution of stable Ministries in the Provinces,reiterates (suspension [sic] ) our claim that Britain should, as this is supremehour of her difficulty, declare India once and for all-time free and independent,and then India would declare herself as a new-born ally on the side of Englandand France.&quot; Congress, in other words, continues to demand a settlement, buta settlement on its own terms, irrespective of claims of other parties. Its claimto speak for India as a wdiole is patently unreal in face of attitude of Moslem
League, the Mahasabha, the Scheduled Castes, the Liberals, and Princes, andit remains, in my view, important that we should not allow ourselves to be persuaded to accept it merely because of this frequent reiteration of it. Thereis undoubtedly much restlessness in the country at the present official attitude of congress towards the (? war) at a time when (? Indian) feeling generally is with us and anxious to co-operate as fully as possible in prosecution of the war.But Congress machine is indifferent to public now as it has consistently been over the last three or four years.5. In the Moslem Camp Jinnah, as far as (? I can) judge, retains hisascendancy. Relations between him and Sikendar are not good, and neithertrusts the other. Sikendar is more progressive, and prospect of some accommoda-tion between the League and Congress would be better were he in command.But he is not, in my judgment, at this stage strong enough to stand up to Jinnahand the machinery of the Moslem League. Moreover, as Jinnah&apos;s statement ofthe 27th May, repeated by Reuter, shows, clumsy playing of their cards by congress, and statements such as Satyamurtis quoted by him further confirmgeneral Moslem apprehension that what Congress have in view is neither more norless than complete Hindu ascendancy, backed so far as possible by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. While I have never attached, as you (1 know), much importanceto Pakistan as a serious proposition, it is an admirable rallying cry, and thereare signs that it is taking root, particularly amongst the rank and file. TheGeneral Moslem League policy, as was abundantly made clear by LahoreResolutions of last March, is in flat contradiction to that advocated by Congressas stated at Ramgarh and as now reaffirmed by Kalam Azad. And it remainsas important as ever that the fullest weight should be given to the Moslem position at the time when they alone are working the constitution in the Provinces, andwhen their assistance and support is so essential to us both from the military point of view (they provide at the moment 60 per cent, of the army) and becausepossible reactions in other Moslem countries. I am quite certain, too, that anypreliminaries that prejudiced in the least degree a full consideration of the&quot;two India&apos;s &quot; solution at post-war full-dress enquiry, would be violentlyresisted by Moslem League and by Jinnah himself, who would be in a positionto complain that we have promised a radical overhaul of the Act of 1935 atthe end of the war, and that we were now damming the Moslem League prospectof a hearing for claims to which they attach so much importance and which theyhad pressed so strongly.6. The Princes, though I have again pressed them to protect their future byearly acceptance of terms of draft Instrument of Accession, have not the leastdesire, that I can see, for any advance whatever and would be only too content tobe allowed to remain very much as at present (?) if possible with a smaller riskof interference by His Majesty&apos;s Government in their internal government. Thatis not a position that we can accept. At the same time their technical position(? is) exceedingly strong one, based as it is on treaties and undertakings. Theiradherence is, apart from that, essential if Indian unity is to be preserved. nor have we in the past ever been prepared to consider advance at the Centre (? save)on the understanding that the Princes, and the contribution which they wouldmake to balance and conservatism, were in. The Princely attitude towards(? Congress) (and indeed I suspect (% towards) democratic government generally)remains (? as) before they (? insist on the) fullest acceptance of their own treaty,&amp;c., rights and on the fullest safeguards for their point of view in any new con-stitution to which they are to be parties. And we cannot, force them against their will into any new scheme, or ignore their interests and claims in devising one.7. The position of the only pieces on the board that matter being as I have described (? omission) have not referred to the Europeans, but their are directly and deeply concerned over commercial interests; or to large bodies of opinion, suchas those represented by Mahasabha, who repudiate Congress claim to speak forthem, or to the scheduled castes which it would be most dangerous to leave to thetender mercies of Congress) the problem of any advance in existing conditions isone of extreme difficulty. It is essential to choose right moment for any move. Ihave to bear in mind continually too (a) That there is a limit to the extent to which Viceroy can wisely takeinitiative.  I am not so much concerned about any question of prestige(to which I attach little importance), as that &quot;repeated failures by[21548] &apos; c
Viceroy to secure any advance as a result of these moves may diminish the value of action by him and impair his position as a mediator ornegotiator.(b) If I do make a move and get these people together only to find thatno agreement is possible (and that is what I should anticipate atpresent), that may well set back still further the prospect of any earlyaccommodation. Both parties will have entrenched themselves stillmore deeply as a result of such abortive discussions, communal feelingmay well be accentuated and so far from having contributed to advance,our intervention will have had exactly the opposite effect.(c) It is of real importance to avoid any suggestion that we are making a move merely because we have got our backs to the wall in Westerncampaign, and that in consequence we are likely to be more amenable to pressure here.8. I recognise the attractiveness of the scheme you discuss in your letter and I have examined it with entire sympathy with its object.   But I do notbelieve that ar^adyaiu^e-is^ifeelyHm^tbAt-.basis a,t. present.....time.  &apos;1 willTseepit in-TnYnd&quot; The time may come when it could be tried out, with greater hopeof success that I see at the moment. But I am sure that, were we to take iton now, it would lead us nowhere. Even if we got a gathering together and itsexamination of possible alternatives produced any (? sort) of agreed conclusions,which I doubt, there would be immediate pressure to implement those conclusions.It seems to me out of the question to get down to details of constitution-makingat a time like the present when whole energies of the country are concentrated on the war.9. My own conclusion is regretfully that we should continue as before, andshould make no move until circumstances (? are) more propitious for one, andthere is some likelihood that it would produce results of value. While we mustregret the existence of deadlock, and continue to seek for a way out of it, it isquite clear that if analysis suggested in my telegram of 1st June is a correctone, the state of things as there described may be not altogether unsatisfactoryto Congress, Moslem League, and to extent that there is no interference withprosecution (? of) the war, ourselves. Much play is being made in Congress presswith addition to our war effort which would result from a (? settlement). but apart from the fact that settlement envisaged would be one on Congress terms and so likely to produce difficulties with other parties, I am inclined myself to doubt real validity of this argument plausible as it necessarily appears. i recognise that Congress, if they could start a mass movement, have a considerablenuisance value; but that cannot stop my war effort here, nor does their aloofnessin the slightest degree limit that war effort which is basically conditioned byarms and equipment, and by limits of training facilities. At the same time Ithink it quite possible that before very long there may be sufficient pressurebrought to bear inside Congress on Working Committee to make that bodyslightly more accommodating. There are clear signs that important personalitiessuch as Asaf Ali, Satyamurti, Rajendra Prasad not only are discontented withthe unreality of Congress attitude towards the war, but are maintaining theirattitude despite sharp rebukes from Kalam Azad and others. This trend ofopinion may well turn out to be more important than it seems to be at the moment and I am watching it carefully. Broadly speaking, my own attitude, as it has consistently been is that I must keep in closest &quot;touch with currents ofopinion here, retain an entirely open mind, as to (? a) solution, and lose no opportunity that looks to me like admitting of being turned to advantage tobring one about. But equally I am quite certain that course of wisdom is to hasten very slowly and not to try to force the pace. I should in these circum-stances be very strongly averse from any movement on our part at the presenttime, and on the best judgment I can at this stage form I do not anticipate (? thatwe are) likely to have reason to regret marking (? time) I will discuss further in my next private letter.
. 11(7)Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor-General, dated June 17, 1940.754. Personal. Your telegram dated 10th June, 930-S. I cannot helpfeeling that I may have failed in the telegram to which you were replying tomake clear to you my ideas and that your objections to furthering the plan I asked-you to consider are to some extent based on misapprehension of my intentionsIndeed, I hope that this is the case, since I feel that we should incur a graveresponsibility if we let slip an opportunity that may not recur of resolving thepresent deadlock, which seems practically certain to continue until some initiativeby you provides, the possibility of a way out; and, in any case, the spontaneousreactions in India to the crisis in the West surely entitle her to look to herGovernment for a lead in the direction of united effort.2. I wish, therefore, to urge upon you most strongly the reconsideration ofyour position, but on the basis of a revised plan. Plan I now wish you to consideris that you should yourself forthwith make an appeal to the leaders of all parties on the same lines as that made by myself in my statement in the House ofCommons on 23rd May inviting them to meet you for the purpose of considering whether, in the situation of peril in which India no less than France and GreatBritain now finds herself, they cannot agree to discuss amongst themselves ways and means of reaching sufficient accommodation to enable Ministries to resumeoffice with common consent in the Provinces and to enable political leaders tojoin your Executive Council with the general purpose of placing India in aposition of active and conscious co-operation in the Allies&apos; effort to crushHitlerism. I suggest that you should make it plain that response to this appeal would be provisional and (as has been the case with the recent all-party recon-struction in this country) entirely without prejudice to any principles to whichthe several parties have committed themselves during the discussions of the past few months. It is no doubt possible that Congress representatives may meet suchan appeal with a blank refusal except on the terms which they have beendemanding throughout. The recent utterances )rou have reported to me byAbul Kalam Azad, Nehru and Rajagopalachariar are obvious indications ofthis possibility. But, if this line were taken by the Congress leaders, I should hope that such an attitude might at the present time find so little support from public opinion in India that it could not be maintained, and I find confirmationfor this view in paragraph 4 of your telegram.3. I am sanguine enough to hope, therefore, that an appeal on these lines and with this limited scope might meet with sufficient response to serve theimmediate purpose of replacing deadlock by active co-operation, and if so it is justpossible that nothing further would be demanded of us for the time being. i recognise the probability, however, that Congress if not the Moslems may demandsome indication of our further intentions either as a condition of entering on discussions for provisional accommodation or as the result of starting them. Wemust be in a position, therefore, to meet such a demand, and the general policy Ishould be prepared to announce in response to it, provided always that the Cabinetagree, would be on the following lines :  (i) It is our desire and intention to enable a united India to attain as soonas practicable its natural and rightful position as a partner-member inthe British Commonwealth of Nations on the same footing of indepen-dence as the United Kingdom and the Dominions.&apos;(ii) We recognise the right of India herself to frame the permanent structure of the Constitution under which as such a partner-member in theCommonwealth she is to regulate her own affairs.(iii) For the purpose of adopting and ratifying such a constitution on India&apos;behalf some form of constituent body will clearly be necessary. We areprepared to see such a body set up immediately after the war if thenecessary mutual agreements to produce it are forthcoming from theleading elements in the present national life of India.(iv) We should be prepared to accept the provisions of any constitutionadopted by such a constituent body as the permanent structure of thenew Indian polity, but subject for a stated period of years to such- adjustments and modifications as might be required to enable GreatBritain to fulfil the obligations which her long connection with india has imposed upon her. The extent and nature of such modifications[21548] D
and adjustments would, of course, depend upon the extent to whichthe Constitution which emerged from the constituent body took account of these obligations and enabled them to be fulfilled; but we contemplate that they should continue to be exercised through theprovisions of an Instrument of Agreement as between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the constituent body on behalf of the new Governmentof India. The Agreement would be an integral part of the indian constitution and enter into force concurrently with it. The-Agreement would run for a stated period of years and would berenewable by negotiation in the last year of each period,(v) The obligations referred to in the preceding paragraphs are for theDefence of India as part of the Empire; for security for the serviceof the sterling debt; for sufficient control of the public servicesrecruited by the Secretary of State to secure their reasonable rightsincluding their right to the career for which they were recruited,fresh recruitment by the Secretary of State being, however, terminatedon the commencement of the new constitution; the maintenance of adequate commercial safeguards; the fulfilment of obligations to theStates in so far as the States are not completely incorporated in thenew Dominion of India.4. At the appropriate moment after such a statement of policy had beenmade my idea is that you should suggest (or better, procure if possible that thesuggestion were made to you) that all Parties should without prejudice andwithout being in any way committed to their conclusions, consent to, andparticipate in, the setting up of a small group of persons competent afterimpartial and objective study of the problems, to tender advice and guidance totheir principals and to the Indian public on the difficult questions of the natureof the constituent body to be set up; the means of setting it up; and theprocedure by which it should arrive at its decisions. On all of these problems and, indeed, on the basic question whether parliamentary democratic governmentis suited to India the discussions of the past few months have disclosed and emphasised a deep cleavage of view which will certainly not be lessened by further long-range reasseveration of the contending principles. The efforts ofsuch a body, bent on reconciling, if possible, the points of conflict and approachingthem ale novo and from a new angle, might prove the first step towards bridgingthese conflicts.5. Since no constituent body can be expected to succeed in producing a constitution from a clean slate, it must be provided with well-prepared material in the form of an outline plan, or perhaps alternative plans, to form the basisof its deliberations. This task also might be undertaken by the suggestedpreliminary enquiry group if it succeeded in its primary task of producing a.nacceptable plan for a constituent body, but possibly after additions to, or changesin, its personnel had been made in order to ensure that it contained the besttalent available. It could be made clear that, while the Act of 1935 is one of the elements to be considered, the enquiry should be free to examine the whole problem-of Indian Governments, Central and Provincial, its executive and legislative,methods of procedure from the foundations.6. The problem of bringing the States into any such plan as I have sketchedof course raises large issues. I do not see how we could omit any reference tothe States in our enumeration of the obligations arising out of our longconnection with India. Even if we did, that would not dispose of the problemof securing the participation of the States in a plan for the self-government ofIndia. It has been the underlying assumption of any plan hitherto conceivedby us that it should embrace the States, and that they should have a part in framing it. This, indeed, seems to be now generally recognised; even by theCongress, though there is dispute as to whether the voice of the States in framing the Constitution is to be that of the Rulers or of their subjects. There are two alternative methods of approach to the main problem : (a) British India might be invited to frame its own constitution on theassumption that we should subsequently endeavour in the negotiation of the Instrument of Agreement to secure such modifications andadaptations of it as would enable the States to adhere, and at the sametime secure for them such a position in the Constitution as we considered constitute with their just rights; or
(b) The States would themselves take an effective part from the start in theconstruction of a Constitution designed to cover from the outset notonly British India, but the States as well.On this latter plan it might still be necessary for the. British Government tosecuie by the Instrument of Agreement the means of safeguarding the special interest of the Rulers.In my own view, it is greatly preferable that the latter alternative shouldbe adopted, and that we should therefore endeavour to secure the participation of the States in the proposed preliminary examination group referred to inparagraph 4 above, if your discussions reached the stage of setting up such a body, with a view to their being ultimately represented in any constituent body which may come into being. I suggest that practical considerations, apart fromthe awkwardness that, might arise from questions of status, would render italmost essential that, if the States are represented on either body, their represen-tation on the preliminary study group at all events should be through selectedMinisters, and the existence of a recognised Committee of Ministers shouldfacilitate this. A Prince who joined the group could hardly avoid committing himself and his State, and would thus be at a disadvantage as compared with hisBritish Indian colleagues.7. Of course, the Princes may refuse to take advantage of any such offer.I should myself feel that any such refusal would not justify abandonment of myscheme so far as British Indian participation is concerned, and that (if theStates were the only recusants) a purely British Indian study group should, none the less, be invited in considering the problem to take account of the States andto make provision for them in the Constitution. It should be apparent to the princes at how great a disadvantage they would be on any such arrangement ascompared with participation from the outset. I suggest that their participationmight be facilitated if you were to appoint a States&apos; Representative as one of thenew Members of your Executive Council; indeed, in any case, I should regard this as desirable.(8)Cypher Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated June 16, 1940.(Important.)753. Private and Personal. My personal telegram of to-day, No. 754.If you still feel difficulty about taking suggested initiative yourself.&quot; would youprefer that it should come as from me and from the Cabinet? In any case, Ishould be grateful for as early a reply as possible.(9)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State for India, dated june 20, 194.0.1010-S. Personal. Your personal telegram dated 16th June, No. 754.I fear I am still unconvinced by your proposals even in their modified form.I do not propose, however, to discuss them in great detail for the moment. In thelight of the French collapse and possible more serious developments (Spain, &amp;c.)in future, I have to-day written to Gandhi to ask him to come and see me atbeginning of next week. I have explained that I have no new constructiveproposal to put to him, but wish to discuss general situation freely and frankly,and that his help would be of great value to me in that connection. I have to-dayreceived a letter from Jinnah forwarding latest Moslem League resolutions and asking if I wished to see him to explain them. I am replying asking him to come and see me at the end of next week. Indications are now that Jinnah would beready to agree to Moslem League entering my Council even if Congress refuse,but a situation in which Congress remained out while other parties were represented would not be free from difficulty from our point of view.
2. These conversations will give me an opportunity of probing the mindsboth of Gandhi and of Jinnah without committing us in any way as to procedureor anything else. When I have done so I shall be in a better position to adviseyou further, and I will let you have my views in detail. I may invite a repre-sentative of Mahasabha to see me, but not, I think, for the moment. I will bearin mind in my conversations with Gandhi and Jinnah your suggestion as to someexploratory phase or study group; but I shall be agreeably surprised if either ofthem is prepared to play on the basis of a temporary suspension of politicaldifferences. I am taking opportunity of my broadcast to-night (text of which isbeing telegraphed to you by Reuter) to make an appeal in most general terms forsinking political differences during this time of trial and for coming together forthe common effort.Cypher Teleqram from Secretary of State to Governor-General, dated june 22, 1940.798. Personal. Many thanks for your telegram of 20th June. I am a littleregretful of the further delay which must ensue before we take our decisions.I imagine we shall be in July before I receive your considered views. On theother hand, I do not wish to question that you are well advised to take preliminarysoundings in which you will no doubt stress that India should unite not only in her own defence, but against dominance of evil forces in the world, and that youare anxious for united Indian support not for present limited war effort, but for something far transcending it and more essentially Indian in character. I stillfear, however, that we shall not make much progress with Gandhi unless we can assure him that there is a definite date in prospect, namely, immediately aftertermination of war for any Indian constitutional convention whose composition and powers parties can meanwhile agree upon. In any case, whatever immediateupshot of conversations, I trust you can so conclude them as still to leave the dooropen for procedure suggested in my personal telegrams Nos. 754 and 753.However, you must use your own judgment, and I am sure you will do what you can to let me have your final conclusions with as little delay as possible.
