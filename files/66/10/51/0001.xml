At their 230th Meeting on the 23rd July the Chiefs ofStaff Committee had before them a report by the Joint PlanningSub-Committee (C .0 .S. (40)^5&quot; J.P. ) on instructions to toe sentto the Acting Governor, Singapore? concerning the internmentof Japanese subjects in certain circumstances.      (A copy of atelegram from the Acting Governor in which this question hadbeen raised is attached as Annex 1.)     The Chiefs of staff committee agreed that the Acting Governor should be authorised,at his discretion, to intern all Japanese in Malaya immediatelyhe had sure knowledge that Japan had embarked on openhostilities against the British Empire, irrespective of whetherwar had &quot;been formally declared.2.      For political reasons, however, the Foreign office were not prepared to agree to the despatch of instructions onthese lines;    it is understood that their principal reasonwas that it might be desirable, in the event of any hostile action by Japan, xto attempt to localise the effect of suchaction and avoid, total war between the British Empire and japan.      It was felt that the wholesale internment of Japanesein Malaya on the Acting Governor&apos;s own discretion might precipitate total war.3.     Discussions took place between the Departmentsconcerned with a view to reaching agreement as to the natureof the instructions to be sent to the Acting Governor, butas agreement could not be reached an interim reply was senton the 5th August.      (Annex 2.)4.      I now circulate the draft of a further telegram tothe Acting Governor.      (Annex 3.)      It will be seen that this draft contains two alternative versions of the final paragraph.The version marked &quot;A&quot; is that preferred by the service departments and follows the recommendation of the Chiefs cfStaff.     The version marked &quot;B&quot;  is that preferred by theForeign Office.     The matter was considered further by theChiefs of Staff Committee at their 263rd meeting on the14th August, when the Committee adhered to their previous view,5.     For my part I agree with the Foreign Office view and-I recommend that approval be given for the despatch of atelegram to the Acting Governor as in the annexed draft.with alternative &quot;B&quot; for paragraph 6.Colonial Office,19th August, 1940.

ANNEX 1.Telegram from Officer Administering the Government of theStraits Settlements.Dated 12th July.     Received 3.37 p,m. , 12th July, 1940.No.  185 Government House   SecreteDutch authorities have communicated us their &quot;belief in the existence of?draft plans for the organized sabotageand resistance to arrest in the event of war,      I have no evidence of translation of such plans here but they are obviously possible and in view of the numerical strength ofthe Japanese community and likewise of secret possession ofarms about which we can do nothing, it is of utmost importance that we should be in the position to arrest at earliestpossible moment before they get word to act.      If we have to wait for formal notification from you of the existence ofthe state of the war it is likely that Japanese here will movefirst thus greatly increasing the dangers and the difficultiesoCommander in Chief China Station lias arranged for very earlydirect notification either of act of war at Kong Kong orof action being taken by Hong Kong authorities againstJapaneiset residents there and it has been suggested that suchnotification would justify the initiation of action here.      Iforesee however the danger of magnification of an incident andof precipitation of state of war which might have been avoided.      I shall be grateful if importance of my receivingauthority of arrest for internment before formal notification of state of war can be considered and express instructions begiven to me in what circumstances I may take action.

Telegram to Officer Administering the Government of theStraits Settlements., &apos;Sent 5 p., m0 on 5th August, 194-0.No0 804 SecreteYour telegram Noe 186 Government HousecThis matter raises difficult questions of highpolicy which are under consideration here hut I hope to replyin a day or two.     Meanwhile please ascertain if possible from the Dutch authorities whether they have any details of thdraft plans which they &quot;believe to exists      I presume that forsuch purposes Japanese residents would he organised in cellsand if so that the Malayan authorities have some knowledge ofthe system and its members0      I presume that your security service is fully efficient to deal with any problem of thiskind and that it would be a fairly simple matter to preventscheme of the kind feared from developing seriously,,I am not quite clear as to significance of yourobservation about secret possession of arms by Japanese but i assume this does not mean possible existence of secret store-sof arms in quantity,,     I trust also that the strictestpossible control is being exercised over traffic in ammunition and explosives,,I shall be glad to have your observations on abovepointso

ANNEX draft telegram to Officer Administering the Government oxthe Straits Settlements.No,        SECRET.My telegram No. 804.     Internment of Japanese,I fully appreciate the importance of the problem on which youseek instructions and it has been examined &quot;both from themilitary and political aspects, but as indicated in my telegram,under reference it raises questions of high policy.2.     The considerations which weigh most withHis Majesty1s Government vis-a-vis Japan in present circumstanceare that (a) war must be avoided if possible (b) the securityof Singapore is vital to our interests in the Far East.     the inherent difficulty of the problem is to fix upon measureswhich though securing us in one object will not prejudice theother.3.      Circumstances in which serious hostilities with japan might break out are various and might well not include any formal declaration of war,     Nor can it be assumed that itwould be certain that you would have twenty-four hours&apos; notice that war with Japan was considered inevitable though everyeffort would be made to send such notice and telegraphic priornotification of seriously strained relations should be possible at least.4.     Further it is not inevitable that if serious incidents of a local character with Japan took place even in british territory, they would necessarily at once develop into totalwar with the British Empire.      If it should be in our interests to localise the effect of such incidents it would be very undesirable that general outbreak should be precipitated bywholesale internment of Japanese in Malaya.5.      I have referred in my telegram No. 804 to theimportance of maintaining your Security Service at a high   stateof efficiency.     Essential measures in all practicable ways forprevention of sabotage by Japanese or other persons, such asguarding of vulnerable points and suspension of employment of potential enemy nationals, -if any, in vital services have nodoubt been fully prepared already.     Final steps to implementsuch schemes need not of course be delayed for notification ofimminent outbreak of war with Japan.      It is necessary, ifthis has not already been done, that a detailed programme should be worked out as regards the action to be taken byauthorities in Malaya on receipt of notification that relationswith Japan were seriously strained.     The detention howeverof particular persons (whether Japanese or others)  suspected of being engaged or about to engage in activities prejudicial to the public interest is permissible at any time under yourpresent powers.      Limited action of this character againstringleaders is not open to the same risk of compromisingHis Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s decision as wholesale internment of japanese in Malaya at critical juncture of Anglo-japanese relations in general.Alternative A.

Alternative A.6.     If it became quite obvious to yourself and/or to theNaval Commander-in-Ohief that Japan had actvtally embarked uponopen hostilities against the British Empire (with or wiThotfiT&apos;any formal declaraction of war) Japanese in Malaya should betreated as enemy aliens and liable without question to be interned, detained or deported, but unless the position isplainly obvious then in the absence of definite instructions from His Majesty1 s Government general internment of Japanesenationals in Malaya as enemy aliens should take place only after reference to me.Alternative B.6.     Except in the case of a direct attack on Malaga by japan you should not (repeat not) goto length! of generalinternment of Japanese without prior reference to me, unlessbefore then you have received authority to take such actionon your own responsibility in certain defined circumstances and those circumstances have in fact come about.
