COPY HO.. Ag^(40) 284. \   /EOMBARDrnPNT POLICY IN FRANCE.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.Revised instructions governing the conduct of all forms of bombardment were approved by the War Cabinet on 3rd June, 1940.    These instructions are attached as an appendix.    Since that date approval has been given for thefollowing modifications covering objectives in France and in french territorial waters.(a) On 6th July the War Cabinet approved a papersubmitted by the First Lord of the Admiralty(W.P.(40) 202 (Revise)) which states in Annex Ias regards air attack, that :-&quot;Any ship at anchor inside the territorial waters (i.e. &quot;within 3 miles of the coast) of enemy-occupied territory or alongside in any european port in his possession may be attacked.&quot;(W.M. (40) 195, Item 2)(b) On 26th June the War Cabinet approved the attack of&quot;Oil supplies in parts of France which had  .been occupied by the Germans and where theGermans were using the aerodromes,    (inpractice this might mean that at the presenttime attacks could be carried out on oil supplies in territory north of, say, theLoire but not, for example, in the Bordeauxarea.)&quot;(W.M. (40) 183, Item 9)This ruling excludes two important oil refineriesin the Gironde area (near Bordeaux) both ofwhich are well removed from residential areas ofany consequence, but appears to include oil stocks in Paris which has been declared an opentown.(c) On 27th June the Secretary of State for Air was invited to prepare plans for the attack ofcertain aircraft and aero-engine factories in french territory occupied by the Germans.    the plans were &quot;not to be put into operation without .further reference to the War Cabinet&quot;..  (W.M. (40) 184)These plans have now been prepared.    In the viewof the AH- Staff, however, these are unlikely to be profitable targets as compared with corresponding objectives in Germany.

2. It has been the accepted practice since the Frencharmistice to attack any purely military objective in occupied France,,    But some doubt exists with regard tothe attack of communication targets.    With the exceptionof one attack on a railway, attacks on communicationshave so far been confined to barges on the canals.    TheGermans are undoubtedly using French railways fortransporting troops and military stores between Germanyand bases in north-west France;    It is, however,impossible for aircraft to identify enemy troop or supplytrains, though it may be a reasonable assumption that theenemy will not allow civilians to travel by train at night in the occupied areas03. I now ask the authority of the War Cabinet forthe Air Force to attack any military objectives in occupied France as defined in paragraph 4 of the Appendix,modified in respect of shipping as indicated inparagraph 1(a) above04. It may be that these objectives will beconsidered too general.    In this event I suggest thatthe Air Force be authorised to attack the following catergories of objectives in occupied FranceI. (a) Military forces including naval auxiliaries of whatever description and,whether or notattendant on the fleet; troop transports andmilitary supply ships whether at sea or in port,(NOTE: Areas in which all shipping can be treatedas enemy transports or military supplyships will be specially notified)(The areas notified are stated in Annex I to W,P.(40)202 Revise and as regards the territorial waters of occupied France are subject to the proviso that onlyships at^nchor or alongside within territorialwatersHfia e&apos;&quot;&apos;within&quot;three miles of the coast) of enemy occupied territory may be attacked).(b) Military works and fortificationse(c) Military establishments and depots includingbarracks, camps, billets and naval dockyards;aerodromes, whether designated military or civil; stores and dumps of military supplies.II.    Oil producing plants and storage installationssouth as well as north of the Loire.III.   Lines of communication and transportation (includingtrains) and means of inter-communication servingmilitary purposes,5. The War Cabinet are aware that there are certainextremely important military objectives in unoccupied France,notably the oil plants in the Marseilles - Frontignanarea, which should be destroyed.    (See W.P.  (40) 267,para. 6 (b), and war.  (40) 266, para. 5).

It would not &quot;be in accordance with our policy inpresent, circumstances to destroy these objectives by airor naval bombardments    I recommend however that immediate consideration should be given to the possibility of theirdemolition by other means.(Intld) A,S.Air Ministry,Whitehall, S.W.1,22nd July. 1940.
