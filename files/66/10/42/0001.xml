DECLARATION QF DANGEROUS AREAS IN- - - - -        the &apos;English&quot;ci-iamsE&quot;&quot;ahe &apos;&apos;.che &quot;bay of fiscay.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralt;Recent- reports arid reconnaissances have shown that thereis an aopreciable movement of shipping along the FrenchAtlantic Coasts.     There are also indications that the enemy   -is establishing naval hases in German Occupied France.   It istherefore to be expected.that naval. auxiiiarie^&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;wiIJJ&apos; fie employeein these waters and that they will wear French colours.German shipping at present sheltering in Spanish and other neutral ports may well endeavour to reach French Atlantic portsunder the guise of French or other false colours.   Moreover,since the ports of the Bay of Biscay are further removed from attack by our aircraft there is a possibility of French andGerman shipping being collected in these ports for an invasion of Ireland, of the West Country, or even of the Atlantic Island:2.        At present, our submarines are allowed to sink at sightin 2 areas, one in the North Sea, East of the East Coast minebarrier, the other in the Mediterranean within 30 miles of the libyan Coasts.   It is now desired to declare areas borderingthe Channel and Atlantic Coasts of France as dangerous to navigation and then to lay mines and to allow our submarines to sink at sight in those areas.     A similar freedom of action should, presumably, be extended to aircraft.     The proposed areas are(A) The waters of the English Channel to the eastward of the line drawn from the Bishop&apos;s RockLight (Lat.490 52&apos; North, Long. 6o 27&apos; West) tothe Chaussee de Sein (Lat. 480 03.41 North, Long05o 05&apos; West approximately).(B) All waters in the Bay of Biscay lying to the eastward of the line drawn from the Chaussee de Sein(Lat.48o 03.4&apos; North, Long 050 05&apos; West approx:)to Le Socoa Light (Lat. 430 23-7&apos; North, Long 01o41.2&apos; West).3-        Apart from the question of French shipping, there seemnow to be no more neutral ships navigating off the French channel and Atlantic Coasts than there are in the North Sea and SkaggerakJust/

2? fthi i-j WJuat as a few Swedish or Baltic coasters may venture forth in the North Sea Zone,  so a few Spanish coasters may ventureout in the Bay of Biscay.      In either case the vessels willhe engaged in enemy lousiness.      Sea-going neutral shipping inthe zones now proposed may he said to have ceased withthe exception of ships serving our own ports.      I suggestthat the military position in these zones is comparable to that in the Forth   Sea Zone,  and that it is reasonable to assume that all shipping off the French WesternSeaboard is under the enerny&apos;s control and engaged directly or indirectly in furthering the enemy!s war preparations.U.      The proposed area in the Bay of Biscay does notinfringe Spanish territorial waters nor does it imperilneutral shipping voyaging to Spain or Portugal.      In theChannel area we do not at present intend to lay mines exceptin the enemy&apos;s waters hut the declaration of the whole area will, we hope, sow doubt in the minds of the enemy as towhether we are laying offensive or defensive minefields;,All ships sailing to and from United Kingdom ports willhe directed to obtain routeing instructions to take them through the area.      Moreover orders to sink at sightin the Channel will he issued at the discretion of the local commanders-in-Chief who will ensure that ships engagedin our own trade are not thereby endangered.5.      I desire to emphasise that, although thedeclaration of these zones as dangerous will incidentallyassist our patrols in their blockade of Europe, the proposals in this paper spring from the naval and military situation&quot;in the areas concerned.6.      I ask the Cabinet to approve my proposals.7.      Annexed hereto are:-(1) The draft of instructions toCommanders-in-Chief at Home andto Vice-Admiral (S).(2) The draft of a notificationto neutral Governments.A. V. A.

It is the intention to commerce laying offensive minefields inthe waters bordering the enemy&apos;s coasts in these areas immediately uponpublication of the warning6 and without further declaration.
