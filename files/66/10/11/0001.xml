P. (G.) (40) 184).Paragraph 1 of the revised draft statement briefly recites the reasons whichactuate the Secretary of State in bringing forward, at this moment, proposalsfor a fresh declaration of policy in respect of Indian constitutional reform. Itsuggests that the people of India are not throwing their efforts whole-heartedlyinto the war, and that some further political temptation is immediately necessaryin order to induce them to do so.Whilst it is, of course, true that Congress is not co-operating actively inj India&apos;s war effort, too much importance need not perhaps be attributed to thatI fact, bearing in mind the enormous decline in Congress membership that has recently taken place in India as well as the fact that even when Congress did\ co-operate in 1914, it afforded little, if any, military or economic aid ofI importance.   The effective military and economic assistance given by HindusI in the last war was mainly derived from Princes on the one hand and fromMarwari, Gujerati and Bania elements of Hindu society on the other, all of which,it is understood, are co-operating as whole-heartedly in this war as they did inthe last.   The same, is, of course, even more importantly true of Mussulmansupport in the Punjab and throughout India.   It would not, therefore, seemso far as this paragraph is concerned, that the arguments used support the urgentconstitutional steps now proposed.Paragraph 2 states &quot; the firm intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government toI accord to India &apos; at the earliest practicable moment after the war &apos; the righti to control her own affairs and shape her own destiny.&apos; &quot;The Secretary of State clearly bases his proposals on the assumption thatI confidence in His Majesty&apos;s Government can be restored in India by a definitedeclaration that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend, at the earliest opportunity,phh further to dissociate themselves from the guidance and control of Indianaffairs and to substitute for that guidance that of an elected Indian majority.1     It might well be argued that it is rather, on the contrary, the increasing fearl\/r ^e ?ar^ 0^ ^e Mussulmans, non-Brahmins and depressed classes lest HislMajesty&apos;s Government should totally abandon all control of internal affairs in*tnn0Ur 0^ an e^8C^ec^ maj ority that is causing increasing disquiet at the present[ ]        -
If this be so and the evidence to this effect is strong is it not time were-examine whether we do in fact, with the evidence now before us, nourish &apos;&apos; the firm intention &quot; recited in this paragraph? Here is no question of progress orreaction, but a question of the provision of decent orderly .and just governmentfor millions of helpless people committed to our charge, as against government by a Hindu &quot;majority,&quot; admitted by the Secretary of State himself to bepossessed of no valid democratic or liberal meaning. It is also a question of the strategic safety of the Empire and of the economic welfare of wage-earners in.this country, all of whom, for one reason or another, have a right to be considered in this tremendous decision.It is, moreover, a fact that opinion is still strongly divided in this country,and it is equally probable that if the full strategic and economic implications of the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals were made clear to the Dominions and crown colonies they, too, would be informed with a grave disquiet.We may do well here to enquire what is, in fact, really meant by the phrase&apos;&apos; shaping her own destiny.&apos;&apos; If words mean anything at all they must here mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government^ &quot; firm &quot;intention &quot; is to give Indian politicians and Hindu politicians at that carte blanche to direct India&apos;s future in anyway they choose. The words must mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government is willing that India should be free, for instance, to declare her complete inde-pendence which indeed is Congress&apos;s declared intention or to substitute fordemocracy a system of autocracy possibly on the Nazi pattern, or even to allyherself with an enemy Power against us. Is it then in very fact our &apos;&apos; firmintention&quot; to allow, if occasion arise, these things to happen? If not, Clause 2is not only meaningless but is actually misleading. In any case the phrase&apos;&apos; shaping her own destiny&apos;&apos; is not only incompatible with, but hostile to, the reservations set forth in the succeeding paragraph in respect of our vitalobligations. Obviously no country is free to 1&apos; shape its own destiny &apos;&apos; when sheis mistress neither of her own defences nor of the conduct of her foreign relations.It is submitted that we can no longer, without grave hurt to ourselves and toIndia, go on enunciating political phrases Avithout being certain that wedefinitely mean to honour their fullest implication.Paragraph 3 mentions certain obligations in respect of which it asserts rathervaguely that His Majesty&apos;s Government are &quot;bound to make provision,&quot; butomits all reference to some of the most important of the special obligations.Our special obligations in India may be divided into external and internal;external, those that merely concern India&apos;s relations with the United Kingdomand the Empire, and internal, those that relate solely to India&apos;s domesticadministration.Of the external, three only are specifically mentioned ,in this paper, viz.defence, foreign affairs and the rights of the public services. Nothing, however,is said -about a matter of great importance to employment in this country, viz.,* Government trade discrimination provided for in the Government of India Act, or the Serviceof India Act, Qf the Debt.*an^llT 116 0f ^e interior obligations, those to the princes are referred to as amongstour &quot; principal obligations,&quot; but nothing whatever is said about obligations whichare perhaps more binding and important than all the others put together, namely,our responsibilities for the protection of minorities. There are of course greatminorities like the Mussulman and non-Brahmin minorities, little but loyalminorities like the Anglo-Indians, huge but helpless minorities like the depressed classes and untouchables-all of whom were provided for in some degree in theGovernment of India Act, but which enjoy no mention in the proposals underreview.Paragraph 4. The implications of the first part of paragraph 4 have alreadybeen discussed under paragraph 2, and the latter part of the paragraph will bedealt with under paragraph 6.Paragraph 5 clearly stultifies the positive proposals made in paragraphs2and 4. In view of the recent discussion in the Cabinet it would be superfluoushere to reiterate the mischief caused by periodical high sounding pronouncements* The Government of India owes ue a sum of, very roughly speaking, some 400 millions,whilst private capital invested in India may be computed at anothar 600 millions_say some,000 million pounds sterling in ail.     1 ,   , c;  %
as to the liberties we are eager to confer upon India provided that internal &quot;agree-ment &quot; is achieved. Anyone who has any intimate knowledge of Indian conditions is well aware that such agreement is unhappily, for the space of any period thatwe can reasonably foresee, entirely impossible of achievement.It is also difficult to understand on what evidence the Secretary of State hasbecome convinced either that &quot; agreement is possible &quot; or that it is even desired by the &quot;vast majority of the people of India.&quot; Congress has frankly andrepeatedly and as recently as the 22nd March of this year stated its unalterableopposition to the Secretary of State&apos;s policy ;t moreover, the Working Committeeof Congress so lately as the 15th June lastt. unanimously reindorsed Congress&apos;earlier decision for complete independence and for nothing less than independence.The Muslim League has repeatedly stated that, it will have nothing to do witha Government composed of a Hindu majority and has preferred a Pakistan policyof Muslim isolation in preference to an agreement with Congress or to the present policy of the Government of India, whilst the non-Brahmin, depressed classes anduntouchables have incessantly prayed for protection from any systemof rule that would put them under Brahmin supremacy. In adverse circumstancessuch as these constitutional proposals of such far-reaching import, which are dependent on an agreement whose early realisation is not even problematical,would seem to be both misleading and impolitic.Paragraph 6. I have referred under Paragraph 3 to the omission of any reference to or provision for the Service of the Debt under the Secretary of State&apos;sproposals. This question has an important relationship to Paragraph 6 andthe Instrument of Agreement. We should presumably have to insist that theService of the Debt were provided for in the Instrument, and it is not clear whatwould happen to its interest if the Instrument only provided for a period ofyears. That there would be an organised attempt to justify default if congress were in power there is no question. The rupee ratio agitation has indeed alwaysbeen designed to produce a situation where default could be justified, and the bearing of this question both upon our trade and our financial position shouldbe not lost sight of. The lowering of the rupee from Is. Qd. to Is. 4d. and there might well be an agitation for still further reduction is equivalentto an addition to the tariff of 11 per cent, and of an export bountyof 11 per cent. also. In addition to this it adds correspondingly to the rupeecost of remitting sterling to pay interest on the Debt. Some measure of theimportance of this question to United Kingdom trade and employment will beseen when the issue is put in simpler language : the result in effect of a lowering of the rupee is : (1) To make it more difficult for our goods to go to India,(2) To make it easier for Indian goods to come to us.(3) To make it harder for India to pay us her debts.The moment India became mistress of her own currency, which would obviously be the case under the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals, these matters would becomeof immediate gravity and urgency.But the terms in Paragraph 3 regarding His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsresponsibilities and obligations in particular defence and foreign policy andparamountcy^ relate to matters of high prerogative which have never been defined by Statute, and the suggestion in Paragraph 6 that they should be reduced towriting in the form of an Instrument of Agreement is startling. It would meanfor the first time that these prerogatives were, in the language of the privy council, &quot; merged in the Statute&quot; in other words submerged, and, as a result,limited by the Statute. This would be nothing less than a surrender of the legalbasis on which the authority of the Crown in India has always rested.1$ find it also difficult to understand how His Majesty&apos;s Government can enterinto an Instrument of Agreement except with another Government alreadyconstituted. The Crown cannot treat with its own subjects, whether assembledm a Convention or otherwise, and it seems to me likely that if this strangeprocedure were adopted it would at once be exploited by Congress as an admissiontnat the Crown did recognise that actual claim of Congress to sovereign inde-pendence which it is the very object of Paragraph 3 to avoid.

words, the proposed agreement cannot be in the first place a real agreement,because in the absence of a legally constituted Government in India there wouldexist only one party to it. Presumably, therefore, the machinery of the IrishTreaty would be followed, and in the first place the agreement would be Articlesfor a Treaty. The Irish precedent, however, does not give great hope that whenthe legally constituted Government of India does come into being it will preserveintact the Articles of Agreement. Experience shows that it would more probablystart chiselling away the agreed Articles until the whole Instrument falls to bits,as has in fact occurred in the case of the Irish Treaty.The conclusion reached is that the Government would risk involving itselfboth here and&apos;in India in great trouble if it lent itself to any such project. Whilstthey would satisfy nobody, they would restart the whole controversy in Indiaand in England, they would alarm the Muslims, they would not convince the hindus. The Anglo-Indians, the depressed classes and the scheduled classes,the commercial world and the princes would all be disturbed and disheartened.The olive branch would bear only apples of discord. I submit that it is unwise to estimate the situation as being merely a question of the clearing away of&quot; misunderstandings.&quot; There are no misunderstandings. There is a profounddifference, not between the British Government and India, but between the BritishGovernment and Congress. The British Government has offered the Act of1935 as a great constitutional experiment, and is loyally trying to carry it out.Congress is insisting upon a. totally different solution. To imagine that thisfundamental difference can be bridged by additional qualified promises is. i venture to believe, illusion.The whole of this country is, I believe, united in its determination to bringIndia steadily forward on its road to self-government. There is, however, a courseon which we are already embarked, to which we are committed and which in the short time it has been in operation has, in many parts of India, shown some earlypromise of success. I refer, of course, to provincial self-government under theact of 1935. It is true that the central problem has not yet been &quot;resolved underthe Federal scheme, but impatience in these great affairs is rarely justified andit is always possible that from the Viceroy&apos;s proposals just approved by theCabinet some alternative solution for central Government may gradually evolve.Meanwhile, so soon as Congress chooses to avail itself once more of the immensepowers given for provincial self-government under the Act, the great experiment ofIndian self-government can go on and be faithfully tried out. Surely this is themore prudent path.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.July 17, 1940.
