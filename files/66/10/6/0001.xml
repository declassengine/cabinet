TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 99--0\t is requested that special care may be taken toensure the sec^eoy of this document.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)-SECRET^      -     - -  Copy No:      g dWP (40) 275   -20th July, 1940.WAR   CABINETPROPAGANDA FOR THE FUTUREMemorandum by the Minister of Information.The morale of the people of Great Britain at the present time isexcellent.     Their mood is one of expectancy and confidence.     They areawaiting an invasion and have no doubts as to their ability to repel it,But no moods endure indefinitely, and from the point of view of propagandait is important that we should prepare for what is to come.Either the invasion will take place and &quot;be defeated.or else, itwill be indefinitely postponed.      In either case there will &quot;be a reaction ofopinion and people will begin to ask themselves the question &quot;What next?&quot;It seems highly probable that this phase will be accompanied by peace offersfrom Germany, of which faint indications have already been apparent.      TheGerman case would be that they had accomplished their purpose;    that they wished to introduce a new order into the continent of Europe;    that they had never desired a war with Great Britain, but that Great Britain and france had declared war on them while they were engaged in rectifying the situation of Poland.     Now that they had overcome all their enemies on the continentwhy should the useless struggle continue?     Great Britain could not win thewar except by starving the continent of Europe, which.would be a crime againsthumanity.     Britain, possessing in her colonies and dominions the largestEmpire in the world, should be content to leave Europe alone.      Importantwaterways, the Straits of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal should be internation-nationalised;    the colonial situation in North Africa should be readjusted;    italy should be assured of her rights in the Mediterranean, but otherwise no claims would be made against Great Britain in spite of all the damage she had.done to Germany.     She would be left in possession of her vast empire, herprosperous.commerce and her command of the sea.Such a peace offensive would be more dangerous than any invasion.The object of it would be to give Germany time to consolidate her gains, toreplenish her resources, to strengthen her fleet, with a view to a far moreformidable invasion of Great Britain in the future, launched probably without warning in time of peace.     The danger of such a peace offensive would lie in the fact that it would make a very wide appeal.     To those suffering from war-weariness and lack of vision it would seem eminently fair and reasonable.People would ask themselves for what it was that they were fighting.     Theysurely could not be expected to continue a world war for the sake of Poland.Still less could they be asked to sacrifice themselves for the small neutral countries which had refused to collaborate with us until they were attacked,which had appealed for our help when it was too late, and which had collapsedingloriously.     As for France, after the. treachery of the Petain Governmentvery few English People would be found willing to make sacrifices - on her behalf.The cry would be that we should wash our hands of Europe and concentrate uponthe development of our overseas possessions, which has always been the policyof the Isolationists.
In order-to-be-prepared for this-perilous situation the Governmet :should now formulate in their own minds, with a view to conveying it to thJpeople, a clear and definite picture of the cause that is at stake. Hateias Nazism and Fascism appear to us we must recognise that to millions of y]people in Europe they constitute a faith and an inspiration, rendered tcHjlstill more imposing by the wreaths of victory with which they:are adorned,yThey have also the glamour of revolution, of a hew order, of a &quot;better worllSo long as we are fighting for our own island we need have no fear but that!our cause will stir the emotions of our people just as deeply as this new Iphilosophy stirs the minds of our enemies. But when the island&apos;ceases to Ibe the issue, when the menace to it has been, withdrawn, something else must!be put in its place to stimulate the temper of the nation. If it then be i thought that we are fighting merely to. restore the Europe of Versailles anilthe England of the last two decades, the hearts of the people may begin to Ifail them because their heads will not convince them of the justice of thefjcause.It is perfectly true that Hitler is both Introducing a new order 1and uniting Europe.   He is fashioning the whole- continent on the totalitariipattern, he is moulding it into one entity under Germany&apos;s heel;     He claiathat he is thus preventing the possibility of future European war.      So loJas his successful tyranny endures, his claim holds good, but the answer to!should plainly be that Great Britain is also anxious to see a united Europe!but Europe united by goodwill and in friendship, rot by force and in terrorsa Europe based upon some federal system, details of which, will be worked oufafter the war with the glad co-operation of all the nations, a Europe&apos; innarmaments will be pooled and trade barriers will be. broken down, and in w!each nation will be allowed to conduct its own affairs in its own way withthe same kind of freedom as each state in the American Union possesses.    Iis not necessary here to elaborate the scheme, but it would be the duty ofthose engaged on propaganda to elaborate it.Not only would such a scheme give to the people in this country a cause to fight for, but it would also encourage the resistance and revivehopes of all the people,?- of the vassal nations who. would again have sometfrdefinite to which they could look forward.     No country possesses such goodcredentials as Great Britain for putting forward such&apos;a scheme,  since-we alcan point-to a previous and successful experiment on similar lines.     We cshow how our own free Commonwealth of democratic nations has been createdhow well it has stood the test of two terrible wars.     We can also point tothe facts that we have introduced self-government in India; . we - have aboil&apos;the protectorate in Egypt, preferring to base our relations with that count on a treaty concluded with a freely elected Government;    and we alone aaoagthe nations have,  in Iraq, converted a mandated territory into an independekingdom.The other side of propaganda on these lines should- concern itself with the future at home.     Here again there.should be a policy and a&apos;progrAll evidence goes to show that the greater part of Hitler&apos;s success in&apos; winriover the minds of moderate, middle-aged Germans was due to the manner in wfche solved the problem of unemployment.     He has proved that the - problem isinsoluble, and there is nothing that a Dictator can- do which cannot be betiaccomplished by a Democracy.     Here again it is not. proposed to go into detWe should proclaim that we do intend to make a better world at home in whicthe abuses of the past shall not be allowed to reappear.     Unemployment,education, housing and the abolition of privilege -should form the main piof such a platform.     We must be careful not to slip into the error- of appto be bribing men to fight by the promise of short hours and high wages whe
D.  C.20th July, 1940.it is all over.      We must not promise wealth and ease because that is a promise we could not fulfil.      But we can promise in return for labour andsacrifice a greater equality of opportunity and a more even distribution of wealth.     Here again, although no doubt many chances have been missed, ourcredentials are better than those of any other nation, for nowhere else hasthere been during the last 50 years so much: social reform and so much progress.If the views which I have somewhat vaguely adumbrated above meet with the general approval of the War Cabinet, the Ministry of information would be provided with the guidance that is needed with regard to theprinciples upon which they should plan propaganda for the future.
