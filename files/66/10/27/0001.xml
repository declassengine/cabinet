SECRET. / Copy No.    26W.P. (40) 296.July 31, 1940.TO BE  KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.RELATIONS  WITH  FRANCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN accordance with the War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusion No. 214 (40) of the29th July in regard to the relations with France, General de Gaulle has beenasked whether he would feel that he would be compromised or embarrassedby British representation at Vichy, and, particularly, whether he would beopposed to our making any concession to the French Government in the matterof leaflets.General de Gaulle&apos;s reactions are as follows :  (1) He sees no reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government should not maintaincontact with the Vichy Government. He does not think that suchcontact will produce any positive results at the present stage, buthe feels that it might be of value in helping towards a more favourableevolution of the French Government at a later date.(2) As regards leaflets, General de Gaulle does not think that these are ofvery much use. Propaganda addressed to Frenchmen must, to beeffective, come from French sources. If leaflets are obviously producedin London and are dropped from British aeroplanes they lose a gooddeal of their effect. It would be better if they could appear to be ofFrench origin and be dropped from French aeroplanes. This beingso, the General would have no objection to our undertaking not to droppropaganda leaflets in Morocco.(3) As regards the detention of certain members of the French Missions inLondon, General de Gaulle thought that this was a purely Britishquestion and he had no opinion to express.In these circumstances it would seem that we could safely offer the VichyGovernment the concessions that were considered by the War Cabinet on the29th July and that the draft reply to the French representative, which formedAnnex II to my paper W.P. (40) 288, might be approved. In the last sentenceof paragraph 3 the words &quot; abusive of &quot; should be substituted for &quot; injurious to.&quot;It is important not to give up the right to drop leaflets and the concessionoffered by His Majesty&apos;s Government would be the right to drop pamphletsabusive of the Vichy Government.H.Foreign Office, July 31, 1940.11122   [21572]Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1940.
