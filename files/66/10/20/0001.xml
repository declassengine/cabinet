WAR OABINETo &apos;PAR EASTERN POLICY.Report by the Chiefs of Staff,We are now preparing an Appreciation of the situationin the Par East in the event of possible Japanese aggression,,This appreciation is urgently required as a military backgroundagainst which to view out policy vis-a-vis Japan,,      Both&apos;Australia and New Zealand are anxious to obtain it since it contains the answers to several questions on defence policywhich they have asked usD      Moreover the Government ofAustralia has indicated that it is in the light of thisappreciation that the decision will be taken as to whetherthey can spare an additional division for Malaya,      The earlycompletion of this appreciation is therefore clearly ofurgent importance.In the course of our consideration of the problem,however, a fundamental difference of opinion has arisen on aquestion which has far-reaching political as well -as Militaryrepercussions.20 We are all agreed that, committed as we are in europe and the Middle East, we must do everything short of sacrificingour vital interests to avoid an open clash with JapanD      Wehave already advised, for example, that we should make consider-able concessions to Japan, including the closing of the burma road, as part of a general settlement.      We are also agreedthat in present conditions and with oui&quot;8 existing resources wecannot afford to regard a Japanese occupation of Indo-Chinaor Thailand as a casus belli-,     Any direct Japanese attack on british territory must of course involve us in hostilities butwe are agreed in doubting whether the Japanese themselves arelikely to make such an attack in the near future, since wethink they must be anxious to avoid war with the BritishEmpire if they can gain their ends without ito3. Our divergence of view primarily concerns theNetherlands East Indies0If we could be certain that the D,S,Ao would go to warwith Japan in the event of a Japanese-attack on the netherlands east Indies, we are agreed that we should fight., irrespective of the attitude of the Dutcho    In the absence of American co-operation, we are agreed that if the Dutch do not resist weshould not fight9 since we alone could not prevent a japanese occupation of the Netherlands East Indies0    We are, however, not agreed on the policy we should adopt if, in the absence of american co-operation, the Dutch decide to fighto    On the onehand, the Chief of the Air Staff.the Chief of.the ImperialGeneral Staff and Manor General Ismay, maintain that the mte--grity of these islands is a vital British interest for

the preservation of which we should give the Dutch allthe support and encouragement wo can, provided, they fight,.On the other hand.,  the First Sea Lord, while fullyappreciating the strategical disadvantages of a japanese occupation of the Netherlands East Indies,  feels strongly that in present circumstances we should, on no accountinvolve ourselves in war with Japan as a result of japanese aggression of this area,lj.0 The views of the First Sea Lord may &quot;be summarisedbriefly as follows(a) There is nothing we can do to prevent a japanese occupation of the Netherlands East Indies,We are in no position to offer Military support to the Dutch in the Far Fast and we should not therefore undertake commitments which,  in theevent, we shall he unable to fulfil,(b) A Japanese attack on the Netherlands East Indiesneed, not lead to war between ourselves and Japan.On the contrary,  the Japanese probably wish toavoid war with the British Empire and would hope that we -.?ouL&amp; not regard, such an attack asa casus belli.,(c) Our object is to defeat Germany,    If we become involved in. war with Japan,  our ability to achieve this object will be very seriouslyprejudiced,      In particular our seacormnunica&apos;FLons in&quot; the Indian Ocean and theFar East would be subject to a heavy scale of attacks       War with Japan may,  of course, be forced upon us,  in which case we shall have totake up the challenge, but it would be follyto add Japan to the list of our enemies in circumstances in which there is a good chanceof avoiding doing so,5. On the other hand:,  the remaining members of theCommittee advance the following views:-(a) The Dutch are our Allies,  the Dutch Governmentis in Ld:&apos;4on and. Dutch naval and air forces are engaged with ours in defending British interestsin Home Waters,,    In these circumstances,  itwould be,  to say the least of it, difficult torefuse to assist them in the defence of theirpossessions in Fie East Indies,(b) Failure to take any acti      in the event of japanese aggression in the Netherland.s East Indies wouldhave a deplorable effect upon the Dominions,who would almost certainly conclude that wewere pursuing an Insular policy of payingattention to the security of the United kingdom at the expense of that of the Empire,    the dangers of this impression have already been pointed out by General Smuts, and. the sympathiesof the Union of South Africa are not likely to favour a policy of inaction towards the Dutch0

(c) Australia and New Zealand would see themselvesbecoming virtually isolated from the rest of theEmpire and the former would he most unlikely to agree to send reinforcements to Malaya*She might in fact even withdraw the squadronsshe is now sending to Singapore0(d) If we failed to support the Dutch in the Far East,all chances of obtaining American support in this area would probably disappears(e) The capture, of the Netherlands last Indies would only be a first stop towards  the capture of malaya and the elimination of British interestsin the Par Bast.      Although we might avoid warwith Japan on this issue,  hostilities would, sooner or later be Inevitable,,      Wo should then startat a serious disadvantage in a position which itwould be extremely difficult to retrieve,(f) If the Japanese were to establish themselves in the islands their naval forces would have free access to tee Indian Ocean and would be able to bring a- still heavier scale of attack to bear on ourvl&apos; ii trade      The security of Singapore would, be serious].;&quot; weakened by the establishment ofshore-based air forces within close range of the fortress *  and in the event of war with Japan,Malaya would be cut off from Australia,(g) The Dutch forces in the Netherlands Past Indiesare considerable;, and the prospect of facingcombined. Anglo-Dutch opposition.,  togetherwith the uncertainty of the attitude of theUnited States of America should provide astrong deterrent to Japan0      In view of theinterest which the United States of america as evinced in the status quo of the netherlands east Indies, Japan cannot disregard thepossibility of American intervention against their.,(h) Although the direct military support we could provide at present is small,  we could exerteconomic pressure on the Japanese by the denial of markets and essential imports,,, a plan inWhich the United States of America might wellagree to oo-oporatdc6. In view of the urgency oith which this appreciationis required, not only by Service Departments but byCommanders in the par East and. by the Governments of theDominions, we ask for an early decision as to what our policy is to be if Japan attacks the Netherlands east indies and the Dutch fight.(Signed) CLAN.
