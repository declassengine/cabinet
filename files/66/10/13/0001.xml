, -nnnnMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,Copy No.     . tJz ....WAR       CABINETENEMY&apos; EXPORT control memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.On July 13th, the War Cabinet authorised me (ConclusionsW.M. (ho) 202) to introduce, for the purpose of rationing spain and. Portugal,  a system whereby any ship approaching Europe wouldbe liable to seizure unless covered &quot;by a ship navicert or other form of safe conduct.      The reason for introducing this drastic action (the practical application of which is now being worked out)is that the difficulties of interception at sea are now great andthat the risk of ships being diverted for the purpose of dis-charging contraband cargo is therefore no longer a sufficientdeterrent to discourage their owners from blockade running.2.     Very similar considerations apply to enemy export control.This has hitherto been exercised at contraband bases or by patrolssatisfying themselves that all cargo in an outward bound ship is covered by Consular Certificates of (non-enemy) Origin and interest.     This form of control will still be effective for ships attempting to pass outwards through Gibraltar or Suez.Neutrals will, however, soon discover that it is not effective for ships leaving the Atlantic ports of France, Portugal and spain;    and it therefore seems desirable to increase the penalties for carrying uncertificated cargo outward bound inthe same way as they are to be increased for carrying unnavicertedcargo inward bound.3*     These penalties will be automatically increased to alarge extent if the Cabinet accepts the proposals put forward by the Minister of Shipping and myself in W.P.(G)(hO) 188regarding the control of shipping as an instrument of economic warfare; for, under those proposals,  any shipowner whose shipsails from Europe with uncertificated cargo would thereafter be deprived of facilities under our control for all his ships.Nevertheless, the penalties for evading export control bycarrying uncertificated cargo ought to be the same as the penalties for evading contraband control by carrying unnavicertedcargo - namely, the liability of the ship concerned to seizure. Iam advised that, to justify this, a new Reprisals Order-in-council would be required as the existing ones only contain power toimpound cargo.     It would also be necessary to take power toconfiscate instead of merely impounding enemy cargo, since itijfould not be possible to impose severer penalties on the shipthan are imposed on the cargo.I The Attorney-General, in conjunction with the LegalIise:ps of tlle Ministries most concerned, has considered the.and reached the conclusion that there is no legalobjection to this policy, provided that certificates of originare readily available wherever goods of wholly neutral originor ownership are to be shipped.     This condition is alreadyfulfilled.
5.      1^ therefore, recommend that I should &quot;be authorised//(i) to arrange for the issue of a new Reprisals Order-/ in-Council permitting the seizure and condemnation; of goods of enemy origin or ownership, and of any ship carrying them, from Europe.Iand   (ii) to include in the announcement to be made shortlyon the subject of compulsory navicerts a statement i that the carriage of uncertificated cargo outward\       bound from Europe will similarly render the ship\^a.nd cargo concerned liable to seizure.H.
