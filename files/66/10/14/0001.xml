THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,,!,-....:        Printed-for the. War Cabinet.   July&apos; 1940.SECRET. Gopy NoJuly 24, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.. 12INDIA.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated July 22, 1940,.giving Viceroy&apos;s Draft of Proposed Statement.1473-S. Private and Personal. India&apos;s anxiety at this moment of critical importance in the world struggle against tyranny and aggression, to contribute to the full to the common cause and to the triumph of our common ideals, ismanifest. She has already made a mighty contribution. She is anxious to makea greater contribution still. His Majesty&apos;s Government are, deeply concerned that that unity of national purpose in India which would enable her to do soshould be achieved at as early a moment as possible. They feel,that some further statement of their intentions may help to promote that unity. In that hope theyhave authorised me to make the present statement. ,.2. Last October, His Majesty&apos;s Government again made it clear that dominion Status was their objective for India. They added that they were ready to authorise the expansion of the Governor-General&apos;s Council to include a certain number of representatives of the political parties, and they proposed the establishment of a consultative committee. In order to facilitate harmoniousco-operation, it was obvious that some measure of agreement ,in the Provincesbetween the major parties was a desirable pre-requisite to their, joint collabora-tion at the Centre. Such agreement was unfortunately not reaphed, and in thecircumstances no progress was then possible. s.3. During the earlier part of this year I continued my efforts.to bringpolitical parties together. In these last few weeks I gladly entered into conversa-tions with prominent political personages in British India and the Chancellorof the Chamber of Princes, the results of which have been reported to HisMajesty&apos;s Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government have seen also the resolution passed by the Congress Working Committee, the Moslem League and HinduMahasabha.4. It is clear that earlier differences which had prevented,the achievement of National unity remain unbridged. Deeply as His Majesty&apos;s Government regretthis, they do not feel that they should any longer, because of those differences,postpone the expansion of the Governor-General&apos;s Council, and establishment ofa body which will more closely associate Indian public opinion with the conductof the war by the Central Government. They have authorised,-me accordingly to invite a certain number&apos;of representative Indians to join my Executive Council.I hey have authorised me further to establish, a War. Advisory council which would meet at regular intervals and which would contain; representativesoi Indian States and. of other interests in the national life,of India as a whole.5. The conversations which have taken place, and resolutions of bodies which I have just mentioned, made it clear, however, that there is still in certain quarters doubt as to the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government for theConstitutional future of India, and that there is doubt, too, as to whether theposition of minorities, whether political or religious, is sufficiently safeguarded[21554],
in relation to any future Constitutional change, by assurances already given.There are three main points that have emerged. On those three points HisMajesty&apos;s Government now desire me to make their position clear.6. The first is as to the position of minorities in relation to any future constitutional scheme. It has already been made clear that my declaration oflast October does not exclude examination of any part of either of the Act of 1935or of the policy and plans on which it is based. His Majesty&apos;s Governments(concern that full weight should be given to views of minorities in any revisionhas also been brought out. That remains the position of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.It goes without saying that they could not contemplate transfer of theirpresent responsibilities for peace and welfare of India to any system ofGovernment whose authority is directly denied by large and powerful elements in India&apos;s national life. Nor could they be parties to coercion of such elementsinto submission to such a Government.7. The second point of general interest is machinery for building new constitutional scheme when the time comes. There has been very stronginsistence that framing of that scheme, subject to provision for certain matters,should be responsibility of Indians themselves. His Majesty&apos;s government recognise the natural desire of India to frame her own Constitution. There are\of course, certain matters for which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot divestthemselves of responsibility obligations arising out of their long connectionwith India, the position of the States, the arrangements to be made for defence until such time as India is herself able to meet unaided her needs inthat field, matters such as external affairs, the Indian debt, questions connectedwith services and with the protection of commercial interests.His Majesty&apos;s Government have seen in various quarters the suggestion thatsuch matters might suitably form subject of discussion and agreement separately from discussions on main framework of the new Indian Constitution, and thatthat framework, subject to that reservation, should be left to Indians themselvesto devise. His Majesty&apos;s Government now authorise me to say that they are quite prepared to agree to such arrangement, and to accept as body to frame, on theconclusion of the war, the main structure of the Constitution, any body on whichthe representatives of the principal elements in India&apos;s national life can mean-time themselves agree. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel confident, too, that anyagreed proposals &quot;put forward by such a body for ratification by Parliament would carry immense authority and that it might be assumed that Parliament would consider them in the most friendly spirit and with the utmost anxiety to approvethem as they stood.8. The third point is the date by which Dominion Status is to be achieved.His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto refrained from specifying any&apos; precisedate for the achievement of Dominion Status. They have done so becauseof the obvious difficulty of indicating a precise date for reaching a point whichcan only be reached after much preliminary discussion between Indian intereststhemselves and between Indian interests and His Majesty&apos;s Government.But it is clear that, however unjustly, their reluctance to fix a date ismisinterpreted. 0 They authorise me now to say that they would regard withentire satisfaction the achievement of such progress as would make practicablethe constitution&apos;Of the new Dominion of India within twelve months of cessation of hostilities. It is clear that the moment when the Commonwealth is engaged in astruggle for existence is not one at which Constitutional issues can be debatedand thrashed out. But they would most readily set up immediately on theconclusion of the war whatever body the representatives of the principalelements in India&apos;s national life can agree on to devise the framework of thenew Constitution, and they would lend all aid in their power to expedite decisions on all relevant patters to the utmost degree. In the meanwhile, and for theperiod of the war,[ it is their hope and trust that, with Central Governmentreconstituted arid strengthened in the manner I have described, and with the help of the War Advisory Council, India will be able, with co-operation of all parties, communities and interests, to play the part she desires in the conductof the war and to prepare herself for the tasks of full and free national life thatlies before her. :!.
