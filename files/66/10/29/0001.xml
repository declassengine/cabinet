NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.THERE has been increased U-boat activity and heavier losses of merchant ships have resulted. An enemy raider has been sighted and engaged off the east coast of South America.Home Waters.2. About 1630 on the 25th July, British aircraft on patrol sighted nine orten enemy E-boats near Cape Gris Nez which were proceeding to attack thewestbound Coastal Convoy, then approaching Dungeness and already beingrepeatedly attacked by enemy aircraft. H.M. Destroyers Brilliant and Boreasand two British M.T.Bs. were sent to intercept and engage the enemy. Onsighting our destroyers the enemy retired under cover of a smoke screen. Theywere engaged for 15 minutes, but with unknown results. The destroyers came under the fire of enemy shore batteries, and were also twice heavily attacked bydive-bombers while withdrawing. The Boreas was damaged in both bombing attacks, and had 15 killed and 29 wounded, 16 seriously. The Brilliant receiveda direct hit on the quarter deck in the second attack, but had no casualties. Bothships were towed by tugs back to Dover.At 0230 on the 26th, four ships which had left the above convoy for Shorehamwere attacked by an E-boat.  Three ships were sunk and one made port safely.3. As a result of these losses to the westbound Channel Convoy, these convoys are in future to run as combined naval and air operations, the numberof vessels for each convoy being limited to twenty-five. A Mobile Balloon Barrageis to be provided with each convoy.4. Dover harbour was bombed at 1230 on the 25th, but no damage orcasualties were caused.   Portland was also attacked.5. An outward-bound convoy for Sierra Leone was attacked on the after-noon of the 26th July by a U-boat, three ships being sunk.6. Nine Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm attacked shipping in the Bergen areaearly on the 26th and claim to have sunk an enemy M.V. of 3,000 tons. TwoSkuas collided during this attack, one crashing instantly and the other on landing.7. The first M-T.B. anti-invasion patrol off the Maas and the Scheldt wascarried out on the night of the 26th without incident, and again on the nights of the 29th and 31st.8. On the 26th at 0545, H.M.S. Naiad, proceeding from Rosyth to Scapaafter doing her trials, was bombed, but not hit, off the Moray Firth. H.M.Destroyer WHITSHED was bombed 19 miles east of Yarmouth and was undamaged.9. Dover harbour was twice attacked on the 27th, and HM. DestroyerWalfole was damaged by a near miss and her speed was reduced to 10 knots.H.M. Destroyer Codrington was sunk during the second attack by a direct hit,and H.M. Destroyer Depot Ship Sandhurst had her engines, boiler room andbunkers flooded by damage caused by the same bomb. There were only threeslight casualties in the Codrington and none in the Sandhurst.10. On the same day H.M. Destroyer Wren, whilst affording AA. protec-tion to minesweepers off Aldeburgh, was bombed and sunk, and HM. DestroyerMontrose, in company with the Wren, was damaged and was towed to Harwich.The Montrose shot down two enemy aircraft. Four officers and 99 ratings fromthe Wren were saved.11. Also on the 27th, H.M. Salvage Vessel Tedworth was bombed andslightly damaged off North Foreland and had some casualties; a convoy wasunsuccessfully bombed off the Humber; and the S.S. Westavon, in another convoy,was disabled by a near miss about 40 miles off Orfordness.12. On the 27th there were indications that the enemy naval units in norway were active, and a strong force of capital ships, cruisers and destroyers,escorted by aircraft, swept up the Norwegian Coast, but no enemy ships were met.
13.   H.M.S. Norfolk reported on the 28th that an explosion, possibly of a torpedo, took place in her vicinity.14.   On the 28th, the Western Patrol off the French and Spanish Coasts was instituted to complete the blockade of Western Europe.15. H.M. Armed Trawler S taunt on was mined and sunk with all hands offHarwich on the 28th.16. H.M. Destroyer Delight was attacked p.m. on the 29th off PortlandBill by 16 aircraft, but received no direct hit, although her W/T was put outof action by near misses, a fire was started in forward oil fuel tank, and bothboiler rooms were put out of action. About three hours afterwards a heavyexplosion occurred forward, and at 0053 on the 30th it was reported that the-ship was on fire fore and aft, but it was possible that the after part was still&quot;afloat. Amongst the 147 landed there were one killed and 33 seriously wounded.17. H.M. M/S Trawler Brock was unsuccessfully attacked by three or four aircraft in the afternoon of the 29th, and H.M. Sloop Hastings and convoy were attacked about 1715 on the 29th by about fifty aircraft, 22 miles off Harwich.Our fighters broke up the attack, however, and the convoy received no damage.Two ships were mined off Harwich during the 29th, both in the northboundconvoy, one being sunk.18. H.M. A/ S Trawler Dane-man was attacked by E-boats soon aftermidnight of ,28th-29th, 22 miles south-west of Beachy Head. The enemy, afterfiring torpedoes at the Danemdn which missed, retired to the westward.19. Dover was again attacked at 0725 on the 29th by a large number of bombers, several of which were, shot down. H.M. Armed Yacht Gulzar andS.S. Grondland were sunk, and H.M.S. Sandhurst received further slight damage.20. H.M. Destroyer Valoroms and convoy were attacked off the Naze early on the afternoon of the 30th, but fighters intercepted and no damage to the convoyoccurred.21. H.M. Minelaying Submarine Narwhal which left the Humber on the22nd July to lay mines off the coast of Norway, is overdue and must now be presumed lost.22. H.M. Destroyer WHITSHED, while patrolling off Harwich, struck a mineat about 0500 on the 31st, but succeeded in reaching Harwich under her ownpower, stern first. She incurred the following casualties : 5 killed, 15 wounded and 8 missing.23. A new Eire M.T.B. was bombed but not damaged off Portland at 1130on the 30th.24. H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Mooltan was twice attacked by aircraftwhen 70 miles west of Land&apos;s End on the 31st. Some damage was caused by near misses and slight casualties reported; she is proceeding to her base for repairs.25. The 6th Canadian Troop Convoy, escorted by a strong naval force, has arrived safely in the United Kingdom.Mediterranean.26.;, During the period under review light forces escorted a convoy from alexandria; to the ^gean and returned with a convoy for Alexandria. Thenorth-bound convoy was shadowedi by aircraft but no attack resulted. The south-pound convoy was,heavily bombed throughout the 29th. Heavy forces operatedto the south of Crete to cover these operations, and on the 27th July were attacked by aircraft which dropped over 60 bombs without inflicting any damage otherthan two minor casualties in H.M.A.S. Sydney.27. On the 28th July, H.M.S. Neptune captured a Small Greek ship, theHermione, carrying. 300 tons of petrol, and; 200 ton,s of lubricating oil for the dodecanese, but later had to sink the ship off the Gulf of Athens on account of a heavy air attack. The crew were left in their boats close to the land and statedtiiat they required no assistance.[21587] b
28. The Fleet was bombed during the afternoon of the 29th. H.M.S.Liver-pool was hit by a bomb which did not explode, and had one killed and twentywounded.Two fighters from ELM. Aircraft Carrier Eagle encountered three italian aircraft and shot down one and probably damaged a second.29. On the 24th and 27th July, light forces demonstrated off CasteloritzaIsland (to the east of Rhodes), but failed to produce any enemy action.30. Malta and Alexandria have been attacked by air on several occasionswithout damage resulting, except that on the 25th July a small empty ammunitionship was hit at Alexandria.Other Foreign Stations.31. At 2230 on the 28th July, H.M. Armed Merchant CruiserA leantara reported that she had chased an enemy raider about 600 miles east ofRio de Janeiro, and that she had been in action for an hour. The enemy openedfire at 16,000 yards with great accuracy, and her second salvo severed theAlcantara&apos;s fire control circuit and wireless aerial. The accuracy of the enemy&apos;sfire deteriorated after she had been hit, and at 9,200 yards, the closest range atwhich the action was fought, she turned away behind smoke floats and escapedto the southward at 15 knots, the Alcantara&apos;s speed having been reduced to10 knots by a hit in the engine room. The Alcantara&apos;s armament remains intact.It was impossible to estimate the damage to the enemy, but it is believed that herspeed was reduced. The Alcantara arrived at Rio de Janeiro on the 31st. naval forces are searching for the raider.32. The Dutch Cruiser Sumatra in the West Indies is on passage fromKingston, Jamaica, to Curacao, where she will refuel.33. The Polish s.s. Kroman arrived at Freetown on the 30th July, havingbroken out of Dakar on the 27th. The captain confirmed that the French battle-ship Richelieu was hit by two torpedoes, in addition to the damage to her sternduring the attack on the 28th July.34. The s.s. Orduna, which landed the French Mission at Lisbon, has leftLisbon for Liverpool p.m. on the 31st, after an hour&apos;s delay caused by suspectedsabotage.35. The Governor of the French Cameroons has forbidden the entry of any british merchant ship and has demanded the prompt departure of H.M.S. Dragon.British shipping is being instructed not to enter French Colonial ports in theSouth Atlantic. It is considered that evacuation of British subjects from FrenchCameroons will probably be necessary.The Governor-General of Madagascar is showing a changed attitude and isnow hostile to Great Britain.36. A submarine is reported to have been sighted on the surface at 1130on the 25th off Tortola Island (West Indies). The United States of Americastate that they have no submarines in those waters.Anti-Submarine Operations.37. There were nine attacks on enemy submarines in Home Waters duringthe week, one of them by aircraft.The attacks by H.M.S. Clarkia on the 26th and by H.M.S. Walker and h.M.S. Periwinkle on the 31st, and by H.M. A/S Trawler Loman on the 28th, alloff the North Irish Coast, are considered promising.38. H.M. Submarine Sealion made an unsuccessful attack on a 250-tonUdooat with guns and torpedoes off the Norwegian Coast on the 29th.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.39.   Convoys on the East Coast and in the Channel have again been attacked persistently during the week, as reported in the &quot;Home Waterssection, above.
40. The activity of U-boats has increased during the period under review.They have been working further afield and one has been reported as far south as the Cape Verde Islands. There is no real evidence yet that they are makingregular use of advanced bases in Western France.41. Eight British ships of 61,666 tons and two Greek ships of 7,662 tons were sunk by U-boats a total of 69,328 tons.Five British ships of 20,467 tons and two Norwegian ships of 2,261 tons, atotal of 22,725 tons, were sunk by mines.Three British ships of 2.480 tons were sunk by E-boats, and six British ships of 6.672 tons and one Danish of 1,264 tons were sunk by aircraft attack. thus a total of 22 British ships of 91,285 tons and five ships of other nations, 11,187tons, a grand total of 102,472 tons, were sunk by enemy action during the week.This is a considerable increase on previous weeks.Full details of ships sunk and damaged are given in Appendix I.Convoys.42 1,001 ships, including 145 Allied and 41 neutral, were convoyed duringthe week, of which five ships were lost by attack by U-boats, five by aircraft andtwo on mines a total of twelve ships.Fourteen armed merchant cruisers, 26 destroyers, 16 sloops and 13 corvetteswere employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the27th July totalled 741,560 tons, compared with 808,688 tons during the previousweek. There was an unusually large importation of oil of all grades, 23 tankershaving brought 242,761 tons. Mineral imports amounted to 143,078 tons, ofwhich 118,144 tons were steel, iron ore and scrap iron. Cereal imports were102,762 tons and other food imports 64,008. Of this, 20,522 tons wererefrigerated and tinned meat, 27,215 tons were sugar and 400 tons were rum.Enemy Intelligence.German.43. Of the main units of the German Fleet, on the 28th July air reconnaissance indicates the battleship Tirpitz is at Wilhelmshaven completing,and the battleship Bismarck at Hamburg in the same state; an 8-inch cruiser isalso completing at Bremen. The Scharnhorst is at Kiel damaged, also one 8-inch cruiser possibly damaged; the Koln possibly repairing and the lutzow damaged and in dry dock. On the 28th July, Trondheim was reported clear of enemywarships. It has been reported that the Gneisenau has been seen in the Kattegat,and, although this is without confirmation as yet, it is considered possible thatshe may have returned to Germany.Italian.44. There has been very little evidence of activity on the part of Italianmain units in the period under review, and there has been an almost completewireless silence. On the 26th July a cruiser of the Bande Neri type was reportednear Tripoli, and again on the 31st July a ship of the same type was sighted by aircraft at 1645, 85 miles south-east of Malta. At Tobruk an air reconnaissanceon the 24th July showed the old cruiser San Giorgio, three merchant ships andone submarine. A further reconnaissance on the 30th July showed six merchant ships there and two submarines alongside the submarine jetty.45. A story deriving from various sources states that either the Conte diCavour or the Giulio Cesare was recently bombed in mistake for H.M.S. Hood.Details were added of mutinous sailors and attacks by sailors on airmen. the accounts are varied and a little confused and lack any real confirmation, but, inview of the report of H.M.S. Warspite&apos;s aircraft that the Italians bombed theirown ships in the course of the action of the 9th July, cannot be entirelydisregarded.[21587] B 2
, Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.46. It has been reported from Vigo that a German tanker is alongside the oil wharf discharging petrol. The cargo, estimated at 7 million litres, is said tohave been bought, by. Spanish monopoly.The Enter (1.879 tons) sailed1 from Musel, near Gijon, on the 28th Julyreaching Biord on the 30th. ;&quot;The Rhakotis (6,753 tons), which is at Antofagasta, Chile, is likely to beattached by the Asiatic Petroleum Company on account of debts. Her crew issaid to be dissatisfied owing to lack of money! The, Frankf-art (5,522 tons), atTalcahuano, is reported to be loading 500 tons of coal from a Chilean ship.The1.&apos;Weser&apos;(9,179&apos; tons), which left Costa Rica on the 11th&apos; July, arrived atManzanillo on the 23rd. She and the Havelland (6,334 tons), which sailed fromthat port on the .27th June, are said to have been given arms and supplies at seaby Japanese ships.The Arauca (4,354 tons), at Port Everglades, Florida, is endeavouring tcclear the fine against her legal attachment.On the 18th July an American ship sighted a suspicious-looking loadedtanker. This may have been the Winnetou (5,113 tons), which has not beenreported since she sailed from the Canary Islands on the 9th April., Italian.47.   The Fulgor (6,504 tons) sailed from Huelva for Cadiz on the 29th July.It was reported last week that Italian merchant ships were likely to sailto Japan under Japanese colours. Later, Japanese officers were seen on board.Two ships, the Enderia (2,278 tons) and the Amba Alagi (3,710 tons), leftWoosung, near Shanghai, on the 25th and 26th July respectively for Wuhu. Itis reported that they will there load ore before sailing for Japan.The Mbngioia (6,113 tons) has proceeded from Galveston Roads to Houston,where she is expected to discharge.The Conte Biancamano (23,255 tons), which is at Colon, has on board atleast 2,000 tons of copper. On the 24th July she bad not been able to obtain permission to unload for transhipment.The Gerusalemme (8,052 tons), at Lourenco Marques, has completed thedisembarkation of her passengers and the discharging of her cargo and declaredthe voyage at an end.British Minelaying.48. On the 27th July, ELM. Ships Esk, Icarus, Intrepid and. 1mpulskelaid 130 moored magnetic mines in the southern extension of the East coast barrier, and on the same day .H.M. Ships&apos;&apos; Southern.&quot;-Prince- Port Napier,Port Quebec and Menestheus laid .548 antenna mines and &apos; 1,536 moored mines to the south of St.: George&apos;s Channel. : On1 the1 30th July !H:M.S. Ploverand the Dutch Van der Zaan laid 170 antenna mines &quot;in tile: East coast barrier. Minelaying by aircraft has continued, chiefly by Bomber Command.In all, 30 magnetic and 13 non-magnetic mines were laid. According to theSwedish Press a German minesweeper exploded Sound.   This maybe the first indication of successful magnetic sweeping on the part of the enemy.Enemy Minelaying British Minesweeping.49. , During the week the 24th to 31st, July, magnetic mines have been laidnightly off our East,. South and. West Coasts in spite of, the shortening of themoonlight, hours.50. Following a severe attack on our minesweepers in the Harwich area,a contact minefield was laid, probably by E-boats., in the East Coast War Channelto the. east of,Harwich. Thirteen mines Kave sbeen&quot; swept or cut, apart from thefour casualties, and. all were, within a length of 15 miles pi the&apos;channel. u0neof these mines was towed into Harwich&apos;and rendered safe.&apos;.,From thisispecimenit appears that the inines&apos;are&quot;pf&quot;a&apos; new:tyjpe/^lmilar&apos;&apos;to,.but&quot;&quot;smaller&apos;&apos;tnaii-theGerman&apos;X type. Four fleet sweepers, three paddle sweepers&apos;and six trawlersare operating to clear this field.
51. The magnetic mine total is now 512 and the contact mine total 448.Seventy-four magnetic mines were exploded during the week, the LL sweepexploding 61 of these.52. Newhaven was reopened to traffic on the 28th July, having been closedsince the 4th.   The port will be closed nightly from dark to 7 a.m.53. The mine exploded in the River Tay on the 28th was exploded byMauve sweep. The Oropesa trawlers Gadfly and Sturton were hauling the Mauvesweep when the mine exploded, damaging both trawlers.54, Charts recovered froin ah enemy machine brought down in Devon onthe 27th had areas marked on them which are thought to indicate proposed mine-laying areas.55. :When enemy aircraft attacked minesweepers off Harwich, the Oropesatrawler Fleming was sunk with a loss of 19 of her crew. &apos; The trawler Berberis inthis action destroyed one enemy plane and severely damaged another. The LLtrawler Rod inn was sunk by enemy aircraft off Dover on&apos; the 24th. FourteenOerlikeh&quot; guns are being transferred from the Home Fleet to;ithe Nore Commandto strengthen the anti-aircraft arihament of small minesweepers. *:56. The use of the Magnet sweep, which at the beginning of the war wasthe only antidote to magnetic mines, has now been given up at the majority ofminesweeping bases.57. Evidence collected over the last few weeks points to the laying by theGermans of a mine barrage between the north edge of their early declared area and a position about 135 miles to the north-westward. A dangerous area hasbeen declared.Allied Naval Forces.Dutch.58. The Cruiser Sumatra at present at the disposal of C.-in-C. Americaand: West Indies is shortly to proceed to Sourabaya for an extensive refit: Foursubmarines are at work with the 7th and 9th British Flotillas. Of the remainingsubmarines, one is at the A/S School at Rothesay, one is on her way to the UnitedKingdom from Curacoa, and another is refitting at that port. One submarineis completing at Portsmouth. Seven M/S Trawlers are ready and at work and twelve more are fitted out. --H M   1 ,   ;   :        x .Norwegian.59. One of the Norwegian M.T.B.&apos;s has been in action with enemy divebombing aircraft and brought down one of the enemy. This has caused great satisfaction in Norwegian circles.MILITARY SITUATION.Middle East.Libya.60. Although the concentration of Italian troops in eastern Libya has been further strengthened by units moved eastward from Tripplitania and there hasbeen an increase of stores and ammunition dumps south-west of Bafdia, no information has yet been received of an actual advance1 from Cirenaica towardsEgypt. :;-!- ;61. An Italian communique, published on the 25th July, gave the number of italian casualties in Libya from the outbreak of hostilities up to the 15th Julyas 55.Egypt.62. Two of our armoured car patrols operating in the Western Desert were attacked by Italian fighter and bomber aircraft on the 28th July and failed toreturn; m *ns$ v bsJS?.J vc; irmUmbd jvxao H &apos;(% H6U zdi :. o axv.:. i        J?&apos;v
East Africa.63. The Italian forces have advanced 30 miles South from Moyale as far asDobel.   Our forces concentrated at Buna now consist of four battalions.The Balkan States.64. In the Dobruja, apart from the frontier guards, all Roumanian troops have been withdrawn behind the line Turtucaia-Bazargic-Balcic and there are indications that a further withdrawal to the line of the old Dobruja frontier.Silistra-Mangalia, may be contemplated.65. Further details are now available regarding the withdrawal fromBessarabia. The withdrawal was very poorly carried out and many units neverreceived any orders. The Minister for National Defence and the Minister ofthe Interior have, therefore, visited Army Headquarters to investigate. Theresult of this visit has been that about 75 officers have been court-martialled forcowardice and inefficiency. Though the Roumanian morale was at first severelyshaken, the general impression created by the state of the Russian troops isreported to have had a restorative effect and to have engendered a confidence inthe ability of the Roumanian Army to hold its own. Moreover, there is now sometalk of preventing by force the transfer of Transylvania to Hungary.AIR SITUATION.General Review.66. Our bombing policy remains generally unchanged, and operations were maintained against the German Air Force and industrial and shipping objectives,in spite of the continuation of adverse weather, particularly at night. our fighters met with considerable success, but otherwise there is little of outstandinginterest to report.67. The scale of German bomber operations fluctuated at the beginningof the week, but rose to about 100 aircraft on the 28th duly, and remained at this level for the rest of the week. Operations are described in the following Section.Short-range dive-bombers are increasingly employed, and the Me. 109 hasappeared as a bomber. Formations have again shown a tendency not to develop their attacks in the presence of fighters, but have suffered heavy casualties duringthe week.68. There was no change in the general employment of German bomber-reconnaissance aircraft which were very active, and the routine weather flightscovering the North Sea and Western Approaches, including Southern Eire, wereregularly carried out. Standing patrols of heavy fighters over the Low countries were again identified on several nights, and Me. 109s have also been encounteredat night in this area. Much use is still being made of transport aircraft forcarrying supplies to Northern and North-Western France. This shows thatground communications may still be inadequate for the supply of aerodromes inthese areas.69. Both British and Italian air operations in the Middle East and mediterranean have maintained their normal character.70. Seventy-eight German aircraft were destroyed during the week, with afurther twenty-eight unconfirmed, bringing the total of confirmed losses up to2,990. Italian losses were twelve confirmed and five unconfirmed, making theconfirmed total 133.   53 British aircraft were lost during the week.Great Britain.71. Enemy bombing policy has followed the same lines as during theprevious week, and operations were on approximately the same scale. daylight attacks have not been systematically carried out except against shipping and ports,the principal effort being against Dover Harbour and convoys in the vicinity.72. At noon on the 25th July enemy bombers protected by fighters launcheda large-scale operation against Dover.   Waves of as many as fifty aircraft
continued to attack for seven and a half hours. Severe damage was prevented by our fighters who successfully intercepted and inflicted casualties of twenty-one aircraft confirmed, with a further twelve probable. Seven of our fighters werej0st. Three additional enemy casualties are claimed from anti-aircraft fire. Onthe 27th July, bombs were dropped by ten Messerschmitt 109 in a surprise attack and dock equipment was damaged. This is the first occasion on which this singleseater fighter is known to have operated as a bomber. On the 28th July,approximately 100 aircraft were engaged by our fighters off Dover, resulting inseven enemy aircraft being shot down, with the loss of two Spitfires. On the29th July, Dover was again heavily bombed by a formation of forty bombersescorted by forty fighters, but comparatively slight damage was caused and our fighters accounted for fifteen of the enemy confirmed, with a further two uncon-firmed; two enemy bombers were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. Our losses were again two fighters. Raids on our shipping were also attempted off the Southand East coasts.73. Though the enemy&apos;s principal effort was against shipping,reconnaissances and meteorological flights continued throughout the week. Nightraiding, apart from minelaying, continues to be somewhat aimless, though aconsiderable number of aircraft have been engaged on some nights during theweek. The bombs dropped have done little or no damage to military objectives.Minelaying has been very widespread, at West Coast as well as East Coast ports.There has been also a certain amount of inland bombing, of which details aregiven in the Home Security Section of this Resume.74. Fighter Command flew 4,606 sorties during the week and destroyed60 enemy aircraft confirmed, and 22 unconfirmed. Twenty-seven British fighters were lost.Germany and German-occupied Territory.75. Bomber Command flew 116 day and 341 night sorties during the week.Weather was again far from ideal for daylight operations, but there was morecloud cover than during the previous week, and, in consequence, a larger numberof aircraft have reached their objectives. Attacks were carried out on theTirfitz, at Wilhelmshaven, various industrial targets in Germany and aerodromes in France and Holland. Some attacks met with considerable success, but in most cases results were difficult to observe.76. Bombing on a heavy scale was carried out by 178 aircraft on the night of the 25th/26th July, but night operations during the remainder of the weekwere on a lighter scale owing to weather conditions, which hampered identifi-cation of primary targets and rendered results difficult to observe; both heavy and medium bombers took part. Attacks were made on aerodromes, aircraft stores,airframe factories, oil plants, dockyards, barges and railway junctions, inaddition to the dropping of propaganda leaflets over France.77. Severe damage appears to have been caused to oil targets atDortmund, Castrop-Rauxel and Monheim; many large explosions are reported from the airframe factory at Gotha, and aircraft stores at Eschwege. Hits were registered on dispersed aircraft, on a number of aerodromes in German-occupied territory and in the Dortmund-Ems Canal area. Coastal Command aircraftsuccessfully attacked oil and fuel targets at Cherbourg and Amsterdam and direct hits were observed on barge-building yards at Spaarndam. Marsten light-house, off the Norwegian coast, was put out of action on the 26th July.North Sea and Coastal.78. Extensive photographic and other reconnaissances, anti-invasion and anti-submarine patrols and convoy escorts have been continued by coastal command. Movements of enemy warships have been reported and armed patrolsnave attacked E-boats and merchant shipping, direct hits being secured on three merchant ships. There does not appear to have been much submarineactivity and only one anti-submarine attack was made. Minelaying was continued by aircraft of both Bomber and Coastal Commands in Baltic and Kiel areas.
79. On the night of the 31st July/1st August a Sunderland carried out afourteen-hour reconnaissance of Narvik and, on three separate occasionsSunderlands of the Australian Air Force made three attacks on enemy aircraft which were bombing British shipping. Coastal Command flew 584 sortiesduring the week.Middle East and Mediterranean.Malta.     . .   -80. On the 27th and 28th July, a series of six raids resulted in an interruption to the electric power supply and in. some damage to civilian property in the Grand Harbour area. One enemy Fighter was brought down by anti-aircraft fire. On the 29th and 31st July, enemy aircraft approached the Islandbut retired without dropping bombs. On the 28th July, in the course ofreconnaissances by our; Sunderlands, two enemy fighters were shot down. Onthe 31st July, one enemy fighter was shot down and a Gladiator lost, but the pilot was saved.Egypt.   &apos; * ...   . .. (J. ,,!:.81. On the 26th July, reconnaissance of Derna confirmed the presence offorty enemy aircraft in addition to six damaged by our raid on the previous day.Blenheims subsequently attacked the landing ground and four^possibly five-^-enemy.aircraft were hit. On the 27th July, the enemy raided Alexandria but no damage was: done. During reconnaissances on the 28th July, enemy casualties were three, and one of our Blenheims is reported missing.Sudan, Aden and British Somaliland.82. On the 25th July, our aircraft, operating from the Sudan, demolishedseveral buildings at Massawa. Our attacks from Aden set hangars on fire atMacaaca on the 31st July, and attacked aircraft on the ground at Raheita on the26th and 27th July. On the 27th Blenheims bombed and machine-gunned aircraft on the ground at Mille, setting fire to one and damaging others. There was only slight enemy activity during the week. Enemy aircraft attacked Zeilah, inSomaliland. on the 25th and fuel tanks at Aden on the 29th, without success.On the 28th July, one ship in the Outer Harbour at Aden was hit.German Air Intelligence.83. Extracts from recent Raid Assessment Reports are contained inAppendixItalian Air Intelligence.84. Rome. On the night of the 24th July an air raid alarm was given bythe authorities at get a and was passed on to Rome. All .the Rome A.A. batterieswent into action against imaginary Royal Air Foi&apos;ce aircraft, and the resultingbarrage caused a good deal of damage to buildings through flying shrapnel. Twopeople were killed and four wounded.85. German aircraft. Information has been received that 100 german aircraft, including dive bombers and Messerschmitt fighters, have been sent toItaly from Graz. A further report from a reliable source states that 38 Ju.87have already been despatched to Libya via Klagenfurt and- Italy. although there is no further confirmation of the arrival of these aircraft, it is of interestto note that Italian pilots have been trained recently at Graz in dive-bombingtactics on the Ju.87.U.S.A.86. Aircraft Production. Mr. TP. Wright, who is the Chief EngineeringOfficer of Curtiss-Wright and a member of the National Defence AdvisoryCommittee, has made a detailed study of aircraft production in the United Statesand abroad. In a recent article on the implications of thepresent &quot; 50,000; planesa year &quot; programme, he gives the following estimate of potential production in
I Ci JLTurkey.88.   Turkey has applied for twenty Royal Air Force flying instructors.89. The Turkish General Staff report that frequent reconnaissance flightshave recently been carried out by Italian aircraft over South-West Anatolia, and state that they have on that account restricted their own flying in that area.There is no information indicating that diplomatic protests have been lodged, noris there reason for, which has moved the Turks have restricted their own flying inthe area known. It is presumed that the Italian aircraft carrying out thesereconnaissances are based on the Dodecanese, and that they avoid such centres as are known to be defended by AA. artillery.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General Review.90. Enemy air activity over the land has been on a reduced scale and has been confined to flights over coastal areas, with scattered bombing, most of which hasbeen ineffective. Besides major attacks on Dover Harbour already referred to,there have been minor attacks on docks and industrial establishments, and a fewbombs have been dropped on or in the vicinity of aerodromes and railway com-munications; most of the.bombs have fallen harmlessly in.rural areas without anyapparent objective. There has, however, been a noticeable increase of activity in the neighbourhood of London.91. Bombs have been dropped mainly in the South and South-West, on theEast Coast and in South Wales in daylight and, in darkness, in East Anglia,including the Southern and Eastern outskirts of London, in South-East England,South Wales and the Firth of Forth.92. The only considerable damage clone inland was to Boulton and Paul&apos;sworks at Norwich, in a raid by a single aircraft on the 30th July. This factory(not an aircraft factory) is now closed. Fifteen high-explosive bombs were dropped, of which eight fell in built-up areas and private property consequentlyalso suffered. Some damage was done to shops and gas and water mains at Hullearlier in the week. Attacks were made in the vicinity of aircraft factoriesnear Weybridge and Glasgow. There was machine-gunning from enemy aircraft at Richmond Park and Balham during the night of the 30th/31st July.Casualties.93. Fifteen people were killed and fifty-four injured during the week, tenbeing killed and sixteen injured at Norwich.[21587] -       cthe United States. It is estimated that an aeroplane production rate ofapproximately 2,000 a month or 24,000 a year can be achieved in two and a half years, or by January 1943. Rate of production of 3,000 planes a month or 36,000a year can be obtained m four years, or by Spring 1944, and a rate of just over4,000 planes a month, or 50,000 planes a year, in five years, or by July 1945.French Possessions.87. In view of the fact that the morale of French forces in North Africa isbelieved in general to have undergone a steady deterioration in the past fewweeks, some interest attaches to the report of French sergeant pilot, recentlyevacuated from Casablanca. According to this informant, French aircraft arebeing flown from Casablanca to outlying districts in order to avoid contact withthe German and Italian armistice commissions, a majority of the pilotsmaintaining their wish to transfer themselves to British control and to continueto fight actively against the Germans. It is also stated by the same source thatthere are now two Bomber groups (34 aircraft) at Dakar
Civil Defence Services.94. The Civil Defence Services have carried out their duties promptly andsatisfactorily. Experience shows the importance of the closest liaison being maintained between A.R.P. services in industrial establishments and the civil defence organisation of the district in which they are situated. Ina few cases there is evidence that air raid casualties have been hurried to hospital without the preliminary treatment necessary to protect them against the movements involved.Warnings.95. South Wales and the Bristol Channel Coasts, and Southern coastal areasof England have been under red warning on a number of occasions. There havebeen a few red warnings on the North-East Coast, and in Eastern Scotland. Thepurple warning was introduced on the night of the 25th/26th July, and at different times has been in force in South-West England, the Bristol Channelcoasts, South Wales, East Anglia, and in London, South and Central.Morale,96. With few exceptions, the behaviour of the public remains excellentunder the strain of air raids. After the first experience people seem to developconfidence and co-operation. Some loss of morale, however, resulted from theNorwich raid, Boulton and Paul&apos;s factory having been bombed before on the9th July.
