TO BE KEPT UNDER LOOK AND KEY.It is requested thut special case iviay be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment._;_z_SECRET. GOpy No.  AO\ 7W.P.   (40)  299. &apos;    V3rd August,  1940.WAR    CABINET.SITUATION IN THE FRENCH COLONIES IN WEST AFRICA.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for theColonies.1.      The War Cabinet will recollect that on the 7th July*they gave me authority to pursue a policy of a friendlycollaboration with the established authorities in the FrenchCameroons.2.     Monsieur Brunot, the Governor General, accordingto reports received from the Governor of Nigeria, had shownhimself most- forthcoming to our friendly approaches and had declared that he was prepared,  if the issue was forced, to&quot;break off his relations with the Vichy Government and continue the fight as our ally.     We informed him that he^would have our support in pursuing this policy, and made itclear that if he declared for us, the necessary financialassistance to enable his administration to continue would be forthcoming.3.      For some time the situation developed favourably,but it took a sudden and less propitious turn on the arrival of Admiral Platon, an emissary of the Vichy Government, whowas evidently dispatched to call Monsieur Brunot to order.The means of pressure which the Vichy Government have to bringupon the French administrations abroad are obvious, and theywere no doubt exercised by the Admiral from Vichy.      since this visitation Monsieur Brunot&apos;s attitude has shown amarked change, and the latest development is that he hasvirtually withdrawn from his relations with the Governor of nigeria and has refused to receive representatives sent bythe Governor.4.     Monsieur Brunot has, however, not receiveduniversal support from his compatriots in the territory,where there has always been a very definite basis of anti-Vichy feeling.      I have now received a report from theGovernor of Nigeria that,  in view of Monsieur Brunot&apos;sdefection, a movement has been formed in support of general de Gaulle, and that Monsieur Mauclere, the Director ofPublic Works, has been unanimously.elected to lead it.A copy of the Governor&apos;s telegram is attached as Annex A tothis paper.      Monsieur Mauclere has asked for acategorical statement whether His Majesty&apos;s Government will support him if he seizes power at an opportune moment,whether they are prepared to assist him in seizing powerand whether they would guarantee his security and that ofhis followers if their coup d&apos;etat were to fail.*   W,M.(40)  196th Conclusions, Minute 2.

5.      It clearly seems desirable, both from the point ofview of the situation in Africa and in view of ourrelations with General de.Gaulle,  that we should give allthe encouragement we can to Monsieur Mauclere&apos;s movement.We should therefore undertake to accord him recognition ifhe were successful in establishing an adminIstratioh, and weshould offer to extend to that administration the financialand economic assistance which had been promised toMonsieur Brunot, &quot;but was suspended owing to the latter&apos;schange of attitude.      The Governor recommends, however,that our encouragement of Monsieur Mauclere should not go tothe extent of openly assisting him in an attempted coupdVetat against the established authorities in the Caineroons.The General Officer Commanding, West Africa, supports thisview on the grounds that the necessary military forces arenot available.      It seems probable, moreover,   that aspontaneous movement would have a greater impression on the surrounding French territories than one which owed its success to our open intervention.6. At the same time, it seems necessary for us to guarantee to receive Monsieur Mauclere and his followersinto Nigeria if their movement fails.7.    I will add a word on the general West Africanbackground.      Our first aim on the collapse of France was to induce the French Colonies to fight on as our Allies.      V/eestablished close contact with the local Frenchadministrations and offered stibstantial financial inducements.The reaction leaves no doubt that there are French elementsready to rally to our side.      But the Vichy Government is ina position to exercise strong pressure on the local officials who have been in a defeatist and wavering frame of mind:and there is no doubt that the official policy of the localadministrators is new one of obedience to Vichy and refusal to co-operate with us.Lines of policy in the face of this situation seemto be four:-(1)    Economic pressure .We are laying our plans for this and the prospects are promising.      But it is a policy for the long term.(2)    Propaganda.We are making efforts to improve our wirelesspropaganda and to work up other forms,  such as leaflets,whispering campaign, etc.(3)   A direct show of force.Various possibilities are being considered hutmilitary advice hitherto has ruled this out.(4)    To foster and build up such dissident elements inthe French territories as show themselves disposed to reject the official French policy.S0      My particular proposal here is that we should.   apply

apply &quot;the policy in (4)  to the overtures which we havereceived from Monsieur Mauclere.      I accordingly attach thedraft of a telegram (Annex E) to the Governor&quot;of Nigeriagiving him instructions to  return an encouraging reply toMonsieur Mauclere.      This telegram is in accordance with therecommendation of the Vansittart Committee to whom the matterlias &quot;been referred and I am asking the approval of the WarCabinet for its despatch.     Owing to the precautions taken bythe Brunot Administration there may be some difficulty in getting this reply through to Monsieur Mauclere:    hut&apos;this weshall make every effort to overcome.L.olonial Office.3rd Augus t,  1940 .

ANNEX A.Telegram from Governor of NIGERIA-Dated 30 th July.       \ Received 8,54 p.m. on 30th July, 1940.Most Immediate.Addressed to ijecretary of state No. 862 repeated to\fest Africa Governors Repeated to Consul General Leopold villeL/353.    Governor Sierra Leone please inform 0. in 0. south atlantic.I have received the foilowin.. from Dual a.   Begins.Movement ferried here yesterday Sunday In support ofGeneral De Gaulle.    Mauclere. Director of public V/orkswas unanimously elected Head.    Already comprises sixtyprominent men and is growing rapidly.    Mauclere requestscategorical statement whether His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill support him if he seizes power at an opportune moment in the name of De Gaulle&apos;s Government, and if soto what extent.    Are we prepared to assist him inseizing power or to guarantee    his security and that ofhis followers if coup d&apos;etai fails?   meanwhile in view ofthe possible disorders arising from this movementconsider it advisable that His Majesty&apos;s ShipDragon should return to the vicinity preferably VictoriaEnds oClifford consider movement of importance andassured of success if it has.support from the army which atany rate in Duala is likely.    He considers that a successfulPutsch would be heartily welcomed by planting community inGamercona and would bring Ubang Sharfrid over to our side atonce.    On information before me I think this view is probablycorrect.2.      Our attitude must I presume depend to some extent on the prospect of improvement in relations with Vichy.    Apartfrom this idea of successful Putsch in Camcroons has itsattractions, but question of extent and the nature of support which we should accord is very delicate.    If we refuse supportwe run risk of alienating friends to whom we have givenconsiderable encouragement, and of missing the opportunity ofestablishing in the Cameroons an administration which is ready for full co-operation.    If our support is too active and tooobvious we run serious risk of alienating both Boisson andHusson, and latest port Lamy reports indicate that there isstill reasonable chance of improvement in relations with bothof thesec    Also we may involve in undesirable military commitment (including Naval action),3..      Much as I dislike advocating a continuation oftemporizing policy which circumstances have so far forced uponuss i believe answer to Mauclere should be as follows.Considerations

Considerations of high policy renders it impossible for us togive active and overt assistance to an attempt to overthrowBrunot&apos; s Government.    On the other hand we should welcome theestablishment in Caraeroons of an authority that will fullyco-operate with us both in maintaining integrity and prosperity of Cameroons as a whole and in continuing the struggle againstGermany and Italy.    If such an administration can beestablished by purely French efforts we believe rest of FrenchAfrica would be Vattracted, whereas if it were obvious that effect had been instigated and actively aided by us reactionselsewhere might be not only less favourable but even activelyunfavourable.    If they themselves can establish such an administration by their own efforts we will gladly recogniseit and maintain close relations with it and give that fulleconomic co-operation which we had not only promised but hadtaken actual measures to establish.    That co-operation we are definitely not prepared to give to Brunot in his presentframe of mind.4.      As regards a guarantee of security if a coup d&apos;etatis attempted and fails, I suggest we should say that we will do our best for them, and, if they come over to Nigeria willlook after them unt..l they get in touch with De Gaulle and receive his instructions.    Ve should also send warship toDuala to protect British interests.    Clifford is sure that hewill be asked whether we would render military assistance if,after coup d&apos;etat,  they are attacked by French troops from elsewhere.    I fear answer must be in the negative.5.      R.1UB DRAGON should certainly not go to Duala tcsupport Putsch, but, if C in C. agrees, I see considerable advantage in a visit to Victoria.&apos;6.      I am asking Consul General Leopol dville to commenturgently to Foreign Office as possible reactions of Hussonare of considerable importance.7.     Giffard is at ;0nugu but returns this evening,    as there are.possible military implications I will telegraph his views or get him to do so as early as possible.

ANNEX B.Draft telegram to the Governor of Nigeria.MOST IMMEDIATE.SECRET.Addressed to Nigeria No. .     Repeated to Gold CoastNo. . Sierra Leone No. (Please inform Commander in chief South Atlantic).      Gambia No. .      Consul-General Leopoldville No.Your telegrams Nos.862 and 876.      I consider thatin our own interests we cannot afford not to give to thisspontaneous de Gaulle movement in the Cameroons the strongest encouragement that circumstances permit.     On theother hand I agree with views of yourself and GeneralOfficer Commanding in his telegram G/3874 of 31st July toWar Office that it is impossible for us to give activeassistance to Mauclere in bringing about coup d&apos;etatApart from military objections, there are the reasons which you cite, namely (a) risk of alienating both Boisson andHusson and (b) fact that our open support would depriveMauclere&apos;s movements  if successful,  of a good deal of itsforce as a factor likely to stimulate other Frenchprovinces to follow suit.2.     But if we are to support Mauclere at all, weshould not leave him with the impression that we were onlyhalfhearted.      I consider therefore that reply proposed inyour paragraphs 3 and 4 should be revised on the following lines.     Begins.     We should warmly welcome theestablishment in Cameroons of an authority that will fullyco-operate with us both in maintaining integrity and prosperity of Cameroons as a whole and in continuing thestruggle against Germany and Italy.      The fact of such an administration being established by purely French effortswould, we believe, have a powerful effect on the rest ofFrench Africa.     For this reason we consider it undesirable for us to give active and overt assistance to an attempt tooverthrow Brunot&apos;s Government, since in that eventreactions elsewhere might be not only less favourable but even actively unfavourable.      But if Mauclere and his associates establish a firm and effective administration bytheir own efforts, we will gladly recognise it, maintainclose relations with it, and accord to it the full economic co-operation and financial assistance which had been offered to Brunot but which,  in his present frame of mind,we are definitely not prepared to give to him.     Ends.3. Remainder of reply, regarding guarantee of security if coup d&apos;etat fails, could then follow asproposed in your paragraph 4.4.      In view of G.O.C&apos;s.  telegram referred to above, i fear

fear there is no alternative to our informing Mauclere,  ifasked, that we could not render military assistance to himif, after his coup d&apos;etat     he was attacked by French troops from elsewhere.     We should presumably defer recognition ofMauclere until it was fairly ,certain that he was in assuredcontrol of the territory, and would hope that result, farfrom provoking French attack from outside, would be to stimulate similar de Gaulle movements elsewhere, e.g. inChad.     But do you consider that if reply on this pointwere given as proposed it would have effect of discouragingMauclere from making the attempt?5.     Admiralty agree to make H.M.S.  &quot;Dragon&quot; availableto go to Victoria when required.6.     For your own information,  we are taking steps topublicise, both through medium of local merchants and in french short wave broadcasts from London, the fact that existing Cameroons administration is by its present attitudejeopardising the economic welfare of the territory for aconsiderable period.      It is being pointed out that rivertraffic on the Benue will only be possible for a very short time longer, and that if British boats on the river do not enter French territory in the very near future (which,depends on the attitude of the local French authorities),the produce of the affected areas will not be lifted formany months to corner    nor will supplies be able to enterthese territories by the river route.      Furthermore, unlessthe stocks of cocoa and other produce now filling all available storage in Duala are cleared almost at once, thenew cocoa crop will rot for want of storage,  and, otherproduce cannot be moved.7.     The intention is of course by these means to influence planters and trading coramtuiity in the Cameroons infavour of an administration willing to co-operatepolitically with us, and thus to provide a favourablebackground for Mauclere&apos;s movement.      If you think itadvantageous, I see no objection to your passing substance of the above on to Mauclere in strict confidence in order toshow him that, while our attitude in refusing overtassistance to his movement may seem somewhat lukewarm, weare in fact doing our best to give him a favourable wind.
