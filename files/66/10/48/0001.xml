(40) 633)August 16, 1940TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy oi this document war cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 50)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon August 8th to12 noon August 15th,1940[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.ENEMY air attacks on the channel ports have increased in intensity. Therehave been minor engagements of patrol craft off the Dutch Coast. Four enemyraiders are believed to be at sea in the Atlantic, Pacific or Indian Oceans.Home Waters.2. During the week a cruiser force has been operating east of Iceland to meetpossible German activity emanating from the Norwegian Coast and to interceptGerman raiders which it was believed might be returning from the Atlantic. Onthe 10th August H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Transylvania was torpedoed ormined 45 miles north-east of the Bloody Foreland and sank four hours later.Forty-six officers and 205 ratings w-ere rescued by H.M. Ships which went to her assistance, and, of these, six ratings were wounded. Five officers and 31 ratingsare missing. On the night of the 12th/13th August three M.T.B.S encounteredenemy patrols 15 miles west of the Hook of Holland and engaged with Lewisguns and bombs. M.T.B.18 was slightly damaged by ramming an enemy drifterwhich she mistook for an E-boat. There were no casualties in our ships. Duringthe night of the 13th/14th August H.M. destroyers Malcolm and Verity engagedsix enemy trawlers and three E-boats off the Texel and believe that they sank onetrawler and one E-boat before the enemy were lost behind a smoke screen. Therewere no casualties or damage to our ships. H.M. Submarine Sealion on return from patrol reported that she torpedoed the Norw-norwegian s.s. Toran (3,318 tons)southbound off the Norwegian Coast on the 3rd August.3. An analysis of the movements of H.M. Ships during the present stage ofthe war shows that on any average day nearly 600 ships are employed at sea,at home and abroad, on routine duties. The various classes are roughly asfollows : 2 battleships or battle cruisers, one aircraft carrier, 35 cruisers and armed merchant cruisers, 67 destroyers, 21 submarines, 151 patrol craft and280 minesweeping craft.4. Enemy E-boats were reported in the Channel on several occasions duringthe week, and on the night of the 14th/15th they unsuccessfully attacked a smallwestbound convoy off Portland.Enemy air activity has steadily increased and attacks have been made onPortsmouth, Portland, Dover and Plymouth during the period, but no majordamage has been sustained.H.M. Destroyers Scimitar and Skate suffered slight damage at Portland onthe 11th August and H.M. Destroyer Windsor Avas damaged in the thames estuary on the same day.H.M. Trawlers Edwardian and Peter Carey were also damaged off the thames Estuary on the 11th August, the former so seriously that she had to bebeached and had three killed and three wounded. She shot down one aircraft for certain and possibly two. On the 12th August H.M. Trawlers Tamarisk andPyrope were sunk by bombs in the same area, in each ship 6 men were killed ormissing, the Pyrope having 1 wounded and the Tamarisk three. On the13th August H.M. Trawler Elizabeth Angela was sunk in the Downs by a directbomb hit, the casualties being 1 missing and 6 wounded. On the 14th Augustbombers attacked and sank the Folkestone Gate Light Vessel. Two of the crew of seven were killed and five wounded.Other Foreign Stations.5. Sweeps carried out by our light forces in the Eastern Mediterranean havenot resulted in any encounters with enemy vessels.On the morning of the 13th August H.M. Ships Auckland and Kimberleybombarded and dispersed troops and lorries at El Sheikh about 40 miles west ofBerbera and on the same day H.M.S. Carlisle hit an enemy aircraft attackingBerbera, the pilot of which was subsequently captured.6. Malta was attacked seven times on the night of the 12th-13th August,but our fighters kept the enemy at a great height and no damage resulted.
Shortly before midnight on the 13th August nine British aircraft of theFleet Air Arm from Malta, three armed with torpedoes and six with bombs,attacked a concentration of shipping in Augusta harbour. The results of thetorpedo fire were not observed, but possibly some bomb hits were made on a group of small vessels. All three torpedo aircraft were lost, but the crew of onewere saved. Reconnaissances on the 14th showed a large merchant ship very low in the water and close inshore.It is reported that during the air raid on Derna on the 3rd August onecruiser and one destroyer were damaged and are being sent to Taranto or Speziafor repairs.7. The small Greek minelaying cruiser Belle was torpedoed and sunk onthe 15th August whilst at anchor off the Island of Tinos (iEgean Sea). It wouldappear that she was attacked by an Italian submarine.It is reported that on the 8th August the S.S. Shinwa was pirated by Chinesesoldiers who boarded the ship from a steamer flying the J&quot;apanese flag. There is evidence of Japanese negligence in this piracy.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. Five attacks by surface craft and three by aircraft have been made onsupposedly submarine targets, but no visible results were obtained, and in oneor two instances it appears more likely that the target was a wreck.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. During the period 30,000 tons of shipping has been sunk by enemy action;of this total, 3 British ships (22,502 tons) and one neutral (5,779 tons) were sunk by submarine, one British ship (1,537 tons) was mined and one neutral (929 tons)was sunk by air attack. In addition, five ships (18,762 tons) have been damaged by air attacks.There were air attacks on convoys on the 11th August off the East Coast and during the night of the 13th/14th August off Kinnaird Head, when convoys were attacked by the light of flares, but in none of these was any ship damaged. Onthe 10th August the S.S. Warwick Castle was unsuccessfully attacked by aircraftnorth-west of Ireland. This is the first instance of air attack in this area. Onthis day an outway convoy off Anglesea was also attacked.Details of sinkings and damage are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. A total of 1,104 ships, including 155 Allied and 59 Neutral, were convoyed during the week ending the 11th August, and of these, six vessels were lost due to enemy action. One battleship, two cruisers, ten armed merchant cruisers, 31 destroyers and 36 sloops and corvettes have been employed on escortduty. Since the start of the war 31,981 ships have been convoyed and&quot; only 80 havebeen lost.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the10th August were 894,515 tons compared with 1,161,638 tons during the previousweek. Seventeen tankers brought 204,756 tons of oil. Mineral imports were177,632 tons, of which 136,526 tons were steel, scrap iron and iron ore. cereal imports totalled 216,051 tons, an increase of 26,573 tons. Other food imports were 99,200 tons, of which 36,700 tons were refrigerated and tinned meat, 14,732tons were fresh, dried and tinned fruits and 8,125 tons were sugar. Wine importstotalled 1,207 tons, and an unspecified quantity was also brought by the City ofBremen, 902 tons from Oporto. 609 tons were from Cadiz, 193 tons from Lisbonand 405 tons from Australia.[21639]b
Enemy Intelligence.German Main Units.11. The main source of information in the current period is an air reconnaissance over Kiel on the 12th August. It appears that the majority of thelarger German ships are still in clock except that the cruiser Koln has left theport. This gives the following list of ships unaccounted for and presumablyserviceable : Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin.Pocket Battleship Admiral Scheer.One 8-inch Cruiser.Leipzig.,       Number g.Koln.The cruiser Emden is believed to be repairing.German Submarines.12. The main concentration of German submarines in the period underreview has been in the North-Western Approaches, where as many as six mayhave been present on the 8th August. This number declined during the week to two or even one, but there were signs on the 14th August of the arrival ofthree more.One of the two submarines working in Western Approaches may have gone into Lorient during the week.There may be a submarine near the Azores or even farther south, but therehas been no news of her since the 12th August.German Surface Raiders.13. In an appreciation of the position as to enemy surface raiders maderecently, it is suggested that there are now at least four at sea, of which one leftGermany early in April and the others early in June. The April raider appearsto have proceeded southward in the Atlantic and into the Southern Pacific by the cape of Good Hope. This ship is believed to have laid the mines discovered offAuckland (New Zealand) in the middle of June, and to have shelled theCity of Bagdad on the 11th July in the Indian Ocean. A second raider was atwork off the West Indies in mid-July, and though this may have been the shipengaged by H.M.S. Alcantara on the 28th July, it is thought more likely that theA Icantara came upon one of the other two raiders whose existence it is necessaryto assume in view of the positions of certain sinkings in the South Atlantic whichare inconsistent with the known activities of the first two raiders and cannot bethe work of one ship only.The first raider is believed to have been responsible for the destruction orcapture of seven ships including one sunk by mine, the others for possibly nineships, of which one, the Dutch Kertosona, has since reached Brest with a prizecrew on board.Italy.14. On the 7th August three cruisers and five destroyers were observed by aircraft 25 miles W.N.W. of Benghazi and one cruiser and three destroyers inthe port itself. Air reconnaissance over the Sicilian ports on the 12th Augustshowed considerable concentrations of merchant ships in Augusta and Syracuse,but only one destroyer and some flying boats.It is now considered highly probable that the story of the damage to theItalian battleships Cavour and Giulio Cesare at the hands of their own airmen istrue. The story has been confirmed from good sources, but the extent of the damage is not known.Enemy Merchant Shipping.Germany:15. The tanker Nordmeer, 5,646 tons, which left Vigo on the 1st August,arrived at San Sebastian from Santander on the 5th August. The Euler, 1,379tons, left Bilbao for Bayonne on the 12th August.
A broadcast from Moscow on the 12th August states that Stockholm badreported that regular steamship service would be resumed at the end of August,by&quot;German ships belonging to a Hamburg Steamship Company, between Holland,Belgium and Sweden.The Fulda, 7,744 tons, which was recently chartered by a Japanese firm, andthe Bremerhaven, 1,615 tons, are reported to have &quot; disappeared &quot; from Dairen.The Este, 7,915 tons, which was seized by the Dutch at Curacao, is reportedto be about to leave for England, where she will dispose of her cargo. The ship is said to be in a very foul condition.The tanker Eurofeld, 5,863 tons, at Teneriffe, is reported to have taken in ,000 tons of gas oil and 1,000 tons of fuel oil.It has been reported that the Goslar, 6,040 tons, which was scuttled atParamaribo, can easily be salved.The Chilean Government has authorised the British firm of Duncan Fox to deliver 700 tons of Diesel oil to the Rhakotis, 6,753 tons, which is at Antofagasta.This supply of fuel to a German ship by a British firm has been approved by us for special reasons.Italy.16. The Limano, 1,592 tons, which was seized at Gibraltar on the 11th June,arrived in Londonderry on the 12th August with a general cargo. While in convoy H.G. 40 she was machine-gunned by a German aircraft 40 miles west of Donegal.   She will be renamed the Empire Resistance.The Caterina Gerolimich, which has been at Dublin since Italy declared war,has requested Marconi&apos;s to repair her W/T installation, which is defective.The Calabria, 9,515 tons, which was seized at Calcutta on the 11th June,is due to arrive at Vizagapatam on the 19th August.The Pietro Campanella, 6,140 tons, and the Mar Glauco, 4,690 tons, bothleft Norfolk, Virginia, on the 8th August for Baltimore and Philadelphiarespectively.The tanker Alabama, 6,725 tons, which was scuttled off Maracaibo on the10th June, was refloated on the 11th August and will probably be towed intoLas Piedras shortly.Enemy Losses., 17. Since the start of the war a total of 249 enemy merchant ships of1,212,000 tons have been sunk, captured, seized or destroyed. Of this total,923,000 tons were German, 259,000 Italian and 30,000 tons neutral under enemy control.British Minelaying.18. On the 9th and 11th August H.M. Ships Express, Esk, Icarus, Intrepidand Impulsive laid 100 moored magnetic mines and 30 contact mines on each dayas a reinforcement of the Dover Barrage. On the 12th August H.M.S. Ploverand the Dutch ;Willem van den Zaan laid 170 mines in the East Coast Barrier,and on the same day H.M.Ships Southern Prince, Port Napier, Port Quebec andMenestheus laid 2,094 mines at the north end of the Barrier. Minelaying by aircraft was continued by Bomber Command in the Western Baltic and by coastal command off the North Sea coast of Germany.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweepihg.19. During the period mines have been laid from the East Coast of Scotlandsouthabout round our coasts and up the West Coast to the Clyde. Belfast hasalso been mined. Though most of the mines have been dropped off the harbourentrances and in the approaches, they have also been dropped in the searchedchannels where the depth of water is suitable.A total of 33 magnetic mines have been destroyed, most of them by the LLSweep, the greatest number of mines at any one place being 7 off Falmouth.Enemy bombing raids during the week have caused serious losses to mine-sweeping vessels.   Two Oropesa trawlers have been sunk;  one has had to be
beached, but may be salvable, and one has been damaged. One LL trawler hasalso been sunk. These casualties all occurred in the Tongue-Downs area. Inview of the persistent air attacks on mine-sweeping vessels, it is proposed to carryout sweeping operations by night wherever possible and to stop routine sweepingbetween the Tongue and Beachy Head and off Portsmouth. Searching sweepswill be arranged before the passage of convoys or as required in connection withoperations.The first success during night sweeping operations occurred on the night ofthe 13th/14th August, when a LL sweep exploded a mine in the Barrow Deep.A floating mine has been sunk by one of H.M. Ships north of Berbera, british somali land.U.S.S.R.New Construction.20. There have been indications for some time past that the Italian-designed&quot; Gordi &quot; class destroyers of 1,600 tons have not proved satisfactory, owing totheir very light construction, which does not stand up to weather and iceconditions in the Baltic. Certain of the later vessels, although of the samedimensions, are believed to have been considerably strengthened, probably while on the stocks.Black Sea.Four Russian monitors and M.L.&apos;s are now stationed on the Bessarabianbank of the Danube.Pacific.It is announced in the Press that further large-scale manoeuvres are about tobe carried out in the Pacific.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.21. A report has been received that troops were embarked along the coast of Northern Norway on the 11th August, but this has not been confirmed.Information during the period points to the continuance of preparations forinvasion. It is probable, however, that Germany will not finally decide uponinvasion until the results of the present air attacks upon the United kingdom have been appreciated.Distribution of German Divisions.22. It is reported that certain armoured and motorised divisions have been withdrawn for rest from France and Belgium to Germany, their places beingtaken by infantry divisions. Apart from this no change is believed to have takenplace.Area.	Cav.	Armd.*	Mot.	Inf.	Total.Norway    ...       ...       ...       ...       ... Denmar.: ...       ...       ...       ...       ...

The Balkan States.Roumania.23. The redistribution of the army continues and on the 9th August it was disposed as follows : In  Transylvania:  eleven infantry divisions, one cavalry division,  onemechanised brigade, three mountain brigades.East of the Carpathians : twelve infantry divisions, one cavalry divisionone mountain brigade.In the Dobruja : five divisions, of which one is probably a cavalry divisionSouth of the Transylvanian Alps : four infantry divisions.Bulgaria.24. The Bulgarian Army now consists of 13 infantry divisions, 3 mobiledivisions and 1 mountain brigade. Of this force, 7 infantry divisions and 1mobile division are still concentrated in south-eastern Bulgaria.Greece.25., Reports indicate that preparations for the defence of the northern frontier are being actively pursued. On the Bulgarian frontier it is reported thatthe Metaxas Line is being extended, and that defences are being constructed to theeast of Kavalla and north of Porto Lago. Arrangements have been made for thedestruction of bridges on the Alexandroupolis-Pythion railway.British Somaliland.26.   Italian offensive action has now continued for twelve days.On the 9th August the enemy main column forced the withdrawal of ouroutposts to the main Tug Argan position.27. On the 11th August black shirt battalions made an attack on this position, but failed to penetrate it except at one point on the left flank. the attack was supported by heavy machine gun and artillery fire, and was preceded by low-flying attack by nine enemy aircraft. The strength of the enemy forces is estimated at eight battalions, 2 groups pack artillery, at least three medium and approximately 24 light tanks; also one group of irregular troops.28. On the 12th August heavy infantry attacks, supported by tanks, wererenewed. Severe fighting took place during the morning and the enemy was forced to withdraw in two places where a penetration had been effected. at mid-day the enemy attacks were intensified and we were later compelled to evacuate an important point with the loss of two 3-7-inch howitzers.29. On the 15th August, the enemy renewed their attack in great strength,and succeeded in breaking through. It now appears impossible to restore theposition.AIR SITUATION.General Review.30. The recent activities of the German Air Force suggest the openingphase of an attempt to gain air superiority by a process of exhausting our fighterdefences. This policy is not proving successful, and the German Air Force have suffered heavy casualties. On the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th August approxi-mately 50 per cent, of the total German strength of dive-bombers and fighters[21639] c
was probably employed, together with about 15 per cent, of the long-range bomber force. It is believed that the German Air Force is not yet in a position to beginand maintain a sustained full-scale attack against this country.31. The daylight operations have been mainly concentrated in the southernportion of Great Britain, principal objectives being shipping, ports, aerodromes,R.A.F. W/T Stations, and aircraft industry. Damage was inconsiderable in proportion to the effort expended. This challenge has been vigorously acceptedby our fighter pilots, who have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, out of all proportion to those suffered by our own forces.32. Our bombers have carried out their tasks with considerable success,although weather conditions have not generally been favourable. The primaryobjectives have been mainly oil refineries and installations, aluminium works,airframe factories and railway targets. An outstanding event of the week wasthe successful raid on industrial targets in Northern Italy by thirty-two Whitleys,all of which returned safely, except one which force-landed in the sea off Lympne,the crew being saved.33. Minelaying aircraft continue to operate regularly, and during the past week they have been identified along most of the east coast of England and scotland, along the south-west coast of England, in the Bristol Channel and liverpool Bay.34. A new development is the employment of/4-engined aircraft (F.W. 200)for reconnaissance of shipping in the Western Approaches and off the north-westcoast of Scotland almost as far as Iceland.Great Britain.35. Perhaps as a result of the heavy casualties they sustained on the8th August the enemy&apos;s activity on the two following days was on a much reduced scale. Several raids sighted in mid-Channel turned away when our fightersapproached. Me.l09&apos;s carried out unsuccessful machine-gun attacks against theDover balloons during the afternoon of the 0th August, and a He.lll, whichbombed Sunderland, was shot down. On the day of the 11th August the enemyagain displayed considerable activity in his attacks on this country, which have continued unabated, except on the 14th August, probably on account of weather conditions. His greatest activity occurred on the 13th August on a scale far inexcess of anything hitherto carried out over this country, the total number of aircraft taking part being probably between 800 and 1,000. During the periodsubsequent to the 11th August, heavy attacks have been made on Portland,Weymouth Bay and Portsmouth, and on convoys off East Angiia and the thames estuary.   Dover barrage balloons have also been repeatedly attacked.36. On the 12th August a number of attacks were made on B.A.F. stationsDamage was caused to the R.A.F. wireless installations at Pevensey and Dunkirk,near Whitstable, and at a number of aerodromes, particularly Manston, Hawkingeand Lympne. During this day 61 enemy aircraft were destroyed with a further39 probably destroyed, while 39 were seriously damaged. Two-thirds of these werefighters. On the following day a number of aerodromes avere attacked, damagebeing caused at Detling, Andover, Eastchurch and Benson. At Detling8 Blenheims were destroyed and some casualties inflicted. At night the Nuffieldaeroplane factory near Birmingham was attacked by 10 Heinkel aircraft and some damage was caused. On this day our fighters destroyed 75 enemy aircraft witha further 33 probably destroyed and 47 seriously damaged, against our losses of 15 fighters, from which 10 of the pilots were saved. About noon on the14th August large raids approached the Kent coast, and Dover and Folkestonewere dive-bombed, and an attack was made on Manston aerodrome where twohangars were badly damaged. The Bofors guns at the aerodrome shot doAvn twoMe. 110. Later on the same day a number of R.A.F. stations were attacked. some damage was caused at Middle Wallop, Colerne, Hullavington and Sealand(Flintshire).
37. Up to noon 15th August enemy attacks continued and the R.A.F. fighterpilots maintained the ascendancy they had established. Hawkinge and Lympneaerodromes were heavily attacked.38. Throughout the week the enemy has carried out widespread night raidscovering large areas of the country and minelaying aircraft have been active roundour coasts.Fighter Command flew 1,096 patrols, involving 4,475 sorties.Germany and German-occupied Territory.39. Bomber Command flew 161 day and 493 night sorties during the week.Harassing attacks by cloud-flying Blenheims on enemy-occupied aerodromes were carried out on each day during the week. Aerodromes were bombed on twenty-four occasions, on some of which hits were observed on hangars and on aircraft onthe ground, with resultant fires and explosions. Our casualties were sixteen,eleven of which occurred as a result of an attack on Aalborg aerodrome on the 13thAugust. Reconnaissance aircraft reported seeing 50 to 60 aircraft at Guernseyduring the early part of the week, as a result of which the aerodrome was attacked with some success.40. Night operations were carried out with greater intensity than duringthe previous week. Although weather conditions prevented our bombers fromlocating their primary targets on a number of occasions and observing their resultson others, some very encouraging results were secured. On the night of the 8th/9th August a tremendous explosion followed an attack on the Blohm and Vossshipyard at Hamburg, and at the marshalling yard at Hamm there were largerfires and explosions than usual.On the following night an aluminium works at Cologne was ablaze asa result of air attack by fourteen Wellingtons, and chemical works atLudwigshafen was left burning freely after Whitleys had bombed it with overten tons of explosives. Although weather conditions were not favourable, heavy bombers had a very successful night on the 10th/11th August. Their targetsincluded the, dockyard at Hamburg, the naval base at Wilhelmshaven, the oil plant at Frankfurt /Main and a power station at Cologne. On subsequent nights very successful attacks were launched on oil plants at Castrup Rauxel, Wanne Eickei,Gelsenkirchen and Dortmund, on aluminium works at Grevenbroich, and onairframe factories at Dessau and Bernburg. A renewed attack was made on theDortmund-Ems Canal Aqueducts by eight Hampdens on the night of the 12th/13th August, when bombs were dropped from heights varying from 8.000 to150 feet, with, it is believed, good results. On this occasion anti-aircraft fire wasaKusually intense.41. On the night of the 13th/14th August operations by thirty-two Whitleysagainst industrial targets in the Lombardy Plain was an outstanding success,notwithstanding the navigational difficulties inherent in a long night flight ofthis nature. The Fiat factory at Turin offers an admirable bombing target, and bygood chance a parachute flare fell on the roof of the factory buildings and provedof considerable assistance. The bombs falling on the target resulted in fires and heavy explosions. Attacks on the Caproni airframe factory at Milan were followed by numerous explosions, and so extensive were the fires that they remained visible to our aircraft as they crossed the Alps on their return flight.42. One of the most successful attacks during the week was made on oil installations in Western France. The targets were at Blaye, Ambes and Pouillac.It is thought that the latter must be completely destroyed.43. Numerous enemy-occupied aerodromes have also been bombed by ournight bombers, as have military targets in forest areas in North-West Germany.Minelaying was carried out on a number of occasions.
44. Coastal Command aircraft have carried out successful night raids on oil tanks at Cherbourg and the naval base at Den Helder.North Sea and Coastal.45. During the week Coastal Command supplied escorts to 180 convoys andflew 490 other sorties, covering the usual reconnaissance and searches, and anti-invasion and anti-submarine patrols. Extensive photographic reconnaissancesfrom Norway to the west coast of France have produced information as to the movements of shipping and aircraft. On two occasions enemy fighters have been shot down by these aircraft. Minelaying has been successfully undertaken bySwordfish in the Ems River and at Hubert Gat (Friesian Islands).Middle East and Mediterranean.Malta.46. There has been very little Italian air activity over Malta. This com-paratively peaceful period has enabled the dockyards to revert to almost normalconditions. On the 13th August nine Swordfish carried out an attack on Augustaharbour and shipping as reported in the &quot; Naval Situation.&quot; On the same dayan ineffective attack was made by enemy bombers on Hal-Far, Grand harbour and district.Egypt.47. On the 8th August a very successful action was fought by thirteenGladiators who completely surprised a formation of 27 enemy fighters across the libyan frontier. Altogether fifteen enemy fighters were brought down with theloss of only two Gladiators, the pilot of one being subsequently rescued.Throughout the week numerous air reconnaissances have been undertaken.On the 7th August Blenheims made a successful attack on a dump nearBardia.On the 9th August during an attack on enemy shipping in Tobruk harbourone ship was set on fire and other damage was caused, and on the 12th August two small vessels were hit. On the following day nine Blenheims attacked an enemycamp at Gabr Saleh scoring numerous hits.Enemy aircraft attacked Mersa Matruh on the 8th August without result, andon the 13th August 10 S.79&apos;s bombed Sidi Barrani without inflicting anycasualties.Sudan.48. On the 7th August attacks were made on the submarine base and airforce headquarters at Massawa. Flits were scored on a naval vessel and onthe quay. Two days later a further attack was made and damage is reported tothe Air Force barracks and what is reported to have been an A.A. Battery. FiveWellesleys attacked the fuel dump at Nai Adaga (50 miles S.W. of Massawa),but were unable to observe results. All our aircraft were seriously damaged by enemy fighters. One enemy fighter is claimed to have been shot down. On the10th August a low-level attack was made by five Wellesleys on Barentu Aerodrome(130 miles W.S.W. of Massawa). Aircraft on the ground were attacked with bombs and machine guns. During the week enemy aircraft raided the Summitarea three times unsuccessfully. Gaheit was also bombed, causing 12 minorcasualties. S. 79 aircraft were used, but our fighters were not fast enough to engage them.Aden and Sonialiland.49. Our bomber aircraft continue .to provide close support to our forcesdisputing the Italian advance in Somaliland. In addition, the aerodrome atJigjiga was attacked. Attacks by enemy fighters have been carried out with verymuch more determination since the Italian advance commenced.
The enemy carried out a number of raids on the harbour and aerodrome atBerbera. On the 13th two enemy fighters attacked with machine-gun fire twoBlenheims which had previously been forced to land. A.A. fire from.M.S. Carlisle disabled one of the fighters and the pilot was captured.Kenya.50. A number of reconnaissances were carried out by aircraft of the SouthAfrican Air Force. As a result of a bombing attack on Neghelli, two Capronisare reported to have been destroyed.Italian Intelligence.Italian Air Force Morale.51. From prisoners&apos; statements in general, it seems that the morale of theaverage pilot is quite high and that he is satisfied with the Fascist regime. Theirblind faith in the future trend of events appears to be similar to that of the Nazis.There appears to have been some progress in eliminating the distinctions betweenthe Regular and black shirt Air Force Officer.Dodecanese.Movement of Aircraft.52. The reported departure from Rhodes of the 41st and 42nd Gruppi,consisting of about 30 S. 79 bombers, is unexpected. These units constitute thefamous 12th Bomber Stormo, known in the Italian Air Force as the &quot; GreenMice,&quot; which was responsible for the raids on Haifa and for air action againstthe Fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean. This move may indicate the return oftbe Stormo to its last base, which is believed to have been somewhere in Sicily,although other reports are to the effect that it may be ultimately operating under german command against Great Britain.Libya.Movement of Air Headquarters.53. It is reliably reported that the Libyan Air Headquarters were moved from Tripoli to Benghazi on the 3rd August, and was expected to function there as from the 6th August.
