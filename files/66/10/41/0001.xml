CRLPPS&apos;S VIEWS ON THE POST-WAR POSITION OF THEBRITISH EMPIRE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may be interested to read the accompanying letter from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow, with its enclosure, wnich formed the original draft for the suggestions that were condensed into Sir Stariord urippsstelegrams Nos. 384 and 385 of tihe 27th June last.H,Foreign Office, A ugust 8, 1940.Sir S. Cripps to Viscount Halifax;.(Personal.),My dear Lord Halifax, Moscow, June 27, 1940.I ENCLOSE the original draft of the suggestions which were condensed intomy private telegrams Nos. 384 and 385 of the 27th June., In more normal timesthey would naturally have gone to you in letter form in the first instance.Yours very truly,R. STAFFORD CRIPPS.Enclosure.THOUGH it is strictly outside my present sphere of activity, I trust thatyou will not mind my putting forward the following observations as worthy theconsideration of yourself and your colleagues : 1. The refusal of the French Government by a majority to carry,on the war from outside France, following the French collapse, emphasised the extreme difficulty of persuading a nation as a whole, or even its rulers, to take sosupremely drastic a step when the possibility of its becoming necessary has notbeen canvassed or prepared for in advance and when the population and all meansof propaganda and information are in confusion as the result of enemy action.2. The last-minute attempt by His Majesty&apos;s Government to hold the twocountries together by substituting for the Alliance a more permanent, form of union was too sudden and unexplored, and raised in such circumstances too many points which were capable of arousing alarm and prejudice in the minds of manyFrenchmen of all classes for it to meet with success.11129   [21618]
3. The future may produce conditions for Great Britain of a not dissimilarkind in that some drastic step may have to be taken to carry through the war tosuccess, and its proposal, if not properly prepared for, may bring to the surfacea division of opinion as fatal to the necessary action as that in France to-day.. 4. Under such circumstances it is, in my opinion, vitally necessary to explore forthwith the lines along which policy may have to be directed withsuddenness in likely event of a large-scale devastation of Great Britain fromthe air. This is all the more so if the success of such a policy depends upon theco-operation of another country in an unexpected or unexplored manner.5. While any such policy must necessarily be determined on the basis of theimmediate war situation, it would be advantageous if it could also be in the right direction for some more stable post-war conditions.8. As the result of what has already taken place in Europe, which hasconclusively demonstrated the overwhelming advantage possessed by highly-industrialised and rigidly-controlled major countries, it is now clear that in thefuture the smaller nations will at best be the satellites of some larger neighbour,falling under the influence of its foreign policy and relying upon it for their defence. Small national units are in the present circumstances incapable, evenin the aggregate, of creating or sustaining the necessary air and mechanisedstrength to make them any match for the highly-organised large Powers.7. We are therefore rapidly moving towards a state of affairs in whichthe world power groupings will of necessity be on a very much larger scale thanthose hitherto contemplated. The old conception of a balance of power withinEurope has now disappeared. With the collapse of France and the subsequentaction of Petain&apos;s government, and the hostility that will now be stirred up bythe German-controlled French wireless against Great Britain, it is no longer possible to envisage a fusion of the French and British interests, even if sucha thing was ever possible.8. It is essential in the present circumstances that Great Britain itself,owing to the likelihood of the physical destruction and consequent disorganisation of its industries, transport, &amp;c, and the inevitable devastation and possibleinvasion that will follow, should recognize itself as merely the outpost of somemuch greater whole, rather than as the essential and all-important centre of thatlarger unit.9. That whole is at the moment represented by the British Empire, which,though extensive and powerful in man-power, is very widely scattered and, apartfrom Great Britain itself, is not strong in vital industrial power. So long asthat whole remains constituted as it is, the devastation or conquest of GreatBritain itself must be regarded as wiping out for a very considerable period oftime the war potential, save in so far as the friendly help of the United Statescan be relied upon.10. It would nevertheless be a task of the greatest difficulty to get theBritish people or their representatives to approve or agree to an unexpected andsudden move of government to (say) Canada in the conditions that would thenbe prevailing in Great Britain, as it was to get the French to move their government out of France, and the result of such an effort would in my opinionbe uncertain, since any major degree of opposition to it would render it practically impossible or ineffective in the sense that those remaining in England might setup an alternative government to conclude peace with Hitler. These difficultiesmust not in my view be under-estimated.11. From a long-term point of view, and regarding the power politics ofthe post-war world, it appears that there are likely to be four main-powergroups : (a) an Asiatic, probably under Japanese, but possibly under Sino-Japanesehegemony;(b) a Euro-Asiatic, under Russia, including the Baltic States and part ofthe Balkans (subject to paragraph 12 below);(c) a European under the domination of one major European power,including Scandinavia, part of the Balkans and the Near East;(d) an American, under the influence of the U.SA.
12; It is possible if China collapses, as now seems more than possible, anda ioint attack by Japan and Germany upon the U.S.S.R. materialises, thatcroup (b) may disappear, though this is unlikely, or may be diminished to aSiere buffer between groups (a) and (c).13. Into such an arrangement of power groups the British Empire doesnot naturally fall as a unit, and it is difficult to see how it can be maintainedas a balancing factor unless Great Britain becomes the major power underoroup (c), or if this is not practicable, how any balance can be preserved withsome other power, e.g., Germany, dominating group (c).It does not seem to me to be a practical possibility for a country so com-paratively small and situated so far from the centre of Europe as Great britain to dominate group (c) with any degree of permanence or safety under theconditions of modern warfare.14. A solution, and one which would make possible a future stable balanceof power in the world, at least for a considerable period of time, and whichwould at the same time (a) bring the maximum immediate assistance to GreatBritain, (&amp;) provide a rational basis for the removal of the British Governmentin case of necessity to Canada, is for us to be associated with the United states in an Anglo-Saxon group which would have features of permanence greater thanthose, e.g., of our alliance with France.15. Such an arrangement, if it could be brought about, would mean thatGreat Britain would form part of group (d) above, and would constitute GreatBritain as the European outpost of that group and its link with group (c).16. The prestige and power of such a group would have an immediate effecton the war situation, since it should be apparent to Hitler that he could neverconquer such a union. Whether a stale-mate ensued, or whether Hitler were able successfully to invade Great Britain, the position of the Anglo-Saxonfederation would be immensely strong and something with which he would be bound to reckon.17. I fully realise the many difficulties inherent in this drastic suggestionboth from the point of view of the British people and of the Americans, who will no doubt be alarmed, as were the French, at the prospect of a closer association with Great Britain.18. No doubt the centre of gravity of the political life of the two countries would shift to the American continent, and Great Britain would become merely the European outpost of an Anglo-Saxon group largely concentrated in the West.19. It may well be that before long such a policy will be shown to be theonly practical and permanent method of saving Anglo-Saxon civilisation, but itwill be too late to attempt it then, as an emergency act, if the ground has notbeforehand been completely explored and canvassed in both countries.20. While not suggesting any publicity or propaganda on this subject at themoment except in the most carefully prepared and indirect way, I would stronglyurge that the practicability of such a change and the means of carrying it out should be explored forthwith, and that some tentative approaches might be madeprivately to such persons as Frankfurter in the United States so as to get their actions and advice.21. Please excuse this incursion into the general political situation, but i feel so strongly on this point that I should not feel justified in withholding my views as I believe that this is a case which at least merits careful consideration.
