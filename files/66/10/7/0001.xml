Printed for the Wari Cabinet.  July 1940.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (40) 276.July 18, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.GRANT OF AIR FACILITIES TO THE UNITED STATES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN a telegram of the 24th May, 1940 (attached as Annex 1), His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington outlined proposals for the grant of naval and airfacilities to the United States in neighbouring British colonies and Newfound-land. These proposals were strongly endorsed by the Chiefs of Staff Committeein their aide-memoire W.P. (40) 174, but were rejected by the War Cabinet attheir 146th (40) meeting on the 29th May, 1940. The decision of the War cabinet was conveyed to Lord Lothian in a telegram of the 2nd June (Annex 2). On the22nd June Lord Lothian replied (Annex 3) intimating that, whilst in view of theWar Cabinet&apos;s objections he did not propose to press his proposals, he wouldbe grateful to receive authority to inform the State Department that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would agree to enter into the following arrangements,which he had ascertained through informal channels would meet what theAmerican Army and Air Force regarded as their immediate needs for purposesof national defence  (a) Facilities for United States military aircraft to land in Jamaica, George-town (British Guiana) and Trinidad.(b) A lease to Pan-American Airways, acting as agents of the United StatesGovernment, of a small area near the Trinidad aerodrome wherecertain facilities would be required.(c) A lease of approximately a square mile for an aerodrome in british guiana.(d) Permission for Pan-American Airways to construct an aerodrome nearKingston, Jamaica.(e) Authority for the United States Army to send occasional training flightsto a Newfoundland airport.2. Following upon interdepartmental discussions, it was suggested to theChiefs of Staff Committee that Lord Lothian&apos;s above-mentioned proposals shouldbe considered. I understand, however, that the Committee&apos;s full endorsement of the Ambassador^ earlier and wider proposals applied a fortiori to the more restricted facilities now suggested, and that there was, therefore, no occasion fora further report on their part. Lord Lothian&apos;s latest proposals have been referredto the Governors of Jamaica, Trinidad and British Guiana, who are in favourof their adoption so far as local considerations are concerned (see theirtelegrams attached as Annex 4). The Government of Newfoundland (Annex 5)see no objection to proposal (e) above, and the Canadian Government (Annex 6)have replied that they consider it highly desirable that the facilities inquestion should be afforded.    In  subsequent telegrams Lord Lothian has11114   [21544]b
emphasised the need for an urgent favourable response to his recommenda-tions (i) because of the rising popular demand in the United States thatall the Caribbean islands should be acquired in the interests of Americandefence, and (ii) because the question of acquiring all Caribbean islands-may possibly be raised by the Latin American Republics at their forthcoming conference at Havana, which is to open on the 20th July. Lord- Lothianhas also drawn attention to the fact that Congress has just voted large sums toenable Pan-American Airways to construct aerodromes in South and central america, and he expresses his conviction that by hook or by crook this expenditure will be made effective for aerial defence for the whole of the Central Americanregion.3. Whilst there is.force in Lord Lothian&apos;s argument that by making theoffer recommended in his telegram of the 22nd June it will prove possible tostave off wider demands, the main argument in favour of action in the sense proposed is that it corresponds to a realistic view of Anglo-American relationsboth in the present and in the future. For not only do we require all the helpwe can get in the present, but the future of our widely scattered Empire islikely to depend on the evolution of an effective and enduring collaboration between ourselves and the United States. This may be an obvious necessity forus, but for America it is a new and startling doctrine.4. Our aim should surely be to; assist. America in the task of assuminga new and heavy responsibility for which so little in her tradition and historyhas prepared her. A successful relationship between the two English-speakinggroups implies not only an assumption of responsibilities on America&apos;s part but,equally, a generous recognition by us of the fact that a responsibility involves aright to the means for discharging it. Until late in the last war it was GreatBritain, almost alone, who for nearly a century had guarded the English-speakingpeoples by sea, and it is still the British Empire, rather than America, whopossesses the naval and air facilities (actual and potential) which protect theAmerican continents. But in future we may well neither be capable of performingthese functions unaided, nor can we reasonably hope for cordial co-operation from america unless we share with her the strategic facilities which these duties willrequire. At this very moment it is only fair to recognise that if Britain wereto be defeated America would have the task of defending her eastern shoreswithout any prepared air bases under her own control in the Atlantic Ocean. Itseems inconceivable that America should tolerate such a situation, or that any-thing except bitterness could result from a failure on our part to recognise it.5. The practical alternatives open to us would seem to be either to makeAmerica a free offer of the immediate facilities she needs or to drive a bargainand attempt to obtain some specific quid pro quo in exchange. The second alternative is open to the objection that we are already heavily in debt to america as a result of the last war, and that we shall shortly be still further in her debtas a condition of winning the present war. We have no hope of ever repayingthe enormous sums which will be involved, nor do well informed Americans everexpect this of us.-6. The Americans are hard bargainers, but they are generous and large-hearted friends, and they do not stint their kindly impulses. Thus, thousands of our poorest children are being offered homes on the other side for the duration of the war, but we have not been asked for anything in return. Nor did it occurto any American that the modification of their neutrality laws, shortly after thebeginning of the war, might be made the basis of a &quot; deal.&quot; It is with America&apos;consent, and very much against her immediate economic advantage, that wemaintain our. contraband control. She could break our blockade of europe to-morrow if she wished, and thereby greatly ease her political and economic relations with the republics in the Southern Continent. For none of these thingsdoes America exact a price from us;7. If our aim is to foster a habit of cordial co-operation between theEnglish-speaking countries, this can hardly be achieved on a basis of &quot; tit fortat&quot;; it can only develop through the habitual exercise of friendly assistancefreely given, together with a general recognition of the other country&apos;s needs and
feelings. It must in any case be remembered that it is not within the power ofthe United States Government to grant any substantial concessions to us,e.g., destroyers, without the consent of Congress, which depends in turn upon the evolution of public opinion.8. On grounds of immediate advantage and also of our future relationswith the United States I would therefore suggest that Lord Lothian should beauthorised to offer to the State Department, without asking for any quid proquo, the facilities immediately required by the United States Army and AirForce detailed earlier in this paper, subject to such temporary safeguards as maybe required by His Majesty&apos;s forces, for the duration of the war. Unless,however, these safeguards are kept to an absolute minimum, not much of value will be left to offer to the Americans, and in practice the added securityresulting from closer and more cordial relations with the United States should in the long run abundantly outweigh any security we could obtain by pursuing a narrowly self-centred policy.H.July 18, 1940.ANNEX 1.The Marquess of Lothian to Viscount Halifax. (Received May 25.)(No. 814.   Secret.   Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, May 24, 1940.AMERICAN anxiety about its own security has brought to the front in public discussions the question of the future of British and French islands offeastern coast of America. Many suggestions are being made for their disposal to United States in part payment of war debts. President has always discouragedsuch discussion. Privately, I say that there can be no question of discussing anysuch transaction at present. I think, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould seriously consider officially a formal offer to United States to allow it toconstruct aerodromes and naval stations on British islands which are ofimportance to its security. I understand that the two places United states authorities are most concerned about are Trinidad and Newfoundland : Trinidadbecause an air base there would enable United States to deal with possible Germanand Italian air developments in [? Brazil] threatening the Canal, and newfoundland because of possible German threats [two groups undecypherable][ ? overthrow rights of Iceland, and which to-day is quite undefended]. Theyare also interested in facilities at Bermuda. If you agree, I should like to beauthorised to inform the President that His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the seriousness of the new threat to America&apos;s security, and that, while they arenot in a position to discuss any modifications of sovereignty, they would beprepared to consider immediate lease of areas to the United States for constructionof air fields or naval stations on any of these islands which the United Statesconsider important from the point of view of its own defence. In effect, this isonly an extension of the proposal that was informally agreed to last year, butnever carried out. I would not connect it at all with war debts instalment, butI consider public announcement of our readiness to help the United States in organising its defence in this way would make a deep impression here, and, inpractice, would add to security of our position and would involve active co-operation between the United States and British Commonwealth in naval andair defence.  No member of Administration has said anything to me.If you act now it would have all the advantage of spontaneity. The sooneryou can give me the decision the better, as if proposal is to have full effectCongress ought to vote appropriation before it adjourns early in June.(Repeated to Ottawa, No. 62.)[21544]
ANNEX 2.Viscount Halifax to the Marquess of Lothian (Washington).(No. 981.)(Telegraphic.)Foreign Office, June 2, 1940.YOUR telegram No. 814 [of the 24th May : Suggested grant of facilities in British possessions to United States of America!2. Your suggestion has been examined by War Cabinet, who see followingobjections : (1) If His Majesty&apos;s Government were to make a formal offer of. this kindwith the express object of facilitating the defence of the UnitedStates of America the question of sovereignty could hardly fail to arise. United States would at our invitation be spending large sums of money on fixtures in the islands and would naturally requiresecurity. In particular leases on a large scale at Trinidad with itsvital oil fields would involve investment of large American plant and capital and United States Government would tend to obtain acontrolling interest there.(2) Only facilities in Newfoundland which are likely to be of value to UnitedStates of America would be those of airport. This has only just beencompleted and cost three quarters of a million pounds and negotiations are in progress for Canadian Government to assume responsibilityfor it for the duration of the war. His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom are at present in the position of trustees for people of Newfoundland, and handing over of the airport toAmericans might well arouse resentment there. It would in any case be necessary to consult Newfoundland before proceeding to action,and it would also be necessary to consult, Canada, both becauseCanada&apos;s defence is intimately bound up with that of Newfoundland,and because of the wartime arrangement referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph.(3) Once the matter had been broached with the President it would bedifficult to recede if the foregoing political objections appearedinsuperable.(4) As we see it Isolationists in the United States of America might wellmake political capital out of any offer which came from our side,as either attempt to involve United States of America, or as evidencethat we were in mood of despair.(5) A definite assurance of concrete results sufficiently advantageous to usshould be a prerequisite for concession on our part.3. In these circumstances we should be glad to learn what reasons you have for considering that if political objections could be overcome really substantialadvantages would accrue to us from approaching the United States with suchan offer, which in the meantime should not be broached with the President.4. Incidentally, following upon the United States request last year, arisingout of proposed neutrality patrol but ostensibly with a view to facilitatingAmerican naval manoeuvres, His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed to negotiationswith the colonial authorities concerned which resulted in lease of sites to UnitedStates naval authorities at Trinidad, Bermuda and St. Lucia. Although nothingfurther has since been heard of the matter, we have no information that theUnited States Government have relinquished their rights. It would thereforeseem that if they wish to do so United States Government are in a position totake at least some action without any further offer on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. The fact that they have not moved suggests that at present theydo not wish to do so.
ANNEX 3.The Marquess of Lothian to Viscount Halifax. (Received June 23.)(No. 1086.) . . :,(Telegraphic.) Washington, June 22, 1940.YOUR telegram No. 981.In view of objections seen by the Cabinet, and to the march of events, whichis rapidly educating American public opinion to vital importance of Great- Britain itself as first line of American defence, I do not purpose to press my proposal for the present. I have, however, been able to ascertain through informalchannels what American army and air force^regarcTas&quot; their immediate needs forpurposes of national defence.In the first place, they would like American military aircraft to be given theright to land_il^l_JJJinaica^__at Georgetown (British Guiana) and at Trinidad.SecondlyrtheynvbuTd like Pan-American Airways, acting as their agen*ts7&quot;td beleased a small area approximately 1,500 feet by 500 feet adjacent to Trinidad\ aerodrome, where they could store supplies, erect a small radio station, &amp;c.I Thirdly, they would like Pan-American to be leased an area of approximately aI square mile, on which the company could construct an aerodrome with theI necessary building near Georgetown, British Guiana.   Fourthly, they would likeI Pan-American Airways to be allowed to construct an aerodrome hear Kingston,I Jamaica, on similar terms to seaplane station they already have there.The advantage of this proposal is that there is no question of the United&apos;I States Government acquiring any long lease exercising any kind of authority inI the islands. The work would be done and paid for by Pan-American Airways onI an ordinary commercial basis, but the United&apos; States army would use these aerodromes, &amp;c, in connexion with defence of approach to Canal Zone and also with a view to speedy air reinforcement of South American republics in theI event of Nazi-inspired trouble there. Proposal, in fact, is on all fours withI one which was worked out for the navy rather more than a year ago. In view ofI value to ourselves of defensive collaboration between American forces &quot;and our own, and in order to cut away part of the ground from under growing demandI in popular press that the United States should take over all islands off coasts,I partly to improve their own defences and partly to forestall claims by Germany,I I hope that you will authorise me to inform State Department that His Majesty&apos;s! Government would agree to enter into such an arrangement if details could beI worked outArmy would also like authority to send occasional training flights toI Newfoundland airport.Arrangement would, of course, be for the duration of the-war.(Repeated to Ottawa, No. 89 (by post).)ANNEX 4.(1)Telegram from the Governor of Jamaica to the Secretary of State for theColonies. (Received July 13.)(No. 354.  Most Secret.) July 13. 1940.YOUR telegram No. 349.Facilities for pan-American aerodrome. I am strongly in favour of approvalsubject to the usual conditions which would presumably include right of British; planes to use and liability to resumption. There is an ideal site less than milefrom Kingston near Spanish Town.   Approximate cost of acquisition, runways; and buildings would be  50,000.  It would probably be better if construction were: done by us to their specification on agency basis.
(3)Telegram from the Governor of British Guiana to the Secretary of State for theColonies. (Received July 12.)(No. 277.  Most Secret.) July 12, 1940.YOUR telegram No. 244. I see no objection from local standpoint toproposal for the (?) lease of aerodrome near Georgetown to Pan-american airways, nor do I think that there would be any antagonism in the Colonygenerally. I presume that condition would be made that airfield would be opento use by British aircraft, with right to rent hangars and other necessarybuildings so far as available.I have always regarded this Colony as within the natural sphere of operations of American air lines between North and South America, and believethat the best interests of the Colony lie in facilitating such operations. In myopinion it would be better that American Airways should be encouraged to place an important airfield here rather than that they should be driven to Dutch orFrench territory outside any possible influence or control by us.ANNEX 5.Telegram from the Government of Newfoundland to the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs. (Received July 14.)(No. 463.   Secret,   Immediate.) July 14, 1940.YOUR telegram No. 542, Secret, 13th July. We see no objection asregards (e), but please emphasise complete absence of any spare accommodation at Botwood and Newfoundland Air Port for either personnel or planes.Advisable Americans should send one plane only in the first instance to obtain information.ANNEX. 6.Telegram from, the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Canada to theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs. (Received July 17.)(No. 1758.   Secret.   Immediate.) July 17, 1940.\TOUR telegram of 14th July, No. 1673; your telegram of 16th July,No. 1684.Letter received this morning states that Canadian Government are ofopinion that proposed activities would be an effective contribution in north american defence and consider it highly desirable that facilities in question should be afforded.  This telegram has not been repeated to Washington.   Ends.Telegram from the Governor of Trinidad to the Secretary of State for theColonies. (Received July 13.)(No. 480.  Most Secret.) July 12, 1940.YOUR telegram No. 469, Most Secret. I have discussed question of facilities for air bases with my advisers, and am assuming that, in view ofassistance which is being rendered to United Kingdom by United States ofAmerica, no (repeat no) objection will be raised to offer any such facilities inTrinidad which His Majesty&apos;s Government considers desirable. arrangements can readily be made to lease an area near Piarco aerodrome to Pan-american airways as contemplated. I assume that any lease would be terminable as incase of that already granted.
