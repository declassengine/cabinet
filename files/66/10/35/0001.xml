Air Units03. The original, intention was to^despatch if possible a complete bomber and a complete fighter squadron, but thereare not sufficient French air personnel in the UnitedKingdom to form two squadrons.    The most that can be doneis to form one fighter flight and one bomber flight.    these would absorb all the French mechanics available and itmight be necessary to utilise some mechanics who are now inthe early stage of training as pilots.There are sufficient French flying crews under training to make up the two flights to two squadrons in: about six weeks to two months, but there are no mechanicsavailable or in sight beyond those absorbed into the twooriginal flights.      These two flights will consist ofhastily assembled personnel, and of mechanics with no knowledge of or training on the types of aircraft whichcould be supplied.We should resist any French claim that they canraise more than two flights.    Mechanics do not exist and remaining pilots are definitely unfit for service on british types without further training,,Hurricane and Battle aircraft can be provided,crated,  at Liverpool by 13th; but only by ^taking theHurricanes from the next consignment iearmarked for theMiddle &quot;East lit &quot;is impossible to tropicalise and packothers in the time), ^nd^JBattle^^by, taking them from thoseearmarked for the Empire Training Scheme.i &apos;&apos; &apos; .11-...... in   WMu- ... u      ...1..-      i      i       Ji i i......      .

It is known,however, that the tanks are already en route for Aldershotand it is considered that about three to four days will besufficient for the tank crews to shake down before theyleave Aldershot.      It is probable that the French M.T.vehicles are not fit to be sent overseas, and we haveascertained that the necessary M0T. can be provided at short notice from British sources.      Certain signal andengineer equipment will also be required.    Provided thatthe necessary items are available and that issue toGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s force is given the highest priority, weanticipate that the force should be fully equipped and readyto leave Aldershot on the. night of the 10th August,

5, If for1 any reason it shduld^^ej^ome necessary forthe expedition to put into a British VVest^ri^Bdjisrn-por-t-;&quot;recent experience has shown that these ports suffer from lack of accommodation and of food reserves for any influx of troops,    This is particularly the case at Freetown,where there is literally no spare accommodation5. and onthe Gold Coast where the arrival of 500 French Europeantroops has created a serious food shortage.    In Nigeriathe problem may be loss acute.      We are unable to say how the French West African colonies stand in these respects.Although tents are far from ideal as accommodation, at this time of the year when the rains are at their height,  it-is considered that the fores should be despatched completewith tent age&apos;., mosquito&apos; nets etc.      In addition we recommendthat, as in the case of British reinforcements,  SO dayssupplies should accompany the force.66 The problem is to disembark a force of all armsincluding guns,  13--ton tanks. vehicles and casedaircraft,  and the facilities of the West African port are somewhat limited,.    Only the following French ports are suitable:-:An excellent modern port with allfacilities,.(French Guinea)  - a small port, hutsuitable for disembarkation of MCT,and stores alongside^ and of troops bytender or &quot;boats,.M.TC  and Store Ships could dischargealongside at Duala.    Troop ships couldnot reach the port and would have todisembark into tenders or boatsat the anchorage some 12 miles fromthe port,.i _7o It had been intended that French troopships mannedas far as possible by French crews should be employed,but there is at present only one suitable and availablein the United Kingdom, namelys the S,SC. Forbin^      one other British troopship will probably be required and this can be provided in time for the expeditionc.      Two HUT.ships, carrying both M0To and stores, will be required and these can be made available (they may be eitherBritish orJFrench),This shipping commitment does not interfere withany other projected troop movement, provided the expedition?conforms approximately to the time table in paragraphbelowa80 ;Only one French warship, with sufficient endurancefor the voyage,, namely the sloop &quot;Savorgnan de Braaza&quot;manned by the Free French Navy, is likely to be available.Naval Escorts.Shipping,BbALAKOTAKRIDAKARPorts of Arrlyal0Accommodation and Food Supplies(.

If the force is fully equipped at Aldershot by the 10th august the earliest possible sailing date for the two M.T.ships will be August 13th and the rough time table forthe expedition could be as follows;-Cabinet Decision 5th August.Force mobilised at Aldershot. 10th August.M.T.  and Store ships commence loading.. 11th August,M.T0 and store ships sail from Liverpool., 13th August.M.T6 and Store ships arriveat: - Cor re s^onciin^ Jiate; of;sailin.:&apos;.&quot; of troop, ships,to synshronize^Dakar    -   August 28th August 19 th.Konakri - August 30th - August 20th0Duala    -   September 5th -----    August 23rd,The,^ahoye, programme,- will he dependent on aCabinet Decision on MondayV &quot;5th August,*Security.10. It will be very difficult to keep these operations secret.      The troops have to be concentratedand equipped for service under tropical conditions andit is inevitable that this will give rise to speculationas to their destination.      It will be essential that both officers and men should be provided with some pretext for the preparations which will not divulge the realintention.    We are arranging for this question to be examined and for General de Gaulle to be informed ofa suitable cover.,11. If the above proposals  ire accepted by theWar Cabinet we recommend that representatives ofGeneral de Gaulle*s staff should be attached to theInter-Services Planning Staffs in Service Departmentsso that they may work out all the details in close collaboration,,(Sgd.)
