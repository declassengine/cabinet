Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1940.SECRET. Copy No.  QW.P. (40) 272A.July 30, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.INDIA.THE following telegrams which have passed between the Viceroy and theSecretary of State are circulated in continuation of the correspondence circulated in W.P. (40) 272.(1)Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor-General, dated July 2, 1940.(Important.)3461. I am greatly obliged to you for your most helpful series of telegramsending with your telegram dated 1st July, 1187-S, and I note with satisfactionhow closely in accord our minds are on this matter. I hope to make proposals to the Cabinet this week-end for consideration early next week. I am definitelyin favour for the same reasons as yourself of a further declaration, and hope to have a draft statement ready for approval by the Cabinet. I should proposeto telegraph the text to you in time to admit of any comments or criticismsyou have to offer being considered by the Cabinet.2. In this connexion I feel just a little doubt whether the plan you indicate in paragraph 6 of your 1187-S is tactically the soundest. I should have thoughtthat the right course was to issue our statement first and then to base your firminvitations to co-operate upon it rather than upon tentative indications of thepossible content of such a statement before it is made. (The form of statement i contemplate is one to be made by yourself with the authority of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and I should propose myself on the day you put it out to recite the text of it in the House of Commons in answer to a question to be followed, no doubt,by a debate in the next few days.) I do not mean by this to suggest that you shouldabstain from taking any further informal soundings which you judge expedienteither at Delhi or Simla, but I am inclined to suggest, if you agree with me on thispoint, that you should do no more in such soundings than indicate the probability that His Majesty&apos;s Government will find it desirable to give some furtherindication of their post-war intentions with regard to India&apos;s Constitutionwithout going far into details. It follows from what I have said that I think you should avoid inviting opinions as to the advantage of making such astatement.3. On one important point in your 1187 I should be glad of some clearerindication of your views. You have balanced the arguments for and againstsubstituting a civilian Army Member for Commander-in-Chief in your ExecutiveCouncil, and I am not sure whether your use in one place of the word &quot; fatal &quot;means that you have reached a final conclusion against recommending such achange. I myself doubt whether the existence of a civilian in the background,[21565] B
as in a sense before Kitchener&apos;s reorganisation, would seriously affect the positionof the Commander-in-Chief in the eyes of the Army with which he would havepossibly some time to come into direct contact, and see great psychologicaladvantages in this particular change, both in India and in America, and should feel strongly inclined to recommend it to the Cabinet, though it may be, of course,that they would, like their predecessors, decline to agree.4. I await your telegram reporting Governors&apos;&quot; reactions to a scheme onJinnah&apos;s lines for the section 93, Provinces, and hope you will be able to let me have this, if not by Friday evening, then at all events in time to circulate tothe Cabinet in continuation not later than early Monday morning.(2)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 3, 1940.(Important.)1215-S. Your telegram of 2nd July, 3461, just received. Very many thanks.I will comment as soon as possible. Meanwhile I think it will be well to let yousee in extenso replies of Governors to my reference to them, and will telegraphthem as received. I will telegraph my own comment once they are complete and fully appreciate time-table to which you are anxious to work. Only outstanding&quot;contacts&quot; are Savarkar, whom I am seeing on fifth and Jam Sahib who isspending week-end with me.2. Position has been changed in one respect by the arrest yesterday ofSubhas Bose. I have asked Herbert to telegraph, repeating to you, full accountof circumstances. No doubt owing to some sudden development, arrest was made without prior warning to me.(3)Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor-General^ dated July 3, 1940.(Immediate.)3506. My immediately succeeding telegram gives text of draft which Ipropose to submit to Cabinet subject to any comments you have to make. Pleaselet me have these if possible by Friday mid-day and at the latest by Mondaymorning.2. It seems to me of importance to make the statement proper as concise aspossible with a view to securing for it effective world-wide publicity and attention, and I have kept this consistently in mind throughout. In one particular in this connexion I should like your advice. My strong preferencewould be to keep the enumeration of obligations in paragraph 5 as short aspossible, and not to put out the exhaustive list which was contained inparagraph 3 (v) of my telegram 754, dated 17th June. Apart frGm the object ofbrevity, I should be inclined to fear that a list which purported to be exhaustivemight be found to be defective, and that any subsequent additions would be allthe more open to Indian criticism.(4)Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor-General, dated July 3, 1940.(Immediate.)3507, My immediately preceding telegram. Following is text of draft declaration :  1. At this moment in the world struggle against aggression and tyrannyHis Majesty&apos;s Government feel assured that it is the earnest wish of the g;reatmajority of the people of India to throw themselves wholeheartedly and unitedlyinto the defence of their country and of the common cause. They believe thatthis unity of national purpose will be helped, and some of the misunderstandings
which have arisen in recent months removed; by a clear statement of theirattitude to the steps to be taken towards the declared goal of British policy inIndia.2. It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government that India should attain,at the earliest practicable moment after the war, to her natural and rightfulposition as an equal partner-member in the British Commonwealth of Nations,as free to control her own affairs and shape her own destiny as the UnitedKingdom or the Dominions.3. They recognise the right -of India herself to frame the permanent--structure of the Constitution under which she is to regulate her own -affairs.They are therefore willing that immediately after the war the Constitution shouldbe examined anew in all its aspects, central and provincial, by whatever Indianconstituent body may meanwhile be agreed upon by representatives of the main elements in India&apos;s national life.4. Agreement is of the essence of the matter. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould not contemplate surrendering their present responsibility for the peace and welfare of India to any system of government whose authority was directlydenied by large and powerful elements in India&apos;s national life, nor could they be parties to the coercion of such elements into submission to such a government.They are convinced that agreement is possible, and is desired by the vast majoritypf the people of India. For their part they would be most willing to examineforthwith all possibilities of overcoming the inherent difficulties of the situationand to lend any assistance in their power to bring the various parties together.It follows, of course, that the same principle of agreement must form thebasis of decisions to be taken as to the composition of the constituent body, themethod of selecting its members and the machinery by which it will arrive at its conclusions.5. Given the necessary measure of agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare prepared to accqpt as the permanent structure of the new Indian polity theprovisions of any Indian Constitution that may be adopted by such.a constituentbody. This permanent structure will not necessarily of itself make provision forthe existing responsibilities and obligations which Great Britain&apos;s long connexionwith India has imposed upon her, or for the necessity for close co-operation in defence and foreign policy which will subsist until India is able to meet unaidedher needs in this field. The principal obligations here referred to, besides those relating to India&apos;-s defence, concern the fulfilment of obligations to the States inso far as they are not completely incorporated in the new Indian polity, and the securing of the reasonable rights of existing members of the Services recruitedby the Secretary of State.It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that these Obligations and needscan * most appropriately be fulfilled through the provisions of an Instrument ofAgreement as between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the proposed constituentbody acting on behalf of the new Government of India. This agreement wouldbe for a stated period of years renewable by negotiation in so far as circumstances might require and would;for its duration be.embodied as an integral part of thenew Indian Constitution and enter into force concurrently with&apos;it.6. It is&apos;obvious that no such-fundamental reconsideration ;0f the existingIndian Constitution can take place in the.midst.of. a great war. ^But within thatConstitution His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to enlist to the full the active co-operation of all parties and elements in the-political life of India. Inpursuance of that object ;His Excellency the-Governor-General has been, authorisedto invite representatives of the more important parties and communities inBritish India to join his Executive Council, as well as-to associate with themin a wider War Council representatives of the Indian :States, and of^other interestsin the national life of India.as a whole. The Governors of the -Provinces,nowdirectly administered under s.93of the Government, of India Act ;have beensimilarly instructed to further any steps which will facilitate the resumptionwith general assent of responsible government in their provinces.His Majesty &apos;-s Government hope and believe that, in this way India will j bei able, even within the limits of the present Constitution, to play. her. appropriatepart in the conduct of the war and tojprepare;herself for the tasks of rja-, full, and free national life which. lie before her.[21565]b.2
Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 7, 1940.(Immediate.)1278-S. I have done my best to consider the very important matters arisingout of the draft declaration contained in your telegram of 3rd July, No. 3507. Ishould have preferred, given the importance and complexity of these matters, tohave taken longer to examine it. But in the interests of saving time I send you that redraft at once, subject, however, to the caveat which I should like mentioned to the Cabinet that I may wish to make further amendments, though I would hope not of consequence, in the light of still closer examination.2. I have, as you will see, made a large number of drafting alterations someof which are important and one or two alterations of substance. Text of delclaration in form in which I suggest that it might be made is contained in my immediately succeeding telegram. Of the alterations made I comment moreparticularly on the following.3.   Paragraph No. 1.   I would omit words &quot; of the great major.&quot;4. Paragraph 2. I think it important to put in something by way of protecting uncertainty of the post-war position and have added words for thatpurpose. My own very strong instinct is because of the psychological value of doing so, to add a reference to our readiness so far as we were concerned to seeDominion Status attained within a year after the conclusion of the war. Asagainst that there is the argument that the period of achievement will, underthe procedure indicated in the rest of the declaration, not really depend on HisMajesty&apos;s Government at all but would be determined by the expedition of theproposed constitutional body unless of course that body were given a definitedate in which to report which is unthinkable. I have tried to meet point by an addition in paragraph 6 which I hope you will feel able to accept. I have nodoubt as to its importance.I am anxious to get away from the phrase &quot;constituent body,&quot; which issuspect to non-Congress elements in British India and equally to the States. Ihave replaced it where it occurs by a phrase which I think covers the pointsatisfactorily.5. Paragraph No. 3 (a), second sentence: For &quot;are willing&quot; substitute&quot;intend therefore,&quot; and for &quot;constitution,&quot; read &quot;the whole constitutional position should,&quot; &amp;c. (b) Third sentence : I do not much like surrendering withits suggestion of handing over under pressure, and would substitute &apos;&apos; the transferof.&quot; (c) Paragraph No. 3, last sentence. I am strongly averse from (? any)undertaking that we should ourselves &quot; forthwith &quot; go into this business. as you are now aware, there is no enthusiasm on the part of either Gandhi orJinnah for any exploratory process. My own very strong feeling is that it wouldbe a serious mistake to engage in or to offer one and I am only too conscious of the extreme practical difficulties of conducting one during time of war. Iwould prefer either to omit sentence or to re-word as in draft.6. Paragraph No. 5 (a), first sentence : I think it worth adding &quot; and tobring it into being without delay &apos;&apos; and I have substituted &quot; (? any) constitutionalscheme &quot; for &quot; any Indian constitution,&quot; so as to avoid any suggestion that wehave a single Dominion exclusively in view and are not prepared to discussJinnah&apos;s Pakistan scheme. (&amp;) In the third sentence I have put in the words :&quot; with their own consent,&quot; which will I think sufficiently protect States position.In the same sentence I have deleted the words &quot; recruited by the Secretary ofState.&quot; It has been pointed out to me that a declaration in these terms would naturally excite apprehension among members of Provincial Services, the existing members of which are entitled to protection in such matters as pay and pensions.Am I C? right) in thinking that you have deliberately omitted commercialdiscrimination %I think on the whole, though with some doubt, that we can probably takethe chance involved in not making an exhaustive enumeration but it would bedesirable in my view that you should bring out in the Debate that enumerationis not exhaustive, and that in particular important matter of British commercial interests remains to be cleared. I would certainly anticipate pressure in regardto it from Europeans, (c) Paragraph 5, fifth sentence : I would prefer to avoidsomewhat technical phrase &apos;&apos; instrument of agreement&apos;&apos; and to speak of a&quot; formal agreement.&quot;
7. Paragraph 6, third sentence : I am not very happy about &quot; representa-tives of the more important parties and communities.&quot; I would prefer (1) simply to say &quot; representative of Indians drawn from the political life of the country.&quot;The Executive Council would continue to be an official body though enlarged byaddition of non-official elements and though in practice I shall have to face upto the fact that particular individuals speak on behalf of Moslem League andI should prefer them not to be co-nominee representatives of Moslem League,Congress, &amp;c, but persons competent to represent the view of those bodies selected by you and me. It is arguable on a different point that the phrase &quot; moreimportant parties,&quot; &amp;c, might if used be held be (sic % to) debar me fromfill(ing) vacancies from less important parties who are willing to co-operate if,e.g., Congress and Moslem League stood out. An alternative possibility wouldbe to say &apos;&apos; persons capable of representing more imoortant interests in british india&quot;:But I do not favour that, for it opens door too widely and would expose usto claims for representation of labour, commerce, &amp;c, as also of bodies such asAnglo-Indians, Indian Christians, &amp;c. (2) I think we had better make it clearthat &quot;wider war council&quot; will meet at regular intervals as I have done inamended draft. Otherwise there may be expectation that it would be in permanent session, which is not of course our intention. I am anxious to avoid any exaggerated speculation which might be doomed to disappointment. (3) Fourthsentence. It is true your drafting of this sentence covers by words &quot; with general assent &quot; the position of Moslems, &amp;c, in the Provinces. But I feel that it willbe open to misconstruction, however unjustified, as it stands. I would prefer to use phraseology in my redraft. I do not strongly press inclusion of sentence&apos;&apos; should that hope desire &apos;&apos; but think it of value in view of detail in whichwe have been pressed by Jinnah over our intentions in the Provinces. (4) I haveexpanded paragraph 6. As indicated above, I attach importance to some referenceto a date.8. If you have any comments on amendment suggested I should be verygrateful if you would let me have them as early as possible. I correspondinglywill telegraph any further changes which I may make in the light of closerconsideration.(6)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 2, 1940.(Immediate.)No. 1279-S.   Draft declaration as amended.At this moment in the world&apos;s struggle against aggression and tyranny HisMajesty&apos;s Government feel assured that it is the earnest (? omission) of the peopleof India to throw themselves whole-heartedly and unitedly into the defence oftheir country and of the common cause. They believe this unity of nationalpurpose will be helped and some misunderstandings which have arisen in/recent months removed by a clear statement of their attitude to the steps to be taken towards the declared goal of British policy in India.2. It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government that India should attainat the earliest practicable moment after the war to her natural and rightfulposition as an equal partner-member in the British Commonwealth of Nations,enjoying to the full whatever status may be enjoyed by other Dominions afterthe war as free to control her own affairs and shape (? her) own destiny as theDominions.3. They recognise the right of India herself to frame the permanentstructure of the Constitution under which she is to regulate her own affairs.They intend therefore that immediately on the conclusion of the war the wholeconstitutional position should be examined anew in all its aspects, central and provincial, by whatever body, composed of Indians, may meantime be agreedupon for this purpose by representatives of the principal elements in India&apos;national life. Agreement is of the essence of the matter. His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment could not contemplate the transfer of their present responsibility for thepeace and welfare of India to any system of government whose authority is directly denied by underhand and powerful elements in India&apos;s national life; nor
could they be parties to coercion of such elements into submission to suchGovernment. They are convinced that agreement is possible, and that it is desired by the vast majority of the people of India. For their part they would,as they have always been, be most willing to lend any assistance in their power tobring the various parties together, and to overcome the difficulties which, to theirgreat regret, have stood in the way of progress in the past.4. Agreement again is of essence of the matter in regard to composition ofthe body of Indian representatives mentioned above, the method of selecting its members, and the machinery by which it will arrive at its conclusion.5. Given the necessary measure of agreement, His Majesty ^Governmentare prepared to accept without delay as the permanent structure of new Indiapolicy any constitutional scheme that may be adopted by body of Indian repre-sentatives already mentioned, and to bring it into being without delay. Thispermanent structure will not necessarily of itself make provision for existingresponsibilities and obligations which Great Britain&apos;s long connection hasimposed upon her, or for the necessity for that close co-operation in regard to defence and foreign policy the necessity for which will subsist until India, is ableto meet unaided her needs in this field. The principal obligations here referredto, besides &apos;those relating to Indians defence, concern the fulfilment of obligations to Indian States in so far as they are not completely incorporated with their ownconsent in the hew Indian polity, and the securing of the reasonable rights of&quot;the existing members of the Services.it is &apos;the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that arrangements for thedischarge of these obligations and provision for that close co-operation in regardto defence and foreign policy they have just referred to can most appropriately be embodied in a formal agreement as between His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe proposed body of representatives of India acting on behalf of the new government of India. The agreement in question would be for a stated periodof years. It would be renewable by negotiation in so far as circumstances might require, and it would for its duration be embodied in the Indian Constitution asan integral part of that Constitution, and would enter into force concurrently with it.6. It is obvious that no such fundamental reconsideration of existingIndian Constitution can take place in midst of a great war. But within the framework of that Constitution His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to enlist the full and active co-operation of all parties and elements in the political life ofIndia. In pursuance of that object, His Excellency the Governor-General hasbeen authorised to invite representative Indians drawn from the public life ofthe country to join his Executive Council, as well as to associate with them in a wider War Council which would meet, at regular intervals, representatives of theIndian States and of other interests in the national life of India .&apos;a&apos;s a whole.They trust in the grave circumstances of to-day the general will of all parties toco-operate for war effort may lead to such ;a measure of common agreement dnthe provinces as may make possible at an early date the resumption withigeneralassent of Parliamentary Government in those provinces which - are now beingdirectly administered under Emergency Provisions of Government Act. &quot;should that hope be disappointed, they will consider, after expansion of Central Govern-ment has taken place, what further contribution they can make to bringing abouta state of things which they so earnestly (corrupt group).7. These proposals have in view f ramingby Indians themselves immediately on the conclusion of the war !of the permanent -structure &apos;tif India&apos;s -future constitution, ^othing would give greater ipleasure Ho &apos;His i&quot;Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment than that wbrk should be so expedited and necessary agreement-reached;asto making India&apos;s achievement of her fullest stature possible within a year of&apos;theconclusion of the war. They hope and believe- (?that) in the manner they have indicated India will be able, even within the limits of the present Constitution,to make er influence felt, to play a great and significant part in the conduct&apos;ofthe war, and to prepare herself for the tasks of (? omission) and freedom ofnational life which lies before her.
Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor-General, dated July 8, 1940.(Important.)3645. Your telegrams dated July 8 1278 and 1279: I am most grateful for your suggestions. I send you in my immediately succeeding telegram revisedtext which I am circulating to the Cabinet in substitution for the original. as you will see I have met in it most of your points, though not always exactly in wordsyou suggested. On one or two points I have thought it best to retain my original draft. As regards the two changes you propose in paragraph 2, I attach greatimportance to making explicit the parity of United Kingdom with Dominionswhich is implicit in &quot;Dominion Status,&quot; and I very much doubt whether anydisquiet which may be produced in Afghanistan by general drift of statement would be increased or diminished by presence or absence of words &quot;UnitedKingdom and.&quot;2. I have omitted your insertion in same paragraph intended to safeguardpossible changes in position of Dominions after the war as being likely to giverise to great speculation and misgiving, and I am sure Dominions Office wOuldshare my view. Such a phrase would suggest the possibility either thatDominions have not yet reached the full stage of independence open to them, or alternatively that His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate taking from Dominionssomething of position they have gained.3. I also attach importance to the use of the expression &quot; constituent body.&quot;This is not identical with Congress &apos;&apos; Constituent Assembly,&quot; whereas a studiedavoidance of the word &apos;&apos; constituent&apos;&apos; would, I am sure, create more trouble withthe Congress than it would avoid with other parties. Moreover, in the nearfuture some short label for this body will be essential and no other label soobviously appropriate is available.4. As you do not press strongly for the concluding sentence of your redraftof paragraph 6, and I should much prefer to omit it, I have done so.(8)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 8, 1940.(Immediate.)1292-S. My telegram dated 7th July, No. 1278-S. Having further considered draft declaration, I have no supplementary suggestions to make onits wording. My telegram No. 1187- S of 1st July will fully have shown myattitude on the question generally, though since its date we have, of course, hadJinnah&apos;s memorandum of 1st July and. Congress Resolution of 6th July (which1 am repeating separately), both of which suggest possibility of greater difficultythan at one time seemed likely. For all that, I remain of opinion that there isdefinite advantage in a declaration; and though I am not optimistic as to chances of Congress at all modifying their view save in return for acceptance of their full terms, I am certain that a declaration on the broad lines which I used with gandhi and which are embodied in declaration (? now) under consideration should go some way to (? make) clear to the World our (% position) and to rallyingmoderate support. Possibility that for their own tactical reasons neitherCongress nor Moslem League might be prepared to play is already fully present to you; but I should be quite prepared even in that event to go ahead vyith theexpansion of my Council, selecting the best non-official political materialavailable; and with the appointment of a War Council.2. As regards date of announcement I am anxious to let Kalam Azad,Jinnah and President of the Mahasabha have advance copies for strictly confidential information to reach them a day before the announcement.My covering letter would express the hope that their organisation would be willing to co-operate, and would invite them to come to see me on the subject.I will also send a copy to Gandhi. I contemplate a very short broadcast by wayof send-off to statement and (^corrupt group) for response to it on night before ft* (Will be glad)       (accordingly)       (at the same time).
appears in press. What are your views as regards actual arrangements forannouncement ? It is, I think, important that as you have proposed, declaration should appear here in the first place; but I realise that you will wish Parliamentto have it almost, if not quite, simultaneously. I am inclined to suggest thatsimplest thing would be that I should arrange for publication in Indian morningpapers on 16th, Tuesday (or if you prefer 15th, Monday); and that we should use censorship to prevent any repetition home of declaration or comment on it until you are able to announce its terms in Parliament the same afternoon.3.   I think correspondence that has passed between us has put you fully inpossession of my views on the various matters in issue save as to position of commander-in-Chief in relation to any expanded Council.  After consultation I,like you, am much attracted in principle as my telegram No. 1187-S of 1st Julywill have shown, by the idea of an Indian Defence Minister, and it would be ofgreat value to know what the reaction of the Cabinet to the general propositionis.  Position has also been to some extent compromised by arrangements approved in respect of Burma.   On the other hand, I cannot help feeling that there is agreat deal to be said for keeping Commander-in-Chief in Council in war time,and I am a little doubtful as to whether it would be possible to combine in my council the Commander-in-Chief and a Minister of Defence.   Nor do I thinkthat appointment of Counsellor (leaving Commander-in-Chief in Council) is really the solution.  Position of Counsellor, who is not a Member of my Council,would be so definitely inferior to that either of Commander-in-Chief or of otherMembers of Council as to enable him to carry little weight and make his appoint-ment of little political value.   (I have always contemplated that Counsellor(? under) Federation would correspond to Secretary of State for War and would run the Defence Department, the Chief running the General Staff side, andprobably put up proposals affecting policy through Counsellor.  But that position could hardly be carried out (it would certainly be quite unacceptable to presentChief) were Counsellor to be of lower standing than a Member of my council or excluded from the Council, and I should anticipate considerable friction ifhe and the Chief were both Members.)  I am taking certain further (? soundings)here; but for the moment am disposed to think that wiser course may be to leavethings as they are, despite the attractions and psychological value of a defence minister, though you should not take me as finally committed to that view as yet.Line I have been taking in relation to the Burma announcement is that hithertoin Burma there has been no link between the Cabinet and Defence (as repre-sented by 1 G.O.C.) save through the Governor; that in India the Chief (aliasDefence Member) is in the Cabinet (i.e., my Council), so,that any member of my council, whether official or non-official, is in immediate touch with Memberresponsible for defence.   This, I need not say, does not meet racial urge, but itis, of course, a most material point and this presentation of the case does, in fact,expose the true constitutional position.   Meantime, as I have already said, itwould be of great assistance to know the provisional reaction of the Cabinet tothe idea of a non-official Indian Defence Minister.4. I will telegraph separately as regards possible composition of a WarCouncil and as regards detail of any expansion of my own Executive Council.I provisionally contemplate going down to Delhi, more or less simultaneously withthe issue of the declaration, to facilitate conversations with party leaders, &amp;c.(9)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated July 9, 1940(Immediate.)1316-S. Your telegram No. 3645 of 8th July. Many thanks. I am very glad in particular that you agree as to importance of some reference to dateof Dominion Status.2. I accept your view as regards reference to United Kingdom in para-graph 2. You are aware of possible misinterpretation which may result, but Ido not press it. I accept also omission referred to in paragraph No. 2 of yourNo. 3645 and drafting amendment referred to in your paragraph No. 4. Whilequite appreciating your feeling, I do, however, strongly press that words&apos;&apos; constituent body &apos;&apos; where it occurs should be replaced by the alternative phrase
I have suggested. I do not regard probability of getting Congress in as great, andI am quite certain that use or otherwise of words &quot; constituent body &quot; in this declaration will not turn the scale. On the other hand, it will certainly offendboth Princes and Moslems, and I attach much more importance, at a time when we are regarded as paying undue attention to a wholly non-co-operative Congress,to encouraging those who are likely to come in than to going out of our way tomeet those who are not. My Advisers share this view. What really matters inthis business is the (? reaction) here, rather than the reaction at Home, and in face of that I attach definite importance to the retention of my form of words.Decision must be for His Majesty&apos;s Government, but point is one which I regard as material, and if you feel unable yourself to meet me over it, I should like my views mentioned to the Cabinet.3. We have to be particularly careful about the States (I am clear of thatin the light of my talks with the Jam Sahib, who has just been here). I cannotconsult Glancy until to-morrow, but I would likely (? like) to be sure that he regards amended wording now suggested in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraphNo. 5 (&quot; join in and become part &quot;) (? as) (? adequate) so far as they are concerned,though I hope that he will think that your phrase sufficiently meets the case.4. I should prefer my own rewording of the opening sentence of sub (?paragraph omitted) 2 of paragraph No. 5. I doubt if one can speak of fulfillingneeds, &amp;c. I would also still urge that we should speak of &quot; a formal agreement &quot;and not of &apos;&apos; an instrument of agreement&apos;&apos; in the same sub-paragraph.5. I assume in the light of your telegram that the omission of any referenceto commercial discrimination is deliberate, and have no further comment to makeabout that.(10)Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated July 12, 1940.(Immediate.)925. Private and personal. Cabinet have accepted your proposals as regardsExecutive Council and War Advisory Committee, but doubtful about anyaccompanying declaration. They are, howrever, willing that I should submitamended draft, and if this is approved it will be telegraphed out for you toconsider whether it would be helpful to you in creating right atmosphere forlaunching your invitations. Main change I am suggesting is transposition,which places paragraph 5 before paragraph 3, thus emphasising insistence onour obligations and beginning new paragraph 4 by words &quot; subject to suitableprovision being made for these needs and responsibilities.&quot; Regret delayinvolved, but hope it will be only two or three days.(11)Telegram from Viceroy, dated Jidy 13, 1940.1351-S. Private and Personal. Your private and personal telegram12th July. I am glad that Cabinet agree as regards expansion of my ExecutiveCouncil and War Advisory Council.2. As regards declaration, I had assumed you had taken prior soundingsof Cabinet. I should be grateful if text of declaration as proposed to be amended could be telegraphed to me before it is submitted to Cabinet. It cannotbe assumed I shall be prepared to concur in it without having previouslyconsidered it, in its amended form (I had already in view certain further changes of wording in original draft). There need, however, be no delay in dealing with it here. It is, on the other hand, important, if there is to be a declaration at all(and I myself continue to favour one in the light of views of governors), thatthere should be as little delay as possible in reaching a decision, more particularly as I have to give notice to political leaders concerned. I should like to emphasiseagain that essential thing about any declaration of this type is impression itproduces here. It would, in my judgment, be very definitely preferable that[21565] c
first draft of such declarations should in future be prepared by Governor-Generaland amended as you may think fit by you or by His Majesty&apos;s Government.There is great risk (as I have pointed out to you in connection with (? use) of words such as &quot;Constituent body,&quot; &amp;c.) of drafts prepared in quite a differentatmosphere having results which are definitely most undesirable in indian political field, and in justice to myself I think it is quite essential that cabinet should realise my feeling about that. I assume that you have laid before themmy telegrams of 30th June, No. 1178-S, and 1st July, No. 1187-S, and that theyare in possession of my views as set out in those telegrams.(12)Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor-General, dated July 13, 1940.933. Private and personal. Laithwaite from Clauson. With referenceto Governor-Generals private and personal telegram, dated 13th July, 1351-S,which Secretary of State will be answering, you may like to know differences between statement as revised on Cabinet instructions and circulated for considera-tion next week and original statement sent with Secretary of State&apos;s telegram3646, dated 9th July.Paragraph 1. No change.Paragraph 2. Omit &quot;as&quot; before &quot;free&quot; and omit &quot;as the UnitedKingdom or the Dominions.&quot;Paragraphs 3 and 4 are as follows : Begins : 3. The long connection of Great Britain with India has, however, imposed on His Majesty&apos;s Government responsibilities and obligations for which they are bound to make provision and has created an intimate co-operation in regard to defence and foreign policy the necessity for which will subsist until India is ableto meet unaided her needs in this field. The principal obligations here referred to,besides those relating to defence, concern the fulfilment of obligations to the indian states to the extent that they do not join in and become part of the future schemeof Indian self-government, and the securing of the reasonable rights of theexisting members of the Public Services.4. Subject, therefore, to suitable provision being made for meeting theseneeds and responsibilities. His Majesty&apos;s Government are willing that thepermanent structure of future Indian self-government should be determined by indians for themselves, and they intend that immediately on the conclusion ofhostilities the whole position should be examined anew in all its aspects, central and provincial, by whatever constitutional convention may meantime be agreedupon for this purpose by representatives of the principal elements in India&apos;national life.  Ends.Paragraph 5 : Begins: &quot; If the permanent structure of the Constitution isto be devised &quot; and then continues as in previous paragraph 4 with substitution of &quot;constitutional convention&quot; for &quot;constituent body.&quot;Paragraph 6 is same as second sub-paragraph of previous paragraph 5 withfollowing alterations: &quot;the needs and obligations referred to above&quot; issubstituted for &quot;these obligations and needs,&quot; &quot;met&quot; is substituted for&quot; fulfilled &quot; and &quot; convention &quot; for &quot; constituent body.&quot;Paragraphs 7 and 8 are previous paragraph 6 without change.(13)Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated july 14, 1940.936. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram of13th July, 1351-S. I had in fact taken preliminary soundings which encouragedme to believe that Cabinet would approve declaration, but Halifax was unavoidable-ably absent and other members proved less forthcoming than I had been led to hope.
I made it clear to Cabinet that text was my draft incorporating amendments suggested by you and not vice versa. I hope you did not think that I intendedto limit you in any way as regards scope of criticisms I invited you to make. I realise the all-importance of impression likely to be produced in India; thus youwill see from my No. 933 of yesterday that I have deferred to your objectionto use of term &quot; constituent body.&quot; If you have any further suggestions I shallbe very glad to have them, and Cabinet will certainly wish to be assured thatif you recommend in favour of a declaration the actual text has your fullconcurrence. Revised draft will be taken in Cabinet on Tuesday morning,16th July, and if they accept it with or without amendment you will then be askedwhether you favour issue of such a statement. This will leave you free to propose any further alterations which you then might consider essential. Meanwhileplease let me know if you still have doubts on any points in the draft now before you-      - -  &apos; i -Assumption in your Jast sentence is correct.(14)Telegram- from Governor-General to Secretary of State for India, dated july 15, 1940.(Immediate.)1376-S. Personal. Clauson&apos;s private and personal telegram of 14th July,No. 933, and your private and personal telegram of 14th July, No. 936.Declaration.(a) I concur in amendments embodied in your No. 933, all of which are, Ithink, improvements.(&amp;) I suggest following quite minor amendments:  (i) New paragraph 5, last sentence. For &apos;&apos; to enable .... into force(? &quot;substitute) &quot;to enable India&apos;s new self-governing constitution,devised by Indians themselves, to ... . into force.&quot;(ii) Paragraph 7 in declaration as issued here, since I will take full responsibility for it, and make it mine, I propose to amend second sentence by substituting for words : &quot; His Excellency the Governor-General &quot; the words: &quot;I, as Governor-General, have, &amp;c.,&quot; withnecessary consequential verbal alterations.(c) Unless the considered opinion of the Cabinet is against, I would be disposed to mention &apos;&apos; commercial interests &apos;&apos; in new paragraph 3. I feel little doubt that Europeans will attach importance to point, and it is one whichCongress have always regarded as a subject for special treatment. I would use the phrase &quot; commercial interests &quot; or &quot; legitimate commercial interests &quot; ratherthan &quot;commercial discrimination.&quot;2. It would be of great assistance if you could let me know as early aspossible whether the Cabinet approve declaration as now amended, as I should like to get copies off to Presidents of Congress, Moslem League and Mahasababy the morning of Thursday and it may take three days to reach Jinnah orSavarkar.3. Implications of this declaration in its present form are very wide indeed.I suggest for your consideration that, whether here or at home, we should do well,when it issues, to stand strictly on its terms, saying that it is self-explanatoryand avoid entering into any refinements or explanations. Otherwise we shall find ourselves involved in a series of arguments as to what is to happen in certainhypotheses, e.g., if and when we propose to close down service recruitment, &amp;c.I will instruct my officials here in that sense if you agree.[21565]
(15)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated July 15, 1940.5-U.Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram dated 14th July,936. I am replying separately that I concur in the declaration subject to oneor two minor further verbal amendments and that I am strongly in favour ofthe declaration as part of the decision to expand my Council and establish awar advisory council in the light of your telegram under reply, for which I amgrateful. I think, however, in fairness to you and to myself, that I should makemy position clear in this matter.2. Declaration I recommended (paragraph 6 of my telegram of the1st instant, 1187-S) was one which went as far as, or (? short) of, my declaration to Gandhi. That was as far as I thought it wise to go; and I contemplateddrafting it myself if the Cabinet agreed to my going so far. In reply, I received in your telegram 3507 a declaration in character and emphasis very different from what I had in view. I would have suggested an alternative of my own hadI not assumed from the categorical form of the draft and insistence with whichit was pressed (even in the matter of verbal alterations I have had difficulty in persuading you to drop the references to the United Kingdom and the Dominions,Constituent Assembly, &amp;c.) that it was based on informal soundings of theCabinet, Avho, for reasons of their own, were (corrupt group) that we shouldhandle the matter in this way, and that it represented a line they were anxiousto adopt.3. I now find with embarrassment that that is not the case; that declarationso arbitrarily urged upon me had not any previous backing from Cabinet either in principle or in form; indeed, that whole question whether there is to be adeclaration or not is left open. I need not emphasise difficulty position createsfor me, or extent to which I feel I am entitled to complain about the manner inwhich this issue has been handled. For good or for bad, however, we must now,I am certain, go ahead with declaration in its present form. Flave consultedGovernors about one. My officials here are aware of drafts that have passed between us, and without still greater embarrassment there can be no withdrawing from position taken up. Nor do I wish to recast the declaration (subject to the drafting alterations which I have suggested or am suggesting). That would beimpossible at this stage. ? The urgent thing is to get on with the communication to politicals. But I must repeat that this confirms me in my view that in future a declaration or statement of this character should come from here. Had drafting of present declaration been left to me, I would have prepared draft for your consideration and that of His Majesty&apos;s Government, which would have goneias far as I had in my conversation with Gandhi, and which would have been(corrupt group) in emphasis and in character. The essential thing, as I am sureyou agree, in a statement of this type is the impression produced (corrupt group),and I am certain that that being so, drafting should in future be left to Governor-General, although Secretary of State and Cabinet can, of course, deal with any proposals, or drafts, from him as they think fit.4. You will not, I am sure, misunderstand me if I add, in most friendlyspirit, that since you have been in office you have been most helpful to me outsideconstitutional field. In constitutional field, however, I have been subjected toinsistent pressure, to which I take strong exception, to put forward proposalswhich go further than in my judgment, based on extensive experience of this problem and the personalities concerned, it would be wise for me to advise HisMajesty&apos;s Government to go. I have been at pains to give you my consideredadvice in objective telegrams. In reply, I have received, whether in your privateletters or by telegram, detailed suggestions, in many cases in my view based oninsufficient familiarity with the position here, that I should take a (omission)(compare your telegram of the 16th ultimo, No. 754). I cannot but take exceptionalso to tone of certain telegrams. e.g., your telegram of the 16th ultimo. Theonly basis on which Viceroy and Secretary of State can handle this delicate andmost important issue is one of complete collaboration and friendly exchange of views. There can be no question of dictation from one or the other. But youwill appreciate that when I receive very strongly urged suggestions from you in face of advice from me that a different line should be adopted, I am unable to
-judge whether these suggestions represent Cabinet policy based on factors not present to me, or your assessment of the insignificance( ?) taken (corrupt group)you alone are in a position to judge of what Cabinet are anxious that I should,consistently with my own judgment, recommend to them.5. My position is, if you will allow me to make it clear, this : that HisMajesty&apos;s Government can, as in time of the late Government, rely upon me tokeep Secretary of State, and through him the Cabinet, in closest possible touchwith all developments; to tender completely objective and detached advice in lightof my own experience of this problem, which is one the local handling of, and responsibility for, which falls upon me; that you may be quite confident that ifI think (corrupt group) time has arrived to advise that we should go ahead, orto emphasise a particular aspect of the problem, or to urge a particular method of handling it, I shall so advise them (the record of my handling of Indianconstitutional issues up to now is sufficient guarantee of that); and equally thatI can be relied on to give the most careful consideration to any suggestions from home, and to accept them if I think the case for them good. I would prefer,however, that such suggestions should be put to me (and they will always havethe fullest and most sympathetic reception) less in nature of instructions (fromwhich your telegram of the 16th ultimo is not far removed) than as something onwhich my view and my advice are desired. It would be of assistance to me alsoif in cases in which Cabinet are not in the picture, or in which you are merelyasking for my view, without knowledge of their probable reaction, I could be so informed.   That would assist me in formulating my comments.6. As regards the ueclaration, while my views are as set out above, I am prepared to make myself entirely responsible for it, and regard it, indeed, as important that I should do so. There can be no question of a division of view between Secretary of State and Viceroy in a matter like this; and there oughtto be no suggestion that a particular declaration had been drafted at home and pressed upon Viceroy against his own judgment. For that reason I propose inissuing it here to preface it with a brief broadcast to make it clear it is based on my recommendations to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that I appeal for goodwillfor it; and I am suggesting separately to you verbal alteration in new para-graph 7 which will associate me with it in a more personal way. We cannotof course redraft it. As stated above (corrupt group) fact that there is a draftof this nature is known to a number of persons. Apart from that, further delaywhich I regard as most undesirable would be involved.7. I have spoken my mind very plainly indeed in this telegram, but I am sure you will not misunderstand my doing so. Though I may have put mattersrather bluntly, my telegram is intended in most friendly spirit, and its object is essentially to remove misunderstandings, and to eliminate possible sources ofirritations, for future. You can, as you know, rely on my fullest sympathy and support in your anxiety to get ahead. It cannot be greater than mine, though may be more conscious of practical difficulties, and you need not fear that I shallnot at all times be most ready to collaborate, in friendliest and most co-operativespirit, and to give the best advice and fullest help that I possibly can.(16)Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated July 16, 1940.4-TJ.Private and personal. Your 5-U. I am genuinely distressed to think thatthere should have been so serious a misunderstanding between us which I confessI never suspected. I had, indeed, freely aired my views to you by way of thinkingaloud in earlier letters and telegrams and in my telegram 754 of 17th June,abandoning my suggestions for a study group which you deprecated, did urgeyou strongly to reconsider your position on the basis of a revised plan that Ioutlined. But I certainly did not intend that telegram to be more than a strongplea and I was quite prepared to hear from you that the revised plan also was open to objections from your point of view. You replied on 20th June without going into details that you were still unconvinced, but were inviting Gandhi andJinnah to see you.  Replying next day, while expressing my doubts whether you
would make much progress with Gandhi without some assurances as to the future,I left the matter to your own judgment, only asking you not to close the door tothe procedure I had suggested.I admit that I was pleased, though also a little surprised, when I receivedyour account of your talk with Gandhi, in which you put forward to himsuggestions as to a declaration which seemed to me to go as far in substance asanything which I had suggested. I assumed that in the interval the developmentof the situation had persuaded you of the desirability of such a declaration, and expressed to you in reply my satisfaction that our minds were now so closely in accord.In thereupon drafting a declaration for your consideration I had no idea that my draft was essentially different in substance from what you put to Gandhi,though I now see that the original arrangement, since transposed, somewhataltered the emphasis. Your suggested amendments never led me to suspect thatthe declaration as a whole w^ent beyond what you thought desirable and I should,of course, have gladly considered any alternative draft which you might have putforward.As regards the Cabinet position, I had good reason to believe that the membersof the War Cabinet were in favour of the proposed declaration, apart from thePrime Minister, and you could only realise if you were here how difficult it hasbeen to get a word in with him on any subject outside urgent war decisions. ButI was not I confess prepared for the vigour with which, reinforced by Lloyd, hereasserted all the old arguments of pre-1935 against airy advance and can only hope that he may be induced by his colleagues to give way at the next meetingwhose postponement I regret as much as you do.I realise fully the embarrassing position into which possible rejection ofthe declaration by Cabinet may put both of us and should, indeed, be sorry ifyou felt that it has been my handling of the matter that has been at fault. Inany case do let me assure you that the last thing I have even thought of isarbitrarily forcing my views upon you. I am sure you will agree that it isessential to our co-operation that we should each express our views to the otherwith the most complete frankness, but that does not mean that I should wish to override your judgment. I am only too anxious to work in complete unity of purpose and policy with.you and to help you in the heavy responsibilities which you have to face.Since writing the above, I have seen the Prime Minister&apos;s private and personal message to you. You can judge best how to help the situation in yourreply to him.(17)Telegram from Viceroy, dated July 18, 1940.6-U.Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram dated 16th July,5-U. I, of course, fully accept your explanation. It is quite clear you cannot have appreciated the impression likely to be produced by the telegrams, &amp;c,which I have received from you, or importance from the Viceroy&apos;s point of viewof being aware of the position and the attitude of the Cabinet towardssuggestions such as those put to me. The Viceroy clearly must always beprepared to (corrupt group) seriously suggestions strongly urged by the Secretaryof State, for assumption must be that (unless contrary is made clear) suchsuggestions represent the Secretary of State&apos;s assessment of the mind of theCabinet, or what they are prepared to accept. I feel sure, too, that you will agreethat he is entitled, e.g., before an interview such as I had with Gandhi, and after certain courses of action had been so strongly urged on him, to be aware of any possible difficulty with the Cabinet or of any reluctance on their part to go so faras I had already been pressed to go.2. I on my side am equally to blame for allowing any doubt to exist asregards the true position as between you and the Cabinet, and for notascertaining from you at once the precise nature of the background of sugges-tions put to me (I regret now that I did not send you the reply I had preparedto your telegram dated 16th June, and which in fact I withheld as feeling that
it was too critical of both the content of that telegram and of ,unfortunate incident however, may now be regarded as closed and I feel certainthat in the light of it you and I can look to working on the friendWndco-operative basis which we are anxious to see maintained in future SdwhilpI cannot in justice to myself leave the Prime Minister inSATfttelegrams that passed between us in the mHW nn,t *e V    ^^orance ot theagree that ray rlply to him handtoThafmaSe&apos; ^1 have beZanxfoTtHnThiway least calculated to cause you embarrassment. anxious to, m the(18)Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated Jidy 18, 1940.6-U.Private and personal. I think it may be opportune with reference to your 1414-S if, without attempting in any way to prejudge your reply to PrimeMinister, I gave you my impression of how he may be likely to react if you refer to the personal telegrams which passed between us. If you intend to reply thatyou definitely consider a declaration necessary (whether in its present form or with further amendments, or perhaps even an alternative draft), the effect ofshowing him these telegrams would, I feel sure, lead him in his present mood to argue that you had acted throughout under pressure from the India Office andthereupon to make this an effective plea for discounting your present advice, andI cannot feel hopeful that rest of Cabinet would in that case stand up to him.In that event declaration would be killed, however earnestly you may recommend it. If, however, you intend to reply on other lines, the above considerations donot arise.2. As regards the personal telegrams, I admit I was not aware of correspondence with Zetland to which you refer; but these telegrams are certainlysuch as to admit of the treatment you mention.(19)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated July 19, 1940.8-TJ.Your telegram 18th instant, 6-U, crossed my replies to you and to PrimeMinister. I greatly regret that I do not see how I could avoid Prime Ministerseeing these telegrams, which are of vital importance. I can only hope that my telegram to him will convince him and Cabinet of case for a statement onmodified lines I recommend, for I regard some statement as of real importance ifI am to announce any expansion. There is nothing now for it but to awaitoutcome of Cabinet discussion. I greatly regret any misunderstanding aboutmarking of these telegrams, but may be sure (sic) (? you omitted) will agree that(the correspondence with Zetland apart) telegrams such as yours of the 16th June(whether 754 Personal or 753 Private and Personal) could hardly be regardedas mere (% expressions of personal opinion not designed to influence my courseof action or decisions.(20Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated July 23, 1940.10-U.Private and personal. My private and personal telegram No. 988 of to-day.Will do my very best to secure Cabinet acceptance for your draft statement. I fearI never realised that you would have preferred longer form of statement to shorterand more categorical declaration and am perfectly content with your version.
