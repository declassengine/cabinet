Minister without Portfolioas ^G^^d^rrxr^n^c^^^^ .lb At its 8th Meeting on 25th July, 1940,. the production council had before it an extract from the conclusions of aMeeting of the Defence Committee (Supply) inviting them&quot;to consider the inclusion in Priority. 1(a) of the manufactureof tanks and to report to the Prime Minister the effect on aircraft production of so doing&quot;o      It was noted that thePrime Minister as Minister of Defence had decided that it was of the greatest strategical importance to carry out the newtank programme approved by the Defence Committee (Supply) bythe date laid down,,2o The Council^  therefore, after discussion agreed inprinciple that tanks should be added to the articles specifiedin paragraph 1(a) of the General Priority Direction, but thatno amending direction should be issued pending a reportconcerning the effect of the new proposal on other Serviceprogramme so3o At the 9th Meeting of the Production Council on 5th AugustColonel Llewellin reported that there would be a conflict   -between the requirements of tank and aircraft production inalloy steel and drop forgings^      It was reported-that steps were being taken to increase the production of drop forgings.The Council (the fspresentative of the Ministry of aircraft production dissenoing) agreed that tanks should continue to beincluded In the 1(a) Priority List, noted that action had beentaken to improve the supplies of drop forgings, and asked me tofurnish an interim report to the Prime Minister on the matter,which I did04. The Memorandum (WoP0 (40) 313) &quot;by the Minister of   .Aircraft Production on the question of Priority for tank production is naturally concerned, not so much with the merits of the case for proceeding effectively and expeditiously withthe provision of adequate supplies of tanks for the Army, aswith securing the utmost advantage in his struggle to obtainmaximum production of aircraft and other essential needs ofthe Royal Air Force.      No one can possibly dissent from his general objective or fail to recognise that nothing should standin the way of remedying the deficiencies to which, he refers.

5o It is however impossible to conduct the war on thebasis of unlimited priority for one  type of production alone.If our resources were unlimited,  the position would be different,,      But they are not;    and unless provision is madeto ensure the maintenance of production of other urgent rquirements, we shall be in grave danger of being unableto take advantage of the results of our great success in theair struggle,60 The priority decisions now operating were taken duringMay55 when the main consideration was to concentrate on the short-term necessities of the new situation which had thenarisen,,      Even on that basis, it was not conceded that a 1blanket priority to the Air Programme would meet our needs;and. provision was made for an equal concentration of effort on anti-aircraft defence and on small arms and smallarm ammunition.     Further, it was recognised that special measures for the prompt replacement of the losses suffered by the Army in Flanders must be facilitated and that in making these efforts of first urgency the other vital needs of theeervicea should be safeguarded,7c. The priority decisions which the Minister of aircraft Production wishes to preserve were in fact carefullyformulated and laid down to meet these requirements,.      Theywere not, as his Memorandum implies, either in intention orin terms, a decision to sacrifice all other forma ofwar effort to the Air Programme.80 They were moreover clearly taken as decisions to govern the direction of our efforts on a short term basisonly.      They did not preclude the possibility of revision oramendment and indeed, in the form in which they were put intoapplication, definitely foreshadowed an early review.It was in the nature of such a review, that the DefenceCommittee (Supply) of the War Cabinet invited theProduction Council to consider the extension to the TankProgramme of the priority now at issue.      The importanceof this programme has been held to justify, not priority over the immediate pressing needs of the Royal Air Force,but that it should proceed, side by side with theProgramme, with the utmost expedition that our resources,properly pooled and administered, will permit.A copy of the current Priority of ProductionDirection is annexed to this Memorandum:the relevant War Cabinet decision is containedin W.Mo(40) 116th Conclusions, Minute 1Q

9 % 1&amp; &apos; 9* The situation in regard to the supply of t anks was fully disclosed to the Defence Committee (Supply) at thetime when its decision was reached.    Without the advantage which the Air Programme has had during the past threemonths, the Tank Programme presents many of the same typeof problems as are referred to in the Minister&apos;sMemorandum.    There are the same difficulties in regard tolosses to be made good (a);    the same demands to meetexpansions;    the same demands for overseas;    and the sameshortage of spares for necessary repairs and maintenance,There is, moreover, the same unfortunate conclusion that &apos;a failure to safeguard current production must lead toa curtailment of our strength in the field.10.       The conclusion, which was reached at the recent meeting of the Production Council (the representative ofthe Ministry of Aircraft Production alone dissenting) isthat however imperative is the need for maximum productionof aircraft, it is both necessary and practicable tosecure that this should proceed on a basis which at leastdoes not prevent other essential provision from proceeding at the same time.    It is with this object in view that theProduction Council accepted the new proposals for thegeneral application of priorities by means of reversion to   the system of orderly allocations of materials and capacity.36   By this system it is held that programmes,adequately adjusted in themselves according to the operative priority decisions of the day, may be permitted to proceed and not to be held up or stopped, as is rapidlybecoming an imminent possibility, if the full claims inthe Minister&apos;s Memorandum are conceded.11.       It is -understood that the Minister of aircraft production has himself taken steps to secure that thefull advantage of the priority for aircraft productionshall be severely restricted to services which are reallyvital.    It is agreed that a similar severity should beapplied in the use of other priorities.A12,       As regards his other criticisms of measures forwhich the Ministry of Supply is responsible,  it isnecessary to point out that it is only in recent weeks thatany programme of requirements of drop stampings has been tabled in respect of the Air Programme.(Intd.)
