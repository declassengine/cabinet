(^0) 29i&apos;bly 30, 1940.TO BE  KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.INDIA.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues a telegram which Isent to the Viceroy on the 28th July, 1940, and the Viceroy&apos;s reply of the30th July, 1940, about the draft Statement.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,Jidy 30, 1940.[21569]
Telegram from Prime Minister to Viceroy, dated July 28, 1940.I WAS very glad to get your telegram, and I am sorry that intense pressure of business prevented me from entering into direct relations with you earlier.2. Difficulties of draft statement dated the 24th July*begin at paragraph cabinet would not be able to promise in advance &quot; to accept as a body to frameon the conclusion of the war, the main structure of the Constitution, any body on which the representatives of the principal elements in India&apos;s national lifecan meantime themselves agree.&quot; We should have to know beforehand what this body was, and feel assured that it truly represented the broad masses of theleading Indian communities, including, of course, not only Hindus and Moslemsbut the Princes, the Depressed Classes, the Sikhs, the Anglo-Indians and others3. It would further be quite impossible to pledge in advance the attitudeof a future Parliament called into being in the unforeseeable conditions whichwill follow the war. Parliament must remain free to use its judgment and authority on the problems of that future day in the light of then existingcircumstances. It would only be misleading our Indian friends if we led themto believe that we had any power under our free democratic system to prescribein advance the composition or temper of a future House of Commons, or that theywould be likely to &quot; accept as they stood &quot; whatever was set before them.4. Objection was also taken by some of my colleagues to the fixing of aparticular date for the achievement of Dominion Status. We are all agreed asto the earnestness of the effort to lead India forward on that path, and that nodilatory tactics should be tolerated. But that is quite different from fixing a date, or a twelve-months&apos; time limit, for the accomplishment of so vast a task.5. The Cabinet, therefore, at their meeting on the 25th July reached thefollowing conclusions, which I take from the record : (1) Reaffirmed their decision approving the expansion of the Viceroy&apos; executive Council and the setting- up of a War Advisory Committee.(2) Agreed that an announcement of these two measures should be accompanied by a further Declaration.(3) Invited the Prime Minister to draft, for consideration by the WarCabinet, a Declaration on the lines indicated by him in discussion,which should involve no departure in principle from the declaration made on the 23rd May.6. Pursuant to the above, I have ventured to recast for your considerationparagraphs 7 and 8, and I shall await your comments before bringing theappended alternative before the Cabinet.******(The text of the new paragraph 7, circulated as W.P. (40) 295, was annexed to this telegram.)
1 &amp; o10. Downing Street, S.W. 1,Jidy 30, 1940.Telegram from Viceroy to Prime Minister, dated Jidy 30, 1940.I AM most grateful for your telegram of 28th July and as you will realisedeeply relieved that position should seem clear and any misunderstandingsremoved. I am most grateful too for sympathetic consideration of local difficultiesof this problem shown by your counter-draft and for your kindness in putting mes0 fully in possession of nature of the (? doubt)s felt by the Cabinet, which 1readily appreciate.2. T have (? no difficulty) whatever in accepting your draft as it standssubject to two suggestions on drafting: (a) for &quot;War Advisory Committee&quot;I should prefer to speak of &quot; War Advisory Council,&quot; as in paragraph No 4 ofmy draft of 24th July; (b) draft speaks of &quot; matter (s) mentioned above.&quot; In fact,paragraphs 1 to 6 deal with position of minorities only, and not our specialobligations. Would it meet the case to amend to read : &quot; Subject to provisionfor certain matters for which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot divest themselves of responsibility, obligations arising out of their long connection with India&quot;without specifying the matters in question? Once I hear from Secretary ofState that Cabinet have approved, am I to concert immediately with him as todate of publication ?
