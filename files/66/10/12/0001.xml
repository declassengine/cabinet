(40)562 (Revise).)July 22, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ORGANISATION OE ALLIED NAVAL, ARMY AND air contingents.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.IN accordance with the Prime Minister &apos;s instructions, we submit thefollowing report on the organisation of Naval, Army and Air contingents.(Signed) C. L. N. NEWALL.DUDLEY POUND.J. G. DILL.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 22, 1940.A. French.(i) Navy.The naval situation is not yet clear.   This is inevitable until :-(a) The officers and men wishing to leave are repatriated.(b) All the remainder have made up their minds whether they intend to serve under General de Gaulle or in the British Navy,(c) The French naval organisation is improved.2. Recently, the majority of the ship&apos;s company of the old battleshipCourbet at Portsmouth, used as a Depot Ship for the French forces, left the ship and went to the Royal Naval Barracks. Admiral Muselier was persuaded toincrease the number of officers in her and improve the control oL the men.3. A good start has been made with the manning of those French ships which we have taken over, but the problem of sorting out the necessary partFrench complements will take time.4. The chief difficulty to good co-operation lies in the poor qualities ofleadership shown by many of the French officers. C-in-C., Portsmouth, says thatthe officers are more contented now that they know the conditions of service,but that they are apathetic where the interests of their men are concerned. Nodoubt this state of affairs will improve. The visit of the Prime Minister to a french ship at Portsmouth had a markedly good effect.[21553] B
5. C-in-C, Portsmouth, reports that the morale of the Frenchmen joining the Royal Navy is excellent, and that they are cheerful. They express cheerfulsatisfaction with the terms of service. At other ports the men seem to be gradually settling down.6. The following French ships have been taken over by the British Navy,and are being manned partly by British and partly by French officers and men.Destroyers Leopard.Le Triomphant.Mistral.Torpedo Boats Le Cordelliere.L&apos; Incomprise.Branlebas.La Melpomene.La Flore.Sloops A was.Epinal.Chevreuil.La Capricieuse.Leoville.Temeraire II.Pessac.Sauterne.Corvette La Malouine.9 Submarine chasers.A/S Vessels-Ambroise Pare.L&apos;Atlantique.Listrac.(ii) Army.7. General de Gaulle&apos;s troops are now quartered in the most up-to-datehutted camps at Aldershot and consist of 32 officers and 890 other ranks of theFrench Foreign Legion and a tank company, all armed with French rifles and light machine guns and 45 officers and 950 other ranks who have been transferred from the Reception Centre at Olympia and are unarmed. With the exceptionof the Foreign Legion and tank company all personnel have been issued with complete sets of clothing and gas respirators, or are about to be so equipped.Thirty-seven officers and 253 other ranks are still at the Reception centre at Olympia, awaiting transfer to Aldershot.8. The physical comfort and welfare of the troops at Aldershot is assured,as the camps are of the latest type and ample arrangements have been made asregards canteens, French Cinema Films and entertainments.9. A quantity of French Army stores have now been unloaded at UnitedKingdom ports, the principal items of which are 6 tanks, 4 75-mm. guns andlimbers, 10 anti-tank guns and limbers, 160 lorries and some 20 tractor vehicles.Four hundred tons of mixed French ammunition is also at Ordnance depots andis being classified.10. In addition to General de Gaulle&apos;s troops as detailed in paragraph 7there are at the White City 51 officers and 1,015 other ranks who desire to returnto France. Arrangements have now been made for French wounded, on dischargefrom Hospital, to report to New Seamen&apos;s Hospital, Gordon Street, W.C., whencethey can proceed either to join General de Gaulle&apos;s forces or to the White Cityto await repatriation.
(iii) Air Force.11. Since agreement was reached with General de Gaulle to form a smallFrench Air Force in this country, and that such flying personnel as were alreadytrained up to R.A.F. standards and were medically fit should be utilisedtemporarily in units of the Royal Air Force, practically all the available trainedfio-hter and bomber pilots have already been medically examined. Arrangements,too, have been made for most of the fighter pilots to join operational training units on the 20th July and the remainder on the 27th July, and for bomberpilots to be posted to bomber operational training units on the 27th July.A small number of French air personnel have already been attached toBomber Command to take part, as members of the crews of bombers in operations over Germany.12. A proposal is being examined to establish a training centre in Canadafor the untrained air personnel.B. Poles.(i) Navy.13. The Poles are manning some of the French smaller men-of-war and havebeen given the old French battleship Paris as a Depot Ship.14. The report about the Polish submarine personnel is excellent. To quotefrom a report from a senior British submarine officer on the Polish submarineWilk-&apos;&apos; A first-class unit of the flotilla.  Officers and men have settled into the life of the flotilla and wish to man another submarine when available.&quot;15.   The Poles have taken over the following French ships :-Battleship Paris.Destroyer Ouragon.Sloops Pomerol and Medoc.Submarine Chasers Nos. 11 and 15.(ii) Army.16 The Polish troops are now accommodated in five tented camps in the clyde Valley. Their strength is 4,600 officers, and 12,000 other ranks, under General Burdardt-Buckaki.The troops are in process of reorganisation into two mixed brigades. As soonas definite proposals for their rearmament have been agreed upon the necessaryissues as far as rifles, and a proportion of light machine guns, will be made. Thetroops are now beng reclothed.17.   They are at present in possession of the following arms :-(i) 3,400 French rifles of varying calibre.(ii) 154 light machine guns also of varying calibre.(iii) 13 heavy machine guns.and the following ammunition : (i) 150,000 rounds of rifle ammunition.(ii) 3,000 rounds for light machine guns.(iii) 9,000 rounds for heavy machine guns.18. A battalion of 1,000 Polish engineers has already been placed at thedisposal of the G.O.C., Scottish Command, for defence work.19. There are three British, Polish-speaking liaison officers in the camps.Welfare work is being attended to by Colonel Mitchell, M.P., who is in touchwith the Civic Authorities in Glasgow. The arrangements in the camps,particularly as regards cooking and hygiene, are being improved.[21553] B 2
20.   Pay is being issued to them on the following temporary scale :-General officers : 6s. per diem.Field officers : 4s. per diem.Junior officers : 2s. Qd. per diem.All other ranks : 6d. per diem.21. 800 of the 4,600 officers referred to above are unfit for activeemployment, and arrangements for their disposal are now under consideration.There are also 1,800 officers surplus to requirements, and arrangements are beingmade for their accommodation in a separate camp where it is intended toorganize them into an Officers1 Legion.22. A Military Liaison Mission, under Brigadier C. E. D. Bridge, is beingreconstituted.23. General Sikorski is visiting Polish camps himself at the end of thisweek. He will be accompanied by Brigadier Bridge, and General OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, Scottish Command, has been informed.(iii) Air Force.24. 198 Polish officers and 2,000 other ranks had already been incorporated in the R.A.F.V.R. and two squadrons had been formed before the recent arrival of approximately 4,800 Polish Air Force personnel following upon the collapse ofFrench resistance. The formation of additional squadrons from this newlyarrived personnel was to have started on the 15th July, but had to be postponedas the Polish authorities demanded facilities for the formation of a purely polish air Force.The principle that there shall be a Polish Air Force separate from but under the control of the R.A.F. for operations, discipline, &amp;c. has been accepted,and a formal agreement embodying this principle is being drawn up. Theformation of the additional squadrons will now proceed. The first PolishFighter Squadron is due to form on the 22nd July, followed by the second onthe 24th July. More Polish air personnel has arrived in the United Kingdom,and the total is now approaching 9,000.All Polish air personnel until posted to units will be concentrated atBlackpool.C. -Dutch.(i) Navy.25. Nothing but good reports are received about the Dutch. All their ships are fully employed in various British commands. Their submarines are particularly efficient, both as regards technical efficiency and handling. TheDutch Navy is spoiling for a fight, and would appreciate taking part in an offensive operation.26. Up to now there has been a good deal of unjustifiable suspicion of dutch seamen by local people at the Falmouth base; but this appears to berapidly disappearing. Dutch seamen in a recent air raid lay on top of children to save them from injury.27. In a recent report the Dutch Naval Liaison Officer wrote the following sentence :  &quot; It would be appreciated by the Dutch officers and sailors if they couldbe treated in the same way as British officers and men in so far as Aliens&apos;Restrictions are concerned.&quot;Subject to any essential security measures, it is considered that if this couldbe accorded to all Allied regular officers and men, the result would be beneficial to the Cause.28.   The Dutch have taken over the following French ships : Torpedo boat- Bouclier.Sloops Coucy.Belfort.
(ii) Army.29.   A Dutch Reception Camp has been established at Porthcawl, where theDutch troops, numbering 101 officers and 1,184 other ranks, are under canvas.Lieutenant-General Van Goor is in Command.These troops have all seen service in Holland and may be considered aspartially trained. They include 250 Military Police, who are elderly men but very well disciplined. The Dutch morale is fair, and improves rapidly, as they become more fully equipped and perform more duties.30. The Dutch authorities having given their approval, these troops arenow performing guard duties at two local aerodromes, and are providing sometrained mechanics for repair work with the Royal Air Force. Two battalionshave been formed, who perform guard duties and training on alternate weeks.The high proportion of officers is a difficulty, but the Dutch Military Mission isproposing to deal with this by requesting that the surplus officers should beattached to British units for training.31. Battle dress has been issued to all ranks. Rifles and ammunition were issued to the troops, and revolvers to the officers, on the 13th July.32. Payment to the Dutch troops is undertaken by the netherlands government.(iii) Air Force.33. One squadron of the Netherlands Naval Air Service is alreadyoperating with Coastal Command.The personnel of the Netherlands Military Air Service is largely untrained;the trained pilots and skilled personnel are to be incorporated in coastal command.D. -Czechs.(i) Army.34. The Czech troops started arriving in Cholmondeley Camp, Cheshire, onthe 6th July, and the total strength on the 16th July amounted to 690 officers and3,280 other ranks. General Viest is in command of the troops. The organisationof the Camp is excellent, and everything is being done to ensure the comfort ofthe troops. A British Czech-speaking officer, appointed by the War Office, is acting as Liaison Officer between the Czech Commander and the CampCommandant. He has reported that the Czech troops are co-operating well, andappear satisfied with their conditions.35.   Arms and ammunition brought by the troops are as follows :   :(i) Seventy-three rifles and 7 Bren guns, with 7,500 rounds of ammunition,58 pistols and revolvers, with some ammunition.(ii) The Czech camp guard is armed, and an anti-parachutist squad will be armed, when necessary, but otherwise all arms are in store in the camp.(iii) A further 25 rifles, 8 Bren guns, some signal equipment and motor cyclesare still to be unloaded from ships.(iv) Three field kitchens and about 40 bicycles have also arrived in the camp.Clothing. One set of underclothes per man 200 uniforms (battledress) and500 pairs of boots cover the most urgent requirements, and these have beenobtained from the Ordnance Depot, Burscough.36. As a temporary arrangement imprests are being granted to Czechmilitary authorities by the &apos;War Office, to enable payments to be made at thefollowing ratesQd. per day: All other ranks.2s. Qd. per day : Second-Lieutenants, Lieutenants and Captains.4s. per day : Majors, Lieutenant-Colonels and Colonels.6s. per day : All Generals.
Special rates while not accommodated and fed :  6s. per day : Second-Lieutenants, Lieutenants and Captains.8s. per day : Field Officers.11s. per day : Generals.Pay has already been issued under these provisional arrangements, but british army basic rates will come into force in the near future.(ii) Air Force.37. All the Czech airmen are now being examined by Trade Test Board andthe personnel for the fighter squadron have been selected. These are now beingattested and kitted. Already 32 officer pilots and 32 sergeant pilots have proceeded to Duxford as personnel for No. 310 Czech fighter squadron, where theyare undergoing preliminary training.Any personnel surplus to the requirements of the authorised bomber and fighter squadrons remaining at Cosford will be small, and these will be emplyed to the best advantage.E. -Norwegians.(i) Navy.38. The morale in some of the Norwegian ships has not been too good,although no misconduct has been reported. This has been due to lack of workand the fact that the men were brooding over the condition of their families in norway.It has now been pointed out to them that certain arrangements have beenmade for money to be set aside for their families.39. A number of Norwegian naval craft have been taken up for service.This will keep more men busy. In consequence of this, and the knowledge thatwe are anxious to make provision for their families, it is considered that the morale will soon be good.40. The Vice-Admiral, Dover, reports very favourably on the officers andmen under his orders, and states that the morale as a whole is of a very high standard.(ii) Army.41. A Norwegian Reception Camp has been established at Traqueer Mill,Dumfries. The military personnel in this camp now amounts to 112 officers and1,017 other ranks, under the command of Major Stenerson. A Norwegian-speaking liaison officer, appointed by the War Office, is quartered in the campand is a member of the Officers&apos; Mess. He reports that the morale is good, andwill be excellent as soon as arms can be supplied for training.42. A proportion only of these men are trained soldiers. A large numberof the remainder are from whaling ships, and have been called up for militaryservice.   They have little or no military training.43. A few rifles and machine guns for guard, drill and training purposes are available, but otherwise the troops are unarmed. Battledress has been issued to all ranks, with the distinguishing badge &apos;&apos; Norway &apos;&apos; on the shoulder, alsoboots and underclothing as required. The question of further issues of arms andequipment is under discussion with General Fleischer, Commanding Norwegiantroops overseas.44. The Norwegian authorities have signified their approval that the troops should assist in defensive works. Some 400 men are now helping with forestry,and other defensive works are being undertaken.45.   Payment of troops is undertaken by the Norwegian Government.(iii) Air Force.46. Arrangements have been made for the Norwegian Air contingent tobe trained in Canada, and it has sailed for the Dominion.
F. Belgians.(i) Army.47. The Belgian Reception Camp is situated at Tenby, in billets. Thestrength in camp is 69 officers and 396 other ranks.48. The Belgian Military Attache has agreed to these troops being used fordefensive or technical duties, and Western Command have been instructed toprovide suitable employment.The Belgian troops present greater difficulties of reorganisation than other allied contingents, for the following reasons : (i) The Belgian authorities have not yet decided whether to try and increase their numbers by the calling up of Belgian nationals, orto demobilise the contingent,(ii) The high proportion of officers and skilled workers, and the fact thatthese troops belong to all arms of the service.49. The personnel of the contingent has been supplied with underclothingand boots, but no arms or uniforms have yet been issued.50. Payment of Belgian troops is undertaken by the Belgian militaryauthorities in London.(ii) Air Force.51. Eleven officer pilots and 5 sergeant pilots have already been incorporated in the R.A.F.V.R. and 10 more pilots will shortly be commissioned or enlistedand posted. There are at present in this country only between 20 and 30 trainedBelgian pilots.G. Anti-Nazi Germans.A rmy.52. Until the 10th May, 1940, there was, in Bloomsbury Square, an AlienEecruiting Centre, where the names of aliens wishing to enlist were taken and passed on to A.G. 10.  These names were then checked by M.I.On the 10th May a training centre was opened at Westward Ho! where it now is.Recruiting for enemy aliens was stopped, but has now been reopened.53. There are in existence in the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps sevenAlien Companies, each of 280 men. All have been in France, and all are now employed in this country in non-protected areas. Steps are now being taken toraise an additional four companies, totalling approximately 1,000 men.Lord Reading, who takes an active personal interest in these men, has reported that their discipline and morale is excellent.Practically all members of the Alien Companies are Germans and Austrians,and Jews predominate.On the 13th July 223 Spaniards, lately members of the French ForeignLegion, were sent to Westward Ho! to join the training centre, with a view toformation into a Spanish Company.Pay  Normal British Army rates of pay and family allowance under usualconditions.
