The men in the French force appear to be settling down gradually, and itis hoped in a week or two to base all these ships together at the Nore whencethey will operate. This arrangement meets with the approval of the french admiral.A number of British Liaison Officers have been lent to the French force toassist them in fitting out and settling down.Aintree Camps.3. Since Admiral Cayol left the camp the men appear to have become muchmore tractable, and the situation has been further eased by the visit of CaptainDrew, Eoyal Navy, from the Admiralty, to bring up the question of increasedcomfort in the camps especially in regard to washing accommodation, beds andmattresses. Good work has also been done by local and other welfare societieswhile the Ministry of Information is now co-ordinating and introducingadditional amenities. The Ministry now issues daily a news sheet in French, andthis measure is an important one as up till recently the men were able to getlittle news.  Wireless sets are also being installed.(ii) Army.Alder shot.4. A accommodation. No change. As wounded soldiers now discharged fit for duty and recruits are swelling the numbers of General de Gaulle &apos;s army,additional accommodation at Aldershot is being sought.Equipment. French equipment in depots in this country, chiefly ex Norway,is being sent to Aldershot in order, on the one hand, to complete the equipment of the Foreign Legion as a fighting unit and, on the other hand, to providematerial for equipping and training the other units.
To date the only arrival is a battery of 4 75 mm. field guns with limbers,and a convoy of 50 vehicles of various kinds is shortly arriving.To this convoy will be added 11 tanks.Re-organisation. No re-organisation has been carried out yet, as the ForeignLegion has been organised as a separate unit ready to fight, and the remainingtroops as troops for training only, at the present stage, although quite a largeproportion of these will very soon be transferred to the same category as theforeign Legion.Employment. G.H.Q., Home Forces, is arranging with Aldershot command for the Foreign Legion to be given an active role in the defence scheme.Security. No change.Welfare. No change.Morale. Remains high.Pay. Permanent rates of pay are not yet settled. Advances are being madeto the troops at basic British rates which have been proposed to General de Gaulle.Note. Members of the press paid a visit to Aldershot on the 24th July, saw the men on parade and afterwards talked to them.On the 25th July, G.O.C., Aldershot Command, inspected the whole of theFrench forces at Aldershot.Olympia.5.   Accommodation. No change.Equipment. All recruits who have come in to this depot in civilian clothes,or discharged soldiers in uniforms which were not fit for service, have beenclothed in British battle dress immediately on joining. With the large amounts of French clothing now coming in from various depots, it is hoped that thedemands on British clothing may diminish, and that recruits will soon be ableto be clothed entirely in French uniforms.Re-organisation. None.Employment. The present strength of 518 officers and men at Olympia is greater than it should be, owing to the fact that it had not yet been possible toobtain extra accommodation at Aldershot. The moment this is available, noFrench soldier should stay more than a few days at Olympia.Morale. Very good.Welfare. A new officers&apos; mess has been opened which is well lit and wellventilated.Pay. As for Aldershot.White City.6. Since the removal of the French Officers to the York Hotel there hasbeen a definite improvement in morale. The men now take more pride in their personal appearance, and they make greater efforts to keep their quarters clean.Major Watkins reports that discipline is satisfactory.That their welfare has not been neglected is shown by the* following programme of amusement:-- July 17, 1940. 1,000 seats at Shepherd&apos;s Bush Pavilion.July 18, 1940. Concert at the Cercle Frangais.July 18, 1940. 40 seats at Palladium Theatre.July 20, 1940. 100 seats at Shepherd&apos;s Bush Cinema.July 21, 1940.

The question of the provision of winter accommodation for the Polish troops in Scotland cannot be settled until a decision has beenreached as to where they are to be employed. At present all except 2,250 are under canvas.It has been decided to appoint British Camp-staffs to each group of Polishcamps to work alongside corresponding Polish officers, until the latter are readyto take over.   This should greatly improve the administration of the camps.There is still a shortage of Soya stoves, tables and palliasses, but spray bathsshould be complete in each centre within a few days.Arrangements to transfer Polish G.II.Q. in London to more convenient and,from the security point of view, safer premises have been initiated.Equipment.

On the 27th July a conference took place with the A.C.I.G.S.at which the Polish Chief of Staff put forward his requirements in armament and equipment to place two mixed brigades on a war footing.Each Brigade will be organized on a three-battalion basis with three batteriesof field and one battery anti-tank artillery, engineers, field ambulance andtransport in each Brigade Group. The strength of the two groups, withoutForce H.Q., will be about 500 officers and 8,000 other ranks.The A.C.I.G.S. thinks it will be possible to issue rifles, Bren guns andSAA. up to full first-line scale almost immediately and the artillery, engineerand transport equipment progressively as it becomes available, beginning with perhaps a battery of each nature of artillery in each Brigade Group and thetechnical engineer and other equipment as it becomes available.The A.C.I.G.S. undertook also to investigate the possibility of issuing aspecimen tank or two and perhaps one or two guns of medium artillery fortraining purposes.Proposals to employ some of the surplus officers to man armoured trains andin cavalry squadrons, and the surplus specialist personnel as cartographers,fortification engineers and doctors are also being examined.
The Polish Sapper Battalion of about 1,200 all ranks is at work nearEdinburgh. They are armed 100 per cent, with French rifles, and have 100 roundsper rifle-  They have sufficient tools for their present work.Re-organisation.

He will be replaced in Scotland by General Kukiel, thepresent Vice-Minister of War. This latter post is to disappear. General Kukiel,who during the Pilsudski regime was Professor of History at the University ofKrakow, performed distinguished services as a Divisional Commander againstthe Russians in the last war.
