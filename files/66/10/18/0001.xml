THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 287.July 26, 1940.\TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. \It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE BALTIC  STATES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AS my colleagues will be aware from the press, the- three Baltic ministers have each presented me with notes formally repudiating the legality of theproceedings resulting in the incorporation of their countries in the Soviet Union,and expressing the hope that the incorporation will not be recognised by HisMajesty&apos;s Government. The information which they have supplied as to themethods of force and fraud used by the Soviet Government are confirmed byreports from His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at the three capitals; and therecan, I think, be no doubt that the incorporation has been effected against the will of the Baltic peoples and is, in effect, a conquest, of the same nature as the Germanconquests of Austria and Czecho-Slovakia and the Italian conquest of Albania.From the moral point of view, therefore, there is everything to be said for refusingrecognition.2. It is true that in ordinary circumstances refusal to recognise a faitaccompli of this kind usually does no good in the long run, either to the victimitself or to British interests, and that in the cases mentioned above His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were obliged to recognise the annexations of Austria and of Albaniaand would, no doubt, have had to recognise that of Czecho-Slovakia as well, hadnot the war supervened; but those annexations took place in time of peace andhad the appearance of relative permanence and finality. In the present case theannexations have taken place in the middle of a European war and for reasons connected with the course of the war, and there is no certainty that they will be permanent. There is reason to believe, indeed, that they are strongly resented inGermany, and that Hitler is resolved to expel the Soviet forces from the Balticas soon as he has an opportunity to do so. This being so, a premature recognitionof the annexations by His Majesty&apos;s Government would give the German Govern-ment an easy opportunity of posing as the champion of small nations and damagingour reputation in neutral countries, particularly in Sweden and Finland, wherethe Russian advance is watched with increasing anxiety. The United StatesGovernment, moreover, have set their faces resolutely against any recognition of soviet aggression, and Mr. Sumner Welles has just issued on their behalf ascathing denunciation of the Soviet action; and both they and American publicopinion would feel resentment if His Majesty&apos;s Government adopted the oppositecourse without convincing practical reasons for so doing.3. The question thus resolves itself into whether there are sufficient practical reasons which would outweigh these disadvantages. Can we, in shorty expectvaluable advantages from the Soviet Government in return for recognition, or11119   [21559J\
serious disadvantages if we refuse it? It does not seem likely, from Sir S.Cripps&apos;s reports of his conversations with MM. Stalin and Molotov, that wecould secure any change in the general attitude of the Soviet government towards us by throwing in the offer of recognition as an added inducement to them to change their present policy; and it is open to doubt whether a refusal to recognise could result in that policy being appreciably less forthcoming towards us than it is at present.4. A further consideration of importance in this connexion is the existenceof considerable British property and interests in the Baltic States (in Estoniaalone His Majesty&apos;s Minister estimates it at  1 million). Decrees have alreadybeen issued nationalising private property; and our experience of the similarproceedings in Soviet-occupied Poland has shown that the Soviet government recognise no right to compensation in such cases and make no exception for theproperty of foreign subjects. We have placed an embargo on Baltic funds in thiscountry, which are considerable, and we may be able to use this as a weapon forprotecting our interests; but the Soviet Government have already approached us with a demand that the gold of the Baltic State banks deposited with the Bankof England should be handed over to the Soviet State Bank, on the ground that orders to this effect were issued before the embargo was imposed, and if we recognise the validity of their proceedings in the Baltic States, we shall have no legal ground for detaining these assets. Non-recognition may also make it possible for us to utilise the Baltic shipping in British ports.5. In short, expediency in this case recommends the same course as morality;and even if circumstances should ultimately make it necessary for us to recognise the Soviet action, a refusal to do so at this moment will put us in a better position for defending our interests. The formula in which we reply to the notes of theBaltic Ministers should-&apos;therefore, I think, be such as will show that we refuserecognition for the present without tying our hands for the future; and I suggestthat it should be to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government, while expressingno views as to the future of the Baltic States, consider that the circumstancesattending the recent political changes in those States were not such as to causethem to cease treating the Ministers as the accredited representatives of theirrespective countries.H.July 26, 1940.
