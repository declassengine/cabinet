JlWAR cabinet coal PRODUCTIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council.President&apos;s Committee invite the attention of1.       The LordWar Cabinet to the increasing difficulty of ensuringcoal production adequate to meet essential needs.a leveltheofThe production target for the year beginning the 1st May,1942 is 215 million tons.      This does not take into account the economies to be secured by the proposed scheme for rationingdomestic fuel consumption. If this scheme is notintroduced until October,  and allowance is made for the initial difficulties likely to be encountered, I doubt whetherit will save more than about 5 million tons in the period underreview,        I have, therefore, assumed for the purposes of thismemorandum, that the minimum output required during the period is 210 million tons.2C       On this basis,  about 107 million tons must be produced in the six summer months,  and 103 million tons in the winter months - i .e. weekly output must run at the rate of 4.35million tons in summer and 4a2 million tons In winter.The labour force required to maintain this rate of output is not less than 720,000.        The numbers in the industry havefallen to 705,000.    Its weekly output is now 4.1 million tons*and may be expected to rise to 4,15 million tons under summerconditions.        To raise the weekly output to the requiredfigure of 4035 million tons, it is necessary to increase the effective labour force of the industry by 15,000 men, all ofwhom must be active coal-face workers a       Moreover, this mustdone at once if advantage is to be taken of the summerconditions favourable to peak productions Output lostduring the summer months cannot be made good, under winterconditionsobe3 b Therepower can b*ire only two sources from which additional man-drawn - (a)  other industries,  and (b) theArmy,(a) Other industries as a result of special f^f^l^^s w^hafof Labour during the autumn of 1941, J^OCO ex M of thedrifted away into other inJUBtrijfl, tftg Pcoal export trade, returned to work in the ^ gbour.forceallowing for wastage, the.net increase in the ^ beresulting from this scheme has ^en ] ,000. industries anddrawn from this source Without tapping k^y in scheme,occupations which have hitherto been exc.

a ri r*The Minister of Labour is now consulting with the other ministers concerned with a view to arranging for the release ofa proportion of the ex-miners now in .these vital industries.The Police (War Reserve) and Civil Defence Services will also make their contribution.       But it Is estimated that the numberlikely to be obtained from these sources is not more than 3,000,(b) The Army.Another 12,000 will have to be found if the labour forceof the industry is to be brought up to the total of 720,000;and these can only be found, quickly by withdrawing men from thefighting Services.        The mining industry has lost some 82,000of its younger men to the Armed Forces;  and, enquiries made last autumn   indicated that there were then over 25,000 coal-faceworkers serving&apos;as rank and file in the Army at home (excludingmen in certain special classes, e,g. tradesmen and men in R$A.C*formations, whose release the War Office were not prepared toconsider) .After discussion with the Secretary of State for War,  theLord President&apos;s Committee recently decided that all coal-faceworkers now serving as rank and. file in the Army at home,otherwise than in Field Force units, should be released as soonas practicable for employment in the mines (L.P.(42) 17thMeeting, Minute 2).        It is not yet known how many men may be covered by this decision.        Out of a list of 10,000 menprovided by the Mines Department, not more than 2,500 were thought to fall within the definition of those who might be released.        The Mines Department are now collecting a list of another 10,000 names:  and, if the proportions are the same, itmay be possible to find as many as 5,000 men outside the field force units.Even so, we should still be short of the numbersimmediately required by about 7,000.        A certain number mightbe combed out from ground staff of the R*A.Fe     But the main issue for decision by the War Cabinet is whether a substantial number of ex-miners should be withdrawn from Field Force units in the Army at home for work in the pits*The Secretary of State for War is opposed to the release ofany men serving in Field Force units.        The Ministers concernedwith production,  on the other hand, are satisfied that the coaloutput required during the coming summer cannot be attainedunless the labour force of the industry is brought up to 720,000aAnd the Lord President&apos;s Committee can see no way of finding thenumbers of men required, by the beginning of the summer, unlesssubstantial numbers of ex-minors are released from the &quot;army at homo.-2-

4 o a4, Even if it is possible by these expedients to raisethe labour force of the industry to the required figureduring the coming summer, we have still to face the problemof maintaining it thereafter at a level sufficient to meetessential war-time needs.      The average age of the men employed in the industry has risen substantially in recentyears,  and 40,6% of the men are now aged 40 or over,      Asa result, wastage is high - the net wastage rate is nowrunning at the rate of 28^000 a year.      Thus,  even thoughthe labour force is increased to 720,000 by the 1st May, 1942,it will drop again almost to its present level by thebeginning of the winter.     By the summer of 1943 wastagewould have reduced the.labour force to a level at which theannual   output would be less than 200 million tons,      fe maybe able to secure further economies in consumption, but wecould not expect by these means to close the gap between this level of output and our essential needs,-      And it willnot be possible&apos;to remedy the situation a second time bywithdrawing ex-miners from other industries or the armed forces -.- that is not an expedient which can be repeated yearby year.o5, In these circumstances, we cannot rest content withemergency measures for increasing the man-power in theindustrya     More lasting remedies are called fornWe must close the gap between normal intake-into, andwastage from, the industry - by attracting larger numbers ofyouths into the industry,,      The Minister of Labour isdiscussing with the Departmental Ministers concerned themeasures necessary to ensure, as part of a long-term plan,a more, regular flow of boys into the mines,,Secondly, we must secure such measures of re-organisation as are necessary to increase the war-time efficiency of theinduct ryt,6o The Lord Presidents Committee are satisfied that,apart altogether from the reduction in the labour force,some loss of output is attributable to defects of organisationand failure to make the most efficient use of the man-power available to the industry^      They are confident that, withthe sam-e labour force,  output could be materially increased if the organisation of the industry were so adopted as toensure that the men were employed at the points, giving thehighest return for their labour and that the mines were worked in the manner best serving the national interestScBy this they do not mean that all effort should be concentrated on winning the maximum amount of coal for war-timeneeds regardless of the future.      Such a policy would be disastrous.      It would raise difficult problems of compensation in respect of the uneconomic development of the mines,      But -and this is far more important - it - would impair the value ofthe mines as a national asset and would leave them at the endof the war with a crippling liability to capital expenditureon development work which would prevent them from recoveringtheir export -markets.      The sound policy is to ensure such a balance between maximum output and economic development aswill give the largest war-time production consistent withpreserving the capacity of the industry to recover itsexport trade after the war0

7, My Committee are also agreed that the   lost effectivemethod of securing this extended direction over the practicalworking of the mines is by development of the system of regional control.       They think it essential that RegionalControllers should be put in a position to exercise fulland effective control over the practical working of all the mines in their Region.8* The issue which emerges, and which the War cabinet will eventually have to decide, is whether it is possibleto secure effective &quot;operational&quot; control of the mines inthe national interests, while leaving untouched the financial responsibility of the mine-owners.    - In determining thatissue, and in deciding what form this operational control should take, the test must be whether any changes proposedin the organisation of the industry can be shown to benecessary for the more efficient prosecution of the war.In the case of other industries, including agriculture,it has been found possible to secure a sufficient measureof war-time control by powers of direction over management and men without interference with ownership5    and if it isfound necessary in the case of the mining industry - as inthe case of the railways - to go further and introduce ameasure of control affecting the ownership of the undertakingsit should be made clear beyond dispute that this course istaken solely on the ground that it is necessary for the more efficient prosecution of the war.The issue is one which must be brought to the noticeof the War Cabinet at once.      I suggest, however, that before any decisions are formulated a small Committee ofMinisters should be appointed to assist the president ofthe Board of Trade in working out, subject to any directionswhich the War Cabinet may give on the general issues ofpolicy involved, detailed proposals for securing suchpractical control over the working of the mines as isnecessary to increase the war-time efficiency of theindustry and to put it in a position at the end ofhostilities to compete for the early recovery of our export markets.(Initialled)    J.
