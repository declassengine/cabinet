The UnitedStates military authorities in India propose to make agradually increasing number of aircraft available for service between Dinjan in Assam and Myitkyina in Burma onthe return journeys of which some space may be availablefor refugees after wounded military personnel have beenprovided for.   This will be in addition to arrangements for evacuation by the Chinese and Indian civil air services which apparently are in operation already.The telegram shows that the authorities in Indiaalready have the co-operation of General Brereton throughwhom they will be able to bring to notice the importance -;fthis problem from the point of view of Indian political opinion.   In those circumstances it is perhaps undesirat-^to take the matter up also through His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Washington as previously suggested.L.
