The Moslem League are satisfied and preparedto accept scheme as it stands&apos; ..No* 871S3 tO liltopinions--scheme a Iin the waso far asa minoritJapanesein theirof Aprlernal -a-uThe :Gatogetherr and i^efutureT heand wou3.view eouCongress reaction you know fx^cm my telegram 2n&amp;*   According to nest information I can gettresses there are at least three sections ofndhiwing of non-violence wno are a gains &apos;c*- They.are indifferent as to what happensgard Great,Britain as defeated and unimportantof India is concerned&quot;    They are definitely*Ighting theremainder&apos; are all in favour ofd participate in war given conditions which-Id make their participation effective^5,,    It Is impossible to, estimate relative strengthof the two groups?, but the latter might if satisfied be able toswing Working Committee particularly if offer on Defence were sufficiently favourable to make any refusal, on that ground lookridiculous * - - *6a   Nothing can be done to meet Congress on theoints other than Defence-    The first point upon.&quot; independence&quot;is pot a vital one-   The second as to Indian States cannot bemet without upsetting seriously the States8 Rulers which i eoutctnot recommend&quot; at this stage-   The third on   on-Ac cession is vital to get Moslem League in and any change in that now would  ,only result in losing their support and we should be no hetteroff,The only point therefore for negotiation is ourClause (S) which as you know was purposely left vague apart, fromgeneral principle of.retention of defence^8*    I must make it clear that so far as thisPoint is concerned,-- the demand for transfer responsibility hascome from all sides except Moslem League and&apos;Sikhs.   Many Moslems&apos;P*T*0*
have demanded, ii individually e.g. Prime Minister Bengali general trend of press is that it is a universal demand and if Congressrefuse on this point whatever their actual views may be all othercommunities including Moslem League will probably point to itas a reason for refusals9-   I must point out that if Congress do not accept no onewill daise to state that they will accept scheme^    I should expect itto be turned down by all sections including Moslems already although \they have in fact passed a unanimous resolution accepting it intheir Working Committee-10*   In the&apos; event of acceptance by Congress I am informedfrom a good source that non violent group will probably retire fromall participation in Working Committee during the war and will leaveother leaders ( Maulana Azadj, Nehru and Ralagopalachari)  to carryOils - .11-   These three are (? combatant) and Working committee under their.controls I am satisfied that if once they come in theywill go all out to maximise Indian resistance to Japan and willfight with courage and determination to galvanise Indian people to action^    They have told me that there would be no question whatever ofany separate peace and I am certain this can be relied upon.--12u    Estimates will differ as to how far their.coming in will or can help in the actual prosecution of the war*The two main factors in my view are- first that they willbe able to assist greatly in preventing panic and maintaining moraleamongst the great masses of civilian population and organising themin civil defence of all kinds,  and second the Moslems also will come in and throw their weight Into the war..13-    In addition I think that general psychological effecton Allied cause vri.ll be good especially in all eastern theatres of war including the Near and Middle Basta-14.   There will of course be risks of differences between his Majesty?s GcvU and Indian Government, but these seem to me tobe iimimportant an view of major considerations stated in paragraphs12 and 13*15*   If they do not accept,-,  then situation will in my-viewbecome very difficult as we shall be attempting to carry on the warin at best a neutral atmosphere and at the worst a hostile one; agreat deal &amp;f suppression will be necessary and this will again exace:nationalist feeling and no section of- the people will be prepared tocome out in open support of H*M* Govt*18.   it is in these circumstances that we must decide how farcan go with safety in giving to an Indian Minister control of defers&quot;,^QVlv, 3;7\,So ?a** as functions of the Commander in-Chief as such alconcerned, there can be no question whatever as to taking any exist!power away from Commander- in-Chief *m 18. It is only in his capacity as Defence Minister that airyquescion can arise.. Under the new arrangement whereby the Executivecouncil win approximate to a Cabinet presumably any question comingwitnin -che competence of the Govt. of India (. as defined in the amended Clause (E)) will be for decision by Govt. of India as a whole and not by any particular Minister-19-    This Will relate to all question   of *policy as&apos;distinct from administration.
- 25,.   If you apbrove principle of Co) I can work out detailsof actual wording&apos;of offer with C.-in-C* and Viceroy.25,,     There Is a small chance of acceptance as regardsPara.No,20 Cc) and a better chance as regards para.No.20 (bj.    Ifthere is acceptance by Congress, I anticipate the Moslem leaguewill come In and this will be a large enough measure of acceptanceto proceed with scheme,    Other bodies too will probably come Inso as not to lose chance of seats in new Government.27,    In the event of acceptance,, there will of course &quot;be difficulties as to apportionment of seats when Viceroy comes toform his new Government and I -would propose in that event to staytill new Government is formed.28*    It is a matter of urgency to decide as to how we propose to proceed and I ask you to consider question most urgentlyas I am. convinced we must make some offer to meet the situation.I am asking Viceroy and Commander--in-Chief to telegraph20*    There seems to &quot;be three possible courses open - (a) to stand upon present position that nothing further can be done by wayQt compromise.(&quot;b) To take risks entailed and. to -hand over- Defence ministry to an Indiant subject to a convention in writing that Defence( Minister will not in any matter affecting prosecution of the war actcontrary to the policy laid, down by His majesty s. Government andcommnnicated, through G* in. 5.(e) To create some new office for an Indian Ministerconnected with Defence and.to. hand over to him any functions ofDefence Ministry which       in Ci considers can. be so handed over safelyand practicably a21..    As to (a) above? this would be a fatal policy for two reasons,.    First it makes failure inevitable and second it leaves-.His Majesty5s Government open to criticism that we were merelystubborn when some small concession might have made all thedifference, .22,    I should-personally prefer to offer (b) as thia would think have the best chance of acceptance.    But in view of theimmediate dangers and G*  in G*ss view of confusion that might be caused I cannot press it as strongly as otherwise I would.25,    As to (e) I doubt very much that there is any chanceof acceptance.    But nevertheless if you decide that you cannot actin accordance with paragraph 22 ? then I think this should be &quot;triedon the off-chance of acceptance and in any event so as to show wehave done our utmost to reach an.accommodation,24,.    In this regard after discussion I think that best that could be done to give effect to para. 3d,, 20 (c) would be to(a) make C^-dn-GD War member instead of Defence member and turnDefence Department into War Departments  (b) set up a defence -ordination Department to take cn duties of present Defence-Co-ordination Section and certain things now done- by defence department e.      public relations and any/ other functions agreed totjr C. -in-Go

It could arise in its most acute form if they were to demand cessation of hostilities in India against guns of His Majesty&apos;s Government.

7. There should be no doubt that C.-in-C. will be in effective control of all functions of defence Department remaining in his hands. Moreover C. in-C. (through over-riding powers of (?Governor-General) if necessary) must also have as much control as is necessary and practicable, - in areas outside field of active military operations, over functioning of other departments in matters affecting fighting value of and facilities for Army. On the other hand the views of all members of Council at Council level on any matter (including matters falling within defence department portfolio) would of course have all influence that would inevitably flow from danger of their resignation.

8. Given a real desire to fight war, this position should satisfy Indian demands for a real and substantial degree of control and responsibility over whole field of defence.
