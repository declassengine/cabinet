THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 155.April 10, 1942.WAR CABINET.PROPAGANDA AT HOME.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.I AM anxious to have the guidance of the War Cabinet upon the formulation of a propaganda policy at home. One of the main functions of the Ministry ofInformation was defined bv the Cabinet last July as follows (W.P. (41) 149,2/7/41) :-&quot; (6) to publicise and interpret Government policy in relation to the war, tohelp to sustain public morale and to stimulate the war effort, and tomaintain a steady flow of facts and opinions calculated to further the policy of the Government in the prosecution of the war.&quot;2. At this stage of the war public feeling and the public&apos;s reactions to thewar cannot any longer be taken for granted. To study them, to assess them andto adjust our publicity to meet them is now a much more important concern ofthe Government than it was two years ago. Yet this publicity cannot be whollyeffective unless it interprets the considered policy of the War Cabinet as a whole and unless the actions of Ministers and Departments generally are consistent with it.3. It is easy to exaggerate disquieting features by a morbid attention tothe various techniques of taking the public pulse. However, making all allowances for overstatements and obsessions, there are some currents of feeling in thecountry about which there can be no dispute, and I venture to mention two ofthem.4. There has been in recent months a widespread decrease in confidence. Tosome extent this confidence will ebb and flow with the course of events, but weshould be altogether too complacent if we merely waited for a run of successesto restore it.5. There is a prevalent sense of frustration. In some ways this is a goodsign, even though an awkward companion. It is a sign of energies unused andenthusiasms unabsorbed, but it also induces a loss of interest in the grim realities of the present. Many people want the war to be over so that they can be free to start on something positive and constructive for the future. They do not find inour present avowed purposes the impulse to a crusade or to a genuine fervourof endeavour.6. With a view to formulating a propaganda policy which will heal publicailments of this sort as they develop, I should like to suggest for the considerationof the War Cabinet the following procedure : (a) The Minister of Information should circulate to the War Cabinet oncf/a month an appreciation of the state of public morale.   This shouldtake into account, in its preparation, the views of any other Depart-ments primarily concerned with the Home front.[23687]
(b) This appreciation would contain recommendations as to any general lines which publicity should take in the ensuing month.(c) The decisions of the War Cabinet would be taken as a Directive binding on all Departments until further notice.7. In the meantime I suggest that approval should be given now to thefollowing positive directions on the general lines which Government publicity should follow : (i) There must be more explanation : not only about the armed forces andthe war situation but also about production, labour, war-time restric-tions and the big problems that affect the life of everyone to-day.When the public is bewildered by something new a failure to explainmeans the risk of driving a wedge between Government and public,and this fact must be given full weight when security risks suggest the withholding of explanation,(ii) We must stop appealing to the public or lecturing at it. One make sit furious, the other resentful. General appeals to the public or particular sections of it to work harder should not be made. Thereare too many people already working to the limit of their capacityor unable to do so for reasons beyond their control.(iii) In dealing with the news it is essential not merely to be but to give thepublic the impression of being candid and objective. Harm can bedone to public confidence by failure to allow for this. An official com-munique must be a report to the public; and every tendency to specialpleading should be eliminated.(iv) Great care must be taken to deal with any rumours or complaints that have wide acceptance. These are either justified or groundless. Ifthey are groundless, they must be exposed. If they have substance,there must be an authoritative statement, as soon as possible, showingeither that their cause is being rectified or that it cannot berectified, and why.B.
