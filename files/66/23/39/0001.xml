VERMMENTTHIS DOCUMENT IS TUB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1942.SECRET: i Copy No. 2W.P. (32) 159.April 10, 1942.SiWAR CABINET.EXTERNAL MONETARY AND ECONOMIC POLICY.Preliminary Discussions with the United States.Memorandum by the Paymaster General.THE primary objective underlying the declaration in Article VII of the mutual Aid Agreement of the 23rd February, 1942, is the attainment of thegreatest possible expansion of trade, and especially of international trade. Thefurther objective is the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce and the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers.The last branch of the Article provides that at an early convenient dateconversations shall be begun between the United States Government and theUnited Kingdom Government with a view to determining, in the light of governingeconomic conditions, the best means of attaining the above-stated objectives bytheir own agreed action, and of seeking the agreed action of other like-mindedGovernments.Mr. Winant has suggested that the best way of beginning these conversa-tions would be for a body of some five or six expert representatives of the UnitedStates Government to come to this country at an early date for the purpose of preliminary talks. Mr. Winant is understood to be discussing this question in washington at the present time, and it is anticipated that a visit of this charactermay be expected within a few weeks.2. In the meanwhile, the Treasury, in consultation with other Depart-ments, have prepared a Note which endeavours to envisage the probableconditions of the post-war world both generally and in particular as they affectthis country, and reviews a number of projects and proposals in the external economic sphere such as call for consideration under the terms of the declaration.This Note is prefaced by a short Memorandum suggesting topics fordiscussion, together with the general point of view from which they might be approached, in preliminary exploratory talks. (The Memorandum is attached as Annex A to this paper; it has not been thought necessary to annex the Note.)3. My Committee on Reconstruction Problems have had these documentsunder consideration, and they recommend to the War Cabinet as follows : (1) That the War Cabinet should give authority to begin as soon as possibleinformal, non-committal and exploratory talks with American repre-sentatives in the course of which the United Kingdom representatives should compare notes with the Americans on a number of constructive ideas, some of which have been formulated in theTreasury Memorandum.(2) That in view of the desirability of bringing Russia into consultationat an early stage the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should beinvited to discuss the matter with the Russian Ambassador at theappropriate time.T23694] B
(3) That it should be left to the Secretaries of State for the Dominions,India and Burma to decide when the suggested basis of discussion should be communicated to the Governments of the Dominions, Indiaand Burma.(4) That the accompanying draft telegram (Annex B) to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington regarding the opening of the preliminaryconversations should be approved.4. I should propose to select the United Kingdom representatives for thesepreliminary talks in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade.The Ministers in charge of Departments not represented on my Reconstruc-tion Committee will be kept informed, so far as their Departments are concerned,of the course of the talks with the Americans, and consulted when necessary.I ought, perhaps, to add that on the question of Imperial Preference, onwhich there have been previous exchanges with the United States Administra-tion, any preliminary talks will naturally be of an especially non-committalcharacter. *-    (Initialled) W. A. J.Richmond Terrace, S.W.\,April 10, 1942.
ANNEX A.ARTICLE VII OF THE MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT OF THE23rd FEBRUARY, 1942.Memorandum Submitted by the Treasury on Preliminary Discussions withthe United States.1. The starting-point of the forthcoming discussions with representativesof the United States Administration will no doubt lie in the relevant passagesof the Atlantic Charter and the Mutual Aid Agreement as follows : Atlantic. .&apos;&apos; Fourth, they will endeavour, with due respect for theirCharter. existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the tradeand to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity.Fifth, they desire to bring about the&apos; fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field, with the object of securingfor all improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security.&quot;&apos;&apos; Article VII.&quot; In f,he final determination of the benefits to be provided tothe Uniteo1 States of America by the Government of the UnitedKingdom in return for aid furnished under the Act of Congress ofthe 11th March, 1941, the terms and conditions thereof shall be such as not to burden commerce between the two countries, but topromote mutually advantageous economic relations between themand the betterment of world-wide economic relations. To that end,they shall include provision for agreed action by the United Statesof America and the United Kingdom, open to participation by allother countries of like mind, directed to the expansion, by appropriate international and domestic measures, of production,employment, and the exchange and consumption of goods, whichare the material foundations of the liberty and welfare of allpeoples; to.the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce, and to the reduction of tariffs and othertrade barriers; and, in general, to the attainment of all the economic objectives set forth in the Joint Declaration made on the12th August, 1941, by the President of the United States ofAmerica and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.At an early convenient date conversations shall be begunbetween the two Governments with a view to determining, in thelight of governing economic conditions, the best means of attaining the above-stated objectives by their own agreed action and of seeking the agreed action of other like-minded Governments.&quot;2. The primary objective underlying these declarations is the attainment ofthe greatest possible expansion of trade and especially of international trade.No country can have a greater interest than this country in such an objective.Lack of employment was for long before the war a continuing anxiety. ThisI country also, with its dependence on overseas trade, has a vital interest in the prosperity of other nations, which is the most important single factor in the flow of international trade.3. It is in the subsidiary points of the declaration, especially in regard to questions concerned with the elimination of so-called discriminatory practices and arrangements (including in particular Imperial Preference), that divergencesof view may be expected to be found..    [23694] b 2Mutual Aid.Agreement.
4. Of necessity the more general declarations are no more than aspirations:until they have been clothed in policies calculated to attain them, and the objectOf the preliminary exploratory conversations must no doubt be to interchangeviews and seek points of agreement upon such policies. The present is, no doubt,the most favourable moment for initiating Anglo-American co-operation inrelation to the expansion of international trade and other economic questions.5. The attitude of the United States Administration is likely to be muchinfluenced by our general approach to these discussions. If we start by accepting the desirability of restoring multilateral exchange and trade to the fullest possible extent, but explain the very serious practical difficulties which confrontnot only the United Kingdom but other countries before these objectives can berealised and the need to work out bold and constructive measures on an inter-national basis which will help the world to make progress in overcoming these difficulties, it may be hoped that the United States Administration will beprepared to give full consideration both to the difficulties and to any solutionswhich we may have to propound.6. The United States representatives, it may be assumed, will be aware ofthe general initial attitude of the Administration towards all these questions,and it seems probable that certain particularised proposals (referred to below)will be brought up at an early stage. Ministers will no doubt wish, withoutreaching final decisions upon any matters at this stage, to give to the UnitedKingdom representatives, for their guidance in discussion, broad indications of lines of exploration which they would prima facie regard as expedient andinexpedient respectively. The object of this note is to indicate some of thematters about which such guidance may be required.7. So far as this country is concerned and the same will probably be true of most countries the new policies will fall to be applied in a period ofunexampled economic difficulty in the external sphere. We shall start the periodof peace with great liabilities and with small reserves both of exchange and of resources that could be turned into exchange. The Economic Section of the. WarCabinet have made estimates which suggest that in the absence of correctivemeasures our adverse balance of payments over the first five years taken as a wholemay be in the region of  1,000 millions.8. The Treasury have in these circumstances prepared a note* analysingthese difficulties and discussing possible remedies, including, in particular,ambitious remedies designed to further the objects set out in the generaldeclarations and to set up an expansionist trend in the trade of the world.9. The declarations are especially concerned with expansion of production,interchange of goods and improved labour standards. But at the outset a general problem presents itself that of exchange control. This instrument may be usedfor control of both capital movements and of current trade transactions : in thelatter connection it is capable of being highly discriminatory to the extent that itis possible to refuse or allow exchange for particular trade transactions. thus the relaxation and eventual abolition of the use of exchange control for regulatingtrade transactions must be an important objective. But the question remainswhether its machinery ought not to be retained! for use in connection with capital movements.10. A principal factor of economic disturbance in recent pre-war years wasthe irresponsible mass movement of private speculative funds from one countryto another from fear of loss or hope of gain. There seems little prospect that afterthe war such complete security will be restored as to eliminate the underlyingeconomic and political mistrusts which engendered these speculative movements and so long as this is the case some measure of governmental regulation appearsto be the only means of checking the injury they cause. Such regulations may alsobe required to prevent private investment on foreign stock exchanges and privatesubscriptions to foreign loans being undertaken on a scale inconsistent with thecountry&apos;s balance of payments on current account.11. To-day, in almost every country save the United States, the external move-men t of private capital is regulated.   It is suggested that that regulation ought-r&apos;t * Not reproduced.
to continue, notwithstanding that without postal censorship the regulation cannotbe fully effective and that for practical reasons it must involve centralisation of themanagement of exchange business and some degree of vexatious formality for allengaged in overseas transactions, including possibly those within the Empire.From our point of view it would be desirable, though it may well prove impracticable-able, that the United States should also establish such a regulative system. It issuggested that this is an important subject and should be explored as such in theforthcoming discussions.12. The prevention of undesirable capital movements would be one important step towards ending, or at least mitigating, the immense currencymalaise which afflicted European countries and many other countries in thenineteen thirties, which ended in the United States becoming the depository ofthe main part of the stock of monetary gold, and which contributed materiallyto the tying up of international trade in elaborate and harmful involutions. Inaddition, on any long view, there is great need for a new or improved system organisation for the settlement of international balances on current account.Such a system or organisation would not of itself set at rest the immensedisequilibria from which the world is likely to suffer at the end of the war, but itwould provide a medium which, in conjunction with other agencies and actions,would give the best chance of a prosperous world.13. There has accordingly been drawn in the Treasury an ambitious plan for a new organisation (styled for short a Clearing Union) which aims atsubstituting an expansionist for a contractionist pressure on world trade generally. Its objective is to provide in the international sphere an organisation which will perform for participating States the functions performed for individuals by the ordinary banking system, i.e., the clearance of accounts, debitand credit, between different customers and the provision of overdrafts for thosewho need them. To this Clearing Union the principal countries of the world would adhere and it would have the function of settling international balances of payments, no longer by the delivery of gold, but by credits and debits in anew international currency (called bancor) which would have a fixed value in gold and would be accepted as in all respects the equivalent of gold. It has been provisionally assumed that any such organisation would be founded by the UnitedStates and United Kingdom, who would permanently retain the management andcontrol. A member State which on balance owed to countries payments which itwas not in a position to discharge would be given facilities in the nature of anoverdraft. A member State, on the other hand, which on balance was owed moneyby the other member States could not recover it except by accepting goods or services from the rest of the world. The relative value of the currencies of member States would be determined in the first instance in agreement with theGoverning Board and thereafter could (except under prescribed conditions) be varied only in agreement with that Board.14. The debit or credit balance of member States with the Clearing union would give a measure of the balance of payments of the countries concerned andthis might well facilitate agreed undertakings to forgo certain types of traderestrictions subject to reservations relating to the protection of the country&apos;balance of payments.15. The Clearing Union would be a centre round which other international agencies could gather. It would provide convenient means for financingPost-War Relief, &quot;International Development Schemes and Commodity ControlSchemes. It could co-operate also in schemes to control the trade cycle and thussecure the maximum degree of employment.16. Neither the full argument for such a scheme, nor the fall details, nor afull indication of its difficulties can be explained in brief compass, though atten-tion should perhaps be drawn to the fact that like all schemes for the creation ofinternational institutions it raises difficult problems of permanent management and control.17. It would appear unnecessary to attempt at this stage to form any finaljudgment on the practicability or desirability of such a plan. The question is rather whether the United Kingdom representatives in the preliminary discussions should put forward the general aims and characteristics of such a plan (perhaps
using the plan as an illustration of a possible means of attaining the objectives)as a basis for discussion and exploration.18. The United States Administration has shown itself greatly pre-occupied with schemes for the regulation of production, marketing and price of primary commodities. There is much to be said for an attempt at an international organisation for steadying the prices of primary products and the holding ofbuffer stocks a plan designed, inter alia, to limit the necessity for individualrestriction schemes with all the international friction they engender. the drawing of such a plan is now nearing completion, and when it is ready it isproposed to ask Ministers whether this subject should be introduced into thediscussions.19. Two American Professors, Messrs. Hansen and Gulick, have producedplans for attaining some of the general objectives, and of these plans more islikely to be heard.20. Firstly, they propose an International Economic Board, with researchstaffs in various centres, to advise collaborating Governments in regard to internalpolicy to promote full employment, a rising standard! of living and the world-wideuse of productive resources, together with an International Resources Survey forexploring opportunities for internal and regional development projects through-out the world. If it should prove practicable to establish an Advisory EconomicBoard of this character at the outset, its first function might well be to adviseparticipating Governments upon measures to avoid excesses of initial boom and subsequent slump in the early post-war period.21. The second is a more ambitious and difficult proposal for the revival ofinternational lending under international control through a corporation withcapital stock subscribed by the United States Government, the British Govern-ment, the Dominion Governments and other participating Governments, andbonds privately subscribed under guarantee by the several Governments &quot; inappropriate proportions.&quot;22. The first of these proposals must, it is suggested, be discussed recep-tively; the second also has attractive features, though it may come to grief oiidifficulties of a severely practical kind. It is suggested, further, that if a clearing Union plan is found to have prospects of fruition, methods of linkingthe second proposal with that Union should be explored with a view to overcomingsome of the difficulties.23. It is judged likely that among plans to secure the major objectives theUnited States representatives may bring up the question of nutritional policies(with their reactions on demand for primary commodities). There is, however,at present little evidence of the nature of probable proposals in this field. Theymay include such diverse questions as relaxation of agricultural protection(especially in the form of tariffs), encouragement of higher standards of con-sumption (either by a general lowering of prices of desirable foods or by special arrangements for distribution of such foods to poor consumers), and improvementof live-stock and diminution of cereal production.24. The foregoing projects probably cover the main types of proposal likelyto come forward to attain the general objectives of securing full employment andgeneral prosperity. There remain the questions raised by the second branch ofArticle VII the aim of eliminating all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce and reducing tariffs and other trade barriers and bythe corresponding passage in the Atlantic Charter. The United States aimappears to be (a) the reduction (presumably on the basis of reciprocity) of traderestrictions which are not, or supposedly are not, discriminatory in their effect- &quot;tariffs and trade barriers&quot; are the words used and (b) the elimination(presumably on a like basis) of trade restrictions which are, or supposedly are,discriminatory : control of current exchange transactions, payments agreements,import restrictions and quotas, and State trading systems will all probably come under discussion under this head.25. The ambitious schemes mentioned earlier in this note do not profess tobe automatic solutions of all the economic disorders with which the world will be
afflicted after the war, nor do they get rid of the fundamental need to re-establishafter the war a proper equilibrium in the international balance of payments.Whether they are adopted or not, there will remain grave doubt whether for someperiod after the war this country, or indeed many other countries, could afford to forgo various forms of control of trade and exchange without the most serious economic risks, including the risk of a currency collapse such as many countriesexperienced after the last war. Our own difficulties in this respect have been recognised by the United States Administration. There is also the question ofImperial Preference and the somewhat analogous question raised by regional economic arrangements possibly to be instituted in Europe or South America.Added to this is the problem how far the elimination of discriminatory practicescan go without becoming incompatible with the trend of internal social andeconomic policy likely in future to prevail both in this country and elsewhere.There is also the question of the applicability of this policy in the relations of fully developed countries with low-cost producers such as Japan, or with countries, ifany there be, still contemplating aggression.26. It may well prove that the United States Administration will equallyneed to reserve powers which might be made the subject of objection. We shallhave to explore with their representatives what should be the rules of the economicgame in the post-war world. It is suggested that the exploratory discussions should include an explanation, on the United Kingdom side, of the dimensions ofour special problem and discussion of the intrinsic difficulties involved in thetotal elimination of safeguarding devices, but that, if it should appear that asubstantial clash of views is likely to arise, all question of the formalcommitments we could afford to enter into on this subject should be deferred until; after exploration of the constructive economic arrangements and new international institutions or practices which Anglo-American influence could beused to establish or encourage in the post-war world.27. Both on political and economic grounds our policy must contemplate; the co-operation of the Dominions and India with us in any new economic arrangements which may take shape. It is important, therefore, that we should endeavour to consult them and to carry them with us throughout. The australian and New Zealand Governments have already made it clear that they expect tobe given full opportunity of learning our views and presenting their own.Although representatives of the Dominions and India cannot convenientlyparticipate in the initial stages of the exploratory discussions, it would seem very desirable that these discussions should not begin without the knowledge, and ifpossible, the active sympathy and support of Dominion Governments and theGovernment of India. It is assumed, therefore, that Ministers would wish astatement of their general attitude and initial standpoint to be communicated tothose Governments forthwith.28. It should be added that, at the International Labour Conference heldin New York last November, which the Deputy Prime Minister attended, aResolution on Reconstruction after the War, proposed by the United states delegation, was passed unanimously. An Emergency Committee of the governing body of the I.L.O. is to meet in London on the 15th April to discuss the actionto be taken on this Resolution.29. The principal questions for consideration of Ministers arising out ofthis Memorandum appear to be (a) Whether, in the preliminary discussions with the United States, theUnited Kingdom representatives should put forward the general aims and characteristics of a Clearing Union plan described in outlinein paragraphs 13 to 16 (perhaps using the plan as an illustration ofa possible means of attaining the objectives) as a basis for discussion and exploration.(&amp;) Whether proposals, if they emerge from the American side, for theestablishment of (1) an Advisory International Economic Board, and(2) an International Corporation for the revival of foreign lendingshould be discussed receptively, subject to the qualification in thesecond  case  that  serious  practical  difficulties  are  undoubtedlyinvolved.
(c) Whether the question of the regulation of international movement ofprivate capital, and especially of mass movement of speculativecapital, should be brought up as an important objective forexploration.(d) Whether the general approach to the problem of. &quot; discriminatorytreatment in international commerce &apos;&apos; indicated in paragraphs 24to 26 of this Memorandum is approved.(e) Whether there should be consultation with the Governments of theDominions and of India designed, if possible, to secure their activesympathy and support as regards the general standpoint at the start of the preliminary discussions.ANNEX B.Draft telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington.Please inform the Government to which you are accredited that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have been carefully considering how best to make a start on the conversations provided for in Article VII of the mutual Aid Agreement. We welcome Mr. Winants proposals. Our presentview is that preliminary informal exploratory and non-committal talks shouldbe begun as soon as possible. The experts engaged should have the fullestdiscretion to discuss all possible lines of action which appear to them to be worthexploring and we would not propose to limit in any way their terms of reference.The purpose of the talks would be to thrash out on broad lines measures designedto deal with the outstanding problems of post-war economic reconstruction. Theconclusions arrived at by the Joint Meeting would then, of course, have to besubmitted to the two Governments, and the two Governments would be in aposition to widen the discussion by bringing in the Dominions, India, Russia andthe other Allies.
