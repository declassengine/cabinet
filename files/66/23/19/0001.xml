OLIVER LYTTELTON.  M.P.,  ONHIS PERIOD OF OFFICE AS MINISTER OF  STATE.Prime Minister.THE position of the Minister of State in the Middle East is one of some difficulty, because he is continuously dealing with matters for which other ministers have parliamentary responsibility, and he cannot carry out his functions without a great deal of forbearance and confidence being shown towardshim by Ministers at home. I would like to say that I enjoyed both these advantages during my tenure of the Office.I feel that if the duties of the Minister of State could be set down very shortly, they are these :To arrange, by his personal influence, that one agreed recommendation fromthe three Services and the various Departments of State represented in theMiddle East goes home to the Cabinet in London, which can either reject it oraccept it on grounds of high policy. If he is unable to do this, each department would make its own representations to London, and a decision would have to bereached by those who are necessarily remote from local conditions. It is not, ofcourse, always easy to avoid an agreed recommendation being in the nature of a compromise, and this should be avoided. I must say, however, that His Majesty&apos;ambassador, the three Commanders-in-Chief, and other representatives of theCrown and the Departments of State, always dealt with the questions which ciroseon the broadest lines, and were willing to sink any individual differences for thebenefit of a sharply defined and unequivocal recommendation. I must express mydeepest gratitude to them for this attitude, and for the help they constantly gaveme, without which it would have been impossible for me to have discharged anyof my duties.The following report deals chiefly with facts.(Intld.) O. L.I arrived in Cairo with a staff of three administrative officers on the5th July. Further staff was sent out during July, and by the beginning ofAugust my office was established as I had planned.I have sought to carry out the functions assigned to me by establishing asmall office, akin to the Cabinet Office in London, rather than an executivedepartment. My office has not undertaken executive duties, except for thecontrol which I was asked to exercise over our relations with the Free French in syria. Executive action in other matters, which has to be taken under mydirection, is taken by associated departments, looking to me for guidance on general policy.This small and simple organisation has proved flexible and adequate to meetthe strain which has on occasion been put upon it.[23589] r
Early in July the Middle Eastern War Council was created. This body isof course, oniy an advisory body and has no corporate responsibility. Neverthe-less, the Council and its Sub-Committees have served as a valuable central organisation to enable the Services and other authorities in the Middle East to consult together and act on a common plan.2. Relations with the Commanders-in-Chief.In August, at the suggestion of the Commanders-in-Chief. a DefenceCommittee was set up as a Sub-Committee of the War Council.The purpose of the Defence Committee has been to concert action betweenthe three Services and to avoid bringing to the War Council technical or detailedproblems on military subjects.The Committee has proved of great value and some examples of the mannerin which a Minister of Cabinet rank can assist Commanders-in-Chief should beplaced on record.Firstly, the presence of an independent Chairman has helped to resolveconflicts of interest between the three Services.Secondly, discussion on the Committee has enabled me to send to Londonan agreed view instead of separate views being expressed by each of the Services.Thirdly, in emergency I have been able to assume responsibility as a memberof the War Cabinet for decisions of high moment. For example, general auchinleck was, as he has informed me, glad to have the support of a minister on the spot when it was necessary to take the difficult decision to relieve GeneralCunningham of his command shortly after operation &quot; Crusader &quot; began.Finally, a Minister, who is served with an adequate staff, is able to relieve the heads of the three Services of responsibilities in many fields of politics andeconomics and so permit them to exercise their primary functions as Commanclers-in-Chief.3.   Foreign A fairs.Syria.In the realm of foreign affairs a large part of my time has been devoted toSyrian and Lebanese matters andl the intimately connected question of relationswith the Free French in the Middle East. On the 14th July an Armistice was signed with the Vichy French at Fort St. Jean dAcre. General de Gaulle&apos;sdissatisfaction with the terms, coupled with French suspicions in regard to Britishintentions in Sj^ria. led to the conclusion of the so-called Lyttelton-die Gaulleagreements of the 25th July.Having been charged by you with the general direction of affairs in Syria,I arranged for the establishment of a branch of the Spears Mission under mydirection at Beirut in which all political activities were concentrated. My chiefobject has been to secure for the two Levant States the greatest possible measureof independence compatible with our military requirements, while at the sametime maintaining the predominant political position of the French over other european nations. With these objects, acting in close co-operation with GeneralSpears, I participated in a series of negotiations, first with General de gaulle and later with General Catroux, on such varied questions as the repatriation of the Vichy Forces; the settlement of the Druze and Deir-ez-Zor incidents; the declarations of Syrian and Lebanese independence; the supply of wheat to Syriaand the Lebanon; the arrangements for the establishment of etat de siege anddesert control; the construction of the Haifa-Tripoli railway; the elimination ofundesirable ex-Vichy officials, and finally the establishment of British legationsat Beirut and Damascus.On leaving the Middle East I am able to record that relations between theBritish and French authorities in the Levant States have improved immeasurablythough the fundamental difficulty of dual, or rather triple, control under war conditions remains as great as ever. Furthermore, the political situation in thetwo Republics has latterly deteriorated, partly owing to the reluctance of theFrench to make the necessary surrender of powers to the States&apos; Governments,and partly to rising prices, food difficulties, the general nervousness arising out ofthe military set-backs of the Allies and the expectation of a German attack in the spring.
Egypt.From the moment of my arrival I received the greatest assistance from FlisMaiesty&apos;s Ambassador, Sir Miles Lampson, and his staff. Apart from certain economic questions, in which my help was requested by the Embassy, the outstanding event of my stay here has been the political crisis leading to the resignation of the Hussein Sirry Government and the acceptance of a WafdistGovernment by the King under a threat of deposition. The unanimity with&apos;which the decision to use force, if necessary, was taken and the smoothness withwhich the arrangements worked were, I think, in no small measure due to theexistence of the Middle Eastern War Council.Iraq.I had little need to intervene in affairs in Iraq until the latter part of myterm of office here, but I naturally followed with interest the energetic steps taken by Sir K. Cornwallis, through the medium of Nuri el Said Pasha, toeradicate the worst anti-British elements in Iraqi public life. After the trial and condemnation of Rashid Ali and his associates, Nuri Pasha informed us ofhis intention to bring Iraq into the war. This welcome development coincided with a proposal which I had put forward that King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabiashould be invited to take similar action. Some care was therefore needed to ensureagreement between the two parties and proper timing. The negotiations are stillin progress as I leave Egypt.Saudi Arabia.In the autumn I sent an officer, who was on terms of friendship with KingIbn Saud, to visit His Majesty at Riyadh. On his return Colonel de Gauryreported that he had formed the opinion that Ibn Saud would be prepared tojoin the Allies openly. After consulting our representatives in other Moslemterritories I recommended to the Foreign Office that, in view of its propagandaimportance if not its military value, this proposal should be followed up. an approach is about to be made to Ibn Saud by His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Jedda.The intention is that a declaration of war, if made, could take place simultaneously with a declaration by Iraq. Meanwhile the Italian Minister has been removed from Jedda by Ibn Saud at the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Yemen.The Yemen was added to my area in August. I have been little concernedwith this country, but recent threats of insurrection against the Imam have ledme to suggest to the Foreign Office that consideration should be given to thepossibility of cleaning up this last centre of Axis influence in Arabia.Persia.After protracted negotiations the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty was signed on the 29th January. Persia had been added to my jurisdiction a week or two before and I accordingly arranged to pay a visit to Tehran on the 9th February.I was received by the Shah and I met the Prime Minister and leading membersof the Government. I have sent a memorandum to the Foreign Office containingmy preliminary views and recommendations, which are largely of a financial andeconomic character.Arab Federation.The Foreign Secretary^ speech at the Mansion House on the 29th May,followed by the Allied occupation of Syria, led to a revival of suggestions forArab Federation. These came from many quarters and varied from proposalsfor a Great Syria to a more grandiose scheme for a federation of all the Arabnations under the aegis of King Ibn Saud and including an autonomous jewish state. The matter was discussed at a meeting of Ministers during my visit toLondon in September and, as a result, the Middle East (Official) Committee were asked to study the question after consulting His Majesty&apos;s Representative inthe countries concerned. Their report, which has now been received and inwhich I agree, indicates that at the present time no scheme for politicalfederation is possible and that for the moment our efforts must be limited to[23589] B 2
facilitating closer economic co-operation and the removal of economic barriersbetween Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Trans Jordan, and to encouragingcultural contacts between the Arab States. The best way of carrying out these recommendations is now being investigated.French Somaliland.At the time of my arrival in the Middle Last our policy was, by economic pressure and propaganda, to rally Trench Somaliland to the Tree Trench. InAugust 1941, after consultation with General de Gaulle (then in Cairo), Iapproved instructions to the G.O.C., Last Africa, in this sense.It soon became apparent, however, that there was no prospect of Jibutipeaceably joining the Tree Trench, and I obtained your approval to accept the trench Governors surrender if offered to ourselves, even if this meant the exclusion of the Tree Trench from the area. Meanwhile, blockade measures werestrengthened, in the hope of enforcing surrender.In October there were indications that the Governor of Jibuti might he prepared, in return for our lifting the blockade, to concede the use of the port and railway and most of our other requirements provided the Trench flag wererespected. I formed the opinion that our best course was to exploit this Oppor-tunity and seek a compromise settlement, provided that this would not prejudice our general policy towards Vichy Trance. It was subsequently decided, however,to continue the blockade for the time being and await developments. Meanwhile,I was asked to draft terms which would meet our requirements in the event of it being decided to open negotiations. These were prepared in consultation withthe Service authorities and sent home at the end of November.In January 1942, it was decided that, in present circumstances, it would bea sign of weakness to open negotiations. Meanwhile, however, developments inthe Tar East had made it impossible to continue the seaward blockade of Jibuti,and shortly before my return to London I again urged that we had no practicable alternative but to reach some modus vivendi with the existing regime in TrenchSomaliland.Near East Minorities.I have kept myself generally informed of the problems presented by theactivities of the various minorities in the Near East through the medium ofthe Mid-Asiatic Bureau, which was established at the end of July. Of thedifferent populations concerned, the Kurds have been the most active, particularly those in Persian Kurdistan, where a successful revolt against the centralGovernment still gives cause for anxiety. Generally speaking, it has been possibleto do very little with these minorities by personal contact or propaganda, owingto the danger of adverse repercussions on the Turkish and Soviet governments and, to a lesser extent, the Iraqi and Persian Governments.Roman Catholic Church in the Middle East.Italian clerics still occupy most of the key-posts in Palestine. Egypt, theSudan and Ethiopia. In nearly all these territories the Roman Catholic Churchhas&apos; developed Fascist and pro-Axis tendencies, which dominate its spiritualfunctions. For many years it has been a medium of disseminating Fascistpolitical propaganda, and since the war it has lent encouragement to espionage,sabotage and the escape of prisoners of war. After consulting the Middle EasternWar Council I recommended to the Foreign Office that our policy towards the roman Catholic Church in the Middle East should be reviewed and that as a first step a number of leading Italian clerics should be removed and their placestaken by non-enemy nationals. The Foreign Office have now instructed HisMajesty&apos;s Minister to the Holy See to raise this matter with the Vatican.Turkey.Although Turkey is not included in the Minister of State&apos;s area, I have fromthe outset maintained close touch with His Majesty\s Ambassador at Angora.Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen has kept me fully informed of political develop-ments in Turkey, and the Embassy have also collaborated with my Office overnumerous details arising out of the occupation of Syria,. Towards the end ofJuly I received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador a proposal by the TurkishGeneral Staff for the holding of further secret staff conversations. This proposal was welcomed by the Commanders-in-Chief, but the conversations did not take
place, apparently owing to opposition on the part of the Turkish Ministry forForeign Affairs. Subsequent contacts dealing with the furnishing of military assistance to Turkey in case of attack, the supply of war materials and theimprovement of communications, ports and aerodromes, have been pursuedthrough His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and the Service Attaches, all of whom have paid visits to Cairo. All these matters have been the subject of discussion in theDefence Committee.Greece.During my visit to England in September, the King of the Hellenes asked me to enquire into the state of feelings of the Greek community in Egyptregarding which he expressed some anxiety. My enquiries revealed not only that there were serious dissensions among the Greeks here, but that suspicions ofthe intentions of the King and Government were growing in Greece itself.Eeports showed that a real danger existed that, at the end of the war, a pro-British but Republican Government would, by universal consent, beestablished in Greece, and that we should be faced with the invidious alternativesof abandoning the King or imposing his return by force. I represented stronglyand repeatedly to the Foreign Office the necessity of some political concession.The King and the Prime Minister were unwilling to accept the truth of these reports, and over a period of months only made half-hearted and totally inadequate efforts to conciliate Greek public opinion. The volume of evidencehas grown steadily, however, and recently under pressure, from the Foreign Officethey have made several important concessions, notably the cancellation of thedecrees establishing the dictatorial regime and the recognition of the validity ofthe 1911 Constitution. The forthcoming visit of the King and M. Tsouderos tothe Middle East will also help, but the strengthening of the Greek Governmentand the reorganisation of the higher command of the army in the Middle Eastare still badly needed.In view of the appalling food conditions in Greece, I felt constrained to send you a personal telegram on the 9th February urging some relaxation of the totalblockade. As a result, some 8,000 tons of wheat should shortly reach Greece,and I have represented that this consignment should be followed by other suppliesof foodstuffs over the next six months within a limit of 50,000 tons.Arrangements are also being made to evacuate numbers of children from greece to countries willing to receive them. The difficulties are formidable, butthe present developments of the scheme indicate that the attempt should be successful.Yugoslavia.My intervention with the Foreign Office was recently sought by theCommiander-in-Chief, Middle East, in regard to political dissensions among members of the Yugoslav Higher Command. There have for some time beenrumblings of discontent in the Yugoslav forces in the Middle East. After the dismissal of the Yugoslav Chief of Staff and his replacement by a comparativelyjunior officer, this discontent now shows signs of boiling over. -4. Colonies and Mandates.Palestine.I have kept in continuous touch with political developments. The views Ihave formed are contained in a paper which I am circulating to the War Cabinet.Trans Jordan.I visited His ITighness the Amir Abdullah at Amman in September 1941.He and his Prime Minister pressed on me Transjordan&apos;s claim to some constitu-tional advance to match the independence granted to Syria and the Lebanon. Ihave recently endorsed certain proposals submitted by the High Commissioner tomeet this legitimate desire.Cyprus.In the summer of 1941 it seemed likely that Cyprus might be the next objectof the enemy&apos;s attack. I visited the island late in August, in company with theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East Forces, to inspect the defences, and was verysatisfied with the state of preparations. Subsequently I have been able to give the cyprus Government advice and assistance on various defence questions.[23589] b 3
Aden.Aden and the Aden Protectorate were added to my jurisdiction in August1941. They are comparatively remote from the Middle Eastern war, and fewquestions involving my intervention have arisen. The Governor of Aden came to Cairo in November 1941 at my invitation and attended a meeting of the middle eastern War Council.British Somaliland.In September 1941, at the joint request of the Secretaries of State for Warand the Colonies, I investigated the proposed transfer of responsibility forBritish Somaliland back to the Colonial Office which had been approved inprinciple by the War Cabinet in Tebruary 1941. My conclusion was that localconditions did not yet justify replacing the Military Governor (installed on ourreoccupation of the territory) by a civil administration. I have recently advised(January 1942) that the question should be reconsidered in June.5. Occupied Enemy Territory.On my arrival in the Middle East occupied enemy territory was confinedalmost exclusively to the former Italian East Africa, including Ethiopia.Military operations continued around Gondar until November 1941. Britishauthority in these territories derived from military occupation and was inconsequence the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief; Middle East (laterof the Commander-in-Chief, East Africa, when that separate Command was created in October 1941), who exercised his functions through a Chief political officer. Major-General Sir Philip Mitchell. In accordance with my terms ofreference I gave directions that the Chief Political Officer, while remainingresponsible in his military capacity to the Commander-in-Chief, and continuing to correspond direct with the War Office on day-to-day business, should refer tome for guidance on important questions of policy affecting the Italian colonies and our relations with the Emperor of Ethiopia.My objective was that O.E.T.A. should constitute an &quot; associatedDepartment &apos;&apos; under my general supervision on analogous lines to the Intendant-Generaks Department and the subsequently created Directorate of Propaganda.In practice, however, the location of Political Headquarters at Nairobi and thevast distances involved made it extremely difficult for me to exercise useful oreffective control. Moreover, the major political issue for most of the period was the negotiation of our Agreement with the Emperor of Ethiopia, and although I had. discussions on this subject with Sir P. Mitchell in Cairo on several occasions, in the nature of the case decisions on this could only be taken in London,The situation was radically altered by the signature of the EthiopianAgreement (replacing O.E.T.A. there by a British Diplomatic Representative),the reversion of Eritrea to Middle East Command, and the reoccupation of enemy territory in Cyrenaica. A small central political staff has now been set up in cairo to deal with occupied enemy territory in Eritrea and Cyrenaica. I think it important that the main weight in O.E.T.A. should be in the territories themselves and that there should be at the centre no more than a small staff to form a channel of communication between the territories and the Commander-in-Chief and myself.During my visit to London in the autumn of 1941 I raised in Cabinet thequestion of our attitude to the Senussi of Cyrenaica. Their leader, Sayid Idris-el-Senussi, had already expressed to me their desire for political recognition,and I had come to the conclusion that this should be met. As soon as the newLibyan campaign had got under way, the Toreign Secretary announced inParliament (January 1942) our determination that, after the war, the Senussiin Cyrenaica should in no circumstances again come under Italian domination.This declaration has given considerable satisfaction here.Before the offensive in Libya was resumed in November plans were approved for an administrative staff to take over enemy territory as occupied. these arrangements worked smoothly and swiftly in contrast to the improvisations ofthe previous campaign.
6. Pool of Junior Political Officers.At the end of October the Commanders-in-Chief, with my approval, agreedto a proposal under which some twenty young Service Officers were to be with-drawn from their units and employed on political duties. The immediate object was to provide additional British political officers for service in Syria and else-where. Looking further ahead, its object was to build up a cadre of officers whohave practical experience of the Middle East and who can be available for political work in these parts after the war. Some difficulty was felt by the WarOffice in allocating military personnel for this purpose, and it was not until thebeginning of February that approval was finally obtained. Meanwhile a numberof candidates had been interviewed and selected and the scheme is now being brought into force.7. Subversive Activities.When I arrived in July I found S.O. 1 (Propaganda) and S.O. 2 (Sabotage)in a state of chaos. There had been charges of corruption and inefficiency, and neither organisation was trusted by the Services.I called for expert advice, and Sir Frank Nelson came out to report. Certainofficers were removed; Mr. Maxw7ell was appointed Controller of S.O.E. inAugust.S.O. 1, S.O. 2, and G(R) have been amalgamated as the :&apos; Special OperationsExecutive, Middle East and Balkans &quot; under Mr. Maxwell, and a Sub-Committeeof the Defence Committee has been set up to review and direct its activities.Through this Sub-Committee, of which I have been Chairman, it has beenpossible to relate S.O.E. activities closely with the strategical policy and plans of Commanders-in-Chief, to co-ordinate overt and covert propaganda, and toensure that all these are properly related to Government policy.The organisation is now complete, although many items of equipment have yet to be provided, and the Executive is regaining the confidence of the Services.Although S.O.E. has still to show its value by results, I am confident that theorganisation is now sound.8. propaganda.Shortly after my arrival in Cairo I caused an enquiry to be made into theadministration of propaganda in the Middle East. As a result of this enquiryI recommended the immediate appointment of a Director of Propaganda.Mr. O. Tweedy was appointed Director of Propaganda in October, andSir Walter Monckton arrived on the 20th November, 1941, to take charge of ailInformation Services in the Middle East. He took control not only of the directorate of Propaganda which was organised to conduct all the activities forwhich the Ministry of Information is ultimately responsible, but also, with theconsent of the Minister of Economic Warfare, of all S.O.E. propaganda work.The broad lines of propaganda policy are laid down in directives receivedfrom London from P.W.E. and the Ministry of Information. These indications of policy are considered from time to time by the Directorate of Propaganda and area Propaganda Committees, who issue directives to the posts in the field, bothovert and secret, throughout the Middle East. But it has been the aim of theMiddle East Propaganda organisations to leave discretion to the posts them-selves in adapting the directives from London and from Cairo to the needs ofparticular territories. The work of the posts is constantly under reviews and the senior officers concerned with propaganda, at Cairo frequently visit various partsof the territory for which they are responsible.In the last two months the influence of Sir Walter Monckton&apos;s organisation,on the Services has been greatly increased. From the time of his arrival he haspresided over an Inter-Service Propaganda Committee which deals with all the publicity problems affecting the Services.9. Censorship.It was recently decided to attach to my Office a Censorship Adviser with thetask of supervising, under Sir Walter Monckton. the postal and telegraphic asWell as the Press censorship throughout the Middle East. Mr. Willbourne hasbeen appointed to this post and will take up his duties shortly.
Already much has been done to improve the Press Censorship, particularlyin Egypt. The Anglo-Egyptian censorship is, however, very different from the censorship in force in London. Most of the effective censors are British, butthere are Egyptians who hold the nominally key-posts and who insist on a strong-political censorship. There are from time to time complaints from the Presswhich in London could not be ignored, but here a stronger hand is necessary, and less effect can be given to the principle of allowing the Press free expression ofopinion.The local population in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East is. ingeneral, too pusillanimous to be treated&quot; as Anglo-Saxon peoples. Though forthese reasons censorship in the Middle East is rigid and largely unscientific,constant effort is being made to improve the system by doing away with blindcensorship, by providing a twenty-four hours&apos; service and by greater speed andcertainty in the execution of the work.10. Ministry of Economic Warfare.With the approval of the Minister of Economic Warfare, I asked Sir WalterMonckton to report whether it was desirable that an M.E.W. unit should beestablished in Cairo for the Middle East. He eventually decided that no suchunit was needed, but that it wras advisable that a representative of the ministry should investigate the control of trade across the frontiers between Turkey and syria, Iraq and Persia. The Minister agreed, on my recommendation, to appointsuch an officer, and an appointment will be made very shortly.11. Supply.On the departure of the Intendant-General work on civil supplies becamethe responsibility of the Middle East Supply Centre under my direction. At thesame time I made arrangements for the staff of the Centre to be strengthened and brought under the direction of the Supply and Transportation Sub-Committee ofthe Middle Eastern War Council. It is working in close liaison with the Servicesand the U.K.C.C.The supply of cereals remains the greatest individual supply problem withinthe Middle East. Each territory has been encouraged to take all possible actionto stimulate production. The recent measures taken to restrict the cotton acreagein Egypt should increase the planting of cereals.The general standard of consumption of foodstuffs in certain countries hasnot yet been reduced to the level required by war time economy. Action is beingtaken to deal with this.In view of the increasing importance of oil supply, I have recently set up aPetroleum Sub-Committee in Cairo to report on all questions of policy to theSupply and Transportation Sub-Committee of the Middle Eastern War Council.A similar Committee has been set up in Bagdad. Thus, co-operation locally and between the appropriate body in London will be assured.It had been my intention to investigate at an early date one further aspect of the supply problem. At present purchases of supplies on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government are being made by several Departments, and there appearsto be every reason for establishing some form of a Central Purchasing Organisa-tion in the Middle East which would undertake the purchase of all local supplies required by the Services and the various Government Departments. This matter should be studied as soon as possible.12. Shipping and Port Clearance.The turn round of shipping and clearance of ports have steadily improvedwithin the past few months. The quantity of cargo handled through the middle east ports has increased, and there is at present no acute congestion, either ofships or cargo, in any of the ports in Turkey which presents a special problem.In particular, the position at Suez shows a vast improvement, and the UnitedStates flag ships both at. Port Tewfik and Ataka are now being worked muchmore smoothly, although the unavoidable importation of substantial quantities ofcommercial cargo (which has to be cleared to a Customs site in the desert owing tothe destruction of the Customs sheds at. Port Tewfik by enemy action) has causedan accumulation of cargo in the desert dump.
Most of the Middle East ports &quot;could probably handle greater tonnages than are at present being received if clearance facilities could be increased. But the records of the tonnages at present being discharged in the Middle East areencouraging, as shown by the following figures for the months of November,December and Januaiy, viz. :  Tons.November 1941      ............      562,116December 1941       ............      582,081January 1942 .........       ...      533.680If loadings in the Middle East ports are added to the foregoing dischai^gefigures, January in fact shows a slight increase over December in the totaltonnages handled.13. Development of Rearward Areas.The Intendant-General dealt in his reports with the development of communications and workshops in rearward areas. Since his departure, myOffice has continued to be actively concerned to ensure that the three Serviceswork to a common plan and to an agreed scheme of priorities throughout theMiddle East. Special efforts have been made to attain this end in Eritrea, whereall three Services, as well as the Americans and the British Overseas airways corporation have undertakings of importance.I have not yet been able to examine in detail the port and internal transport facilities in Iraq and Iran.14. American Aid.I have been concerned to ensure close co-operation with American repre-sentatives in the Middle East.My contacts with Mr. Bullitt on his several visits to Cairo were frequent andof great value.Liaison between my office and the American Military Mission underBrigadier-General Maxwell has also been close.Consideration of American Aid problems has been assisted by the appoint-ment of an American Aid Sub-Committee of the War Council, over which theIntendant-General and, after his departure, I myself presided.15. Man-power .The question of man-power, which was investigated by the Intendant-General, is now the responsibility of the L.G.A. A special committee has been set up to determine the extent to which it is possible to dilute British personnel in Field Units and in the administration services by the introduction of man-power from other parts of the Empire. It is hoped that a report on thepossibilities will be available shortly.I may mention two further steps which have been taken to achieve someeconomy in white man-power :  (a) An exhaustive enquiry into the establishment of Army administrative staff and services has been carried out by a General Officer appointedby the War Office.  Action is now being taken on his report.(b) My office has been directly concerned in an enquiry of civilian office staff and artisans with the object of setting up machinery to prevent corn-petition for these two classes of labour.Cairo, February 25, 1942.
