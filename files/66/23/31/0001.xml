THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIc&quot;mAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet/ April 1942.SECRET. V Copy No.W.P. (42) 151..4^ 8, 1942.WAR CABINET.JURISDICTION OVER MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES armed forces IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.Joint Memorandum by the Foreign Secretary, the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland.THE arrival of substantial American Forces in the United Kingdom hasmade it urgent to make arrangements for jurisdiction in respect of offences committed by members of those Forces against the criminal law of the UnitedKingdom.2. In the last war the French Government concluded Agreements with HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government whereby British and american courts-martial were allowed to exercise exclusive jurisdiction overmembers of their national Forces in France. The United States Governmentpressed for a similar Agreement in respect of their Forces in the UnitedKingdom, but the war ended before any definite decision had been reached. a defence of the Realm Regulation (No. 45 F.) was, however, passed early in 1918with the concurrence of the United States Government, under which the civil andmilitary authorities of the United Kingdom were empowered to hand over to theAmerican Service authorities for trial by American courts-martial, members oftheir Forces committing any type of offence. It is understood that all Americanoffenders who came into the hands of our authorities were in fact handed overunder this Regulation, The administrative arrangements worked withoutfriction and the United States Government were thus, in practice, granted the exclusive jurisdiction which they claimed.3. The question of jurisdiction over foreign forces in the United Kingdomarose in practical form in the present war when Allied Governments and the remnants of their forces arrived here in the summer of 1940 and the AlliedGovernments set to work with our assistance to reconstitute their forces and to mobilise the man power still available to them. To meet this situation Parlia-ment passed, in August 1940, the Allied Forces Act, which is in general terms and authorises the competent Allied authorities and courts to exercise in respectof members of their own Forces the powers conferred upon them by their nationallaw in matters concerning discipline and internal administration, while reserving the concurrent jurisdiction of the civil courts of the United Kigdom in respect of offences against the law of the United Kingdom. The powers of the Allies&apos; courts-martial are, however, limited in practice by the stipulation, accepted by theAllied Governments in this country, that the offences of murder, manslaughterand rape committed against whomsoever by members of those Allied Forces shallalways be tried by the civil courts of the United Kingdom.4.   When the arrival of American Forces in this country became imminentm November of last year, the American Ambassador raised in general terms with[23672]&apos; &apos; B
the Foreign Secretary the question of jurisdiction as a matter of urgency, and indicated that his Government considered that the arrangements made under theAllied Forces Act of 22nd August, 1940, in respect of jurisdiction over thenational Forces of the Allied Governments temporarily established in thiscountry were unsuitable for the American Forces as they would interfere withthe exercise by United States Commanders of the necessary jurisdiction underAmerican law. The question was at once excimined by the Departments inconsultation with the Attorney-General, further information was obtained through the United States Embassy of the views of the responsible departments in washington, and two exploratory meetings have been held with representativesof the Embassy and of the Commanding Officers of the American Army and NavyForces in this country. Meanwhile, in order to avoid as far as possible an awkward controversy arising with the United States authorities pending adecision of policy by Ministers, the Home Office have advised the police authorities in England and Wales to hand over to the United States service authorities all Americans alleged to have committed offences against our law,except persons alleged to have committed murder, manslaughter or rape againsta victim not a member of the American Forces, in which reserved cases the policehave been asked to refer to the Home Secretary before instituting any proceed-ings. Arrangements have also been made in Scotland and Northern Irelandwith a view to avoiding any immediate difficulty. It is apparent, however, thatthis arrangement can only hold the position temporarily and that a definite decision must now be taken as a matter of long term policy.5. The conversation with the representatives of the .United States fellbroadly under two heads, namely, (i) that of the form of the necessary Britishmeasures to regularise the exercise of jurisdiction by the American courts-martialand to authorise the British civil and military authorities to co-operate, and(ii) the policy to be followed in disposing of offences against the criminal law ofthe United Kingdom where there is concurrent jurisdiction by American courts-martial and our own civil courts.6. As regards (i), the Americans objected at the outset to the applicationto them in any way of the Allied Forces Act, as they considered (largely on amisreading of the Act) that this would be to assimilate their Forces to those ofthe small &quot;refugee&quot; Allied Governments and to subject them to unacceptablerestrictions. They also urged that it would be unacceptable to the United states authorities if any instrument issued by His Majesty&apos;s Government purported toconfer jurisdiction on the American service courts and authorities over american forces in this country. They claimed that they already possessed such juris-diction over all members of their Forces wherever situated outside the UnitedStates, both under their own municipal law and by virtue of International Law.Some time was spent in persuading the American representatives that the objectof any United Kingdom legislation, whether Parliamentary or subordinate, wasnot to confer jurisdiction on the American service courts and authorities, but toensure that our courts and authorities did not interfere with the exercise of jurisdiction by the Americans over their Service personnel. It is unnecessary to pursue this aspect of the matter further, as at the close of the discussions therepresentatives of the United States were brought to appreciate the necessity foran Order in Council under the Allied Forces Act, and were completely satisfied with a draft Order specially worded to meet their susceptibilities and point ofview. This draft, which is annexed, has now been submitted by the american representatives at the discussions to the Officers commanding the United states army and Navy Forces in the United Kingdom, who have expressed their agree-ment and appreciation for the trouble taken to meet their wishes on the questionsof form and ask that the Order may be made as soon as possible to regularise theposition. It is proposed to submit the Order to His Majesty in Council on thenext occasion, without prejudice, of course, to the eventual decision of policy.7. As regards head (ii), paragraph 1 (5) of the Schedule to the draft Orderin Council empowers, but does not require, the arrest and handing over by ourauthorities to the American authorities of American Service personnel alleged to have committed offences against American Service law. The question for decision is now how far this power shall be exercised by our authorities. the americans claim exclusive jurisdiction over men on duty and men &quot; within the
rayon of the fortress,&quot; basing themselves on the following passage fromOppenheim&apos;s International Law .--Whenever armed forces are on foreign territory in the service of their home State, they are considered exterritorial and remain, therefore, under its jurisdiction. A crime committed on foreign territory by a member ofthese forces cannot be punished by the local civil or military authorities, butonly by the commanding officer of the forces or by other authorities of their home State. This rule, however, applies only in case the crime is committed,either within the place where the force is stationed, or in some place wherethe criminal was on duty; it does not apply if, for example, soldiers belongingto a foreign garrison of a fortress leave the rayon of the fortress, not on dutybut for recreation and pleasure, and then and there commit a crime. Thelocal authorities are in that case competent to punish them.&quot;The Americans assert that they have also concurrent jurisdiction over theirmen outside these limits, and they go on to request, but not to claim as of right,complete exclusive jurisdiction over their men everywhere.    The Americanargument in favour of their being allowed complete exclusive jurisdiction even within the field of admitted concurrent jurisdiction runs on these lines.   an american soldier is conscripted and sent overseas against or at least without this will.   The American public will look with jealousy on the treatment whichhe receives while outside his native country, and particularly at any sentencepassed upon him by a foreign court.   American military and naval law extends&quot;discipline&quot; in respect of troops overseas to cover any offence whatsoeveragainst the law of the country where those troops are stationed;  Americandiscipline is severe and condign punishment would be inflicted for any offences against our law.   The American representatives urged, therefore, that in theinterests of good relations between the two countries it would be far better thatBritish courts, and so far as possible British authorities, should not be involvedin the making, prosecution or adjudication of charges against American service personnel.   Moreover, apart from the political agitation and misrepresentationwhich would certainly arise in the United States of America if American soldierswere tried by a British court and subsequently detained in a British prison, they feared that a British court would, for obvious reasons, tend to show undueleniency to American offenders.   The American representatives went on to givea formal assurance that any trial by an American court-martial would be in opencourt, except where security considerations forbade it, and that the trial of an american soldier or sailor who had committed an offence against a member ofthe civilian population would be arranged to take place within a reasonabledistance from the place where the offence had been committed, so as to reassurecivilian opinion;   for example, an American soldier stationed in NorthernIreland, who, when on leave, committed an offence in Southern England, wouldbe tried in the neighbourhood where the crime was committed and not removedto Northern Ireland for the purpose.  Every facility would be given to the british authorities and British public to follow the proceedings and to learn their results,and bearing in mind the common source of British and American law, theAmerican representatives felt strongly that there would be no ground for publicdissatisfaction if their courts-martial were allowed to deal with all offences committed by their Service personnel.  On the other hand, if we insisted on tryingan American soldier or sailor in a British court the United States Government,instead of taking full responsibility for his proper punishment and for meetingany reasonable claim for damages by injured parties, would be bound to assume responsibility for the man&apos;s defence, which might well lead to an awkwardsituation.8. The American argument was put forward by the American representa-tives with great conviction and made a great impression upon the british representatives at the discussions. It is reinforced by practical considerations.It would be extremely difficult to lay down a workable line of demarcation betweenthe cases to be tried by American courts-martial and those to be tried by the criminal courts of the United Kingdom. The expression &quot; on duty &apos;&apos; is one whichit is almost impossible to define. The meaning of the phrase Avas discussedsufficiently far to ascertain that if pursued further we should become involvedin a direct conflict with the Americans. They sketched out a claim that the soldier, from the moment he leaves American shores, isr,continuously pn duty -a
proposition which, if admitted, would result in a complete concession of exclusivejurisdiction to the American courts-martial, and said that if necessary theywould be prepared to issue the necessary orders to this effect. Limitation of jurisdiction by locality &quot; rayon of the fortress &quot; is equally impossible to apply in modern conditions when soldiers may be billeted outside the limits of anydefined camp; and engaged in manoeuvres or in driving army vehicles at greatdistances from it. A third possibility limitation by the character of the offence (which is the basis for the present interim and unilateral arrangement, seeparagraph 4 above) was also discussed, but was rejected by the Americans bothon general grounds and as cutting across their conception of all offences committed on duty being completely reserved to American courts on the principleof extra-territoriality. The drawing of any line would clearly present great difficulties, and if any line is drawn there is a grave danger that friction will arise in considering whether any particular case falls within or without it. Afurther consideration is the difficulty, if not impossibility, which our authorities would encounter if they tried (as they might well have to) to enter an Americancamp to enforce process, or subpoena or question witnesses.9. The American representatives made it clear that their instructions toobtain complete exclusive jurisdiction as a matter of practice were rigid, andit is plain that they could only be altered by reference to very high authority in washington. The position is, therefore, that the interim arrangements described in paragraph 4 will not satisfy the Americans and it is necessary to reach anearly decision on the policy we are to follow. It seems clear that for political as well as practical reasons this policy must be to allow the American ServiceCourts and authorities to deal as widely as possible with their own offenders. Ifthis is accepted the question is whether we should aim at allowing them exclusivejurisdiction or whether we should reserve, on the lines of the present arrangements with the police, certain offences, at any rate for discussion betweenthe British and American authorities. The argument in favour of reservingcertain offences is, of course, the risk that public feeling might be aroused in thiscountry if serious crimes against civilians were not tried in our own courts.This is a matter of opinion, on which all the British authorities so far drawn intothe discussions are not entirely agreed; but we would draw particular attentionto the assurances which the American Service representatives gave to meet publicopinion (see paragraph 8 above).: 10. We feel that the balance of advantage is in favour of letting the americans deal with all offences committed by members of their Forces, as theywere allowed to deal with all such offences in the last war.11. If the Cabinet agree with this view, the question is, how can effect tothis policy best be given? There appear to be the following two broadalternatives :  (i) To make a &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement&quot; with the Americans that, acting under the wide powers conferred upon the British civil and militaryauthorities in Clause 1 (5) of the annexed draft Order in Council, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will take all practicable steps, by means of guidance or instructions to the competent British civil authorities, to hand over all offenders for whatever offences to the american authorities, subject to certain safeguards as to the conduct of the trialin the case of offences against civilians (as already promised by the americans). This course would have the great advantage of avoiding a frontal attack by way of legislation on a very difficult question ofprinciple (i.e., the ousting of the jurisdiction of our civil courts). Itwould also have the considerable political advantage of not ventilatingpublicly at least at the outset the privileged position conferred upon the American Forces by comparison with those of the AlliedV Governments established in this country/There is further theconsideration that a similar gentleman&apos;s agreement worked withoutfriction in the last war. As against these advantages, there is the obvious difficulty that without legislation the central Government inEngland and Wales cannot prevent a private prosecution and have: not. complete control over the local police forces in the matter of/prosecutions, and an extremely awkward situation would arise if a
member of the American Forces had been actually charged with an! offence, or arrested on warrant. The Lord Advocate has made it clearthat without the authority of an Act of Parliament he cannot bind him-self not to prosecute in the Scottish courts a member of the american forces. There is further the risk of criticism in Parliament and thepress and the Government might be accused of giving away in secreta fundamental principle of the Constitution,(ii) To introduce legislation to secure that all American Service offendersare handed over to the American authorities and that after theyhave been so handed over our Courts shall not exercise any jurisdic-tion over them. The advantages of legislation are that it alone canensure a completely water-tight arrangement and avoid the risk ofawkward criticism and complications such as might well arise fromarranging matters ad hoc behind the scenes. The main disadvantage of legislation, apart from the trouble of going to Parliament, is thatit would ventilate a difficult problem, which, as already observed, is complicated by the less favourable arrangements obtaining in thecase of the small Allies. It would be necessary either to put thelatter in the same position as the Americans, which is open to graveobjection in the case of certain of the Allies and would be sure to arouse much criticism in Parliament, or publicly to defend giving a specially favoured position to the United States Forces, which wouldcertainly create some resentment among the Allied Governments inthis country, despite the obvious differences between the situation oftheir forces (which, in fact, depend wholly upon us) and those of theUnited States.12. If it is decided to legislate so as -to enable us to give the Americansthe exclusive jurisdiction they desire, the question of reciprocity will arise. Ourposition would be much easier if we could say that the arrangements would bereciprocal. The legislation could then be in the form of a Bill enabling effectto be given to the reciprocal agreement with the United States Government,which could be scheduled. We should probably have a much easier passage inParliament and we should have a good argument for justifying to the AlliedGovernments in this country the discrimination in favour of the United States.The representatives of the United States Army and Navy at the discussionsstated definitely that their proposal was for an Anglo-American agreementwhereby each country conceded exclusive jurisdiction within its territory to the forces of the other, and seemed to be of opinion that effect could be givento such an agreement in the United States without legislation. The UnitedStates Embassy, on the other hand, are far less sure of this, on account of therights of the individual American States, and it is significant that when asimilar agreement was mooted in the last war the State Department expressed doubts whether it could be enforced in the United States.13. We do not feel that our policy can be made dependent upon reciprocity,as we believe that in the paramount interest of the co-operation of the UnitedStates Government with us in the war we must give them satisfaction as regards their forces in this country. But we suggest that if the Cabinet approves inprinciple the grant to the Americans of exclusive jurisdiction we should informthe United States Ambassador that his Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to conclude an agreement to that effect with the United States Government, but should press as strongly as possible for the agreement to be on a reciprocal basis.We should point out that reciprocity would greatly facilitate the passage of thenecessary legislation through Parliament.: 14. Finally, we would draw attention to the existence of a similar problem in the self-governing Dominions, India, Burma and the Colonial Dependencies.The United States Government will, of course, have to make their own arrange-ments with the Governments of the Dominions concerned, but it is highly desirable that we should keep in touch with the latter, as any marked differencebetween the attitude adopted by them and that of His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom would be most unfortunate. The Governments of Indiaand Burma will be consulted in the matter, but, subject to their views, it isthought unlikely that there would be any difficulty in arranging, preferably by[23672] &apos; c
local legislation (probably in the form of an Ordinance), for the practice finallyadopted in the United Kingdom to be followed in India and in Burma whenoccasion arises.15. As regards the Colonies, the United States Government will certainlywish to enjoy exclusive jurisdiction over their forces; they have not so farspecifically raised the question of the Colonies, but we understand that the governors of certain Colonies where American forces have already arrived have sought urgent guidance from the Colonial Secretary. We understand that theColonial Secretary proposes to provide the necessary immediate machinery by extending to the Colonies the proposed application Order in Council when made(cf., paragraph 6 above). As regards policy, he contemplates that there will beno difficulty in following the line taken in the United Kingdom if the decision in that case should be in favour of granting the Americans exclusive jurisdiction.16. A special case is, however, presented by. Newfoundland and theColonies where military bases have been leased to the United States. Thesituation there is very different from that dealt with in this memorandum;American forces will normally be stationed in well defined areas over a period of99 years, whereas in the case of the United Kingdom and the other territories of the British Empire concerned we must proceed on the basis that the arrange-ments to be made will be limited to the period of the war and the forces concernedmay be serving anywhere in the United Kingdom or other British territories concerned. Jurisdiction in Newfoundland and the Bases Colonies is specificallydealt with in the Bases Agreement (Cmd. 8259) which covers the contingency ofthe United States being at war. The question whether the jurisdiction of theUnited States service courts in these territories is exclusive is a matter of theinterpretation of the Agreement, and this is at present under discussion with theUnited States. It is relevant, however, to observe that the Bases Agreementexpressly gives American Courts the prior right to try members of the UnitedStates forces for all offences committed within the leased areas and certain specified offences committed elsewhere, although whether this applies to courts-martial is a point involved in the current discussion mentioned.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.17. We recommend that the American service Tribunals in this country should be allowed to deal with all offences committed by the American Forces inthe United Kingdom whether or not those offences were committed on duty.(2) Effect could be given to this recommendation either : -(a) by a &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement &quot; whereby British authorities would handover to the American authorities American service personnel whooffend against our laws, or(b) by legislation requiring alh American service offenders to be handed overto the American authorities and providing that after they have been so handed over our courts shall not have any jurisdiction over them.1 The arguments for and against these alternative methods are discussed inparagraph 11 of this memorandum. In our view, the balance of advantage liesoh the side of the legislation.(3) If the Cabinet agree that legislation is the right course, we recommendthat we should do our best to secure reciprocity from the United States in respectof British service personnel in American territory. We do not, however, considerthat our policy should be dependent on securing reciprocity in this matter.&apos; &quot;     - .&apos;       a1, e.H. M.T.  J.April 8, 1942.   \ &apos;  :&quot;
