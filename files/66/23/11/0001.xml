Mr.. Harry,. Guy Bartholomew, Deputy Chairman of the daily Mirro.r,.; and Mr.  C. E.. Thomas,  Editor of the DailyMirror,, saw the Home Secretary in his room .at the HomeOffice at 1.0.15 to-day (Thursday 19th March,  1942) in response to the request of the Secretary of State.Mr.  Bartholomew attended :&apos;.in place of Mr. John Cowley,Chairman&apos; of. the Daily liirror.&apos; : . - -- The Home Secretary was accompanied &quot;by Sir AlexanderMaxwell and Mr.  Osbert/Peake. --The Home Secretary thanked Mr. Bartholomew and -:Mr. Thomas for coming at, such short notice  and said he was afraid that what he had.to say would not sound verypleasant.    He had asked them to come :along &quot;because he wishedto make a statement  to them about the line that the DailyMirror had &quot;been pursuing for some time past.&apos;  The government did not object to criticism and had no wish to interferewith the freedom of the&quot;, press..    Constructive criticism had its value and he and the Government&apos;&apos;were upholders of that.But&apos; there was another kind of criticism, which was sometimesput forward; in the guise of criticism having as its object;the intensification .of the- war effort but was in factsomething.very different,  especially when the country was at war - sneering attacks, mischievous misrepresentations,: irresponsible exaggeration;  the sort of thing that wasinspired by a desire for reckless  sensation.What he wanted to talk to them about-was the general line of the Daily Mirror.    He felt,  and so: did theGovernment because the paper had been studied very closelyand the whole matter had been fully examined-by theGovernment,  that thj people in control of the Daily Mirrorwere ^pursuing a lino of denunciation and vituperation.Nobody could pretend that it was constructive criticism.It was one thing to say that something was wrong,  to givethe facts and point out what was wrong and suggest how itmight be remedied and how similar mistakes might be avoidedin&apos; the&apos; future.    It was another thing to be &apos;recklessly andpersistently condemning everything and everybody.    If theywere/continually misrepresenting events and:denouncing theconduct of the war the cumulative result must be an adverse effect on the public mind, which might lead quite easilyto people wondering whether the national cause was worthfighting for and working for.    It encouraged defeatism andinduced people to believe that if everybody was incompetentand. all was muddle,&apos; it was- usoles-s to attempt to carry onthe war. *    -       , &apos;rHe could, give many illustrations from the pages of the daily Mirror, but he thought it would be enough to mentiontwo which he regarded as. typical of the present line of thepaper.  , He wished to.:;emphasise that he was not singling outSomething &quot;that was a/special, cause; of annoyance.    Theillustrations he would give were typical.    One was a cartoonwhich appeared in the issue of 6th &quot;March.    The cartoon,  avery well drawn piece of work, represented a seaman lying ona raft at sea.    He was clinging to a bit of rope and it was obvious that the poor fellow .was desperate.    The caption was&quot;&apos;The Price of Petrol has boon increased by one penny1&quot; -Official&quot;.
thcWhat was the ordinary reader to make ofHome Secretary said, he did not know what me the cartoonist intended the cartoonSecretary of State) knew what the effect was proportionate cartoon? jning the paner 0rto convey.    But he (thyhim and heimagined it had much the same effect on the average reader,That cartoon meant that seamen were losing their lives sothat somebody might make an additional profit out of the saleof petrol.    He did not see what other meaning it could have.The Home Secretary proceeded to explain that it was quite true that at that time petrol had been increased in-nrice by one penny.    But that increase was.not for the purposeof increasing prof its.    The increase was made with the approvalof the Government wnich had considered the whole question before&apos; agreeing to the increase, and it was not made with theobject of nutting more profits into the pockets of the petrolcombines but because of increased costs in distribution.   he invited Mr. Bartholomew and Mr.. Thomas to consider for a few minutes what.the of feet &apos; of that cartoon might,be on merchant seamen who saw - It.  : The Minister of Labour hadmerchant seamen, who wereresponsibility of seeing thatfor the job, went to sea. . He had powers,merchant seamen did hot have a very goodwas no doubt whatever about that.    They were faced great perils.    If those men were&apos;told,of compulsion.&apos;&quot;onefitThetime at sea; therebrave men and-,as this -cartoontold them,  that they were facing .those perils merely in orderthat greater profits should go to the Combines,, was it not likely that some of them might say- &quot;If that is what it&apos; s forwhy should we go to sea?&quot;    And that way lay defeat,,The second illustration he wished to give was from theleading article published in the Daily Mirror on the same day6th -March. ,;.The article referred to an Army Council Instructicthat had been issued,  and made this comment  :&quot;The.accepted tip.for army, leadership would in plaintruth.be this *-        ......&quot;     &apos; -&quot;All whova spire to mislead others in war should be brass-s   buttoned boneheads:,  socially prejudiced,  arrogant and--fussy.    A tendency to heart- disease, apoplexy,  diabetes-and high blood pressure is desirable in the higher costs&quot;What was that saying?    It was saying that this was the kind olpeople to.-whom leadership had been entrusted.in.the army andthat it-was the desire of the Government, and the authorities who made the appointments,  that only people&apos;of that kind shouoccupy those positions.    It was saying that the army was he indeliberately, filled with hopelessly unhealthy -and incompetentpeople in the higher posts.    If a paper said that kind of thing to soldiers in the army - and he understood they hadreaders there - what,effect did they imagine it would have onthe soldiers?    It must impair the relationship between officeand men and. be calculated to undermine the morale tf the ArAnd- what,,about the effect on their relatives - particularlytheir women folk?   He had tried to imagine how statements;??that kind,  and misrepresentations of the sort conveyed hythecartbon, ever got into the paper.    Surely it was somebody&apos;2business to consider&apos;the contents of each issue.    He suppose&quot;that the paper&apos;would say that it stood for the more vigorousprosecution&apos; of the war.    That did not amount to very much i1they were continually telling their readers that the wholething was -muddle and incompetence.- : The logical end of thatsort of propaganda was hopelessness, defeatism, and afeeliltthere- was no point in going through-with the war.    It therefore constituted the systematie publication of matter
calculated. to foment opposition to the successful prosecution of the war,    He suggested that whatever they might say about their motives, what they were actually doing was printingGoebbelised propaganda,    Dr,  G-oebbels could easily liftthat cartoon and print it exactly as it stood.v   The Home Secretary went on to explain Defence Regulation2D.,    The Regulation gave the Government power to &quot;suppress a paper- which was systematically publishing.matter that was calculated to foment opposition to the successful prosecution of the war,    No doubt, they remembered ^that the Governmentsome time ago took action under the Regulation against &apos; -another.&apos;paper and a weekly news sheet.    They might think thatthere was a great difference between what that other paperdid and what the &apos; - Daily Mirror was&apos;:.doing, and they might think that this Regulation v/as intended more for the othertype .of paper than for theirs.    HO had to tell them that what mattered was -&apos;What was it reasonable to believe would bethe, effect.&apos;of what they were publishing.    The provisions of regulation&apos;; 2D were such that if the effect of publications inthe; Daily..Mirror was in the direction he had indicated,  then.they came within the scope of the Regulation.    It was .not &apos;enough -for them to say that they stood for the more vigorousprosecution of the war.    Regard must be had to the effectof ;the^published mattor, ^and .if the effect was to prejudice the successful prosecution of the.war then the Regulation&apos;applied.    No:doubt they had their: own legal advisers; but what he was telling-them was the view of the Government,  andthe Government had concluded that that was what the regulation ..meant *    The Government had no doubt thatRegulation 2D appl-ied to .publications of the kind he hadquoted&apos;from1 the pages of the Daily Mirror.    If the realintention of a writer -or cartoonist lay in the direction ofsabotaging the war effort,  the things he had cited were goodillustrations of how insidious methods could be used to prejudice the prosecution of the war.&quot; If- somebody wanted to undermine the war effort it could be: &apos;d&apos;one by publishingmatter1 of the-kind he had quoted,&quot; while maintaining that: the motive was the more vigorous prosecution&quot; of the- war, wellknowing that the&apos; effect must be something very different.The Regulation took account of &quot;the effect and -it covered-that kind of case, - &apos; .     -: -. :T-he. Government had. decided that the right-way to dealwith a newspaper&apos;which persistently disregarded the national interest in the way.that the Daily Mirror had done was to use the powers of Regulation 2D - which meant the suppression ofthe paper.    That,  of course,  could have been done,  as they knew,  at any time since the systematic publication occurred.It could be done now.    The Government felt, however, thatthe controllers of the Daily Mirror,   and possibly other papers, might not have realised that Regulation 2D could beused where the injurious effect of the systematic publicationwas unintentional or was coupled with a pro-war policy.    Forthat reason the Government did not propose to suppress thepaper just now.    It was his duty on behalf of the Governmentto explain that the reason he had given was the only one that restrained the Government from taking action at once.But it v/as also his duty to say that if the Daily Mirrorcontinued its present line it was the intention of theGovernment to suppress the paper under the powers of regulation 2D.    If the Government decided that action shouldbe taken,  it would act v/ith decision,  speed and an efficiency
that would astonish them.    He wanted to make it.clear thatthe Government would not wait until a new case for the suppression of the paper had &quot;been built up by a furtherseries of reckless publications..;   The. -systematic publicationrequired by the Regulation t.6.. just if y.c.-action had already taken place.    He wanted them, to- understand- very clearly thatall -that had appeared- in the, Daily Mirror up to now wouldcount...   They need not imagine.:&apos;that- the Government would haveto compile a new: file of objectionable articles beforeanything could be done. , The file, already existed,  and itwould be on. the basis of the ^existing,file and; of anyfurther conduct&apos;of the kind to which he Mad referred that action would &apos;beV taken.    He&apos; did not want any misunderstandingabout that.    In these circumstances if-they did not wish tobe suppressed they would have, to amend their ways at once and be exceedingly careful. J,. &apos; -JThe Home Secretary, concluded by saying that, Mr,Barthomoand Mr. Thomas need not&apos; think that these proceedings wereprivate in the  sense that they were not at liberty to- say anything about them.- &quot;They might,   for example, want to. get in touch with M.P&apos;s about what he had. said -to them and theintimation he had. made that the Government was&apos; ready to talaction against the paper;    he would like them to know thatthey were quite&apos; free- to&quot; do so and that they were .at &apos;liberty to publish what he had said,, if they wished to- do so.    TheGovernment for its part did not intend to regard this as aprivate matter.    A statement would be. made publicly in. theHouse of Commons today.       \ .  .Mr. Bartholomew said that Mr. Cowley,.: the: Chair man of thBoard,- was- sorry that he could not be-present, but he(Mr. Bartholomew) would tell him what, the Home Secretary hasaid,    Mr. Bartholomew added that the only comment he.;wanted to make on what, the Home Secretary had said&quot; was that he hadmisunderstood fhe cartoon.    The Home Secretary&apos;s interprets!of it was not the: papers; it was not-what&quot; they- intended.What they were getting at was.the waste... of petrol.&apos; .&apos;&apos; Largenumbers of poster reproductions of:the cartoon had&apos;beendisplayed at garages and M. T, . Depots --as propaganda&apos;.;againstthe waste of petrol.   ;Did the Home; Secretary want themtaken.down? -    &apos;: .     ..- .&apos;--&apos;- &quot;-&apos;:&apos; ;:&apos;-;The Home Secretary said he was not now going to orderthem to recall the posters, but he thought it would be wiseif they did so.    He did not accept the suggestedinterpretation of the cartoon.
