SPECIAL 3R.AKCU REPORT.The Industrial Bureau of the Communist Party ofGreat Britain held a secret meeting of Party members whoare Trade Union officials, at the Essex Hall, Strand, W.C.during the evening of 10th April. &apos;- About&apos; 45 persons attended.Peter KERRIGAN presided and&apos; the speaker was. HarryPOLL ITT&apos;. -     &apos;- &apos; - &apos;.&quot; - &apos;:&apos;&apos;&quot;: -------: -    - -;      -&apos;&apos;,-;-: - &apos; --&quot;The latter opened by declaring that his., listenerswere fortunate to be the,first persons to hear thedecisions of -  ---recent meeting of the- central Committee,which had&quot;lasted two days and had bean attended by full-time Party organisers from all parts of the country.    Hethen announced that the &quot;Unity for Victory&apos;1 campaign,which ended on 51at March,  1942,  had been the most successful ever undertaken by the Party; membership had reached- a total of 47,900 and the sum of  40,800 had been raised.&quot;&apos;. - It had been decided to depart this year from theusual practice of holding the May Day demonstration inHyde Park, and, instead.,  there-would be a mass meeting atMontagu Place, W.C.1 commencing at 7 p.m.    He added thatthe necessary instructions had been sent to the May DayDemonstration Committee.............. .&quot;;. &quot;POLLITT &apos; then proceeded to expound,the Party&apos;s.attitude towards various topical matters.    In connectionwith&apos;-the-demand &quot;expressed by a number of Liberal and&apos;left-wing1 personalities for a change of Government, hesaid that the &quot;Party could force its policy :upon theGovernment and consequently there was, at the moment, no need to call for changes in its personnel.    Mass pressurehad secured^-the dismissal; of- Captain MARGESSON. and Colonel-M00RE-BRABAZ0N, but the Party did not desire to embarrass the Prime&quot;Minister,  if, by so doing, it would reduce thecountry&apos;s war effort. -&quot; The speaker said he was glad tonotice1 that demoralisation had become apparent within the ranks of the ruling class, and it was up to the CommunistParty to guard against this disease spreading, to.theworking class.. .:.;. -&quot; POLLITT omitted to state upon what data he based his-observations concerning the ruling class, but immediatelyafterwards spoke about the removal of Lord BSAVERBRQOK:-f rom the War Cabinet.    The latter was. a brave and.efficient man, and, with the exception of.&quot; Sir stafford cripps, /the most pro-Soviet member of the.Government.    &quot;Hewas sacked&quot;, POLLITT declared,  &quot;because the big capitalistshated him;    because the Trades Union Congress wanted boget rid -of him,  and because he stood up to the reactionaryoivil servants.    His-removal from office is a defeat forthe progressive forces&quot;.&apos;    POLLITT- concluded his eulogy ofLord BEAVERBR00K bySpaying tribute to . the pro-soviet policy, of the latter&apos;s newspapers,&apos;mentioning particularly the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.    &apos;    ,-r:       Turning to the prosecutionJ.of the war, POLLITT saidthat Party&quot;members- should not underestimate the importance:of the--R.A.F. raids- on factories. in Germany and France,or the. -strategical-value of the Commando raids on theenemy ts&apos;&quot;coasts&quot;.    The attack upon St.. Nazaire was; a-&quot;magnificent piece of ;work&quot; ,   The war situation, however,-was very grave. Britain had suffered staggering losses in the Far East and Hitler was about to strike at egypt and probably elsewhere.
There would be more British setbacks and defeatismmight assume dangerous proportions.    The Party believed. that the- innodiate opening of a second front in europe was Britain&apos;s best policy.    There were generals in theBritish Amy who stated they were prepared to establish and hold a bridgehead in France for the purpose of starting an offensive.    Government spokesmen were tellinglies when they alleged there- was not enough material fora second front in Europe-;    production!.was quite sufficientand such a project would be a wonderful, tonic for factoryworkers and service nen. &apos;/The British people must be made to realise that theywere still net &quot;feeling, the pinch&quot; as some of the Allieswere - thousands of workers en joyed., better meals today incommunal restaurants than they had: ever. eaten in the past and that victory would not be possible until they wereprepared&apos; to wage total war.POLLITT -had little to; say about India.    He wassurprised that Sir Stafford CRIPPS had undertaken theIndian mission in view of some of the terms of theGovernment&apos;s proposals, which were hardly in keeping withthe Views expressed by CRIPPS in the past.    Nevertheless,the Comrunist Party.hoped that a settlement would bereached,  so as te  secure the effective co-operation ofIndia in the war against fascism.Comrades from Cardiff had asked the Party Centrewhat their attitude to the, by-election there should be,and they had been told most emphatically.to supportSir James GRIGG and to do.everything possible to securethe defect of Fenner Brockway, the I.L.PV candidate.BROCKWAY was a mo.st dangerous man and might well polla considerable number -pf votes because he was a seasonedand;5.wily campaigner.&apos; -Now that the membership was swelling so rapidly, theCentral Committee thought that the Party deserved to have more then one representative in Parliament and had there-fore decided to contest;future by-elections, in suitableCeases.    The Political Bureau had been informed of this new policy,- which,  of course, would not affect the Party&apos;ssupport of the.&apos;Government.    ;The speaker- then dealt with, the ban on the &apos;daily worker &apos; - and the Party ! s attitude tdw-a -as Mr. herbert morrison.   -He said &quot;Personal abuse1 ha.., been our stock-in trade for twenty years and has got us nowhere.    Ithas got to stop&quot;. As an example of the harm which resulted from this policy, POLLITT referred to the speechmade by S.O.  DAVIES, M.P.  at the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; Conferenceheld at the Central Hall,. Westminster, on -21st March, 1942Mr.  DAVIES made a bitter&apos;personal attack on Mr. MORRISON,and the following day the Home Secretary wrote to theMiners Federation of Great Britain, asking if Mr.  DAVIEShad voiced the policy of the Union at the   &apos;Daily Worker&apos;Conference.    A ballot was held by the Union executive and it was decided by eleven votes to nine to reply in
the negative.    The outcone of this was that at a subsequentGeneral Council meeting of the Trades Union Congress, theM.F.G.B. votes were cast against a resolution demanding thelifting of the   &quot;Daily Worker&apos; ban.POLLITT said he did not believe that Mr. MORRISON(to whom he occasionally referred as.&quot;Herbert&quot;) was thechief stumbling block to securing the re-appearance of the1 Daily Worker&apos;.    In his opinion,  the Prime Minister wasthe culprit.   -If the Home Secretary were to raise thequestion of removing the pan, he would have only onesupporter in the Cabinet, namely,  Sir Stafford Cripps,The Government held the trump care   so long as the T.U.C.refused to support the demand for the lifting of the ban.It was up to the Party, &quot;therefore, to desist frompersonal attacks upon Labour Party officials,At this point, A.W. MacLAREN interposed with thecomment that personal abuse had been used with good effectagainst Colonel MOORE-BRABAZON and Captain MARGSSSON.POLLITT pointed out that neither of these gentlemen wasa member of the Labour Movement.Before concluding, POLLITT gave the followingaddition information about Communist Party matters.Central Books Ltd. had published 125 different pamphlets,booklets,  etc. during 1941, many of which had reached acirculation of 3,500,000 copies.    Before the end of 1942,.the Party aimed at securing a total membership of100,000,      In the London area alone,  the Party now had 50 full-time, paid revolutionaries  (i.e. membersemployed solely on Party work,  including organisation,propaganda, agitation,  etc., but not routine officework).    POLLITT also announced that the national congress of the Party,  which was to take pla.ee in London on 23rd and24th May, 1942, would more or less coincide with the annual conference of the Labour Party and it was hoped that itwould be possible to arrange for the exchange of fraternalgreetings between the two gatherings.
