l&apos;  kept UNDER LOCK AND key.l\ Is requested that special care may betaken to &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos;ensure the secrecy of this document.IS document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.W.P. (1+2)  12k. V       COPY NO.   &amp;17th march 4 /war cabinet,the press.Report by the Lord President of the Council.At their meeting on the 9th March the War cabinet invited a Committee of.Ministers to consider what steps could be taken to prevent the publication in this country of articles, or the sending out of this country of messages,calculated to undermine public morale at home or to createill-feeling between the United Nations (W.M.(k3) 32ndConclusions, Minute k).I submit on behalf of the Committee the following statement of their conclusions,2, We considered first what steps might be taken toprevent publication of such material in this country.We agreed that it would not be practicable to deal withthis by way of an extension of press censorship.    The presentsystem is a voluntary censorship concerned with statements of fact.    It is designed to prevent the publication of any military information (in the widest sense) likely to be useful to the enemy;    and it has been possible to indicatewith reasonable precision the kind of material which shouldbe submitted for censorship on this ground,,    It would beimpossible, to define the kind of material which mightundermine public morale at home;    and it would be necessaryto require the&apos; whole of each edition of a newspaper to be presented to the censor before it went to print*   This wasin fact the system of censorship employed in France duringthe months immediately before the final collapse of theFrench Government.In our view such a system would be impracticable, as amatter of administration, in this country.    It is also arguable that it would be difficult to reconcile it with the continu-ance of the position by which Ministers are responsible toParliament and their actions can be challenged in the Courts,,3.      We,have,  therefore, considered what other action couldbe taken to check the publication of objectionable material.

In our view it is necessary in the first instance thatthe Government should make it clear that the continuedpublication of this kind of unwarranted and malignantcriticism of those in authority may do the State a mortalinjury by sapping public confidence and breaking dov/n thespirit of unity in prosecuting the.war.    If a general statement on these lines were made, by the highest authority,all members of the Government should follow it up by counteringthis type of criticism, whenever it occurs, by vigorouscorrection and counter-statement.    Above all,  it would be helpful if an example could be made of one of the newspaperswhich has been a flagrant offender in this respect.kc      With this last point in view, we have considered whetherit is necessary to strengthen the existing powers under theDefence Regulations.    Under Regulation 2D, the Home Secretarymay suppress any newspaper if he is satisfied that it hassystematically published matter which is in his opinioncalculated to foment opposition to the prosecution of the war to a successful issue.    We have considered whether it wouldbe possible to take action against the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; underthis Regulation.    We invited the Attorney-General in consulta-tion with the Lord Chancellor to advise whether the wording ofthis Regulation is such that the Home Secretary must haveregard to the motive behind the publication or whether it is sufficient if he is satisfied that the natural consequences of the publication would be to &quot;foment opposition to the prosecution of the war to a successful issue&quot;.    The opinionsgiven by the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General on thispoint are reproduced in the Appendix.*     In view of these opinions, we have no doubt that there. has been in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; systematic publication ofmaterial which would render it liable to suppression underthis Regulation.&apos; 5*      At the same time, we doubt whether it is realised byParliament, Press or public that material of this kind comes within Regulation 2D - which was designed, and is at presentregarded, as an instrument for use rather against positivepropaganda in opposition to the war or in favour of a negotiated peace.If only for this reason, we do not think it would be expedient to take immediate action to suppress the &quot;DailyMirror&quot; under Regulation 2D without previous warning.    Itshould first be made clear that,  in the view of the Government,the systematic publication of irresponsible and malignantcriticism of this kind makes a newspaper liable to be suppressed under this Regulation.    This would serve as a warning, not only to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, but to such othernewspapers as may stand in need of it.6.     We therefore recommend that the Home.Secretary shouldmake a considered statement,  in answer to a parliamentary question, explaining the Government&apos;s view of the publicationof such material and making it clear that it is their intention to act under this Regulation against any newspaperwhich offends in the future*

We also recommend that the Home Secretary should atthe same time send for the Editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; andhim that the paper will be suppressed if the offence isrepeated.-7.     We have also considered what additional restrictions should be placed upon incoming and outgoing messagescalculated to create ill-feeling between the United Nations.We have had in mind, particularly, messages such as thoserecently transmitted to certain Australian and New Zealandpapers by their correspondents in London,There should be no difficulty in applying strictercontrol to outgoing messages by use of the existing censor-ship machinery.    Before this can be done, however, it willbe necessary for a public statement to be made withdrawingprevious Ministerial assurances which have been given tothe effect:-that censorship will be confined to matters affecting military security;    andthat whatever has been published in this country may be cabled abroad without further question,B8      We recommend that the Minister of Information should beauthorised to make a statement in Parliament withdrawingthese assurances and giving warning that in fixture astricter control will be exercised with a view to stoppingoutgoing messages calculated/to create ill-feeling between *the United Nations. &apos;9.      Incoming messages could not be dealt with by means of censorship. Machinery already exists to ensure that suchmessages are brought to the notice of the authorities concerned, who can get in touch with the editor of thepaper with a-view to persuading him to discard or modify the message before publication here.    Censors will be instructed in future to widen the categories of messageswhich they report to the Ministry of Information for thispurpose,,10.    If the arrangements set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 above are approved, Dominion Governments should be informed, inorder that they may consider taking corresponding action.-(Initialled)      JvAoGreat George Street, S.W.1.17th March, 1 9*4-2.

appendix.Note &quot;by the Lord Chancellor.I do not find any difficulty in the words^ca&amp;culatad to&quot;.      In order to satisfy these words it isnot the purpose which the writer had in mind which matters,but the effect which the writer&apos;s words may have on someof those who read them.      It is rather more difficult,I think,  to be sure about the words &quot;foment opposition&quot;.No doubt the newspaper would say that it was fomentingindignation and urging the dismissal of incompetents, allwith a view that the war might be prosecuted to a succesful issue.      But,  speaking for myself, even if the writer saidso, I should not believe him.      Words so outrageouslyviolent as these are clearly calculated to foment oppositionto the war, at any rate in the minds of those who arewar-weary or dejected by our reverses, to say nothing ofQuislings and Fifth Columnists.      Suppose the leader writermet a Fifth Columnist in the train and repeated these wordsto him;    can anybody doubt that he would have fortified the fifth Columnist in his opposition to the war?It is, of course, entirely for the Home Secretary todecide whether he &quot;is satisfied&quot;.      So far as theinterpretation and application of the words of the regulation go, I venture to think that he would be welljustified if he did come to that conclusion.Two questions, of course, would then arise on theSecretary of State&apos;s Order.      First, could the newspapertake effective legal action to recover its freedom?     I donot think it could,, short of establishing in an action thatthe Secretary of State was not satisfied and that the Orderhe had made was,  therefore, ultra vires.The more serious question, of course, is what willbe the effect on the public, on soldiers who read the paper,&apos;on Fleet Street, and on Parliament?     As to this, It seemsto me, if I may say so,  that the suddenness and completenessof the action taken is in its favour.      The newspaper willnot be able in future issues to complain.      Perhaps a memoryfrom the last war may not be quite out of place.     When the then Home Secretary quite illegally suppressed the Globenewspaper because it would go on saying that Lord Kitchenerhad resigned and our Allies in France became greatlydisturbed,  there was a row in the House in one debate inwhich the Government received overwhelming support, andnothing was ever heard of the Globe newspaper again.S.12th March,  1942,

Note &quot;by the Attorney General.The questions raised are (l)  the meaning of&quot;calculated&quot;;    and (2) whether the articles could &quot;be held to he within the words of Regulation 2D.(l)    The word &quot;calculated&quot; does not import the idea ofmotive to the effect which the words would he expected toproduce if believed.      There-is a certain amount&quot;of authority on the word &quot;calculated&quot; in other contexts.      In the NorthCheshire etc.  Company and the Manchester Brewery Company,1899, Appeal Cases 83,  the name of the appellant was -held to be calculated to deceive owing to its similarity to thename of the respondent company, although it was accepted/that the appellant company were innocent and had no intention to deceive.      In Sax Lehner v. . Apollinaris 18971 Ch.  893 at page 900 - a trade-mark case - Kekewich J.stated that no evidence was required to prove the intentionto deceive,  the rule being that a man must be taken to haveintended the reasonable and natural consequences of his acts.(2)    Opposition to the successful prosecution of a war can take two forms:    (a)  that the war and its aims are wrong;(b)  that it is no good going on because it is bound to be lost in the end.      The articles clearly do not come within (a),which in present circumstances is not a form of opposition which-would be put forward.      The only form of oppositionthat is possible and potentially dangerous- is (b).      Theeffect of the article, if believed, would be to undermine the morale of the army and to make the civilian populationbelieve that the army was incapable of fighting the enemywith any chance of success.      The cartoon suggests thatsailors are drowned to enable those who sell potrol to get a penny more for what they sell.      It may be said that any criticism&apos; of the higher command or of inefficiency ofadministration creates some discouragement and therefore. might make people feel doubts as to victory.      It is,however, perfectly plain that criticism can be framedwithout any such implication.      The question, however,whether attacks on the army or the running of the war come within the words depends on their nature.      If they are sufficiently malignant and cannot be read as&apos; exaggerationsof a legitimate line of criticism,  the effect they are calculated to produce may differ in kind from that of reasonable or exaggerated criticism.      The effect then is,or maybe,  if the articles arc believed,  to spread defeatism,which is the only instrument available to those who are opposed to the war.f D.
