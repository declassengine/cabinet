DRAFT TELEGRAM FROM PR I ML MINISTER TO SIR STAFFORD CRIPPS,Personal and Secret,1. War Cabinet and India Committee this morningconsidered your telegrams 859, 860 and 866S.    We entirelyapprove your inviting Azad and Nehru to talk Defencequestion over with you and Commandor-in-Chief and asking them to state their proposals.      We feel however,  thatwe must know what those proposals are before you are inany   way committed to their acceptance.      I must,  as I told you, consult not only the Cabinet but the Ministersabove the line.2,.        Cabinet showed itself disinclined to depart fromthe published, text of the Declaration or to go beyondit in any way      It has made our position plain to theworld and has won general approval,-    We all reachedan agreement on it before you started and it representsour final position.The restatement of paragraph (e)  together with your explanation in paragraph 9 of 859S has made it plain -that, as long as the Commander-in-Chief retains hisposition on the Viceroy&apos;s Council and/his existing controland direction of the defence oP India/ there is no_____________.....----------------------- ^ -Sobjection in principle to the appointment/of a new Indianmember on the Council to co-operate in the sphere ofmilitary organisation.3. If Congress leaders have some better way ofproviding for Indian association with defence, as safeguarded by you in your 859S,  and. if they assure you that subject tothis they are prepared to accept the whole scheme,  thensorne more precise interpretation to meet this outstandingpoint would bo worthy of consideration.      But are yousatisfied that this is the actual position?   Up to thepresent Congress spokesmen appear to have avoided, anything which could, be construed as even a conditional acceptanceof the post-war proposals
