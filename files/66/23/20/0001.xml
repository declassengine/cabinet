(42)-140(Also C.O.S (42) 197)April 2, 1942TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 135)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 March 26th, to0700 April 2nd,1942 ,[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room
COMBINED OPERATIONS.1. On the night of 27th/28th March, an attack on St. Nazaire was madeby a force consisting of ELM. Destroyers A therstone and Tynedale with a numberof M.Ls. and M.T.Bs. and ELM. Destroyer Campbeltown, whose bows had been specially strengthened and filled with explosiye. ELM. Destroyers Brocklesby andCleveland acted in support., The main object was to destroy the gates of the large lock leading to the inner basin, as this lock is the only one on the Atlantic seaboard of&quot; France inwhich the Tirpitz could be docked. The lock lies some three miles up the Loirewhere the river is only a mile broad and the channel itself very narrow. when our forces reached the mouth of the river, searchlights were switched on to themand the last part of their approach had to be made under heavy fire.A diversionary bombing attack was carried out but, owing to heavy cloud,the majority of the aircraft were unable to distinguish their targets.Campbeltovm rammed the lock gates only four minutes behind scheduledtime. Delay fuses were then set and special service troops landed to carryout demolitions in the-dockyard. The pumping station was destroyed but heavy&apos;opposition was encountered and the enemy retained control of the two landingstages which made re-embarkation very difficult. Some of the M.Ls. had previously taken off the Campbeltown&apos;s crew to the destroyers lying in the mouth of the river and the remaining M.Ls. then took off as many troops as could reachthem.During their withdrawal our small craft were subjected fo a heavy fire, andthe four M.Ls. that reached the destroyers were so damaged that they had tobe sunk after their crews&apos; had been taken off.Considerable confusion prevailed among the enemy, who sank one of theirown flak ships and used their guns without any regard for their personnel on the opposite bank.As our forces withdrew a heavy explosion was seen and heard at the timewhen Campbeltown&apos;s charges were due to explode.&apos;In the early morning when clear of the Loire, five German torpedo boats(ships of about 500 tons, mounting one 4-inch and several smaller guns) attackedour forces but retired after a short action with our destroyers.Air escort for the returning force, which was provided by Coastal Command,destroyed a Ju. 88 and damaged a He. 115 for the loss of one Beaufighter andone Blenheim.Four M.Ls. failed to make contact with our destroyers, but made their wayindependently to Falmouth. where they arrived at mid-day of the 29th.Air reconnaissance shows that no trace of the seaward lock gate is nowvisible.Our casualties were : CJb V CLJ.   .      1U1   llilOOlllg.Military : 172 missing, 4 Officers, 13 other ranks wounded.Ten naval small craft have not returned from the operation.NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.2.   An Italian 8-inch cruiser has been sunk in the Mediterranean.A convoy to Russia has been attacked by air, surface craft and U-boats. Inthe course of the attack our forces sank a German destroyer and themselvessuffered some damage. Aircraft have also attacked the harbour and shipping at Murmansk.Two of our submarines have been sunk in a heavy air raid on Malta.Shipping losses are less than of late.Home and Northern Waters.3. An M.G.B. attacked an enemy trawler off Ymuiden on the night of26th/27th and left her sinking and in flames.A convoy to Murmansk, which had been somewhat scattered by heavyweather, was attacked by aircraft off the north of Norway on the night of28th/29th. On the following morning H.M. Cruiser Trinidad, in poor visibilityand frequent snowstorms, engaged three enemy destroyers.   A chase ensued,
aiiH one destroyer was seen to be on fire, but the ships were lost in asnowstorm. Trindad was hit by a torpedo, but reached harbour under her ownsteam. Two Russian destroyers reported engaging a German destroyer about this time, and two hours later H,M. Destroyer Eclipse hotly engaged a stationarydestroyer, until she was forced to break off the action by the arrival of two moreenemy destroyers. Eclipse suffered some above-water damage and two of her fourguns were put out of action.U-boats were reported in the vicinity of the convoy, one of them being attacked by the Minesweeper Gossamer on the 29th, and two ships of the convoywere torpedoed. It is thought that at least six U-boats were operating against this convoy.The majority of the convoy have now safely arrived at Murmansk, but thereare still two stragglers unaccounted for.Two air attacks have been made on the port of Murmansk in the second half of March : there was no damage to ships, but some to the port facilities.Up to the 31st March, 127 British and Allied ships have been escorted to north Russia, of which only four have been lost.Ten Norwegian merchant ships, which were under British charter, attempted to reach the United Kingdom from Gothenburg, which they left on the evening of the 31st. They were attacked off the south of Norway in the afternoon of the1st by air and surface craft, when two were reported sunk, and the majorityreturned to Scandinavian waters. The tanker B. P. Newton (10.324 tons) safelyarrived in the Firth of Forth, but the tanker Rigmor (8,305 tons) was sunk by aircraft when 180 miles east of Aberdeen.Mediterranean.4. On the 24th. seven Spitfires were flown off from FI.M. Aircraft CarrierEagle and safely reached Malta. Two Beauforts and three Blenheims arrived from Gibraltar at the same time.H.M. Submarine Proteus obtained two torpedo hits on a north-bound convoy off Cephalonia on the 29th and two hits oh a merchant ship, also off the west coast of Greece, on the 30th. FI.M. Submarine Urge reported sinking an Italian 8-inch cruiser off Stromboli on the morning of the 1st of April, and on the night of29th/30th she blew up a goods train.Motor launches Nos. 129 and 132, which were on passage from Gibraltar to malta, are overdue and are considered lost.During a heavy air raid on Malta on the 1st April HM. Submarines Pandoraand P. 36 and the Drifter Sunset were sunk and H.M. Submarine Unbeaten andthe Minesweeper A bingdon were damaged. One officer and 33 ratings are missingfrom Pandora.During the week upward of 7,000 tons of French shipping have passed gibraltar eastbound under escort.Pacific,5. An unopposed enemy landing was reported at Christmas Island (south ofJava) during the night of 30th/31st from two transports. It was covered by a force of three light cruisers and four destroyers. The flag-ship was hit by a torpedo from an American submarine.Japanese forces are reported to have occupied Santa Cruz and TucopiaIslands (north of the New Hebrides) and Faisi, south of Bougainville, in theSolomons.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. A Russian submarine reported sinking a U-boat in Vavanger Fjord(Mu rmansk coast) on the night of the 28th/29th. Nine attacks by surface craft,two of them American, have been reported, but in none was there evidence of destruction. A Sunderland aircraft probably destroyed a U-boat north ofSidi Barrani on the 27th. Five other attacks by aircraft, one of them American,were made and of these an attack north of Algiers on the 31st appeared promising.A belated report has been received from the Greek destroyer Aetos of a promising attack carried out west of Colombo on the 14th March.
Enemy Intelligence.German.7. The Tirpitz, Admiral Scheer and Prinz Eugen were sighted at theirberths in Trondheim on the 31st. The Admiral Hipper was under way in thefjord, apparently exercising.Channel Islands.8. Since January the A.A. defences of Jersey and Guernsey have been increased to one Regiment each (i.e., 24 heavy and 60 light A.A. guns) and considerable coastal defences have also been installed. This forms the largestknown concentration of A.A. defences in any part of the German occupied areas.Alderney has also been heavily fortified and has 33 light and 12 heavy A.Aguns.U-boats.9. Activity has been considerable near Cape Hatteras and moderate south ofFreetown and off Liberia. It is estimated that the number of U-boats operating in the Atlantic remains rather below 50.Japanese.10.   There have been no major changes in dispositions.It is possible that the slight lull in Japanese activities in southern Asiaticwaters may be due to the necessity for repairing and refitting of ships after aperiod of intensive activity extending over four months.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 1st April, 1,134 ships, including 267 Allied,and 26 neutral, were convoyed. Six cruisers and anti-aircraft ships, four armed merchant cruisers, 74 destroyers (including 16 American and 2 Russian) and112 sloops, corvettes and minesweepers, were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending28th March totalled 1,006,000 tons compared with 541,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 684,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports 160,700 tons were oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.12. The numbers of ships known to have been successfully attacked duringthe week shows a considerable reduction. U-boats attacked six ships, one of thema tanker; five of these attacks took place in the Western Atlantic and one off thenorth of Norway. Aircraft have damaged or sunk four ships, two off northern and two off Southern Norway.   One ship was sunk by mine off Cromer.British Minelaying.13. Mines have been laid during the week in the&apos; North Sea and in the faroes-Iceland (C) area. There has been considerable minelaying by aircraft offthe German North Sea coast and in the Bay of Biscay area and to a less extent offthe Norwegian Coast.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.14. Enemy minelaying by aircraft was suspected on two nights of the week,off the north-east coast of England and in the Bristol Channel.E-boats were operating off the East Anglian coast on two nights and mayhave laid mines.Seven magnetic and seven acoustic mines have been destroyed during theweek, all of them between Harwich and the Humber.The mine totals now are : Magnetic, 1,931; acoustic, 1,253; and contact, 1,116.Enemy Merchant Shipping.15.   Spanish armed guards have been put on board the German tankers atVigo.
The Italian Honor, 5,303 tons, arrived at Bona (Tunisia) towards the end ofFebruary with her engines damaged by bombs.The German Wartenfels, 6,181 tons, which is at Diego Suarez, Madagascar,is reported to have been loading coffee, graphite, leather and other products.&apos;She was expected to sail soon after 25th March.vichy Merchant Shipping.16. The United States Consul at Dakar has reported that there is no truth in the statement that three army transports sailed recently from Dakar forMadagascar. The Vichy ships which were reported last week to have sailed South from Dakar m convoy are believed to be still in West African ports.American Intelligence.- 17. The third of the new battleships of the &quot;Washington&quot; class, theSouth Dakota, has been commissioned.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this Resume.as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Staraya Russa Sector.  ..18. No further information has been received regarding the encircledportion of the German 16th Army in this area.Central Sector.19. Tierce and confused fighting has taken place in the area west andsouth-west of Rzhev. The town itself is still held by the Germans, who are endeavouring to cut the neck of the Russian salient to the south-west. In theGshatsk area the Russians continue their attacks. Between Yukhnov andZanoznaya the Russians are exerting considerable pressure and their forwardelements have penetrated towards Yelnya. Further south, however, the lineappears to have been withdrawn from the Dyadkovo area and now runs approxi-mately from Kirov to Sukhinichi. In the whole of this area the fighting hasbeen bitter and the situation remains far from clear. A report from Moscow onthe 27th March stated that a marked thaw had been in progress for three dayson the Moscow front and was almost certainly the beginning of the real Spring-thaw.Ukraine.20; Fierce fighting continues from Kharkov to Taganrog, with local Germansuccesses near the former and.indications of a considerable Russian advance fromthe Petrovskaya area towards the Dnyepropetrovsk-Taganrog railway.Summary.21. The Russians are believed to have made some slight progress in their attacks from the Kerch Peninsula. -Comment.&apos;22. During the week heavy fighting has continued on many parts of thefront. In the Central Sector particularly, the Germans are doing their utmost to hold their positions and stave off Russian pincer attacks which, if successful,might force a German withdrawal to the Smolensk area. Meanwhile, the thawappears to be definitely setting in, and this will soon affect the scope of offensive operations in the Southern and Central Sectors.Libya.23. Activity during the week was confined to patrolling by both sides.On the 28th a Tree French column successfully engaged an enemy force,compelling them to withdraw, whilst on the following day another enemy patrolwas shelled by our artillery 10 miles west of Gazala.
Burma.Prome Front.24. On the 29th infantry, supported by our mobile forces, moved down&apos; to attack a large mixed Jap/Burman force which had reached a point 30 miles south of Prome. The town of Paungde was captured by our troops. Inthe meantime, another mixed enemy, force had crossed the Irrawaddy and attacked Shwedaung, 12-15 miles below Prome. Heavy fighting took place andan Indian Frontier Battalion inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, but were unable to dislodge them from their position on the main road.In view of the danger from the west and the possibility of our forces beino-cut off at Paungde, it was decided to withdraw. On the 30th a combined attack from the north and south was launched by us on Shweclaung. After heavy fighting, in which the enemy suffered severe losses, the road was cleared, and bythe 31st our forces had returned to their defended positions near Prome.It is reported that the local population is giving active assistance to theenemy on this front.Toungoo Front.25. Severe fighting in and north of Toungoo has continued throughout theweek. On the 28th Chinese reinforcements launched an attack from the north to relieve the Chinese Division holding out in Toungoo, where the Japanese hadbeen reinforced. Heavy resistance was met and fighting continued for two days,the enemy being gradually pushed back. On the 31st a new Chinese Division had joined forces with the defenders of Toungoo and a fresh line was formed justnorth of the town, with two battalions apparently isolated south-west andsouth-east of it.Intelligence.Italy.26. Information recently received indicates that three new infantry divisions have been formed. This brings the total of Italian divisions identifiedup to 76. In addition, there are reports that a new armoured division is being formed near Rome. New infantry regiments for a further eight divisions exist in embryonic form.Mediterranean A rea.27. There has been a revival of reports of an imminent German attack on Malta, to which the recent intensive air bombardments may be a prelude. It isalso alleged that German parachute troops have been assembled in South Italyand Sicily.   There is, however, no concrete evidence to confirm these statements.AIR SITUATION.General Review.28. lubeck  was heavily and successfully attacked by aircraft of bomber command.Our fighters inflicted numerous casualties during sweeps over occupied territory.The Grand Harbour and aerodromes in Malta were again heavily bombed.United Kingdom.29.   Tighter Command flew 2,301 sorties by- day and, 455 by night.30. Enemy activity against this country was again on a small scale, andconsisted mainly of coastal operations.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.31. Tighter and Bomber Commands despatched 678 and 65 offensive sorties,respectively.
32.   Warehouses and docks at Havre were bombed by Bostons and three hitson a ship are claimed.   The fighter escort destroyed eight enemy aircraft in combat and damaged two, for the loss of two Spitfires.   On the following day..Spitfires (one of which is missing) shot down an enemy fighter, probably destroyed^three more and damaged a further ten.33. Later in the week, after four offensive operations by fighters had failedto stir up opposition, a further sweep at dusk, over Dunkirk-Hardelot,encountered considerable numbers of hostile fighters, 13 of which were destroyed,six more probably destroyed and six damaged; we lost six aircraft but one pilotis safe.Night.34. Bomber Command despatched 668 sorties on offensive operations and afurther 102 sorties on sea-mining. A total of 523 tons of H.E. bombs and57,950 incendiaries (including 827 of 250 lb.) were dropped. The main objectives were industrial targets and communications in West and North-West Germany.35. On the 27th/28th, a raid on Ltibeck was carried out by 186 aircraftunder excellent weather conditions. H.E. bombs totalling1 163 tons (including17 of 4,000 lb.) and 146 tons of incendiaries were dropped with satisfactory results, the latter figure being the highest incendiary tonnage concentrated on a specific target during one raid. Attacks were pressed home from, in some instances, as low as 2,000 feet. A number of photographs taken during the attack show very extensive fires, particularly on the island town and in areasnorth and south of the main station and south-east of the city. Visual observationof individual results was rendered difficult by the glare from these fires. Severeopposition by enemy fighters was encountered en route and 12 of our aircraftdid not return.36. About 61 tons of H.E. bombs were dropped at Havre, where bursts were seen on and near the docks. Hits are claimed on the Ford (Matford) factory atPoissy; these included two with 4,000 lb. bombs and a third fell 20 yards from the target,37. Thirteen bombers failed to return from an attack on railway communi-cations. Reports indicate that a 4,000 lb. bomb burst on the south end of therailway centre at Hanau and that bombs dropped on the railway centre atAschaffenburg caused severe damage to the tracks. The railway bridge over theriver at Mainz is claimed to have been destroyed. Rolling stock at Karlstadtwas set on fire and a number of attacks were made on trains in the area.38. A total of 38 offensive sorties were flown by Fighter Command, including&quot;intruder &quot; patrols and attacks on enemy aerodromes. Oil refineries at Ghentand Ertvelde, and railway targets near Amiens, Lille, Abbeville and Gravelineswere also attacked. In the course of these operations, two enemy aircraft were destroyed in the air, another probably destroyed and a fourth damaged.Coastal Operations.4 39. Coastal Command flew 463 sorties and despatched 103 additional sortieson convoy-escorts. Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command totalled1,064 sorties.40. Attacks on enemy shipping were made by aircraft of Coastal and fighter Commands; no sinkings are claimed, though hits were reported on threevessels, the results of other attacks being unobserved.41. Bomber Command despatched a total of 102 aircraft to lay sea-mines offHeligoland and the Frisian Islands and in the rivers Gironde, Weser and Jade.185 mines were successfully laid.42. Enemy activity against our coastal shipping was negligible. The usualreconnaissances were flown and mine-laying took place on. two nights.
Mediterranean.Libya and Egypt.43. Our fighters continued to carry out offensive sweeps over the forward area, including attacks on landing grounds and camps, and to provide protection for shipping off the coast. In addition, they flew defensive patrols of theAlexandria and Port Said areas.44. Bostons, escorted by Kittyhawks, made three attacks on Martubalanding ground, and Wellingtons attacked Berca and Derna landing grounds.Benghazi Harbour was raided on five occasions by Wellingtons. The quays were hit, a ship was set on fire and mines were laid in the harbour.45. Enemy activity was directed mainly against Tobruk, and the railway line east of Fort Capuzzo. An attack on a troop train resulted in 19 being killed and 69 wounded.   The line was cleared the following morning.M alta.46. Enemy attacks on the Island were again on a heavy scale, involving580 sorties, about half of which were flown on the 31st March and 1st April. TheGrand Harbour and aerodromes were again the main objectives.The attacks on the Grand Harbour have already been reported in the NavalSection.The aerodromes at Luqa and Hal Far were hit, and the latter was rendered unservicable. Eight aircraft were destroyed on the ground and eight others were damaged.   In addition M.T. vehicles were destroyed and barracks damaged.47. During these operations, 21 enemy aircraft were destroyed by fighters and A.A. defences, 13 were probably destroyed and 22 damaged.Italy and Sicily.48. Wellingtons attacked Catania aerodrome, and bursts were observedamong dispersed aircraft.Reconnaissances were made of Reggio Calabria, in Southern Italy, and of aerodromes and harbours in Sicily.Greece.49. Wellingtons from Egypt made an attack with torpedoes on shipping inPatras Roads.   A cargo ship of 8,000 tons was hit.Sea Communications.50. Our aircraft made several reconnaissances of the Sicilian and TunisianCoasts and of the Mediterranean between Greece and Libya.Russia.51. There is again no information of special interest concerning air opera-tions on the Russian Front.Burma.52. It is not possible, from information received, to give details of the daily raids. Prome and Toungoo areas were, however, constantly bombed and machine-gunned. In the former town considerable food stocks were destroyed in one raid.During these attacks eight Japanese aircraft were destroyed, three more probably destroyed and two damaged; three of our fighters were shot clownand eight aircraft destroyed on the ground.53. In the Eastern Shan States, heavy enemy raids took place on the landing grounds at Namsang and Loiwing, some damage being sustained.Pacific Zone.54.

The Nippes railway workshop received very heavy damage, a largefour-bay building being completely destroyed and a shop of six bays at thesouth-east end of the works being extensively damaged. The Franz Clouthrubber works is almost certainly completely destroyed. Damage to civilianproperty consists of two severe high explosive incidents in built-up areas and the block of railway administration offices south-east of the main station has had adirect hit. Part of this building has been demolished and cleared and damagemust undoubtedly have occurred to any premises housed under the adjacentelevated railway track.Hambom. The Thyssen steel works has been damaged in a number of places and damage is also seen to houses east and south-east of the works. The principalfeature comprises the destruction of the roof of the finishing mill over an areaapproximately 100 yards by 40 yards.Kiel. Only part of the town and docks is covered but damage is seen tosheds at Germania and Deutsche Werke Yards, to buildings north of the navalacademy, and there are seven or eight fresh points of damage in the town to domestic property.Emden. A letter dated 3rd March, 1942, states that two merchant ships in the harbour were both severely damaged, one, of about 5,000 tons, heeling over.A new U-boat which was all ready to leave at any moment was destroyed andthree large buildings in the docks levelled to the ground.General. Recent photographs of Kiel show that a liner of the &quot; MonteOlivia &quot; class, of 13,800 tons, has been damaged and is believed to be burnt&apos;out.It is thought that this is the depot ship previously reported to have been hit, andthat she is resting on the bottom on an almost even keel in shallow water.An encouraging sign on the success of recent attacks has been the renewedreceipt of reports from Germany of the effect of our heavy bombs.An informant present in an air raid shelter during the attack on Hamburgon the night of 14th/15th January was struck by the fact that his fellowoccupants were more concerned about whether &quot;an aerial torpedo or mine&quot;might fall than anything else. In fact, on that night one fell, demolishingcompletely 14-15 large houses and damaging over 50 others in the neighbourhood.In the course of this attack the Altona Station and the permanent way outsidewere damaged.In the second case an informant states that the raid on Aachen on)th/8th December was the worst he had experienced, as on that occasion &quot; aerialtorpedoes &apos;&apos; were dropped. One fell in open ground a mile from his house, whichwas rocked by the force of the explosion, All the houses within a radius of about600 yards had their windows smashed, and in the case of houses within 400 yardsfte floors and ceilings completely collapsed.Occupied France.Le Trait. Photographs taken during the attack on 25th March show at least20 bursts in the shipyard. Six of these were direct hits on buildings and one ona small vessel on the building slips.Le Havre.&apos; Photographs taken during the daylight attack on 26th Marchshow bursts on sheds on the Quai du Rhone and other buildings in the neighbour-hood, on the railway lines serving the deep-water quay and adjacent to a merchant vessel of 490 ft., and on the adjoining quay.
