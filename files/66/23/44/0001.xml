There is no change in the position of main units.There are indications that a raider is now in the South Atlantic.U-boats.9. The main concentration has continued to be in the West Atlantic. two-boats, probably Italian, have operated off the north coast of Brazil and one ortwo in the Freetown area. A number have also been operating in Northern Waterson our convoy route to North Russia. The total number based in Northern Norwayis believed to be about 20.*Japanese.10. A Japanese force, including heavy ships, was seen in position 100 miles south of Ceylon on a westerly course on the 15th. Otherwise there has been no evidence of enemy forces in the Indian Ocean other than U-boats.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 15th April, 913 ships, including 238 allied and 22 neutral, have been convoyed. Three cruisers, three anti-aircraft ships,92 destroyers (including 13 American and two Russian) and 105 sloops, corvettesand minesweepers were employed on escort duties.During March, 450 ships have arrived in the United Kingdom in 19 oceanconvoys without loss from enemy action.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending11th April totalled 424,000 tons compared with 606,000 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 629,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Of the week&apos;imports 160,000 tons were oil of various grades. There was, in addition, oneshipload of special Government cargo.Enemy Attack on Trade.12. According to the information at present available 25 ships, including13 tankers, have been attacked by U-boats during the week, 18 in the WestAtlantic and West Indies, four off the north coast of Brazil, two, in convoy fromMurmansk, in the Barents Sea and one off the Liberian coast: of these 15 are known to have been sunk. Three ships have been sunk by Japanese aircraft offCeylon, one ship in the home-bound convoy from Murmansk was bombed and sunk off the North Cape and two ships at Malta and one off Port Said have been seriously damaged by bombs. One ship in a coastal convoy was sunk by- a mineoff Yarmouth.In addition information has now: been received that ten ships were sunk by enemy action and a number of others attacked in the Bay of Bengal during thepreceding week.Shipping losses from enemy action in March, so far reported, were 136 ships totalling 642,014 tons, details of which are given in Appendix I. This includes the loss of 42 tankers totalling 289,000 tons, of which 12 were British,13 American, 11 Dutch, four Norwegian and two Panamanian. This is thehighest monthly figure since the beginning of the war and delayed reports arelikely to increase it. The previous highest figure was 624,000 tons in April 1941*which included the losses incurred during the evacuation from Greece and Crete-
88 ships, totalling 525,851 tons, were sunk by U-boats, mainly off the WestAtlantic seaboard and in the Caribbean Sea. Only five ships were sunk by mines and eight by aircraft attack. The losses shown under other causes include shipsbelieved to have been sunk or captured by the Japanese during the evacuation from the Dutch East Indies. During the month approximately 124,000 tons ofshipping has been seriously damaged by enemy action, of which 74,000 tons were british and 50,000 Allied.British Minelaying.13. During the week mines were laid by surface craft in the East coast barrier, off the Flemish coast, in the Bay of Biscay, and off the southernNorwegian coast. There has also been considerable minelaying by aircraft in the heligoland Bight area.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.14. Minelaying by enemy aircraft on a considerable scale has taken placeon five nights during the week. On some occasions between 30 and 40 aircraft have been employed. Mines were laid off the coast between Cromer and Dover,particularly off Harwich, and may have also been laid off Flamborough Head. -boats were probably minelaying when they were attacked off Lowestoft, as previously reported, on the night of the llth/12th.Mines were also laid in the harbour of Murmansk during a recent air raid.*     22 magnetic and two acoustic mines have been destroyed during the week.The mine totals are 1,088 magnetic, 1,260 acoustic, and 1,116 moored.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this Resume asan inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Lake Ilmen-Lake Seliger Sector.15. That part of the German 16th Army which is beleaguered in the areaaround Staraya Russa continues to receive supplies by air.Central Sector.16. Local Russian attacks and German counter-attacks continue withoutresulting in any noteworthy territorial change.Ukraine,17. North and south of Kursk the front remains quiet, but east of Kharkovthere has been a small German advance.  Elsewhere the situation is unchanged.Crimea.18.   Russian attacks on the Kerch Peninsula have not effected any change.Summary.19. Operations, which are local in character, are probably being impeded bythe thaw. The Russians are attacking wherever possible in an effort to preventthe Germans from disengaging for rest and refitting. In the Crimea there are signs of greater activity.Libya.20. On the 8th April our forward columns attacked parties from the enemycolumns who had advanced and were digging opposite the centre of the front.We captured 165 Italians, including five Officers, and four enemy tanks wereburned out.21. By next day enemy activity had become more pronounced on oursouthern flank, but on the 10th activity decreased.   Since then the enemy has
maintained his positions in the centre, in the areas of Sidi Breghisc and Segnali(39 miles south-east of Mekili), but has withdrawn a little between Bir Temradand the coast and also on the southern flank. Patrol activity on our side hasincreased.On the 13th, three of our columns were in action in the area south-west of&quot;our defensive positions.  We raided an Italian strong point in the Segnali area,inflicting casualties without loss to ourselves.The following day an enemy force including tanks and self-propelled gunsattacked one of our forward columns six miles east of Eluet el Aggara. Weknocked out two enemy tanks and damaged five others but one of our &quot; I &quot; tankswas knocked out and five further tanks and three anti-tank guns are missing.The main enemy M.T. concentration is now in the area seven miles north ofSegnali.Burma.Irrawaddy Front.22. On the 9th our forces withdrew northwards, covering the line of theroad Magwe-Taungwingyi-Satthwa.On the 10th two enemy columns moved up from Prome towards Satthwa andthe village of Migyaungye. Contact was made next day and heavy fightingensued.  Further south a third column was reported at Sinbaungwe.Early on the 13th the enemy captured Migyaungye with strong pressure alonga wide front, which caused a wide gap between this front and our forces atTaungwingyi who maintained their positions to protect the Chinese right flank.On the 14th enemy infiltration threatened to outflank our Irrawaddy positionthrough this gap but by the 16th we had established a position astride theYinchaung.Sittang Front.23. After a lull on this front on the 11th and 12th, the Japanese stronglyattacked the Chinese at Swa. The latter suffered about 1,200 casualties and were forced to withdraw some five miles up the main road to Thagaya. On the 14thsevere fighting took place at Thagaya and the Chinese estimate casualties at three to one in their favour.To the east, an enemy column reached Mawchi on the 9th, and on the 14thfighting was reported further east between Kemapyu and Pazang with heavy casualties on both sides. The Chinese are now in a position further north six miles south of Bawlake. A small enemy party approaching from the west got astride the Bawlake-Loikaw Road on the evening of the 13th, but was wiped out.Netherlands East Indies.24. Dutch refugees from Celebes report that on 17th March the japanese were holding Macassar, Pare Pare, Palopa and Kendari, but not in any greatforce.New Guinea Area.25. Japanese forces (estimated at 300-500) landed at Lorungau (ManusIsland) on 7th April.One of our patrols reports that the Japanese have not penetrated more than two miles up the Markham Valley (Lae).Solomon Islands.26. On 13th April it was reported that there were 100 Japanese on Faisiand Lofang Islands (Bougainville Straits).Australia,27. - President Roosevelt stated on 8th April that there were 63,000 american troops in Australia.
Intelligence.France and the Low Countries.28. There are signs that, since the raid on St. Nazaire, the Germans have become increasingly preoccupied with coastal defences, particularly in south-westFrance whence a number of defensive precautions have been reported. A furtherdivision is believed to have been transferred from France to Russia. Theestimated total of divisions is now 25 in France and three m the Low Countries.Norway and Denmark.29. Fresh evidence has been received of a movement of troops and storesfrom Germany to Norway. There is nothing to indicate, however, that the rein-forcements are for other than defensive purposes and the estimated total ofGerman divisions in Norway remains at eight, with two more in Denmark.AIR SITUATION.General Review.30.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports. iThe following reports of damage have been received during the past weekGermany.Lubeck.-Photographs taken on 12th April, 1942, reveal that approximately45 per cent, to 50 per cent, of the city has been totally destroyed (this does not include the suburbs). The following constitute the chief points of majordamage : Most of the damage appears to have been done by fire, although there is evidence of a number of direct hits by H.E., including probable 4,000-lb.incidents.Among the important buildings seen destroyed or very severely damagedare the Cathedral, the Cathedral Museum, the Reichsbank, the Central ElectricStation, the Stadt Halle and a number of churches. The Main Railway Station(at Lorenz) has suffered some damage from fire.In the residential suburb of Lorenz, in the neighbourhood of the main railway Station, there has been a very large amount of total destruction by fireto houses in a fully built-up area.Severe damage has occurred to warehouses in the harbour and railway stationto the north-west.A transport firm who usually routed their goods through Lubeck have beeninformed by their agents that they are unable to handle any further goodsdespatched and these should be diverted to Bremen or Hamburg.Cologne. The raid on 5th/6th April was more severe than that of 13th/14thMarch. The greater part of the Rhine harbour was destroyed together with therailway approaches thereto. It is said that the debris in this district will take some weeks to clear. In addition over 400 buildings suffered varying degrees of damage.Occupied France.Poissy: Matford Works. Photographs taken on 10th April, 1942, show thatthese works have been seriously damaged both by fire and H.E. The damage is confined almost entirely to the target and factories immediately to the south andsouth-west, although there are a few incidents of damage to residential property in the district.   The outstanding points of damage are as follows:- Parts of the assembly, presses, spraying, enamelling, bodywork and upholsteryshops have been severely damaged by fire and blast.The offices have been hit at the south-west end, and discolouration by fire orblast is evident over the whole length.A heavy bomb, possibly 4,000 lb., has fallen on the machine-tool workshops,the roof having been destroyed over an area about 160 ft. square. Very serious damage to the interior of the workshops has undoubtedly been caused by blastThe store for raw materials and half-finished parts has been hit at the south-west end.A near miss has destroyed approximately 55 ft. of the wall bordering thetransformers on the north-east side.Though damage to the transformers cannot be confirmed from the photo-graphs, it is almost certain that they will have sustained damage from blast orflying debris.Two blocks of workmen&apos;s dwellings have been totally destroyed.Shed-type buildings to the north-east of the main building have been damaged.There is little doubt that the Matford Works has been very seriously damaged, although it is not possible at this stage to say definitely that the works will be permanently out. of commission. A number of factories near the mainworks have been hit, but as they have not yet been identified it is not possible to assess the effect of the damage caused.
