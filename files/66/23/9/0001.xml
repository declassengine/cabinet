naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   An Italian U-boat has been sunk in the Mediterranean.H.M. Destroyer Vortigern has been sunk by E-boats.Shipping losses, principally due to U-boat attacks in the West Atlantic, havebeen heavy.Northern Waters.2. On the 12th the Russian Submarine 402 was damaged by depth chargesnorth of Murmansk.H.M. Trawler Stefa shot down a Ju. 88 off the Murmansk coast on the 13th.Home Waters.3. A large enemy merchant ship, heavily escorted, passed down Channelearly on the morning of the 14th. An attack by Dover coastal craft was beatenoff. Later five of our destroyers attacked with torpedoes, one of which probablyhit the merchant ship. Two E-boats were probably sunk and a destroyer hit by gunfire. Three of our destroyers sustained superficial damage, but no casualties.Subsequently the enemy force was reported in Havre.During the night of the 14th/15th two convoys off the East coast wereunsuccessfully attacked by E-boats, one of which was probably sunk and anotherdamaged. H.M. Destroyer Vortigern, escorting one of the convoys, was sunk:three officers and seven ratings were rescued.On the morning of the 15th three M.G.Bs. off Ijmuiden attacked and sank an E-boat; ten prisoners were captured. Later an engagement took place withfour E-boats, one of which was seriously damaged. M.G.Bs. sustained above-water damage and six casualties. Subsequently our aircraft located the E-boats,setting one on fire and damaging the remainder.On the evening of the 14th an enemy aircraft, which was attacking a convoyin the Bristol Channel, was shot down by the Polish Destroyer Kujawiak.H.M. Destroyer Windsor was slightly damaged in collision off the East coaston the 16th.Some typical examples of the performance of H.M. ships are given inAppendix A.Mediterranean.4. On the 6th March H.M. Submarine P. 31 torpedoed and sank a 7,000-tonsouth-bound merchant ship, escorted by two destroyers, off the Tunisian coast.P. 31 sustained minor damage during a counter-attack.During the night of the 14th/15th light naval forces, in co-operation withthe R.A.F., bombarded the port and shipping in the harbour of Rhodes.During the week 22,157 tons of French shipping east bound and 21.641 tonswest bound have passed through the Straits of Gibraltar under escort.tSouth Atlantic.5. On the 12th, 300 miles south of Cape Verde-Islands, H.M.S. PretoriaCastle (Armed Merchant Cruiser) intercepted the Spanish s.s. Monte Gorbea(3,720 tons), which was taken into Bathurst for examination. The&apos; german ambassador to the Argentine was taking passage in the Monte Gorbea.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. H.M. Submarine P. 34 sank the Italian U-boat Admiral Millo (1,500tons) 100 miles south-east of the Straits of Messina on the 16th. Some survivorswere rescued. Surface craft have attacked U-boats off the west coast of Ireland,to the west of Lisbon and off Vancouver Island.An American aircraft made a promising attack south-east of St. John&apos;s,Newfoundland. Three attacks by our aircraft were carried out in the North-Western Approaches, but, although hits were claimed, in no instance was thereevidence of destruction.
Enemy Intelligence.7.   The Ti?yitz has been located at Trondheim.On the 15th five destroyers were reported north bound off the Skaw.U-Boats.&apos; 8. The main concentration has continued to be in the Western Atlantic and caribbean Sea. Others have been operating in the North-Western Approaches,off the east coast of Iceland (C) and off the Liberian coast.Japanese.9. The main fleet is presumed to be in home waters. Nearly all its cruisers and light craft have been detached to other areas. The Southern Fleet is nowconcentrated on northern Sumatra, and there is a naval force which isconsolidating the various bases established or taken over in the Java Sea area.The only unit known to be operating in the Philippine area is one flotilla of four destroyers. The operations in New Guinea are being carried out by theFourth Fleet, whose strength, with reinforcements from the main fleet, isestimated to be : four 8-inch cruisers, two 6-inch cruisers, two 5-5-inch cruisers,three seaplane carriers, two aircraft carriers, eight destroyers and ninesubmarines.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending 18th March 887 ships, including 181 allied and 16 neutral, were convoyed. Six anti-aircraft ships, four ocean boardingvessels, 77 destroyers (including 16 American destroyers) and 102 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties. During the month of February 3,848ships were convoyed, of which eight were lost by enemy action. Since thebeginning of the war 510 ships have been lost out of 107,453 ships which havebeen convoyed.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending march totalled 332,000 tons compared with 627,000 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 616,000 tons for the past ten weeks.   Of the week&apos;imports, ,132,000 tons were oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Trade.11. According to the information at present available 22 ships, including11 tankers, have been attacked by U-boats during the week, 20 in the WestAtlantic and West Indies, one off the Liberian coast and one off Madras; of these11 are known to have been sunk. Two ships were mined off Aberdeen andAldeburgh respectively, and one snip was sunk, probably by a mine, off Capetown.One ship was bombed and sunk off the Portuguese coast, and one Dutch ship isknown to have been seized by the Japanese in Batavia.British Minelaying.12. During the week mines have been laid by surface craft in the Faroes-Iceland (C) area, in the East coast Barrier and off the Dutch and Belgian coasts.Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out off the German North Sea coast and in the Mediterranean off Benghazi and Tripoli (L).Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. Minelaying by enemy aircraft took place on two nights of the week offthe East Coast between Lowestoft and the Thames Estuary and in the bristol channel.   E-boats were operating on one night off the Norfolk coast.Twelve magnetic and three acoustic mines have been destroyed during theweek.  The mine totals now are : 1,903 magnetic, 1,246 acoustic and 1,116 contact.Foreign Waters.14.   On two nights of the week E-boats laid mines off Valetta (Malta).A submerged mine was reported off Capetown on the 17th and a dangerousarea has been declared.A drifting mine has been reported off Sydney, New South Wales.[23594] ls
Enemy Merchant Shipping,15. Between the 10th and the 27th January the Russians claim to have sunkfour German merchant ships, totalling 4,000 tons, and to have damaged eightothers in Northern waters.The Italian s.s. Calitea (4,013 tons) has been sunk.The German s.s. Tacoma (8,268 tons), which has been interned atMontevideo, has now been seized by the Government of Uruguay.vlCiiy intelligence.Madagascar.16. The following ships were recently seen at Diego Suarez by air recon-naissance : Three submarines (one in dry dock), sloop d&apos;Iberville, the armed merchant Cruiser Bougainville, the naval tanker Elorn, one Greek and two italian merchant ships. The s.s. Conde (7,202 tons) is reported to have left Dakarat the end of February for Madagascar. The Armed Merchant Cruiser Quercyarrived at Tamatave on the 12th February from Dakar. On the 12th March it was estimated that there were six or seven submarines at Madagascar, but all ofthem were not based there.vichy Merchant Shipping.17. It has been announced that the s.s. Ste. Marcelle (1,518 tons, ex Nor-wegian s.s. Vigor) was torpedoed in the Mediterranean on the 14th March, andthat two of the crew are missing. This ship has been engaged in trading betweenMarseilles and Tunis, and is known to have carried Italian lorries and provisions for troops in Libya.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this Resume asinset.)Lake Ilmen-Lake Seliger Sector.18. - In the Staraya Russa sector operations against the encircled portionof the German 16th Army are reported to be progressing satisfactorily, despitestrong German resistance and difficult snow conditions.Central Sector.19. There has been little change, but much heavy fighting has taken place,particularly in the following areas : &apos;(1) West and south-west of Rzhev, where the situation is still confused.(2) North-east of Gshatsk, where the Russians have again been attacking.(3) South of Vyasma, where the Germans have apparently prevented the. Russian main forces from joining up with the parachute troops atDorogobuzh and from cutting the German communications fromVyasma to Smolensk.(4) On a wide front south-west of Yukhnov.Ukraine.20. There has been heavy fighting from Kharkov to Taganrog. TheRussians have had some success in the Kharkov area.Crimea.21. The Russians have again made heavy attacks in the Kerch Peninsulaand have made some slight progress.Summary.22. The Russian efforts to destroy the encircled German forces in the StarayaRussa area continue.   On many other sectors the Russians are exerting great
pressure under difficult conditions, and losses are likely to have been considerableon both sides. Although territorial gains have been negligible, it is important that the Germans have been given little respite.Libya.23.   No change in the situation has taken place.Patrolling on both sides has been active, particularly on the 16th March,when an enemy force of about a company of infantry, with artillery, advancedsome 15 miles into no-man&apos;s land south of Tmimi. On the same day some 30 enemytanks and a number of M.T. vehicles were located in the vicinity of Guerat elMogaregh, 34 miles east of Mekili. By the 17th, however, the enemy&apos;s columnshad withdrawn and activity had reverted to normal.Burma.24. On the 11th March our forces in the Nyaunglebin area captured threevillages, including Shwegyin. This limited offensive was carried out with aview to creating a diversion while our main forces withdrew north of Rangoon.In capturing these villages heavy casualties were inflicted on the enemy. our troops in this area have now withdrawn to their former positions, according to plan, and a line has been stabilised running approximately east and west from north of Shwegyin to north of Tharrawaddy.G.O.C., Burma, has organised an Irrawaddy River Patrol from Henzada tothe south, and an intelligence system of loyal local inhabitants has been instituted.Army Headquarters are at Maynryo.25. Chinese forces stationed on the Southern Shan States-Thailand frontierhave been in contact with Thais, and in one engagement a hundred of the latter were killed.26. There are indications that the Japanese are attempting an advance upthe Toungoo road and enemy concentrations are reported at Letpadan andTaikkyi.Intelligence.Norway and Denmark.27. There have been further indications that the foreshadowed strength-ening of the coastal defences of Norway has begun. Reports have been received of reinforcements to South and South-West Norway via Oslo, and it seems likely that from five to ten new Coast Defence Battalions (i.e., probably 3,500-7,000men) may be involved. There have been no reports suggesting the arrival of any fresh formations in Norway, and the reinforcements appear to represent merelya strengthening of those divisions already responsible for coast defence. Thetotal number of divisions in Norway remains, therefore, at eight.Reports of reinforcements to Denmark are conflicting, and until more satisfactory evidence is obtained the estimate of two divisions there must bemaintained.AIR SITUATION.General Review.28.   Although in general weather conditions severely restricted night bombing operations, successful attacks were made on Cologne and Kiel.Aerodromes at Malta were again heavily bombed.United Kingdom.29.   Fighter Command flew 1,844 sorties by day and 210 by night.30.   Enemy activity against this country was again on a small scale, althoughlarger than in recent weeks, and consisted mainly of coastal operations.[23594] r 2
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.31. A total of 490 sorties were despatched by Fighter Command on offensive operations and 29 were flown by Bomber Command.32. Eleven Bostons carried out a successful raid on the Railway centre at Hazebrouck, and a number of hits were made on the target. Other bombers were despatched to attack enemy shipping off the French Coast, but owing topoor visibility they failed to locate their targets.33. Thirty-six squadrons of fighters provided support for these operations,during which they shot down 18 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed8 others, for the loss of seven Spitfires. All the bombers returned safely. Theenemy flew a considerable number of patrols over the Calais and Dieppe areas,when our offensive operations were in progress, otherwise German fighters were used with great economy.34. Small offensive raids were carried out by Spitfires against a number of targets including the dock area at Le Treport, Le Touquet aerodrome, gun posts,barges and five trains. In addition, two E-boats and a minesweeper were set on fire, and three other E-boats damaged.Night.35. Bomber Command despatched a total of 327 sorties against enemytargets and released 273 tons of H.E. bombs. Owing to very unfavourable weatherit was possible to operate on only two nights of the week. Twenty-six aircraft were employed on sea mining as recorded under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;36. The heaviest attack wasi .madg; :agamst Cologne, when nearly 100 tonsof H.E. bombs&apos;and&quot;abouT 25,000 incendiaries (including&apos; 186 of 250 lbs.) were released. Bursts were observed in the area of the Ffindenburg Bridge, and manylarge fires were reported, one of which appeared to involve a whole street. Onlyone aircraft was missing from this attack.37. Eighty-four tons of bombs were released at Kiel in conditions of goodvisibility, but accurate identification of targets within the area was difficult onaccount of intense flak and searchlight glare. Large fires were seen in the centre of Kiel and bursts were observed in the Deutsche Werke Shipbuilding Yards andin the dock area.Attacks on a smaller scale were made on Emden, Boulogne and Dunkirk.Coastal Operations.38. Coastal Command despatched 288 sorties, of which 50 sorties were onconvoy escorts. Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 992sorties.39. Bomber Command despatched a total of 26 aircraft to lay sea-mines inthe mouth of the Jade and Weser Rivers, off Heligoland and off the frisian islands.40. Enemy activity by day consisted principally of shipping and weatherreconnaissances. An extensive reconnaissance was made of Ireland. Nightactivity consisted almost entirely of anti-shipping and minelaying operations overthe North Sea and, to a lesser extent, the South Western Approaches.Mediterranean.Libya and Egypt.41. Our fighters carried out a number of offensive sweeps over the forward area and provided protection for shipping off the coast.42. Martuba landing ground was heavily attacked three times by Bostons,escorted by Kittyhawks.&apos; Five enemy aircraft on the ground Were destroyed anddumps were set on fire. The Kittyhawks, two of which are missing, shot downthree enemy fighters and probably destroyed two others.
Wellingtons bombed a concentration of M.T. near Mekili, causing largeexplosions among vehicles, and Blenheims attacked M.T. between El Agheila andJedabya.  Small-scale attacks were made on Tripoli (L) and Benghazi Harbours.43. Enemy activity was directed mainly against Tobruk, but no damage has been reported. Me. 109s continued to be employed on bombing and machine-gun attacks on our forward landing grounds.Malta.44. The Island was again heavily raided throughout the week by a totalof at least 550 aircraft. The aerodromes and seaplane and submarine bases werethe main objectives. Graters were caused on the aerodromes, several aircraft onthe ground were destroyed and others were damaged. At Takali the administra-tive buildings and stores were seriously damaged, and at Hal Far a hangar was destroyed.45. Although our fighters were hampered by the partial unserviceabilityof the aerodromes, they shot down three enemy aircraft and damaged 23. two other aircraft were destroyed by our A.A. defences.Italy and Sicily.46. Wellingtons which were unable, owing to bad visibility, to locate Cataniaaerodrome attacked flak concentrations in the vicinity.Reconnaissances were made of aerodromes and harbours in Sicily.Greece, Crete and the Dodecanese.47. Wellingtons from Egypt bombed Tymbaki aerodrome in Crete and the docks at the Piraeus, where fires were started.The aerodromes at Calato and Maritza, in Rhodes, and at Heraklion, inCrete, were attacked by Wellingtons, in support of the naval operations referredto in paragraph 4.Sea Communications.48. Naval aircraft made a torpedo attack on a northbound merchant vessel of 7,000 tons south of Lampedusa, and also on an eastbound merchant vessel of2,000 tons east of Tripoli (L). Both vessels were hit and the smaller one was seton fire.Several reconnaissances of the Tunisian and Libyan coasts were made by our aircraft.Russia.49. There has been no important change in the air situation on the russian front. &quot; -Burma.50. Blenheims carried out reconnaissances in support of our ground forces,and attacked enemy M.T. and vehicles loaded with troops, between Mingaladonand Hmawbi. Fighters carried out small sweeps but encountered very littleenemy opposition.51. Enemy air activity during the week was on a small scale, and a recon-naissance over Mingaladon aerodrome on the 13th showed that the enemy hadnot, so far, established any aircraft there. It is reported that the enemy heavily bombed Nyaunglebin shortly after the withdrawal of our troops.Pacific Zone.52. Reconnaissance of Salamoa and Lae (New Guinea) disclosed thepresence of two cruisers, two destroyers and a number of transports. enemy fighters were also seen to be operating from the aerodrome. American heavycombers were despatched to attack this force, and scored near misses on a ship.
Buildings and a hangar at Salamoa were destroyed in this attack, and an enemy aircraft was shot down.53. Vunakanau aerodrome (Rabaul) was bombed by one heavy bomber anda direct hit made on an enemy aircraft, while two others were probably destroyed.Thirteen vessels (probably cruisers and destroyers) were observed in the harbour.54. Three enemy attacks were made on Port Moresby by a total of 21 heavy bombers and five fighters. A number of hits were made on the runway, but the aerodrome was not rendered unserviceable.Australia.55. Eight bombers and nine T.O. fighters took part in a raid on HornIsland (near Thursday Island) and destroyed one Hudson on the ground. Oneof the bombers and two fighters were shot down, and one American fighter is missing.The aerodrome at Port Darwin was attacked by 14 heavy bombers and con-siderable damage was caused to buildings.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.56&apos; During daylight on the 18th two bombs fell in Torquay harbour, causingslight blast damage.On the night 13th/14th some damage was caused to military barracks atFolkestone. On this night, too, small incidents occurred in Lincolnshire and thefollowing night in Cornwall, with some machine-gun fire at Hugh Town, ScillyIslands.Casualties.57. There were no civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 on the18th March.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from Air Reconnaissance and Intelligence sources :  Germany.1. Huts. This target was attacked on the 28th/29th December, and ampletime has elapsed for repairs to have been carried out. Photographs taken on the9th March, 1942, however, show that the plant is not as active as might havebeen expected, several cooling towers not being in operation. In addition, fivegas holders, probably destroyed during the attack have been removed. Newpipe-lines are being constructed, and there is reason to believe that repairs havebeen carried out to the roofs of buildings in the works.2. Kiel. In the attack on the 27th/28th February a large ship used as adepot ship was hit and &quot;sank.Occupied France.3. Poissy.-Photographs taken during the attack on the 8th March, 1942,on the Matford Works at Poissy show that seven direct hits were obtained onthe main factory building, one on a subsidiary building and four amongst parkedlorries.
