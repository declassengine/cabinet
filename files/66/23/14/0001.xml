As most of thedoubtful cases are ships last heard of in the Netherlands east indies, the actual losses will probably not fall far Short of600*000 gross tons 8     of the total, rather more than one halfconsists of vessels whioh were previously engaged in tradingsolely in the Indian and pacific Oceans.lieMinistry of War Transport*.TH&quot;ii-nfiii.ifiriiii&quot;iriiiil Ifm     urn mi ,i .11111,1.&apos; m*mmm 1      &quot;V 1 hwwmm23rd March. 1942.
