E. BRIDGES,   .Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W.1.April 11, 1942.ENEMY INTENTIONS.Report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.We have been instructed to bring up to date our paper, J.I.C. (42) 75 of the14th March, 1942, and report as follows : We have examined German and Japanese strategy in the light of thedevelopment of the war in Europe and in the Far East, and have reached thefollowing conclusions, which do not differ materially from our previous views.A.-CONCLUSIONS.I.-GERMANY.2. Germany&apos;s Major Offensive.(o) Germany&apos;s first major offensive effort in 1942 will be made against russia.(b) It will start in the south.(c) Its objects will be to defeat the Russian armies and to get oil.3. Subsidiary Operations.(a) Germany will maintain and intensify her attacks on allied shipping. Inparticular she will attack the Northern supply route to Russia by sea and air.[23693] b
(b) Germany will support her forces in Libya to enable them to maintain, andif possible, to exploit their position. She will try to maintain her present air power in the Mediterranean.4.   Germany is unlikely to attempt, until after the defeat of Russia (a) An invasion of the British Isles.(b) An occupation of the Iberian Peninsula, Sweden, or French North orWest Africa.(c) An attack on Egypt through Cyprus and Syria.(d) An attack on Iraq and Persia through Cyprus and Syria or Turkey.(e) An attack on Caucasia through Turkey.(/) A move into Turkey, unless Turkey acquiesces.II.-JAPAN.5.   Japan will aim at: (a) Consolidating as quickly as possible her East Asiatic sphere and com-completing it by the occupation of Burma.(b) Achieving peace in China.(c) Occupying bases in the South-Western Pacific to cut the sea-route from america to Australia.(d) Compelling us to dissipate our troops and disperse our naval forces byraids and threats of raids.B.-ARGUMENT.Part I.-GERMANY.We believe that the following courses of action have been considered by theGerman High Command.6. Germany&apos;s Immediate Object.Germany is committed inextricably to the Russian front.It is characteristic of Hitler&apos;s strategy to try to defeat his enemies one byone, and to concentrate the greatest possible effort at the decisive point selected.We therefore believe that Germany&apos;s primary object is the complete defeat of theRussian army.7. Germany&apos;s Offensive against Russia.Recent evidence indicates that Germany is mobilising and will concentrate the whole of her available resources to defeat Russia, starting in Spring, 1942.For example, garrisons in occupied territory are being, depleted, industry is beingcombed out and satellite countries are being ruthlessly called upon to provideman-power. The only exception to this is the continued retention in the Medi-terranean of the large German air force contingent taken from Russia late in 1941.,j A full-scale campaign against Russia this year Would involve further cuts,outside the armed forces, in Germany&apos;s use of men and materials, especially oil.This would weaken her industry and reduce her war production. But althoughit would be likely to leave her with stocks of war materials exhausted, andindustrial potential impaired, she would hope that, if Russia were decisivelydefeated, the effect on the allied nations might be sufficient to persuade them tocome to terms. If this hope should prove false she might still feel she had timeto build up before our offensive effort and that of the United States had reachedproportions with which she could not cope.All evidence, however, shows this weakening is accepted as a^ risk necessaryto obtain a military decision in 1942.We attempt to assess the scale, fronts and date of a1 German offensive against russia.(a) Scale.The German forces in Russia are at present: fully extended,: but we must assume that by the Spring or early Summer some 20 infantry divisions could havebeen withdrawn and rested, taking into account the fact that certain, reliefs have
taken place to and from Russia, and that certain divisions may possibly be in course of preparation in Germany itself, whence we get little reliable information.In the case of armoured divisions, we have no information indicating thewithdrawal of any such divisions to Germany to refit. In fact, our identificationshave recently, been fairly complete, though it is possible that these identificationsmay have been those of detachments of which the main elements have been withdrawn to rest.Moreover, two new armoured divisions have recently been created, and moremay possibly be being formed in Germany, though this does not seem likely. Itwould, however, be unwise not to assume that some 10 Panzer divisions would beready for a Spring campaign to act as a spearhead for the 20 infantry divisionsmentioned above.The Germans are being forced to employ on the Russian front air forces which they hoped to rest during the winter.   Whereas they withdrew all but,1,250 aircraft from the Russian front in October, they have now been compelledto bring this figure up to 1,900 in order to meet the Russian attacks.   This maylimit the power of the offensive in the Spring.Contributions by the minor Axis Powers towards the renewed offensive may,by the 1st May, amount to some 9 or at the most 17 additional divisions. though these can hardly form the offensive spearhead, they will release German divisionswhilst themselves occupying less vital sectors. ;The maximum total, however, of rested or relieved German divisions wouldnot initially permit of a main offensive on more than one major front. Evidencepoints to this being a drive to the South to the Don; and thereafter operations to occupy the whole of Caucasia and the oilfields.(b) Possible Fronts.At the present time there are indications of the development of railways inthe Ukraine. We had indications of a programme by which gauge changing wasto have been completed in that region by the 15th March. There is evidence ofthe preparations of aerodromes in the forward areas, from Kharkov southwardsand of troop movements towards the South Russian front in excess of what wouldbe expected for defensive operations.Indications are lacking of work carried on at similar pressure on the railwaysand aerodromes in the Centre and North of the Russian front, though it is too early to make positive deductions from this.To sum up, the indications are, therefore, that the main thrust will start inthe South with a view to occupying Caucasia and obtaining oil.Subsequent operations in the Centre and the North will depend on theprogress of this operation, on the number of rested reserve divisions available,the support from the Axis allies, and Russian weaknesses.These operations may be :-(i) A drive on Leningrad with the primary object of bolstering up the Finnsand keeping them in the war.(ii) A drive on Moscow, with its political implications, and its threat to thehub of the European Russian communication system.In any case, attack will be made by sea and air on our supply route to Russiavia Archangel. If circumstances prove favourable, attack on the railway leadingsouthwards therefrom may be a subsequent operation.(c) Date.Previously, we estimated that the earliest date of German offensive wouldbe the 1st May. Although there are now indications that the zero date may wellbe put off till, say, the 15th May or later, there is not sufficient evidence yet to warrant a firm opinion.8. Attack on Shipping.The recent move of German naval units to Norway, the use of Trondheim asa naval base, the increase in the production of torpedo-carrying aircraft, and the concentration of German naval construction on U-boats, all point to the intensi-fication of attacks on our shipping. Efforts will be made to interfere with oursupply convoys to Russia.[23693] b 2
9. Efforts in Libya and Central Mediterranean Area.There is possibly one German infantry division in Sicily or Southern Italy,which could be made available to reinforce Libya. The Italians might increase their force in North Africa by two or three divisions. There is evidence that theGermans will try to maintain the force of some 600 to 700 aircraft at. its present level in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean. The role of this force would beto cover the sea-routes to Tripoli, to neutralise Malta, to support Rommel in libya and, from bases in Crete, Rhodes and other iEgean Islands, to harass our naval forces and shipping and ports in the Eastern&apos;Mediterranean.German forces in Libya are likely to be reinforced for the maintenance and,if possible, exploitation of their position in North Africa. Long-term prepara-tions are undoubtedly going on such as port development at Benghazi.There is no evidence of any concentration of troops or transport aircraft such,as would suggest the intention to invade Malta, Heavy air attacks aimed atdepriving us of the use of Malta as a base from which to attack the Axis supplyroute will continue, but may decrease in intensity as the demands of thecampaigns in Russia increase.10. Invasion of the British Isles. ,There are no indications of an attempted invasion of the British Isles.We still do not believe that Germany would make an attempt until she haddefeated Russia.   It would take at least three months after the collapse ofRussia before an invasion could be mounted.11. Occupation of the Iberian Peninsula, Morocco, French North Africa orSweden.There is no evidence of a German intention to undertake operations against any of the above territories. So long as the Russian campaign continues, thenecessity for concentrating all available forces in that area will prevent germany from embarking on new commitments elsewhere. It had been suggested thatthe recent movement of aircraft to Norway might have constituted a threat tbSweden, but the bulk of these aircraft have now been withdrawn.12. An A attack on Cyprus and Syria.A drive to the Persian Gulf and the capture and destruction of Abadanwould deny to us the oil resources on which our whole Middle East positiondepends.   The Iraq oilfields would supply Germany&apos;s needs.Germany would riot have sufficient air forces to renew the offensive on theRussian Front and at the same time to support a seaborne attack on Syria and cyprus. If Germany were able to remain on the defensive in Russia, sufficientair forces could be provided. She would not, however, have sufficient troop-carrying aircraft to stage a purely airborne attack on Cyprus, as was done inCrete, and a combined operation would therefore be necessary, with all theattendant difficulties. The British naval forces in the Eastern Mediterraneanare at present so much reduced that, given Axis air superiority, the operation isa possibility.On the other hand, the offensive spirit of the Italian navy as yet shows littlesign of developing. Until such time, moreover, as the Germans obtain the use ofair bases in Southern Anatolia, any operation against Syria via Cyprus wouldbe impracticable.There is no evidence of a German reinforcement in the Balkans and ^Egeanarea, where there are at present insufficient forces for such an operation.The land forces required to capture Cyprus and invade Syria prior to a,move on the Persian Gulf would be of the order of six divisions, includingelements of an armoured division and airborne troops.Germany could not spare the requisite land and air forces until the russian army had been defeated.We have no indication that Germany will remain on the defensive in Russiaand attempt the occupation of Cyprus arid a thrust through Syria. The weightof evidence is to the contrary.
13; An A attack through Turkey.(a)&apos; To the Middle East.In the present situation a German drive through Turkey is unlikely. the effort required on land and in the air would be such as to jeopardise success inany major operation in Russia. Turkey wants, above all, to remain neutral, and;probably looks to Great Britain and to the United States as the best guarantorsof Turkish territorial integrity after the war. The policy of Turkey is likely tobe, therefore, to withstand German demands for passage of troops whilst Russiaremains undefeated, and Turkey feels confident that the United States and&apos;ourselves will prevent the Russians obtaining control over East and South-east europe after the war.(b) Against Caucasia.Operations against Caucasia through Anatolia can be ruled out owing todifficulty of communications. Under optimum weather conditions, and with turkey acquiescent, a force of about eight divisions would take some four months to reach the Russian frontier in Caucasia. The latter part of the route, fromErzeroum onwards, is highly vulnerable to air attack.As to concrete evidence of Germany&apos;s plans in this direction, far from there being any signs of a concentration of forces against Turkey, there are indications that German forces in the Balkans are being reduced, and that railway construe-tioh and- bridging units are being withdrawn to South Russia.Admittedly there has been some building up of stores in the ^gean islands and in Greece, but this is chiefly for the German Air Force. There have also beenindications of a proportion of barges and invasion craft in the Black Sea, and inJEgean, but this is normal work, probably a preparation for seaborne operations in the Black Sea, if the offensive in South Russis is successful.14. A German-Russian Peace.The objects of Germany in attacking Russia were to gain possession ofRussian economic resources and to put an end to the potential military threat on germany&apos;s Eastern Frontier. Whilst such a peace might at first be greeted with enthusiasm in Germany and in the German army, it would secure neither of the objects for which Germany embarked on her Eastern Campaign. A compromisepeace is improbable at present.Part II. JAPAN.15. Japan&apos;s-object is to secure for herself exclusive control of the wholeof the East Asiatic area. Within that area she will, when she has developed the resources, be substantially self-sufficient on a, war-time economy. Because ofthe distance separating the areas from the Alied bases, attack on Japanesecommunications Would necessarily be limited to submarine warfare. Japan hasseen the comparative failure of the formidable U-boat effort made by Germanyagainst Britain, and is therefore unlikely to fear that submarine warfare couldvitally affect her, in her enclosed waters and with her multiplicity of air bases.16. Japan will be concerned with the protection of the extremities of herEast Asia sphere.  Taking these in turn : (a) East. She is likely to avoid a major fleet action. She has a largeforce of ocean-going submarines, and we believe^ that her policy will be to useher submarines for protection against the American fleet. The American fleetcould only attack the Japanese by moving fleet bases further west. As a defensivemeasure Japan is likely therefore to seek to occupy a chain of bases extendingfrom New Guinea to the Samoan Islands to prevent the Americans fromforestalling her. From these bases she could prevent the early establishment byus or the Americans of strong points essential for American land and air reinforcements.(b) West. Japan aims at occupying Burma and possibly pushing beyondthe frontier into parts of Bengal and Assam. By propaganda and subversionshe will try to cause us as much trouble as possible in India. Her future actionswill be governed by the success she achieves in this respect. In any event, shewill go far enough into Burma and India to cut effective communication with
China. With China isolated, she would hope to force Chiang Kai-shek to makepeace or to weaken and discredit him sufficiently to end organised Chineseresistance.Raids on Trincomalee, Colombo and our other bases in the Indian Ocean areprobable. Japan may be expected to harass our shipping routes in the indian ocean and interfere as much as possible with our supply routes between Australia,India and the Middle East. A fuelling base in Madagascar would be of great value to Japan for this purpose. It is &quot;possible, therefore, that, with the connivanceof the French, she may try to establish a base there.(c) South. We do not believe that Japan aims at the occupation of Australiaand New Zealand, but believe that she would be content with their isolation,through her occupation of bases on islands covering the approaches. Theoccupation or denial of the area of Darwin for the protection of the southernextremity of the greater East Asia area is probable. Raids on otiher parts of the coasts of Australia and New Zealand to disperse our forces are also likely.(d) North. As soon as operations in the South permit, Japan might begin to re-group her forces for an attack on the Russian Maritime Provinces in orderto eliminate the menace of bombing of Japan proper. At the present junctureit is impossible to state whether she will adopt this course or not.17. A Russo-Japanese War.It would clearly be to Germany&apos;s immediate advantage if she could persuade the Japanese to attack Russia at the same time as she renewed her offensive against the Red Army. Japan, however, will probably choose her own time. Shewill almost certainly attack Russia if she believes her about to be defeated byGermany. She may, although this is much more uncertain, attack Russia if shethinks that Germany is in danger of defeat. On the other hand, Russia, if shedefeats Germany, might quite conceivably attack Japan.In all the circumstances, war between Russia and Japan seems probable,but it is too early to say when it will break out.18. Attitude towards Germany.Japan&apos;s strategy in the Eastern Asiatic Area aims at ensuring secure controlof That area, and not at contributing to the outcome of the war between theEuropean Powers. Japan will fall in with Germany&apos;s plans only to the extentto which they further her own intentions. She will try to eliminate german influence from the Eastern Asiatic Area.(Signed) V.
