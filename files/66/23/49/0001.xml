TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.(3- fff )228THI3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OV HI 3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOVERNMENT).SECRET,WAR CABINET,VICHY MINISTERS IN THE DOMINIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,I have received through the Union High Commissioner inLondon a message from General Smuts in the following terms:-&quot;Union Government would welcome advice from HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom whether inview of radical change in Vichy orientation time hasnot come for Union and Canada to rupture relations with vichy.      This would also regularise position in other respects which may become important&quot;i2. This point was last raised by General Smuts   a month ago when, after c insulting the Prime Minister and foreign secretary,  I asked our High Commissioner in the Union to inform general Smuts that our view was that &quot;it would be better inpresent conditions not to take action for two months, but,subject to that delay, we for our part would see no objectionif General Smuts were to decide to dismiss the Vichy Ministerat such time as might seem most convenient to him&quot;,3. It is clear that General Smuts feels that the presentchange in the situation at Vichy gives him a suitable occasion for doing what he has for some time been anxious to do,namely, get rid of the Vichy Minister.k. There is also a Vichy Minister in Canada, and somemonths ago Mr,  Mackenzie King was anxious to dismiss him.We then discouraged Mr.  Mackenzie King from taking this actionon the ground that there was some advantage in stillmaintaining touch with Vichy.      I now attach a telegram fromMr. Mackenzie King which shows that he is anxious for our views in present conditions, having regard to the United states attitude as disclosed in that telegram.W.P.
