f; :u- -.-y;, r&quot; y &quot;f &apos;l&quot;&apos;rIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF&apos; HIS 3RITAITNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT).3 E 0 RET.W.P.(U2)  123.15th March. 19U2.WAR CABINET.WEjCSH REPRESENTATION,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Yesterday I received a deputation representative ofthe Welsh M.P..s,      They complained, that in departmentsgenerally there is a failure to recognise the particularposition of Wales as a distinct nation.      There is too muchof a tendency to consider all questions on a narrow technical point of view - Wales being considered merely as a part ofa larger geographical area.      This ignoring of Wales providespowder and shot for the extreme Welsh nationalists who aremischievous and tend to be against the war effort0      I wasgiven&apos;quite a number of instances in which the Welsh claim for representation on various important-committees had beenignored,,, and I consider that the deputation made its case,I suggest to the Cabinet that a directive should be issued to all departments to this effect.In all departments attention should be paid to adequate representation being given on committees, advisory councils and similar bodies to Welsh persons, and to the setting up of separate committees or organisations for wales where the separate interests of Wales as a nation maybe involved - and where there-, is no strong administrativereason for not doing so,,r When Welsh men and women,especially when they are unilingual, have for war reasons to be placed outside Y/ales, care should be taken to seethat so far as possible they are posted to Welsh units.Unless security grounds render it undesirable, they shouldbe allowed to penrj f-pri receive letters in the Welshlangur.gca . *,(Intld. )    &quot; C.R.A.9Dominions Office,1^th March, 19U2..
