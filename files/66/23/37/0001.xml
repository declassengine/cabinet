(42) 157.April 9, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE SHIPPING SITUATION.Memorandum, by the Minister of War Transport.1. The uncertainties of the shipping situation are probably now greaterthan at any previous time, partly because of movements in the Middle and far east and partly because we do not know at what rate the output of UnitedStates merchant shipping will be made available for our assistance.Effect of Diversion of Tonnage to Middle and Far East.2. The diversion of tonnage to the Far East for military purposes has reduced the proportion of our shipping loading for the United Kingdom fromthe near North American sources from about 50 per cent, of the total ayear ago to about 40 per cent., a figure which it will be difficult to increasesubstantially in the near future.This is a mal-distribution of tonnage, from the importing point of view,and will be one of the most disturbing aspects of the situation during the next three or four months.British and British-controlled Tonnage.3. In estimating the amount of British, Allied and Neutral shipping available for our service we have taken credit for replacements. We have lostan output of about 60,000 gross tons a year which we should have obtained from hong Kong. We look for a total output of 1^ million gross tons, includingtankers and coasting ships, from United Kingdom yards during 1942; on a conservative estimate the output of non-tanker ocean-going tonnage over 1,600tons gross which we may expect is about 800,000 gross tons, being the equivalent of the output of this class of vessel in 1941. Further, we expect delivery of nearly 400,000 gross tons from United States yards under the Todd shipbuildingagreement; and from recent advices from Sir Arthur Salter it appears that theoutput in Canada during the year may be put at about 420,000 gross tons (ofwhich about 260,000 gross tons will be constructed under Lease-Lend; arrange-ments). A small amount of tonnage may be built in Australia. The total ofthese items is about 1,650,000 gross tons of non-tanker ocean-going shipping.4. Over the year a reasonable estimate of losses of British-controlledtonnage from all causes would be 4,500,000 gross tons for vessels over 1.600 tonsgross, of which 1,200,000 gross tons would apply to tankers.5.   A main factor in the computation of our importing capacity is theamount of the non-tanker tonnage allocated to Naval, Military and Air Force[23680]
requirements.   Including the related vessels under repair, this has risen, withthe progress of the war,&quot; as follows : Thousand Thousandgross deadweighttons. tons.December 31, 1939   .........          2,120: 1.880December 31, 1940   ...       ......          3,960 3 480June 30, 1941          .........          4,230 3,670December 31, 1941   .........          4,800 4 360January 31, 1942    .........          5,180 4,930February 28, 1942 (provisional)   ...          5,354 5,211The deadweight figure at the 31st January, 1942, represented about 24 percent, of the total British and British-controlled tonnage over 1,600 gross tons,but it must be borne in mind that much of this allocated tonnage is employedhomeward to carry cargo to the United Kingdom.Prospects of United Kingdom Import Programme.6. Imports of 1941. The non-tanker imports of 30^ million tons in 1941were assisted during the second haig of that year by a much lower rate of lossthan we were entitled to assume when the earlier estimates were made. Thismarked falling off in losses had the effect of substantially increasing our imports and, being of a &quot; capital &quot; nature, also gave us additional shipping for subsequentvoyages.. Moreover, during the last six months of 1941, there was littleinterference with shipping in our ports by &quot; blitz.&quot;7. Imports of 1942. In a recent estimate of our non-tanker ocean-borneimports in British and British-controlled tonnage during 1942 (assuming thecontinuance of the existing measure of American assistance), which was subsequently adjusted to allow for further movements of troops and equipment to the East, just decided on, the conclusion was arrived at that we might meetthe demands of the Fighting Services as known&apos; at present and import into theUnited Kingdom about 25 million tons.This estimate may be reduced by adverse contingencies. Thus, losses mayexceed the allowances made; there may be a recurrence of severe air raids upon our ports; and still further tonnage may be diverted to the Eastern theatres ofwar. It should also be borne in mind that such adverse factors may show themselves in the immediate or near future, while any accretion of our resources to be expected from additional United States building is likely to be deferred.8. On the other hand, the estimate is subject to increase in so far as additional assistance from the United States is secured.Prospects of American Assistance.9. The tendency at the moment is for United States assistance to us to diminish rather than increase. At the beginning of the year we were warned bySir Arthur Salter that the future general position of American shippingassistance to the United Kingdom and to Red Sea and other services was becoming-worse, that he could hardly overstate the difficulties of the tonnage position onthat side of the Atlantic in the near future, and that United States ships didnot exist in sufficient numbers to meet all the new demands and projects, even if all United States ships were withdrawn from our services.*10. In these circumstances, the only practical course has been to estimateour carrying capacity on the basis of our own resources and to assume that weretain the existing measure of United States assistance (including new tonnageunder the Todd agreement). We can then interpret the result with reference toany margin to be secured by the development of the closer control now being takenby the United States over their shipping, and to the rapid increase in theirconstruction as the year 1942 proceeds.11. The probable extent of this increase is not at present easy to express inany figure.,,,,,, Balance of shipping gains and losses in 1942.12. In Appendix I an estimate is given of the new building completions ofUnited States merchant ocean-going tonnage, between the 30th September, 1941,and the end of June next.* Tonnage, amounting to about 300,000 gross tons, which formerly supplied the needs ofthe Netherlands Bast Indies and adjacent areas, will be available for other work.
13. Subject to all necessary qualifications and reserves, and pending betterinformation, a provisional summary of the net gain in tonnage during 1942 may-be attempted, taking British, British-controlled and United States, tonnagetogether. Eliminating coasters, colliers and other small vessels, and assuming that the United States programme of 8 million deadweight tons will be achieved,new building inj.942 may be summarised as follows :  [Figures in million gross tons.)Non-tankers. Tankers.Great Britain   ...      ...... -80 -30Canada and Australia ...... -45U.S.A. (on British account)    ... -40(a)Total, British      ......        1-65 -30U.S.A.......4-40(a) ...&quot;      -80(a)Less coasters, &amp;c.   ...     -15 4-25 ... -805-90 .1-10 y.[Note (u) The sum of these three items is 5-6 million gross tons, which is approxirrijjvutjequivalent to the United States programme of 8 million deadweight tons.] /14. In 1942 losses of British-controlled tonnage have been assessed in para-graph 4 at 4 - 5 million gross tons, including tankers. Losses of British-controlled,Allied and United States tonnage, taken together, from all causes, have been assessed, after discussion with the Admiralty, at 6-5 million gross tons(4-5 million gross tons non-tankers and 2 million gross tons tankers).15.   Bringing the figures together we have :  [Million gross tons.)Non-tankers.      Tankers. Both.Gains...... 5-90 1-10 7-00Losses   ...... 4-50 2-00 6-50Net gain or loss (-f) 1 - 40 (-) - 90 (+ ) - 50On the basis of these figures the net gain by the end of the year in the caseof non-tankers would amount to 1 - 4 million gross tons; for tankers there wouldbe a net loss of nearly a million gross tons.16. It was stated in a recent telegram from the British Shipping Mission,Washington, that the United States building programme for 1942 might slipback by 400,000 tons deadweight, i.e., approximately 300,000 gross tons.17. An analysis of the gains and losses by speed suggests that the greateraverage speed of the new tonnage would represent an effective gain, in terms ofexisting tonnage, of some 200.000 gross tons in the case of non-tankers and100,000 gross tons for tankers. If, therefore, &quot;slip&quot; in the United Statesprogramme occurred to the extent mentioned, the shortage thus arising wouldapproximately neutralise the effective gain in tonnage due to increased speed.If, however, &quot; slip &quot; exceeded this figure, the estimated net gain of tonnageduring 1942, mentioned in paragraph 15, viz., 500,000 gross tons, would requireto be reduced by the amount of the excess.Summary.18. The dominant factors affecting the result will be United states assistance, losses and the effects direct or indirect of military operations.Steps are being taken to expedite the restoration to ocean service, during theI&apos; summer, of certain vessels engaged in the coasting trade during the winter, butthe effects upon imports can only be very limited. The position would be helped by an increase in our own rate of construction, by an even more intensive attack upon repairs (if only to offset congestion in ports abroad, which must result from the loss of repair centres in the Far East, &amp;c.) and by even greater efforts,such as are now being made, to improve turn-round.19. Taking the various factors into consideration, an allowance of about10 per cent, either way On a target of 25 million tons may be regarded as indi-cating the probable range within which importation may lie, i.e., a range of from23 to 27 million tons.
Our imports are at present estimated to amount to about 1\ million tons inthe first four months of the year, and, if they are to reach a total of 25 million tons, should amount to about 9-^ million tons in the next four months, leaving to he brought in during the last four months something in excess of 8 million tons.Estimate of tonnage gains and losses in 1943.20. Any estimate for 1943 which can be made at this moment must iieces-sarily be speculative, but a rough approximation is made in Appendix II, fromwhich it will be seen that there is a prospect of a net gain of 5 million gross tonsby the end of the year.:   L.Ministry of War Transport.

New Building.(a) United States. A recent telegram from the British Shipping Mission,Washington, suggests that new building during the two years1942-1943 may amount to 22 million tons deadweight. After allowing for the new building in 1942 (7-6 million tons deadweight) and forthe building of small vessels in 1943, the balance of ocean-going vessels in 1943 may be put at 14 million tons deadweight.million gross tons.This, in terms of gross tons, is equivalent to ...        9-8(b) Great Britain       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        1-1(c) Canada and Australia, say       ...       ...       ...       ... -511-4II.
