\c^^c        MrTHIS D0CUMENTJ[3 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1942:SECRET . ./: copy no/W.P. (42) 130.March 20, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.   .SUPPLY OF BRITISH OFFICERS FOR INDIAN ARMY AND their pay.Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.IN circulating my comments on the Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (W.P. (42) 125) I share his regret that it is necessary to refer, thisquestion to the War Cabinet. I also do not regard the case as primarily a financial one; I consider it rather as one which vitally affects the efficiency of theIndian Army, and I would remind my colleagues that on the 5th February theWar Cabinet gave general approval to my submission with regard to the need for ensuring an adequate supply of suitable officers for the Indian military forces.It is not the case, as the Secretary of State for War suggests, that he is asked to agree to a certain course, as if I had. suggested a novel concession for officers of the Indian Army; on the contrary, it is I who am being asked by theSecretary of State for War to depart from the accepted method of recruiting and paying the British officers of the Indian Army. It has long been accepted that the British officers of the Indian Army are paid at a higher rate than thoseof the British Service, and that they are composed of officers who freely chooseservice with the Indian Army. It is this settled policy which my colleague wishes to alter, and my memorandum explains at length the objections to his proposal,which, basing itself on a question of pay, results as shown in paragraph 8 of his memorandum in the denial to the Indian Army of its own body of officers and inits becoming dependent on the British Service for such officers as the latter may provide. I am strongly of opinion that.a radical change of this sort is mostinadvisable at the present moment.L. S. A.India Office,March 20, 1942.[23595]
Comments by Secretary of State for India on Memorandum by Secretary of Statefor War.The submission of the Secretary of State for War (W.P. (42) 125) is not infact confined to the simple question set out in the first paragraph of his coveringnote, namely, the rates of pay issuable to officers of the British Service serving with Indian units or formations outside India, because, in paragraph 8, he makes the much more radical proposal that the Indian Army should cease to take furthercandidates direct from this country, whether appointed through O.C.T.Us. hereor through O.C.T.Us. in India, and whether schoolboy cadets or British other ranks, and that all its requirements (except so far as recruitment takes place inIndia itself) should in future be met by the attachment of British Service officers.2. During the whole of the last war all the needs of the Indian Army for officers were met by direct appointments, temporary or otherwise, to the indian army, and the officers so appointed received full Indian Army terms. Duringthe present war the situation has been substantially different. To some extent the needs of the Indian Army are now met by the appointment of Indian officers,who serve on rates of pay lower than those for British officers. The balance ofthe requirements of the Indian Army is met by the temporary appointment ofEuropean officers and, according to the rules hitherto and at present in force,these temporary European officers, whether holding Indian Army Commissionsor holding British commissions and attached to the Indian Army, draw in Indiaand elsewhere an allowance equal to half the normal Indian Army allowance,that is to say, half the difference between the pay of officers of the British service in India and that of Indian Army officers.3.   The case which I am now arguing is (1) that the Indian Army should not be deprived of the right, which it hasenjoyed so long and which I and the Indian authorities regard as necessary for its efficiency, of obtaining its own officers as far aspossible on a voluntary basis; and(2) that the officers who serve with the Indian forces should be paid alike,whether commissioned direct to the Indian Army or obtained byattachment from the British Service, and should, whether serving inIndia or elsewhere with Indian troops, continue to draw, in additionto basic Indian rates, the half-rate of Indian Army allowance hithertoregarded as appropriate for service with Indian troops. I recognise,that the Secretary of State for War is animated by a desire to securewhat he regards as fair treatment between one class of British officer and,another, and to avoid possible causes of discontent. Like him,I do not argue the case upon financial grounds, except so far as theyare inseparable from other considerations, and I base myself uponthe need for military efficiency and for a tolerably well satisfied bodyof officers in the Indian Army, without which we shall not secureefficiency and shall fail to take full advantage of India&apos;s vast resourcesof military manpower.4. I will deal with the more fundamental question first. As the wa.lengthens, and especially as it develops in eastern theatres, we become increasinglydependent on India, where alone in the Empire is still to be found a greatreservoir of man-power suitable for military purposes. It is well known and generally accepted that Indian troops are particularly dependent upon their officers and specially upon their British officers, and the fighting qualities of thenew Indian formations will be largely determined by the success with which thecommissioned cadres are filled. Indian units have much smaller establishments of commissioned officers British and Indian than those of the British Service.The level of responsibility among the junior officers is consequently higher andthere is less room fjor misfits. Special qualities and qualifications are required and I shall later refer to these in greater detail.5. I do not accept any analogy between the Indian and the Colonial forces.Without in any way wishing to depreciate the value and quality of the colonial forces, I must point out that the Indian Army is of very much greater importance and stands upon an entirely different footing. Unlike the Colonial forces, theIndian Army has a long and honourable history as a separate service, and it
would be bound to cause heartburning and misunderstanding if, suddenly andfor no reason that would be apparent, it were made entirely dependent upon theBritish Service for its officers, just at a time when more is expected of it than ever before. The proportion of British officers and n.c.os. is far higher withthe Colonial than with the Indian forces.6. We may not be able to get officers for the Indian Army as good in all respects as we should wish. But I submit that we should be taking an unnecessary and an unjustifiable risk if at this critical juncture we do not continue to employthe voluntary system so far as it will serve us. It should be borne in mind thatIndian troops are themselves all volunteers. There has been some experiencelately on a comparatively small scale of the system which the Secretary of Statefor War now proposes to apply wholesale, and I understand that this experiencedoes not point to satisfactory results. In the last six months, for certain reasonsincluding the abnormal numbers required, the voluntary system has not producedas many as have been needed and to make up the deficiency a number of british service officers have been compulsorily drafted to India for attachment to theIndian Army. Preliminary reports which have been received on these officers are by no means favourable. So far from agreeing to the substitution of the compulsory for the voluntary system, I maintain that the voluntary system shouldbe the means of serving all the needs of the Indian Army, and I believe that withimprovements in its application which, are being discussed. between the two departments it can, with the help of the Army Council, be made to do so.7. The Viceroy and his advisers strongly support the view which I take,and consider that the proposal which I am resisting involves undue risks withoutcompensating advantages. If further competent advice is desired, I suggest thatit should be sought from Generals Wavell and Auchinleck, both of whom are familiar with the conditions of the problem and are directly concerned with theefficiency of the forces that are to be supplied from India.8. Turning now to the second question, that of pay, I appreciate theimportance of avoiding discontent on account of different rates being issuable toofficers whose circumstances and responsibilities are similar. But by abolishingone differentiation the proposal of the Secretary of State for War creates another.We should have officers in the same units getting different rates for preciselysimilar duties, whereas the present differentiation, which the Secretary of Statefor War desires to remove, is one between different Services, and is, moreover, adifferentiation which has invariably prevailed up to now both in peace and warwithout, so far as anyone is aware, having given rise to any seripus clissatisfac-tion or complaint. It appears to me to be far the lesser evil of the two, if it isan evil at all. Indeed, I believe it to be generally understood and accepted that service with Indian troops qualifies for some advantage in respect of pay. Thepresent system, as I have already pointed out, is an improvement on that of thelast war in the direction desired by the Secretary of State for War, in that, apartfrom the fact that many of the officers of the Indian Army are now Indian officers,the European temporary officers serving with it draw only half the normal rateof Indian. Army allowance and not the full Indian Army terms. I may pointout, top, that if some of the officers serving with Indian units get British rates,while others must, as the Secretary of State for War recognises, get Indian rates,the officers of each unit will come under two pay codes and paymasters, and thiswill result in great administrative inconvenience and an additional burden of administrative routine.9. I maintain strongly that the principle of extra pay for service with indian troops, as modified to the extent of issuing Indian Army allowance athalf rates for temporary service, is fully justified on its merits. The opinion pfmyself and the Indian authorities is fully supported by Generals Wavell andAuchinleck. The position of British officers in command of Indian troops is oneof peculiar responsibility. There are, as I have observed, fewer commissioned officers to the unit than in the British Service and the duties of the junior officers are consequently on a higher level. The British officer has to adjust himself toco-operate with his Indian colleagues and the troops under him are men ofdifferent race and upbringing, whose mentality, traditions and customs he must make a special effort to appreciate. Moreover, he has up to a point to learn theirlanguages.   It seems to me perfectly reasonable, if not necessary, that this should
continue to a moderate extent to be recognised in his pay, as it has been invariablyrecognised in the past, just as specialist qualifications are recognised in various branches of the British Service.10. The Secretary of State for War accepts the position that these officers should continue to serve on relatively favourable terms so long as they remainin India, and his proposal relates only to their period of service overseas.    Itseems to me that it will be regarded as particularly anomalous, and will be likelyto lead to serious misunderstanding, if officers lose the advantage they have beenenjoying in India as soon as they go on service to a possibly adjacent theatre of active operations.11. The comparison between the two pay syystems, as applied to the middle east, does not show startling advantages in favour of Indian Army officers.Indeed, in the case of a typical lieutenant there is no difference worth mentioning.In the case of a typical captain it amounts to  8 a month. In the migher ranks it is greater. But we are dealing only with temporary officers and not very many of these are likely to reach a&apos; higher rank than that of captain. the differences will be reduced as a result of the increase of income tax in the forth-coming Indian budget.12. The Secretary of State for War does not deny that, if officers are infuture to be commissioned as temporary officers of the Indian Army, they wouldhave to get, as in the past, additional pay as compared with the British Service.I hope that I have sufficiently demonstrated the need for continuing to supply theIndian Army with officers either by direct temporary appointment or by transfer.The present arrangement, by which the temporary officer of the Indian Armyreceives half the Indian Army allowance for regular officers, was the result ofagreement with the Army Council before the war. When the. system ofattachment of British Service officers, rather than of their transference to theIndian Army, was introduced, it was done purely for reasons of administrative convenience and not with the intention that it should have any bearing upon therates of pay issuable. So far as the officer and his duties and responsibilities areconcerned, there is no difference whatever between attachment as a result of voluntary application and transference, and the arguments which I have advancedfor additional pay apply equally in both cases.13.   The conclusions which I therefore draw are :: (1) that the Indian Army should not be deprived of the right of obtaining its officers by direct appointment on a voluntary basis; and(2) that in principle, and subject to certain minor matters (including thequestion of Indian Army officers serving in staff appointments referredto at the end of the Memorandum of the Secretary of State for War)which might be agreed to between the Secretary of State for War and myself, the present system of pay, with the income tax anomalycorrected, should continue, in order that all requirements, including those of the technical arms of the Indian Army, may be adequatelyand efficiently met. The two things hang together and I do not thinkit is possible to approve one without also approving the other, or toaccept the contention of the Secretary of State for War with regardto pay without incurring the risks involved in radically altering thesystem of appointments to commissioned ranks in the Indian Army.14. The War Cabinet on the 5th February (W.M. (42) 16th Conclusions,Minute 4) gave their general approval to the submission made in my paper onIndians War Effort, W.P. (42) 54, with regard to the. need for ensuring anadequate supply of suitable officers for the Indian military forces. I look uponthe two propositions set out above as vital in this connection, and hope that I mayclaim support for them on the strength of the approval which the War Cabinetrecorded on the 5th February. It is for this reason that I felt that if theSecretary of State for War wished to pursue the proposal which he had made tome it should be brought to the attention of the War Cabinet itself.
