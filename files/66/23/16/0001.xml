NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. A successful naval operation was carried out in the Mediterranean; inwhich a convoy was escorted from Alexandria to Malta, in spite of opposition by a greatly superior Italian naval force and heavy German air opposition. Threeout of four ships of the convoy reached Malta, but in subsequent air attacks theremaining ships were all damaged.The number of attacks on U-boats has increased and at least two have been destroyed.Shipping losses continue to be heavy; due mainly to U-boat attacks in theWest Atlantic.A number of successes have been reported by our submarines in theMediterranean.Home Waters.2. &apos; In an attack on a coastal convoy off the North Cornish coast on the 20th,a Do. 125 was destroyed, and a Ju. 88 damaged, by gunfire from the convoy andescorting ships.Mediterranean.3. A fast convoy of four ships carrying supplies to Malta left Alexandriaon the 21st. A few hours later, ELM. Destroyer Hurworth, which was sweepingahead, was torpedoed and eventually sank. The following morning, when about200 miles south-east of Malta and in poor visibility, the covering force (H.M.Cruisers Cleopatra, Dido, Euryalus, Penelope and nine destroyers) sighted four enemy cruisers, which they attacked and drove off without receiving damage.Two hours later, the enemy, then consisting of one &apos;&apos; Littorio &apos;&apos; class battleship,two 8-inch and four other cruisers with a number of destroyers, were again sightedand attacked by the covering force. In this action the battleship was torpedoedamidships by. one of our destroyers and set on fire by gunfire from the cruisers.Two of the enemy cruisers were damaged by gunfire and the enemy retired with-out having made contact with the convoy. Some damage was suffered byH.M. Ships Cleopatra, Kingston, Havock and Lively. Throughout the 22nd,heavy but ineffective air attacks were made on the convoy and H.M. ships.Air attacks were resumed the next morning when the convoy was about 45miles south of Malta, with an easterly gale blowing. The s.s. Clan Campbell(7,255 tons) was sunk, H.M. Auxiliary Supply Ship Breconshire (9,776 tons) wasdisabled and H.M. Destroyer Legion was damaged. The remaining two ships ofthe convoy, the s.s. Pampas (5,415 tons) and the Norwegian s.s. Talabot (6,798 tons),entered the Grand Harbour. The heavy weather made it impossible to bring inthe Breconshire and, after lying at anchor off the Island, she was towed intoMarsaxlokk, south-east of Malta, on the 25th. H.M.S. Southwold, one of the destroyers screening her while she was at anchor on the 24th, struck a mine and sank some hours later.On the 26th a heavy air attack was made on shipping at Malta. The Pampasand Talnbot were hit, a large part of the cargo of the latter being destroyed, andthe: Breconshire was set on fire. H.M.S. Penelope was holed and H.M. SubmarineP. 39 damaged by near misses. H.M. Destroyer Legion was again hit and sunk.The Fleet Oiler Plumleaf was hit and beached and H.M. Destroyer A von Valewas slightly damaged. .        &apos; x4. A reinforcement of aircraft for Malta consisting of nine Spitfires was flown off from H.M. aircraft carriers on the 21st.H.M. Destroyer Jaguar, escorting a convoy from Alexandria to Tobruk, was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat on the 26th to the north-east of Sollum.The following successes have been reported&quot; by H.M. submarines :-Unbeaten,&apos; on the 16th, attacked off Cape Spartivento a strongly escorted rmerchant ship of 11,000 tons, which is believed to have sunk. On the following day Unbeaten torpedoed and sank an Italian U-boat, probably of the A rgonmotaclass (600 tons). Upholder, on the 19th, sank a U-boat by torpedo and a trawlerby gunfire off Brindisi. Turbulent, between the 27th February and the 13th March,sank by gunfire a motor craft of 60 tons carrying troops Off the1 west coast of
G-reece, four large schooners off the Gulf of Salonika and two schooners off south-east Greece. Torbay, on the 27th February, sank a 1,000-ton merchant ship offthe west coast of Greece and, on the 5th March, torpedoed one merchant ship of5,000 tons and probably another of 8,000 tons in Corfu Roads. Thorn, on the5th March, destroyed a 200-ton brigantine off the west coast of Greece. Una, on-the 13th, sank a 300-ton schooner bound for Tripoli.During the week, upwards of 26,000 tons of French merchant shipping east-bound and 6,589 tons westbound have passed Gibraltar under escort.Pacific.5. A successful operation was carried out on the 10th March by american naval aircraft against Japanese forces in New Guinea. Two heavy cruisers andthree transports were sunk and a number of other ships were either sunk or damaged.Two attacks on shipping in Rabaul Harbour were carried out by australian and American aircraft. One enemy cruiser was possibly sunk and two othercruisers were damaged.The Naval Quarters at Darwin were seriously damaged by enemy aircraft on,the 19th.A nti-Submarine Operations.6. In addition to the U-boats destroyed by H.M. Submarines Unbeaten andUpholder in the Mediterranean, an outward-bound U-boat was torpedoed byELM. Submarine Seawolf 170 miles to the westward of Trondheim. An attack by ELM. Destroyer Hurricane and H.M. Corvette Anchusa off the Rockall Bankprobably resulted in the destruction of a U-boat. ELM. Minesweeper Sharp-shooter, escorting a homeward convoy from Russia, rammed a U-boat south ofBear Island (Barenfs Sea).Promising attacks were carried out by the escorts of an outward convoy southof Newfoundland and by Canadian aircraft to the southward of Nova Scotia.Nine other attacks were made by surface craft, of which four were american and two were Canadian ships. Aircraft, including three American aircraft,carried out six further attacks. Of these attacks, eight took place off the american and Canadian Atlantic coasts, three in the North-Western Approaches,, three inthe Mediterranean, and one to the southward of Sierra Leone.Enemy Intelligence.German.7. The 8-inch cruiser Admiral Hipper was seen by air reconnaissance inHjeltfiord, north of Bergen, on the 20th. At Kiel, the Gneisenau has left the floating dock and the Scharnhorst is now occupying the dock. The Gneisenau isconsidered to be the most heavily damaged of any of the enemy main units.U-boats.8. The chief U-boat activity has been off the Atlantic &quot;coast of north america. There has been a reduction in activity in the Caribbean Sea, whereonly one attack was reported during the week. A few U-boats have been;operating in the North-Western Approaches. In Northern Waters, there are indications that several have reached the South Greenland Sea. In the south atlantic, two or three U-boats are operating between Takoradi and Freetown.Focke-Wulf A aircraft.9. There has been a transfer of Focke-Wulf 200 aircraft from Bordeaux to norway and Denmark, resulting in the largest concentration yet reported in this area. The aircraft are probably intended to provide reconnaissance cover for,operations by the German naval units.Japan.10.   No major changes in the disposition of the main forces have beenreported.A force of three cruisers and six destroyers has been sighted at Port Blair,Andaman Islands.A concentration of transports and landing craft has been reported at Timor.[23617] b
Protection of Sea-borne Trade.11. During the week ending the 25th March 897 ships, including 245 allied and 22 neutral, were convoyed. Seven cruisers and anti-aircraft ships, two armed merchant cruisers, 68 destroyers (including 17 American and two Russiandestroyers) and 114 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the21st March totalled 541,000 tons, compared with an average of 601,900 tons forthe past ten weeks.  Of the week&apos;s imports, 71,000 tons were oil of various grades.During the month of February imports, other than mineral oil, were asfollows : Ministry of Food, 987,200 tons, Ministry of Supply, 865,000 tons, Boardof Trade, 47,300 tons.  Total, 1,900,000 tons.Enemy Attack on Trade.12. During the week U-boats are known to have torpedoed 14 ships,including ten tankers. Seven of these attacks were off the Atlantic coasts ofAmerica and Canada, four in the Bermuda area, one north-west of Aruba, oneb&apos;ff&quot;Sollum and one off Cape Palmas (Liberia).Aircraft sank two ships and damaged three others. One ship was sunk andone damaged off Malta. One ship was sunk and another damaged in Channelconvoys and one ship was damaged at Murmansk.British Minelaying.13. A few mines have been laid during the week by M.L&apos;s off the Dutch andFlemish coasts. There has been considerable minelaying by aircraft off theGerman North Sea coast and in the Bay of Biscay area.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.14. Enemy aircraft are believed to have laid mines on four nights of theweek off the East Coast between the Thames Estuary and Lowestoft, off the south coast from Portsmouth to Lyme Bay and off the south coast of Ireland.Twenty magnetic mines have been destroyed during the week, eighteen ofthem off the East Coast south of the Humber. The mine totals now are:magnetic 1,924, acoustic 1.246 and contact 1,116.Foreign Waters.15. Enemy mines have been reported to the east of the Diamond Shoals, off cape Hatteras.. The presence of a minefield off Capetown has been confirmed.The Japanese are reported to have mined Mamatanai on the north-east coast of New Ireland.Enemy Merchant Shipping.Germany and Italy.16. An abnormal number of merchant ships were seen by air reconnaissanceon the 23rd at Kristiansand (South Norway). Most of the 45 ships present had arrived since the 1st of the month.The Venezuelan Government have attached the German s.s. Durazzo(1,153 tons) and six Italian tankers, totalling 37,167 tons, in Venezuelan ports.Japan.17. The Japanese possess 77 tankers with a total tonnage of 517,000 tons,which is considered to be barely sufficient for their present commitments.vichy Merchant Shipping.18. No supplies for Libya appear to have been sent from France since thes.s. St. Fernard (4,312 tons) sailed from Marseilles on the 19th February fromTunis.
American Intelligence.19. The Aircraft Carrier Yorktown and five heavy cruisers are in the Anzacarea. The force lately in the Suva area is on its way to Pearl Harbour; other-wise, dispositions are largely unchanged.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Lake Ilmen-Lake Seliger Sector.20. The Russians consider that the elimination of the encircled portion ofthe German 16th Army in the Staraya Russa sector is only a question of time.Their Air Force is concentrating against the German transport aircraft, whichare the sole means of supply of the beleaguered troops.Central Sector.21. There has been continued fierce fighting but little change in positions.The Russians are making determined efforts to reduce the Rzhev salient byconcentric attacks from the west of Rzhev itself and from the. area north-east ofGshatsk. Further south they appear to have gained ground in the direction ofVyasma from the Yukhnov area, despite stubborn German resistance. They are thus nearer to the main German communications. Gshatsk-Vyasma-Smolensk.Dorogobuzh, which was seized by parachute troops about a month ago, is stillin Russian hands but remains isolated from their main forces. There are, however,indications that they may have made some progress towards Yelnya from thesouth-east.Ukraine.22. There has been heavy fighting all along the front in the Ukraine asfar south as Taganrog, but no positional change except north-east of Kharkov.Crimea.23. The Russians are still maintaining pressure from the Kerch Peninsula,but there has been little change in the position.Libya.24. Activity during the week on both sides has been confined to patrolling,except for a successful raid on a fairly Large scale carried out by our forces onthe 21st and 22nd March. In this action some columns of our forward troopsraided the enemy&apos;s forward defended localities and brought back about 120prisoners, the majority of whom are Germans. On the 21st March our artilleryshelled Martuba and Tmimi landing grounds during the day and Free french troops shelled enemy transport at El Hamarin about 30 miles S.S.E. of Mekili.Some of our patrols penetrated to a point 20 miles N.E. of Mekili. The principalenemy resistance was met in the area seven miles south of Tmimi and an enemycounter-attack with tanks was staged in the area Gabr El Aleima. On the 22ndall columns completed their allotted tasks and withdrew. Our casualties were approximately 50.Burma.Sittang Front.25. During the 18th and 19th March the Japanese tried to advance up theloungoo road but without much success. On the 20th Japanese infantry andcavalry, strength about 600, were engaged by Chinese cavalry and infantry. TheJapanese retired, losing 100 killed.[23617] B 2
The Chinese commenced to take over this sector from the British on the 2lst,the British moving into reserve on the right flank.During the 23rd and 24th a great deal of hand-to-hand fighting occurred.The Japanese managed to cut the road to Mandalay at Kyungon, seven miles north of Toungoo. The aerodrome at Toungoo is in Japanese hands, though the Chinesestill hold their positions at this town.Irrawaddy Front.26. On the 18th one of our guerrilla squads, supported by Royal Marines,engaged some enemy at Herizada, inflicting casualties. This front has been fairly quiet.The Gloucestershire Regiment, supported by tanks, attacked Letpadausuccessfully on the 20th March, dispersing the Japanese who occupied it.An Indian Brigade has arrived for the defence of Akyab.Pacific Area.27. The Japanese claim to have occupied Buka Island in the Solomons isnot confirmed.Intelligence.France and Spain.28. In the light of recent information it is estimated that there are atpresent 26 German divisions in France, practically all of which are of poor quality.There is no likelihood of any German action against the Iberian Peninsulain the near future.Bulgaria.29. Rumours, indicating that Bulgaria is preparing to take a more active part in military operations in support of the Axis, are circulating freely. no military developments of importance, however, appear to be taking place and,as far as is known, the Bulgarian army is well below mobilization strength. Thegarrison of five full strength divisions on the Turkish frontier is normal.Far East.30. It is estimated that there are still 29 Divisions employed in the area of operations in the South-West Pacific, but it is believed that the Japanese Forcesin Thailand have been reinforced by one Division, and that one Division has left the Canton-Hong Kong area. These changes suggest the building up of a reserve in Thailand which can be made immediately available in Burma should thenecessity arise.n       , -   . AIR SITUATION.General Review.31.   Bomber Command aircraft carried out a heavy raid on Essen^SMSS^? ***** &quot; tto - -e,-y heavyJapan^airSaff aerodromes * Akyab were heavily attacked by united Kingdom.:,     32.   Fighter Command flew 1,724 sorties by day and 202 by night.33. Enemy activity against this country was on a small scale andhandicapped by adverse weather.. Small attacks at dusk were made on Weymouth,Portland and Dover.  Two Ju-. 88s were shot down and three others damaged.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.34. Fighter Command despatched 392 sorties on offensive operations. Inaddition, a total of 27 Bostons of Bomber Command attacked three targets inNorthern France-the thermic power station at Comines, the railway centres atAbbeville, and the shipyards at Le Trait. All three attacks were carried out in good visibility. At Comines, the target is believed to have been hit, and at LeTrait many hits were observed on the main buildings and the western pier, and.a5,000-ton merchant vessel was probably damaged. No results were observed atAbbeville.35. Twenty squadrons of Spitfires provided support for these operationsbut only small enemy fighter opposition was encountered. FoUr F.W. 190&apos;s were destroyed, another was probably destroyed, and a further four were damaged.Nine Spitfires were lost, but two pilots are safe.36. Two sweeps by a total of 20 squadrons of Spitfires were carried out overthe Pas-de-Calais. Very few.combats resulted, although a considerable numberof enemy fighters were identified, and the general impression was that the enemy had little desire to come to close quarters. One F.W. 190 was destroyed and aMe. 109 was damaged for the loss of one Spitfire.Night.37. Prolonged bad weather restricted operations by Bomber Commandagainst land targets to one night only, when 254 aircraft were despatched againstEssen. Two hundred and twenty-three tons of HE. and over 27,000 incendiaries were dropped over the target area, but although cloud was negligible, groundhaze hampered the observation of results. Many large fires and explosions were,however, seen in the town, in the Krupps works, and in a railway centre.Numerous scattered fires were observed over the whole area. Nine aircraft are missing from this attack.38. On the same night, in excellent visibility, a small scale but successful attack was carried out on St. Nazaire. A further 26 aircraft dropped leafletsover the Lille and Paris areas.39. Bostons and Havocs of Fighter Command attacked aerodromes inNorthern France, bombs being dropped at Dinard, Rennes, Poix, Beauvais,Evreux, Lille, Vendeville and St. Andre.Coastal Operations.40. Coastal Command despatched 320 sorties, of which 83 were engaged on convoy escort. Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved796 sorties.41. Bomber Command despatched 19 aircraft by day to lay sea mines offthe Frisian Islands, and a total of 90 by night were engaged on similar operationsoff Lorient.   One hundred and sixty-six mines were laid.42. There were few attacks on enemy shipping. A patrol boat was attacked with depth charges and left sinking; an armed trawler and a 1,000-ton merchant vessel were machine-gunned; and a 2,500-ton tanker off the Dutch Coast was bombed from mast-height, but results were not observed owing to evasive action.43. Two Spitfires on a shipping reconnaissance in the Channel saw anenemy float-plane shot down by German AA. fire.44. Apart from the usual shipping and weather reconnaissances, the enemymade three small-scale attacks on convoys off the East and South Coasts. A totalof approximately 25 enemy aircraft were engaged in minelaying by night in the thames Estuary/Harwich area and oft&apos; the Dorset Coast. One long-range recon-naissance flight was carried out over Northern Ireland and Eire.
Mediterranean.Libya and Egypt.45 Our bombers concentrated on enemy landing grounds. These attackscoincided with the despatch of the Malta convoy from Alexandria on the20th March.46. In daylight, Bostons with fighter escort made three raids on Martubaaerodrome, where it is estimated half of the Italian fighter force in Cyrenaica isbased, and also attacked Barce. Bombs burst on and near aircraft on the ground and some fires were started. These attacks were intercepted by enemy fighters,three of which were destroyed and three others probably destroyed by the escort.Three Bostons were shot down and four Kittyhawks are missing.47. At night, Wellingtons attacked aerodromes at Berca and Benghazi andalso bombed Benghazi harbour. Twelve Hurricanes effectively bombed and machine-gunned M.T. camps and A.A. gun positions in the Mar.tuba-De.rna-El Tmimi area.48. Our fighters maintained offensive sweeps over the forward area, andon the 20th made 87 sorties in protection of shipping. No serious enemy opposi-tion was encountered.49. Several bombing attacks, chiefly by fighter bombers (Me. 109s) were carried out against our forward aerodromes, and at Gambut three aircraftsuffered some damage. There were also dive-bombing attacks on our ground forces.Malta.50. The enemy attacks on the island and shipping in the vicinity were on avery heavy scale, involving approximately 940 sorties. This is at least 60 percent, in excess of the total for the previous week.51. The heaviest attack which has yet been delivered against Malta wasmade on the 21st March, when Takali aerodrome was the main objective. a mixed force of nearly 220 enemy aircraft participated in this raid, and greatdevastation was caused among buildings, and a reservoir was destroyed. Duringthe day small reinforcements of Spitfires and Blenheims reached the island.52. During the air attacks on our shipping referred to in paragraph 3 the limited force of Spitfires and Hurricanes available was continuously in action.In one of these attacks by 30 Ju. 88s heavily escorted by fighters, our fighterseither destroyed or seriously damaged 16 of the attackers.53. Other targets attacked during the week were Halfar, Luqa, GrandHarbour and the submarine bases. Considerable damage to property resultedand there were a number of service and civilian casualties. Fourteen of our aircraft were destroyed on the ground and 34 others were damaged.54. In all a total of thirty-one enemy aircraft were shot down and a greater number damaged.  Nearly half of these enemy casualties were caused by A.A. fire.Greece and Crete.55. Wellingtons made night attacks on landing grounds in Crete and southern Greece.56. The submarine base, and port facilities and shipping at Salamis were bombed by eight Wellingtons, causing a large explosion and some fires on thequay.Sea Communications.57. Naval aircraft attacked a south-bound convoy off Messina. Hits with torpedoes were believed to have been obtained on a merchant vessel of 2,000 tonsand a cruiser. The convoy was seen to turn back towards Messina.Russia.58. There is no information of special interest concerning air operations onthe Russian Front.
Burma.59. Blenheims, Hurricanes and American Tomahawks attacked the aero-dromes at Mingaladon, Moulmein and Chiengmai. In these operations, at least41 enemy aircraft were destroyed or damaged on the ground. In addition, two enemy fighters were shot down, and a further three were probably destroyed in combat.Other targets attacked were Hmawbi (where a number of fires were started),and shipping at Yandoon and Moulmein.60. The main weight of the enemy attack was concentrated on the aerodromes at Magwe and Akyab. At the former, which was subjected to fiveraids, almost all aircraft of the two and a half squadrons located there were either destroyed or damaged. Akyab aerodrome was attacked three times by atotal of 80 bombers with fighter escort, and nine of our aircraft were destroyed and a further six were damaged on the ground. In addition, an ammunitiondump was hit and a hangar demolished.Our fighters shot down four enemy aircraft, probably destroyed three and damaged many others.   Five of our aircraft were lost but two pilots are safe.Pacific Zone.61. Fortresses and Hudsons bombed the aerodrome at Lae, destroying15 aircraft and damaging five on the ground. Hits were also made on an ammunition dump.In the course of two attacks on Koepang, large fives were started on the aerodrome, and buildings and barracks in the town were hit.A Fortress dropped bombs on the runway at Vunakanau, and probably destroyed two enemy fighters in combat.62. A total of 50 enemy aircraft made four attacks on Port Moresby, but,apart from two Tomahawks destroyed on the ground, no serious damage isreported. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed and a further two were probably destroyed by fighters and A.A. fire.Small-scale attacks were made by enemy aircraft on Tulagi (SolomonIslands), Beru (Gilbert Islands), and Florida Island (Solomon Islands).Australia^63. A total of 19 enemy aircraft attacked the aerodromes at Broome, Derbyand Wyndham. A civil, aircraft was destroyed on the ground at Broome, andsome damage was done to the runway at Wyndham.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.64. There was only one minor incident at Newhaven. where two people were killed.By Night.65. Bombs were dropped along the South and South-East Coasts on sixnights during the week, on five of which only insignificant damage was caused andthere were no casualties.On the night of 23rd/24th March Dover was bombed and 14 people were killed and 7 seriously injured. Twenty-six houses were wrecked and public utilities were affected. Bombs also fell at Portland, where some damage was done to house property, but there were only two casualties.Casualties.66.
