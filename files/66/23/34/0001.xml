naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Strong Japanese naval forces, including battleships and aircraft-carriers, have been operating in the Bay of Bengal. Carrier-borne aircraft have caused severe losses among H.M. ships, including two 8-inch cruisers and a smallaircraft-carrier. Naval bases in Ceylon and merchant shipping at sea have alsobeen attacked.Heavy air raids on Malta have caused considerable damage to naval units.Shipping losses reported have been comparatively light.Home Waters.2. The Norwegian s.s. Lind (461 tons), which left Gothenburg on the31st March, has arrived at a British port.The American Battleship Washington, Aircraft-Carrier Wasp, 8-inch cruisers Wichita and Tuscaloosa, with six destroyers, arrived at Scapa onthe 4th.The officers&apos; mess, W.R.N.S. Headquarters and R.N. sick quarters were damaged by blast during an air raid on Dover on the 3rd.Northern Waters.3. Kola Inlet and Murmansk were twice raided by enemy aircraft on the3rd. A divisional headquarters was destroyed and three merchant ships were damaged.Mediterranean.4. Heavy air raids on Malta on the 4th, 5th and 8th caused the followingcasualties : On the 4th the Greek Submarine Glaucos was sunk and H.M. CruiserPenelope, H.M. Destroyer Lance and H.M. Minesweeper A bingdon were damaged.On the 5th H.M. Destroyers Gallant and Kingston were damaged; the formerhad to be beached. H.M. Ships Lance and A bingdon were again seriously damaged.   There was considerable damage to the dockyard.On the 8th there was extensive damage to the harbour area. Kingston receiveda direct hit, which did not explode, a tug was sunk and an Admiralty oiler andtwo minesweeping trawlers damaged.  Admiralty House was largely demolished.In an air raid on Alexandria on the 8th H.M. Minesweeper Svana and h.M. Whaler Thorgrim were sunk.H.M. Destroyer Havock ran aground on the north-east coast of Tunis onthe 6th, and as it was impossible to refloat her she was destroyed. One ratingwas killed, and the remainder of the crew, including five wounded, were reportedto be on shore.On the 7th the hospital ship Somersetshire (9,716 tons) was damaged by a mine or torpedo off the Libyan coast, but was able to proceed. There were nowounded on board at the time.A French report states that the crews of H.M. Motor Launches Nos. 129and 132, which were presumed lost on passage from Gibraltar to Malta, havebeen interned in Algeria, having arrived after an engagement with italian aircraft, in which one motor launch was sunk.During the week 15,990 tons of French shipping westbound and 3.894 tonseastbound have passed through the Straits of Gibraltar under escort.Indian *Ocean.5. In an. attack by American aircraft on enemy shipping at Port Blair onthe night of the 2nd, one cruiser is reported to have been set on fire and a troopshipand two other ships damaged.In the afternoon (local time) of the 4th a Catalina aircraft located a largeenemy force, which was later estimated to contain three battleships and four aircraft carriers, 360 miles S.S.E. of Ceylon, steering to the north-westward.At 0800 on the 5th, during an air attack from the aircraft carriers on Colombo,H.M. Destroyer Tenedos, which was under repair, was rendered a total loss, H.M.Armed Merchant Cruiser Hector was set on fire and the submarine depot-shipLucia was slightly damaged.   Casualties were slight.H.M. Cruisers Cornwall and Dorsetshire, which had left Colombo in the afternoon of the 4th to join Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet, to the south-
westward, were attacked and sunk by about fifty enemy dive-bombers while on passage. Each aircraft carried one large bomb, and the attack was made ingroups of three. Both ships were hit by the first salvo and sank within fifteenminutes ofter explosions in the magazines. There were 1,122 survivors, includingboth captains. The naval force under the command of Commander-in-Chief, -Eastern Fleet, left their base on the 4th and proceeded to the eastward, but failedto make contact with the enemy.In the morning of the 6th shipping was attacked at various points off theeast coast of India between Calcutta and Vizagapatam by enemy naval forces,which included ia&amp;fektesfe&amp;^as, aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers.An enemy force of battleships and aircraft-carriers was sighted byreconnaissance aircraft to the eastward of Ceylon, p.m. on the 8th : and thefollowing morning Trincomalee was attacked by a large force of carrier-borne aircraft. Some damage was done in the harbour and one merchant vessel was hit.H.M. Aircraft Carrier Hermes, with H.M. Australian Destroyer Vampire,H.M. Corvette Hollyhock and eight fleet auxiliaries, which had left Trincomaleein the evening of the 8th, was attacked and sunk by dive-bombers when about50 miles to the southward of Trincomalee at 0700 on the 9th. It is feared thatVampire, Hollyhock and possibly the tanker A thelstane (5,571 tons) were alsosunk. 200 survivors have been picked up. Six of the auxiliaries have returnedto Trincomalee.Pacific Ocean.6. American submarines report having sunk two. laden enemy tankerssouth of the Carolines on the 4th.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. Attacks on U-boats have been made by surface craft off the AmericanAtlantic coast, to the southward of Freetown, by an American destroyer off theHebrides and by a Russian destroyer off the North Russian coast.Aircraft, including four American aircraft, have carried out eleven attacks;two in the Bay of Biscay, three in the Mediterranean and six off the AmericanAtlantic coast.Hits were claimed in one attack in the Mediterranean, but in no case was there evidence of destruction.Enemy Intelligence.8. Air reconnaissance on the 8th showed the Tirpitz, Scheer, Hipper andPrinz Eugen still in Trondheim Fiord.U-boats.9. TJ-boats have continued to be active, though to a less extent than of late,in the area between Cape Hatteras, Bermuda and Nantucket. There has alsobeen some activity in the Caribbean Sea and south of the Liberian coast. MoreU-boats have been operating in Norwegian waters, and it is estimated thattwenty-three German U-boats are in the Mediterranean. Japanese U-boats havebeen active to the south of Ceylon.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the 8th April, 1,036 ships, including 272 allied and 36 neutral, were convoyed. Four anti-aircraft ships, 66 destroyers (including13 American destroyers) and 73 sloops, corvettes and minesweepers were employedon escort duties. During the month of March 4,192 ships were convoyed, of whichsix were lost by enemy action.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the4th April totalled 606,000 tons compared with 1,006,000 tons during theprevious seven days, and an average of 643,700 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 191,000 tons were oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Trade.11. According to the information at present available, thirteen ships,including eight tankers, have been attacked by U-boats during the week, nine in[23683] b 2
the West Atlantic and West Indies, three off Ceylon and one off the LiberianCoast; of these, only four are known to have been sunk. Two British ships were sunk by Japanese surface craft in the Bay of Bengal. Three ships were damaged by aircraft in Murmansk and one was sunk by a mine in the Bristol ChannefBritish Minelaying.12. During the week aircraft have laid mines off the German North Seacoast, in the Bay of Biscay and off Benghazi.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.13. Enemy aircraft over the Thames Estuary are suspected of laying mineson three nights of this week, and also off the Ilumber on the night of the 7th/8th.A number of mines destroyed off the East Coast are believed to have been laidrecently by E-boats.The mine totals are : 1,966 magnetic, 1,258 acoustic, 1,116 moored mines.Enemy Merchant Shipping.14. Four Italian merchant ships engaged in the repatriation of non-combatant Italians from East Africa have arrived and left Gibraltar during theweek.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.Finland.15. Continued German air attacks have caused some damage at Murmansk.Central Sector.16. Local Russian attacks and German counter-attacks have resulted in no appreciable territorial change. Russian attempts to strengthen the isolatedlocalities, which they have captured behind the German forward defences northand south of the Smolensk-Moscow railway, have probably met with some success.Ukraine.17. Local Russian attacks east of Kharkov and in the Donets and Taganrogareas have not caused any change in the general situation in this sector.Summary.18. While Russian attacks have gained little ground, they have prevented the Germans from disengaging formations for rest. The prevailing thaw,however, is probably limiting the scope of operations on the whole front and may give the Germans some opportunity for resting and refitting.Libya.19. Normal patrol activity continued throughout the week and some smallengagements took place.On the 6th April an advance by three enemy columns began at dawn (a) The main thrust south-east through Bir Temrad to Sidi Breghisc(5 miles south-east of Bir Temrad).(&amp;) By a route further south to Sidi Breghisc.(c) From the Mekili area towards El Telim (31 miles north-west of BirHakeim).The combined strength of the first two columns was 80 tanks and 100 M.T.The third column consisted of 20 tanks and 50 M.T.In the evening one of our columns was ordered forward to engage 100 M.T.in the areas north and west of Bir Temrad and patrols were sent to investigate the Sidi Breghisc area.20. During the 7th the enemy were digging in at Bir Temrad and SidiBreghisc. An enemy column including 100 tanks moved from El Cherima(19 miles south-west of Gazala) to a point 12 miles south of Gazala and 50 tanks and 300 M.T. were observed in the area south-west of El Cherima. Our artilleryshelled enemy guns and M.T. 3 miles north-west of Bir Temrad and our armoured
car patrols were in contact with enemy patrols. The enemy made no attempt toreconnoitre our positions.Burma.Irrawaddy Front.21. On the morning of the 1st April the enemy attacked Prome in consider-able strength and secured the high ground to the south of the town. Fighting-continued during the night and the following day, when our forces withdrew topositions just north of Prome.22. During the 3rd and 4th our withdrawal continued. The enemy followed up strongly but were successfully dealt with and our troops took up positions on the Bwetkyi Chaung just south of Allanmyo. During the 4th enemy action was confined to bombing and air reconnaissance, but owing to the fatigue of our troops it was decided to withdraw to the area Glinban Chaung (60 miles north of Prome). This withdrawal was carried out on the night of the 5th/6th afterthe oilfields, power station and cement factory in Thayetmyo had been successfullydemolished. Allanmyo and Thayetmyo were fired after all our supplies, ammu-nition and fuel had been removed.23. A strong enemy column has been located at Nyaung Binzeik withelements moving north-east. Another enemy column is reported on the west bankof the Irrawaddy, 10 miles north of Kama.Sittang Front.24. North of Toungoo the Chinese have taken up a defensive position in theSwa-Yedashe area, where heavy fighting is going on. East of Toungoo theJapanese are now about 30 miles west of Mawchi, which is held by the Chinese.The Karen levies have been completing demolitions and holding up this Japaneseadvance.General.25. The British and Chinese have suffered from a severe lack of air support and have been constantly dive-bombed and machine-gunned.Indian Ocean.26. On the 30th/31st March an unopposed enemy landing took place on christmas Island.Netherlands East Indies.27. The Dutch Headquarters in Australia reports that guerillas in Javaare maintaining an active resistance.Pacific Islands.New Guinea.28. There is no indication of a renewal of the advance from Huon Gulfarea on Port Moresby but the enemy are reported to have occupied points in west (Dutch) New Guinea.Solomon Islands.29. The enemy has made further landings on Bougainville Island and hasshelled and occupied Faisi Island.Intelligence.France and the Low Countries.30. The eastward movement of forces from France, coupled with their replacement by troops returning from Russia, is believed to be continuing; two more divisions have been reported as about to move from France. The estimated total of divisions remains at 26 in France and three in the Low Countries.Italy.31. A further new Italian infantry division has been identified in theAncona area.  This brings the total number of Italian divisions identified to 77.
Bulgaria.32. There are still no indications of any impending military action byBulgarian forces. It is, however, reported that a call-up was carried out during march, which involved as many as 100,000 men. The addition of these recruitsbrings the Bulgarian forces almost to their full mobilisation strength of about370,000.AIR SITUATION.General Review.33. The Matford Works, at Poissy, was successfully attacked by aircraft of Bomber Command.Enemy attacks on Malta were intensified and caused widespread damage.Japanese aircraft attacked Colombo Harbour and Trincomalee.United Kingdom.34.   Fighter Command flew 2,479 sorties by day and 449 by night.Enemy activity against this country was on a small scale. By day, someoffensive operations were carried out by fighter bombers and two attacks weremade on a R.A.F. station near Swanage.Eighteen enemy aircraft were reported overland in daylight and 48 at night.Night fighers shot down three enemy bombers and probably destroyedanother.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.35. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 541 and 12 offensive sorties respectively.36. The railway junction at St. Omer was attacked by Bostons, escorted by14 squadrons of Spitfires. Bombing results were not observed, but the fighter escort encountered large numbers of enemy fighters five of which were destroyed,three probably destroyed and ten damaged for the loss of eleven Spitfires.Following on this attack several squadrons of Spitfires gave support to Air SeaRescue searches in the Straits.37. Five fighter sweeps involving a total of 25 squadrons of Spitfires were carried out during the week over the coastal areas of North-West France, butmet with very little opposition.   One Spitfire was lost.Night.38. Bomber Command despatched 834 sorties against land targets. Themain weight of the attack involving a total of 692 aircraft was directed againstCologne, Essen and Hamburg, but on each night extremely bad weather condi-tions were encountered, and numerous aircraft were forced to abandon their primary task.   From these three attacks, fifteen bombers are missing.39. At Cologne, the early arrivals attacked in fair visibility, whichrapidly deteriorated. Numerous fires were observed in the town, and a power station north-east of the town was seen to be burning. About 313 tons of H.E.and incendiaries were dropped in this attack.Essen and Hamburg were attacked in very bad weather conditions. Apartfrom scattered fires, results were not observed. About 340 tons of bombs were dropped.40. The most successful operation of the week was a medium scale attackon the Matford Works at Poissy, which is engaged in the production of&apos; motor transport vehicles for Germany. About 100 tons of H.E. were dropped inexcellent visibility, and both the factory and the adjacent power station were left in flames.41. At Gennevilliers (Paris) the Gnome and Rhone Works, which manu-factures aero-engines was subjected to a small scale attack in good weather conditions. Numerous fires are reported, particularly in a subsidiary factorysituated to the east of the main works.
42. About 75 tons of H.E. were dropped during three attacks on the docks at Havre.43. Leaflets were released over Northern France and Belgium by a total of24 aircraft.44. Fighter Command despatched a total of 42 aircraft to patrol enemy aerodromes. Bombs were dropped at Lille, Conches, Beauvais, Evreux,Eindhoven and Fouville.   A He. Ill was destroyed whilst landing at Evreux.Coastal Operations.45. Coastal Command flew 381 sorties, and an additional 49 sorties onconvoy escorts. Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 1,231sorties.46. Bomber Command despatched 21 aircraft by day to lay sea mines off the frisian Islands, and a total of 54 aircraft operated by night on similar operations in Quiberon Bay and off Heligoland. Sixty-nine mines were laid. Two aircraft are missing.   .47. A number of attacks on enemy shipping were made during the week,but no sinkings are claimed. A 5,000-ton merchant vessel was hit with a torpedooff Obrestad. Following a low-level bombing attack two columns of smoke were seen issuing amidships from a 6,000-ton vessel off Statland. Two hits with bombs are estimated on a 3,000-ton vessel off Katwijk. Spitfires attacked three trawler-type vessels.48. Beaufighters covering the escape of Norwegian shipping from Sweden(vide paragraph 3 of Resume No. 135), destroyed three enemy aircraft and damaged a further three without loss.49. About 60 enemy aircraft carried out shipping and weather reconnais-sances off our coasts. A total of about 75 enemy aircraft were engaged in sea-mining.Mediterranean.Libya and Egypt.50. Two daylight attacks were made on Derna aerodrome by Bostons escorted by fighters. Enemy fighter opposition was encountered but all our bombersreturned safely. In combats with our fighters three enemy aircraft were destroyed, seven probably destroyed and eight damaged, for the loss of twoKittyhawks.Attacks were also made by escorted light bombers on enemy M.T. columnsadvancing in the Bir Temrad area.51. Fighters carried out offensive sweeps over the forward areas and also provided patrols to protect our shipping. A force of 20 Ju. 87s with fighter escort was intercepted whilst attacking a convoy near Tobruk; three enemy aircraft were shot down, one probably destroyed, and eight damaged for a lossof four fighters.52.   The harbour installations and shipping at Benghazi were bombed by wellingtons on each night and sea-mines were laid in the Harbour.The landing grounds at Berca and Derna were also attacked.53. Hurricanes carried out a series of night patrols over the forward areas and attacked enemy transport vehicles with bombs and machine-gun fire.54. Enemy activity was not on a large scale. Small formations of long-range bombers made two night attacks on one of our landing grounds near Dhaba(Egypt) but caused negligible damage. On one day the enemy carried out anumber of offensive sweeps over our forward landing grounds and two Kittyhawkswere shot down.55. Two night raids were made on Alexandria by 20 and 16 enemy bombersrespectively. Some damage was caused to a quay, to small naval units and to civilian property. A Beaufighter shot down two enemy aircraft and A.A. fireprobably destroyed one more.
Malta.56. Enemy bombing of the Island was intensified, the number of sortiesreaching the unprecedented total of 1,562. The heaviest attack was on 7th April,when 318 enemy aircraft were engaged.57. Attacks were concentrated on Grand Harbour and Valetta, on the aerodromes at Hal Far, Luqa and Takali, and on the seaplane base at Kalafrana.The damage was extensive and included considerable destruction of civilianproperty. Seven aircraft were destroyed on the ground and eleven others damaged. It was noticeable, however, that there was a marked decrease in the accuracy of the enemy bombing.58. The small number of available fighters intercepted the enemy on every possible occasion and destroyed 14 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed nine moreand damaged 25 others, with very few losses to themselves. In addition,anti-aircraft fire destroyed 25, probably destroyed another and damaged 18 more.Russia.German Air Force Operations.59. The German Air Force on the Russian Front continues to receivereinforcements and it is considered that the force now engaged consists ofapproximately 2,000 IE. aircraft compared with the force of 1,600 aircraft operating at the beginning of the year. A large proportion of the reinforcementsare believed to comprise units which have again become operational after a periodof overhaul and rest following their withdrawal from Russia at the end of 1941.60. The thaw, which has now extended to a large area of the front, is likelyto affect the serviceability of aerodromes. It is believed that the averageserviceability of units in Russia remains low and consequently the scale of effort by the present force is likely to be substantially below that achieved by theG.A.F. under normal conditions.61. Several attacks have been made on Murmansk and on convoys byformations of Ju.87&apos;s, Me.ll0&apos;s and Ju.88&apos;s, operating from Northern Norway.Little damage has been caused to shipping but some hits were made on portinstallations.62. Operations on the remainder of the front appear to have been confinedmainly to close support of the land forces in resisting Russian attacks. Long-range bomber operations have been directed against railway communications,which have assumed increased importance owing to the difficulties of roadtransportation under thaw conditions. Russian air forces have maintained a heavy scale of attack against the German-occupied aerodromes and communica-tions in this area.Ceylon.63. On the 5th, about 75 enemy aircraft, chiefly fighters carrying bombs and some dive-bombers, operating from aircraft carriers, attacked the harbour at Colombo and the aerodrome at Ratmalana. On shore, the harbour workshipswere destroyed and some damage was caused to the railway workshops.Thirty-three Hurricanes and naval Fulmars were airborne, and thesedestroyed 23 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed five and seriously damagedmany others. A further two aircraft were shot down by A.A. Our losses were14 Hurricanes, four Fulmars, three Catalinas and two naval Swordfish, but someof the personnel are safe.64. On the morning of the 9th, 27 enemy bombers and a large number of fighters attacked Trincomalee. Preliminary reports indicate that considerable damage was caused to hangars and buildings at China Bay, and a large fire,probably oil, was started. Seven enemy aircraft were reported destroyed. SevenHurricanes and one naval Fulmar are missing.65. Nine Blenheims were despatched to attack the enemy naval forceand claim three near misses on an aircraft carrier.  Five Blenheims are missing.
[23683]cIndia.66. On the 3rd, six American Fortresses carried out their first operation from Indian territory and attacked enemy shipping at Port Blair ^AndamanIslands).   One cruiser and a transport were set on fire.67. In the Bay of Bengal, our fighters intercepted enemy aircraft whichwere attacking merchant shipping and damaged three float-planes.. 68. Other raids were made by Japanese aircraft on the harbours atVizagapatam and Cocanada.Burma.69. No reports have been received of any air operations by the R.A.F. orAllied aircraft.70. Bombing by the Japanese has been maintained consistently throughoutthe week. At Mandalay, parts of the town and the base supply depot were burnt out, and at Yamethin the railway station was destroyed. Akyab aerodrome wasraided four times in two days by a total of 36 aircraft and the aerodrome was rendered temporarily unserviceable.71. Other attacks were made on Thazi, Pyinmana, the Pade-Sindok valley,Taungwingyi (twice), and on Maymyo, where the hangar and remount depotwere damaged.   The landing ground at Loiwing was machine-gunned.Pacific Zone.72. Successful attacks were made on the aerodromes at Koepang and Laeby R.A.A.F. and American aircraft, respectively. At the former six enemy air-craft were destroyed, eight were probably destroyed, and six were damaged, all onthe ground. At Lae five aircraft were set on fire, at least ten more were badly damaged, and bombs fell among a group of six fighters.73. American bombers attacked the runway at Salamoa, the aerodromes atGasmata and Vunakanau, and shipping at Rabaul. No definite results are reported.Australia.74. There have been three attacks on Darwin, and two attacks on port moresby aerodromes, but no serious damage resulted. Of the total of 30 bombers and 26 fighters engaged in these attacks, six aircraft were destroyed, two were probably destroyed and two were damaged.  Our losses were four Tomahawks.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.75.   Bombs have been dropped (a) On the Gloucester Aircraft Factory and on the adjacent R.A.F. aero-drome.(b) At Bognor Regis.(c) On a telecommunications experimental establishment on two occasions.Damage was nowhere extensive but there were a number of casualties.By Night.76. On the night of the 2nd/3rd bombs were dropped on the coasts of Dorsetand Kent. Considerable damage was done to house property at Weymouth andDover. Utility services were affected and casualties were comparatively heavy.On the following nights bombs were dropped in Dorset and Somerset withouteffect and on the night of 7th/8th there was scattered bombing in the easterncoastal areas and slight damage was done at Grimsby docks.Casualties.77. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours on the8th April are 55 killed and 104 seriously injured, the majority occurring atWeymouth and Dover on the night of the 2nd/3rd.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from Air Reconnaissance and Intelligence services : Germany.Kiel. Photographs taken on the 29th March, 1942, show : (i) Damage to a building at the Deutsche Werke and to the jetty leading tothe northern floating dock;(ii) Two buildings in a works reported to be making torpedo components and shells have been destroyed; and(iii) Additional damage to residential property on the east and west sides of the town.Dortmund. Further details of the damage caused on the 10th/11th march to the Hoesch Iron and Steel Works have been received. A machine assembly shed,a lathe shed, the main smithy, a large warehouse, the despatch department andadjoining office buildings were all seriously damaged.On the same night a large bomb fell near the main station causing damage tothe station itself as well as to surrounding buildings.Occupied France.Poissy. Photographs taken on the 6th April, 1942, are of very poor quality and prevent any detailed interpretation being made. It is, however, clear thatthe Matford Works have been severely damaged both b)&apos; H.E. and fire. Inaddition, factories lying to the south and south-west of the works have been damaged, in some cases severely, and it is believed that the transformer stationhas been affected.Le Trait. -Photographs taken the day after the recent attack on the ship-yards confirm the success of the attack and show that considerable damage hasbeen caused. Most of the important workshops have sustained varying degrees of damage as well as at least one of the slipways. From the position of certaincraters seen on the photographs, it would also be reasonable to assume that considerable damage has been done by blast to the interior of the workshops,which is not otherwise apparent upon the photographs.St. Nazaire. Photographs taken on 25th March show that damage causedbetween 1st January, 1942, and that date was almost entirely confined to the dock area, where important workshops have been destroyed or damaged.
