Printed for the War Cabinet, Afiril, 1942W.P. (42) 167MOST SECRET18th April, 1942.Copy No.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINETRELEASE OF* EX-MINERS FROM THE army memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on 10th April, 1942 (Minute 1Conclusion (v)) I was asked to &quot;furnish particulars of the units of the field force at Home in which ex-miners, whose release was sought, are now serving,distinguishing in particular between fighting units and ancillary services&quot;.2. I append a table showing, by arms, the numbers of ex-miners serving in the Field Force at Home on 4th April, 1942, and I have sub-divided these numbers into the arms commonly regarded as fighting arms and those whichmay be termed ancillary arms of the service. I have no information to show how many of these are face-workers, nor could this be obtained without con-siderable effort and delay.I have classified these numbers of ex-miners by arms of the service, andnot by units; there are 3,800 separate units in the Field Force, and in the greatmajority of these units the number of ex-miners is under 10, though compara-tively few have no ex-miners at all.I am not in a position to relate the figures in the appended table to those inthe lists which my department have so far received from the Mines Department,and totalling up to nth April, 16,690. These lists classify men by name from individual collieries, and our experience shows that they are so out-of-date thatthe tracing of the men takes a considerable time; in many cases the names areduplicated, and an appreciable portion are found to have been discharged from the army during a period stretching back as far as 1928.P-J.G.The War Office,18th April, 1942.
