Report, dated the31st March, 1942, is circulated to members of the War Cabinet for information.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES, Secretary.Great George Street, S.W. 1,April 5, 1942.some Remarks made by Japanese Diplomats and Attaches in European Capitalsat end of February.THE war in the Far East was now a foregone conclusion. No one had expected that England would prove so weak and so passive. During the 2^ yearsof the war the British had not carried out a single serious operation with reallyprepared and concentrated forces.2. The losses suffered by Great Britain in the Far East were important,not only militarily, but politically. A proof of this was the attitude of Siamand the number of Hindu detachments who appeared to have passed over to theJapanese side.3. Naval losses had shown that, although the British Navy fought well,they fought with antiquated methods and without adequate co-operation and support from other arms.4. Japan would not take too much. The capture of Singapore and thepossibility of the Japanese Fleet entering the Indian Ocean, as well as the liquidation of British, American and Dutch forces on the remaining islands ofthe Archipelago, would allow Japan to organise defensive bases and to liquidatethe Chinese problem.5. The Japanese are following a similar policy to that of Soviet Russia;that is, they received counsels from their allies, but kept their own military measures in complete secrecy. This policy had admirably justified itself, for japan&apos;s opponents had been completely surprised by the extent of her prepara-tions. The Japanese added to this : &quot; We know very well that on the one handour great ally Germany is exceedingly pleased with our remarkable, well-prepared and calculated victories. On the other hand, they are worried lest it may be uswho will say the decisive word in the decision of the war against Russia and,indeed, of the whole war generally, and are afraid lest after the war we becometoo strong.&quot;[23661]
6. Should the German&apos; offensive in Russia prove successful, then the questionof Japanese-German co-operation would arise.7.   The Japanese would not wait till the Allies had mobilised real strength in the Pacific.  The intention was to conclude peace at an early date, which wouldbe quite easy, as if the British and the Americans suffered further territoriallosses, their Parliaments would raise a howl and would change their Governments or their policy.8. Hong Kong, in point of fact, defended itself bravely to the end againstsuperior Japanese strength. The Filipinos strike the Japanese as very goodsoldiers and are admired. Singapore was an English scandal. The Generalcommanding was a weakling who, at the decisive moment, lost his head. the preparations for the defence of Singapore were carried out literally at the lastminute. The Japanese losses were relatively very small, because 99 per cent, ofthe garrison surrendered almost without fighting.9. &quot;It is essential at any price to force a final decision as early as possible,both in Europe and in the Far East, and at the very latest before the spring of 1943.&quot;Comment.The remark in paragraph 7, indicating that Japan would attempt to makepeace as soon as they had consolidated their position in the Burma, Malay,-Netherlands East Indies line, may well have been her original policy. The easeof her conquests has probably whetted her appetite for more. Also the quotationin paragraph 9 saying an early peace is essential is of interest.
