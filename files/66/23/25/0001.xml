Causes of Failure.(a) Prime cause low morale Indian troops.   Due-&apos;1.   Eastern races less able to withstand strain modern war.2.   Lack attention by officers to deliberate building troops&apos; morale, viz.,troops quartered in camps in rubber plantations never saw sunlight.3.   Homesickness and lack of entertainment.(b) Lack of offensive spirit retreat complex.1. Many commanders and senior officers imbued with retreat complex.Spirit of resignation prevailed.2. Repeatedly slightest enemy opposition checked our local offensives.Many withdrawals without pressure from enemy. In short, lack of spiritin junior officers:[23659] B
(c) Poor quality of staff work. Especially in certain departmentse:g., ordnance, also 3rd Indian Corps. Broadly, staffs too cumbersome, manyofficers inefficient, efficient officers hamstrung by complications of British system.Operations little better than administration, viz., lack of system in obtaining anddisseminating information, no transmitter sets left behind enemy lines. Also,orders frequently given, altered, then cancelled.(d) Lack of air support. Quality and quantity air support inadequate.Undue proportion aircraft lost on aerodromes. Adequate air support could haveprotected navy, thus obstructing coastal landings. Immediately previous assault on island, enemy able to make perfect reconnaissance defence positions under construction.(e) Wishful thinking. ^2nd December Malaya Command advised no likelihood-hood Japanese attack. Reports promulgated among formations under-estimatedenemy.(f) Training neglected. Training in jungle fighting, patrols, &amp;c. neglected.(g) Lack appreciation effect climatic conditions on stamina.(h) Poor quality 18th British Division.Part 2. Tactics.(a) British.1. Weak because unable pro vide relief fighting troops from reserves,thus avoiding fatigue.2.   Existence of retreat complex.3.   Absence of offensive spirit due to 1 and 2.(b) Amplification of press statements reference 1918 text book methods.1. In 1918 British method attacking position pound it heavily withartillery until opposition reduced, then advance under artillery barrage.Since 1939 this method obsolete, yet large conservative element officersadhered such obsolete methods. Repeatedly commanders adhered rigidmethods of defence.2. Beach defence systems provided long thin line posts along beachwithout depth with vulnerable flanks whereas modern perimeter system ofdefence on shorter flank much more effective.(c) Japanese tactics.1.   Infiltration and outflanking.2. Through above enemy established forces which coalesced into largergroups behind our lines, causing withdrawal due rigid system defence and morale. - .3. Soft spot tactics avoiding frontal attack or close contact where possible.4. Tricks use of noise to induce terror, especially behind positions at night. , 11 , , ^, .   ,   , x -    ^5.   Use of fishing craft to advance along coastline by night.6.   Leapfrogging methods used to keep troops fresh.7.   Aircraft not used by night.Part 3. Training.Training in jungle, jungle patrols neglected. Unlike Japanese noappreciation many British commanders that different conditions requireddifferent tactics. Too much emphasis on barrack square training. Lack of equipment accompanying earlier units affected standard reached.Part .4. Organisation.Seven. Bren carriers per battalion sufficient in this terrain. Mortars 3-inchmost useful infantry * weapon. Establishment reduced minimum provideconcentration fire. A.I.F. Mechanical Transport with infantry reduced 50 percent. Anti-Tank guns needed in forward posts, transport suitably provided byBren carriers. Artillery equipment could be varied. Rarely whole regimentrequired to support brigade. Large number wheeled vehicles burden. A.I.F-patrols stripped to minimum. Gas capes Jioods discarded altogether, gas masksstored B echelon vehicles. . A.I.F.. by reducing infantry equipment, increased
\numbers fighting infantry. Re-organisation Headquarters Company providedextra platoon. Surplus&apos; battalion transport, mortars carrier personnel andaddition of half first reinforcements enabled fourth rifle platoon be added eachcompany.   Such rifle fire power badly needed.Part 5. Equipment.1. British equipment unsuitable, following war establishments instead ofbeing adapted to climatic conditions.2. Japanese equipfnent suitable. Comprised light automatic weapons, lightmortars, no artillery except what was captured. Transport just sufficient to meetneeds and not clutter roads and prevent movement. British too mechanically-minded.3. Japanese infantry clothed suitably, travelled light and used bicycles..18th British Division went into battle full equipment, troops worn out infew hours.4.   British technical equipment weak, especially signal equipment.Part 6. Problem of Defence of Singapore Island.Decision to defend from positions far away from island itself sound.Decision to forestall enemy landing Singora and Patani by sending expeditionfrom Kedah unsound, because Japanese would occupy towns prior casus belli.Insufficient troops undertake operation successfully. Wrong to absorb onlyreserve for this task.Part 7. Defences Constructed during Campaign.1. It must have been anticipated retreat which commenced 7th Decemberwould end on Singapore Island. When troops reached island 30th January they found no defences prepared except those prior to hostilities.2. Work immediately begun to install beach lights, beach guns (mostlytaken from Mersing), and construct posts, obstacles.3. No doubt Singapore Island shouldjhave been strongly fortified against attack from mainland. Strong perimeters,&quot;support and reserve positions could have been prepared.Part 8. Own and Enemy Casualties.(a) Own 1. Difficult to assess because nature of country facilitated isolation of units.When attacked, parties were often surrounded and following subsequentdisintegration survivors broke off fight and made back to mother unit, sometimestaking days. Missing personnel thus continually reappeared. Meanwhile, unitsreported casualties &quot;as heavy, also as units withdrew wounded, killed and missingwere left behind, many of whom were never recovered. Some units suffered heavy casualties by desertion. At first deserters were collected and returned units,1towards the end this impracticable as morale low.2. 11th February, A.I.F. casualties were approximately 7,000 killedor missing, while approximately 2,000 in hospital. Impossible to estimate totalcasualties till enemy report number of prisoners.3.   White population suffered heavily.(b) Enemy 1.   Impossible even to guess total casualties inflicted on enemy.2.   In Gemas battle conservatively estimated 1,000 killed.3.   Throughout retirement, A.I.F. inflicted losses in many counter-attacks.:4.   At Bakri enemy also severely punished.Part 9. Conduct of Defence of Singapore Island.n. A Defences of island divided into three sectors. Eastern 11th indian division. Western A.I.F., and 44th Indian Brigade, Southern, troops from singapore defences. 3rd Indian Corps consisting 18th British Division andremnants of 9th Indian Division in reserve.2. Work immediately commenced preparing positions. Soon realised coast-hne could only be held thinly.[23659] B 2
3. Night 4th/5th February, patrol encountered large enemy concentrationsmainland overlooking straits Johore.4. 7th February, enemy aircraft and artillery started bombardment.Concentrated attention on headquarters and roa,ds western sector. Due effectiveair reconnaissance, communications cut. Defences destroyed. Information that night enemy had landed large force.  Two battalions holding position overrun.5. Reserves thrown in to counter-attack, but unable to stem enemy advance.New line between Sungei Kranji and Sungei Jurong formed.6. Further enemy landing and continuous pressure forced line back to road between Bukit Panjong and Bukit Timah villages.7. After conference with General Wavell line to be pushed forward easystages on 11th and 12th February. This impossible. Enemy tanks firstencountered on island. Thorn force, which attacked morning 12th February,ended up well behind starting line.8. A.I.F. and remnants 2nd/15th Indian Brigade formed perimeter vicinityReformatory Road. To right, Thorn force held racecourse. * To left, 44th IndianBrigade and fortress troops extended line to Pasir Panjang.9. Decided hold reservoirs if possible. Understood enemy then landedsomewhere northern sector and force line back reservoir.10. Thorn force fell back further. Australians remained in position, whichheld to end with battalion 2nd Gordons.   On left, 44th Brigade melted away.11. Meanwhile &quot;enemy aircraft concentrated on city, causing heavy casualties.12. 13th February. First conference Fort Canning. Commanders eachgave opinion further resistance useless. Pei&apos;cival suggested attack, but possiblescale rendered useless, and arrangements made to evacuate specialists.13. 14th and 15th, situation worse. City surrounded, plight populationmost serious.14. 15th February. Second conference. Commanders confirmed previousopinion. Decided suggest hostilities cease that day, and ask if sufficient troops could remain under arms to preserve order. Destruction technical equipmentdiscussed left to unit commanders to implement.15. At 2030 hours the cessation of hostilities ordered Japanese allowed1,000 men remain under arms.Part 10. Japanese Forces on Singapore Island.In first attack on island it seems enemy used one division against positionsheld by two battalions north-west sector island. Having created gap, he pouredtroops this division towards Bukit Timah village. Believed elements second division also pushed through this sector. Simultaneously, enemy were inoccupation Pengerang Peninsula and island Palau Ubin opposite Changi. Later. he appeared on Welau Blakang Mati. These two divisions were identified assame as operated on mainland.Part 11. Guerillas still Fighting On.During operations in mainland many Chinese trained in guerrilla fightingwere passed behind enemy lines. Reported that over 1,000 were still fighting innorthern Malaya when operations ceased. Also large parties Malays from N.E.I.under Dutch officers were operating behind enemy lines. Dumps of food were established beyond Segamat.Part 12. Attitude of Civil Population to Military Authorities.1. Contrary reports that natives were unfriendly, not one case of fifth column activity was reported by A.I.F. Malays, Chinese assisted as guides,provided food boats, &amp;c.2. During campaign in north desertions of Malay volunteers were reported.Men of a Malay regiment contacted by A.I.F. fought as well as Indian troops.3. Civilian population cleared from areas where fighting was expecteddisplayed no antagonism as result.4.   Generally, natives showed disinterestedness in war.5. During aerial bombardment Singapore Chinese showed great stoicism.They, Malays, Indians, provided personnel for fire-fighting ambulance serviceuntil casualties too heavy.
6. Special mention is due to white population for devotion to duty.Volunteer forces displayed great bravery.Part 13. Relations between Civil and Military Authorities.&apos;1. As martial law was proclaimed Singapore civil authorities could not beblamed for shortcomings.2. Civilian labour problem was acute. Labourers often refused unloadships over 24-hour periods; also, scarcity labour accentuated difficultiestowards end.3. Reliably stated that protector of Chinese did not treat themsympathetically.4. His Excellency the Governor, justifiably or not, was adversely criticizedin many quarters.5. A.I.F. found Sultan of Johore most helpful. Although antagonistic toBritish officialdom was not unfriendly to cause.Part 14. Details Effectiveness Demolitions.1. Reports revealed that in beginning campaign destruction of propertyuseful to enemy was not organised, viz., Penang.2. Destruction rubber, machinery, tin. dredges. &amp;c, thoroughly executedlater. Rolling stock, road making plant was generally removed and oil, petroltanks, aerodromes, bridges demolished.3. Accumulation of material removed to Island was not all destroyed.Much of value Was left in naval dockyard.4. Dumps ammunition, petrol, food, were partly demolished by enemy in&apos;-;last phase.5.   Japanese repaired aerodromes and bridges with utmost expedition.6. Scorched earth policy was too enthusiastically applied. Destruction of&apos;dumps, &amp;c, behind our lines visible afar and gave troops feeling that positionswere temporary.Part 15. Conditions, Time of Surrender.(a) Civil population. Civil hospital without water for over 24 hours. Citywater supply exhausted. Impossible collect bombing casualties as fast as caused:Many buildings collapsed on occupants. Insufficient medical aid available.Limited supply of food.(b). Army. Water supply ceased. Only three days&apos; supply rations remained.No artillery ammunition available.   Morale of troops was extremely weak.In conclusion A.I.F. found nothing but full co-operation when staff MalayaCommand was approached.   Relations most friendly throughout.
