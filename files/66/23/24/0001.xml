It will be seen that the President is prepared to acquiesce reluctantlyin our concluding a treaty recognising such Russian frontiers, but that he hopesit may be possible to persuade Stalin to agree that any persons wishing toemigrate from the territories which the Soviet Government propose thus toreoccupy shall be given the opportunity to do so.3. I now propose to inform the Soviet Ambassador that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are ready to negotiate a treaty on the basis desired by Stalin, andthat I should like these negotiations to take place in London, since it will be easier for me if I am in direct charge of the negotiations to decide questionswhich may arise involving points on which American repercussions may be important. Since President Roosevelt intends to invite M. Molotov to pay a visit to Washington, it might be tactful to suggest that M. Molotov should tryso to time his journey as to be able to sign the treaty in London on his way to washington.4. I would invite M Maisky to agree that we should take as the starting point of our discussions the draft treaty which was communicated to. andamended by, Stalin when I was in Moscow. The text of this draft will be foundin Annex II.5. In this draft the first paragraph of article 3 constitutes the text proposedby Stalin in order to embody the undertaking to be given regarding the Sovietpre-war frontiers. It will be necessary to supplement this provision with astipulation to the effect that our recognition of the Soviet Union&apos;s claim to thesefrontiers does not apply to the frontier between Poland and the Soviet Union.Incidentally, I have assured General Sikorski that the proposed treaty will beof benefit to Polish interests, since it will establish the right of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to concern themselves with the future frontier settlement in eastern europe, including the Polish-Russian frontier.6.   It will be desirable to redraft the second part of article 3 of the treatyso as (a) to bring out the fact that in encouraging confederations of States theobject we have in mind is not merely to strengthen their economic and political11681   [23660] b
independence, but also their capacity to defend themselves militarily againstforeign aggression; and (b) to prevent misconceptions on the part of AlliedGovernments and populations, as well as European neutrals generally, as to the role of the Soviet Union in the economic reconstruction of post-war Europe.7. It will also be necessary that we should do our best to persuade the SovietGovernment to agree to the insertion in the treaty of a stipulation which willmeet President Roosevelt&apos;s request that the populations of the territories whichthe Soviet Union is to reoccupy under the treaty shall have the right to emigrate.I fear it will be difficult to persuade Stalin to agree to such a concession, and.even if he does, it has the disadvantage that any attempt on our part to implementit in practice is bound to arouse Soviet ill-feeling and resentment withoutachieving any satisfactory results.8. The Allied Governments and the remaining neutral Governments inEurope will be on the look-out for any suggestion that the Soviet Government isto play a predominant part in the social and economic reconstruction of Europe.They will require, therefore, to be reassured, and I would propose that this shouldbe done (a) by carefully drafting the relevant articles in the treaty itself (seeparagraph 7);(b) by making some reassuring statement at the same time as the treaty is signed;(c) by launching suitable propaganda to counteract the propaganda we may expect from Germany.9. In particular the signature of the treaty is bound to cause anxiety tothe Governments of the States adjacent to the Soviet Union : Poland, certainBalkan States, and Turkey. In order to dispel this anxiety it will be desirablethat agreement should be reached on the following points with the SovietGovernment outside the actual framework of the political treaty : (a) There should be some Anglo-Soviet instrument reaffirming Stalin&apos;declaration in favour of a strong Poland and stating that nothing inthe present treaty conflicts with the assurance given by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the Polish Government at the time of the signature ofthe Polish-Soviet agreement, to the effect that &quot;His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not recognise any territorial changes which have been effected in Poland since August 1939.&quot; I am committed to consultGeneral Sikorski on the subject of the treaty, and I propose to take an early opportunity to inform him of the position and of our intentions. .(&amp;) There should be some Anglo-Soviet instrument in elaboration ofparagraph 2 (a) of article 3 of the treaty to the effect that the soviet and British Governments hope that all the States in the DanubianBasin and the Balkan peninsula will find their place in confederations,for which bases have already been laid in the treaties recently concluded between Czechoslovakia and Poland on the one hand, and yugoslavia and Greece on the other. It is important to obtain sucha statement from Stalin so as to counteract any claim which he might be tempted to make to treat Roumania and Bulgaria as coming within the Russian sphere of influence, and therefore not suitable forabsorption into any Balkan confederation.(c) In order to reassure Turkey it is most important that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Soviet Government should before the signature of the treaty address either joint or simultaneous declarations to theTurkish Government explaining that the motive of the two Govern-ments in concluding the treaty is the better to pursue their commonobject of defeating Germany, and reaffirming to the Turkish Govern-ment in the most solemn manner the assurances of the 10th August,1941. These assurances stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;andthe Soviet Government had no aggressive intentions or claims withregard to the Straits; that they remained faithful to the MontreuxConvention, which regulates the regime of the Straits; that both governments were prepared scrupulously to observe the territorial
integrity of the Turkish Republic; and that both Governments wereprepared to send Turkey every help and assistance in the event of herbeing attacked by any European Power.10. In addition to the political treaty a military treaty was also discussed in Moscow. The draft then prepared is attached as Annex III. It does not giverise to any questions of policy with which I need trouble the Cabinet, but itswording and its relationship with the Anglo-Soviet agreement of July 1941 willrequire further consideration. .11. In order to meet Stalin&apos;s expressed wish I would like authority, if hepresses for it, to agree that the two treaties should be treaties between Heads of states instead of as at present between Governments.12. There is no question of the Dominions being asked to be parties to the treaties.A. E.Foreign Office, April 5, 1942.[ 23660]
ANNEX I.(1)Mr. Eden to Viscount Halifax (Washington).(No. 1960.   Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, March 26, 1942.YOU will have seen from my telegram No. 1899 that President Roosevelfsattempt to move Stalin on the Russian frontier question has been unavailing.We, are therefore faced with a position where we are bound to take a decisionof our own in this matter: I am convinced that we cannot allow it to drag onany further without incurring grave responsibilities and dangers. I feelconvinced, too, that no continuance of the present discussion, either with thePresident or with Stalin, will lead to any satisfactory result, whereas it maywell make it more difficult than it is at present for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto take a decision of their own.2. I fully realise that the President will not like it if we now tell Stalinthat we are prepared to go ahead with our treaty negotiations on the basis ofhis frontier claims, and that in doing so we shall be creating trouble for him with his public opinion. Had circumstances been more favourable I should havenaturally wished to spare him this embarrassment, but things being as they are cannot take the risk of keeping Anglo-Russian relations in a state of suspendedanimation any longer. The war situation has now become too serious for suchdilatory tactics.3. I must ask you therefore to take up the matter at once with the president and speak to him on the lines of my immediately following telegram. before doing so I hope that you will be able to discuss the matter with Lord Beaverbrook,who knows all about this question and has taken part in our many cabinet discussions upon it. You would, I know, find him helpful to you as expressingat first hand the War Cabinefs view.(2)Mr. Eden to Viscount Halifax (Washington).(No. 1961.   Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, March 26, 1942.MY immediately preceding telegram.Stalin&apos;s reply to President and supplementary explanation of Soviet Govern-ment&apos;s views given to me by Soviet Ambassador on their instructions make it clearthat they are unwilling to accept settlement of frontier question outstandingbetween us and them on basis suggested by President in his conversation withM. Litvinov, and that they now await further move from us.2. While we appreciate the Presidents difficulties, this country, as a european Power for whom collaboration with a victorious U.S.S.R. after the warwill be essential, cannot afford to neglect any opportunity of establishing intimaterelations of confidence with Stalin. Fact is that at present time there is no frankdiscussion with Russians at all on major questions concerning conduct of the war.However unreasonably Russians take the attitude that question of Stalin&apos;demand must be cleared out of way before such frank relations can exist. matter has become more urgent now in that we have to make arrangements, in common with United States Government, for renewal of Supplies^ Protocol after itsexpiry in June.3. In a word, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot run the risk of allowingthis question to drag on any longer.   Anglo-Russian relations cannot be left in
suspense at this critical moment in the war. Still less can His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment incur the danger of antagonising the Soviet Government at a moment whenthe closest Allied co-operation in Europe is of such vital and urgent importance.They have reached the conclusion, therefore, that they must in the common interest tell the Soviet Government that they are prepared to negotiate a treatywhereby, among other things, we would recognise the Soviet Governments claims to the 1940 frontiers (other than the Russo-Polish frontier).4. We hope that the President, whatever his views may be with regard tobur policy, will agree that His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken all possible stepsto consult the United States Government before taking action.5. We fully realise that the President will find it difficult, in view of his public opinion, to express approval of the Anglo-Russian treaty which we hopewill result from these negotiations. But even if he cannot approve our proposedline of action we trust that he will at least understand our reasons, will make due allowance for them and will abstain from any overt action which would indicatethat there is any divergence between us.6. Incidentally, you should make it clear, with reference to paragraph 3 ofyour telegram No. 1477, that there is no question of the President being askedto &quot; subscribe &quot; to any treaty, nor has it ever been contemplated that the treaty should be secret.7. We hope that the President will, in judging our action, bear in mind that we, too, have our public opinion to consider. There is no doubt that ifthings go ill with Anglo-Soviet relations we should be bitterly blamed for havingrejected Stalin&apos;s demand, and the position might well become catastrophic ifStalin were to adopt a policy more or less hostile to our interests and were tojustify it publicly on the ground that, owing to the obstinacy and short-sighted-ness of His Majesty&apos;s Government, he had been unable to establish any basis ofco-operation with Great Britain.8. Looked at from the practical point of view the concession which we are called upon to make does not involve us in any onerous commitment.9. I did not fail to observe that the President in his communication toStalin offered at the successful conclusion of the war to support all legitimatemeasures by the Soviet Government to obtain complete future security for the territories of the Union. Similar assurances were offered to Stalin by myselfduring the discussions of last December. The fact that Stalin rejected themthen, as he rejects them now, shows clearly that this matter cannot be dealt withmerely as a security problem. It has a ps3rchological character, which derives from the fact that for twenty years the Soviet Government has not been in relations of equality or confidence with any of the great Western Powers.Stalin&apos;s admittedly discreditable deal with Germany does not affect Russiansclaim in his eyes. Indeed, he has chosen the case of the 1940 frontiers asa criterion of our intentions precisely because we had at the time refused torecognise the Soviet Union&apos;s annexation of the Baltic States as a strategicnecessity, and because he cannot admit either to himself or to the Russian people that the Government with which he is now in alliance still maintains its formaldisapproval of the Soviet Governments action and still declines to acknowledge the Soviet Governments right to recover from the common enemy what theyconsider to be their own territory.10. Meanwhile the Soviet Government is bearing the brunt of the fighting,and Great Britain, apart from supplying war material, is not in a position togive direct assistance bo the Soviet army in the coming German attack in theUkraine. This unfortunate situation at what may be the crisis of the warmakes it all the more necessary that we should not appear any longer to berefusing to make the political concession which the Soviet Government have atthis juncture asked of us.The recognition of the Soviet Governments claim to their 1940 frontierscan, of course, be no substitute for the material help which we should like to beable to give them in the battlefields of Europe, but as a timely gesture in evidenceof our sympathy in the Russian struggle and our confidence in Russian successit may be of inestimable value.
ANNEX II.Draft Agreement between the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain for the Settlement of post-War Questions and for Common Action to ensure Security in Europeafter the Termination of the War with Germany.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of soviet Socialist Republics have concluded the following agreement : article 1.The two Contracting Parties jointly affirm their acceptance of the principlesof the declaration made on the 14th August, 1941, by the President of the UnitedStates and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.The two Contracting Parties undertake that, in the settlement of post-warquestions connected with the organisation of peace and security in Europe, theywill act by mutual agreement.Viscount Halifax to Mr. Eden.(No. 1921.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, April 1, 1942.MY telegram No. 1892 and your telegram No. 2110.1. I saw the Under-Secretary of State this afternoon. He told me that the presidents views remained the same and that they both thought concessions onthis frontier question would only encourage further demands.2.   The President had instructed him to speak as follows : In Stalin&apos;s version of what he wanted (see first sentence of second paragraph of your telegram No. 1989, which I had read to the Under-Secretary of State two days ago), there was nothing safeguarding the Balticpeoples.It would be helpful from the point of view of the Atlantic Charter and united States public opinion if you could get some stipulation inserted,whereby, when Russia was again able to take over these countries, Stalinwould agree that any people who wished to emigrate could be entitled to doso with their property. This should also apply to the parts of Finland and east Poland that might be concerned.If it made it easier to have this arranged on a reciprocal basis, exchangeof populations, there was no objection.3. When the matter was made public the President would have to say thathe had been informed, and he would try to say no more. He could certainlyindicate no approval, and it must be expected that this silence would be construed as disapproval.4. I told the Under-Secretary of State that I would transmit the Presidentssuggestion, but that I anticipated that Stalin would think that acceptance of itwould be destructive of his main case.I think the Under-Secretary of State appreciated this, but repeated that itwould make a tremendous difference here if you could get anything of the sort in.5. He told me that the President had not made any arrangement to see theSoviet Ambassador, but that he was conveying a message to Stalin proposingvisit here by Molotov in order to discuss the projects, military and others, thatthe President might have in mind.6. General atmosphere was sorrowful, but much less resentful than Ihad feared.If and when you get so far, I hope you will do everything you can in anypublication to have regard to the reaction of United States opinion that is much less sympathetic to Russia than I imagine British opinion to be, and as usualis a good deal more emotional.
Article 2.The two Contracting Parties agree that after the termination of hostilitiesthey will take all measures in their power to render impossible a repetition of aggression and violation of the peace by Germany.Article 3.The two Contracting Parties undertake to work for the reconstruction ofEurope after the war with full regard to the interests of both parties in their security as well as to the desire of the U.S.S.R. for the restoration of its frontiersviolated by the Hitlerite aggression, and in accordance with the two principlesnot to seek territorial aggrandisement for themselves and not to interfere in the affairs of European peoples.The objectives of this task of reconstruction will include, in particular : (a) The safeguarding and strengthening of the economic and political independence of all European countries either as unitary orfederated States.(b) The reconstruction of the industrial and economic life of those countries whose territories have been overrun by Germany or her associates.Article 4.The two Contracting Parties agree to render one another all possibleeconomic assistance after the war.The present agreement has been concluded in duplicate in the English and russian languages.Both texts have equal force.By authority of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-   By authority of the Government of theraent in the United Kingdom : Union of Soviet Socialist Republics :ANNEX III.Draft Agreement for Mutual Military Assistance between the U.S.S.R. andGreat Britain in the War against Germany.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Governmentof the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have concluded the followingagreement: Article 1.An Alliance is hereby established between the Soviet Union and GreatBritain and the two allied Powers mutually undertake to afford one anothermilitary assistance and support of all kinds in the war against Germany andthose associated with her acts of aggression in Europe.Article 2.The two Contracting Parties undertake not to enter into negotiations withthe Hitlerite Government or any other Government of Germany that does not clearly renounce all aggressive intentions and not to conclude any armistice orpeace treaty with Germany except by mutual consent.Article 3.Each Contracting Party undertakes not to conclude any alliance and not totake part in any coalition directed against the other Contracting Party.
