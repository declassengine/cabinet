ThilJl gi*meTrt. i3 the property of His Britannic Ma,jestytsiGovernment.OilCopy No. 9jM3 r eje*&apos;r2LZj0t,h&apos; 19426WAR     CABINET,Vichy Squadron at Alexandria.Memorandum &quot;by the First Lord ofthe AdmiraltytWhen Prance collapsed a French Squadron consistingof one battleship^ four cruisers,  two destroyers and onesubmarine under Admiral Godfroy was based at Alexandria underthe supreme command of Admiral Cunningham.    On the 4th July1940 Admiral Godfroy agreed to discharge all the oil fuelfrom his ships and to place them in a condition in which theycould not fight.    On the 7th the Commander-in-Chief reportedthat he had made the agreement for the immobilisation of theFrench Squadron, set out in the Appendix to this paper.Admiral Cunningham states that the agreement is essentially personal one,2,     The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, who isgiving up his Command on the 1st April, now informs us thatthe agreement &quot;being essentially a personal one between himself and the French Admiral, requires to &quot;be re-affirmedby Admiral Godfroy with the new Commander-in-Chief,    he further states that although it might now he preferred to -change certain points in the agreement, the attempt to do so would probably disturb what is a very delicately balancedsituation, and that his intention is to ask Admiral Godfroyto continue the agreement,3,     Under the agreement,  the French Squadron has been rendered almost innocuous.    Parts of all guns, except theA/A guns, have been removed and torpedo war heads placedashore,   Creivs have been reduced to one-third^of their normalcomplement,.,

complementHaving lain nearly two years in a harbournoted fo:,? its marine growths, the speed of the ships musthave been very seriously affected; in any case, they arenly given a weekly ration of fuel sufficient to operate the!in auxiliary engines.The Squadron is therefore, for practical purposes,disarmed and immobilised and although our own Fleet at alexandria is much reduced, I do not think that there is any great danger to be encountered from the Vichy Squadron,50      The alternatives to continuing the present agreement are either to allow the agreement to lapse,  thusfreeing our own and Admiral Godfroy&apos;s hands, or else to seize the ahipso &apos;60      Admiral Godfroy has, in the past, scrupulouslyobserved his undertakings and apart from occasional personneldifficulties ashore, the Squadron has given no real trouble,When we entered Syria and the Mediterranean Fleet was engagingVichy units off the Syrian coast, great anxiety was feltconcerning the Squadron, but Admiral Godfroy&apos;s. conductthroughout the incident was immaculate,    it therefore appearsthat the confidence reposed by Admiral Cunningham in the personalundertakings of Admiral Godfroy is justified,7,     The seizure of the French ships was seriously considered at the time of the Syrian operations and againlater for the purpose of &quot;replacing our own cruiser losses.The Commander-in-Chief has long had detailed plans for the seizure of the ships but has always been opposed to this step,not only because it would be a breach of faith, but onpractical grounds.    The French are believed to have preparedscuttling charges which could be fired merely by pressing abutton, so tihnt it is very unlikely that we should obtainpossession of the shipsintact.   Admiral Cunningham has saidcategorically that we should get no assistance from sympathiserson the ships.s

8,     Even if we were successful in capturing the shipsintact, it would he a long time before they bould be of any use to us.    They would have to be docked and would requireconsiderable refitting before they could be employed on active service.   Furthermore, they have only one outfit ofammunition and special arrangements would have to be madein U.K. to produce a further supply,    The political repercussions at Vichy and Toulon of forcible action againstthe Squadron need no emphasis.   Admiral Cunningham hashimself expressed greater apprehension at the possibilityof trouble with the main French Fleet than with the Squadronat Alexandria. .S0     The Admiralty therefore consider that sb.*-4Lo.hg asAdmiral Godfroy remains in command of the Squadron, it is. toour interest to continue the present arrangements.    Theagreement contains provisions, for its termination in theevent of French warships being taken over by the enemy orof war breaking out with Prance,10.     Accordingly, the Admiralty propose that AdmiralCunningham should.be authorised to request Admiral Godfroyto re-affirm the agreement with the new Commander-in-Chief.A. V.
