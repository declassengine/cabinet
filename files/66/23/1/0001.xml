BRIDGES.Secretary to the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W.1.13TH MARCH, 1942.SECURITY OP RADIO TELEPHONE.Memorandum by the Chairman of the wireless telegraphy Board.The Wireless Telegraphy Board is seriously disturbed by the increasing use of R/T for all purposes.The security of the various devices used for disguisingradio telephony transmissions has been&apos;discussed at theBoard with wireless engineers from the General PostOffice.      The Board is of the opinion that no securitydevice has yet been produced which gives any realsecurity to radio telephony transmissions.      Securitydevices (e.g.  scrambling)  are only of avail against thecasual eavesdropper, and afford no secrecy whatsoever whentapped by a fully qualified radio engineer with ampleresources.As far, therefore,  as the enemy are concerned, all-radio telephony trur^uissionR should be looked on as having no more secrecy than if they were in ordinary speech,    andwe can be tolerably certain that they are all overheard bythe enemy, who, we know, watch our v/ireless traffic.It is requested, therefore, that this opinion maybe brought to the notice of the War Cabinet, and that suitabllfinstructions may oe drawn up to ensure that nothing of value to the enemy is ever transmitted over the radiotelephone.(Signed)    C.V.L.
