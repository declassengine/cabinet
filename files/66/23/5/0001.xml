I am asked to agree that any who happen to be selected to servewith Indian troops shall receive the same favourable treatment when servingoutside India.The question is whether it is right at a time when men in this country are called upon to give up their civil occupation and perform military service inthe ranks, that those who are fortunate enough to be given commissions should,if they are selected to serve with Indian troops, receive outside India consider-ably better financial terms than their fellows serving with British troops in thesame area.  I cannot think that it is.The absolute advantage enjoyed by officers serving on Indian emolumentsis enhanced by the fact that the Indian rate of income tax (now to be levied bothin and out of India) is less than the British rate, though a larger proportionof Indian emoluments are taxable than is the case with British emoluments. Atpresent the differences in net emoluments are (for example)  8 a month forCaptains and  35 for a Lieutenant-Colonel.These differences are not insignificant and, though there may be some increase of Indian income tax in the forthcoming budget, they are not likelyto be affected very materially.I had proposed that the matter should be remitted to the Lord president to act as conciliator, but the Secretary of State for India feels that the questionis of such importance that it must be settled by the War Cabinet.P. J- G.The War Office,14th March, 1942.
PAY OF BRITISH SERVICE OFFICERS WITH INDIAN UNITS ANDFORMATIONSi. The question relates to the rates of pay which should be paid to officersof the British Service serving with Indian units or formations outside India.2. Indian Army rates which are drawn both by Indian Army officers andBritish Service officers in India attached to Indian Army units are morefavourable in themselves than the British rates admissible under the PayWarrant and Army Allowance Regulations, and the effect of these differencesis accentuated by the fact that Indian taxation is lighter than British taxation.It is possible that the forthcoming Indian budget may increase the rates oftaxation, but such an increase is unlikely to remove disparities of emolumentsin ranks above Lieutenant which, in the War Office view, cannot be justified,even accepting (and it must not be taken that this is accepted, especially inwar time) that officers are entitled to higher pay if operating with Indian troops.Higher pay is not given generally to British officers operating with other troops from, e.g., East or West Africa in war time.3. British Army officers in British units in India draw slightly less favour-able rates than Indian Army officers and British Service officers attached to indian Army units, in that they do not receive what is known as the &quot; indian army allowance &quot;. But even so such officers, in both units and formations,draw (in ranks higher than that of Lieutenant) appreciably higher emolumentsthan British Service officers in British units and formations serving outsideIndia, and when their units and formations move outside India they drop tothe appropriate British rates and pay British and not the lower Indian incometax.4. The view of the Army Council is that in principle British Service officersserving with Indian Army units or in Indian formations outside India shouldbe treated exactly the same as any other British Service officers serving in thesame theatre. Otherwise there is the anomaly of two British officers of the samerank and roughly the same history both starting from this country but drawingvery different rates of net pay merely because one serves with an Indian unitor formation and the other with a British.5. Shortly after the outbreak of war it was agreed in principle, and instruc-tions were sent to India in connection with certain forces then being sent outof India to Egypt and Malaya, that all categories of British Service officersserving outside India should receive British rates with the exception of:  (1) Staff Officers who before leaving India were serving for a definitetenure and continued to hold the same appointment outside India, and(2) officers who were serving with Sappers and Miners, Mountain artillery and Indian Signals.These categories already serving in Indian appointments or units were accepted by the. War Office as having vested rights to Indian rates. unfortunate-nately the intention of this decision was not understood in the same sense bythe War Office, the India Office and the Government of India, and a lengthycorrespondence and exchange of telegrams ensued in the course of which furthermisunderstandings arose resulting in considerable extensions of the vested rightcategories. The Army Council, while recognizing the difficulty created by thesevested rights, have pressed that the principle of British rates and British tax, out of India should be accepted for all future attachments to Indian units orappointments to Indian formations so that at any rate the number of speciallyprivileged officers and instances of glaring disparity should not be increased.As things stand there are such instances as that a Major with an Indian unit inthe Middle East may be receiving more in net emoluments than the Lieutenant-Colonel of a British unit; a Brigade Major in an Indian formation more thana Brigadier in a British, and a Lieutenant-Colonel commanding an Indian unit
more than a Major-General commanding a British Division. It must also beremembered that under the Indian expenditure plan the cost in effect falls on theBritish Taxpayer.6. There have been complaints from officers of British units that on leaving India they are much worse off than officers with Indian Army units,but clearly they have no more ground for complaint than British officers sentto the same theatre from this country or elsewhere.7. The view of the Government of India is that the anomalies of. the presentsituation should be solved by the simple expedient of allowing Indian rates toall officers who happen to be serving with Indian units and formations andignoring the differences between their net emoluments and those of british officers with British units and formations. Mixed formations would be classifiedfor this purpose either as British or Indian, and a British formation might be changed to Indian as dilution increases, altering the rates of the commander and staff to Indian, but leaving the British units on British rates.8. A recent complication which makes the need for a decision of particularurgency is that whereas British Service officers required for the Indian expansion programme up to now have been attached without change of status and (apartfrom those with vested rights) could be brought on to British rates outsideIndia there is now a proposal to transfer instead of attaching some 4,000 officers who would thereby acquire the privilege of Indian rates throughout their service.The War Office has taken the view that these officers should not be transferred,but should remain in the British Service and be attached, and that to avoid further discrimination between these and other British candidates for service with the Indian Army the Indian Army should also cease to take furthercandidates direct from this country for appointment through O.C.T.Us.in India or by appointing British other ranks to Indian Army commissions,meeting all their requirements By&quot; attachment. It is felt strongly that in wartime British officers, most of whom are serving on temporary emergencycommissions and would otherwise be liable to compulsory service in the ranks,should be sent to serve wherever required in the public interest on British ratesof pay, and that special financial privileges outside India should not be givento some of them merely because they serve with Indian units.9. The Secretary of State for India, it is understood, does not go so far asthe Government of India. He has intimated that he personally would be readyto go a great way to meeting the War Office case in other respects provided theWar Office would be willing not merely to allow but to help the India Office tothe best of the War Office ability to obtain volunteers for employment as IndianService Officers on Indian Sen/ice terms in those branches of the Service whichare not normally manned by British Service officers. It is clear from what issaid above that this does not by any means meet the War Office point of view,and in any case the Secretary of State for India feels that he must carry theViceroy and the Indian Military authorities with him in any concessions hemakes to the War Office point of view.10. As matters stand fresh vested rights continue to be created, increasingthe anomalies between one British officer and another and sowing the seeds of serious discontent, and officers who are required for service with Indian units are in a state of great uncertainty as to their position. It is, therefore, imperativefrom the War Office point of view that the question of principle should besettled without further delay.II. A separate but smaller question raising similar considerations arises inconnection with the.rates.-of Indian Army officers in British Staff appointments.The rule hitherto has been that an officer in this category should receive british staff rates or the Indian Regimental rates of his substantive rank whichever arethe more favourable. The Government of India asks that in all cases in whichit is accepted as desirable that the Indian Army officer should hold such an appointment because of his special Indian experience, he should be paid atIndian Staff rates.
12. It is represented that the present rules prevent the best use of officers,as Indian Army officers are unwilling to serve in British Staff posts or posts in mixed formations to which British rates are applicable unless they are giventhe financial benefits of Indian Staff rates.13. The War Office view is that there are no real grounds for paying an indian Army officer in a British Staff appointment more than a British Serviceofficer would receive in the same appointment except in so far as the indian army officer has a vested right to Indian Regimental rates if more favourable.(b41/66)   So   3/42   w.o.p.   10362
