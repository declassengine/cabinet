The demands of productive industry for additional       \ \ ifmanpower have focussod -attention on the question at the     (a^ak/^present stage of the war of maintaining large numbers of     \ j\ Iwhole-time personnel in the civil defence services io *fjl^,standing-by night and day,  and,  in view of the need to /   &apos;concentrate our efforts on offensive rather than defensive measures,  the possibilities&apos;of reductions in whole-timepersonnel have been under inter-departmental examination,2.      According to the latest figures available the followingnumbers of men and women are at present employed on awhole-time basis  in the National Fire Service and theLocal Authority Civil Defence General Services.National, Fire Service --England &amp; WalesScotlandMen101,0357, 145Women19,707671Tot a120,7427,816Local Authority civil defence General Services.118,07650,277168,553296,9113.      It is generally agreed that there is need to replacedefensive thinking by an offensive will to victory.    In its application to civil defence this changed outlook involves the acceptance by the civil population of a reduced degree&apos;of cover in passive defence.    Complete immunity from danger is not in any circumstances obtainable  and it becomes aquestion what amount of the present scale of preparation may properly be sacrificed in order to transfer into war-productive industry considerable numbers.of those nowimmobilised in civil defence.4.      I believe it is possible to make a valuable contributionto industry by releasing from the civil defence services an appreciable number of whole-time personnel and at the  sametime to maintain trained services of sufficient strength,including many more part-time personnel   than have hitherto been employed.    The Minister of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland share my view and associate themselves for the services for which they are respectively responsible,with the policy here set out.    The releases of men andwomen under these proposals will be  governed by the rate at which the Minister of Labour and National Service canarrange their absorption into industry and I  shall have his assistance both in the recall of released personnel where necessary and in directing persons to perform part-time service in civil defence,    In the event of raiding beingresumed on its former scale the services would.be restored to strength by the exercise of existing powers to recall the

greater part of those who have been conditionallyreleased to war industry.    Moreover it is proposed toamend Defence Regulation 29(B) to make it a further conditionof release that men and women retain their connection with civil defence by performing part-time service as required.N a t i o n a 1 F i r e S e r v i c e.5.      The scope for reduction is less in the National PireService than in the Local Authority Civil Defence GeneralServices.    The National Pire Service has not been recruitedup to the numbers authorised in November last.    Even whenthe numbers already allocated have been posted there will still be a shortage of 5,000 men on the numbers then fixed.Economies in the National Pire Service would, therefore,  takethe form of not recruiting to the full extent authorised,releasing men with special qualifications to industry,  andnot replacing wastage.    The precise size of the cut and theperiod during which it will be effected cannot yet be stated&apos; but,  so far as England and Wales are concerned,  I have it inI mind that the present strength of the Service would bereduced by about one-sixth.    The Secretary of State forScotland does not consider that,  having regard to the seriousexisting shortage of personnel,  recruitment to the full-timemale strength of the National Pire Service in Scotland canbe suspended immediately but he proposes to reduce themaximum number of full-time men in the Service from thetotal of about 11,000 proposed in November last to a totalnot exceeding 8,000.Local Authority Civil Defence (General) Services.6.      In.the Local Authority General Services,   in which speedin dealing with incidents,  though important,  is not so muchof the essence as in the Fire Service and part-timepersonnel not actually on duty at the depots at the timeof the &quot;alert&quot; would often be available in sufficient time,a larger &quot;proportionate reduction of personnel should be tpossible.    A general scheme of reorganisation is taking&apos;place, as a result.of which I feel that, without undue risk,a reduction of personnel up to one third of whole-timestrength within the next month of six weeks is justifiable.7.      Reductions on this scale will only be justified on theassumption that the Ministry of Labour and National service can direct considerable numbers of men and women to fillresultant vacancies on a part-time basis.    As the maximum period of unpaid part-time civil defence service which canbe required of any man or woman is 48 hours per month thenumbers to be provided;,  if every vacancy has to be filled,might amount to six times as. many as are to be released.On the other hand,  I hope that the reorganisation of thegeneral services, which includes reducing the degree of- specialisation,- improving the direction and control, and increasing the radius if action of the mobile service, willmake it unnecessary to replace by part-time volunteersevery whole-time civil defence worker who is released to industry.8.      I have reason to believe that local authorities will bebetter prepared to accept the reduction in the civil   . .defence services if the Government will announce theirassumption of full responsibility for the policy.    Perhaps inLondon Region objections will be louder than elsewhere,

for releases contemplated from that Region total nearly .20,000 and are on a larger scale than from any other Region.9.      The release of so considerable&apos;a proportion of the-whole-time civil defence workers in the more populous areasinvolves the acceptance of a certain risk if raiding on alarge scale  is resumed but in view of the Air Staff1sforecast the risk is one which I think we ought to take inpresent circumstances.    The latest appreciation of the AirStaff suggests that the preoccupation of the German Air force on the Russion Front would prevent any speedy resumption ofraiding on the  scale&apos; experienced a year ago and that, evenif the&apos; Russion Front-were to collapse,   it would take six weeks fully to reorganise the German Air Force for heavy scale-raids on this country.    In the  interval much can be done to train the new part-time entrants and many of the releasedpersonnel, who are fully trained,  can be called back ifexisting strength proves insufficient.10,      I need not trouble my colleagues - with proposals,which also form a part of the scheime,  involving the provisionof alternative work for members of the civil defence serviceswho cannot be released;Police.11.      The possibility of applying to the Police Service thepolicy outlined above has also been examined.    There is not much scope for the release of whole-time personnel, since   -the peacetime strength of the force has been increased only from some 62,000 to some 90,000 in England and Wales andfrom 6,800 to 9,500 in Scotland,  and the present whole-timestrength cannot be regarded as excessive in view of theadditional burdens and responsibilities which fall on thepolice in wartime.    Nevertheless,  I think- that the police service also should make its contribution to the solution ofthe manpower problem.    I suggest,  with the concurrence ofthe Secretary of State for Scotland,  therefore,  that theregular police Who were under 25 at the time of registration in 1940 (estimated at some 6,000 in England and Wales and about 1,000 in Scotland)  should be released to the armed forces, unless there are  good reasons why individuals within this age group should be retained.    The release ofpolicemen of this age group will result in some impairmentof the efficiency of the Police Service in case of heavy air raids or in invasion, but the risk is one which in presentcircumstances I think we are  justified in taking,  havingregard to the valuable material which would be released tothe fighting services,12.      I ask for Cabinet sanction to release on the scale proposed,  viz.  up to one-sixth of the National Fire service in England and Wales,  one-third of the General Civil defence services and some 7,000 young policemen.h.m..HOME OFFICE.IOth April.  194
