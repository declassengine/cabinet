The Raw Materials Assignment Board, under Mr. Batt, is also in opera-tion in Washington.The arrangements for instructing and supplying information to our representative on this Board are working smoothly. In order that theEmpire situation may be fully presented, an Empire Clearing-house has been set up in London to centralise the requirements and statistics of theDominions, India and the Colonial Empire.3. The Washington Agreement provided for combined* action regardingfinished munitions, raw materials and shipping; but it did not make any proposalfor preparing a combined or co-ordinated production plan.This is a serious gap, for production programmes must now be reconsidered.In our own case, this review must take account of three sets of facts :  (a) When our present plans reach their peak, there will be no appreciablemargin for further expansion. Fresh requirements must therefore bemet by substitution and not by gross increase of programme.(b) The change in the military situation must cause some radical shifts inthe balance of our war production.(c) In order to avoid waste of effort, our production programmes mustdovetail into American plans much more closely than before.It is therefore proposed that:-- __,A Joint War Production Staff t should be set up :/(i) to study and advise the Minister of Production on adjustments or extensions of our war production programmes in the light of the strategical needs of the united nations and the production programmes of Empire and Allied countries:(ii) to keep the Chiefs of Staff informed on the production situation andpossibilities; (iii) to supply the information required by the british representatives on the combined bodies set up under the Washington* Anglo-American. f Military and Civil.[23601]
