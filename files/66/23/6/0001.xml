These resources cover many of Germany&apos;s deficiencies; Germany couldsupply many of Japan&apos;s needs. Each would be greatly strengthened if it could make contact with the other.   Both are planning to do so and expect to succeed..   (2) Vichy France assumes greater importance (a) because Metropolitan France and Vichy Colonial possessions french north and West Africa and Madagascar- form a link between thetwo enemy worlds; -(b) because the strain on the Allied Navies enhances the danger of any hostile action by the French fleet.(3) The German military threat to all adjacent neutrals (excepting perhapsSweden and Turkey) is much reduced by the Russian campaign. The relativeinfluence of the two belligerent sides over these neutrals has not yet greatlychanged, but. it has become unstable and may vary greatly and suddenly in eitherdirection with the course of the war in 1942.(4) So much of the world&apos;s resources and shipping has now passed underthe control of the belligerents that the remaining neutrals find themselvesincreasingly dependent on one side or the other and are correspondinglysusceptible to&apos; economic pressure. The belligerents, however, as their needs grow,their debts rise and their exports fall, become more reluctant to supply the march 21, 1942.ALLIED ECONOMIC WARFARE STRATEGY IN 1942.Summary.[23591]b
neutrals with their essential needs, even in exchange for valuable supplies, whilst the neutrals become less willing to part with their products on any other terms.The possibility of denying to the enemy the resources from European neutralswhich he increasingly requires will depend largely upon the Allies&apos; ability tosupply at least small quantities of the commodities which the neutrals most need to maintain their internal economy.(5) The occupied countries have become more important to German economy and a greater potential source of danger to it.(6) Germany has been forced to concentrate all her resources of men and materials on preparing for this year&apos;s campaigns with greater intensity than ever before; her economy has thereby become more inelastic and vulnerable.(7) The Allies have built up a large air force which is available forattacking enemy shipping and other economic objectives.(8) The Allies are themselves subject to economic war on a scale farexceeding anything which they have experienced hitherto. The Americas and africa may become the Allies&apos; only trans-oceanic sources of supply.Conclusions.The principal objects of Allied economic warfare strategy during 1942should be (1) To prevent the two enemy dominions from establishing economicexchange by blockade running; still more, of course, to prevent their openingregular communications by land or sea.(2) To develop the increased possibilities of economic pressure on the neutralborder States adjacent to German Europe and on Vichy French colonies to thefullest extent which the military situation permits, with a view both&apos;to obtaining supplies and to denying to the enemy resources which are becoming more than ever essential to him.(3) To develop within occupied countries both in German Europe and inthe Far East all forms of passive and active resistance to economic exploitation.(4) To develop methods for directing against the increasing weakness ofGermany&apos;s war potential attack from the air which shall really be effective.(5) To devise combined operations against the most important accessibleeconomic targets in enemy-occupied territory and against his lines ofcommunication.(6) To defend important sources of supply and access to them, including thesupplies of South America.ALLIED ECONOMIC WARFARE STRATEGY IN 1942.1. The conditions of economic warfare have abruptly changed. Theblockade has become more difficult. The counter-blockade has become vastly moreformidable. At the same time the scope and possibilities of our economic offensivehave widened and the relative&apos; importance of its weapons has altered. Theprincipal changes are analysed below : I.-The Threat to the Blockade..2. During the first stage of the war-up to the collapse of France -the denial of supplies to the enemy was effected by the interception and examinationat British or French bases of vessels bound for the countries bordering on germany. War Trade Agreements and Shipping Agreements were negotiatedand helped the blockade but, in effect, it was exercised by, and depended on,the Navy.3. In the eighteen- months following the fall of France, although theultimate deterrent to blockade-runners was still the&apos; British Navy, hew methods for denying Overseas supplies to Germany were developed.   By the end of 1941,
these methods (compulsory navicerts, ships&apos; warrants and their attendantmachinery) were adequate, with very little naval assistance, to deny to Germanypractically all ocean-borne supplies, except those carried in enemy or Vichyblockade-runners, or in Vichy ships in convoy.4. Enemy blockade-running: of which there was a recrudescence in the summer of 1941, had been practically stopped by naval action, and theimmobilisation of enemy ships in American ports had greatly reduced the fearof its resumption. The overseas blockade was thus virtually complete exceptfor French Colonial produce reaching enemy territory from French North and west Africa in Vichy ships. Naval action against Vichy ships had also stopped,at least temporarily, French convoys from the Far East and Madagascar.5. The entry into the war of Japan and her subsequent conquests have created a new enemy area of great size and economic wealth, and have placed atthe disposal of Japan supplies of raw materials sufficient to make good most ofher own long-term deficiencies and also many of the principal existing deficienciesof Germany. At the same time it has greatly increased the Japanese need for anumber of manufactured and semi-manufactured products obtainable from europe.6. Thus, the principal problem of blockade, which has hitherto been the denial of neutral resources to one enemy, has become in 1942 the denial to twoenemies of access to the products of each other&apos;s dominions. This can only bedone by the fighting services. So once again a major part of the blockade will depend directly on naval interception, assisted probably more than in the earlierperiod by air reconnaissance and attack.7. Contact between the two enemy worlds might be established by fourpossible routes across Russia; by Suez or the Persian Gulf; round the Cape ofGood Hope; and round Cape Horn. The first is denied by Russian arms; thesecond by the British hold on the Middle East. The third and fourth are alreadypossible, although precarious, to blockade-runners. The Cape Horn route involves a 17,000 mile passage without refuelling; since the Japanese war began twoblockade-runners have so far (13th March, 1942) attempted the inward passage,one successfully, whilst another is believed to be loading for an outward voyage.The route via the Cape of Good Hope involves a voyage of 11,000 miles (reckonedfrom Singapore) on which the only possible refuelling station is at presentMadagascar. No enemy or Vichy ships, so far as is known, have used this routesince Japan entered the war. There are a number of ships capable of makingeither voyage without refuelling. French West Africa, French North Africa andthe Atlantic coast of Metropolitan France provide alternative terminal portsmore or less under Axis control, whilst the Atlantic ports of Northern Spaincan also be used for transhipment without serious danger.8. The prospects of successful and frequent blockade running by the Hornor by the Cape would, of course, be increased, if British and American naval forces were denied bases appropriate for interception. Hence the importance, on theone hand, of British and American bases and facilities on and off the AtlanticCoast of South America; on the other, of the ports of South Africa. The SouthAfrican ports are even more important as safeguarding the supply routes linkingBritain and the United States with Australia, Egypt and the Middle East. these routes, however, must be held from both ends. Practically all the supplies for theAllied front which stretches from Libya to Afghanistan enter through tworelatively narrow inlets-the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf-and almost all the oil on which that front, India and East Africa, depend, comes out through thelatter channel. Reverses which cUt communications between Egypt and the Cape,or Egypt and the Persian Gulf, by endangering our position in the Middle East!would give the enemy the hope of opening the direct route from the mediterranean to the Far East. &apos; &apos;9. A few blockade-runners (say a dozen cargoes) would relieve Germany&apos;sessential needs for 1942 in rubber, wolfram, tin, hemp and wool if wool became available to Japan and might take back to Japan ball bearings, precisioninstruments and machine tools sufficient to be of real assistance in the expansionof her industry.[23591] B 2
II. The Increased Significance of Vichy.10. Metropolitan France and Vichy colonial possessions French North and west Africa and Madagascar acquire greater significance as a link between two enemy worlds. The appearance of Japan as a combatant and her earlysuccesses--have increased the importance of that enigmatic factor, the french fleet.III. The Counter Blockade.11. Japanese successes have already denied to the Allies important suppliesof rubber, tin, wolfram, chrome, oil and food, and, if they continue, may leave the americas and Africa as the Allies&apos; only trans-oceanic sources of supply. Allthe Allies now face economic war of the same kind and scale as that which theyhave waged against Germany hitherto. The enemy, in particular the Japanese,are known to be fully conscious of the possibilities of economic war and essential supplies are likely to be objectives for special attack. Even the vital supplies ofSouth America, which is still relatively remote from the battle, are not immune from attack from within, by methods ranging from obstruction and sabotage toarmed revolt by the large and well-organised enemy minorities in these countries.The protection of these supplies and of access to them, as well as of the routes bywhich they move, has thus become a matter of high importance and perhaps ofconsiderable urgency.IV. The Russian Campaign.12. The neutral countries bordering on German Europe have from thebeginning of the war constituted an economic &quot; No Man&apos;s Land,&quot; whose resourceshave been in part denied to the enemy by war-trade agreements and pre-emptionand indirectly by rationing. There are now only five such countries Sweden,Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and Turkey. The dominant factor governing theirattitude has been the menace of German military power. In March 1942,although the threat remains, it is distinctly less. Weakened and preoccupied bythe Russian campaign, Germany will not willingly extend the area of heroccupation, especially against resistance, in any direction which does notcontribute directly to the task of defeating Russia. An occupation of the peninsula, Switzerland, Unoccupied France, French North or West Africa, or perhaps even Sweden or Turkey, is therefore less probable than heretofore.13. This change does not appear as yet to have affected the enemy&apos;s influence over these countries, except possibly Spain; for Britain, though entering on 1942with new allies and with armed forces strengthened in men and material, has lost prestige through her defeats in Libya and the Far East; and she and her allies have had to divide their forces to meet a new enemy. The relative influence of the two sides has therefore not yet greatly changed; but it has become unstableand may vary greatly and suddenly in either direction with the course of the warin 1942. The Allies must be ready to take advantage of any variation in their favour.V. The Economic Dependence of the Neutrals.14. Hitherto, for a number of their most important requirements, thecountries in &quot; No Man&apos;s Land &quot; have sought from Britain only navicerts, that isto say, the right to import-?a facility which wehave hesitated to refuse at dis-cretion. Now, however, the vastly increased supply programmes of the Allies andtheir claims on the diminishing pool of available merchant shipping, are making-it impossible for neutrals to obtain their requirements except through positive action, and sacrifice by the Allies. Spain and Portugal, for example, can atpresent hope for adequate oil supplies only by the goodwill of the United StatesGovernment, which, in order to ensure adequate supplies for the Allies, is taking steps to control the distribution of oil produced in the American continent. the neutrals, in fact, are bound to become ever more dependent on one or other of the belligerent groups.   There is thus an opportunity to substitute for the negative
conception of economic warfare which has hitherto prevailed a positive policyunder Which the economic power of the Allies would be used to extort from the border States economic advantages in return for guarantees of essential supplies.By this means we may hope both to deny neutral European resources to the enemy and to secure them for the Allies and at the same time to put an end to theabsurd situation, so common hitherto, in which the Allies buy from a neutral atfantastically inflated prices, whilst supplying its needs at the prices ruling in thefree world.15. These possibilities are of particular significance at a time when Japan&apos;sconquests have deprived the Allies of valuable sources of supplies, and thus madethe resources of the European neutrals far more important to us, whilst the wastage of the Russian campaign has made them hO less important to Germany.VI. More Scope for Attack.(i) Night Bombing.16. Until relatively recently, the only weapon for attacking the enemy&apos;economy behind his frontier was the night bomber. This new weapon has not yetplayed a decisive part in economic war, partly because of the limited size of our bomber force, partly because the science of using it has not yet been mastered. Itis understood that in 1942 a greater force will be available. This will constitute an important new factor in the economic war if, but only if, it can be so appliedas to yield the results expected of it.(ii) Attacks on Shipping.17. Sea transport has become of increased importance to Germany. to japan it is vital; her capacity to continue the war beyond 1942 will depend uponextended lines of sea communication. Enemy shipping has thus become an evenmore important target than hitherto for attack by sea and air.(iii) Other Forms of Attack.18. In recent months, for the first time, attaeks upon economic targets behindGerman Europe&apos;s frontier have been successfully carried out by daylight raidingfrom the air and by combined operations from the sea. Many highly importanttargets invite attention as the possibilities for such attacks grow greater.(iv) Resistance in Occupied Territories.19. The growth of organised resistance throughout the occupied countries of Europe provides a further weapon of immense potentiality which ha&apos;s only recently begun to make itself felt. Germany grows more dependent on the occupied countries, and in particular on their man-power, whether working in their countries or in Germany. The countries at present occupied by Germany are morethan six times the area of Greater Germany, and contain a population two-and-a-half times as great. The extent to Which this vast commitment can be made a burden may decisively affect the war. The opportunities for political warfare and for all forms of subversion and sabotage are greater than ever before.VII. Changes in Germany&apos;s Economy.(i) Over-Mobilisation.20. Having developed her resources in order to defeat Russia in 1941,Germany is having to prepare for another campaign in 1942 against the sameenemy without having any winter respite for refitting. In order to achieve this sheis concentrating both men and material on her immediate war needs at the cost of cutting all her other economic activities to and beyond the danger-point. Thisrenders her economy more inelastic- than at any previous time.(ii) Dependence on Occupied Countries:21. Germany can only relieve the present situation by the further exploita-tion of the occupied countries. She already employs within Greater Germanynearly 4 million immigrant civilian workers and prisoners of war (more than
10 per cent, of her total labour force), and there is evidence of her intentiongreatly to increase her intake of forced labour from the occupied countries. Shealso relies on these countries for raw materials, for agricultural surpluses andfor industrial production. She must maintain in these countries the forcesnecessary for occupation, security and administration as well as for defence;these demands grow and will grow. The extent to which she can extort by force adividend commensurate with the effort involved is limited.(iii) Raw Material Shortages.22. Her task is complicated by the growth of raw material shortages, notablyoil, rubber, leather, textiles and some metals. These shortages limit the use which she can make of the vassal countries. All these shortages are growing greater.All are affecting the armed forces, or will shortly do so, except in so far as thesituation may be relieved by blockade running from the Far East.(iv) Germany^ Task for 1942.23. Germany&apos;s war potential was mobilised to secure the maximum military effort during the latter part of 1941, and is already out of balance. Her only hope of redressing the balance is to defeat the Russians decisively and establishcommunication with the Far East, or else (an inadequate substitute) to set the occupied countries to work for her with a success far beyond anything whichat present seems likely.&apos; She will, of course, try to do both, but during 1942,unless and until she has decisively defeated Russia, Germany&apos;s economicsituation is likely to be inelastic and vulnerable to a much greater extent than ever before.VIII. The Entry of Japan.24. Japan&apos;s position differs from that of Germany in almost every respect.Her conquests have already secured to her all the raw materials she needs exceptlead (which is available in Burma and Australia), wool (which is available inAustralia, Chile, Peru and Argentina), cotton (which is available in India, Peruand Brazil) and copper (which is available in Chile and Peru). Her weaknessesare on the industrial side. Her iron and steel industry is far smaller by corn-par ison with her population; her reserves of technical skill and experience are less. Whereas German Europe is full of factories without raw material andmarkets without supplies, Japan&apos;s new dominions are full of raw materialwithout factories and supplies without markets. The problem of &quot;surpluses&quot;in these areas has been made much worse, and the odium of failing to solve it will fall upon Japan.25. Japan&apos;s chief needs from Europe are machinery, machine tools,precision instruments and technical advice. She can expect little contribution in industrial output from her conquests (other than the production of raw materials)and must expand her industry at home. Her homeland, though probably more vulnerable than Germany to aerial attack, is far less accessible except to anattack by Russia; and her dominions are linked to it, not as Germany&apos;s, by anoverburdened, though efficient, system of rail and river transport, but by very long sea routes along which a chain of islands offers unique opportunities for protection by shore-based aircraft.26. Japan entered the war with substantial stocks of her many deficiencies,probably on^the average about a year&apos;s supply. Her four-fold task for 1942 isto complete and consolidate her conquests, to damage the Allies as much aspossible, to develop her captured resources before her stocks are exhausted andat. the same time to maintain and develop her armament production. This taskwill make great demands on her capacity to produce plant and machinery on alarge scale and to develop and transport from the areas which she has overrunsuch of their products as she needs.
