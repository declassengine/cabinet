A.-FREE FRENCH.(i) Navy.Changes in the Higher Command.The long-existing friction between General cle Gaulle and Admiral Muselierculminated recently in the resignation of the latter from the Comite national and subsequently in his suspension as Commander-in-Chief. The General haspromoted Captain Auboyneau to Rear-Admiral and appointed him Commander-in-Chief. Captain Gayral acts for Auboyneau until the latter returns from the pacific. Captain Moret has been relieved as Chief of Staff by CommanderJaequet.2. On Admiral Muselier&apos;s supersession some forty officers sent him lettersof resignation, but he did not accept these or pass them on to de Gaulle. Aboutsixteen officers of the Staff actually resigned, but, mainly on British advice, all except three or four withdrew their resignations and have been reinstated. Sofar as can be ascertained, there have been no serious manifestations on the partof the men. Considering that a large proportion of the officers and men have a feeling of affection for the Admiral, and are aware of the difficulties put in his way by the General, it may be considered somewhat surprising that the free french Navy has not been more disturbed than it has been. This is due mainly to the following factors : (a) The elementary sense of duty which, whatever the rights or wrongs ofthe case, make resignation or refusal of duty repugnant in war.(&amp;) Fear of the consequences, whether disciplinary or economic, due todismissal.(c) Pride on the part of the personnel in their little navy and determinationnot to do anything that might do it serious harm.3. The latter factor is probably the one that has had most influence on themen, and, indeed, on many of the officers. Had the present events happened somemonths ago, this incentive to remain passive would probably not have existed. Itis only comparatively recently that the Free French Navy has, as a whole, takenitself seriously. It has taken time for them to have confidence in themselves or inus, but now that they see that, despite many difficulties (and there have beenmany, particularly, the paucity of Officers and Petty Officers of the regular Navy)their Navy has become a live organisation capable of useful work with successesto its credit, they have taken heart and are proud of the force they have helped to build up.4. Be this as it may, the disturbances at the top cannot be healthy for anyService, especially one composed of such temperamental people as the French, andof whom so many are politically minded. It will, therefore, be necessary to keep a very close watch on the situation for some time to come.5. The reports received from Senior Naval Officers who have had free french ships under their commands during the past quarter have, on the whole,been favourable. Discipline and efficiency have tended to improve, and aboutsome ships it has been said that they are comparable to British ships in carryingout their duties.Losses.6. The Free French Navy have lost, during the quarter, the corvetteA lysse, torpedoed while on convoy escort in the North Atlantic, and the submarineSurcouf, rammed during the night by a merchant ship in the Caribbean. Halfthe crew of the A lysse were saved, but there were no survivors from the crew of135 in the submarine.Successes and A attacks on Enemy Submarines.7. Rubis. This submarine has carried out several minelaying trips in enemy waters and is considered to be most efficient. Her captain and&quot; firstlieutenant have both been awarded bars to their D.S.C&apos;s. Four D.S.M&apos;s havebeen given and six mentions in despatches.&quot; [23709] B 2
8. The corvette Roselys rammed a submarine in the North Atlantic. Shesustained damage to her keel and must, therefore, have at least damaged thesubmarine.9. . The corvette A conit sighted a submarine on the surface and attacked with depth charges, but no result could be claimed.Ships Commissioned or to Commission shortly.10.   The corvette Commandant Drogov, was commissioned in January.11. The Admiralty have allocated the corvette Phlox to the Free french in replacement of the Alysse. The name Commandant d&apos;Estienne d&apos;Orves hasbeen suggested for her, and it is hoped she will commission in April. TheAdmiralty have also agreed to turn over two more corvettes as soon as crews areavailable.12. The manning of the second four M.L&apos;s by the French, which it had been hoped would take place in February, has been postponed and they are now expected to be available in May.13. The refit and rearming of the destroyer Leopard, which has lasted foreleven months, is now expected to be finished in a few weeks&apos; time.Ships Paid Off.14. The three V.T,B&apos;s which had been operating from Cowes have been paid off and placed in reserve on account of their unsuitability for the work required of them.Movements of Ships.15. The corvettes Commandant Detroyat and Commandant Drogou have joined the South Atlantic Command for convoy escort duties.16. The sloop Savorgnan de Brazza, which had been based on Aden, isnow on her way to the United Kingdom to refit, Admiral Muselier having asked that Free French ships should no longer be used in the blockade of Djibouti. Thesloop Commandant Domine, which was to relieve her. is proceeding to theMediterranean. The torpedo boat Moqueuse and the trawler Reine des Flotswill also be stationed in the Mediterranean.Training.17. Training has been continued in most of the special branches and afurther sixty men have passed through BZ.M.S. Royal Arthur.Recruiting.18. The number of officers in the F.N.F.L. has increased by eighty andthe number of men by 450 during the quarter. The majority ofthese men were recruited from St. Pierre and Miquelon and include a number ofnaval reservists. It is this which will render the commissioning of two morecorvettes possible.Depot.19. The construction of a depot for 400 men at Emsworth, near Portsmouth,was started in February and should be finished during the summer.Frenchmen in the Royal Navy.20.   A few more ratings have transferred to the F.N.F.L.   Amongst thoseremaining in the Royal Navy there are a number of men who are either incapable of making themselves useful in British ships or who do not try to do so.   It was thought that these men might do better if they were formed into complete crewsfor small ships, but this has not been found practicable.   It is considered thatthe time is approaching when some of them, after a final warning, will have to bedisohRT-cvc&quot;-1
(ii) Army.Location.21.   Old Dean Common Camp, Camberley.Strength.22. ArmyOfficers3996Other Ranks.5191048613Air Force   ......Marines (Navy)Free French A.T.S.54722Employment.23. At the beginning of January 1942 a draft of Air Force left for theMiddle East, providing reinforcements for the Free French Bomber Squadronwhich has been active in the Libyan campaign. A small army draft also left forthe same destination. At the end of January 1942 a further army draft of forty-seven all ranks left for Equatorial Africa, including the personnel for the secondLight A.A. Battery in the Chad.24. Training has continued normally, the present organisation of the campbeing as follows :A administration Services Generaux (H.Q. Offices, &amp;c).Pare d&apos;Armee (M.T. Park and Storehouse).Service de Sante.Police Militaire.Subsistence (Personnel in transit).Volontaires Francaises (A.T.S.).Training Escadron mixte (Mounted units).Compagnie Portee (Infantry units).Aviation (Air Force under primary instruction).Fusiliers Marins (Marines).General de Gaulle visited the camp on the 27th February, 1942, and inspected thetraining in progress. Items included minor tank manoeuvres, an infantry attack,and demonstrations by officer cadets. A highly successful and instructive fieldexercise took place on the following day in conjunction with a battalion of theRoyal West Kents.25. Instructional courses with British Schools and Training Units continue.Two officers have attended gunnery courses at Larkhill, two officers are nowattending a British commando course, and a party of parachutists, sixteen strong,attended a course of training at the Polish parachute training centre. Para-chutists are now part of the Free French Air Force. Six n.c.os. attended a courseof A.F.V. driving and maintenance at Bovington, and a party of armourer-mechanics and driver-mechanics have been attached to Canadian units forinstructional courses.26. The results of the examination held in March 1942 showed that few ofthe officer cadets (Eleves-Aspirants) came up to expectation, only two of the classqualifying, but that of the n.c.o&apos;s. class did much better, and, in fact, beat mostof the cadets in the tests.27. The first party of women of the Corps des Volontaires Francaises have started living at the camp. It is intended gradually to replace men as drivers,office clerks and telephone operators.Equipment.28. Some of the weapons authorised for release in November 1941 have notyet been delivered and none of the ammunition has yet been supplied. Shortageof - 300-inch ammunition in particular remains a problem.
Welfare.29.   Satisfactory.   Under a newly appointed sports officer there are welcomesigns of organized classes in P.T., boxing and fencing for all ranks.   The camphas managed extremely well through the very cold winter, and there has been little sickness.Morale.30.   Good.(iii) Air Force.Recruiting.31. During the period twelve officers and sixty-six other ranks have been incorporated into the Free French Air Force in the United Kingdom.Morale.32. Morale in the United Kingdom is good, but in the Middle East it has fallen somewhat since the Free French Bomber Squadron were informed, after being withdrawn from the line, that they could not be re-equipped for somemonths.Training (see also Appendix VIII).33.   During the period under review 34 Free Frenchmen entered Initial Training Wing.1 Free Frenchman entered Elementary Air Observer School.3 Free Frenchmen  entered Air Gunnery School to complete their training as Wireless Operator /Air Gunners.9 Free Frenchmen qualified as Service pilots.General.34. No. 340 (Free French) Fighter Squadron has been re-equipped withSpitfires Mark V, and is about to be moved into a more active theatre of operations.General de Gaulle visited this Squadron on the 13th February.35. The Air Ministry have agreed in principle to a proposal made by theFree French Authorities that they should send a number of pilots to man a fighter Squadron on the Russian Front. The Air Ministry have made a conditiongoverning their acceptance of the proposals that the Royal Air Force is not committed to train French pilots to replace wastage in Russia, or to provide fromthe United Kingdom resources aircraft or maintenance personnel.36. With reference to the second paragraph of paragraph 22 of the nineteenth Report, General Odic has been dismissed from the Free French AirForce by General de Gaulle.Communication Aircraft.37. As a result of a recent request from the United States for the use ofPointe Noire as an air base, General de Gaulle has demanded eight LockheedLodestars for the defence of his territory and for use on internal air linesconnecting French Equatorial Africa with Syria, It is unlikely that the AirMinistry will be able to make any aircraft of this type available for the present.B. POLISH.(i) Navy.38. It has been said by a British officer who has had Polish and other Alliedships under his command : &quot; They share our sorrows and rejoice at our victoriesin a manner which makes them seem closest to us of all our Allies; they have thegift of being sympathetic rather than critical and enthusiastic instead of envious.&quot;Operations.39. The destroyers have been working with zeal and efficiency on convoy escourt, and it is being suggested that some of them should be employed occasionallywhere they will have greater opportunities for action.
40. The Garland, since she hoisted the Polish flag in May 1940, hasparticipated in the protection of forty-eight convoys and steamed 100,000 miles.41. The two Polish destroyers Krakowiak and Kujawiak took part in the raid on the Lofoten Islands in January.42. The Kujawiak, while on convoy escort duty, recently shot down one enemy plane and probably damaged a second.Recruiting Ships Commissioning and Paying-off.43. The arrival of the Polish recruits from Russia has been delayed. Thepresent position in so far as the Navy is concerned is that they hope to receiveabout 750 men in June. On this assumption the Chief of the Polish Navy has asked the Admiralty to allocate a cruiser of the &quot; Fiji &quot; Class in the Spring of1943.   The matter is under consideration.44. The Destroyer Burza having been paid-off for a long refit, the Poleshave been offered, and have accepted, a third &quot; Hunt &quot; Class Destroyer, the Bedale,for which the Polish name Slonjak has been suggested. She is due to commissionin May.45. The Submarine Wilk is laid-up at Devonport and the question ofrefitting her will not be considered until July.Recruiting.46. Of the sixty recruits from North America, about half have been foundunsuitable and are being sent back to Canada.47. The assimilation of the personnel who arrived from Russia in Januaryis proceeding.  It was found that they were much in need of rest and recuperation.Rest Home.48. The Royal Sussex Hotel at Brighton has been taken over for use as aRest Home for Polish Naval officers and men.(ii) Army.Establishment.49.

The Polish Forces have taken part in over a dozen exercises duringthe quarter, including the testing of the landward defences of the Forth and the defences of the aerodromes at Crail, Arbroath, Leuchars and Donibristle.Demonstrations.55. A demonstration of infiltration tactics was carried out by a brigade group, supported by the Polish Army Co-operation Squadron, in the Glenfargarea. This demonstration was attended by a large number of spectators,including representatives of Scottish Command Headquarters and other Britishformations, the Home Guard and the U.S.S.R. Military Attache to the PolishGovernment.56. The battalion of the Training Brigade training in parachute dutiesgave a demonstration of preliminary parachute training to War Correspondents.This consisted of physical training, exercises in the management of a parachutein the air, and on landing and jumping, from the practice tower. This was followed by an &quot;Assault Exercise,&quot; to demonstrate the methods by whichparachute troops can overcome obstacles during attacks on fortified strong points.Artillery Practice.57. Firing practices have been carried out by the Field Regiments and an anti-Tank shoot with 40-mm. guns by the Light A.A. unit.A.F.V. Training.58. One of the Brigade Groups has started instructional centre to trainseven officers and sixty men per regiment. All three regiments of this Brigaderun classes in the employment of armoured formations and tank tactics.Signals.59. There are now 270 students undergoing instruction at the Polish SignalsTraining Centre. Two classes are in progress for officers going to Russia inaddition to the two normal classes for cadets.60. The workshops are busy fulfilling Government orders for 50 &quot;BuzzerKeys.&quot;
61. A mine defector invented by Lieutenant Kosacki has been adopted bythe Government and is being manufactured by various firms. This officer is now engaged in working .out an adaption of his detector for use with Tanks. He hasalso invented an &quot; amplifier &quot; for use with Field Telephones.Courses and A ttachments.62. In addition to the large number of courses the Poles run themselves, anumber of officers and N.C.O&apos;s. have attended courses at our schools and completed attachments to British units.Co-operation with Home Guard.63. Arrangements were made for a Polish unit to train the Home Guardat Leven in unarmed combat. A demonstration of tanks and carriers was also given to the Montrose-Home Guard.Special Training.64. A series of courses in ski training have been carried out at a ski-training school and proved a great success, the snow having been plentiful and the country-most suitable. Students &quot; lived hard &quot; on the courses and the training was takenvery seriously.Combined Operations.65. A skeleton battalion did three weeks&apos; combined training at the combined operations Training Centre in Scotland run by the Royal Navy.309 (P) Squadron, R.A.F.66. This squadron has carried out a number of exercises in gas spray with british units, including Home Guard. The pilots now have considerable experience in this form, of attack, having done much training with troops of thePolish Corps, as well as with British units.Teaching of English.67. Fifteen Polish Staff Officers attended a course in English at the PolishMilitary Bureau, Edinburgh.68. A total of sixty-one Polish personnel are attending courses to fit them as instructors in English. The total number of trained instructors is now about120.fRecruits and Drafts.69. About 230 recruits have joined from South America and Canada and124 officers have left for Russia.Yugoslav Unit.,70. The eleven officers and thirty-seven other ranks who had been attachedto one of the Polish formations left the contingent for service overseas.M edical.71. Arrangements have been made for the acquisition by the polish authorities of Auchentroig Auxiliary Hospital, Buchlyvie, with a capacity offorty beds, in order to accommodate chronic service invalids and so release beds in the Polish Military Hospitals required for recoverable cases.72. Seventy Polish water duty personnel have been trained by the PolishField Hygiene Section since last December.73. Arrangements are in hand for courses in rehabilitation for Polishdischarged soldiers.74.   Arrangements have been made with the Department of Health forScotland for the utilisation of the services of Polish military medical officers with a special knowledge of Typhus Fever, in case of an outbreak of that disease.[23709] &apos; c
Security.75.   Satisfactory. tWelfare.76.   Satisfactory.Morale.77.   Good.Decorations.78. On the 24th January the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, ScottishCommand, presented O.B.E&apos;s to two Polish officers.79. On the 17th February Lieutenant-General Kukiel, Commanding thePolish Army Corps, attended Buckingham Palace and was invested by HisMajesty The King with the Insignia of the K.C.B. (Honorary Member).Visits.80. During the quarter the Polish Forces were visited by the General OfficerCommanding 3rd A.A. Division, senior officers from Scottish Command, general headquarters, Home Forces, and the War Office.Note by Inspector of A Hied Contingents.81. Following on several conversations between the C.I.G.S., the Com-mander-in-Chief, Home Forces, the V.C.I.G.S., and General Sikorski, thepreliminary steps towards a Polish Armoured Division have been taken. It isnot possible at this stage to issue an establishment for this formation, as it depends upon available equipment and Polish man-power in this country, andalso upon the most suitable proportion of Infantry to tanks. Certain Polishunits who will be incorporated in the Armoured Division are being moved southof the Forth to a better training area, and General Maczek has been nominatedto command. The result of these moves in Scotland is that Angus and Perthshirewill be vacated by the Poles, except for the hospitals at Taymouth Castle andDupplin Castle, and that General Kukiel, with his Headquarters and our No. 4Liaison Headquarters, will move to a more central locality.82. Throughout the training of the Armoured Division arrangements willbe made to ensure that all the troops will be able to take the field at very short notice on &quot; action stations.&quot; &apos;(iii) Air Force.Order of Battle (see also Appendix III).83. During the quarter under review there has been no change in thenumber or equipment of Polish Operational Squadrons. All are fullyoperational.Operations (see also Appendix V).84. The four Bomber Squadrons have been employed in night-bombing raidsover the Ruhr and Western Germany as well as over the Channel ports.85. Operations have generally been hampered by adverse weather conditions,and on the only occasion on which Polish Bombers took part in day operationstwo Squadrons took off to attack the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau during theGerman fleet&apos;s escape through the Channel, but failed to make contact with the target.The Bomber Squadrons are showing great keenness and efficiency, are most-punctual in taking off and are acquiring R.A.F. Signals procedure very satisfac-satisfactorily. A tendency to bomb from too great a height has been noted, but this faultis being corrected.
Training (see also Appendix VIII).86.   During the period under review 111 Poles entered Initial Training Wing.37 Poles entered Elementary Air Observer School.63 Poles entered the Signals School.22 Poles (Wireless Operator /Air Gunners) 1 entered Air Gunnery42 Poles (Air Gunners) J    School.28 Poles qualified as Service Pilots.27 Poles qualified for flying duties.Station Defence.87. Arising out of the policy that all personnel on R.A.F. Stations are toassist in Station Defence should the necessity arise, Polish Land Army officers were attached to various R.A.F. Stations on which Polish Units are located inorder to assist in the training of P.A.F. personnel in Station Defence duties.These Army Officers have now been withdrawn and replaced by P.A.F. Officers,all of whom have been specially trained as Station Defence Instructors.Recruiting.88. Up to the 1st March, 1942, 175 recruits reached this country for trainingfrom North America. About 55 per cent, of these were selected for aircrewtraining, and about 14 per cent, have for various reasons been rejected for service with the Polish Air Force. The majority of these rejects have been or are to be repatriated to North America.89. Up to the 31st March, 1942, approximately 60 officers and 290 airmenof the Polish Air Force have reached the United Kingdom from Russia and havebeen accepted for service.- Of these also, about 55 per cent, have been selected foraircrew duties. It is expected that a further 2,000 personnel for the Polish AirForce will be evacuated to this country. Of this figure, it is probable that therewill be many who have never really served in the Polish Air Force, but who ascivilians have received a measure of flying training.90. During the period under review thirty-two volunteers from the Polesreaching this country from South America are in process of being transferred from the Polish Land Army to the Polish Air Force. Most of these will probablybe selected for ground duties.M or ale.91. Reports received from Operational Commands indicate that morale is most satisfactory.  Morale is also good amongst Poles under training.C. DUTCH.(i) Navy.92. The situation in the Far East has naturally been uppermost in the minds of officers and men .of the Netherlands Navy serving in this country. Inspite of the losses of ships, men and territory, morale has not been affected and iseverywhere excellent.93. The Captain of the Submarine O. SI, now refitting in this country afterservice in the Mediterranean, has been awarded a bar to his D.S.O. TheFirst Lieutenant received a D.S.C. Two D.S.M.&apos;s and four mentions in despatches,were also awarded to members of this ship&apos;s company.Ships commissioned and to commission shortly.94. The Destroyer Jan van Galen (formerly Noble) was commissioned inFebruary and is now working up. Her sister ship, the Tjerk Hiddes (formerlyNonpareil), is now due to commission in May.95. One of four M.T.B.&apos;s has been commissioned and the second one will beready shortly.  The remaining two have been delayed.96. Three motor minesweepers are being built for the Dutch and will becompleted during the year.[23709] c 2
Ships Paid Off.97. The Torpedo Boats Z. 5 and Z. 5 have been paid off and also the GunBoat Gruno and the Trawler Notre-Dame de France.Personnel.98. A number of Dutch Naval Officers and ratings from the Dutch east indies are expected to reach this country during the next few months, but it isnot yet possible to say how many. It is, however, almost certain that there willbe enough to man a cruiser, and Admiral Furstner has made tentative enquires as to whether the Admiralty would be disposed to make one available. A definiterequest on the part of the Netherlands Government may be expected.99. About 150 Cadets and staff from the Naval College at Sourabaya will reach this country in due course, and the Netherlands Naval Authorities have asked if the Admiralty could arrange for the Netherlands Cadets Trainingestablishment near Falmouth to be enlarged for their reception. This and alternative proposals are under consideration.Movements of Ships.100. The Cruiser Heemskerck and the Submarine Depot Ship Colombia arenow at Colombo. Three Submarines, formerly in the Dutch East Indies, are with her, and 0. 23, just refitted in the United Kingdom, is on her way to the East.Two more will follow on completion of their refits.101. The Destroyer Isaac Sweers, which was in the Mediterranean, has alsoproceeded to Colombo.   She may have to return here shortly for refit.102. The Minesweeper Jan van Brakel is to sail for the Dutch West Indies,where she will be employed on anti-submarine duties.(ii) Army.Establishment.103.

Employment. .107. Although normal training has continued and the Dutch Forces havetaken part in a few exercises, there was a certain unsettling effect in the Brigadedue to arrangements to send further reinforcements to the Netherlands east indies. The decision to send these reinforcements was, however, cancelled earlyin March.Recruits.108. Five officers and about 130 other ranks have joined the Contingentfrom Canada and South Africa.Drafts.109. Over 100 other ranks have left the Brigade for training as gunners inthe Merchant Navy.Home Guard.110. Two Home Guard officers have been appointed as Liaison Officersbetween the Dutch Brigade and the Home Guard.Security.111. There were breaches of security in connexion with the move of thedetachment to the Netherlands East Indies, but steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence and security arrangements are now satisfactory, a sense of security-mindedness increasing throughout the Brigade.Welfare.112. Satisfactory. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Thomas Cook, M.P., visited the camp in February and discussed welfare in general with the &quot;Dutch welfare officers.  &apos;Morale.113. Satisfactory, though there is, however, a very general feeling ofboredom in the camp over the continuing &apos;&apos; waiting on &apos;&apos; for active service and the constant taking of drafts for the other services.Visits.114. The Brigade has been visited by officers from Headquarters, WesternCommand, General Headquarters, Home Forces, and the War Office, includingthe Inspector of Allied Contingents.Death of Dutch Inspector-General.115. Lieutenant-General G. B. Noothoven van Goor, C.B., Inspector-General of the Dutch Forces, died in hospital at Wolverhampton on the12th March, a few days after an operation for appendicitis. He was buried atWolverhampton on the 16th. A representative gathering of British officersattended the funeral, the Inspector of Allied Contingents representing the british army and the Commander-General, Midland District, representing the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command. The Commanders and detach-ments from the Czechoslovak and Belgian Contingents were also present.Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents.116. The Dutch Contingent is at the moment in a rather unsettled conditionowing to their having earmarked reinforcements for the Dutch East Indies(which were in the end cancelled), to the death of General Noothoven, not yetreplaced, and to heavy calls on them for other services. This matter has been represented to the Dutch authorities in London, and it is hoped that the situation may be tidied up, and that this fine body of men may get into their stride again.All they require is that the strength of the Contingent shall be stabilized by their government deciding on the proportion of available men to be allotted to each service, by filling the two vacancies in Command, and by deciding how far in the
circumstances they can proceed with their present organization. They areexpecting more recruits.In the meanwhile, special training is being given to as many as can be taken at our schools of that nature, and they have been given sixteen places in thepresent course at the Sandhurst O.C.T.U.(hi) Air Force.Royal Dutch Naval Air Service.Order of Battle (see also Appendix III). .117.

Units of the Brigade have been inspected by Senior British officers ofthe Western Command and a visit was paid by the Inspector of Allied Contingentswith Mr. Nicholls, the British Minister to the Czechoslovak Government.Note by the Inspector of Allied Contingents.131. The Czechs are still feeling the lack of recruits, and are unlikely toreach their full establishment in this country. The units that are formed are well equipped and well trained and together make a mixed Brigade of highfighting value. Of all the Allied Contingents, they have been the readiest toco-operate with us in every possible way and made the fewest demands. It isa pity that they cannot be amongst our best troops for a time, and exercised withand against them, for value to both sides would result. The Ceramander-in-Chief,Home Forces, and the Army Commander are considering the possibility of movingtheir fighting units to some other part of the country for the summer months.132. The Army Commander rates them as a very useful mobile fighting force&apos;,(ii) Air Force,Operations (see also Appendix V).133. No. 311 Squadron was employed in night bombing raids over the ruhr, Western Germany and the Channel ports.134. During the first month the squadron was able to operate on six nights,two aircraft failing to return. In the second month the squadron operated onseven nights and one day, one aircraft failing to return. In the third month the squadron took part in the recent successful attack on the Renault Worksnear Paris.135. Bad weather conditions generally made difficult the location of primarytargets and the observation of results. Although the squadron took off to intercept the Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen when they escaped throughthe Channel, it was unable to intercept. Nevertheless, an improvement in nightphotography has been noticed.
136. Bad weather also having impeded the work of the operational trainingflight, the number of crews available for operations has recently dropped.Recruiting. - -137. Four Officers (selected for Observer Training) and forty-one privateshave been transferred from the Czech army; eleven recruits have arrived from canada.Training (see also Appendix VIII).138.   During the period under review 13 Czechoslovaks entered Initial Training Wing;12 Czechoslovaks entered Elementary Air Observer School;6 Czechoslovaks entered Air Gunnery School;15 Czechoslovaks qualified as Service Pilots.139. The operational training of Czech Bomber crews has for a considerable time been carried out within No. 311 Squadron. In the middle of December 1941,however, a small Operational Training Unit equipped with 10 + 2 Wellington and2 + 1 Oxford aircraft was established at East Wretham as No. 1420 Flight.Station Defence.140.

Morale in all Czech Squadrons is good.E.-NORWEGIAN.(i) Navy.142. General Ffansteen has been appointed Supreme Commander-in-Chiefof the Norwegian Naval and Military Forces. The immediate control of theNavy remains in the hands of the naval Staff as heretofore and up to now thenew appointment has not made any material difference.143. The Captain of the destroyer Bath has been awarded the D.S.C. Inaddition the Norwegian Navy received three D.S.M.&apos;s and seven mentions indespatches, during the quarter. This has given over much satisfaction in theNorwegian fleet.Ships commissioned and to commission shortly.144.   Another M.T.B. has been added to the Flotilla, which now numbersfive.&apos; 145. The destroyer Mansfield has been paid off, as she was due for a longrefit, and the Lincoln, of the same class, has been commissioned in her place.146. The Potentilla was commissioned in January and there are now fiveNorwegian-manned corvettes.147. The destroyer Glaisdale is due to complete in April and great interest is being taken by the Norwegians in commissioning this new ship.148. The submarine Uredd completed her working up at the end of lastyear and has been carrying out patrol duties. She has been favourably reported on.149. The Norwegian naval authorities agreed to the Admiralty&apos;s request that the torpedo boat Draug should be used for Submarine Escort Duties for ashort period and it is now under consideration to employ her as a training ship,keeping her fully manned and ready for sea.150. The destroyer Sleipner has been taken in hand for a six weeks&apos; refitand alterations in armament to bring her more up to date.

Recruiting for the navy has been almost at a standstill, as no suitablemen have been getting over from Norway. It is, however, reported that about five thousand men, most of whom are of the seaman or fisherman classes, are nowin Sweden and anxious to come to this country.153. About three hundred men are being trained in Canada as D.E.M.S.gunners.(ii) Army.Establishment. Officers.        Other Ranks.154.

Visits.164.165. At the end of February the late Commander-in-Chief of the NorwegianArmy (Major-General Fleischer) visited the Contingent to bid them farewell onhis retirement.166. The Inspector of Allied Contingents visited the Brigade and visitswere also made by ordnance and catering representatives from Scottish Command.Notes by Inspector of A Hied Contingents.167. The Norwegians have recently adopted a new system of Command, and major-General ELansteen has been brought in to be Commander-in-Chief of theirNavy, Army and Air Force. Major-General Beichmann has been appointedCommander-in-Chief vof the Norwegian Army, and Major-General Karl Fleischer,K.C.B., has retired after notable service both with the troops and with theMinistry in London.168. Following on these changes, the principles of the present use and futurecharacter of the Norwegian defence services have been examined in two notes,copies of which have been sent to the War Office, Home Forces and ScottishCommand, and concrete proposals for certain changes in the organisation of theNorwegian Contingent are gradually emerging.169. The Norwegians are being concentrated in Ross-shire so that the disadvantages of the 250 miles separation of the training from the fighting units will disappear.170.   This Contingent is in good heart and making real progress.(iii) Air Force.Training.171. During the period unde^ review, two Norwegians entered SignalsSchool for training as Wireless Operator/Air Gunners. The bulk of Norwegiantraining is still carried out in Canada.Recruiting.172. Recruits are still reaching this country from Norway and Sweden,but there is a falling off in the recruiting of Norwegian Air personnel in canada and the United States.Morale.173.   Morale remains high.General.174.

BELGIAN,(i) Navy. )Ships Commissioned and to Corhmfssion Shortly.175. The corvette Godetia was commissioned in February. The First Lordsent a signal to the ship conveying his good wishes, which was much appreciated.The entire ship&apos;s company, with the exception of the Commanding Officer andthree ratings, are Belgian.  She is now working up.176. The completion of the corvette Buttercup has been delayed until earlyApril.Training.177. H.M.S. Royal Arthur reports very favourably on the Belgians, whohave been under training, particularly in Signals and Wireless. They have made good progress in the English language and also in Physical Training.
178. One of the Belgian Cadets at Dartmouth has passed out top of allthe Special Entry Cadets, which, in view of having to learn technical subjects in a foreign language, may be considered a most meritorious performance. Theother three Cadets also passed out very satisfactorily.Recruiting.179. The number of Belgian ratings has only increased by twenty duringthe quarter, as recruiting has been almost at a standstill owing to continueddelay in drawing up regulations for the conscription by the Allied Governmentsof their nationals in British territory.National Flag.180. The Admiralty have given their approval to a request from theBelgian Government to fly the Belgian Flag side by side with the White Ensign,and this is known to have given great satisfaction in Belgian quarters. It hasalso been approved that the Belgian officers, although holding commissions in theR.N.R. or R.N.V.R., may wear a badge indicative of their nationality.(ii) Army.Establishment.181.

Employment.186. In addition to normal training, the Belgian Brigade have taken partin a number of important exercises. In one of these exercises a British battalionwas placed under the command of the Belgian Commander. The Headquarterstaff took part in a large Home Defence Exercise; this was most successful andthe headquarters worked efficiently.187.   The Field Battery carried out practice firing at Trawsfynydd.Security.188.   Satisfactory.Welfare.189. Satisfactory.

During the quarter the Belgian units have been inspected by theCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces, and the Inspector of Allied Contingents.Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents.192. The Belgian troops are to be moved back into Wales in about a month&apos;s time. Their old Guy armoured cars have been replaced by Humbers; they havealso received quite a lot of miscellaneous equipment and are pretty well off in that respect.   Transport, being in short supply, is their principal demand.193. There has been a recrudescence of somewhat bitter discussion amongstthem on the subject of the political future of Belgium, and certain senior officers are supposed to be in favour of a Fcoyal Dictatorship, and to be in some senseplanning to that end. This is being watched as closely as may be, lest it go sofar as to affect the discipline of the Contingent. It is perhaps unfortunate thatthe temperament and strong personality of the Commander are such as to make him, with or without his volition or consent, likely to be regarded as a protagonist.It is certain that more active conditions of service would cure all this, and I amasking that some Belgians may be taken on one of our raids.(iii) Air Force.Recruiting.194. 50 Belgians have been enlisted for ground duties and these havebeen posted or are awaiting posting.to Technical Training Schools. A further16 are being considered for enlistment.195. A number of trained or partly trained Belgian Air Force pilots haveescaped to this country, of whom 13 have been commissioned and 4 enlisted inthe R.A.F.V.R.Training (see also Appendix VIII).196.   During the period under review -31 Belgians have entered Initial Training Wing.1 Belgian has qualified        Service Pilot.197. The Air Ministry have tagreed to accept every three months up to50 Belgians for training as pilots or, if already trained, for service.Morale.198.   Morale is high.
G. GREEK.(i) Navy.Destroyer Crews.199. One hundred and forty Greek Naval personnel who represent half crewsfor two destroyers arrived in this country early in March. With the exceptionof a few engine room personnel who are standing by the Bolebroke and Border,on the Tyne, the Greeks have been accommodated at the R.N. Barracks, Chatham,and Training in all branches is proceeding. The first impressions of the menare that they are well disciplined and keen to learn, but the language difficulty is retarding progress. Very few amongst them speak enough English to actas interpreters. A number of Greeks in this country are being specially enteredin the Greek Navy for duty as interpreters.200. Two more crews are already on their way from Alexandria and.Bombay and it is, therefore, expected that the Bolebroke and Border willcommission in May and June. A fourth crew will be ready to leave Alexandriaat the end of April and it should be possible to commission the third and fourthDestroyers in, August and September.201. About 100 Naval reservists who were employed in the Greek merchant service in this country are being recruited and, after general disciplinarytraining at Chatham, will be used to bring the four crews to full strength.202.   The question of manning two submarines is in abeyance for the present.(ii) Air Force.Operations.203. In Middle East Command the Greek G.R. Flight remains active andthe Greek Fighter Squadron is now operational.Morale.204.   Reports from Middle East state that morale is good.General.205. An agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the GreekGovernment relating to the organisation and employment of the Greek armed forces has been signed. It provides for the entry of R.H.A.F. personnel intothe R.A.F.V.R.(i) Air Force. H.   YUGOSLAV.Operations.206. No. 2 Yugoslav Squadron has been operating under Middle east command mainly on anti-submarine patrol. The Squadron has, however, onlyfive aircraft (Do. 22) left, of which only one is reported as serviceable. Thequestion of the re-equipment of this Squadron is under consideration by middle east Command.Morale.207. Morale in No. 2 Yugoslav Squadron is reported to be good. Elsewheremorale has been gravely undermined by a crisis over the Yugoslav High Command.Training,208. All, or almost all, personnel have been removed from Amman and arenow in Egypt. It was intended that all Yugoslavs in the Middle East, exceptingfully trained personnel, should proceed for training to Southern Rhodesia. this movement has had to be deferred owing to the crisis in Cairo referred to above.In the meantime, three officers and twenty-two other ranks have left the UnitedKingdom for Southern Rhodesia.Great George Street, S.W. 1,April 22, 1942.
Remarks on Welfare of Allied Navies.The Allies have opened a number more clubs, canteens and hostels in the ports which are visited by their ships.Arrangements which have been made for private hospitality continue to bemuch appreciated. Many Allied officers have been invited to join London Clubsas honorary members.A scheme is being drawn up to meet the needs of officers and men of theUnited States Navy and Merchant Service in United Kingdom and NorthernIreland Ports.  The American Red Cross is co-operating.Duty-free stores have been made available to certain categories of Alliedships which were not previously eligible.Special attention has been paid to the welfare of Allied fishermen.

Note on the Transfer of certain Training to Canada.Consequent upon the decision to transfer to R.A.F. transferred schools iniCanada the work of all but one R.A.F. Service Flying Training School (College) 1and the Polish School (No. 16 (P) S.F.T.S:), it has been necessary, in agreement Iwith the various national authorities to arrange for all Free French, Czechoslovak, 1Dutch, Belgian, and some Polish pupil pilots to be sent to Canada to complete 1their Flying Training. For the present the Polish Elementary and Service jFlying Training Schools will remain in England.Although arrangements have been made to complete the training of a few Imore Allied Air Observers in the United Kingdom, the rule in future will be that IAir Observers, as well as pupil pilots, must complete their training in Canada.   during the period under review the following Allied pupil pilots andobservers have left the United Kingdom for Canada : Free French   ...      ...      ... 10 pupil pilots.Poles   ...      ...      ...      ... -28 pupil pilots.21 pupil observers.Czechs ...      ...      ... 13 pupil pilots.Belgians        ...      ...      ...    1 pupil pilot.
