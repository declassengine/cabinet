9TH APRIL, 1942.WAR CABINET.ANTI-GAS PRECAUTIONS.REPORT BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet(W.M.(42) 36th Conclusions, Minute 3)  I have reviewed the  stateof our civilian anti-gas precautions and submit the following report on the results of ray inquiry.2. Since the previous review which I carried out a year ago(see W.P. (-1-1)94) there has been an all round improvement in thestate of preparedness achieved,   . In certain instances, however,to which I refer below, I have found it necessary, to arrangefor further steps to be taken in order to stimulate progress orto check the results already achieved.Publicity.3. With the lull in raiding since last spring, there hasinevitably been a slackening of interest in gas questions on thepart of the public and this has had some effect upon thestandard of training in the special anti-gas services and alsoupon the general education of the public.      While any large-scale publicity campaign would clearly be undesirable in presentcircumstances, public exercises using tear gas preceded by apublic warning, which have been carried out throughout thecountry during the past months, should be continued, exeeptwhere these would, cause serious dislocation of the war effort.The canvass referred to in paragraph 12 below, should alsoprove useful in stimulating public interest.respecting irators.4. There has been no general inspection of respirators sincethe review a year ago, but a running check is kept on theircondition through inspection by wardens, and it is, for the mostpart, believed to be satisfactory.      The civilian respirator isa comparatively fragile article and wastage is governed primarily by the extent to which it is carried.      The carrying ofrespirators is now comparatively rare except by school childrenbut among that group wastage up to 100^ a year has been reported from some areas.      Wastage on this scale is obviously undesirablenow that there is a shortage of rubber.      Nevertheless I do not regard it as practicable at the present time to vary theinstructions issued to local education authorities and to thePublic generally that respirators should be carried.    I have asked that Regional Commissioners should be instructed to reporton the frequency with which inspections of gas masks have beencarried out in each local authority area and on the results obtained.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).- ^ ...S j C R E T.W^P.

Gas Identification Service.,5* As a result of the introduction of a new method oftesting, the practical value of the Gas Identification service has been much enhanced.      This service consists of approximately,500 part time but highly trained workers, and it is essentialthat its strength should not be depleted by other calls ofnational service.      I have invited the Ministry of Labour andthe Ministry of Home Security to consider each caseindividually and to arrange wherever possible for deferment ofcall-up.Gas Warnings.6. An improved form of hand rattle has been introduced and progress has been made in providing a special form of warning signal in coastal areas.      The  possibility of damage to commercial factories producing gas for industrial or war purposes creates a special problem, since the danger might arise very suddenly.      I have asked the Ministry of home security,  in consultation with the Ministry of Supply, toconsider whether special arrangements can be made, e.g. by theuse of factory sirens, for giving rapid warning to the public in the immediate neighbourhood in the event of damage to these factories.      I have also recommended that vehicles used fortransporting large gas containers should be equipped with handrattles for use in case of accident.Cleansing of the Public.7. Some bi million ounces of anti-gas ointment No,2have been sold to industry and to retail chemists.      Sales tothe public have fallen off in recent months.8. There has been a considerable expansion during thepast year in the number of public gas cleansing centres-completed.      Present plans provide for 3,000 of these, ofwhich 1,800 are attached to first aid posts.      Most of thelatter have now been completed.      The position is less satisfactory in the case of separate cleansing centres sinceon 31st December last some 400 out of a total of 1,200 werenot ready.      The position will be reviewed in the light ofthe returns due for 31st. March.9i In addition to fixed cleansing centres, 800 mobilecleansing units have been supplied to local authorities sndanother 200 are either on order or awaiting distribution.10. Equipment is being supplied to these centres includingemejrgency clothing for the use of the public, and protectiveclothing for the staff. &apos;    The stocks of emergency clothingare small but are being supplemented in various ways.11. The staffing of cleansing centres is presenting some difficulty.      To meet the first gas attacks, authorities havebeen urged to secure a first line team with a small trainedreserve.      To meet continued attacks, however, a larger staff would be necessary.      Authorities are being urged to trainother civil defence workers in gas cleansing,  and in Londonendeavours are being made to use part time Wardens to staff the centres.      If found satisfactory, these arrangements will be adopted in other parts of the country.

12, In dealing with mustard gas, the first line of defencemust .be the use of washing facilities in private houses, andthe public has been so instructed in a leaflet issued on thesubject.      In some parts of the country good progress has beenmade in organising a home gas cleansing service, but little hasbeen done as regards the country as a whole.      I have requested the Ministry of Health to instruct Regional Commissioners topress on vigorously with arrangements for a selective canvassof householders in their Regions to enlist their co-operation in providing cleansing facilities in their homes.      It is alsohoped that volunteers may be obtained by this means to  serve atthe public gas cleansing centres.13. Good progress has been made in providing cleansingfacilities at railway stations.      Satisfactory arrangements have been made for the reception in hospitals of those whohave been injured as well as contaminated.Decontamination of Clothing.14. Some 880 centres are being provided for thedecontamination of clothing, mainly at commercial laundries.Although the laundries have undertaken to do the work, thefinal preparations have been held up by difficulties in thetraining of staff and in settling the charges to be made.In order that there may be no further delay on this score, Ihave asked the Department concerned to give urgent consideration to the question whether compulsory powers shouldbe taken15. There has been some complaint of a shortage of labour in laundries and I have asked the Minister of Labour toconsider the position of the laundry industry with a view to ensuring that sufficient staff is available to deal with thedecontamination of clothing.Decontamination. -.16. The manpower position in the decontamination servicestill gives some cause for anxiety but certain new factorsshould make the situation less acute.17. A new technique has been introduced for thedecontamination of streets, by using dry bleach.      This willenable the work to be done much more rapidly and easily,though larger quantities of bleach will be necessary.      Presentsupplies amount to some 36,000 tons and the target figure of40,000 tons will be reached by the end of May.      Oh the basisof this new technique a special effort is now being made toimprove training and to bring decontamination squads up to theproper degree of efficiency.      Rescue and first aid parties have been trained in decontamination work in order that theymay be able to assist the regular decontamination personnel,and a number of other steps are being taken to supplement the available staff.Foodstuffs.18. Good progress has been made during the past year inthe development of precautions against contamination of foodstuffs.      The schemes of 95% of the local authorities haveeither been approved or are nearing completion.      In additionto privately-owned tarpaulins, 40,000 specially proofedanti-gas sheets ore now held by Divisional Food Officers

throughout the country.      The total strength of Pood TreatmentSquads is now approximately 20,0009 but it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain it at this level owing toother demands upon manpower.19. Special arrangements have been made to deal with foodcontaminated in port areas.Industry and Public Utilities.20, Since the general review of anti-gas precautions in factories last year there has been continuous follow-up action by means of visits of inspection and detailed instructions.The Ministry of Supply report that anti-gas measures in factories- on their vital list are practically complete.      Ihove asked for a special report on the development ofemergency cleansing facilities particularly in smallfactories-.21. Further progress has also been made in the measuresadopted by the railway companies and by public utility undertakings.22. Special arrangements have been made for theventilation of mines in the event of gas attack and squadshave been provided to deal with decontamination at thepithead.      The precautions taken are being carefully reviewed.Co-ordination between Civil and Military Preparations.23. Provision has been made for close liaison between thecivil and military authorities in all anti-gas precautionssparticularly in exchange of information and in thedecontamination of clothing.24. Anti-gas precautions in the three Services haverecently formed the subject of an exhaustive review by theInter-Services Chemical Warfare Committee in a report submitted to the Chiefs of Staff,(Intld, )    CP.
