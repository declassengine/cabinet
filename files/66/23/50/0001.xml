THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  April 1942.MOST SECRET.W.P. (42) 170.April 22, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SPECIAL OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE.Note by the Secretary of the War Cabinet.THE annexed Report by the Minister of Economic Warfare is circulated,by the direction of the Prime Minister, for the information of the War Cabinet.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Great George Street, S.W. 1,April 22, 1942.ANNEX.Prime Minister,S.O.E.SINCE taking office I have made as thorough an inspection of S.O.E. itspersonnel, its offices and its schools as time has permitted. I have discussed its work with every Minister, Government official or organisation that has haddealings with S.O.E. I have also endeavoured to trace to their sources variousrumours which I have heard.S.O.E. was reorganised in the late summer of 1940 and the present establish-ment can be said to have started functioning in October 1940. I am greatly impressed both by the standard of personnel and the results achieved in such ashort time.The team presided over by Mr. Jebb and Sir Frank Nelson is remarkablefor its ability and initiative, and in Sir Charles Hambro, Colonel Taylor,Brigadier Gubbins, Air Commodore Boyle, Colonel Davies, Wing CommanderVenner, Colonel Clarke, Colonel Sporborg, Lord Glenconner, Colonel Barry andothers you have a first-class team working their hardest at a most difficult job.Rumours.I have investigated various rumours which alleged inefficiency andextravagance, &amp;c. I have no hesitation in reporting that these are baselesscalumnies, emanating generally from members of the staff who have been discharged for inefficiency. It may well be that in an organisation that wasimprovised in the middle of a great war and which has expanded with thegreatest rapidity while it operated, moving forward from bottleneck to bottle-[23731]Copy No.
neck, there have been temporary dislocations of organisation in certain depart-menls with consequent local surpluses of staff. The administration has beenfighting against time in establishing an organisation which ought to have beenprepared years ago, and steps have had to be taken hurriedly. Such teethingtroubles do not justify the rumours to which I refer.Finance.This is under the charge of a leading chartered accountant and noexpenditure has been incurred which has not been approved by the Treasury.The offices are controlled by experienced and well-known business men and I haveno doubt that they are conducted efficiently.Expenditure is running at the rate of about  2,500,000 per annum. Thevalue of the ships and cargoes now in Allied hands as a direct result of theactivities of S.O.E alone exceeds the total of last year&apos;s expenditure, to say nothing of very great damage inflicted on the enemy, the amount of which isincalculable. But the real justification for the expenditure is to be found in theorganisation that has been built up, most of which will not come into operation now the moment when it is called upon to function by the General Staff.Results achieved.Some 1,000 men have been trained in all the arts of sabotage and subversion,and W/T getting in and out of enemy territory, &amp;c. I have been greatly impressed by the high standard of technical efficiency reached by the schools thatI have visited. There are forty schools. This figure is not necessarily excessivebecause it is impossible to mix different nationalities, or different stages of instruction.Of the above trainees, over 200 men are at work in enemy-occupied countries with considerable stores of explosives, &amp;c, while another 100 are operating indifferent parts of the world. Some 900 are serving with the Allied armies, while350 are awaiting transport abroad. The main task of all agents operating in enemy-occupied territory is to form the nucleus of large indigenous groups andto promote a revolutionary situation.Moreover, though such exploits are not the most important part of its work, S.O.E. has taken an active or leading part in a number of daringepisodes, including the escape on two occasions from Sweden of British-chartered ships, the seizure of Axis ships at Feimando Po, the sinking of two large Italian ships in Tunis and other enemy ships in Greece, the interception of a large Vichy convoy, the capture of a large Vichy ship, the destruction ofthe power-station at Pessac, the temporary blocking of the Danube, the coupd&apos;Etat in Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav revolt, collaboration in the Lofoten, the st. Nazaire and other raids, &amp;c. In addition to the above, it has instigatedthousands of small acts of sabotage on the Continent, from railway accidents tothe insertion of abrasives in machine tools.Finally, the design and manufacture of a large quantity of special lethalweapons, wireless sets and secret devices of great moment has been undertakenand is proceeding on an important scale.   No bad record for eighteen months.Failures.S.O.E. failed to provide an efficient organisation in the Far East. InSiam and Malaya they were not allowed to operate effectively, but there wasfailure in other directions as well.There was also a failure in the Middle East until Sir Frank Nelson wentout in August 1941 and placed the organisation on its present satisfactory,basis.The fair and true comment on the above is that, if you attempt to create a world-wide organisation under war conditions in a hurry, some appointmentsand arrangements are likely to be less successful than others. The significantfact is that the failures have been very much fewer than the achievements.Relations with Other Departments.The relations between S.O.E. and the Services, C.C.O. and M.1.5 arecordial, but unfortunate friction has prevailed in the past with the ForeignOffice, mainly in connection with neutral countries. For instance, S.O.E. wasprevented fi&apos;om making any effective preparations in Siam by the confidence
of our Minister that the Siamese Government would not side with the enemy.Similarly, the Foreign Office has complained of S.O.E. activities in Turkey,Portugal and other countries.It has now been settled that the Foreign Secretary should assume full responsibility for all S.O.E. activities in neutral countries and that S.O.E.should take his directions about them. I am sure that this is the best arrange-ment. The primary responsibility for preparation in such areas is, thereby,placed upon the Foreign Office.I regret to report I have also found considerable friction between S.O.E.and C. The activities of these organisations necessarily overlap in many partsof the world. In my view it is essential that the points of mutual interest thatarise between them should be settled in a team spirit de die in diem. Forthis purpose I recommend the establishment of a liaison committee which should meet at least weekly, consisting of the heads of the two organisations preside over by a Conciliator of experience and standing. With such a machinery itshould be possible to settle disputes in their early stages. If the Conciliatorysolution were unacceptable to either party the matter would have to be referredto Ministerial levels, but I believe that this -would seldom be necessary.Discussions have taken place between the S.O.E. and the Ministry ofInformation on the subject of subversive propaganda. I am glad to say that agreement has now practically been reached.S.O.E. has had some difficulty in fitting in with other Departments, and nodoubt mistakes have been made on both sides, but S.O.E. must and will play forthe team.Development.S.O.E. has reached a stage where it is capable of very important expansion.The principal bottleneck to-day is the provision of transport. Many more&quot;agents&apos;&apos; have been trained than it has been found possible to transport to enemy-occupied territories. To drop an agent from a plane in a safe spot requiresalmost a full moon and fine weather. Few nights are therefore available. until december transport facilities were very inadequate, but since then the AirMinistry has placed at the disposal of S.O.E. five Halifaxes and eight Whitleys,while three Lysanders are shared with C. The Admiralty have given what helpthey can in fast motor boats for coastal landings. If these facilities could bedoubled full use would be made of them. There is particular need of more long-range fast planes as access to Poland and Czechoslovakia is impossible duringthe summer with present machines.A device to enable pinpoints to be located from the air has been evolved inthe form of a wireless beacon. The importance of this to S.O.E. will be immense,as it will enable agents and stores to be dropped on exact points without moonlight.It is of the utmost importance that the manufacture of these should be expeditedby all possible means.The Future.In eighteen months and by sheer hard work, under great difficulties, very fineresults have been accomplished by the personnel of S.O.E., who include in their number men of high distinction in business, the Law and the Services. They are naturally indignant at the rumours alluded to above, which have originated frominterested parties, and at the levity with which they have been given currencyby responsible persons who appear to have little idea of the difficulties inherent in their task. They themselves are precluded from any form of reply and theirprofessional reputations are at stake.If S.O.E. is to function, it must receive fair play as well as give it. Theserumours have got to cease, and I therefore propose to invite an impartial person of sufficient authority and experience to review the organisation of S.O.E. and theconditions under which it has to operate, and to advise me whether any improvement is possible.Meanwhile, I hope my colleagues will accept my assurance that much goodwork has been performed&apos; by zealous and patriotic men, and for this purpose should be grateful if you could see your way to circulate this Report to theWar CabiQet- SELBOENE.April 10, 1942.
