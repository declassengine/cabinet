(42) 156.April 10, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-SOVIET TREATIES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WITH reference to Conclusion 4 of the meeting of the War Cabinet on the8th April, I circulate to my colleagues drafts, which I would propose to use asf a basis for my discussions with the Soviet Ambassador on the two proposedjl Anglo-Soviet treaties.   Unless I hear to ^^^^c^toury^I ^cjilA^-pXQpxJSe^a^baw[I these ^^^JtQmMm^M^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^M^. Stalin has intimated&quot;11 tEaFne will wish to propose amenHments^to the drafts discussed in Moscow, but these have not yet been received.I would draw the attention of my colleagues to the passage in brackets inarticle 3 of the draft treaty for the settlement of post-war questions (Annex II).The proposal to include such a passage was on balance rejected by my colleagues on the ground that the Soviet Government could not be expected to recognise ina treaty the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to recover territory occupiedby the Japanese with whom the Soviet Government are not at war. I am advised,however, that such a stipulation could not be held to apply to territory occupiedby Japan since the whole treaty is confined to Europe. On the other hand, theinclusion of this provision would establish a principle which would be very useful if Russia is later at war with Japan. Moreover, I think it would be liable toadverse crticism, both in this country and abroad, if the obligations in thisarticle were entirely one-sided.A. E.April 10, 1942.11684   [23685]
