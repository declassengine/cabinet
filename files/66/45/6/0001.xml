(44) 6. \J6th January, 1944.WAR CABINET22Copy No. t)REINSTATEMENT IN CIVIL EMPLOYMENT BILL:   POSITION OFCIVIL DEFENCE PERSONNEL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.1. The Reconstruction Committee (R. (44) 1st Meeting) have been discussing the question whether under the new Bill the right of reinstatementshould be extended-., to whole-time volunteers in the Civil Defence, Police and fire Services. The majority decided against such an extension, but an important point of principle is involved, and before a final decision is taken I wish to bring to. the notice of the War Cabinet some of the considerations which have led meto press this proposal. - The position, as I see it, is as follows : 2. Hitherto Armed Forces and Civil Defence have been in the same positionin that only conscripts have reinstatement rights. While that bore hardly on civil Defence, where over 90 per cent, are volunteers, the position could at anyrate be defended, as far as any discrimination between conscripts and volunteersserving together could ever be defended. But I see great difficult)&apos;&apos; in defendingthe Minister of Labour&apos;s present proposal to withhold these rights from civil defence volunteers, while giving them to volunteers in the Armed Forces and various women&apos;s services.3. The case for equal treatment has been stated more than once, but perhaps i may summarise it: (a) Some of the Civil Defence Services are &apos;&apos; forces &apos;&apos; under the NationalService Act, 1941, viz., the National Fire Service, the Police WarReserve and the Civil Defence Reserve. To these &quot; forces &apos;-&apos; men andwomen may be posted, compulsoriiy or voluntarily, as a directalternative to the Armed Forces or the^Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services.They contain about half the total whole-time strength of civil defence, and one-fifth of them are conscripts and- therefore already covered. If the Bill is not amended service in them will continue tobe &quot;war service&quot; for conscripts and &quot;civil employment&quot; for volunteers, although they work side by side and under the same conditions of service.(b) There is no conclusive case on merits for treating these Forces differentlyfrom the rest of the Civil Defence Services, and, apart from merits,there would be practical difficulties : in the Civil Defence Reserve,which provides the Mobile Reserve Columns of Civil Defence and ismanned in part by local authority reserve personnel posted to it in rotation, and the personnel of the &apos;&apos; force &apos;&apos; and the &apos;&apos; service &apos;&apos; beinginterchangeable.(c) All the Services are akin to the Armed Forces rather than to industry.Their pay is assimilated as closely as possible; they have no hourlyrates, no limited hours of duty and no overtime; leave, sick pay andinjury allowances are comparable; the residential units live and workin similar conditions, and many others, although not serving withresidential units, have been severed from their homes. Moreover, itis to be expected that thousands of members of these Services will betransferred to the vital areas in connection with forthcomingoperations, and will be serving alongside the Army and under thesame conditions. It will be recalled that this happened during the&quot; Harlequin &quot; exercise.[26685]
(d) Like the Army, Civil Defence had its influx of unemployed and casualsat the beginning of the war, but many men and women gave up steadyemployment to enter Civil Defence because it was represented by ministers and others to be as important in every way as service in the armed Forces. Moreover, many of them had been the *&apos;&apos; Territorials &apos;;&apos;of Civil Defence long before the war and volunteered for full-time service, and the case of the Army Territorials is one of the reasonsfor this Bill.(e) Their experience, moreover, compares well with that of the Army in thiscountry. Many have experienced clanger and hardship and willprobably do so again. There rate of fatal casualties is higherproportionately than that of, e.g., Anti Aircraft Command, and much higher in the aggregate. It is true that they are not required to serveabroad, but many of those to whom the Minister of Labour wishes toextend these rights, especially the women, will never leave these shores.(/) Many volunteer policemen and firemen will have to be retained during the transitional period after the German armistice, and the willing service which will be vitally necessary is not to be expected if they can look forward to no right of reinstatement in their pre-service civilianemployment when the time comes to discharge them. Their positionis in this respect like that of the other volunteers who may have to be- kept on for the Japanese war, and whose admittedly special case hasled the Minister of Labour to propose the extension of these rights tomany men and women who have no such special claim.(g) It has been argued that Civil Defence Volunteers will have a chance ofobtaining vacancies in the Police, Fire and Local Authority Services.In fact the number of suitable Local Authority jobs will be small,while police and fire vacancies will be relatively few, and here also the criterion of suitability will be important. It could be argued equally.well that, e.g., many soldiers will be kept on in the Army.(h) That is the position as it affects the men and women.  A consideration ofa different kind affects the Government and Local Authorities asemployers. Where the man or woman concerned has been employedonly for the purposes of the war, the obligations to reinstate should as far as possible rest upon the pre-service civilian employer, whereasunder the Bill it will rest in the case of a civil defence volunteer whosubsequently joins the Forces either upon the local authority or, byanalogy, upon &apos; the Government. There will, no doubt,, be cases in industry where the wartime employer is inevitably saddled with theobligation, but where, as in the case of these Services, the obligationcan be referred back to the peace-time employer that, I suggest, oughtto be done.6. I am told that the Bill cannot now be altered because it has been agreed with both sides of industry and that the employers&apos; side would not agree to theextension. So far as I know, the point was never put to them and, quite possibly,like most of the Press and, I believe, at one stage the Treasury, they did not realise that the Bill did not cover Civil Defence Volunteers. Because of the reference in the long title to a civil defence &apos;&apos; force &apos;&apos; I understand that the dummy wouldhave to be withdrawn and the Bill (which has not yet been published) presentedagain, but that offers no difficulty.7. I do not believe that the extension which I propose would provoke a claim for employees in industry. Everyone realises that that would make these rights valueless. Further, civil defence conscripts have had them since 1941without any such repercussion. Moreover, the inclusion of the eleven women&apos;services set out in the First Schedule is much more likely to provoke other claims : on behalf, for instance, of the Women&apos;s Land Army. In particular I donot consider that the inclusion of the Civil Defence along with the Armed andWomen&apos;s Services will have any effect upon the claim which will no doubt bemade in any case on behalf of the young men now being sent to coal mining.8. The question whether Civil Defence is to be treated like a service or an industrial occupation is cropping up in many connections. Sometimes we have placed Civil Defence on one side of the borderline, sometimes on the other. the considerations involved are not always exactly the same and no particular decisionneed create a precedent. In the present instance, however, and in general, I seegrave objection to excluding these people, who served us so bravely in the blitz
9 and who deserve well of the country, from such benefit as reinstatement rightsmay confer. I do not think that any question would have arisen if the experiencesof 1940-41 had been closer to us, nor do I consider that we have any right to legislate on the assumption that further ordeals do not await these fine people.I expect Parliamentary pressure and. public resentment when the facts arerealised, as I do not believe they are at present, and we are in danger of doingserious damage, to the morale both of these Services and of the public at the verytime when its maintenance at a high level is important.9. I hope, therefore, that the War Cabinet will decide to avoid a courseof action which I regard as both inexpedient and unjust.H M.Home Office, S.W.1,Qth January, 1944.
