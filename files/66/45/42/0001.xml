this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1944.SECRET./Copy No.W.P. (44) 42.25th January, 1944.WAR cabinet government BUILDING PROGRAMME, JANUARY TO JUNE 1944.I HAVE received and considered the programmes and labour demands ofthe Service and Supply and Civil Departments for the first six months of thisyear. The total labour available in this period is shown in Table A, and theindividual allocations and figures of labour actually employed in November and december 1943 are given in Table B. Table C shows the Departments&apos; demands,and in Table D I give my proposed allocations for January to June 1944.2. The Air Ministry programme has been very drastically reduced sincethe first draft was put forward, and now involves new works costing  19 millions(apart from small works under  5,000 for which Commands are responsible).The Ministry of Supply new demands include 16,900 men for &quot; Phoenix.&quot; this demand has not hitherto been given a specific allocation, but has been dealt withas indicated in the discussion at the War Cabinet at its meeting on the18th October (W.M. (43) 142nd Conclusions, Minute 7). Upwards of 2,600 menare being provided from outside the building industry, partly by the Admiraltytransferring carpenters from shipbuilding and partly by temporary release fromthe Army. The proposed allocation of 14,000 for &quot; Phoenix &quot; covers the balanceof requirements according to the programme as now revised. There is a newdemand by the Ministry of Fuel and Power for the provision of hostels for themen recruited into the mining industry by ballot. Otherwise there are nonoteworthy changes in. the character of programmes. All long-term proposals are being critically scrutinised.3. I consider that it is necessary to make some special provision to enable the repair of war damage and, in particular, housing repairs to be accelerated, and afurther step to be taken in regard to new housing. Owing to other overridingdemands, it is not possible to do much before the beginning of April, and the initial allocations are small. But after discussion with the Health DepartmentsI am satisfied that even these comparatively small allocations should have a material effect. I propose a special allocation rising by the end of June to 22,000for England and Wales and 7,000 for Scotland, for the purposes indicated above as well as to cover the advance preparation of housing sites.4. This figure will, I hope, be increased after the 1st July, 1944, if theMinistry of Labour find it practicable to carry out the suggestion made at the demobilisation Committee that some transfers of craftsmen back to the buildingindustry might be possible after that date. The arrangement by which housinghas been given a general priority over any building not included in the govern-ment building programme will remain.5. I propose to take stock of the situation in three months&apos; time. It maybe that the pressure of events and the continued application of the principleof &quot; maximum impact in 1944,&quot; coupled, with the effect of the Cabinet man-power,allocations, may mean that fewer new projects come forward and even that someof those already allowed for are cancelled. We may even be able, in consequence,to accelerate some of the accepted projects, but since the next few months will almost certainly bring emergency demands the nature of which we cannot nowforesee, it would be unwise to assume now that essential demands will fall belowthe proposed allocations at least for the first three months of the year.Memorandum by the Minister of -Production.O.
