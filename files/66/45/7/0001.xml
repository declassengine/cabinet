Printed for the War Cabinet, January, 1944MOST secret copy NoW.P. (44) 7yth January, 1944.The circulation of this   paper  has been strictly   limited.    It   is   issued   for   the personal use ofWAR CABINETTHE ACCREDITING OF &quot; DAILY WORKER&quot; WARCORRESPONDENTS TO BRITISH forces memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI. procedure by which War Correspondents are accredited..&apos;;fl A.limited number of war correspondents, dependent upon the circumstances of the campaign, are accredited to a field force.   These may be nominated by : &apos; (i) Press Agencies ;. (ii) National Daily Newspapers ;(hi) Provincial Daily Newspapers.Those Agencies and Newspapers allotted vacancies by the Newspaper and PeriodicalEmergency Council submit the names of their nominees to the War Office, and these, ifconsidered acceptable by the Security Service, are accredited to the force in question.2. &quot;Daily Worker&quot; applications.Between April and July, 1943, the Editor of the &quot; Daily Worker &quot; has put forwardffhrough the Newspaper artd Periodical Emergency Council the names of four correspondents:for accrediting to North Africa and the Field Army at home. All of these have been rejected by the Security Service as being personally unfitted for appointments as War Correspondents,-it having been decided in May that names put forward by the &quot; Daily Worker &quot; should beconsidered individually rather than that the &quot; Daily Worker &quot; should be informed that nonominee of the paper would be regarded as acceptable.zox: -The Editor has repeatedly applied for aft interview to discuss &quot;What further steps could be taken by him to nominate correspondents acceptable to the War Office &quot;, but so faran interview has not been given to him. He published a leading article on the subject in theissue of 5th January, 1944.The Editor has now again asked for an interview as he desires to appoint a correspon-dent for the European campaign.3. Present practice and future intentions.Accredited correspondents are entitled to treatment as officers and to expect military information and facilities not available to other members of the Press or of the public. it follows that they must often be in possession of important military information eitherimparted in confidence or gathered from their daily contact with the forces to which theyare accredited.In theatres overseas the danger of leakage of such information, whether due to deliberatebreach of trust or to indiscretion, may to a large extent be offset by the existence of cable-head censorship. At home there is not the same close control of what is furnished to the papers by these correspondents; and further, in the forthcoming European campaign, it isthe present intention that the Press should be kept informed of the progress of operationsbased on this country by periodical background conferences held at the Headquarters of theSupreme Allied Command in London, and from which it would hardly be practicable to exclude a particular newspaper correspondent. That being so, accredited correspondentswill be in daily touch with their newspaper offices, and the power of the Censorship to localiseleakages of information will be greatly reduced.
4, Attitude of other Government Departments towards the &quot; Daily Worker &quot;.The Ministry of Information accord the &quot; Daily Worker &quot; the same treatment in thiscountry as any other daily newspaper, except that no representative of the paper has ever been invited to one of the Ministers background conferences. In all other respects theMinistry accord equal treatment to this newspaper and would not support any proposal todo otherwise.The Foreign Office are prepared to accept &quot; Daily Worker &quot; political corres-coorespondents overseas, provided there is nothing of a specially adverse character knownagainst the individuals selected.The Home Office agree that, with many members of the Party, zeal for what they believe to be the interests of the Party is stronger than loyalty to this country. Butthey are in some doubt as to whether sufficient grounds exist to justify differentiatingthe &quot; Daily Worker &quot; from other newspapers.5. War Office view.The management of the &quot; Daily Worker &quot; is known to be in close association withthe Headquarters of the British Communist Party whose members, there is every reasonto believe, place Party interests above loyalty to the country. After the recentSpringhali case there can be little doubt that this view is well founded.In the view of the War Office and of the Security Service no nominee put forward by the &quot; Daily Worker &quot; will be acceptable. This is so not merely because suchnominees are certain to have Communist sympathies, but because the paper itself hassuch sympathies, and because information imparted by an accredited correspondent tothe &quot; Daily Worker &quot; is certain to become common knowledge among members of theCommunist Party or its leaders. The considerable section of the community which lieson the fringe of the Communist Party is likely, therefore, to become acquainted withthis information, and the danger of its leakage to the enemy, whether through Eire orother media, is real. It is not a question of information being given to Russia thatma3&apos; or may not be desirable it is solely a question of the danger of leakage of infor-mation to the enemy which may affect operations and cost the lives of British soldiers.It is certain that accredited correspondents in this country will obtain knowledge of plans and counter-plans which, if imparted to the enemy, might endanger their success.In the War Office view, therefore, the &quot; Daily Worker &quot; should not be permitted to have accredited correspondents.6. Recommendation.In these circumstances, I feel that as Secretary of State for War responsible forthe security of operations in which the British Army will be involved I cannot acceptthe risk, however slight it may be represented to be, of permitting the &quot; Daily Worker &quot;to accredit a war correspondent to the forces which are to be engaged in Europe. I amaware that a decision of this nature will be regarded in many quarters as an attack upon the freedom of the Press and that it will involve a frank avowal by the Govern-ment of its attitude towards this organ. My recommendation, nevertheless, is that the&quot; Daily Worker &quot; should now be told that in no circumstances will they be permitted to accredit correspondents to the forces for this or for any other operation. I ask mycolleagues&apos; support for this view and I ask authority to act immediately in accordancewith it.P. J. G.The War Office,yth January, 1944.(b43/18)   60   1/44   w.o.p.   16280
