this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.ICopy No.WAR CABINET.POLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith the record of a conversation betweenthe Prime Minister and the Polish Ministers on the 20th January.A. E.Foreign Office, 23rd January, 1944.The Polish Prime Minister, M. Mikolajczyk, accompanied by the ForeignMinister, M. Romer, and the Ambassador, Count Raczynski, were this morningreceived by the Prime Minister, accompanied by Mr. Eden. Sir alexander cadogan was also present.The Prime Minister said that he understood that the Foreign Secretary hadalready made the Polish Government aware of his views on the Polish-Sovietproblem.He wanted to ask the Polish Government to accept in principle the Russianproposal regarding the Curzon Line, it being clearly understood that that would leave Lemberg in Russia, and to take the compensation offered them in east prussia, Danzig, Pomerania, up to the Oder line and in Upper Silesia. ThePrime Minister asked the Polish Government not only to accept this in principlebut with enthusiasm. He quite understood that that would be particularly hardfor them, but, as a friend of their country, he was convinced that this was thebest that they could hope to obtain. Personally, he thought it offered a fairsolution. Poland would obtain valuable territory in exchange for a regionincluding the Pripet Marshes, which could be of little value to them. It wouldcast on Poland the responsibility of rendering great service to the future ofEurope : they would be the guardians of Europe against Germany on the eastand that would ensure a friendly Russia. Moreover, the territory which theywould then possess would enable Poland to live as a strong and independent state.If it were said that the Polish move to the west would bring them in conflict with Germany, his answer would be that the United Nations would see to it thatall unwanted Germans would be removed from the territory transferred to poland, and that Germany herself would be disarmed and mutilated to an extent that would render it impossible for her to commit any further aggression againstPoland. It was unthinkable that this country should go to war with theSoviet Union over the Polish eastern frontier, and the United States wouldcertainly never do so. After all, we never entered the war for the easternfrontiers of Poland, and it was useless to imagine that we could embark on a conflict with Russia on that issue. The Prime Minister said that he made theseremarks to the Polish Prime Minister in private conversations, but he added thathe would not hesitate if necessary to repeat them in public.M. Mikolajczyk said that the Polish Government by their last declarationhad meant to make it plain that they regarded the question of frontiers as open for discussion.SECRET.W.P. (44) 48.23rd January, 1944.12256   [26775]
The Prime Minister admitted this, and observed that the subsequent Sovietrejoinder was of a harsh nature.M. Mikolajczyk said that the problem was very difficult, not only from a legal point of view, but also from a practical point of view : the territorialquestions must be reserved for decision by the Polish people. However, thePolish Government had already declared their readiness to discuss frontierquestions, and they did not stand pat on the Riga Line. On the other hand,from their point of view, the question must resolve itself into a revision of theRiga Treaty which was the only valid instrument governing Polish frontiers.They must, therefore, take that Treaty as the starting-point.The settlement contemplated was of a most radical nature, and could onlybe accepted with great difficulty by the Polish nation. That difficulty might belessened if the future of Poland were assured by political and other guarantees.The Prime Minister readily recognised the force of this. He said he couldonly speak for His Majesty&apos;s Government, and did not know what would be theview of the United States Government. But in his view if a settlement could bereached it should be agreed by the three Great Powers and defended by them.M. Mikolajczyk said that if they were to agree that the basis for the negotiation was to be the Curzon Line, that would be of very great advantage to the Soviet. The Soviet were not in need of territory and they had indeedbased their claim rather on a principle of nationality. If the question were tobe judged by that standard, the Polish case would be much easier to defend.The Prime Minister explained that these frontier changes would certainly .involve large transfers of population, but he was bound to say that he thought they afforded the best hope to Poland. After generations of servitude Polandhad been given her freedom at the end of the last war. Now she had again beenbrutally, overrun, but he felt that there was a chance now of setting up anindependent Poland in a compact territory with an ample seaboard. It wouldnot be necessary for the Polish frontier to be pushed farther west towards theOder than the Poles desired, but on their western frontier the Poles would havethe high duty of standing guard against future German aggression with theguarantee of the three Great Powers. It must be remembered that the russians had certain rights in the matter, having lost in this war and the last perhaps as many as 20 million men. Britain alone could never have restored Poland to independence. It was the Russian army that had made possible the rebuilding of a strong and independent Poland We felt we had the right to ask of Polandthis great service of defending Europe against German eastward expansion; thatwas the way in which the Polish Government should put it to their people, ratherthan representing it clS cl surrender.M. Mikolajczyk again reverted to his argument that if the Soviet claims were based on nationality they should not lay claim to the Curzon Line, whichwould leave 4 million Poles on the Russian side of it. The problem had not been treated from the nationality angle which was regrettable. That would have givenscope for negotiations.The Prime Minister said that in his view there was not much room for negotiation; if Poland received the Curzon Line on the one hand and com-pensation in the north and west on the other, it would be a good escape from thepresent dilemma. What, after ail, was the alternative? Under the present proposals it might well be that a Pole in Lemberg would have to be transferred toOppeln, and that no doubt might involve inconvenience and disturbances. Butthat would surely be better for him than to wait while the Russian army rolledon and leave his ultimate fate to the decision of the Soviet Government. It wouldbe much better to transfer Poland westward, as it were, even though that meantencroachment on what was now German territory. The Great Powers would seeto it that Germany after the war would be in no position to take revenge on herneighbour.M. Mikoldjczyk said that he quite realised the strength of the PrimeMinisters arguments, but he must emphasise another point, which was that theproposals under consideration would expose Poland to very serious real losses in the shape of mines, oilfields, agricultural land, &amp;c. His position would beimpossible unless he could tell the Polish nation that Poland would emerge fromthe war undiminislied. The greater the upheaval involved by these proposals,the greater would be the unfriendly reaction all over the world.&apos;  For instance, he
had noted recently that certain organs of the Press had begun to use the argument that it would be unjust to transfer East Prussia to Poland. He was afraid that poland, whilst losing in the east, might not receive her due compensation inthe west.The Prime Minister said that, of course, the two things were linked together,and if the compensation in the west were not received Poland would no longer be bound by her agreement on the east.The Prime Minister said that what he proposed to do was to send a i telegram to Marshal Stalin informing- the latter of what he had just said to thePolish Prime Minister, and telling him that that would be the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government at any Peace Conference. He hoped that M. Mikolajczykmight enable him to say that he (M. Mikolajczyk) was willing to discuss inprinciple on the basis of the Curzon Line on the understanding that Poland would receive compensation in the west. The Prime Minister would in that eventprotest strongly against the Soviet tendency to call in question the authority ofthe Polish Government recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The attemptto undermine another Government was inadmissible. One or more members ofthe Polish Government might not be to the Soviet liking, but no Government hadthe right to dictate to another concerning its composition. That was the PrimeMinisters point of view and he would put it to Marshal Stalin.If a settlement could not be reached Poland would be exposed to Russianwrath, and it must be remembered that Russia had lost 7 to 8 million men in thepresent war against Germany.If negotiations on these lines could be opened, he hoped diplomatic relationsmight be resumed. M. Mikolajczyk would have to take the risk and incur theodium of saying to his people that he thought this was the right course.M. Mikolajczyk said he would have a meeting of his Government in the afternoon and would report the result to the Prime Minister. He fully realised,of course, that Poland could not count on the Allies going to war to defendPoland&apos;s eastern frontier, but he observed that the case of Poland was a test case for the solution of many other questions.The Prime Minister said that his idea had been that these questions were better reserved for settlement at the Peace Conference. But -it must beremembered that the Russian armies were pressing forward, and if nothing was done it was difficult to know what situation might face us. If, on the other hand,an agreement could be reached now the situation could be held.M. Mikolajczyk said he fully realised all this, but he had to state his owndifficulties. He was ready to accept the fact that a change of frontier was inevitable, but he wished to start the negotiation on the basis of the Riga Line.There were two great difficulties in the cession of Vilna and Lvov.The Prime Minister said that as regards Vilna His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad opposed its award to Poland at the last peace settlement, and that as regardsLvov, though that might be a Polish city, it must be admitted that the surrounding country was not predominantly Polish. And it must be rememberedthat under these proposals Poland would receive as compensation in East PrussiaDanzig, Silesia and Oppeln.M. Mikolajczyk then referred to the Soviet Governments apparent desire tointerfere in Polish internal affairs. From this he deduced that the Soviet reallywished to incorporate Poland in the Soviet Union.The Prime Minister observed that that would be an argument for reaching a settlement now : if the matter were delayed that might be indeed the ultimateresult, and he reminded M. Mikolajczyk that he had already said that he wouldpress Marshal Stalin on this point of dealing with the Polish Government inLondon.M. Mikolajczyk asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would help themby urging that the negotiations should not be based at the start on theCurzon Line.The Prime Minister said that in his view the negotiations would have to start on the Curzon Line subject to ethnographic questions being fully and fairlyconsidered. He was most anxious to find a means of affording a suitableliving-space for the Polish population.
M. Mikolajczyk asked whether anything could be done to promote agreement regarding Soviet co-operation with the Polish underground movement.The Prime Minister replied that he would certainly also urge this onMarshal Stalin, and he also promised to do what might be possible to supply arms to the movement. He would wait to hear from M. Mikolajczyk the result of hisconsultation this afternoon with his Government, and he would then showM. Mikolajczyk the message which he proposed to send to Marshal Stalin.Recapitulating, the Prime Minister said that his message,to Marshal Stalinwould deal with four points : (1) the British point of view, (2) what the PolishGovernment were ready to accept, (3) non-interference in the internal affairs of another Government, (4) a speedy understanding concerning underground actionin Poland.The Prime Minister said that all these matters must be dealt with veryurgently; if not, we might be overtaken by events which would be difficult to remedy. He hoped M. Mikolajczyk would give him as full a contribution aspossible which he could use in his telegram to Marshal Stalin. He fully under-stood that this would be difficult, but he hoped that in this critical momentM. Mikolajczyk would be equal to the occasion.20th January, 1944.
