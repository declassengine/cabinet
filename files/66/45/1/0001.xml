THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET      . -      COPY NO.il/;w.p. (hh) l.3rd January,19^4-WAR CABINETJute supplies memorandum by the Minister of Production.I feel I must call the attention of my colleagues to thelong term position of jute supplies.    This important material is grown wholly in India,  and within India a high proportioncomes from the province of Bengal where it is a competitive cropwith rice.    Jute goods have a wide variety of uses under war conditions,  the principal being sacks for the carriage.of food,fertilisers and other commodities.2.      The Government of. India and the Government of Bengal will,shortly have to decide the level of the crop to be planted in the ..spring of 19kh which has to cover requirements for the jute year,July 19^/June&apos; 19U5.    The present view of the Government of india is that the same acreage should be licensed for planting in bengal in 19kk as in 19^-3*  which if fully planted and returningan&apos;average crop would, with the amounts planted in other provinces which do not vary substantially from year to year&apos;,  give an&apos;. estimated crop-of 8,5 million bales.3.      This estimated yield falls short of the estimated juterequirements for the United Nations for 19hh/h5, which on a conservative basis (and making no allowance for the reinstitutionof civilian uses abandoned under war conditions) are put at 10.5 million bales.    This estimate includes an allowance of 1.3 millionbales for liberated&apos; territories in Europe and 0.6 million balesagainst the liberation of Burma and Malaya.U.      The crop for the current year of 7 million bales is in-sufficient to meet requirements and the deficit is being made up from stocks which it is estimated will amount to about 3 millionbales at the end of June 19hk plus an amount of jute goodsadmittedly only sufficient for normal working requirements.    TheGovernment of India suggest that  the difference between-estimated requirements and probable production in 19UU/us should be bridgedby reducing the carry over at the end of 19U5.to 1 million bales.This does not appear to be a practicable solution as my advice isthat Indian mill stocks cannot be reduced below 2-2-g- months&apos;working, stock (l.h million bales) and in addition there must always be a considerable amount of jute in transit in balers&apos;hands and up country.    It is, doubtful therefore whether the.stocks in India could provide more than 0.5 million bales towardsthe deficit in 19hh/^5 without serious dislocation of normaltrading.The attention of the U.S.A.-  (who are responsible for require-ments  in the Western Hemisphere) and of the Empire has been called to the probable position in India in 19M+/us and they havebeen urged to institute where practicable further measures of economy and substitution.    In particular the U.S.A. have beenasked to examine how far it would be possible to.substitutecotton for jute.    Plans to this end were laid in that country atthe time when the position in .the Bay of Bengal was serious, but.at this stage a changeover might have unfortunate repercussions.-/on   ji
on textile goods in other directions.6.      As I have mentioned above jute and rice are interchangeablecrops competing for the same land and labour so that any increasein jute plantings must be at the expense of rice.    The Governmentof India take the view, which is strongly supported by theSecretary of State for India and with which I agree,  that inpresent food conditions any substantial reduction in the area   ,.,planted with rice would be economically and politically inexperienced-     vpedient, and although I fully appreciate&apos; the desire of my     -  i J:colleagues,  the Minister of Supply and the Minister of Pood,  to &apos;see their requirements fully covered, I do not think we can press the Government of India to press in their turn the Government of bengal to license a larger acreage than was licensed in ISk^/hk,Although the Government of Bengal are apparently able to ensurethat the licensed acreage is not exceeded, there is no method bywhich they can ensure that it is actually planted,    In lSh3/kkthe area actually planted was considerably short of the licensedacreage and I feel that the best plan is to.consider with theGovernment of India the inducements necessary to ensure.&quot;that the acreage licensed is actually planted.(D.L.Great George Street,S.W.I.3rd January,  19M-h
