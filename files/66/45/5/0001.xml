Six German U-boats were sunk, two possibly sunk and onedamaged.Enemy Intelligence.17. The morale of survivors from the Sckarnhorst has been found on examination to be excellent.It is reported that some naval establishments have been transferred fromKiel to Jutland as a result of air raids.U-boats.18. A large group of U-boats is operating in mid-Atlantic north-west ofIreland (R), and a smaller concentration is reported west of Cape Finisterre.In the Indian Ocean Japanese U-boats are operating in the entrance of theGulf of Oman, in the Gulf of Aden, off Bombay and between the coast ofS.W.

Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked three ships, oneof which is known to have sunk. A straggler from an outward-bound convoy was sunk south of Iceland (C) after having been torpedoed twice. This is the first time since the end of October that a ship has been torpedoed in the N.W.Approaches. A tanker on passage to Abadan was torpedoed in the Gulf ofOman but. reached port, and a U.S. ship was torpedoed and abandoned north-west of Bermuda.The s.s. Largs Bay (14,182 tons) was mined in the Bay of Naples andsubsequently beached. Three ships in an eastbound coastal convoy were sunk byE-boats off the Lizard.20.

Aircraft laid mines off the Dutch coast, off the&apos; north coast of Franceand the Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.23.&quot; There haAre been no reports of minelaying by either aircraft or surface craft during the week.The clearance of around mines in the Portsmouth Eastern Approaches waso JL .1.completed on the 31st.The mine totals are : 4,6.15 ground and 3,934 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.24. Photographs recently taken of the blockade-runner Osomo (6,951 tons),which has arrived from the Far East and which is aground at Le Verdon, show the importance which the enemy attaches to her cargo. Three escort vessels,four minesweepers and a sperrbrecher have been stationed to seaward of her,and for her further protection three heavy railway anti-aircraft guns and somelight guns have arrived on the railway sidings.A number of Finnish ships recently employed by the Germans along theNorwegian coast have been recalled by the Finns on the expiration of theircharters.Two German motor lighters, laden with coal, were expected to leave theDardanelles en route for Salonika on the 5th. Two similar barges were expectedto follow.   A convoy of cargo ships from the Piraeus reached Leros on the 1st.Spanish Intelligence.25. On the 29th December two bombs exploded on the hull of the Italians.s. Lavoro (7,886 tons) at Cartagena, and on the 31st, two bombs exploded inthe British s.s. Harlesden (7,273 tons) at Valencia. On the 1st and 2nd Januarysimilar, though ineffective, explosions occurred in the cargo of two British ships which had joined a homebound convoy from Gibraltar.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-Cerman Campaign.(An outline map is included as an inset.)Revel-Vitebsk Sector.26. The Russians have made some progress west of Velikie Luki and north of Nevei.   South of Vitebsk they have cut the road Vitebsk-Orsha, which runs
just east of the railway. They are therefore closing in on Vitebsk from threesides. The Germans claim to have repulsed strong local attacks by the Russianson the 2nd january^ in this area.Kiev Sector.27. The Russian offensive in this sector has continued to make excellentprogress both westwards and south-westwards. In their thrust westwards theycaptured Korosten on the 29th December and Zhitomir two days later, and their advance has now continued beyond Novograd Volynsk. The south-westerlythrust, which resulted in the capture of Kazatin on the 30th December, appearsto be directed towards Zhmerinka. The capture of this place would cut the mainrail communications from Germany to the Southern Dnieper and would be a grave threat to all the German forces in the Dnieper Bend. The Germans aretherefore likely to make every effort to prevent the Russians from reachingZhmerinka. Further east the Russians on the 4th January captured ByelayaTserkov, 20 miles S.S.E. of Fastov.Dnieper Bend.28. The Russians have made some progress west of Zaporozhe and have continued their attacks against the Nikopol bridgehead, but with no positionalchange.Italy.29. Weather conditions over the battle front have become even more severeduring the past week. On the Adriatic coast gales and storms have been raging.Farther inland heavy falls of snow and intense cold have slowed up operations and made the maintenance of forward troops a matter of considerable difficulty.Eighth Army.30. On the Adriatic coast sector Canadian troops are holding. positionssome 2 miles N.W. of Ortona, having fought off one or two heavy counter-attacks.To their immediate south an Indian division has made a little progress towardsTollo.In the Orsona area the Germans still hold a strong defensive position; here and over the whole coastal sector they are fighting stubborn defensive actions and only falling back under the strongest pressure.Fifth Army.31. French and U.S. forces have made slow progress in the mountainstowards Mt. Mare, Acquafondata and S. Vittore. Strong U.S. fighting patrolshave been probing the enemy defences outside S. Vittore. By the 5th Januaryone company was fighting in the town with another attacking from the south.Progress is slow, with the enemy putting up strong defensive fire from manyhouses that they have converted into pillboxes.There has been renewed activity along the R. Garigliano. On the night ofthe 29th/30th December a Commando made an assault landing beyond the mouth of the river and destroyed a bridge on the coastal road. They were supported byone of our infantry brigades, which attacked across the river towards the samebridge and effectively engaged enemy positions.Further local attacks have taken place along the river in the areas to theS.E. of Castelforte and San Ambrogio.Yugoslavia.32. Macedonian Partisans have clashed with Bulgarian frontier troops;some of those captured joined the Partisans.The fighting round Livno has died down, and the Germans appear to have abandoned the effort to penetrate further north into Partisan-held territory.The Germans have captured Ml jet Island and further operations against the islands off the Dalmatian coast are probable.In the area east of Fiume the Partisans have captured points on the mainFiume-Zagreb railway, thus linking the Partisan areas of Slovenia with thoseof Croatia.In the Slovenian towns of Kocevje and Novo Mesto the German garrisonsare cut off by the Partisan forces. Further east, in Central Bosnia, a Partisanraiding force has penetrated into the important town of Banjaluka.The Partisans have continued sabotage against Axis-controlled railway lines.[26683] .3 2

E.L.A.S. forces have been engaged in heavy fighting against theGermans in Macedonia and in the Olympus area, and sabotage to German L. of C,has been resumed in this region.New Guinea.34. The Australians, in their advance along the coast north of Finschhafen,have reached a point about 35 miles N.W. of the town.On the 2nd January, U.S. troops landed without opposition at Saidor, on thenorth coast of New Guinea, thus cutting off from their main base at Madang a japanese force estimated at about 4,000.In the Eamu Valley Australian troops have captured a commanding hillfeature some 40 miles south of Madang.New Britain.35.   The  U.S.  forces which  landed  at  Cape  Gloucester  had  by the30th December captured the airfields and enlarged their beach-heads.At Arawe there has been patrol activity only.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. U.S. heavy bombers attacked Ludwigshafen, Kiel and Munster andtargets in France.Bomber Command operated in strength against Berlin (twice) and Stettin.A heavy scale of attack was maintained against military objectives inNorthern France.In Italy, railway centres were bombed; fighter-bombers provided support forthe Army in the battle area.In operations over New Britain, 83 enemy aircraft were destroyed.United Kingdom.37. In daylight no enemy aircraft were reported over this country. on three nights a total of 43 enemy aircraft operated over the Home and South-Eastern Counties, and 10 of these penetrated to the London area. Six enemy aircraft were shot down, including one by AA. fire.Home Waters.38. The only attack on enemy shipping was made by escorted R.P. Typhoonswhich damaged a ship off Boulogne.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 100 were despatched, laid 308 sea-mines in enemy waters.
In the attacks on the 5th, which were made in clear weather, photographs ofKiel show a concentrated area of fire west of Die Horn commercial port and otherbursts in the north-west and north-east sections of the city. At Merignac airfield,hangars were seen to be on fire and, at Tours, a concentration of bursts was observed in the hangar area to the south of the airfield.Two hundred and nine squadrons of fighters operated in conjunction withthe above attacks and these, together with the bombers, destroyed 158 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 53 and damaged 50; 63 Fortresses, 26 Liberatorsand 31 fighters are missing.Offensive^operations of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force, which were on a heavy scale and maintained throughout the week, were almost exclusively directed against military objectives in the coastal areas of Northern France. The 1,479aircraft, which attacked these targets, dropped 1,177 tons of bombs and fired 817rocket projectiles for the loss of seven aircraft. Escort and support were supplied by 121 squadrons of fighters which encountered negligible opposition; two enemy aircraft were destroyed and two Spitfires are missing.Two squadrons of Typhoons, on a sweep over Holland, destroyed, five Do. 217for the loss of one Typhoon. A further four enemy aircraft were destroyed by fighters in the Paris area.Night.40. Aircraft of Bomber Command operated in strength on three nights ofthe week, the main targets being Berlin (on the nights of the 1st/2nd and2nd/3rd) and Stettin (on the night of the 5th/6th).The two attacks on Berlin, which were made by 355 and 284 aircraft respectively, were both carried, out through thick cloud. The total tonnage of bombs dropped was 2,288 but no definite assessment of results is possible although,in the second attack which is believed to have extended from east to west, two areas of conflagration are reported.At Stettin, a fortunate break in the weather, about 30 miles short of thecity, resulted in the target being clearly visible and a concentrated attackdeveloped which merged into a very large area of fire. In this raid, the enemy fighters would appear to have been well deceived by an aerial flarepath laid,towards Berlin.From the three operations, which involved the despatch of 1,162 aircraft,70 bombers are missing and a further three crashed in this country.Subsidiary attacks by a total Of 95 Mosquitoes, of which one is missing, weremade upon a number of targets in Germany and a further 100 aircraft bombedmilitary objectives in Northern France.Italy.41. Attacks on enemy railway centres and communications were continued throughout the week. The targets bombed by Fortresses were Turin, Padua,Rimini, Ferrara and Ravenna. In these attacks, which were reported to be very successful, a total of 639 tons of bombs was dropped. Enemy opposition was ona small scale except during the raid on Turin when 20 enemy fighters were encountered, two of which were destroyed for the loss of seven Lightnings andone Fortress. Fifty-three Fortresses attacked Villaperosa Ball Bearing Works,causing extensive damage.Mitchells and Marauders bombed railway centres at Falconara (seven miles. of Ancona), term , Viareggio (13 miles W.N.W. of Lucca), and Borgo SanLorenzo (14 miles N.E. of Florence) and the quays and railway yards atCivitavecchia. Near San Remo, a number of hits were obtained on a bridge atTaggia, and at Ventimiglia two spans of the west bridge,and one end of theeast bridge were destroyed. Good results were also reported after attacks on railway bridges at Certaldo, Foligno and Orvieto (N.N.W. of Rome). Anothersuccessful raid by 24 Marauders was made on the Var river bridge in the southof France.Fighter-bombers and light-bombers were active in the rear of the enemy&apos;spositions; bridges, railway targets, roads, buildings and transport vehicles werefreely attacked. After two attacks on consecutive days on M.T. in the Popoli/Arezzano road and snow-bound M.T. in the mountain area, 57 vehicles were destroyed and nearly 200 damaged. Fighter-bombers also destroyed or damaged17 locomotives and a number of wagons. In the battle area, enemy defendedpositions and concentrations of heavy artillery were heavily attacked particularlyin the areas of Tollo (S. of Pescara) and Cassino.
In the course of all these operations 29 enemy aircraft were destroyed and39 Allied aircraft are missing. The enemy casualties include two shot downby A.A. guns in an abortive attack by 12 Ju. 88 in the Catania/Augusta area.Yugoslavia.42. Split was attacked by 36 bombers and hits were observed in the dock area, railway centre and on a medium-sized ship. Twenty-four Mitchells bombedZara and hit warehouses and detonated 75/100 mines. Attacks on a similar-scale were made also on Prijedor (105 miles N. of Split), on Sibenik (30 miles .W. of Split), on the railway centre at Brodac (55 miles W. of Belgrade) andon the barracks at Travnik (48 miles N.W. of Sarajevo). Four schooners were damaged off Korcula Island and a ship of 6,000 tons was attacked by Warhawksoff the Dalmatian Coast resulting in a large explosion and. was left on fire.Bulgaria.43. A large force of escorted Fortresses was despatched to attack Sofiabut was unable to do so as the target was obscured by cloud. Twenty-nine ofthese bombed the town and railway centre of Dupnitsa (32 miles S.S.W. ofSofia).Russia.44. Early in the week the Russian communique spoke of strong close supportby the G.A.F. in the Korosten area. There was no further mention of air activity in that area, but it is thought that so far as the &quot;weather and the stateof the airfields permitted, operations in close support of the Russian advance inthe Kiev sector were maintained.In the Vitebsk-Nevel area, despite bad weather the Russian Air Force were engaged-in effective attacks with strong forces of ground, attack and fighter aircraft on German front-line troops.Elsewhere on the front, operations continued to be hampered by bad weather and are at present on a very limited scale.Burma.45. An effective attack by escorted Mitchells on a bridge over the Mu river,30 miles west by south of Mandalay, resulted in the destruction of two spansand, later, another attack inflicted considerable damage on reconstruction workin progress.Oil installations and power stations at Yenangyaung and Thayetmyo were bombed by a total of 70 heavy and medium bombers.Night attacks on the railway yards at Rangoon and Prome were carriedout by Wellingtons and Liberators and, by day, similar targets at Monywa andAlon, in Central Burma, were bombed by Liberators and Mitchells.A total of 218 fighters and fighter-bombers made numerous harassing attacks on enemy positions, storage dumps and camps in the Kalemyo and Akyab areas and three attacks on similar objectives in the Taro area in the north.Raids on enemy transport resulted in damage to 140 small craft, 103 unitsof rolling stock and 11 locomotives.Apart from a fighter sweep over Chittagong, the only enemy activity reportedis an attack by 14 escorted bombers on small naval craft off St. Martin&apos;s Island(50 miles N.W. of Akyab). Spitfires, which intercepted, destroyed eight of theenemy and damaged others; one Spitfire force-landed.China.46.

A total of 53 Liberators made two raids on the railway centre atLampang in North Siam.
Pacific Zone.New Guinea.48. The Allied effort was directed mainly against gun positions, troop concentrations and barge bases in the coastal areas around Alexishafen, Madang.Bogadyim and Saidor, against which a total of about 650 sorties, by heavy and medium bombers, was flown. At Saidor, about 300 tons of bombs were droppedprior to and in support of landing operations which took place on the 1st. Asimilar tonnage was dropped on gun positions and the airfield at Alexishafen.New Britain.49. A total of 183 medium and light bombers made seven raids on enemy concentrations and gun positions in the Borgen Bay area, and Liberators andMitchells made a heavy attack on similar targets near Cape Gloucester, dropping182 tons of bombs.The waterfront and town of Rabaul were bombed by 19 escorted Liberators,and the nearby airfield at Lakunai by 15 escorted Liberators and 35 Beauforts.In these operations and by fighters sweeping the same area, 72 enemy aircraft were destroyed and a further 32 were probably destroyed; one Liberator and eightfighters are missing and two Liberators crashed.Enemy aircraft, of which 11 were destroyed, made six small-scale raids onour positions in the Arawa area.A Catalina damaged a destroyer off Cape Hoskins.New Ireland and the Admiralty Islands.50.

APPENDIX VII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Berlin. The following account was prepared by a first-hand observer whowas resident in the German capital between the 22nd November, when the first and heaviest-of the recent series of night attacks took place, and mid-December.It should be stressed that this observer is an informant of proved reliability withopportunities to become fully acquainted wdth the situation as it existedimmediately following the November and December attacks :  Raids of 22nd/23rd November and 23rd/24:th November.Main areas of concentration. The principal areas covered by the attacks ofthe 22nd/23rd and 23rd/24th November were west and south-west of Berlin.But on this occasion the bombed areas extended considerably further east and north, reaching the Alexander Platz in the east and the Wedding district inthe north.The effects of the first raid were tremendous, and it was difficult to believethat in such a short time so large an area could have been bombed in so effectivea way. The raid of the 23rd/24th November covered more or less the same area,but on this occasion the main concentration of bombs fell in the so-called &quot; oldwest&apos;&apos; of Berlin and covered an area running from the Wittenberg Platz to thePotsdamer Platz in the east and the Hansa area in the north. Since it isimpossible to differentiate between the buildings destroyed during the first and during the second raids, the aggregate results of the twro attacks are giventogether in the following paragraphs.Damage to railways. The following damage was done to railway stations,lines, &amp;c. : (a) The main railway line running from west to east through the centre ofthe city was seriously damaged first between the stations of Spandauand Westkreutz; then at the Tiergarten station where the railway linecrosses the Charlottenburg Chaussee; then at the Borse station, wherea long-distance train was blown to pieces and finally, at the AlexanderPlatz. At these- points, bombs fell on the railway line itself. Else-where many houses in the immediate vicinity of the railway line were damaged. An H.E. bomb struck the premises of the KonditoreiTelschow near the Zoo station, and all the houses to the left and rightof the railway line between the Charlottenburg&apos; station and the Borsestation were wrecked by H.E. bombs. Repairs to this line took five days, and the first Stadtbahn trains started running only at 0900 onthe 29th November. The signal system and permanent way had beenrepaired by then, but owing to the state of the ruined houses on either side of the line, traffic could proceed at only a snail&apos;s pace and had tobe constantly interrupted during the periods when the adjacent houses are being pulled down or blown up. Main line traffic on this line was still not functioning up to mid-December. During the first ten days after the raid of the 22nd/23rd November main line traffic to and fromthe east ran into the Schlesischer station, that to and from the westinto the. Potsdamer station and to and from the north-west to theWustermark station.(b) During the raid of the 23rd/24th November the South Ring Line waswrecked near the Wilmersdorf station at the point at which it crossesthe Kaiserallee.(c) The North Ring Line was wrecked between the Putlitzstrasse andWedding stations, but damage here was less serious and traffic was maintained on a one-track line basis.id) The Lehrter station sustained considerable external damage, but thetracks were not damaged and traffic to and from Nauen could thereforebe maintained.(e) Two of the main stations in Berlin the Schlesischer and Goerlitzerstations were not damaged at all and were kept working during the[26683] c
whole week of raids. A food catastrophe was only prevented by thefact that these two stations kept operating and took over the wholeof the unloading of food trains which was formerly carried out at theAlexander Platz.(N.B. This area was damaged in later attacks.)(/) The Borse station was completely burned out.Damage to public buildings. So many public buildings were destroyed or damaged during the two attacks that it is easier to list what survives than what has been destroyed.   The following are known to have suffered  (a) The Technical High School in Charlottenburg has been completely burnedout.(b) Walking westwards from the Technical High School along the BerlinerStrasse and the Bismarckstrasse, there is not a single building left asfar as the Charlottenburg Opera House, which has also been badly damaged.(c) The Broadcasting Station at the Adolf Hitler Platz has escaped damage,but all the huts round it have been burned out.(d) The Opera House and the University in the Unter Den Linden have been damaged.(e) The Deutsche Bank buildings, including the vaults, have been completelyburned out.(/) The Propaganda Ministry (the former U.S. Embassy) has its upperstoreys torn off.(g) Hitler&apos;s residence (the old Reichskanzlei) has a wedge like a slice of cakecut out of it.(A) The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has been damaged by blast on thegarden side and has been evacuated.(i) -The Air Ministry has suffered from fire, but the buildings in Wilhelm-strasse are still standing.(j) The Gestapo Building in the Albrechtstrasse has been damaged; it wasevidently hit by a H.E. bomb and then caught fire.

(the former Hotel Prinz Albrecht), including thecellars, has been burned out.(I) The Polizei-Prasidium (in the Alexander Platz) has been damaged by three HE. bombs  and  its Adress-Bureau  completely  destroyed.Section Two of the Polizei-Prasidium (a separate building near theBorse station, which deals with foreigners) has been burned down tothe cellars.General Damage. -The following list includes items of general damage caused in the two raids : (a) The military garages and wooden barracks on the Berliner Strasseopposite the Technical High School have been completely burned out and a large number of military cars, trucks and caterpillar lorrieswere destroyed.(b) As one walks eastwards from the Technical High School the damage on both sides of the Charlottenburger Chaussee is very heavy.(c) The whole of the Tiergarten between the Charlottenburger Chaussee, theLandwehr Canal and the Fasanerie Allee has been wiped out and treesand bushes torn up. The only buildings left standing here are theItalian and Japanese Embassies. The Tiergarten station has been completely destroyed.(d) On either side of the Landwehr Canal as far as the Potsdamer Bridgeonly three or four buildings have escaped total destruction. The rest,including Tirpitzuer 80 (H.Q. of the Abwehr) and the Naval H.Q.(formerly the Reichswehrministerium Building), have been completelyburned out.(e) South of the Landwehr Canal the zone of complete destruction extends tothe south over the lutzow Platz as far as the Kleiststrasse.(/) Particularly heavy damage has been caused in the Wittenberg Platz andround the Gedenkniskirche.   In the Augsburgerstrasse, for example,only two houses have been left standing.
(g) Another centre of complete destruction in the Bayerischer area stretchesfrom the Kaiserallee in the west up to the Golzstrasse in the east.Everything in this area has been destroyed.(h) In the north, the Hansa district is completely wiped out.(i) The Moabit area has also suffered badly.(j) The heaviest damage, however, has been caused in the Wedding district,where there is practioally nothing left.(k) Destruction has also been very heavy along a direct line running f rom theG-esundtbrunner to the Alexander Platz.   Here only isolated houseshave been left standing, and even these will probably have to be pulleddown.   One of the heaviest blows was the destruction of the food supply stores near Alexander Platz.(V) Among hotels, the Kaiserhof has been destroyed by blast.   The Bristol hasbeen burned out.   The Hotel Adlon, on the other hand, escapeddamage.(m) The Unter Den Linden has also sustained considerable damage, theMilitary Museum and the so-called Old Palace being completelywrecked.(n) The British and French Embassies were completely burned out and theAmerican Embassy was damaged by blast to such an extent that itwill have to be pulled down. The Russian Embassy has not been damaged.(o) It is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain the total number of buildingsdestroyed in western, south-western, northern and central Berlin, upto and including the Alexander Platz. Fifty-three per cent, ofinformant&apos;s personal, acquaintances have had their houses completelyburned out. Germans working in the A.RP. services declare that about two million people were bombed out of house and home during these two raids.Raid on 2Qth/27th November.Main areas of concentration. In the raid of the 26th/27th November the areabombed was the west of Siemenstadt, where two of the biggest factory shops were completely burned out, and the Tegel district.Damage. Points of damage include the following : :(a) The Rheinmetall-Borsig plant in Tegel has suffered very severe damage and up to mid-December civilian workmen have not been allowed intothe factory and all workers have been placed under military control.It is rumoured that this factory has been completely put out of action.(b) The Tegel Gasometer, the biggest in Berlin, has been completely burnedout.(c) The Altkett factory has sustained very considerable damage.    Bothassembly shops are completely destroyed and people living nearbyrelate that over 100 Tiger tanks (informant himself saw 12 lyingabout) were completely burned up. The plant has been ruined beyondrepair, and the remnants of the shops have been blown up.(d) The main weight of the attack on Tegel fell on the former General Motorsplant, of which absolutely nothing is left. It is rumoured that thisparticularly concentrated attack was caused by the fact that about100 big guns arriving at the factory for repairs were still on the rail-way trucks and were probably taken for A/A guns.Raid of 3rd/4:th December.Main areas of concentration. Damage was hot concentrated in any specialareas as a result of this raid, which was more of an &apos;&apos; all over the place &apos;&apos; attackthan its predecessors.Damage.-^-Th.e damage caused, includes the following : (a) The Steglitz railway station has been buimed out.(b) A heavy H.E. bomb fell in the Alexander Platz.(c) Some damage was caused in Siemensstadt.(d) A large number of incendiary bombs fell on houses which had alreadybeen burned, out, in Grunewald and along the Hohenzollern Damm,for instance, where they caused no damage.
Frankfurt. In the attack on the 20th/21st December severe damage was caused in the districts of Eockenheim and Sachsenhausen, the suburb of Offenbachand in the centre of the city between the Opera House and the main Post office in the North and the river in the South. In Bockenheim the railway station and tramway depot were among the buildings affected. Along the Bocken-heim Land Strasse (the main exit from the centre of the city N.W.) for aconsiderable distance from the Opera House, over three-fourths of the buildings were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable. Most of the large warehouses inthe west harbour were burnt out and it was said that as much as four-fifths ofthe Sachsenhausen district were destroyed.Innsbruck. Two attacks were made by aircraft based in the Mediter-ranean theatre on the 15th and 19th December. In the first, severe damage was caused to the goods yards, where some 15 trains loaded with war material waiting to leave for Italy were wrecked. On the 19th December direct hits on the main station killed the station-master and many railway officials. The most important feature was, however, the rendering useless of 20 of the main line electriclocomotives used on the Brenner route, and the destruction of the railwayadministrative offices.The recent bombing of Innsbruck and the Brenner railway has created such difficulties that the Germans have been compelled to send a large number of motor transport in the area to maintain the flow of traffic.France.Paris.-Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 31st Decembershow damage to targets in the Bois Colombes area.(a) The Hispano-Suiza Aero Engine Works has suffered severely, and manyof the buildings which were damaged in the attack on the 15th.-September, and subsequently repaired, have again been hit.
