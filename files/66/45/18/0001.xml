THIS DOCUMENT IS TH^, PROPERTY OF HIS Bi.IT/iNNIG MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET. Copy No. oW.P. (44) 18.10th January, 1944.WAR CABINET.INDIA.Proposed Suspension of the Bengal Ministry and Assumption of powers by the Governor under Section 93 of the Government of India Act.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I append copies of telegrams exchanged with the Viceroy in the last threeweeks regarding his view that the Bengal situation can only be safeguarded andthe danger of a recurrence of famine avoided if the Ministry is got rid of and government by the Governor by proclamation under Section 93 established.In my telegram of the 24th December reference is made to a previousexchange of telegrams with Lord Linlithgow in September. He warned me, ina telegram of the 4th September, which was circulated to my colleagues, that inview of the weakness and incompetence displayed by the same Bengal ministry in handling the food problem and in dealing with the failures of the CalcuttaCorporation, it would very probably be necessary to apply Section 93. I enquiredby what processes it was contemplated to bring about the resignation of the ministry or, alternatively, on what grounds to dismiss a Ministry which commanded amajority and presumably the confidence of the Legislature; and suggested thatas the food problem was an all-India problem the appropriate course would bethat the Central Government should fully and constantly use it powers underSection 126a to issue directions to the Provincial Governments; these, or the constant exercise by the Governor of his sp&apos;ieial power to secure compliance withthe Governor-General&apos;s directions, might l^ad to resignation of the Ministry, whilerefusal to comply would furnish clear ground for dismissal.. Lord Linlithgowconcurred generally, though indicating that in his view the more likely develop-ments would be, either such resentment by the Ministers of such constant invasion of the Provincial field by the Central Governments that they would resign, or that Sir Nazimuddin would lose his supporters and so fail to command a majority in the Legislature and have to resign. In the event, owing largely to the impending demission of Office by Lord Linlithgow and the interval required fora new Governor-General to take stock of the position, the situation did not sodevelop.Now, three months later, Lord Wavell has again raised the problem, which,in essence, is whether to throw overboard regard for Provincial autonomy and get rid&apos; by dismissal of a Ministry which has a working majority, in orderthat the Governor may be free to take effective measures for the avoidance of a repetition of a partly man-made famine which cost possibly 1 million lives abovethe normal annual death-roll, or so to act within the principles of the constitutionthat the Ministry will either take, under pressure, measures that may proveadequate, or be driven by that pressure into resignation.Lord Wavell&apos;s view is clear that, by whatever means, the responsibility for control of the food situation in Bengal must be taken out of the hands of theMinister.   He discusses in his telegram 38-S five methods : The first is that the Governor should iecide that his special responsibilityfor the prevention of any grave menace to the peace and tranquillity of theProvince is, in fact, affected by Ministerial incompetence, and that, therefore,rejecting their advice, he should issue to Ministers such orders as in the exerciseof his individual judgment he thinks essential. The present Acting Governordoes not hold that his special responsibility is or can be so attracted. Since thedecision whether or not it is, is taken by the Governor in his discretion and in theexercise of his discretion the Governor is amenable. to directions from theGovernor-General, it would be within the latter&apos;s competence to direct theGovernor to decide that his special responsibility is attracted. Lord Wavellrejects this course as unsatisfactory, but there is no reason why Lord Wavell and[26697] B
Mr. C asey should not later take a different decision from the Acting Governor,and, though it may be a stretch of the intention of the Act, it is certainly not more so than resorting to Section 93 merely on the grounds of inefficiency.The second, which is similar to the first in that it presumes the retention ofMinisters and their primary responsibility for food, but contemplates the exerciseoLthe Governor&apos;s individual judgment in constantly, if necessary, overruling his ministers and requiring them to do other things than they advise, is that whichI suggested to Lord Linlithgow as constitutionally not improper and as designedeither to secure that what seemed necessary to the Central Government was done with adequate efficiency or to lead to the resignation of an incompetent Ministry.Lord Wavell rejects it because of the uncertainty whether at any particular stage in the fulfilment of a long-term direction the responsibility rests still with theProvincial Ministry or with the Central Government; because, even if the bengal Government set themselves to comply with the directions of the Centre,they would do so too slowly and too grudgingly for compliance to be effective,and because it is not certain that it would bring about the Ministers&apos; resignation and entry into a Section 93 situation which is what he really aims at.The third may be dismissed as unsuitable owing to the time factor. In thepress of Parliamentary business we cannot be sure of getting passed in time socontroversial an amendment as one that would take out of Ministers&apos; handsa function so peculiarly theirs as the food supplies of the people. (Lord Wavellis, of course, wrong in believing that by discarding this method parliamentary discussion would be avoided.)The fourth course is a Proclamation under Section 93, but limited so thatthe Governor would assume to himself only those powers which are necessary toenable him to control the food situation. The Viceroy holds, and my advisersshare his view, that it would be found within a very short space of time that this limitation was impracticable and that assumption of all Ministerial powers was inevitable. For this very reason -which from one point of view commends thiscourse, since it would indicate a determination to preserve to the utmost limit theresponsibility of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor-the Viceroy rejectsit as inadequate.From this his recommendation of the fifth course follows logically that is ofa Proclamation under Section 93 assuming to the Governor at one stroke-as in allthe other Section 93 Provinces-the whole gamut of Ministerial powers, the suspension of the Legislature, and direct rule with the aid of Advisers.(Whether these should be all official or some non-official is a further problem.)But this entails the&apos; dismissal of a Ministry, predominantly Moslem league in outlook, which commands a working majority in the Legislature, for reasons which it could not be disguised were in fact a conviction of its. insufficientefficiency.This is a fiat rejection of the principle of Provincial autonomy and thequestion before my colleagues is whether for the more certain avoidance, it is to be hoped, of a repetition of the disaster of the last few months, this reversal of policyis to be made. What Lord Wavell refers to as constitutional technicalities arethe statutory provisions by which the policy and intention of Parliament weregiven expression. - ,Having regard to the terms of Section 93 (the text of which will be found inAppendix II), the material point is whether it can properly be said that thepresent situation is such that the government of the Province cannot be carried onin accordance with the provisions of the Act. The position under the Act is broadly that the Governor is not entitled to reject the aid and advice of his council of Ministers in the matters, inter alia, of Civil Supplies and PublicHealth, save (i) where the Central Government has given certain directions in thesematters, with which the Ministers decline to comply, or in the carryingout of which they prove obstructive; andv.   (ii) where their advice would, if accepted, affect the due discharge of one or&apos;( ,: other of the Governors special responsibilities.The point at issue, therefore, is whether, short of the application ofSection 93, the provisions of the Act are inadequate to meet the situation in that,in cases not covered by either of the above two contingencies, the Governor must accept from Ministers whom he sees no reasonable chance of replacing by othersmore effective for these purposes, advice which will, in his opinion and in that ofthe Governor-General, prove disastrous.L. S. A.India Office,10th January, 1944.
APPENDIX I.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 22nd December, 1943.(No. 2808-S.)Bengal situation. Have just visited Dacca, Calcutta and 24 Parganas,.Famine conditions (? are) much less in evidence than they were two months agoowing to fine Aman harvest and effect of military aid. But there is much miseryand disease. Military medical units and officers have reinforced totally inadequate civil organisation and Mission Hospitals and good work is being done on treatment of malaria (? and) dysentery patients and mass cholerainoculations. We are, however, only touching fringe of vast health problem and aftermath of famine is likely to remain in lowered vitality of large propor-tion of population. Blankets and clothing are being distributed but supply is far below demand. Immediate situation is reasonably well in hand and I amon the whole satisfied with the result of emergency measures initiated in October/November. Army is doing magnificent work and relations with the population are excellent.2. Unfortunately long-term prospects remain extremely doubtful. Ministryhas made little or no progress with establishment of civil supplies organisation in districts and is still hovering over details of Aman procurement scheme. i fear present harvest will go (? under) ground or get into unscrupulous dealershands like the last. There is much graft and knavery. Officials and people indistricts have no confidence in the Ministry and believe Bengal will starve itselfagain next summer. Prices of rice which fell (% sharp)ly a fortnight ago are I now hardening. Mayne, Wakely and Stuart are all most apprehensive and I ffagree with them that famine conditions will probably be recurring in spite ofthe bountiful harvest unless vigorous action is taken. It will not be from lackof food but from lack of efficient administration. Rutherford is no longercapable of vigorous action and has declined to override the Ministry. His view is that no Ministry can cope with the situation and that as long as a Ministryexists, Centre and not Governor must coerce it.3. Rationing of Calcutta is now announced for 15th January, delaybeing due to Suhrawardy&apos;s refusal to use (? anything) but Government shops and to insistence of Ministry on maintenance of strict communal proportions instaffing both shops and Rationing Department. To stop further delay I have authorised issue of direction under Section 126a of Constitutional Act, requiringMinistry to establish a specified number of shops and to include a specified numberof trade as well as Government shops. This is, however, only one of the &quot;mattersrequiring attention.4. What Bengal needs is vigorous Section 93a Administration, coupled with changes among senior officials and the establishment of competent civil suppliesorganisation, &quot;staffed by personnel borrowed from the army. Unless mattersimprove very shortly (?I cannot) leave Ministry to muddle itself into a secondfamine which owing to the weakened state of the population will be worse than this year. ;. . .5. The delay in selecting new Governor and getting him into position hasbeen most unfortunate and I fear that even now Cabinet do not realise urgency of the situation, shock to our prestige of Bengal breakdown and extreme difficultyof repairing it. I trust that you will expedite Casey&apos;s arrival by all meanspossible.   Every day&apos;s delay is dangerous.Telegram from?Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 2^.th December, 1943.(29452.)Your telegram of the 22nd December, 2808-S. I am impressed by yourserious view of the outlook in Bengal, and by your fear that unless things improvevery shortly you will feel compelled to have recourse to Section 93. By whatprocess do you contemplate that Section 93 situation would be brought about?Possibility of such development was discussed with your predecessor last september, and I should be glad if you would refer to his telegram of the4th September, 1932-S, my telegram of the 9th September, 20541 and his telegram(particularly paragraph 4) of the11th September, 1993-S. ;   . ,   .;;
2. Risk of decrease in administrative efficiency was deliberately taken byParliament when it enacted provincial autonomy in 1935, and I should find itdifficult to hold incompetence as of itself a justification under the Act forGovernor dismissing a Ministry which commands majority in, and thus purportsto retain the confidence of the Legislature and electorate. It was agreed inSeptember that if dictates of efficiency required suspension of Ministry this mightbe brought about by the issue of directions or legislative enactment by the Centre(statutory position of which fortunately is still such as to leave Governor-Generalunder S. 41 of Schedule IX sole judge&apos;of interests of any part of British India)under Section 126a, consequence of which would be either (a) to confront the Ministry with a position which, they could not tolerateand from which they would choose to escape by resignation, or(&amp;) a failure of the Ministry to co-operate with the Governor (whose special responsibility would be attracted under Section 52 (1) (g) with theresult that he would have legal justification for overriding oreventually dismissing them. Upon the resignation or dismissal ofMinistry, Governor would of course require to satisfy himself that no alternative Ministry commanding support in the Legislature, and prepared to co-operate in the war effort was possible before he couldresort to Section 93.3. If, as I judge, conditions no longer, as in September, justify attraction ofSection 52(1) (a), foregoing seems to me to give some support to ActingGovernor&apos;s view reported in paragraph 2 of your telegram in that ground forcoercion of Ministry must be afforded by the Centre. I note from your paragraph3 that directions are already being issued under Section 126a. This may itselflead to the development contemplated above, but if these and other centraldirections are complied with by Ministry, what ground remains for dismissalother than judgment that it is inefficient by our standards % You will see that weare on the verge of some pretty fundamental issues..4. As regards time-table, Cabinet have important M.E. matters to discuss with Casey and cannot agree to his coming direct. I have telegraphed urging himto expedite his programme and come here at once staying only 3-4 days,but have not yet received his answer. If you are convinced that immediaterecourse to Section 93 is inevitable you may have to consider whether it might notbe preferable that it should be brought about before the new Governor takes office.Otherwise the odium of introducing so drastic a measure might be a considerablehandicap at the beginning of his term. On the other hand, it would seem fairerto him, if we can afford the time, to allow him to form his own judgment of thesituation, and of the possibility of getting Ministers to face the measures necessary. After all, we have chosen a man with wide Cabinet experience in thehope that he can give guidance and drive to a Ministerial team.5. With reference to your paragraph 4, I should be glad to know more fullywhat you have in mind in your reference to changes among senior officials. Itmay be well that civil administration requires strengthening in the higher rankswhich as I read Rutherford&apos;s letters have been rendered despondentby subordination to successive Ministries, but you will, be conscious that a newGovernor devoid of Indian, let alone Bengal experience, will need to relyparticularly at the outset on the local knowledge of his service advisers.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 6th January, 1944.(38-S.)Your telegram No. 29452, 24th December : Bengal situation. We must not let constitutional technicalities obscure realities of situa-tion. Bengal famine of 1943 and its aftermath of misery and disease are gravenational disaster with death roll which, will never be known, but may amount to1 million or more. If we believe that this disaster, which was largely due to ministerial incompetence, may be repeated perhaps on an even larger scale in 1944and that remedy is direct administration by Governor^ then we must find means to apply the remedy whatever constitutional position may be. I admit the forceof what you say about provincial autonomy, but there must be some limit to theprice we pay for preserving it.3. Food Department have reported that Ministry have failed to take andseem unlikely to take in time the administrative measures necessary to regain and
(? retain) control. These are energetic execution of procurement plan, control of stocks and prices through effective enforcement of Food Grains Control Order,and early introduction of rationing in Calcutta. Failure is due to inadequacy of administrative machinery, reinforcement of which is far too slow, Lack ofconfidence both of officials and of public in Ministry is evident, and tendency for prices to rise is most alarming at this time of year. Wheat prospects in Punjabare bad, and, although current rice crop in Bengal should be more than sufficient for Bengal needs during 1944, Food Department fear that artificial shortageswill be created which administration will be too weak to remedy, and that lastyear&apos;s disaster will be repeated with less hope of outside aid.4. Food Department a few days ago recommended direction by Centrerequiring Bengal Government to establish official Food Board with specifiedpowers and concurrently referred to you for amendment of Constitution Act byinsertion of Section analogous to Section 57 to empower Governors to bring supplyand distribution of essential commodities into discretionary field. Food board would be under Ministerial control, but Food Department hoped that in practiceGovernor would supervise.5. On receiving this advice I sent letter to Governor by hand of DeputyPrivate Secretary to the Viceroy on the 4th January asking whether in his opinionBengal Government had (i) clear procurement policy, (ii) adequate organisation to make purchases, (iii) adequate civil supplies of staff both at headquarters andin districts for purchase operations and (? terms) and to control stocks and pricesunder Food Grains Control Order, (iv) adequate organisation for rationing ofCalcutta, including storage and distribution. If the answer to any of thesequestions negative, I asked if, in Governor&apos;s view, defects were so serious as to involve, real risk of fresh breakdown. Also whether, if Governor favoured inter-vention, he was confident of (? success) and what extra officer staff he needed toensure success. I did not specify kind of intervention contemplated, but left this for discussion between Governor and Deputy Private Secretary to the Viceroy,who knew my views.6. Governor has replied to-day and his views, with my comments, are summarised in my immediately succeeding telegram. I am satisfied that we oughtto intervene and that decision to do so must not be influenced by change of governors. Casey could not express independent view for some weeks after his arrival, and by then breakdown may be unavoidable. Next two to three monthsare critical for aman procurement.7. Five methods of removing food from Ministerial control have beensuggested as theoretically possible :-First. Decision by Governor that he has a special responsibility in foodmatters under Section 52 (1) (a) of Constitution Act. Governor&apos;s decision wouldbe final under Section 50 (3), and on taking it he could exercise much closer control,overriding Ministry as he thought fit. Rutherford does not hold that he has orcan have special responsibility for food unless actual danger of breach of peace is involved, and although my experts advise that he could be ordered underSection 54 (1) to hold otherwise, I do not consider this method satisfactory. Itdoes not place food in discretionary field and as long as Ministers are in chargedelays will occur which may be cumulatively disastrous.Second. the by Central Government of powers under Section 126a. Thisis not satisfactory when object in view is steady application of policy over a long-period as opposed to a single clearly defined act, since issue of direction at onceobscures administrative responsibility. Ministry can say that direction hassabotaged provincial policy which would otherwise have been successful, AvhileCentre can say that direction has not been properly applied. There can be no certainty that Ministry would resign. Even with reasonable goodwill onMinistry&apos;s part results must be slow and goodwill is most unlikely.Third. Amendment of Constitution Act by insertion for period of war only of Section analogous to Section 57 giving Governor power to take over and administer in his discretion the dispensement and distribution of any essentialcommodity if it appears to him necessary to do so. This remedy has beendiscussed before. It would be only partially effective for reasons given underfourth below. Parliamentary legislation would be slow and debates might be most embarrassing.Fourth.-Partial application in Bengal of Section 93, the proclamation being so worded as to cover assumption by Governor of powers only in respect of civilsupplies and finances connected therewith. This is the course recommended bythe Governor.   I do not agree with it because administration of civil supplies
and finances connected therewith cannot be isolated from general administrationof province.. Finances of Bengal are in deplorable condition, and power to raise,taxes and float loans is inseparable from power to handle food situation.Similarly public health is important part of relief work, and food administrationmust be in a position to use all transport facilities and have at their disposalthe services of Government personnel in all departments to extent required for efficient working.Fifth-Full application in Bengal of Section 93 by dismissal of ministry for failure to take necessary food measures followed immediately by declarationwithout attempt to form alternative Ministry. This is realty the only straightway of dealing with the situation. If it is held that the present Ministry cannotdeal with the situation, it is certain that no alternative Ministry could succeed,(? and) possible leading members of alternative Ministry such as Fazlul Huq andMukerjee have shown lamentable lack of public spirit throughout the crisis.8. I realise the grave political disadvantages of this course. But, althoughMoslem Leaa; ue may k ick, especially in Eastern Districts of Bengal, there will be many political elements in favour of direct official control and League oppositionmust be faced. I do not think Jinnah is in a position to bring about resignation of Punjab Ministry on this issue (the Sind Ministry might be glad of a pretext for resigning and is less important), and he would get little sympathy for anyagitation in other Provinces.9. Your view is that Section 93 can be employed only when administrationbecomes constitutionally impossible and not as a remedy for inefficiency. Butsurely you cannot push this argument to the point of sacrificing another millionlives on the ground that they are being sacrificed in a strictly constitutionalmanner.- If we cannot use Section 93, what action do you suggest on the basis that palliatives will not do and that only direct official administration at earliest date can save the situation ?10. As regards senior officials, Williams is not a suitable Chief secretary and Stevens seems too rigid for head of food organisation. Williams should betransferred and Stevens might replace him, being replaced in turn by moredynamic administrator, possibly a senior army officer. (? Section) 93 Advisersessential and. in my opinion, must be officials. Rutherford prefers mixed bodyof officials and non-officials, including Premier, but I consider this would prejudice success (? of) change. Other non-officials not compromised by their conduct during crisis would be difficult to find. One problem in Bengal is lowmorale of services due to Ministerial interference, and non-official advisers mightbe no improvement on Ministers in this respect.11. Governor seems satisfied that even without additional staff he would do better than the Ministry. I will ask Commander-in-Chief if some additionalarmy officers can be made available.12. If you agree about Section 93, a communique explaining reasons willhave to go out. In fact, we shall have to prepare ground both here, in UnitedKingdom and in Washington before proclamation is issued. I will telegraphdraft communique for your concurrence.13. I would prefer not to issue direction under Section 54, but will do so ifRutherford insists. I am. however, definitely against letting the existence of direction be known.14. Grateful for earliest possible reply on constitutional issue. Pleasediscuss with Casey, who will probably find it less embarrassing to take over withthis matter already decided. Please remember that overriding consideration mustbe danger of repetition of disaster on larger scale, with consequent effect on operations in S.E.A.C. and on public opinion throughout the world.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 6th January, 1944.(39-S.)My immediately preceding telegram : Bengal situation. Following issummary of RutherforcTs views : Begins: Bengal Government have a clear pro-procurement policy. Organisation for procurement ought to be adequate, but thereis doubt about firm selected as purchasing agent for eastern Bengal. Civilsupplies staff is adequate for procurement and movements, but inadequate forenforcement of Food Grains Control Order. Organisation for rationing Calcuttawill be adequate. If intervention is decided upon Governor can do better thanMinistry, as he is free from communal and other inhibitions and can deal direct
with services. Additional staff requirements cannot be stated accurately at suchshort notice, but thirty junior officers might be required to work in districts. For(? the) sake of confidence civil supplies administration and connected financeshould be taken out of ministerial control and placed in discretionary field, and itmay be necessary later to take over famine relief and local self-government andpublic health. Governor cannot certify that (? situation) has arisen in which thegovernment of province as a whole cannot be carried on in accordance with pro-visions of Act, but is prepared to certify that administration of civil suppliescannot (? under these circumstances) be carried on and to issue proclamationlimited to civile supplies administration only. He therefore favours partialapplication of section 93. This might lead to Ministry&apos;s resignation, in which case he would accept full application of section 93. If Secretary of State andViceroy decide upon immediate full application of section 93 he would requiredirection under section 54. He would recommend mixed body of official and non-official advisers.   Ends.2. Following are my comments : Governor&apos;s conclusion (omission) follow from his premises. He is clearly satisfied that food administration is unsatis-factory, but, except for weak enforcement of Food Grains Control Order, points to no specific defects. He does not mention morale of services, low state of whichdue to ministerial interference, and consequent lack of confidence is vital factor in situation. I am quite clear that Ministry are most dilatory and that their arrangements are not adequate either for procurement or for enforcement ofFood Grains Control Order. Governor himself favours partial intervention, butI do not see how this could work. Power to raise taxes and loans, to make useof personnel in other Government Departments and to control are essentialelements in food and relief administration. Also, public health and medical services and considerable interference with local authorities are essential partof relief work. My final conclusions are stated in immediately preceding telegram.
APPENDIX II.Section 93 of the Government of India Act, 1935.93. (1) If at any time the Governor of a Province is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Province cannot be carriedon in accordance with the provisions of this Act, he may by Proclamation :  (a)&apos; Declare that his functions shall, to such extent as may be specified in the proclamation, be exercised by him in his discretion;(b) assume to himself all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by anyProvincial body or authority;and any such Proclamation may contain such incidental and consequentialprovisions as may appear to him to be necessary or desirable for giving effectto the objects of the Proclamation, including provisions for suspending in wholeor in part the operation of any provisions of this Act relating to any Provincialbody or authority :Provided that nothing in this subsection shall authorise the Governor toassume to himself any of the powers vested in or exercisable by a High Court,or to suspend, either in whole or in part, the operation of any provision of thisAct relating to High Courts.(2) Any such Proclamation may be revoked or varied by a subsequentProclamation.(3) A Proclamation under this section : (a) Shall be communicated forthwith to the Secretary of State and shallbe laid by him before each House of Parliament;(b) unless it is a Proclamation revoking a previous Proclamation, shall cease to operate at the expiration of six months :Provided that, if and so often as a resolution approving the continuancein force of such a Proclamation is, passed by both Houses of Parliament, the proclamation shall, unless revoked, continue in force for a further period of twelve months from the date on which under this subsection it would otherwise have ceased to operate, but no such Proclamation shall in apy *:ase remain inforce for more than three years.(4) If the Governor, by a Proclamation under this section, assumes to himself any power of .the Provincial Legislature to make laws, any law madeby him in the exercise of that power shall, subject to the terms thereof, continueto have effect until two years have elapsed from the date on which the Proclama-tion ceases to have effect, unless sooner repealed or re-enacted by Act of theappropriate Legislature, and any reference in this Act to Provincial Acts,Provincial Laws, or Acts or laws of a Provincial Legislature shall be construed as including a reference to such a law.(5) The functions of the Governor under this section shall be exercised byhim in his discretion, and no Proclamation shall be made by a Governor underthis section without the concurrence of the Governor-General in his discretion.Section 1 of the India and Burma (Temporary and miscellaneous provisions) Act, 1942.1.
