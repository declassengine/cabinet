s InTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENTSECRETCOPY No.W.P.(44) 2714th January, 1944WAR   CABINETDIRECTION   OP   YOUNG   MEN TO   THE   COAL   MINESMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service desire to bring to the notice of my oolleages the very serious situationwhich seems likely to arise in the mining industry.It will be remembered that the Cabinet decided that I must find 30,000young men for the mines during the first half of 1944.     I proceeded accordingly to make the necessary arrangements, including the ballot, and with carefulpropaganda and the help of the press it has been possible to get the positionaccepted very well by the persons concerned and their parents.I now understand that the transport position is such that during the comingoperations the truck shortage may become so acute that it will not be possibleto move away from the pits the coal which is produced.      Moreover, I understand from the Minister of Fuel and Power that in certain areas it will not be possibleto stack coal as an alternative to carrying it away.unless s wago ns areUnless, therefore, special steps can be taken to see that the coal is moved from those pits where it cannot be stacked during the next few months it appearsthat numbers of miners will stand idle.    This, of itself, is sufficientlyserious,   but even more serious will be the fact that the direction of young mento the mines will have served no useful purpose, while it will be useless to direct more of them until the situation changes.We could, of course, suspend the direction of these young men but this would undoubtedly cause a violent reaction against the Government in the House, since it could not be argued that we did not know that the military operations were insight or that we were not in a position to know how much coal could be moved.Moreover the reaction in the public mind to this failure to exercise ordinaryforesight in the use of our compulsory powers would make it impossible to use these powers to anything like the same extent in future.I may say that I took every possible step to satisfy myself before agreeing to this policy that these young men could be trained, that they could be usedavailable.
properly and that without them sufficient coal could not be produced.     I am,therefore, seriously disturbed to find what seems likely to happen and I askfor a thorough examination of the -position in conjunction -with the ministers concerned to ensure that:-(1)   adequate arrangements are made to move or stack the coal when it ismined and(2)   that minors are not idle and that the scheme of directing young mento the mines does not break dosm because there is no work for them*E.
