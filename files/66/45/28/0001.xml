PART I.-ALLIED naval CONTINGENTS.French Navy.THERE have now been a number of occasions on which personnel of theformer Free French Navy have come into contact with that of the former Vichyships, including the Squadron from Alexandria. These meetings usually start with a certain amount of coldness and standoffishness,. but after a short time the atmosphere improves and, as a general rule, tolerance prevails and a desire isshown to let bygones be bygones.2. There is little doubt that the mass of the French people consider thattheir Navy let them down and that the Fleet had no excuse for not leaving Toulon;unfavourable comparisons are made with the despised Italians, who did succeed in getting their ships away in what must have been more difficult circumstances.3. The officers now serving in the former North African ships are fully aware of the low esteem in which they are held in their own country, and it is not surprising that they should suffer to some extent from an inferiority complex.It is natural, too, that the officers and men of the former Free French Navy should endeavour to maintain their individuality and look forward to a more friendlywelcome when they do get back to France.4. The dismissals of Admirals Michelier and Godfroy, which have followedothers of high-ranking officials accused of collaboration, may cause unrest in theFleet, even if it shows the strength of the Committee of Liberation.5. The Battleship Richelieu, after her refit and alterations to armament in new York, arrived at Algiers in October. As she was not required for operations in the Mediterranean, she proceeded at the end of November to join the home fleet at Scapa Flow.6. From letters which have passed through the censorship, it is apparent that her personnel are very pleased at being in a position which may lead to action with the Tirpitz or other of the large German units which remain. Theywere, of course, bitterly disappointed at not being present at the action with the scharnhorst.   They are proud of their ship and morale is good.7. The Chief Engineer is a former Free French Officer, who wears hisCroix de Lorraine, and, although this is an isolated instance, it may perhaps betaken as an example of getting the two parties together.8. Admiral d&apos;Argenlieu, commanding the French Naval Forces in GreatBritain, visited the Richelieu at Scapa and went to sea in her for a day&apos;sexercises.   Subsequently he addressed the crew.9. Admiral Lemonnier, Chief of the Naval Staff in Algiers, accompaniedby his deputy, Admiral Auboyneau, came to this country just before Christmasto discuss certain outstanding matters with the Admiralty. They expect to returnto North Africa early in January. During their stay they also visited theRichelieu at Scapa. It appeared to British Officers who were present that thisvisit was genuinely appreciated by the ship&apos;s company.10. The French have been gradually taking over more and more of the coastal defence and general harbour duties in the North African ports.Operations.1.1. The Cruisers have been employed principally in anti-blockade patrolsin the Atlantic, and the Destroyers on Convoy Escort in the Mediterranean.12. Some Submarines have carried out patrols in the Mediterranean and theProtee scored a probable hit on a 3,000-ton merchant vessel. The Orphee scored aprobable hit on a Fleet tug.A llocation of Ships.13. The first of the four River Class Frigates to be taken over on loan to theFrench, the Windrush, has now completed her working-up. The Torridge andBraid are expected to complete at the end of January. These three have beenmanned with former Free French personnel. The fourth one, the Frome, will bemanned by personnel from North Africa. She is also due to complete about theend of January.[26713] B 2
14. Permission has been requested to rename these ships Le Decouverte,L&apos;&apos; Escarmouche, L71 venture and La Surprise respectively.15. It is intended that they shall be employed in Western Approaches in thefirst place.16.   Six Destroyers and six Escort Vessels are to be allocated by the U.S.A.Ships Recovered in Italy,17. The two Destroyers Tigre and Trombe, which were in Italian hands,have now been returned to the French Navy.Refitting of Ships.18. The most important units to have completed their refits in the U.S.A.during the quarter are the Cruisers Georges Leygues and Gloire and the destroyers Simoun and Le Malin.Loss.19. The Chasseur Garenton capsized while escorting a British Submarine inthe Channel in bad weather.   There were only six survivors.Polish Navy.20. Much anxiety and some unrest was evident amongst Polish naval personnel, due to the absence of any pronouncement as to Poland&apos;s futureboundaries after the Moscow Conference. This was particularly the case in theDragon whose crew includes a large proportion of ex-prisoners of war fromRussia. Tension has since eased a little, but this question undoubtedly remains a factor which should be kept in mind when considering the morale of Poles who arenot actively employed. The fighting spirit in the seagoing ships remainunimpaired.21. During the working-up of the Cruiser Dragon, serious electrical defectsdeveloped in the Fire Control System, and it became necessary for her to returnto Dockyard hands. After nearly three months she has now started to work up again.22. Three of the Polish Destroyers, Piorun, Krakowiak and Slazak, havebeen employed in the Mediterranean during most of the quarter.23. The Submarines Sokol and Dzik have also been employed in the Mediter-ranean and have carried out a number of successful patrols. The former sank two large merchantmen of Pola in October and five small craft during a patrol inthe Cyclades in November.24. On another patrol in December off Lemnos, the Sokol sank two 4,500-ton merchant ships and several schooners and caiques. She also scored two hits on a4,000-ton merchant ship, which is believed to have sunk.Loss.25. The Destroyer Orkan was lost in the North Atlantic on the 8th OctoberOnly one officer and forty-three men.were saved. This represents a heavy loss of trained personnel for such a small Navy.Royal Netherlands Navy.26. The Gunboats Flores and Soemba are still, in the Mediterranean. TheFrigate Johan Maurits and the Corvette Friso have been employed on convoy escourt in the Mediterranean.Successes.27. The Submarine 0.15, on patrol off the Norwegian coast on the26th December, fired torpedoes at three merchant vessels of about 2,500-tons, eachin an escorted convoy of six ships. Three hits were obtained. Later the escort was seen to be lying stopped in the position of the attack with nothing else in sight.Ships Commissioned.28. The Submarine Zwaardvisch on the 12th October. She is expectedto leave shortlv for the Far East
29. Four more Motor Minesweepers have been allocated and the first one has been commissioned.Refits of Submarines.. 30. K. 14 and K. 15 completed their refits in this country and have left for the Far East.31. 0.23 is at present refitting and 0.21 is on her way to thiscountry from the Far East.32.   0. 24 is proceeding to the United States for refit.Paid Off.33. The Gunboat Gruno has been reduced to care and maintenance owingto shortage of personnel.34. Eleven M.T.Bs. in the West Indies have been laid up for the same reason.Royal Norwegian Navy.Successes.35. The Destroyer Stord, in company with Savage, Saumarez andScorpion, took part in the torpedo attack which resulted in bringing the scharnhorst to her final action with the Duke of York. Commander-in-Chief,Home Fleet, made the Norwegian Commander-in-Chief a signal to say that hewas very proud of her.36. The Submarine Via carried out a successful patrol off the norwegian coast in November. On one day she sank a merchant ship of 3,500 tons, andalso an 800-ton whaler which was escorting that vessel. Two days later sheattacked two large merchant ships with torpedoes and at least one of them was hit.Ships to be Commissioned.37. Owing to their age and limited capabilities, it has been decided to payoff the two &quot; Town &quot; Class Destroyers St. Albans and Lincoln and to offer the norwegians the Shark a Fleet Destroyer, due to complete in February, intheir place.38. Four more M.T.Bs. are to be manned by the Norwegians and thesecraft will be attached to the 62nd M.T.B. Flotilla, which is to be formed atLerwick. They will thus operate from the same base as the 54th Flotilla, whichis entirely Norwegian.Depot.39. Owing to our own requirements, it became necessary to ask theNorwegian Naval Authorities to move their shore establishment from PortEdgar.   Alternative accommodation has been provided at Edinburgh.Royal Navy (Section Beige).40. Two Motor Minesweepers were manned in October, thus making four of this type now in service. It is expected to commission a further two in thelatter part of January.Royal Hellenic Navy.41. Greek Destroyers have been rendering excellent service on convoy escourt in the Mediterranean.Allocation of Ships.42. In addition to the &quot; Flunt &quot; Class Destroyer and the three Corvettesmentioned in the last report, it has now been decided that the following shouldalso be allocated on loan to the Greek Navy :  43. The Fleet Destroyers Boreas and Arrow and the &quot;Hunt&quot; ClassDestroyers A vonvale and Cowdray.
44.   The following new names have so far been decided upon : Hursley Crete.Hyacinth A postolis.Coreopsis Kriezis.Tamarisk Tombazis.Boreas Salamis.Cowdray /aegean.Avonvale Admiral Hastings.45.   Arrow is to be taken over at Taranto, where she is refitting.46. The Boreas, Avonvale and Coivdray are all at present refitting in thiscountry and the crews for the first two are expected to arrive early in January.47.   The old Destroyers Kondouriotis and Mtos have been paid off.48. Four American-built Motor Minesweepers (B.Y.M.S.) have been taken over in the Mediterranean to replace some older Minesweepers which have been paid off.49. A number of auxiliary patrol craft have also been taken over in theUnited States and are at present proceeding to the Mediterranean.50. The four L.S.Ts. which had been taken over in the United States arrived in this country in November and subsequently proceeded to the Mediterranean.51. The Destroyer Adrias was mined off Kalymnos and beached. Shesuffered twenty killed and twenty wounded. Subsequently her Captain succeeded in getting her off and steaming her astern the whole way to Alexandria. TheAdmiralty have expressed their appreciation of this fine feat of seamanship.Royal Yugoslav Navy.52. The Corvette Mallow was commissioned in October and proceeded towork-up. In the initial stages the lack of trained seamen in the crew made itselfmuch felt and progress has been very slow. It is hoped that she will have reached a reasonable degree of efficiency shortly and be able to proceed to the Mediter-ranean.   She is to be renamed Nada.53. Other difficulties have arisen, possibly due to racial questions, but it ishoped that a recent visit by the Naval Attache will have had beneficial results.54. A further 300 volunteers were recruited in Italy and as many more areexpected to follow.55. None of the more important units of the former Yugoslav fleet have beenfound in Italian ports so far occupied, but a number of small ships were foundand fourteen were transferred to the Yugoslav Flag on the 8th December. Theemployment of these ships has been restricted owing to the political situationbetween the Partisans and the Government and it is as yet too early to make anycomment on the usefulness of this personnel.Danish Contingent of the Royal Navy.56. Recruiting has continued and the Contingent now numbers aboutseventy-five. The main difficulty is finding suitable engine-room personnel, and itcannot yet be stated when the two Minesweepers will be commissioned.PART II.-ALLIED ARMY CONTINGENTS.General Remarks.57. Military Missions to accompany H.Q. 21 Army Group overseas have beenappointed by the Dutch, Belgians, Poles and Czechs. A Norwegian military mission has also been appointed to accompany the Allied H.Q. proceeding to norway. The Dutch, Belgian and Norwegian Missions have been attending con-ferences on the planning for a return to the Continent in the event of a collapse of Germany. That they have been consulted on the plans for the unopposed returnto their own countries has given much satisfaction and confidence to these governments.
58. The morale of all the Contingents remains high, and it is generally believed that soon the long period of inaction will be over, and they will have anopportunity to take part in active operations. The desire to fight to assist in the defeat of Germany, and to avenge the happenings in their country, is increasinglystrong amongst all the Allied Contingents. The great majority of the men feelthat they cannot return to their countries with their heads high unless they have fought. Postal Censorship indicates the high regard which is held for the peopleof this country by the Allied troops, and their gratitude for the hospitality andfriendship shown to them by the civil population.French Forces.59. A second parachute battalion arrived from North Africa in November.The French Forces in this country now consist of two parachute battalions and adepot at Camberley, consisting of odd units which are in process of being moved to North Africa.  The majority of the French troops are strong de Gaullists.60. The two parachute battalions are now training in Scotland. one battalion has completed its preliminary parachute training. The intention isthat when trained these battalions will form part of an S.A.S. Brigade. Theofficers and men are very keen and energetic on training that interests them, andshould do well in an S.A.S. role. Their administration is weak, and their regard for sanitation and cleanliness of billets is primitive. British officers have beenattached temporarily to these units, and they have been successful in effecting some improvement in method and general cleanliness.61. The French Commando troops have carried out some useful minoroperations.Polish Forces.62. In the past the great majority of the Polish officers and men were strongly of the opinion that no alteration of the 1938 Polish Frontiers could beaccepted, and no support would be given to their Government had they enter -tained any ideas of Frontier adjustment. It has now been realised that some alteration of the Eastern Frontier may be unavoidable, and that the Poles should recognise this and should be prepared to face realities. Morale is- high, and theRussian successes and their approach to the Polish Frontier are greeted with greater satisfaction and less feelings of uncertainty than in the past.63. General Sosnkowski returned recently from his tour to North Africa,Italy and the Middle East, where he inspected the Polish Corps. He was verypleased with his visit and his reception by Allied Commanders.64. The Polish Middle East Corps is in process of moving to Italy, and itis reported that all ranks are full of enthusiasm at the prospect of being engagedin active operations.   The Corps is well trained and should do well.65. The reorganisation of the 1st Armoured Division to British establish -ments is now complete. The age-limit for Command and Staff Appointments hasbeen lowered. The Division is about 600 under strength, but it is expected thatit will be up to establishment in a few weeks&apos; time.66. This Division did very well when training with its old organisation under the Eastern Command last autumn. Facilities for Armoured training inScotland are very limited, and the ground does not permit more than Regimentaltraining. The Division requires several weeks in a good training area, after which it should be a first-class armoured division.67. The 2nd Polish (Grenadier) Division has been organised in cadre form.All units are represented and are composed of a high proportion of officers andspecialists.   The strength of this Division is about 2,500.68. The Polish Parachute Brigade is about 2,800 strong, well trained andis composed of high-class material. This Brigade is retained in the hands of thePolish Commander-in-Chief and is not included in 21 Army Group.Dutch Forces.69. The Princess Irene Brigade has, until recently, been located at Harwich,where it has been responsible for the defence of the Naval Base. The garrisonduties have to a certain extent interfered with training, although good exercises
have been held with the Royal Navy. The Brigade has recently moved toFrinton, where it will have unrestricted facilities for training. A comb-out ofall unfit men has recently been made, and, as a result, the Brigade is rather under-strengthed; further reinforcements are expected from overseas in the nearfuture.70. This Brigade is still backward in its collective training. The young officers and men are very keen, but the weak element continues to lie in some ofthe senior officers. The Dutch Authorities have so far been reluctant to replace them.Norwegian Forces.71. The Brigade has recently moved to the Callander-St. Andrew&apos;s area,where it continues to train with 52 Division.72. Morale is high and the Brigade is making progress in its training. it took part in a large-scale prolonged exercise under the direction of the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief, Scottish Command, which disclosed certainweaknesses in training and organisation which require improvement.73. The Parachute Company trained with 6 Airborne Division and estab-lished a high reputation for itself.74.   The Commando Troop has been engaged in several minor operations.Belgian Forces.75. The Belgian Brigade is moving shortly from Lowestoft to Ramsgate,where it will train with 61 Division.  A change of scene will do good.76. The Brigade is increasing in strength and is doing well. It is free from politics, is well commanded and the morale is high.77. The Depot at Leamington continues to contain the idle and politically-minded officers. The Belgian Authorities rightly concentrate their useless officers at the depot.78.   The Belgian Commando Troop has distinguished itself in Italy.79. The Parachute Company is well trained, very keen and composed ofexcellent material.Czechoslovak Forces.80. The Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade is training in theMarket Harborough area. Good progress has been made and Squadron training has been commenced. The Brigade is now equipped with Crusader M. VItanks. Signal exercises for the Brigade have been arranged by the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Command, in whose opinion the Brigadeis shaping well. The Czechs are excellent soldiers, very keen, and the majorityof the senior commanders and staff officers are doing well in their Armouredrole. The young officers are excellent. Later on an opportunity for FormationTraining in a good area will be required. The Contingent which arrived fromthe Middle East in September has been absorbed into the various units, and hassettled down in its new surroundings. There are no political problems in the brigade, although minor difficulties of an unimportant nature occasionally occurwith Jews, Slovaks and Sudeten Germans.Note. A statement showing the strength, organisation and location ofAllied Contingents in the United Kingdom is attached at Appendix II.PART III.-ALLIED AIR CONTINGENTS.General Notes.Morale.81. -Morale in the Allied Air Forces has in general remained high, but thatin the Royal Yugoslav Air Force appears to be suffering as a result of the present political crisis.Post-Hostilities Planning.82. More and more the Allied Air Force Authorities are concentrating onproblems that will face them when Germany collapses.
83. All appear to have leanings towards a system of international control ofthe Air, to which they would contribute; but some also evince an attitude of mindreminiscent of pre-war nationalism. They seek to ascertain from the Air Ministrywhat will be the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the smaller nations who wish to re-develop their military and civil aviation and what help they may expect to receive from Great Britain in the way of material and training.Numerous requests for immediate facilities are also being received that are clearlyprompted not by present needs but by hypothetical requirements in the future.Sometimes modest enough individually, these requests call in the aggregate for an expenditure of-effort that can ill be spared until victory is won.84. The Heads of the Polish, Norwegian, French and Dutch (Army) AirForces have exchanged informally with Air Vice-Marshal Sir Arthur Longmore(Post-Hostilities Planning) views on the future composition and role of their AirForces. Neither side has been committed by the discussions and, while the ten-tative suggestions put forward by Sir Arthur received in general much support from the Allies, the Allies are obviously hopeful that at an early date HisMajesty&apos;s Government will, through the Air Ministry, be in a position to makeknown the main outlines of its post-war policy. The Czechoslovak Air Force is inparticular studying the organisation of the R.A.F. with a view, apparently, to building their post-war Air Force in Czechoslovakia on R.A.F. lines.A Hied Expeditionary A ir Force.85. On the 31st December an exchange of Stations by 3 Squadrons in theA.E.A.F. led to an interesting situation, which may, owing to operational require-ments, become almost normal.86. No. 322 Dutch Squadron moved out of No. 9 Group into No. 11 Group(both in A.D.G.B.) and took over the aircraft of No. 350 Belgian Squadron,No. 350 Belgian Squadron moved from No. 11 Group into the 2nd T.A.F. and took over the aircraft of No. 222 (R.A.F.) Squadron. No. 222 Squadron movedout of the 2nd T.A.F. into No. 9 Group A.D.G.B. and took over the aircraft ofNo. 322 Dutch Squadron.87. But Servicing Echelons of these Squadrons did not move, so that theBelgian Echelon is maintaining aircraft for the Dutch Squadron, the R.A.F.Echelon for the Belgian Squadron and the Dutch Echelon for the R.A.F.Squadron.Note. (The actual period covered in this Air Report is from the 21st September to the20th December, 1943, both days inclusive, except in the case of Allied Units in the 2nd tactical air Force, where figures of operational hours flown, sorties made, successes gained and casualties suffered are given only for the period 21st September to the 30th November. 1943.Figures for December, not yet received, will be included in the next report.)French Air Forces.General.88. The number of French Squadrons in the RAP. Target Force is to beraised to 12. Eight Squadrons all operational are already incorporated, namely2 Day Fighter Squadrons and a Light Bomber Squadron in the Allied Expedi-tionary Air Force, 3 Day Fighter Squadrons in the Mediterranean Allied AirForce and 2 Naval Air Arm Squadrons in West Africa..89. The personnel required for the formation of 2 Heavy Bomber squadrons in Bomber Command are now all under training in the United Kingdom, and these squadrons are expected to form in April and May 1944.90. The personnel for 2 more Day Fighter Squadrons are due to reach thiscountry from North Africa in January 1944, and it is hoped that before the endof May both these 2 will be operational in the Allied Expeditionary Air Force,and that the target of 12 Squadrons will have been reached.91. Outside the .R.A.F. Target Force the French have in the Mediterraneanarea 5 Squadrons including a Naval Air Arm Squadron, 1 on the Russian Front,and in addition it is intended that they should develop 18 Squadrons in theU.S.A.A.F. Target Force, a number of which are already formed and operating inthe M.A.A.F.   *r96713] c
Personnel from North Africa.92. Nearly 2,200 French Air Personnel including those for the 2 bomber squadrons and Bomber Station, and pupils for aircrew training to support all 12French Squadrons in the R.A.F. Target Expansion, have arrived in the UnitedKingdom during the quarter.93. Refresher training of so large a number of trained aircrew, and theorganisation of R.A.F Station Filey Town referred to in paragraphs 131 and 132of the 26th Report for the reception and training of both trained and pupilaircrew, have thrown a heavy strain on Flying Training Command, and not allthe difficulties have yet been fully overcome. The task of training or refreshing in technical Training Command some 1,400 French ground personnel for the bomber squadrons and Station has not been made easier by the fact that not inconsider-able numbers of the airmen sent from North Africa for the lower trade groupposts are of a very low type of Spanish-Arab extraction, some of whom are evenilliterate. It is clear that the French Higher Air Authorities in North Africanever intended that such personnel should have been sent to this country, and thatthey are doing all they can to prevent this occurring again, and to rectify themistake made. It is appreciated that the French are finding difficulty in producing men qualified for lower trade group posts because their &quot; AidesMecaniciens &quot; have not generally been given a schooling in first principles such asis given to lower group tradesmen in the R.A!F., but have merely been attached toUnits to assist skilled men and pick up knowledge as best they can.Training,in North Africa.94. A team of R.A.F. Instructors has been attached to the Air Mission inAlgiers to assist in organising refresher training of French Pilots and BomberCrews destined for operational training in the United Kingdom. This training is given a,t the French School at Marrakesh, to which essential training equipment is being&apos;or has been sent. Eight Wellington aircraft have been allotted tothe school for training purposes. A suggestion has been made to French AirHeadquarters, Algiers, that French Naval Air Arm pilots destined for R.A.F.Target Squadrons should share in these facilities at Marrakesh.A administration.95. The decision to allow the French in the United Kingdom as much&apos;administrative independence as possible is being effected. In establishmentsspecially provided for them French Military Law applies, and when a FrenchOfficer of appropriate rank who is not himself a pupil is named by the FrenchHeadquarters to be French Senior Officer, at a station where there is a FrenchDetachment, he is to be responsible to the Station Commander for maintainingdiscipline according to French Law.96. The French Authorities have accepted full responsibility for pay and accounts.Morale in the United Kingdom.. 97. In No. 341 Squadron morale was of the highest order while they werein an active sector. Now that both Fighter Squadrons are in a light sector the morale of pilots has fallen a little, due it is thought to fear lest they may be unable to return to the Second Tactical Air Force in time to play their part inthe early stages of the Liberation of France.98.   Morale in 342 Light Bomber Squadron has been good.99. Morale amongst the French aircrew and pupil aircrew at Filey Townhas been somewhat damped by the rigours of the English winter, and a lack ofcertain facilities and amenities which have yet to be organised.Air Mission to French Committee of National Liberation.100. The Chiefs of Staff in October decided to appoint Service Missions tothe French Committee of National Liberation. The Air Liaison Section referredto in paragraph 140 of the 26th Report will be the nucleus of the R.A.F. mission and will remain as a separate entity in Algiers should the Headquarters of theMediterranean Air Force move elsewhere.
Armee de VAir.Operations [United. Kingdom).101. Nos. 340 and 341 Day Fighter and 342 Light Bomber Squadrons in theA.E.A.F. have flown some 1,400 hours on operations, the first two destroying12-J enemy aircraft and damaging 2. The Light Bomber Squadron made a successful attack on Chevilly-la-Rue, destroying the Transformer Station there.Operations (Overseas).102. Nos. 326, 327 and 328 Day Fighter Squadrons in M.A.A.F. took partin operations over Sicily and Corsica and gave protection to convoys in theMediterranean.103. Of the Armee de 1&apos;Air Squadrons outside the RAF. Target ForceII/3 (Hurricane TIC) has been used for limited operations with the north african Coastal Air Force. It is to be re-equipped in April with P. 47aircraft. .Bretagne Squadron.104.   This Squadron has moved from Syria to Algeria for re-equipmerwith B. 26 aircraft.Levant.105. The Picardie Flight with 6 Blenheim IV Aircraft is to be reinforcedwith 10 A. 35 aircraft. This unit was guilty of provocative action during theLebanese crisis. It demonstrated over Beirut at house-top level carrying bombs.It was necessary for the PAP. authorities to take drastic steps to ensure against any repetition.106. The Ardennes Squadron (III/3) has received 25 Hurricane IICaircraft and when operational will relieve an R.A.F. Squadron. It is to be disbanded in July 1944.Russia.107. The Normandie Squadron is resting after intensive operations on theOrel front, where it claims to have destroyed 77 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed 24 for the loss of 21 pilots. Replacement pilots are being sent from north Africa.A eronautique Navale.Operations.108. No. 343 (Sunderland) and No. 344 (Wellington) Squadrons in WestAfrica have carried out frequent anti-U-boat patrols, and made several attacks on enemy submarines, some with success.109. Part of 4S Naval Air Arm (not in the R.A.F. Target Force) hasbeen operating from Corsica with the N.A.C.A.F., and has also been employed in air/Sea Rescue.Replacement Aircrew.110. There is reason to believe that the French Naval Air Authorities willsend crews regularly to the United Kingdom for operational training for somemonths, but it is not yet certain that they will be able to maintain the flow untilpupil aircrew, who have recently started their training, are ready to be made into replacement crews for these Squadrons.111. Every effort is being made to dissuade the French from planningexpansion beyond their resources of trained personnel.Catalina Squadron.112. A French Catalina Squadron is being trained in the United states for general reconnaissance duty off the North-West African Sea-board, whereit is expected to be operational in April 1944. It will not be part of the R.A.F,Target Force.[26713] c 2
Polish Air Force.Operations.113. In Bomber Command No. 300 Squadron made 39 bombing sorties and 254 mine-laying sorties, during which 461 mines were laid in enemy waters.The Squadron operated on three nights against Hanover.114. The squadron&apos;s excellent reconnaissance reports on the night of the24th-25th October enabled the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Nore, to intercept alarge force of enemy E-boats across their line of retreat.115. In the Allied Expeditionary Air Force 7 Day Fighter, 1 Intruder and1 Fighter Reconnaissance Squadron have flown 5,800 hours by day and 13 by night, destroying 32 enemy aircraft, probably destroying 12 and damaging 12.In Coastal Command No.&quot; 304 Squadron made 138 sorties, during which theywere not lucky enough to meet the enemy. The squadron was non-operational forthe first 7 weeks of the quarter, whilst being converted from Wellington XIII toWellington XIV (Leigh Light) aircraft..116. In Balloon Command the Polish Flight has continued to give very satisfactory service.Re-equipment.117. No. 305 Squadron is being re-equipped with Mosquito aircraft in the2nd Tactical Air Force, and is at present non-operational.118. 1 Flight of No. 300 Squadron is re-equipping with Lancasteraircraft. The whole squadron is to be re-equipped with this type by the end ofJanuary 1944.New Ancillary Units.119. To the 7 Mobile Signals Units, Air Stores Park and Repair andSalvage Unit, ancillary to the 2 Polish Airfield Headquarters in No. 84Composite Group of the Second Tactical Air, Force, has been added No. 72 PolishM.T. Light Repair Unit.120. In the Middle East No. 5500 Polish Mobile Signals Unit has beenformed to provide W/T and Radio facilities for No. 318 Polish (F.R.) Squadron.Movement of Unit.121. The Polish Flight in No. 138 (S.D.) Squadron has been re-established as No. 1586 Polish (S.D.) Flight and transferred to the Mediterranean Allied AirForce.   It is to be based in Italy and operate as a unit.Man-power.122. So far as ground personnel are concerned, Polish resources availablein the United Kingdom are already strained to. meet the needs of Polish Unitsformed and forming.123.   As a result of the representations referred to in paragraph 169 of the;26th Report, the Polish Commander-in-Chief agreed to release 1,400 personnel from the Polish Army in the Middle East to reinforce the P.A.F., 500 for aircrewand 900 for maintenance duties.124. About 120 of these for aircrew training and a small number for groundduties are expected to reach this country in January 1944. There is some doubt whether suitable personnel to the full number promised will, in fact, be released.Morale.125. Morale in the P.A.F. as a whole is high. In No. 300 Squadron(Bomber Command) it is good, in squadrons in the A.E.A.F. excellent; and it is interesting to note that in No. 304 Squadron (Coastal Command) their lack of opportunity during the quarter of damaging the enemy has not apparentlydamped their ardour.Visits.126. The Inspector-General of the P.AT., in company with the PolishCommander-in-Chief, has visited most of the Polish Operational Units and sometraining establishments in the United Kingdom, and also HQ., R.A.F., middle east, and the Polish Units in that Command.
Royal Dutch Naval Air Service.Operations.127. No. 320 Squadron (Mitchell B. 25 aircraft) in the 2nd T.A.F. hadflown by the end of November 351 hours. It has taken an active and successfulpart in bombing operations over Northern France. The Dutch commanding officer was lost on operations, and while his successor-designate (a Dutch officerfrom No. 321 Squadron) is gaining experience of home conditions, a R.A.F. officer is in command.128. No report has been received of the,work of No. 321 Squadron based in ceylon. It is known to possess a few reserve crews, but the Dutch Authorities are finding difficulty in providing replacement crews.Recruiting.129. A small number of Netherlands Naval personnel have been recruitedfor training as W.O./A.Gs. and A.Gs. Only a few recruits have been obtainedfrom other sources.130. Morale in No. 320 Squadron has been very good and sometimesexcellent.Royal Dutch Army Aviation (R.A.F.Y.R.).Morale.Operations and Morale.131. No. 322 Squadron has not been heavily engaged during the period andhad flown aircraft up to the end of November for only 45 hours. Morale has been of a high order in spite of this, and is likely to rise with the impending move ofthe Squadron to a more active sector.Recruiting.132. Recruits for aircrew training have been little more than 60 per cent,of the planned flow.  A few have been obtained for aircraft maintenance.Royal Norwegian Air Force.Operations.133. In the 2nd T.A.F. Nos. 331 and 332 Day Fighter Squadrons up to theend of November had flown aircraft for 2,345 hours, destroying 29, probablydestroying 3 and damaging 14 enemy aircraft.134. In Coastal Command No. 330 Squadron (Sunderland) made 37 sortiesfrom Sullom Voe on routine anti-submarine patrols in which they were 82 percent, effective. The Mosquito Flight of No. 333 Squadron made during the whole period 29 sorties on ship reconnaissance, destroying 3 enemy aircraft and probablydestroying 1. The Catalina Flight of this Squadron made on anti-submarinepatrol, convoy escort, and special duties 22 sorties.Morale.135. In both Fighter Squadrons, morale has been very high. It has been good in No. 333 Squadron. In No. 330 Squadron, while the aircrew have remainedkeen, the remarks on morale generally in the Squadron in paragraph 182 of the26th Report are still true. The possibility of moving this Squadron from northern Areas and of changing its equipment and role is being explored. Thetask of providing replacement Sunderland crews comprising 10 members is over-straining Norwegian resources.Recruiting.136. Recruiting has practically ceased, although there are probably justsufficient personnel in the Norwegian Depot in Canada to maintain existingUnits throughout 1944.The Belgian Air Force (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations and Morale.137. In the A.E.A.F. Nos. 349 and 350 Day Fighter Squadrons flew aircraft for 624 hours and morale has been reported as very good and sometimes excellent.
Recruiting.138. 28 Officers have been commissioned and 74 airmen enlisted. 20 officersof the Belgian Congo &quot;Force Publique &quot; are to be brought to the UnitedKingdom. Belgians are steadily reaching this country through Spain and thepresent flow into training for both aircrew and ground crew should be well maintained.Reorganisation.139. Progress has been made in the reorganisation foreshadowed in para-graph 187 of the 26th Report. A draft appendix to the existing Anglo-BelgianAgreement in terms agreed with the Belgian Authorities has been submitted bythe Foreign Office to the Belgian Government for formal approval, and the forma-tion of a Belgian Inspectorate-General, now agreed in principle, is imminent.140. The old Belgian Aeronautical Depot has been disbanded and replaced by 2 RAP. (Belgian) Units, an Initial Training School to prepare candidates forRAP. Flying and Technical Schools, and a Depot to receive and despatch trained and non-effective personnel and to be a Rest Centre for officers and airmen.General.141. Due to the fact that before the war. the Belgian Aviation was an integraland very small part of the Belgian Army, the Belgian Air Attache and senior officers of the Belgian Aviation in the United Kingdom have had little power to influence the Belgian Government. It is not surprising, therefore, that theBelgian Section of the R.A.F.V.R., after long and close association with theR.A.F., should hanker for some large measure of autonomy for their Service afterthe war. The younger element seem to be developing a pronounced internationalrather than national outlook, and have expressed the somewhat surprising wish that, even after peace is declared, the Belgian Air Force should remain within the framework of the R.A.F.142. Whether the Belgian Inspector-General will succeed in leading theBelgian Government to a better understanding of Air Force needs and aspirationsand secure for the Belgian Air Force a better hearing in their Ministry ofNational Defence and a fairer.share of available resources of man-power and materials, remains to be seen. :  - .Czechoslovak Air Force (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations. -143. In the A.E.A.F., Nos. 310, 312 and 313 Day Fighter Squadrons haveflown on operations over 2,400 hours, destroying 1, probably destroying 2, and damaging 3 enemy aircraft.144. In Coastal Command No. 311 Squadron, now fully trained in the use ofboth depth charges and rocket projectors, has been employed continuously on anti-submarine sweeps, making in all 149 sorties. On 5 occasions U-boats were sightedand on 3 attacked. On a single day, 2 U-boats were attacked by an aircraft, one with D.C.&apos;s and the other with R.P.-S. Oil rose to the surface and spread, rapidly.On another day a single aircraft attacked a U-boat with R.P.&apos;s. It lost speed and, as a result of this and later attacks by other aircraft, was sunk. The squadronalso destroyed 1 Ju. 88 and damaged 4. The squadron is still below strength infully operational crews, but this situation is likely to improve.Morale.145. In the squadrons in the A.E.A.F. morale has varied from &quot; very good &quot;to &quot;of the highest order.&quot; In the Coastal Command Squadron it has been highand the relations between Czechoslovak and R.A.F. personnel most satisfactory.It has been noted that some of the aircrew would prefer the more exciting workof Bomber and Fighter Squadrons, though apparently this has not reduced theirenthusiasm for the more prosaic duties of a Coastal Squadron.Recruiting.146.   The growing weakness of Czechoslovak resources of man-power noted&quot;&quot; in paragraph 193 of the 26th Report has increased.    Only 18 recruits were obtained during the quarter.
Proposal to form a Unit in the U.S.S.R.. 147. The Air Ministry has agreed to a proposal that 20 experiencedCzechoslovak Fighter Pilots should be sent to Russia to form a flying echelonof a fighter squadron. The concurrence of the Soviet Authorities is awaited.Should these pilots go, the disbandment of one of the Czechoslovak Day fighter squadrons in the A.E.A.F. will probably be necessary at a not far distant date.The Royal Hellenic Air Force.Operations and Morale.148. Nos. 335 and 336 Day Fighter Squadrons, operating in No. 219Group, took part in the operations over Crete during November. It has beenagreed that both shall soon receive 3 Spitfire aircraft. No. 13 G.R. squadron in No. 201 Group has been re-equipped with Baltimore aircraft. Morale ingeneral has been satisfactory.Recruiting and Proposed Expansion.149. The flow of candidates for aircrew training is still less than it shouldbe, but the Greek Government has agreed to the release, probably by the end of1944, of some 300 Greek Army volunteers for aircrew, and also to the GreekAir Force having a first oall on the next class of conscripts.150. The Greek Minister for Air has been asked to give an assurance that sufficient trained Greek air and ground crews will be available to justify con-si deration being given to the formation of a 4th Greek Squadron. The agreedtarget is 5 squadrons.Royal Yugoslav Air Force.Operations.151. The Yugoslav Fighter Flight, now up to strength, has taken part in operations over Crete during November and forms part of No. 94 Squadron.152. One Yugoslav crew has been operating in No. 203 G.R. Squadron andhas been congratulated on a sortie made during November.Expansion.153. It is hoped that a Yugoslav Light Bomber Flight can be formed ina R.A.F. Baltimore Squadron by the end of February 1944. Three crews are ready, 9 are in O.T.U. and the necessary maintenance personnel are being given special training on Baltimore aircraft.Training.154. It has been decided that all Yugoslav candidates for aircrew training-shall be sent to the Union of South Africa and not, as stated in paragraph 99of the 25th Report, to Southern Rhodesia as well.Recruiting.155. About 450 recruits have been selected from Slovene prisoners of warand other sources in North Africa. Eighty-five of these are being sent to SouthAfrica for aircrew training. The remainder will be trained as maintenancepersonnel in Maintenance Units in the Middle East.Morale.156. There are signs that morale in the Yugoslav Air Force is beingadversely affected by the present difficult political situation.
