(i^u^zZ^JL*&amp;^4     Mil (1414.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.\   S Copy No.WAR CABINET.FINANCE OF RELIEF IN THE MILITARY  PERIOD.Memorandum by the Minister of State.AT its meeting on the 23rd December the War Cabinet invited me to arrangefor an examination by Departments of the finance of relief during the MilitaryPeriod.   .Representatives of the Foreign Office, the Treasury and the War office have considered the question in the light of the paper from the Chancellor of theExchequer which was before the War Cabinet, W.P. (43) 5S1, and, in particular,the possibility of arranging that the requirements of the Military authorities for civilian supplies should be at a very early stage cast in the form of a request for supplies financed by UNRRA. I have also discussed the matter with theChancellor of the Exchequer and we have agreed on the following joint memorandum.R, L.Foreign Office, l$th January, 1944.secret.P. (44) 38..l%th January, 1944.1. The objections to an arrangement of the kind suggested are that if therequirements of the Military Authorities are submitted to FJNRRA there is thedanger that time will be consumed in the consideration of them by UNRRA andthe danger of our not being ready with supplies at the proper time, which isalready beginning to appear, might be much intensified. Further, UNRRAmight expect the requirements to be presented to it in some detail and securitymight thereby be endangered.2. In addition, the War Office point out that it is essential to avoid dividedresponsibility for the supply of a territory during the Military Period.Consequently the presentation of requirements to UNRRA would have to be onthe basis that there could not be room for criticism by UNRRA.3. Finally, there might be danger that if the requirements of the MilitaryAuthorities were put as a request for supplies financed by UNRRA, that body would expect to have a right to inspect the arrangements for distribution withinthe territory which could not fail to embarrass the Theatre Commander in the performance of his functions.4. There are possibly still ways of making the cost of civilian relief duringthe Military Period form a charge on UNRRA funds without raising theforegoing objections, but we cannot afford the time to discuss these, as it is urgentthat the position should be clarified with the Americans and with UNRRA. the essence of our position is that we cannot afford to saddle ourselves with any appreciable chance of having to exceed  80 million as our contribution to relief,and certainly not with the unlimited commitment which might be involved bythe exclusion of the cost of relief during the Military Period from our contribution to UNRRA.5. We therefore agreed that the annexed telegrams should be despatched toLord Halifax. This has been done, and the matter is now reported for theinformation of the War Cabinet.12251   [26752]
6. It will be noted that the instructions to Lord Halifax, while stating ourposition in definite form, leave it to his discretion whether to offer at the sametime an arrangement by which the cost of relief during the Military Period could in form be made a charge on UNRRA funds.7. Since the last Cabinet discussion we have had a telegram from washington, Remac 637, stating the United States Treasury view that relief supplies during the Military Period should be outside of and not part of the1 per cent, contributions to UNRRA on the ground that these contributions willnot be more than adequate. The United States Treasury add that they regard the matter as one for the Foreign Economic Administration, which is subjectto general policy direction from the State Department, rather than for the UnitedStates Treasury.8. The. United States Treasury view reported in the same telegram addsthat for the same reason relief supplies to ex-enemy territories should be outsidethe 1 per cent, contribution to UNRRA. The Cabinet decision on this wasthat relief for enemy or ex-enemy territories should be carried out through themachinery of UNRRA on the basis that payment would constitute a claim with high priority on the resources of the territory in question. At the time theCabinet had every reason to suppose that the Americans shared our view since they had voted with us on the question at Atlantic City.9. It was in the new situation disclosed by Remac 637 that it became necessary to take up this point at once, and it is for this reason that it is referredto in the annexed telegrams to Lord Flalifax, although it is outside the scope ofthe report which the Minister of State was asked to make.10. The War Cabinet at its discussion on the 23rd December agreed thatfor the time being no public statement should be made in regard to the finance of relief for enemy or ex-enemy territories or of relief during the MilitaryPeriod.-&apos; It wijl, however, be necessary to present a new Vote of Credit toParliament on the 25th January, and an extension of the Vote of Credit willhave to be proposed on this occasion to enable our contribution to relief to becharged against it. It will probably be convenient to combine with this a general statement on the results of the Atlantic City meeting, the resolutions passed atwhich have now been published as a White Paper (Cmd. 6497). There may possibly be some difficulty in avoiding any reference to the costs of relief for enemy territories or during the Military Period; but we could perhaps confineourselves to stating that the matter is under consideration, unless meanwhile theposition has been clarified with the Americans and with UNRRA.ANNEX 1.Mr. Eden to Viscount Halifax (Washington).(No. 5.   Relief.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, lbth January, 1944.WAR Cabinet has had under consideration the Atlantic City resolutions.Following deals with the financial aspect: 2. United Kingdom net National Income for year ended 30th June, 1943,is estimated at approximately  7,800 million. Corresponding figure in the lastbudget White Paper for calendar year 1942 was  7,384 million. For the purposesof paragraph 4 of UNRRA Financial Plan we shall round up these figures to 8,000 million, of which 1 per cent, is  80 million.3. The War Cabinet take the view that in principle this figure mustrepresent maximum United Kingdom contribution to relief in all areas at all times. Please therefore inform the State Department that when we agree tocontribute 1 per cent, of our National Income this must in principle be a con-tribution to cover the cost of all relief and that we propose to charge up against our 1 per cent, the cost of all relief contributed by us to the ex-enemy territories and the costs of relief reaching civilians in any areas during the period of military control so far as these costs are not paid by the recipient countries.4. On question of relief for ex-enemies we have understood that UnitedStates share our view expressed at Atlantic City that - such relief should be
provided as a charge against funds available to UNRRA subject to a claim for payment from the territory which would have a high priority. War cabinet have confirmed this view though they have decided that no public statement onthis question should be made at present. They had in mind that United Statesvoted with us at Atlantic City and that question is one of obtaining amendedresolution at UNRRA Council. In view of Remac 637 we think it important that you should now confirm with State Department that they continue to shareour view. We do not think it reasonable that our decision should be nullifiedby the fact that the recipient countries and countries which are going to makelittle or no contribution to relief voted us and the Americans down on this question at Atlantic City.5. On relief to the civilian population during the period of military controlWar Cabinet also decided against immediate public statement. You should saythat it is impossible to forecast how long it will be necessary for the military toretain responsibility for administration in any area. Particularly perhaps in areas in which there may be no resources adequate to pay for imported supplies the period of military responsibility might be considerable and the cost of reliefduring that period might be large. If none of this cost is chargeable against our contribution to UNRRA we might find ourselves at the end of the militaryperiod in a position of having contributed largely to relief but nevertheless stillshouldering the commitment of our contribution to UNRRA. We think it isclearly unreasonable to leave our commitment to relief so uncertain as it wouldbe under such an arrangement. We recognise that we may not in practice beable to charge relief in the military period fully to our contribution to UNRRA,but we think it necessary and proper to make it clear that in principle we must do so.6. We have it in mind that our limitation to  80 million of our contributionto all relief could be dressed up so that our contribution to UNRRA remainsformally as at 1 per cent, of our National Income. We think that there need be no difficulty in doing so without infringing UNRRA&apos;s responsibility orinterfering with the arrangements of the military authorities. A suggestion onthese lines is contained in our next following telegram and we leave it to yourdiscretion whether you should volunteer this suggestion or reserve it until state department ask for such a scheme.7. For your information we expect debate on UNRRA on presentation of next Vote of Credit about 25th January. Please let us know State Departmentreactions as soon as possible.ANNEX 2.Mr. Eden to Viscount Halifax (Washington).(No. 6.   Relief.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, 15th January, 1944.MY immediately preceding telegram.The Military Authorities might inform UNRRA of the general scale onwhich they propose to provide civilian relief, e.g., for food, 2,000 calories a heada day, for clothing, the equivalent of, say, five coupons a year a head on theBritish rationing scale and for medical supplies, the proposed standard of provision by units of population. The Military Authorities might also describein general the policies of distribution proposed, with a view to showing thatthey would necessarily be such as in similar circumstances would be adoptedby UNRRA. The approach to UNRRA might be to say that these were therelief policies to be followed, that records would be kept of the assistancerendered and that it was suggested that whether the territory should receivethis assistance free or should be required to pay the suppliers in suitable foreign exchange, should be a matter to be decided in accordance with the arrangementsmade for the operation of UNRRA at Atlantic City. It would follow thatany supplies for which UNRRA determined that payment should not be required would form a charge against the contributions to UNRRA. It would have tobe made clear that UNRRA will not be invited to criticise the scale of provisionproposed nor be entitled until requested by the Military Authorities to sendobservers into the territory to supervise the distribution of relief supplies duringthe Military Period.    There will, however, be no objection to presence of
UNRRA representation at C.C.A.C. discussion about relief. If GovernorLehman urges that the Military Authorities should bring in UNRRA to under-take or assist in the distribution of relief during the Military Period we should give this request our careful consideration in consultation with the United states authorities.2. We do not put this forward as in detail the only or best possible schemebut as indication that a reasonable scheme is possible.3. Please show to Bovenschen Mission. War Office has concurred inforegoing telegrams.
