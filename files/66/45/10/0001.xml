THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET. Copy No.    3 rjW.P. (44) 10.7th January, 1944.WAR CABINET.UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.Note by the Secretary of the War Cabinet.THE annexed report* by the joint Intelligence Sub-Committee is circulatedto the War Cabinet on the instructions of the Deputy Prime Minister.The Chiefs of Staff are making a comprehensive study of this matter witha view to making recommendations to the War Cabinet as to the form theamplification or definition of &apos;&apos; Unconditional Surrender &apos;&apos; might take to (i) ensure a weakening of armed resistance in Germany; and(ii) avoid complicating the negotiation and enforcement of the armistice terms and the Peace Settlement.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES, Secretary.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,7th January, 1944.ANNEX.Report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.We have been instructed by the Chiefs of Staff to examine the policy of&quot; Unconditional Surrender,&quot; particularly as to its effect on the German armed forces and on German morale generally.Civilian Morale.2. Except among the relatively few Germans who will follow Hitler to theend, either from fanatical loyalty or from knowledge that their fate is bound up&apos;with his, two main factors at present combine to prevent the fall in Germanmorale, which has already taken place, from developing into a breakdown indiscipline sufficient to bring about an internal crisis. These factors are fear ofthe Gestapo and fear of the consequences of defeat. Fear of the Gestapo isprobably the more powerful influence, in that it effectively prevents the growth of any organisation such as might serve as a rallying-point for the very largenumber of Germans who no longer have any faith in the Nazi system and whoseonly desire is peace on almost any terms that do not involve their personaldestruction or enslavement. However, the formula of &quot; unconditional surrender,&quot;as interpreted by Nazi propaganda in default of any explanation by the united nations, is having a big effect in making the Germans afraid of the consequences of defeat to themselves individually and collectively.3. Few Germans retain any hope of a German victory; an increasing-proportion realise that Germany is losing the war, if she has not lost it already.The German propaganda machine is working at full pressure to prevent thisrealisation of Germany^ impending defeat from developing into a belief thatthe results of &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; would be preferable to,, their presentsufferings.   The   Germans   are   therefore  being  told   that   &quot; unconditional* J.I.C. (43) 527 (Final).[26686]Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.
surrender &quot; means that they can expect no mercy from the United Nations; thatGermany, to the accompaniment, of. all sorts of horrors, will disappear as a nation; and that the German people as a whole will be held collectively responsiblewith their leaders for all crimes perpetrated. In other words, the Germans arebeing told that they and their leaders must stand together or else both will faceutter ruin.4. There is ample evidence that this.propaganda is having some success in particular, among the uninstructed masses. The more intelligent section of thecivil population, who give less credence to it, are bewildered by the &quot; uncondi-tioiial surrender &apos;&apos; formula. In particular, the more influential classes of german civilians, i.e., industrialists, bankers and senior civil servants must fear, not somuch that &quot; unconditional surrender &quot; would involve the elimination of the nazi regime, to which they do not feel themselves committed, as that it would leadto the destruction of the entire social and economic structure of Germany. Theymust fear that this would not only be fatal to Germany, but also to them person-ally. So long as such men, whose attitude is more important than that of the masses, cannot tell whether unconditional surrender will leave any Germany forthem to work in and for, the whole force of patriotism and personal interest is bound to work in favour of postponing defeat as long as possible. Even thoseamong them who are ambitious to play a larger part in post-war Germany andwho might otherwise look forward to seeing Nazi office-holders eliminated inthe hope of taking their places, -can hardly see scope for their ambition in aGermany of which they can expect so little.5. We therefore conclude that any explanation of the policy expressed bythe &apos;&apos; unconditional surrender &apos;&apos; formula which offered the German people as awhole some hope of continued national existence, some measure of personal security and some prospect of a stabilised economy would at least strengthen the handsof the many who do not feel themselves irreparably committed to Party policy.German propaganda has, however, to some extent been discounting our declaration in advance, and fear of the Gestapo would, in any case, preclude any immediate action on the part of civilians.Morale of the Armed Forces.6. Discipline is still strong enough in the armed forces to.keep them fightingdoggedly. Fear of the Gestapo probably weighs much less heavily on them thanon the civilian at home, but fear of the consequences of unconditional surrenderas interpreted by Nazi propaganda is an important influence with them too.The German soldier, sailor or airman must give some consideration to the future in store for him after defeat. He will be far more aware than the average civilianof the atrocities committed by the Germans and he may have had direct personalexperience of Russian ferocity. Consequently he, too, is haunted by the fear thathe and. his family may in their own persons suffer the full consequences of defeatand of retribution by the United Nations. This will probably be particularlytrue of S.S. formations.7, To this extent a public declaration, defining a little more closely what is meant by &quot; unconditional surrender,&quot; would have an effect on the morale of the armed forces, quite apart from the indirect effect due to German civilian reaction to our declaration. The armed forces will not, however, refuse to go on fightinguntil we have broken the discipline that binds them together. So long as theGerman Home Front holds out, this result is likely to be brought about only by further severe defeats in the field.8. What has been said above applies to the rank&apos; and, file of the armed forces,to the men who have been conscripted from civilian life for war service and whohope after the war to return to their peace-time occupations. The professionalofficer class of the Navy, Army and Air Force are in a different category. their lives are bound up with the services to which they belong; they have been trained in the belief that German armed might is invincible; the bonds of discipline arevery strong; and they can see no future for themselves in any civilian occupation.These men will never accept the idea of permanent military defeat and the stronger characters among them will, if they are given the chance, begin almoston the day of Germany&apos;s surrender, if not before, to plan a military machine,in an attempt to succeed where Imperial Germany and the Nazi Reich have failed, Our ^explanation of &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; will not have muchdirect effect on these men, unless it holds out some hope of the continuation orrebirth of the German military system which it is our declared policy to destroy.
Concisions.9. We therefore conclude that the fear of the consequences of defeatenhanced by the lack of any Allied explanation, to counter Nazi interpretationsof what is meant by &quot;unconditional surrender,&quot; is one of the main influencesthat makes the German civilians and armed forces feel that, even though thereis now little hope of victory, it is still worth while continuing the war. If we could bring home to both the German people and armed forces that &quot; unconditional surrender&apos;&apos; will better serve the ultimate interests of Germany and of the ordinaryman and woman than continuation of the war, we may encourage a withdrawalof support from the regime. Our explanation will not, however, in view of itsprobable terms, greatly affect the professional officer class who, if they ever dointervene to put an end to the war, will do so only when they are convinced thatGermany is no longer militarily capable of altering the final result, and that an earlier termination of the War may enable them to save something out of thewreckage for the eventual reconstruction of the German military system.(Signed) V.
