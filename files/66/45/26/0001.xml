Whereas it has been possible up to now to meet allessential demands^for movement by rail, road, canal and coastingshipsithough with some difficulty and subject sometimes to delays,I am satisfied that this will soon be impossible.Well before the operation is launched I shall have to take up coastal ships in preparation for the operation, and this processwill have to be continued at an increasing rate up to the start ofthe operation itself.    The immediate result must be to throw anadded burden upon the railways, at a time when they are alreadyover-strained and when they have to look forward to further burdensin connection with OVERLORD.I am satisfied that, even after the absorption of the additional labour for which I have asked for ports and internal transport in my note, W.P.(hh.)ll*i0e shall not be able, especially after thewithdrawal of coasters,&apos; to continue to move the present load inaddition to the additional traffic arising from the operation.Clearly, traffic required for the operation must be carried,and the inevitable reduction must accordingly fall on otherinternal movements.   The only practicable method of dealing withthe problem is, I think, for me to indicate to each of my colleaguesresponsible for heavy movements, notably the Ministers of production,Supply, pood, Fuel and power and the Service Ministers, on whattraffics a reduction would give substantial and immediate relief,and to agree with them, in the light of the stock position of andthe urgency of the need for particular commodities and of all other relevant considerations, what reductions must be made.-The need is urgent, and I propose if my colleagues agree toproceed on these lines immediately.J.(L.Ministry of War Transport.lU/th January, 19^4*
