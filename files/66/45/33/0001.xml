THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT--,-,-rr-.- \144Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET. Copy No.    3 5W.P. (44) 33. \f15th Jamiary, 1944.WAR CABINET.UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.Note by the Prime Minister.1. The expression &quot; Unconditional Surrender &quot; was used by the Presidentat Casablanca without previous consultation but I thought it right to endorsewhat he said, and it may well be that at that period of the war the declaration was appropriate to the circumstances.2. By &apos;&apos; Unconditional Surrender &apos;&apos; I mean that the Germans havethereafter no rights to any particular form of treatment. For instance, the atlantic Charter would not apply to them as a matter of right. On the other-hand, the victorious nations owe it to themselves to observe the obligations of humanity and civilisation. The statement by the President in his telegram to me,No. 436 of the 6th January, is a very good popular rendering of this conception^See also my remarks at the Guildhall on the same subject.3. The question is, whether we should go further at the present time inview of the undoubted, truths contained in J.I.C. (43) 527 (W.P. (44) 10). It is perhaps well to look at what is actually going to happen to Germany before deciding Avhether more precise statements would induce them to surrender.First, they are to be completely disarmed and deprived of all power to re-arm.Second, they are to be prohibited from all use of aviation, whether civil or military, and from practising the art of flying.Third, large numbers of persons alleged to be guilty of atrocities are to be handed over for judgment to the countries where their crimes were committed.Premier Stalin mentioned at Teheran that he would certainly require at least4 million Germans to work for many years in building up the ruin they had caused in Russia. I have no doubt the Russians will insist upon the handing over tothem of vast quantities of German machinery to make up in a generous fashion* See Annex.\
for what has been destroyed. It may well be that similar claims will be made by others of the victorious Powers. In view of the great severity practised uponimmense numbers of French, Italian and Russian prisoners-of-war and internees,such retribution would not appear to be devoid of justice.Fourth, the British, United States and Russian Governments are I under-stand agreed that Germany is to be decisively broken up into a number of separate States. East Prussia and Germany east of the River Oder are to bealienated forever and the population shifted. Prussia itself is to be divided andcurtailed. The Ruhr and other great centres of coal and steel must be put outsidethe power of Prussia.Fifth, the entire core of the German Army comprised in the General Staffmust be entirely broken up, and it may well be that the Russians will claim that very large numbers of the General Staff of the German Army shall be either put to death or interned for many years. I have myself wished to publish a list ofsome 50 to 100 outlaws of first notoriety with a view to dissociating the mass ofthe people from those who will suffer capital punishment at the hands of theAllies and of avoiding anything in the nature of mass executions. This would tend to reassure the ordinary people. But these proposals were scouted atTeheran as being far too lenient, though I am not sure how far Marshal Stalinwas serious in this part of the conversation.4. Enough at any rate is set down above to show that a frank statement ofwhat is going to happen to Germany would not necessarily have a reassuringeffect upon the German people and. that they might prefer the vaguer terrors of&quot;unconditional surrender,&quot; mitigated as they are by such statements as thePresident has made.w. s. c.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,Ibth January, 1944.Annex.PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT&apos;S STATEMENT.I made the following public announcement on the 24th December: &quot;TheUnited Nations have no intention to enslave the German people. We wish themto have a normal chance to develop in peace, as useful and respectable membersof the European family. But we most certainly emphasise the word. &apos; respectable,&apos;for we intend to rid them once and for all of Nazism and Prussian militarism andthe fantastic and disastrous notion that they constitute the &apos; Master Race.&apos; &quot;
