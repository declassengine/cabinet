STATES.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.WE have already issued a Report* stating in general terms the Britishstrategic needs in the Levant States. This Report was prepared in response to a request by the Ministerial Committee appointed to consider and report on our long-term policy in Palestine.2. We have now seen the Committee&apos;s Report, t and&apos;have therefore beenable to examine the military implications of their actual proposals. our examination at Appendix I falls into two parts.3. In Part I, for ease of reference, we have repeated the broad strategicconclusions of our previous Paper, and have added our opinion on the militarydifficulties which attach to the Committee&apos;s scheme for partition.4. In Part II we have thought it right to examine our ability to deal withthe unrest which may in any case develop in Palestine during this year, and toput forward certain recommendations on this subject.Conclusions on Part I.5. The main conclusion that emerges from Part I is that the partition of asmall country like Palestine into three separate States is bound to complicatemilitary control because of the multiplicity of treaties and agreements by whichwe shall have to proceed. The demarcation of frontiers proposed by theCommittee also has certain military disadvantages, largely because of the lengthof common frontier between Jews and Arabs and the difficulties which will attendrapid movement of forces from one end of Palestine to the other.Conclusions on Part II.6.   Our conclusions on Part II can be summarised as follows : &apos;(a) In the event of an announcement or leakage of a partition scheme beforethe defeat of Germany, we should be unable to ensure the securityof Middle East territories except at the expense of operations againstG ermany.(b) If the announcement were delayed till after Germany&apos;s defeat, we couldnot^ meet the commitment without detriment to the re-deployment of forces against Japan or the demobilisation scheme or the requirements for the occupation of Germany.&apos;* Appendix II. f P. (M) (43) 29.[26773] B
(c) We recognise that trouble is brewing in Palestine and that we may inany case be faced with a commitment in the first half of this year which we shall not be able to meet unless the Commanders-in-Chiefconcerned are allowed to use Indian divisions for internal security duties in Palestine and the Middle East. It is for considerationtherefore whether we should not attempt to lessen possible trouble byan immediate attack upon the secret Jewish organisations.(d) Before pursuing this suggestion we should like to see an appreciation by the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, and to have the opinion ofthe Colonial Office and Foreign Office on the political issues involved.Recommendations.7.   We therefore recommend : (a) That, if the partition scheme is proceeded with, further consideration should be given to the demarcation of frontiers.(b) That the announcement of any partition scheme should be deferred tillafter the defeat of Germany, and that every effort should be made toprevent a leakage of the fact that this scheme has been underconsideration.(c) That the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, should be asked for an appreciation of the situation likely to develop in Palestine in the nearfuture and that the Colonial Office and Foreign Office should be askedto give an opinion on this question from the political angle.(d) That authority should be given for the employment of British and indian troops in Palestine in an internal security role should the necessityarise.(Signed) A.

APPENDIX I.PART I.BRITISH STRATEGIC NEEDS IN THE LEVANT STATES and ability TO MEET THEM UNDER THE PROPOSED PARTICI-PATION SCHEMEDStrategic Requirements.1. The strategic needs of the British Empire and Commonwealth in theMiddle East are as follows(a) Control of the Eastern exit of the Mediterranean.(b) Security of the sources of oil, their supply lines and their terminalpoints, including, in particular, Haifa.(c) Security of Empire air routes to South Africa, India and the Far East.(d) Security of sea communications.(e) A base for Imperial strategic reserves.2. In order to safeguard these interests, it will be necessary to negotiatetreaties with the various Middle East States, including (if formed) the newLevant States, giving us the following facilities : (a) The right to station in such places in each State as we may require sucharmed forces as. we may consider necessary.   -(b) The right to hold on lease, or other secure tenure, adequate bases andtraining areas.(c) That when, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom, a state of emergency exists, British forces of all deserip-tions shall have complete freedom of movement and absolute priority of passage by&apos; road, rail, air, sea and inland waterway.(d) The right to use all harbours and airfields.(e) The grant to British Commonwealth air lines of full facilities atsuitable airfields, wherever these may be required.Such treaties will therefore have to be drawn on broader lines than those atpresent in force with Egypt and Iraq.3. These facilities will be required in all Middle East territories whether their political control is in the hands of Jews or Arabs. In this respect alone,therefore, the exact demarcation of frontiers in any partition scheme is not amatter of first consequence.   The two points of cardinal importance are (a) That we should obtain the facilities we require.(b) That the internal security of the whole area should be ensured and that,as far as possible, every cause for dispute should be eliminated.These points remain the guiding principles of our military policy for the whole area, including Syria and Lebanon. Agreement must be reached with the Frenchand Arab Governments on the method of implementation in these latter areas.Ability to meet our needs under the proposed scheme of partition.4. In Part II of this Paper we discuss the question of dealing with theimmediate unrest which will follow upon the disclosure of a partition scheme.In this part of the Paper we judge the military implications of the Committee&apos;scheme on the assumption that it has been put into force and that we areresponsible for internal security in the whole Middle East area.5. We recognise that political considerations must dictate our policy inPalestine, and that if on political grounds partition is desirable, we must takeadequate military measures to ensure its success and the security of the area.Nevertheless on purely military grounds we feel that the partition of a smallcountry like Palestine is bound to make control of the area more difficult,especially if the proposal for a Greater Syria is long defended or foundimpracticable.   The sub-division proposed by the Committee not only creates. . * P. (M) (43) 29.[26773] &apos; B 2
three separate States in Palestine, but defines their respective frontiers in sucha way that there are many miles of common frontier between antagonistic Statesand the Arab area in the north is completely isolated from the Arab areas in thesouth.   The results of this will be (a) That we shall have to negotiate treaties and agreements to obtain thefacilities we require from a large number of small States.(b) That there will be ample opportunity for frontier incidents, thus makingthe maintenance of internal security more difficult.(c) The movement of troops from one area to another will be subject toobstacles and delays.(d) The small isolated Arab area in the north will be a temptation to theJews, and hence will entail a considerable internal securitycommitment.6. We suggest that if partition is decided upon the number of States bekept as small as possible and the boundaries drawn with a view to minimising the,difficulties enumerated above in&apos; so far as this is compatible with political considerations. Mr. Law&apos;s proposal, for example, would make the situation in north Palestine easier and curtail the Jewish Arab frontiers by many miles.PART II.POSSIBILITIES OF UNREST IN PALESTINE AND THE middle east IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND OUR ABILITY TO DEALWITH IT.Effect of announcement or leakage of partition scheme.1&quot;. We note that the Ministerial Committee leaves open the timing of theannouncement of the proposals &quot;to be decided in the light of events.&quot; it recognises* that &apos;&apos; a suitable time may be the collapse of German power inEurope .... but happenings in the Levant may dictate action at an earlier date,&quot; and goes on to emphasise that &quot; the important point is that we should beready to&apos;enable the opportunity to be seized when it comes.&quot;2. We are entirely in agreement that the most suitable time for theannouncement should be after we have dealt with Germany. Our reasons,however, are military and not political. The announcement or leakage of such ascheme would, we are told, almost certainly precipitate trouble, now latent inPalestine, where both Jews and Arabs are anxiously awaiting to hear what is totake the place of the present policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. We are givento understand that partition is likely to arouse strong Jewish resentment. There,is at present in Palestine a large Jewish secret army, numbering some 50,000,controlled by extremist Jewish elements whose object to to secure the whole ofPalestine for the Jews, and who will almost certainly resist any scheme of partition.We understand, moreover, that the announcement or leakage of a partitionscheme is very likely to cause disturbances among the Arabs, even if it is accompanied by a scheme for a Greater Syria.3. It would therefore be unsound and unrealistic to plan on the assumptionthat either Jews or Arabs will be willing to accept the scheme. We cannot be certain that revolt can be confined within the borders of Palestine.Military Commitments.4. Ih assessing our possible commitment in terms of armed forces, we must therefore allow for the possibility that there may be widespread disorders, notonly in Palestine, but in all Arab territories throughout the Middle East.5. On this basis we estimate that the total commitment may be eight tonine divisions -with some eleven squadrons R.A.F. The disposition of these forces is shown in a table attached.Availability of forces.6. In present circumstances these forces are not available except at theexpense of operations against Germany. Of the nine equivalent divisions now,inthe Middle East and P.A.I.C., one is earmarked for Italy, one is being assault* p. (M) (43) 29, paragraph 39.
trained for future operations, three are Indian to the use of which there arepolitical objections, one is South African and the rest are largely composed ofAllied forces, who are not suitable for internal security duties, and I.S.F.battalions. We cannot withdraw air forces or divisions from Italy or replace thelatter with any of the formations now in Middle East without affecting operations in Italy; nor is it right to have British divisions and air forces tied up in internal security work at a time when we should be bringing our full weight againstGermany. 1 -;      &apos;.  .- -Any announcement or leakage of a partition scheme. before the defeat ofGermany is^ therefore, likely directly to prejudice the agreed strategy to bring this defeat about.7. If the announcement, were delayed until after Germany&apos;s defeat, we could find the necessary forces but not without affecting one of the following: -(a) The quick redeployment of our forces against Japan.(b) The demobilisation scheme.(c) The forces required for the occupation of Germany.     rr      :%Possible Preventive Action. &apos; &quot; , &apos; &apos; -        ..8. From the purely military point of view, there might be considerable advantage in dealing forcibly with the secret Jewish armed organisations straightaway. Although intelligence about these organisations is not yet complete, wecould undoubtedly, by immediate action, reduce their power and so make any laterrevolt less obstinate and less effective. On the other hand, such action might wellact as a spark in the already inflammable situation and we should have to beprepared to face unrest throughout the Middle East with a similar commitment of some eight to nine divisions. There would also undoubtedly be widespreadpolitical repercussions, particularly in America.9. Before pursuing this proposal further, we should like to see an appreciation by the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, on the military situationand to have the opinion of the Colonial Office, in consultation with the ForeignOffice, on the political issues involved.Use of Indian Troops.10. It is clear that in any case we must be prepared for some commitment in Palestine in the near future which, if Indian troops cannot be employed, weare not, in fact, in a position to meet.11. The Government of India, supported by the Secretary of State forIndia, has objected to the use of Indian troops to intervene in a racial strugglefought for political or religious reasons, that is to say in the event of organisedArab or Arab-Jewish disturbances. This does not preclude their use where the conflict is purely between the Mandatory Power and the Jews. The Secretaryof State for the Colonies, however, is unwilling that Indian troops should beused against the Jews. Even if the conflict is primarily confined to the Jews, theArabs would inevitably become involved either by some untoward incident or because they could not stand aloof.12. In view of the scarcity of troops available in the Middle East, we feelthat the Commanders-in-Chief concerned should be given the liberty to use indian troops for all internal security work as required.Table.Requirements for Internal Security in Middle East in the face of Serious Unrest.Palestine ...      ...Iraq/Syria and LebanonEgypt.........Libya[26773]Land Forces.3 divs. ^1 armd.)2 to 3 divs. .2 divs.I div.Air Forces.2 Fighter Recce. sqn ..I   7 Fighter /Bomber sqn ..2 Tpt. sqn ..

APPENDIX II.BRITISH STRATEGIC NEEDS IN THE LEVANT STATES.REPORTObject of the Paper.1. This report has been prepared in response to a request by the WarCabinet Committee on Palestine that we should state the essential British military needs in the four new Levant States, which they have proposed should be set-up in the territories now comprising Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Trans-Jordan.British Strategic Considerations in the Middle East.2. The strategic needs of the British Empire and Commonwealth&apos;in theMiddle East are as follows : ^Control of the Eastern exit of the Mediterranean.Security of the sources of oil and of their supply lines.Safe use of airfields and other facilities for air routes to India and theFar East and to Southern Africa.Security of sea communications.A base for Imperial strategic reserves.A. Control of the Eastern Exit from the Mediterranean.3. It is essential that in time of war we should control the Eastern exitfrom the Mediterranean, in order :-\(a) To deny to any enemy European State access to the Indian Ocean and far East through the Middle East.(5) To impose an economic blockade. .(c) To establish a base in the Middle East from which to deploy our resources,and to make use of that flexibility which the exercise of. Sea and AirPower provides.4. For these reasons, we must retain, in peace as in war, responsibility forthe defence and control of the Suez Canal, and possess freedom of action in theadjacent States in time of emergency in order to give depth to our defences-of the canal and of the oil installations, and to deny the enemy the use of airfields inthose areas from which they might threaten our security or establish contact between Europe and the Far East. It should be noted that the Anglo-egyptian treaty limits our rights to station troops in Egypt in time of peace, and that theTreaty is, in any case, subject to revision in 1956.B. Security of the Sources of Oil and their Lines of Supply.5. The oilfields in Iraq and South Persia are the most important source of oil supply to the British Empire, and their potential capacity is believed to be many times the present output. The extent of the new fields already surveyed inIraq, Persia and the Arabian Littoral is very great, and further discoveries arenearly certain when surveys are completed. It is, therefore, safe to assume thatthese sources of supply will increase in importance, especially in view of the limited life of the oilfields in Russia and America,6. Supplies from the Middle East oilfields reach the Mediterranean either by tanker from the Persian Gulf or by pipe-line. In peace time, delivery bypipe-line saves shipping and reduces the cost of oil. to this country. In war time,the heavy call on tankers and the threat to our sea communications makes the useof these pipe-lines of vital importance, especially to our fleet in the mediterranean and our forces based on the Middle East.7. The existing pipe-lines from Iraq would run through Greater Syria andterminate at Haifa in the Jewish State, and Tripoli in Lebanon. They are likelyto be augmented by a second pipe-line from Kirkuk to Haifa. A furtherpipe-line from the new fields in Kuweit, Hasa and Qatar has been proposed, andmay well terminate at Gaza in Greater Syria.A.-B-C-D-E.-
8. Haifa contains the only large and efficient refineries and storage tanksin the Levant. Tripoli has a tank farm and a refinery of limited capacity andinefficient design. It must be expected that the number and size of installationswill increase as the oilfields are developed.9. From this it follows that in peace time the security of the oilfields isan economic necessity, and the pipe-lines and installations are of considerableeconomic value to British interests.   In war they are of vital importance.10. The maintenance of law and order in the Levant and adjoining states in peace and their protection in war are, therefore, a major concern. To ensureour interests we shall require the following rights : (a) To take such military action as we may deem necessary in a state ofemergency.(b) To have freedom of movement for our armed forces in each State, andabsolute priority of passage over all means of communications in timeof emergency or war.(c) To hire on a long lease such areas as we may require to safeguard our interests.C. -Safe use of Airfields and other facilities for air routes.11. Whilst it cannot be said with certainty which routes the Empire AirLines will follow, a control centre for air lines to the Middle East, India, theFar East, and possibly Southern Africa, will be required. It seems probable thatairfields situated in the Jerusalem State, especially the airport of Lydda, andpossibly in Greater Syria and the Jewish State, will be necessary links in thechain. Such airfields are of great economic importance in peace. In war,airfields in the Levant area, which would also be required as bases for use by an air striking force, become a strategic necessity.12. We must, therefore, secure the right at all times to develop such airfields and installations in this area as may be necessary, and full facilities for their commercial and military use,D. Security of Sea Communications.13. The principal sea route between the United Kingdom and India andthe Far East is by way of the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. A longer routeinvolves an uneconomic use of shipping which is at a premium during war-time.E. A Base&apos;for Imperial Strategic Reserves.14. A most convenient site for strategic reserves of the armed forces of theBritish Empire and Commonwealth is in the neighbourhood of the eastern mediterranean, because this is a nodal point of our sea and air communications.Situation after the War.15. The measures which it will be necessary to take will be dependent on anumber of factors such as (a) The character of any World Security Organisation.(b) The policy of the United States, who are becoming progressively more interested in these areas because of the oil potentialities.(c) The nature of our relations with other nations, especially France, Russiaand Turkey.(d) The stability of the proposed Independent States.(e) The settlement of the local Jewish-Arab problems.(/) The relations of the Independent States with other interested Powers and movements, such as France, World Jewry and Arab Federation.16. It is impossible to forecast at the present time the effects of any of these factors.17. The records of the Iraqi and Egyptian Governments, since their countries achieved independence, are a warning against placing too much relianceupon the three proposed independent Levant States as pillars of our security in
time of crisis. Moreover, the Jewish question is likely to continue as a disturbingelement in the cirGcij  is the contemplated settlement may not continue to satisfyJewish ambitions.Conclusions on Strategic Needs.18. We conclude that the peace and security of Greater Syria, Lebanon andthe Jewish and Jerusalem States is of the utmost importance to the BritishEmpire and Commonwealth and must be maintained. We should, therefore, do everything in &quot;our power to ensure the integrity and peaceful development ofthese States. The right to station adequate British forces and to control air and naval bases and means of communication in that area after the war is anessential British interest which should be secured by treaties binding each State.The analogous treaties which were entered into with Egypt and Iraq sufferedin their application because details of military requirements were too preciselydefined. Although it may be difficult in the treaties made with the Levant states to obtain terms more favourable to us than those provided for in the Egyptian and iraq treaties, we should try to avoid over-precision and state our requirements as broadly as possible.19. The following are the general arrangements which we consider it shouldbe our object to establish : 1 (a) The right to station in such places in each State as we may require sucharmed forces as we may consider necessary for the defence of our interests.(6) The right to hold on lease, or other secure tenure, adequate bases and.training areas.(c) That when, in the opinion of His Majesty^s Government in the UnitedKingdom, a state of emergency exists, British forces of all descrip-tions shall have complete freedom of movement and absolute priority of passage by road, rail air, sea and inland waterway.(d) The righlt to use all harbours and airfields.(e) The grant to British Commonwealth Air lines of full facilities atsuitable airfields wherever they may be required.(/) The agreement of the new States concerned, and also of Iraq andSaudi Arabia, to levy no toll, tax, excise or customs duty on any oilpassing through but not for use in their respective territories.Instead, and as an additional incentive to maintain peace and order,there should be paid to each State a royalty on all such oil, less thecost of repairing any wilful damage caused to the pipe-lines in that state.20. In return for the foregoing rights, His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom should be prepared to guarantee the independence of the four-proposed Levant States. &apos;21. As the proposed partition cuts across the present frontiers of Syria andLebanon, the position of France, which legally is still entrusted with a mandateover these States, may require re-examination. Political considerations mustnot, however, be allowed to override our minimum requirements for defence asset out in this paper.Timing of the Announcement of the Settlement.22. The announcement of the proposed Partition Scheme is likely to create a considerable internal security requirement in the Levant States, and this maywell extend to the whole of the Arab world. The timing of any announcementtherefore calls for very great care, and no announcement should be made untilGermany is defeated, since any such disturbance is unlikely to be short lived.23. If His Majesty&apos;s Government decide to announce the plan for the partition before the end of the war with Japan, the existing military position must be safeguarded.
