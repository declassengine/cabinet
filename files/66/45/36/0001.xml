THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 36.ISth January, 1944.WAR CABINET.EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR IN THEUNITED KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT their meeting on the 16th September, 1943, the War Cabinet reservedfor later consideration the question whether further batches of Italian prisonersshould be brought to this country in 1944 (W.M. (43) 128th Conclusions,.Minute 1 (3)).2. There are at present some 74,900 Italian prisoners employed in this-country. As a result of the change in the status of Italian prisoners which will follow upon the signature of the agreement that is to be negotiated with theBadoglio Government, the conditions under which Italian prisoners can beemployed will be considerably altered. Departments will, therefore, be able tomake use of a far greater number of these prisoners. Indeed, it has been estimated, as a result of consultations held by the Ministry of Labour with userDepartments, that Departments could profitably employ some 250,000 prisonersover and above those already here.3. The number of Italian prisoners surplus to the requirements of thevarious theatres in which they are now held, and suitable for transfer to theUnited Kingdom, is far short of this total. I am informed by the War office that the numbers available for transfer are as follows : Theatre.f India&quot; X &quot; j Middle East     ......I North Africa and SicilyY &quot;East africa south AfricaGrand totalNumber available.20,0002,50010,00018,00022,50032,50040.50073,0004. In a recent note to the Chiefs of Staff Committee (C.O.S. (43) 319) the vice--Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported as follows in regard to, thepossibility of transporting these prisoners to this country :  &quot; (a) It appears possible to move the 32,500 at &quot; X &quot; above by distributingthem over the convoys arriving in the United Kingdom fromFebruary to May 1944.(b) The 40,500 at &quot; Y,&quot; however, will require a special allocation ofshipping; and, while it may be possible to move them so that theyarrive in the United Kingdom from July to September 1944, it is notpossible to give a firm indication at this stage.&quot;The Chiefs of Staff Committee considered this matter at their meeting on the30th December, 1943 (CCS. (43) 322nd Meeting (O), Item 1), and invited theWar Office and Ministry of War Transport (1) to proceed with the movement of 32,500 Italian prisoners  to  theUnited Kingdom as set out at (a) above, and[26747] -
(2) to review, prior to March 1944, the possibility of having a further40,500 Italian prisoners of war brought to the United Kingdom inaccordance with (b) above.5. Additional Italian prisoners of war can, of course, only be brought to thiscountry if preparations have been made to accommodate them. It is estimatedthat there are at present some 18,000 vacancies in&apos; existing camps and hostels, andthat suitable billets might be found for a further 1,000 prisoners. It is understoodthat the Service Departments could provide accommodation for considerable numbers of prisoners if they were allotted to them; and that the Ministry of Workscould accommodate some 4-5,000. In addition, it is possible that, as a resultof changes in the war situation, further accommodation evacuated by British and allied troops may become available during the summer. It must be realised, how-ever, that there will be considerable pressure upon the Service Departments to release any such accommodation for civilian purposes.6. It will be seen from the preceding paragraph that there is a good chance that it will be possible to house in existing accommodation at any rate the majorityof the 32,500 prisoners from India, the Middle East and North Africa and Sicily,and possibly also a proportion at least of the 40,500 whom it may be possible later to bring from East Africa and South Africa. It must be recognised, however,that much of this accommodation may be in places where the need tfor italian prisoners is not greatest, and some of it even in places where the prisoners arenot needed at all.7. It would appear, therefore, that three alternative courses of action are open to us : (a) To regulate the flow of Italian prisoners into this country and theirallocation between Departments in accordance with the availability ofexisting accommodation.(b) To embark on a new building programme adequate, together with existingknown vacancies, to accommodate at least the first 32,500 prisonerswhere they are most needed.(c) A combination of (a) and (b) i.e., to embark on a limited programme ofnew building and, for the rest, to proceed as at (a) above.8. The labour force for any programme of new building could, for the mostpart, be found from Italian prisoners already in this country or from those whoreach this country in the early months of this year but only at the cost of takingthem away from the work, mainly agricultural work, on which they are at present engaged. The Ministry of Works estimate that it takes a labour force of tenItalians and one British three months to build accommodation for ten italian prisoners.9. My own feeling is that, at this stage of the war, we should not be justifiedin using materials and labour for building new camps and hostels for italian prisoners of war; and that we should, therefore, adopt alternative (a) in para-graph 7 above. I should, however, be glad to know whether my colleagues sharethis view.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,18th January, 1944.
