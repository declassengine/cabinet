I. The Legend.It is evident that opinions on issues of post-war economic policy are greatly influenced by the view that is generally held both here and in the United Statesof the course of events in the inter-war period. In its cruder forms, this viewruns somewhat as follows : (1) The last war was followed by an outbreak of economic nationalism,involving a general heightening of tariff barriers, and the introductionof new and more disastrous obstacles to international trade, such asimport restrictions, exchange control, clearing agreements andbilateral bargaining.(2) There ensued as a natural consequence a huge decline in the volume ofinternational trade, which spelt unemployment for the industrial population of the depressed areas of Great Britain, ruinous prices forthe farmers of the New World, and impoverishment throughout theworld. It entailed a shocking waste of resources, illustrated by international restriction schemes, and the organised destruction ofcertain surplus crops.(3) The bilateral and discriminatory character of many of the new forms oftrade restriction worsened the international political atmosphere.The development of Imperial Preference entailed the closing of the open door in the British Colonial Empire. The system of clearingagreements destroyed the multilateral character of internationalcommerce, and led towards the formation of rival economic blocs. all this supplied the &quot; have not&quot; countries with a valid grievance, andhelped to spread the view that more &quot; living space &quot; under their direct control was essential to them. In this way the growth of trade barriersand discrimination was an underlying cause of the present war.(4) These deplorable tendencies developed in face of the advice andadmonitions of the farseeing and the internationally-minded,expressed in resolutions adopted at a series of international conferences at Geneva and elsewhere, directed to the lowering of trade barriers. But these resolutions were not embodied in binding inter-national agreements; nor were there any international economicinstitutions sufficiently comprehensive and powerful to ensure thatthey were followed up. Thus, although the wisdom of international economic liberalism was so manifest that most Governments wereconstrained to pay lip-service to it, the forces of economic nationalism,backed by selfish interests, prevailed.(5) The moral is that after the present war we must be more resolute andwhole-hearted than we were last time in our efforts to lower tariffs,to eliminate discrimination, and to extirpate the more vicious types of trade impediment; and that these efforts must be embodied inbinding international agreements and supported by appropriate inter-national institutions.The view which is thus summarised commands a remarkably Large measureof uncritical assent. It may. be taken as representing for practical purposes thequasi-official view of the present United States Administration. Indeed, the references to commercial policy made from time to time by leading Americanstatesmen consist largely of the enunciation of most of the propositions set out above. The same point of view is widely shared in Great Britain, where mindsare predisposed to accept it partly by the old Free Trade tradition and partly by the newer devotion to the League of Nations idea.The above is to be understood, of course, as a statement of the generally accepted view in its cruder and more popular versions. There are many who arein general sympathy with this view but who would regard the above statementof it as out of focus and who would think it essential to qualify it or to add to it. Two of the additions which would be most commonly made should be specially mentioned. Many, both in the United States and here, would attach a special degree of responsibility to the high-tariff policy of the United States,arguing that it is especially incumbent on a country which has acquired a strongcreditor position to take the lead in the direction of greater freedom. Otherswould add that the increase of trade barriers was partly attributable to a defectin the international monetary mechanism, which failed to provide enoughpurchasing power to sustain aggregate world demand at a sufficiently high level.These would draw the conclusion that a general reduction of trade barriers must
be accompanied by new arrangements designed to create &quot; expansionist &quot; monetaryconditions, both internationally and in the internal economies of the leadingcountries.Subject to these refinements, the view that has been described has attained the position of an established legend, by which current ideas on post-war policy are profoundly influenced. It is desirable, therefore, to consider how far it is supported by the facts.The inter-war period comprised four different phases : *(1) the phase of inflation and foreign exchange confusion, lasting from 1919until about 1925;(2) the phase of expansion and large-scale American lending, covering the later 1920s;(3) the phase of the world economic crisis from 1930 to about 1933;(4) the phase of partial recovery from 1933 until the outbreak of war.It is important to distinguish these various phases clearly from one another.It is particularly important to distinguish the first two, which cover roughly the1920s, from the second two which make up the 1930s.II. The Nineteen-Twenties.(a) General Characteristics.During the first phase international trade, particularly European trade, wasadversely affected by the conditions which have been designated as the essentialcharacteristics of the phase, namely inflation and foreign exchange confusion.Foreign exchange rates were subject to frequent and violent changes whichimposed heavy risks on either the importer or the exporter. Mr. Lloyd George,when Prime Minister, likened trading under these conditions to &apos;&apos; playingbilliards on an Atlantic liner.&quot; Still more serious was the fact that the runawayinflations which developed in several important European&apos; countries entailed,while they were in progress, a sharp decline in the foreign exchange resources ofthe countries affected, and consequently in their capacity to pay for imports. Thefall in exchange-rates during the course of these inflations kept far ahead of therise in internal prices and incomes; so that imported commodities became prohibi-tively expensive to the peoples of, for example, Austria, Poland, Germany, and later France.It was upon finding a remedy for these conditions that contemporary opinion and contemporary constructive effort were rightly concentrated. Apart from thespecial case of German Reparations, there was as yet no consciousness that thebalance of payments might have become a serious problem. It was taken for granted that the traditional mechanism of international exchange, if it could beset going again, had sufficient strength and elasticity to effect any quantitativeadjustments that might be needed, provided only that Germany&apos;s Reparationliabilities were kept within the bounds of reason. The accepted prescription wasthat governmental expenditure must be curtailed and budgets balanced, thatexchange rates must be stabilised, and that, to make this possible, Reparationobligations must be reduced, and external loans made available to countries whichneeded assistance. It was no easy task to carry out this programme; many f ormid-able obstacles stood in the way. But eventually after a lengthy series of efforts,which were marked by the close and cordial co-operation of. the Governors of theBank of England and of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with one another, and with, the economic and financial organisation of the League ofNations, the obstacles were surmounted one by one. The problem of GermanReparations was provisionally settled by the adoption of the Dawes Plan; inaddition to the Dawes Loan, which formed part of this plan, a series of Recon-struction Loans were raised for Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, and other european States; the internal finances of some of the more embarrassed of these states were brought under some degree of external control; budgets were balanced;and exchange rates were fixed by placing currencies again on a gold basis, sothat an effective &quot; multilateral &quot; system of external payment was restored. Theprocess was a gradual one, but in Central Europe it had been accomplished byabout 1925, though there were subsequent sharp depreciations in the currencies ofFrance, Belgium and Italy.
There followed the second phase namely, that of expansion and large-scaleAmerican lending. In Great Britain the essentially expansionist character ofthe later twenties was to some extent obscured by difficulties resulting from the over-high parity at which the gold standard was restored and from the failureof our old-established exporting industries to regain their pre-war markets.None the less, even in Great Britain, the volume of industrial productionincreased by 12 per cent, between 1924 and 1929, business profits were generallygood, and the standard of life improved materially. In the United States these were years of such rapid and sustained expansion in all forms of economic activity that the idea that the secret of continuing prosperity had been discovered, and that slumps were things of the past, and unemployment a diseaseof effete dole-giving countries, became extremely widespread. Incidentally, this idea contributed not a little to the final excesses of the Wall Street boom. Inother countries, also, production and economic activity went ahead. Expansion,in short, in the late 1920&apos;s was a world phenomenon.This expansion, it should be added, was by no means confined to increased production for internal markets. The volume of international trade also increased rapidly. According to the League of Nations Review of world production, 1925-32, the quantum of world trade increased by about 20 per cent,between 1924 and 1929, while the production of industrial goods rose by about one-quarter, and that of primary products by rather more than 10 per cent. this increase in international trade was associated with international financial conditions of a highly &quot; expansionist &quot; character. It had been one of the hopes of the Central Banking authorities and the League of Nations experts that thesuccess of their efforts to stabilise European currencies would pave the way fora revival of large-scale international lending, in which it was recognised thatthe American public must play a much larger part than hitherto. These hopeswere realised, though with consequences which were eventually as disconcertingas those which are proverbially apt to follow on the fulfilment of human wishes.The DaWes Loan and the League Reconstruction Loans served their purposes of&apos;&apos; priming the pump &apos;&apos;; the American investor was induced to buy foreign bondsby the most up-to-date methods of high-speed salesmanship; and financial institutions both in the United States and Great Britain lent substantial sums on short term to Central Europe.Thus the international financial conditions that prevailed in the late 1920&apos;were such as to supply an &apos;&apos; expansionist&apos;&apos; stimulus to international trade; andthe temporary increase in world trade that took place was doubtless partlyattributable to this cause.(b) Trade Restrictions.What influence did tariffs and other trade restrictions exert on the courseof international trade during the two phases that have been described? a country which is undergoing a runaway inflation, with exchange depreciationleading the way, will, of course, try to stop the rot by curtailing its imports. Forthis purpose tariffs are a clumsy instrument. The ad valorem equivalent of a specific duty is reduced by each fresh inflation of the price level; and it is impracticable to adjust the rates of duty sufficiently frequently to keep pace witha continuous inflationary process. Moreover, apart from this, the effects of duties on the volume of imports are always uncertain unless they are raised to prohibi-tive heights. A more precise and effective instrument lay ready to hand in anadaptation of the system of import licensing, which, together with exportlicensing, had been introduced during the war for various war-time reasons.During the inflationary phase of the early 1920s accordingly, import restrictions and import prohibitions were extensively employed by countries which were actually undergoing, or which felt themselves in danger of, a serious exchange depreciation.It would be palpably misleading to describe this development as a manifesta-tion of economic nationalism or of a desire for &quot; autarky,&quot; or even as an indication of insufficient faith in the virtues of economic liberalism.* Nocountry threatened by a disastrous fall in its rate of exchange can afford to allowits limited reserves of foreign exchange to be dissipated on unnecessary imports.The adoption of the technique of import restrictions was a matter of elementaryself-protection, almost, as it were, a reflex action to exchange difficulties which* &quot;It is a fact that ail Governments without exception were opposed to quantitative restrictions in principle and were anxious to return to pre-war trading methods as soon aspossible.&quot;   (Quantitative Trade Controls.--League of Nations, 1943.)
could not be ignored. Indeed, the valid criticism which can be brought againstthe Governments which imposed import restrictions during the early 1920s wasthat they did not sufficiently appreciate the need for more drastic action. Theycontrolled their imports by new and more effective quantitative methods; butthey shrank from the idea of exchange control. No effective restriction was placed on capital movements; privale individuals were left free to put their money abroad; and speculative &quot; bear &quot; transactions in exchange markets soonassumed a magnitude which rendered futile the attempts that were made tocontrol the more tangible transactions of international trade.This failure to introduce exchange control is attributable to a number ofcauses. First, the establishment of an effective system of exchange control isan extremely difficult administrative task. Second, the inevitable difficulties were aggravated by the political conditions of Europe in the early post-war years.The authority of many Governments was uncertain or weak; while, in the case ofGermany, there was a special difficulty arising from the occupation of the Rhine-land by Allied troops which created what Germans came to call the &apos;&apos; hole in theWest.&quot; But a third factor which undoubtedly played a part was the spell castby the tradition of economic liberalism, to which the idea of a State monopoly of foreign exchange transactions was then, and for long afterwards, peculiarlyrepugnant. Free trade theories, which were still dominant in Great Britain,found, it is true, only limited support in Continental Europe; but a belief infreedom of enterprise, in free markets and in economic liberalism generally madea much wider appeal, and formed part of the workaday philosophy of european governments. This, it may be observed, was one reason why it was so easyin the inter-war period to persuade international conferences to pass resolutionsstrongly condemnatory of the newer types of trade impediment.None the less, the logic of events was not without its effect on responsibleopinion in the countries which experienced runaway inflations. The convictiontook root that in times of monetary crisis it is no less essential to control the movements of money and capital than to control the movement of goods. Thiswas to bear fruit later. In the meantime the remedy was found, as indicated above, in the policy sponsored by the League of Nations and the Central Banks,and in the large-scale international lending that ensued.During the second phase, when there was no longer an atmosphere ofexchange crisis, the import restrictions which had been imposed earlier were either removed altogether, as in Germany and Hungary, or greatly relaxed^Poland was the only country to introduce new import restrictions during thisphase, and inasmuch as her currency and exchange position was still precarious,she may be regarded as the exception which in the strict sense &quot; proves the rule.&quot;Nor were any other new types of trade impediment introduced in this phase.The gold standard was restored throughout the greater part of the world. thus in the later 1920s the essential features of the &quot;free&quot; international economic system, as it existed before 1914, had been largely restored. There remained, itis true, the time-honoured impediment of tariffs; and, in the words of the Reportof the World Economic Conference of 1927, tariffs were &quot;higher and more complicated, less stable and more numerous than in 1913.&quot;This Conference was the most important and impressive attempt made in the1920s to secure freer trade by international agreement. It recommended thecomplete suppression, subject to minor exceptions, of all forms of quantitativetrade regulation. But it concentrated its main attention upon tariffs, as thechief remaining trade impediment. Its recommendations were summed up in thefollowing declaration, which won considerable renown at the time : &quot; The Conference declares that the time has come to put an end to theincrease in tariffs and to move in the opposite direction.&quot;The proceedings of the 1927 Conference were exceptionally harmonious, andits resolutions unusually unqualified and vigorous in tone. Its recommendations were adopted unanimously by the League Assembly, and endorsed by no less than twenty-nine Governments in specific declarations. They were also blessed bythe International Chamber of Commerce, with a call to Governments to act upon them. Tariffs were not reduced as a consequence; on the contrary, in a fewcountries tariffs were further increased.   None the less, as is said in the League* &quot;In the course of the next three or four years (after 1925) restrictions of this kind weregradually whittled&apos; down. They no longer represented the main obstacles to internationalexchanges in Europe, and were mild compared with the restrictions that developed in the &apos;30s.But they were still far from being inconsiderable or unimportant.&apos;&apos; (Quantitative Trade Controls.League of Nations, 1943.)
of Nations Survey of Commercial Policy, 1919-39, &quot; the Conference was in factfollowed by a certain stabilisation of the world tariff position.&quot; In other words,the trend towards higher tariffs was virtually checked until the occurrence ofthe world economic crisis. It is not every international conference that achievesas much. Alike in the vigour of its resolutions, and the cordiality of their reception, the World Economic Conference of 1927 represented the high-watermark of economic liberalism in the inter-war period.Two other points should be noted. First, the trend towards higher tariffsuntil 1927 represented in part the adjustment of specific duties to higher price-levels; and the effective increase of tariffs was not as great as is sometimessupposed. Second, by virtue of the most-favoured-nation clause, which was a feature of most commercial treaties, tariff systems were, speaking broadly, non-discriminatory, in the sense which that phrase usually carries. imperial preference had not in the 1920s been introduced to any important extent into the fiscal system of the United Kingdom. Thus the commercial arrangements of the later 1920s gave substantial effect to the principle of non-discrimination.(c) Summary.To sum up the story, so far as it has been carried, the difficulties of inter-national trade in the first post-war phase were chiefly due to the collapse ofcurrencies and the confusion of exchanges. The import restrictions that were then imposed were imposed reluctantly and as a matter of elementary self-protection by Governments which disliked them. In the second post-war phase,when the atmosphere of exchange crisis had been temporarily removed by inter-national&apos; loans and credits, these import restrictions were largely removed orwhittled down. Although tariffs were higher than before 1914, their upward movement was virtually checked by 1927, and they paid substantially full regardto the principle of &quot; non-discrimination.&quot; Apart from tariffs and the import restrictions that remained, there was no other serious trade impediment.Expedients such as exchange clearing systems, payments agreements, and&quot; barter&quot; trade agreements were unknown. Exchange-rates were stabilised. Asystem of multilateral payments had apparently been effectively re-established,with the aid of large-scale international lending which served to supply an&quot;expansionist&quot; monetary environment. The later 1920s were emphatically nota phase of economic nationalism or of contractionism. On the contrary, theywere marked by a serious and sustained effort to recreate an expanding inter-national trade on the basis of a freely-working multilateral system.For some years all seemed to go well. A large expansion of international trade in fact took place. International hopes ran high in the political, no lessthan in the economic sphere. The Locarno Pact was signed, and the Rhinelandwas evacuated. These hopes were dashed as a consequence of the world economiccrisis which ushered in the third post-war phase. It was then that the trend towards economic liberalism was reversed, that international trade was seriouslycurtailed and was subjected to all manner of new impediments. But these developments were the direct outcome of the world economic crisis; and the fore-going narrative reveals no reason for attributing the crisis to economicnationalism or to trade restrictions.III. The World Economic Crisis.(a) The Monetary Breakdown.It is unnecessary to attempt a comprehensive diagnosis of the causes of the troubles which began at the end of 1929, or to assign to each of the various factors its due importance. Trade depressions, of greater or less severity, have occurred periodically throughout modern economic history, and a large literaturehas been devoted to attempts to elucidate their causes. But this particulardepression was catastrophic beyond all precedent. For this it can be argued that much responsibility attaches to particular developments in the internal economic life of particular countries; notably to the unrestrained Stock Exchange specula-tion in the later 1920s in the United States, which accentuated the fluctuations ineffective purchasing-power. From the external economic standpoint, however,the outstanding fact was the collapse of the whole mechanism of the internationalgold standard system which had been laboriously reconstructed a few years earlier; and the question which has here to be considered is why this collapseoccurred.
Its immediate cause was that, when the flow of American lending ceased,most countries in Central and Eastern Europe and Central and South Americabecame unable to meet their financial obligations to the outside world. At the root of this inability lay the fact that these countries had been living during thesecond phase with a balance of payments on current account which was persis-tently and heavily adverse. The sums, that is to say, which they were liable topay to other countries in respect ,of their imports, interest on loans, or in somecases for Reparations obligations, greatly exceeded the sums that were due tothem in respect of their exports. They had been meeting the difference by borrowing. The large-scale international lending had thus served for the timebeing to cover up their unbalanced position. It had supplied a breathing-space;but this had not been used to restore equilibrium.The difficulties of the debtor countries of Europe in meeting their external financial obligations were greatly aggravated by attempts on the part of creditorsabroad to withdraw their money, by attempts on the part of their own nationalsto put money abroad and by &apos;&apos; bear &apos;&apos; movement against their currencies in theforeign exchange markets. &quot;Runs&quot; were made upon the currency of one country after another, rather like the runs on banks that used to cause an internalbanking crisis. During 1931 these runs gained a strong momentum; and thecountries on which they were made found themselves faced with an imminent danger that their reserves of gold and foreign exchange would be completelyexhausted.Countries in this position had to choose between two courses; exchange depreciation or exchange restrictions. They could suspend gold payments, and allow their currencies to be bought and sold on the foreign exchange markets for what they would fetch. In that event they must be ready to see their currenciesdepreciate to an extent which could not be measured in advance. Alternativelythey could restrict dealings in foreign exchange, and continue to supply gold or foreign exchange for their currencies for &quot; approved &apos;&apos; transactions only. In that case they must develop an elaborate system of exchange control. In either case,international trade was likely to suffer. That, however, could not be helped. the dilemma was inescapable. No degree of enlightened broadmindedness could have enabled a Government or Central Bank to supply gold freely in exchange for itsdomestic currency when all its gold was gone. Nor would it have been prudent to wait until its reserves were actually exhausted before taking action, though this was very nearly what Great Britain did in 1931.It was only natural that European countries which had undergone runawayinflations during the early 1920s should regard exchange control as the lesser ofthe two evils. An outstanding feature of those inflations, as observed above, wasthat the fall of the exchange rates had led the way, keeping well ahead of therise in internal prices, and making further internal inflation unavoidable. in central European eyes, accordingly, inflation and exchange depreciation had become virtually synonymous terms of terrible significance. In 1931, the danger that what happened before might happen again was real and pressing. The sameforces were at work; money was flying abroad in panic, and speculators were&quot;bearing&quot; currencies with gusto. It seems improbable in these circumstances that another phase of runaway inflation would have been avoided if dealings inforeign exchange had remained unrestricted.For exchange control, on the other hand, the inflationary experiences of thefirst post-war phase had done much to prepare the ground. They had shown thata currency rot cannot be stopped, without controlling the external movements ofmoney; and they had stimulated thought upon the most effective means of control-ling them. Meanwhile, the Allied evacuation of the Rhineland had removed thespecial German difficulty of the &apos;&apos; hole in the west.&apos;&apos;It was no less natural that Great Britain, when the pound in due coursebecame the subject of a powerful &quot; bear &quot; attack, should prefer the other horn ofthe dilemma. The traditions of London as a financial centre, in which foreignerswere accustomed to deposit large balances on the understanding that they couldwithdraw them readily on the shortest notice, were enough in Great Britain inSeptember, 1931, to make the idea of exchange control unthinkable. On the otherhand, we had not suffered before from a runaway inflation, and our international financial position was still strong enough to make any such development most improbable.The fall of the pound was, of course, a painful shock to public opinion.Nothing could be further from the truth than to suppose that a sense of the competitive advantages which our industries might obtain in world markets fromexchange depreciation played any part in Great Britain&apos;s departure from the
sgold standard. We went off gold, because we were driven off. In the attemptto remain on, we had borrowed as much money as we could from the UnitedStates and France at high rates of interest, and we had adopted a policyof budgetary retrenchment so drastic as to provoke a political crisis, the formationof a National Government, and a General Election. At this election, the menaceof inflation was one of the leading themes; and for a few months the possibility that the chances of the exchange, markets might cause the pound to fall indefinitelyremained a matter of genuine anxiety to the British financial authorities. but such warnings and worries were quite different from the Central European sense of the imminence of catastrophe.In several countries, especially in South America, both expedients were employed. They allowed their exchange-rates to fall, and when this fall wentso fa/as to become alarming, they had recourse to exchange restrictions as well.Meanwhile some countries, notably the United States, France, Holland, belgium and Switzerland, had no difficulty in maintaining their exchange parities; for it was to them that the funds moved that were being withdrawn from othercountries.There thus grew up a great diversity in the international monetary sphere,in place of the essential uniformity which was secured by the gold standard.In 1932 the countries of the world could be classified from the foreign exchangestandpoint under four broad headings (1) the genuine gold standard countries;(2) the &quot; pseudo-gold &quot; countries, i.e., those which maintained their nominalparities with gold by an elaborate system of exchange control;(3) the sterling area, which strictly covered only those parts of the BritishCommonwealth which kept their monetary reserves in the form of sterling balances, but which could be regarded more loosely as including various foreign countries, notably in Scandinavia, whichhad decided to &quot; peg &quot; their currencies on sterling;(4) the remaining countries, where heavy exchange depreciation wascombined  IS cl rule with exchange restrictions.(b) The Growth of Trade Restrictions.This foreign exchange situation was detrimental in various ways to inter-national trade as hitherto conducted; and it gave a powerful impetus to theerection of fresh trade barriers. In countries which adopted exchange control,the system was usually such as to constitute in itself a formidable impedimentto imports. An importer could only obtain foreign exchange to pay for foreigngoods at the discretion of the exchange-control authorities; and in practiceforeign exchange was only made available for a greatly reduced volume ofimports. This is not in all circumstances an inevitable feature of exchange control. Under the arrangements that have been evolved in Great Britain andthe sterling area during the war, exchange control is used in order to regulatecapital movements only; foreign exchange is supplied freely for commercialtransactions, and imports are regulated by other means. But the shortage of monetary resources in the countries that had recourse to exchange control roundabout 1931 was such that it was not enough for them to prevent a flight of capital.They had also to correct an adverse balance of payments on current account, andto correct it quickly; and they used exchange control as the most efficient andmost flexible instrument for this purpose.In short, under drastic systems of exchange control in their earliest phases,the extent to which foreign exchange was made available to defray imports was determined by arbitrary, ad hoc, day to day decisions in the light of the resources available. . Gradually, as it became possible to look further ahead, import programmes were planned on a basis corresponding more nearly to a system of import restrictions; none the less the regulation of imports was still treated asa subordinate branch of exchange control. This, it may be suggested, is inprinciple the proper way to treat import restrictions that are imposed forexchange or balance of payments reasons, as distinct from those designed toprotect particular industries.In countries which underwent exchange depreciations, the fall of exchange rates served as an impediment to imports; and it was usually followed by highertariffs. As has already been said, the British authorities were worried about their capacity to check an undue fall of sterling for several months after ourdeparture from, the gold standard.   To improve the balance of payments seemed
in those circumstances an urgent objective of policy; and this consideration was an important factor, though not the only one, in the introduction of a generaltariff in 1932. This step led on to others. The ban which the Free Tradetradition had hitherto imposed on the extension of Imperial Preference wasremoved, and there followed the arrangements of the Ottawa Conference of 1932,and the introduction in large parts of the colonial empire of preferences infavour of British goods, and &quot; quotas &quot; designed to check the increase of importsfrom Japan. It should be noted in passing that the Japanese had invadedManchuria long before this development occurred.The intensification of trade restrictions in the phase of the world economiccrisis was, however, by no means confined to countries which had an adverse balance of payments or which were short of monetary reserves. On the contrary,the two countries which absorbed most of the gold that other countries werelosing, namely, the United States and France, played a leading and early part inthe process. In 1930 the United States adopted the Hawley-Smoot Act, whichraised the American tariff to the highest level in its prevailingly high tariffhistory. Early in 1931 France introduced a system of import licensing, coveringcereals and certain other food-stuffs, and a few months later took the lead inextending this system to non-agricultural products. Stimulated by theseexamples, tariff increases soon became the rule throughout the world, andquantitative import restrictions became widespread throughout Europe.The Hawley-Smoot tariff, following the reversal of the flow of Americanlending, and adopted in despite of a strongly favourable United States balanceof payments, was a glaring example of ian action diametrically Counter to worldneeds. This is fully recognised in retrospect by Americn opinion. Perhaps,indeed, the sense that this measure was indefensible from the standpoint of inter-national good behaviour may have encouraged some exaggeration of the influence which it exerted. &quot; Our people,&quot; said Mr. Cordell Hull in 1940, &quot; are not likelyto forget the contribution which the enactment of the 1930 Tariff Act made tothe intensification of economic warfare among nations, to the growth of trade barriers, to the vicious spirals of resentment, ill will and retaliation.&quot;Undoubtedly the Hawley-Smoot tariff aggravated the difficulties of othercountries. But, before it became operative, the world depression, though it hadnot yet reached its nadir, had already assumed catastrophic proportions; and itis improbable in the extreme that the international monetary breakdown could have been avoided, or that the subsequent story would have been materiallydifferent, if the American tariff had been left unchanged.Moreover, the Hawley-Smoot tariff, though it was quite unjustified by anybalance of payments reasons, was none the less an outcome of the depression. its object was to check the growth of unemployment and the formidable fall ofcommodity prices in the United States. Similar considerations were responsiblefor the raising of tariffs and other trade obstacles in other countries which couldplead no international financial difficulties. From the international standpointsuch actions were undeniably &quot; self-regarding.&quot; In retrospect it has becomecommon to describe them as attempts &quot; to export unemployment.&quot; It is certainlyto be desired, and perhaps it is not extravagant to hope, that a greater regard for the general world interest will exercise a restraining influence on such actsin future. Even here, however, due measure should be observed in passingcensures and prescribing rules. It may be illegitimate and anti-social for a country to attempt to &quot;export&quot; its unemployment; but it cannot reasonably beexpected to &quot; import &quot; it uncomplainingly. In practice, under conditions of depression, it is difficult to define the point at which protective measures passfrom an attempt to check the import of unemployment to an attempt to forceits export.Until the fall of the pound in September 1931 the United Kingdom studiouslyrefrained during the world depression from placing any fresh obstacle in theway of imports. Under the prevailing conditions of falling prices and wagereductions in competing industrial countries, this led not only to a seriousweakening of our national balance of payments, but to the importation ofunemployment on a substantial scale. Only the still potent force of the free trade tradition made it possible for us to acquiesce in this state of affairs aslong as we did; and having regard to the increasing importance attached tostability, economic security and &quot;full employment,&quot; it seems very doubtfulwhether any country could be expected to &quot;import unemployment&quot; sounresistingly in future.
Measures of agricultural protection were especially prominent among thetrade restrictions imposed for reasons of internal stability. It was, indeed, mainlyagricultural commodities that were the subject of the quantitative import restric-tions that were so widely imposed during 1931 even by countries which were inno international financial difficulty. This development sprang from the fact thatan abnormally severe slump of agricultural prices was an outstanding feature of the world depression, and threatened the stability of the agricultural systems of food-importing countries. The collapse of agricultural prices was important in another way. It played a considerable part in the disequilibrium in the balanceof international payments, the causes of which have still to be examined.(c) The Balance of Payments.The disequilibrium in the balance of payments, as has already beensuggested, lay at the root of the international monetary breakdown. It was con-concealed for some time by the large-scale flow of international lending, but became apparent when this flow was reversed,A major factor in the disequilibrium was the radical change which the war of1914-18 had brought about in international debtor-creditor relations. The UnitedStates, hitherto a debtor country, emerged from the war as a substantial creditor.Her nationals had acquired a large portion of the American securities previouslyheld by foreigners. Her Government had large debts owing to her from theGovernments of the European Allies, together with a claim to a share ofGerman Reparation payments. Germany was stripped of her capital assets over-seas and of her mercantile marine; her position was further weakened by territoriallosses, and she was made subject to heavy Reparation liabilities. Great Britain&apos;overseas investments were materially reduced, though they still remained large;and her Government had contracted a substantial war debt to the Government ofthe United States. France, though victorious in the war, emerged in an eco-nomically weak, condition. Traditionally, she had been one of the great lendingcountries, but her loans in the generation preceding the war had been directedpreponderantly to financing her ally Russia, and with the advent of the SovietGovernment to power, these securities became worthless.The war also left a lasting mark on the structure of international trade whichaggravated the consequences of the change in debtor-creditor relations. TheLancashire cotton industry lost ground in Far Eastern markets, which it was never able to regain, partly to Japan and partly to local Indian production. Inthe automobile industry, at a critical phase of its development, British manu-facturers, who had already got somewhat slowly off the mark, were put several years behind by the diversion of engineering to munitions. Thus, alike in oldand in new lines of trade, the war dealt enduring injury to British exports, whichin the later 1920s had to carry the handicap of an over-valued pound. In Germanyand Central Europe broadly similar disadvantages (except for the over-valuedpound) were accentuated by the dislocating effects of &quot;defeat, revolution and the currency confusion of the early post-war phase. On the other hand, the waropened out new opportunities for Japan, and gave a stimulus to the exportindustry of the United States, which had already been making significant progress on the basis of the solid advantages of inventive pre-eminence and the largesthome market in the world.These influences combined to produce the following broad results on theinternational balance of payments during the 1920s. At the one end of the scale,the United States had a large favourable balance. At the other end, Germanyand. Central Europe had a heavy adverse balance. In the middle was GreatBritain with a balance which remained on the right side until the world economiccrisis, but without the huge favourable margin which had previously enabledLondon to act as the chief centre for new loans.The general disequilibrium of the international balance of paymentscomprised, however, another major factor of profound significance. Thosecountries which specialised in the production of agricultural commodities for world markets were among the first to undergo an exchange crisis. Prominentamong them were Argentina, Brazil, and indeed most of the South Americancommunities, Australia and. New Zealand in the British Commonwealth, and inthe Old World the countries of East-Central Europe. Their exchange difficulties were a consequence of the abnormally heavy fall of agricultural prices whichmarked the onset of the world depression. This served to derange the balance ofpayments of countries whose exports consisted mainly of agricultural products,and led inevitably in many cases to exchange depreciation and financial default.
The severe slump of agricultural prices thus played an important part in theinternational monetary breakdown. It was some time before the significance ofthis development was fully appreciated; indeed it is doubtful if it is generallyappreciated even yet. Trade depressions had always been recurrent phenomena;and in every trade depression the prices of agricultural commodities had fallenmore than those of manufactured goods. This made it natural to assume that theunusually heavy fall round about 1930 was merely an indication of the abnormalseverity of the depression        whole.(d) A agricultural Surplus Capacity.In the nineteenth century, however, though gluts of agricultural commoditiesmight occur from time to time, they were only temporary, and, soon gave place to conditions of excess demand which led to the opening up of new productive areas.The essential fact before 1914 was that the world demand for most agricultural commodities increased, year in and year out, more rapidly than could be met,under the existing conditions of agricultural technique, from the existing areasof supply. But in the 1930s it became apparent not only that new productiveareas were no longer needed, but that the existing areas could, sustain an outputwhich for many commodities was far larger than the world&apos;s demand, and whichtended under the influence of technical progress to increase at least as fast. Aprevailing excess of supply over demand had indeed become evident in the 1920s.It was &apos;&apos; taken care of &apos;&apos; for a time by pooling schemes, and other devices for holding surplus stocks off the market, in the vain hope that the condition of over-supply might prove only temporary.  This, of course, aggravated the trouble later.There emerged, in short, the essentially new phenomenon of a persistentexcess of productive capacity in many branches of world agriculture. There are many who would dispute the view that the persistence of this excess was in any sense inevitable; they would attribute it mainly to the growth of agriculturalprotection in the importing countries of Europe. In the light of the actualsequence of events, this diagnosis seems both inadequate and somewhat superficial.The accumulation of agricultural surpluses and the collapse of agricultural pricespreceded any marked general increase in agrarian protection. It. was in orderto safeguard their agricultural systems from the dislocation which the slump in world prices seemed to threaten that European countries, other than Italy, firstintroduced new protective measures. Once this movement had begun, indeed,it went further than the original purpose warranted; many continental countriescut down their agricultural imports drastically; and the world problem wasthereby gravely aggravated. Vicious circles of this kind often complicate thecourse of economic development, and make it more difficult to disentangle causeand effect.It is clear, however, that behind the excess of world agricultural capacitylay other and more fundamental factors. The rate of technical progress inagriculture, which throughout the nineteenth century was far less rapid than in manufacturing industry, was rapidly speeded up in the present century. in successive branches of agriculture, output per acre, and output per individualincreased significantly, as the result partly of discoveries in the fields of chemicaland biological research and partly of mechanisation. This development served,of course, to reduce costs of production, and thus enabled farmers to sustain asubstantial fall in the relative prices of agricultural commodities. But it alsohelped to create conditions of excess supply, which drove prices down below aremunerative level. This quickened rate of technical progress was accompaniedby another trend, which told in the same direction, namely, the slowing-down ofthe rates of population growth in the Western industrial countries, which were,the chief importers of agricultural commodities.The redundancy of agricultural capacity exerted far-reaching repercussions on the international economic system. It was probably an important independentcause of the world depression, as well as of the international monetary breakdownthat ensued. It set in motion, as has been suggested, the trend towards increasedagricultural protection and self-sufficiency in Europe. It played a special part inthe evolution of the Ottawa system of Imperial Preference. It led directly toattempts to maintain remunerative prices by means of international commodityregulation schemes. It gave new strength and insistence to the desire for greaterindustrialisation in countries wdiich had hitherto specialised in exportagriculture. Finally it was a major cause of the collapse, in default, fraud anduniversal disillusion, of the system of large-scale international lending.
(e) The Collapse of International Lending.In the freely-working economic system of the nineteenth century, inter-national lending played a prominent role. Indeed no part of that system receivedso much praise from contemporary observers, or seemed to supply so good an illustration of the favourite theme of a natural harmony between enlightenedself-interest and the common good. It was not suggested that a man whosubscribed to an overseas loan did so out of public spirit; none the less theconsequences were of benefit to the whole world. By means of such loans,machinery or railway equipment was exported from Great Britain, where itcould be produced most cheaply, to new countries where it could be put to themost advantageous use. The annual output of food and raw materials in the newcountries was thereby largely increased; and these commodities were thenexported to Great Britain, partly by way of loan interest and partly in exchange for manufactured consumers&apos; goods. This was to the advantage of the mass of.people in the borrowing and the lending countries alike. It gave the former ashare in the benefits of the industrial revolution. It opened out for the latter away round the barriers which the law of population and the law of diminishingreturns from land had seemed in the age of Malthus to place in the path of socialprogress.Thus international lending bore a good name; and it did not seem unreason-able in the 1920s to hope that it might play a helpful part in post-war reconstruction. The revival of international lending became accordingly one ofthe main objectives of economic statesmanship. It was recognised, as has alreadybeen noted, that the lending must be related to a favourable balance of payments on current account, and that the United States must therefore step into theforemost ranks of the lending countries. This object was attained in a degreewhich for a time surpassed the most optimistic expectations.The methods by which it was attained were open, however, to much criticism; and it became common to lay the blame upon these methods whendisaster overtook a large proportion of the foreign bonds which Americaninvestors had *been induced to buy. Americans, in particular, are prone toattribute the trouble to their national lack of experience in foreign lending. here again, however, it is open to question whether their self-censure is not excessive.Many of the foreign bond issues which in the light of our after-knowledge seemmost unwise did not seem so in the 1920s even to cautious financial minds.The main causes of the trouble lay much deeper in the disequilibrium of thebalance of payments which has been analysed above. An essential condition ofthe tolerably smooth functioning of international lending in the nineteenth century was that it facilitated an increased output by the borrowing countries of commodities for which there was a rapidly expanding world demand. So longas this condition was fulfilled, the subsequent payment of interest and sinking-fund charges gave rise to no &quot; transfer &quot; problem or foreign exchange difficulty.But the international lending of the 1920s did not fulfil this condition. It wasto cover a heavily adverse balance of payments that the European borrowingcountries raised loans abroad. The capacity of the South American borrowers todischarge their obligations was destroyed by the saturation of the world market for agricultural commodities.It is not surprising, therefore, that a substantial proportion of the Europeanbonds and a much larger proportion (reaching about 90 per cent.) of the latin american bonds raised in the United States during the 1920s should have gone into default. This experience killed stone-dead the short-lived vogue of american foreign lending; and for several years after 1931, through the medium of the purchase of American securities in Wall Street, the United States became a substantial net importer of long-term capital. British foreign investments also suffered seriously from default; and the consequential reluctance of London tcundertake new foreign issues was reinforced by the anxieties of the Britishmonetary authorities about the stability of sterling.If the results of the international lending of the 1920s were unpalatable tothe lenders, it must not be supposed that the borrowers found them satisfactory.The role of a defaulter is invidious; and most debtor countries struggled hard to avoid it, some successfully; all were concerned to defend their currenciesagainst undue depreciation. The obligation to pay large sums across theexchanges as interest on their external debts was an important element in theirexchange difficulties; and the sense of the burden of such obligations grewaccordingly. This feeling added fuel to the resentment which had long beenlatent in borrowing countries against the control of public utilities or other
important local enterprise by foreign capital. Tints -the world economic crisisleft behind it in lending and borrowing countries alike a state of mind profoundlyantagonistic to international lending at any rate of the traditional types.The broad question arises whether the good name of international lendingin the nineteenth century did not depend largely on conditions which have nowpassed away, on the slow rate of progress of agricultural technique and on the rapid rate of growth of the populations of industrial countries, which togethermade the opening up of new food-producing areas one of the world&apos;s vital needs;There will doubtless be scope in future for international investment in new formsand directed- to the purpose of the industrialisation of the less developed countries. It seems improbable, however, that such international investmentcould supply, as did the lending of the nineteenth century, the main lubricant ofan automatic, self-adjusting system.(f) Summary.Under the strain of a severe trade depression which began in the latter partof 1929, the international economic system which had been laboriously recreatedin the 1920s broke down. The mutilateral payments system provided by generaladherence to the gold standard, the comparatively liberal trend of commercialpolicies, the lubricant of large-scale international lending, all disappeared. Thequantum of world trade fell by about one-fourth between 1929 and 1932.The chief moral to which this breakdown points is the essentially fair-weather character of an international economic system based on the free play of market forces, qualified by tariffs. When equilibrium already exists, marketforces may suffice to correct small departures from it. In the 1920s, however,there were large maladjustments to correct; maladjustments in the internationalbalance of payments, maladjustments between demand and supply for importantagricultural commodities. In part these maladjustments were the result of changes brought about by the war of 1914-18. In part they may have reflectedmore deep-seated changes, which deprived international lending of its historicraison d&apos;etre. In either case, they called for readjustments in production and inthe flow of trade, which proved to be beyond the compass of the automaticresponses of an unregulated system.IV. The Gropings of the Nineteen-Thirties.(a) Deliberate Exchange Depreciation.The bottom point of the depression, taking the world as a whole, was reached in 1932; but for some time thereafter recovery was extremely slow. Bad trade,unemployment and agricultural distress were the main preoccupations of publicopinion throughout the world, and they carried an obvious threat, which actuallyproved fatal in many countries, to the stability of the social structure and thepolitical regime. Different Governments accordingly felt constrained to experi-ment with various new types of policy in the effort to stimulate recovery, withoutpaying much regard to the repercussions of their actions upon their neighbours.It was in these circumstances that many of the practices which are now the subjectof particular censure were evolved.One of the most startling of these experiments was the deliberate deprecia-tion of the dollar by the United States in 1933. The gold-value of the dollarwas forced down by more than 40 per cent, by means of a series of measures which included an increase in the buying price offered for gold at the mints. Thispolicy, adopted in face of the vast American gold reserves, was something entirely new in monetary history. The first announcement of it fell with shattering effect upon the World Monetary and Economic Conference which had just opened its proceedings in London, and which had been called to consider, among other problems, the stabilisation of currencies. It seems to have been largely inspired by a crude statistical generalisation to the effect that the price-level variedproportionately to the price of gold, which received at the time great publicity in the United States, and commended itself to President Roosevelt as anhypothesis worth testing. But another important influence was a sense of theadvantages which Great Britain and other sterling countries had derived fromthe fall of the pound in 1931, coupled with a suspicion that we were trying totransfer our share of the burden of depression on to American shoulders by meansof our newly instituted Exchange Equalisation Eund.
The idea that the British departure from the gold standard was influenced by a desire to devalue the pound is entirely baseless. We were driven off gold,despite strenuous efforts to remain on. None the less, we soon found that the fall of the exchange brought substantial compensations with it; and the sense that the over-valued pound of the later 1920s had been an incubus of which we were wellrid became general. For several months, as has been seen above, the weakness of the pound was a source of serious anxiety to the British monetary authorities.But early in 1932 the tide of market forces turned, and the pound began to recover rapidly. When this happened, British opinion was quick to realise that greatly as it had disliked the original depreciation, it would dislike evenmore a return to the former parity. It was in these circumstances that theExchange Equalisation Fund was established, with the object of mitigating thefluctuations of exchange rates.Inasmuch as the Fund accumulated substantial reserves of gold and foreign exchange over the next few years, it is clear that it was used predominantly tokeep the pound down rather than to keep it up. This does not mean that theBritish authorities were pursuing a policy of competitive exchange depreciation,a purpose which they consistently disavowed. There were solid grounds for the belief that the pound had been overvalued between 1925 and 1931; and during thedepression wage rates had been cut far more drastically in competing industrial countries than in Great Britain, both before and after September 1931. In thesecircumstances, a return of the pound to its former parity could have afforded nostable basis for international trade. The same largely speculative market forces which had pulled the pound down and were now pushing it up again might at any moment pull it down once more. To try for some sort of stability at a lower level seemed, therefore, the course of wisdom. Nor did it seem unreasonable oranti-social that we should take the opportunity to replenish our monetary reserves,which had been virtually exhausted when we suspended gold payments.In the meantime, however, other countries had observed with differentfeelings&apos;the fact which had so impressed British opinion, namely that the fall ofthe pound had been a positive relief to us. During the 1920s a fall of a country&apos;sexchange-rates had been the signal for the commencement of an inflationaryprocess, involving the vicious spiral of prices and wages chasing one another,and sometimes culminating in an uncontrollable degringolade. Many Continentalobservers expected that the fall of the pound would be followed by a similarinflationary process in Great Britain. The sequel was disconcertingly different.British prices rose hardly at all; prices in gold standard countries underwent asharper fall, and there could be little doubt that the depreciation of the pound wasin part responsible for this. In Great Britain and the sterling area trade ceasedat any rate to get much worse. Elsewhere depression deepened alarmingly. TheBritish seemed to have contrived to transfer its brunt to other shoulders; andhaving regard to the indisputable fact that the Exchange Equalisation Fund was used predominantly to keep the pound down rather than to keep it up, it was onlynatural that the British policy should arouse suspicion and resentment and theimpulse to retaliate.The memories of inflation were too vivid in the principal continental countries to tempt them to follow our example; but it was otherwise in the UnitedStates, where there were no such memories and where monetary heretics alwaysfind a ready ear. The desire to counter the depreciation of the pound was there-fore one of the main influences which prompted the intrinsically very differentpolicy of the deliberate devaluation of the dollar. It may be noted that in authorising the President to devalue the dollar, Congress declared that the extentof the devaluation should be such &quot; as he (the President) finds necessary from hisinvestigation to stabilise domestic prices or to protect the foreign commerceagainst the adverse effect of depreciated foreign currencies.&quot;The devaluation of the dollar exerted disastrous reactions upon the economies of those countries which still maintained their gold parities, on the basis of free, or largely free, convertibility. These countries were now reduced to France,Belgium, Holland, Switzerland and Czecho-Slovakia. The exchange-rates oftheir currencies with the dollar were forced up by two-thirds, and their exchange-rates with sterling, since the British authorities strove to avert a similar apprecia-tion of the pound, also increased materially. Thus the currencies of the gold Hocbecame heavily &apos;&apos; over-valued &apos;&apos;; their producers were placed at a serious disadvan-tage in international competition, and it became necessary for them to choose between devaluing themselves or undertaking a severe deflation. Despite themanifest difficulties attendant on the latter course the former was ruled out forthe time being by an overwhelming force of public prejudice, which was especially
strong in France. Belgium fell out of the ranks fairly soon, but the remaininggold countries continued to cling to their parities for more than three years afterthe devaluation of the dollar.Meanwhile internal deflation, though insufficiently drastic to restoreequilibrium, was carried far enough to provoke increasing discontent; and thiswas an important factor in the electoral triumph of the Popular Front in france in 1936. M. Blum assumed office with a programme of social experiment, whichwas clearly incompatible with the maintenance of an over-valued frame; Frenchcitizens put their money abroad in increasing volume; and after a few months ofvacillation the-&quot; decision to devalue the franc was taken in September 1936. Therealignment of the remaining gold currencies soon followed.The devaluation of the French franc was accompanied by simultaneousdeclarations by the Governments of France, Britain and the United States, which became known as the Tripartite Agreement. In fact, these declarations containednothing of substance beyond a general assurance that the devaluation of the francwould not be made the occasion for a fresh depreciation of the dollar or the pound.There was no arrangement for positive co-operation. None the less, the assurancementioned was of some significance as marking an agreement to avoid for thefuture any competition in exchange depreciation.In the preceding years there had seemed at times to be some danger that acompetition of this sort might go far and spread wide. It was evident that if twoCountries were to set out to regulate the exchange-rate between their currencies byunilateral action, each being resolved to avoid an over-valued currency for itself,any difference of view between them as to what the exchange-rate ought to bewould logically involve a collision of policy from which a competition in deprecia-tion might easily result. The positions of the United States and the UnitedKingdom did not seem very different from this after the deliberate depreciation of the dollar; and there were frequent speculations in other countries as to thepossibility of open warfare between the British and American Exchange Equilisa-tion Funds. It was further evident that any such downward rivalry between thetwo principal world currencies must sooner or later make it impossible, as in factit did, for other countries to maintain a fixed parity with gold; and there was an obvious possibility that if these other countries were forced to abandon orthodoxy,they might, like the puritan who turns rake, throw over all restraint, and intensifythe competitive scramble. The Tripartite Agreement of 1936 marked the removalof these dangers.  It recorded a modus vivendi, vague, but none the less effective.The path to this modus vivendi was smoothed by the growth of disillusion-ment in the United Kingdom, and still more in the United States, about the powerof exchange depreciation to promote national recovery. The Americans foundthat the devaluation of the dollar opened no royal road to the restoration ofagricultural prices and prosperity; their attention turned to the problem of excessproduction, and to the internal experiments of the New Deal. British manufac-turers discovered that the. additional export trade that could be obtained by a lower pound was, in the prevailing world circumstances, limited and insecure.In short, the weapon of exchange depreciation proved in practice somewhatblunt, and this made it easier to secure a &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement &quot; not to use it.It should be noted that the bluntness of this particular weapon was duelargely to the fact that most of the world&apos;s trade was now subject to exchangeclearings, import restrictions, commodity regulation schemes, barter arrange-ments, international cartels, preferences and high tariffs. Only a small sectorremained in which there was an open field for price competition. To use acommon terminology, international trading conditions had been rendered&quot;rigid&quot; by the development of new types of trade restriction. Under theseconditions the competitive advantages of an under-valued currency, or the disadvantages of a slightly over-valued one, ceased to count for very much.Thus, the rigidity of the trading system, upon which such sweeping censureshave been passed, perhaps helped not a little to avert exchange depreciation war.(b) Managed Money.From the Tripartite Agreement of 1936 until the eve of war, exchange ratesremained comparatively steady. But there was no definite stabilisation, noreturn to the fixed parities which were a central feature of the old gold standard.Despite strong pressure that was brought to bear from time to time, the BritishGovernment persistently refused to restore any definite link between the poundand gold. We had adopted a policy of cheap money, believing that this would assist internal trade recovery.   If this policy were to have a fair chance, it
must be pursued uninterruptedly. It was doubtful, however, if this would bepossible in face of the ever present possibility of adverse capital movements,if we had a definite gold parity to defend.The British refusal to return to gold was thus largely attributable to thedesire to pursue an autonomous credit policy, to regulate our internal creditconditions in accordance with our view of the needs of trade. It is important to note that the idea of an autonomous, or, indeed, of a deliberate credit policy,was quite new. It was of the essence of the old gold standard system that money-rates, and the abundance or scarcity of credit, were determined by themovement of the exchange-rates and the inflow or outflow of gold. The system was praised as being essentially &quot; automatic &quot; and thus free from the dangerof political manipulation; and the function of management was supposed tobe limited to that of registering correctly the pressure of forces which no oneattempted to control. In the United States, in the 1920s, the superabundance ofgold reserves had made it possible to experiment with the deliberate regulationof internal monetary conditions; but these experiments were tentative, and anyambitious purpose of maintaining a steady price-level was emphaticallydisclaimed. No such freedom of action on a gold basis had seemed open to countries which had not large surplus stocks of gold.The pursuit by Great Britain of an autonomous credit policy entailedanother important consequence besides the absence of definite exchange parities.The volume of internal currency was divorced from the volume of the. goldreserve. Under the gold standard they had been linked rigidly together; anoutflow of gold caused a corresponding reduction of the currency available asa basis for bank credit, and this, if the outflow was substantial, led to creditrestriction and set in motion a deflationary process. This, it should be noted,was an essential link in the chain of automatic reactions by means of whichinternational equilibrium was maintained under the gold standard system.The internal deflation resulting from an outflow of gold did something to stimulate&apos; exports by reducing costs, and still more perhaps to curtail imports by reducing purchasing power. In these ways, it served to improve the balanceof payments.The link between internal currency and the gold reserve was broken, as anincident of the creation of the Exchange Equalisation Fund. This fact receivedless attention at the time than the instability of foreign exchange-rates, and the dangers of competitive exchange depreciation; and it is doubtful if its fullsignificance is yet appreciated. For it meant that the main regulator of the oldfreely-working international economy had been removed. International tradewas then so widely controlled that this did not seem to matter much. If, however,the attempt should be made to re-establish a freely-working system, it mightmatter a great deal more. For it is certain that the old regulator has been removed for good. The trend of ideas in internal policy, the insistence inparticular on the maintenance of &apos;&apos; full employment&apos;&apos; would make it impossiblefor any major country to leave the volume of its internal purchasing-power to bedetermined in future by blind external forces. In this respect there can be noreturn to the automatism of the gold standard system.%(c) Exchange Clearings and Dr. Schacht.While the exchange-rates of the free-exchange countries were undergoingthe vicissitudes that have been described, developments of great significance hadbeen taking place in Central and Eastern Europe. Germany, in the crisis of 1931,had introduced an increasingly effective system of exchange control as the only alternative to a renewal of depreciation. This did not suffice, however, to solveher problem, which was aggravated when the pound sterling fell and Britainadopted, a general tariff. Still shrinking from exchange depreciation in the belief that German opinion would regard this as a signal for inflation, the BriiningGovernment set themselves to restore equilibrium by deflating costs and prices,and persisted in this course until the strains it caused swept away the Republicanregime and brought Hitler into power. It has already been seen that a similardeflationary policy was to prove largely instrumental three years later in bringingM. Blum into office in France. There was no surer prescription for the defeat of governments during the inter-war period than persistence in deflation.Hitler was no less determined than his predecessors to avoid an opendepreciation of the mark. But his general policy was hardly reconcilable with a continuance of deflation; and the over-valuation of the mark was materiallyincreased in 1933 when the dollar was artificially forced down.   A means of
escape&apos; from this impasse was provided by the expedients of Dr. Schacht, whobecame President of the Reichsbank under Hitler. The mark was kept nominallyat its parity Vvith gold; but materially lower exchange-rates were in effectjDermitted for approved trading transactions. Complex arrangements were madeunder which there were various classes of mark accounts with different degrees of convertibility and different effective exchange-values. The attention of the outside world was caught by the anomalies incidental to these expedients; but their chief importance in the story is that they helped to give a peculiar form tothe exchange clearing agreements which Dr. Schacht proceeded to negotiate withother countries.Germany, it is important to note, did not initiate the exchange clearingsystem. The first exchange clearing agreement was made between Switzerland,and Hungary as early as November 1931; and this was followed by a series of similar agreements between European countries. Their purpose was to facilitate the continuance of mutually advantageous trade despite the impediments resultingfrom the collapse of the gold standard and from national systems of exchange control. Though the form may vary, and though the technical details are oftencomplex, the essential principles of an exchange clearing agreement can be statedsimply as follows : The individuals who are parties to a trading transactionbetween the two countries concerned receive payment from, or make payment to, their own Central Bank, in their own currency. The two Central Banks&quot; clear &quot; these and other transactions, i.e., set inward payments off againstoutward payments, at an agreed, rate of exchange; and any resulting balance is represented by a credit accruing to the one Central Bank in the books and inthe currency of the other.This arrangement carries the automatic consequence that the country with afavourable balance lends the difference to the country with an&apos; unfavourablebalance; and, if the latter country maintains a strict system of exchange-control,this loan can only be liquidated by the purchase of its goods or services. Thusunder the conditions which prevailed in the 1930s, exchange clearing agreements were apt to lead on to &quot; barter &apos;&apos; trade agreements, designed to keep the clearingsin reasonable equilibrium. This meant in effect an attempt to adjust the trade between countries on highly bilateral lines, and a sacrifice of the advantages of&quot;triangular &quot; or multilateral trade. On the other hand, it did much to enablecountries which had got into trouble through a heavily adverse balance of pay-ments to restore equilibrium without curtailing their imports unduly.These are consequences which must ordinarily be expected to result from an exchange-clearing system, adopted in conditions of disorganised internationalpayments and world depression. But Germany gave a peculiar turn to thissystem by incorporating&quot; in her agreements the expedient of the over-valued mark,qualified where necessary by differential exchange-rates. In her clearing agree-ments with the Balkan countries, Germany insisted that the mark must be reckoned at its nominal gold parity. In return for this, she was willing to makelong-term contracts for the purchase of the Balkan cereals, pigs and tobacco, at prices that were materially higher, in terms of the Balkan currencies, than themarket prices ruling. One effect of this arrangement was to keep prices up inGermany and the Balkans alike. In the Balkan countries, for example, theagricultural producers obtained higher prices for their exports that they could otherwise have done, while manufactured goods or machinery, which had to beobtained from Germany, were correspondingly dear. Under the prevailing con-ditions of depressed prices, and especially of depressed agricultural prices, thisfeature had decided attractions as a safeguard against internal unrest.Another consequence, or another aspect of the same consequence was, how-ever, more equivocal. The high prices which the Balkan agricultural producersobtained in the German market cut them off from other markets. To Germanmanufacturers, exports to the Balkans became similarly an especially remunerativebranch of trade. The German share of the import and export trade of the sixBalkan countries (including Turkey) rose from roughly one-fifth in 1933 toroughly one-half in 1938. Thus the Balkans fell into a condition of substantialeconomic dependence upon Germany which assisted Hitler&apos;s political and strategic aims.From a strictly economic standpoint there is no reason to suppose thatGermany derived any advantage from her insistence on the over-valued mark orfrom Ihe large geographical diversion of trade which it caused. The difficultiesof her traders in competing in free-exchange markets were increased thereby;and; she &apos; found it necessary to adopt various roundabout and only partially effective expedients for subsidising exports in order to obtain the
foreign exchange which she required. But from the standpoint of preparation for war it was of great advantage to Germany to reduce her dependence onsources of supply which would be cut off during war and to extend and deepenchannels of trade which she could protect and command. Under cover ofapparently makeshift and ramshackle commercial expedients, she was forging a weapon to counter the blockade. To the rulers of Germany this consideration was paramount.Germany negotiated clearing agreements with many other countries, besidesthose of South-Eastern Europe. In 1932, it is worth noting, France, holland and Switzerland entered into clearing agreements with her, hoping to ensurethat the proceeds of Germany&apos;s export surplus to them would be earmarked for the payment of debt charges to their nationals. This hope was quicklydisappointed; the German authorities saw to it that their export surplus wasreplaced by an import surplus, and thereby converted the clearings into a meansof borrowing more. In 1935 Dr. Schacht proceeded to negotiate a series of agreements with the South American Republics which, like those with the balkan countries, were intended to develop trade. Here, however, he was unable to get his point accepted that the mark should be reckoned at its nominalgold parity. The South American agreements were based on special ad hocrates of exchange which represented varying rates of discount for the mark.The particular rate embodied in a particular treaty was determined mainly by economic bargaining strength. Dr. Schacht was prepared to concede a com-paratively low rate for the mark to countries whose products Germany urgentlydesired to buy. He stuck out for a comparatively high one in his negotiationswith countries which had no alternative outlet for their products.Thus Germany used the technique of differential exchange-rates as a means-of securing favourable &quot; terms of trade.&quot;&apos; She took the different South american countries one by one, and tried, like a &quot; discriminating monopoly,&quot; to chargein each case what the traffic would bear. This was something quite new in international commerce; it seemed unfair; and the indignation of other countries was the more readily aroused because third parties were liable to suffer in their export trade from the &quot; barter &quot; element in the clearing agreements. Graduallyit bcame evident that the German foreign trade policy, taken as a whole, wasproving markedly successful from the German point of view. It was natural, inthese circumstances, to attribute the success to the peculiar Schachtian expedients,and to conclude hastily that Germany had succeeded by a ruthless exploitation of her bargaining strength in obtaining exceptionally favourable terms of trade at the expense of poor agricultural exporting countries.This belief is still widely prevalent; but it is a complete illusion. Germany&apos;terms of trade were not favourable but less favourable than those of free-exchange industrial countries. The relation between the prices of primary products and the prices of manufactured goods, which prevailed throughout mostof the 1930s, was, of course, extremely unfavourable to countries which specialisedin the former. But Germany seems, on the whole, to have given as good terms as any other country to her agricultural suppliers. In her dealings with the balkan States, it is doubtful if Germany attempted to exploit her bargaining position to the full. Her governing object there, as has been seen, was todevelop channels of trade on which she could rely during war, as well as tobuild up a position of political domination; and for these purposes it was desirable that the trading arrangements should be manifestly to the economic advantage of the Balkan peoples. In her dealings with tihe South Amercian States,Germany was restrained by no similar scruple and undoubtedly tried for themost favourable terms she could get. But in this she does not seem to have achieved any conspicuous success.This is not to sajr that the exchange clearing system was not economicallyadvantageous to Germany. This system enabled her. despite her externalindebtedness and her lack of monetary reserves, to maintain and to increase thevolume of her trade. It enabled her, in other words, not to buy cheap and to selldear, but to buy more and to sell more. It is a mistake to suppose that her Nazirulers set out to reduce Germany&apos;s external trade to a minimum. They aimed&apos; doubtless at self-sufficiency for commodities which could be produced in sufficient quantities at home. But this was in order to make possible increased imports ofother commodities, notably war materials. Actually, Germ any&apos;s foreign tradeincreased by about 20 per cent, between the low point of 1932 and 1938; and though during this period there was a substantial recovery of world trade, theGerman share of world trade increased slightly.  The significance of this increase
is heightened by the fact that it was accompanied by a huge increase, largely-represented by armaments, in German production for the home market, whichwould tend under unregulated conditions to reduce a country&apos;s capacity to sellabroad.The moral which this part of the German story suggests is that a sufficientvolume of trade is much more important than favourable terms of trade to a country in a weak international financial position but possessing a largeindustrial capacity. Production for export is only a comparatively small partof the total production of an industrial country. Even in Great Britain thepre-war proportion was only 15 per cent. From the standpoint of production,therefore, an adverse movement of the terms of trade by as much as 10 per cent,would mean only that we should have to increase our total production by1 - 5 per cent, in order to purchase an undiminished quantity of imports. Thisis an increase which the ordinary process of technical improvement gives us in asingle year. It represents only a small part of the productive power whichindustrial countries normally waste in unemployment. Such countries have therefore no good reason to adopt a grudging attitude upon the terms of their trade with agricultural countries, if they can be assured of selling enough todefray their imports. To be able to sell enough may, on the other hand, be of vital consequence.The advantage of selling more as a means of buying more, which Germanyderived from the clearing agreements, did not depend on the special Schachtianexpedients; it sprang from the essential principles of the exchange clearingsystem as defined above. It was not an advantage which accrued to Germanyalone; it was automatically extended to the agricultural countries in the balkans and in South America, with whom the clearing agreements were made. To the balkan countries in particular the economic gain was great. Their agriculturaltechnique was backward, and their marketing organisation rudimentary. their products were therefore of poor or uncertain quality, not easy to sell in world markets under conditions of excess supply. Yet, lacking for the most partindustries of their own. they urgently needed to export in order to obtain thewherewithal to buy manufactured consumers goods. Their clearing agreements with Germany met this need, and rescued them from the apparently irremediableconfusion in which they had been plunged by the world depression. Germany&apos;sattempt to acquire political preponderance in the Balkans was helped by the factthat her economic relations with them were relations of reciprocal advantagerather than of exploitation.This at least was broadly true until 1938. As the war drew near Germanyturned to her advantage another feature of the exchange clearing system, namely,that the country with a favourable balance of payments automatically lends thedifference to the country with an adverse balance. With her industrial capacityincreasingly concentrated on armament production, Germany cut down her exports to the Balkan countries, and the latter were obliged accordingly to sellpart of their produce not for goods but for credits. During the present war,with Germany in a position to dictate her terms, this process has, of course, beencarried much further; and Germany&apos;s satellites have been forced to supply an increasingly large portion of their output in return for mark balances which maybe worth little when the war is over. Apart from the question of their eventualvalue, these accumulating mark balances are, of course, fundamentally similar tothe accumulating sterling balances by which Great Britain has financed a large part of her war-time purchases. The British system of payments agreements,and indeed the arrangements of the sterling area provide automatic borrowingfacilities which closely resemble those of the exchange-clearing system.The moral of this part of the story is that these automatic borrowingfacilities are a help and a protection to countries in a &quot; debit &quot; position, i.e., withan adverse balance of payments which the)&apos;&apos; cannot speedily adjust. the borrowing country does not have to approach the lending country with a request for accommodation; the onus is upon the lending country to refuse the accommodation, if it chooses, by curtailing its exports. This transfer of theinitiative is a gx^eat advantage to a country which needs to borrow. Theadvantage oan be put to good ends or to bad. Germany used it to increase herpower for aggression. We have since used it to increase our power to resist -aggression. The advantage is subject to the limits set by the complaisance of the lender; and it should be noted that the credits which Germany obtained throughthe mechanism of her exchange clearings amounted to only a small fraction of the loans which she raised during the 1920s and subsequently repudiated. It is not clear, therefore, that the automatic borrowing facilities of exchange clearing are
more open to abuse than the traditional forms of international lending, organisedwith the aid of an hypnosis of wishful thinking. Nor is it clear that the formerfacilities, related as they are to the actual flow of trade, might not provide in less warlike times a more efficient lubricant for a balanced system of internationalcommerce.The chief significance of the main story of the exchange clearing agreementsis that they served to increase rather than to decrease the aggregate volume of world trade. They enabled both Germany and her agricultural customers to buymore and to sell more than they could have done otherwise. Nor were thesemutual economic benefits obtained at the expense of any commensurate injury tothe trade of other countries which were financially strong enough to maintain a free exchange system. These countries had no desire to increase their importsof either Balkan and South American agricultural products or of Germanmanufactures. Yet, unless they did so, neither Germany nor the Balkan andSouth American countries could afford to buy more from them.(d) Selective Import Control.Germany combined her exchange clearing agreements with an elaboratesystem of selective import control. By means of the former, she maintained and increased her external purchasing-power; by means of the latter she put thispurchasing-power to the most effective use. The governing object of her policy was to develop her strength for war; and this she did with a rapidity and a com-pleteness which confounded all the calculations based on previous experience withwhich the democracies lulled their misgivings for several years. Starting from aposition of decisive military inferiority in 1933, Germany had attained by 1938the overmastering ascendancy which enabled Hitler to dictate the terms ofMunich. Never in history had the balance of power been so suddenly reversed.Never had so little resistance been offered to the rearmament of a State whosedangerous designs were only perfunctorily concealed. Behind this lack of resist-ance lay&quot; many factors, among them the perverse purblindness imposed on the democracies by their favourite formulas. But also among them, it is clear, wasthe quite unexpected rapidity with which the rearmament was accomplished.The development of German strength for war rested on the solid basis of thelarge productive capacity of German industry, together with its high technicalskill. This, however, would not have been sufficient in itself. Germany needed to import materials to a large aggregate value, both for her ordinary industries andfor her armament production. She wanted also to lay in large stocks of these materials as a war reserve; arid, in fact, it was with large stocks of petroleum,bauxite, manganese,- &amp;c, that she entered the present war. To finance these purchases it was important for her to increase her external purchasing-power asmuch as possible. As has been seen, she did this to a fairly substantial extent bymeans of her clearing agreements. None the less, these agreements left germany with a much smaller external purchasing-power than she had enjoyed in the later1920s. Moreover, many of the more important of the materials she needed couldonly be obtained from free-exchange markets, in which the self-imposed handicapof the over-valued mark, and in some degree the Jewish boycott, made it difficult for her to sell.Default on her external loans and the later seizure of the monetary reserves of Austria and Czecho-Slovakia helped her somewhat. But selective import control was the instrument upon which Germany mainly relied. She cut downruthlessly her imports of commodities which her people could do without or could produce for themselves, and by this means she made more foreign exchange avail -able for the materials she wanted for her war preparations. For imports essentialto the standard of life she continued, however, to find sufficient foreign exchange.Indeed, the proportion of food in her total imports increased between 1933 and1938, though this increase doubtless represented the accumulation of war reserves.It was widely believed at the time that Germany was developing her strength forwar at the expense of her standards of living. That was true in the sense thather people worked harder and for longer hours without very much additional realreward. But, when all factors are taken into account, it seems a mistake to suppose that the standard of living fell; certainly it did not fall materially.In other words, the German policy of intensive rearmament and the accumulation of war supplies raised two distinct problems, a production problem and an import problem. The production problem was solved easily enough bythe absorption of the unemployed, the taking up of industrial slack, the increasedemployment of women and longer hours of work.     The import problem was
solved partly by means of clearing agreements, which enabled Germany to export and import more than she could otherwise have clone; but mainly by a systematic selection of imports, on the basis of an efficient system of exchange control. There was nothing magical about the results which Germany achieved.During the war we have used largely the -same methods, and have obtainedessentially the same results. None the less, these results were in sharp contrast to the tribulations which Germany had endured in the 1920s. They contrastedno less sharply with the contemporary experience of Trance, where the powerand even the will to strengthen the national defences was paralysed by economicconfusion.In these contrasts, it is true, the fundamental factor was the existence orthe absence of effective control over capital movements; and the first lesson thatemerges is the importance of this control to almost any country which wishes to assure itself against dislocating disturbances in its economic life. But theGerman achievement also indicates how great is the relief which a country thatis short of international purchasing-power can obtain from a deliberate andsystematic selection of its imports.The items that make up a country&apos;s import-bill, when imports areunregulated and subject only to the impediment of old-established protectivetariffs, are extremely miscellaneous. They include necessaries and luxuries;commodities of which the people consume too little, and commodities of whichthey consume more than enough, for a satisfactory standard of life; commoditiesthat might have been, and commodities that could not have been, produced at-home. There is also what is sometimes called the &apos;&apos; invisible &apos;&apos; import ofexpenditure on foreign tours or travel, which makes a call on the foreign exchange resources of the tourist&apos;s country. Great Britain, for example, in times ofpeace spends her foreign exchange upon a wide range of purposes, which includeswheat, meat, fruit and tobacco; cotton, wool, iron-ore and newsprint; motor-cars, wine, foreign films and holidays at Monte Carlo. Under regulated con-ditions, the amount of foreign exchange which a country spends upon each ofthese diverse purposes is determined as the aggregate result of the decisions ofits individual citizens and business men, in accordance with.the length of thepurse which each happens to command.That is well enough for a country that has plenty of foreign exchange.But it is not a satisfactory arrangement, or lack of arrangements, for a country that is suffering from an acute shortage of external purchasing-power. This,as has been seen, was the condition of many countries during the inter-war period, as it may be the condition of many after the present war. A countryin this condition must strive to limit its annual expenditure by reference to its international income. If it neglects to do this it will incur a steadily increasinginternational indebtedness, with a serious exchange crisis as the probable sequel.But if it must curtail its imports below the level that would result from anunregulated demand, it seems only right and reasonable that it should endeavourto cut down first the &quot; fat&quot; which is contained in every country&apos;s peace-timeimport programme, and to maintain its essential imports as long as it can inuncliminished volume.This was the purpose of many of the import prohibitions and import restric-tions that were introduced so widely during the 1930s. The world economicdepression, and the collapse of agricultural prices which accompanied it, leftmany countries, notably those of Eastern Europe and South America, with anexternal income which was insufficient to meet their accustomed import bill. Itwas no longer possible for them to meet the deficiency by borrowing, and areduction of imports was forced upon them accordingly as an inexorable necessity.They were faced with the problem of laying out a shrunken international income to the best advantage, a problem essentially similar to the problem of domesticeconomy which arises from time to time in many private households. For solvingthis problem, for cutting the national import-bill substantially with the minimum of hardship, the method of quantitative restrictions and prohibitions hadmanifest advantages over that of tariffs. Thus countries in exchange difficulties had recourse increasingly to the quantitative method. Germany, as has been seen, used it with scientific thoroughness, as a means of developing her strengthfor war. Long before this, Soviet Russia had selected her imports equallysystematically by means of her State monopoly of foreign trade. But most ofthe countries which selected their imports by quantitative regulation during the1930s did so without any predisposition in favour of this method, acting ratherunder the urgent pressure of events.
All types of import restrictions were naturally unpalatable to exporters-elsewhere, who found their goods excluded. The United Kingdom and theUnited States were prominent among the exporting countries, which suffered orappeared to suffer from these restrictions;, and it is not surprising, therefore,that the first reaction of public opinion in the English-speaking world shouldhave been to condemn import restrictions generally as a new type of tradeimpediment, more objectionable than tariffs. But it is doubtful whether thevolume of international trade was diminished by import restrictions that were imposed to meet exchange difficulties. The countries that were suffering from ashortage of foreign exchange income had no desire to cut down their total importsmore than was necessary for equilibrium; and by and large they did not do so.They imported one thing rather than another, necessaries rather than luxuries;,but they imported in the aggregate as much as they could afford to buy.Undoubtedly the curtailment of their imports was a pis alter. It wouldhave been more satisfactory to them to increase their exports, and thus to obtainthe wherewithal to import more. This they tried to do by exchange clearingagreements, by barter arrangements, by every means open to them. The fact-remained that their international income had been reduced. The corollaryremained that they must reduce their external expenditure. The practicalinference remained that they could reduce their external expenditure with theleast injury to their standard of living by selecting their imports deliberately by;quantitative means.(e) The Varieties of Quantitative Regulation.Import restrictions were introduced during the 1930s for other purposesbesides the one that has been indicated; and there were other types of quantitative regulation besides import restrictions. Indeed, the evolution of&apos;quantitative arrangements of various types and for diverse purposes was a significant feature of the decade. Several of them have already been mentionedin the course of this narrative.The principal forms of quantitative regulation were as follows : (1) Selective Import Control; that is to say, import restrictions orprohibitions designed to lay out a limited external purchasing-power-to the best advantage.(2) Protective Import Restrictions; i.e., restrictions designed to protect,particular producing interests in the countries imposing them. many countries used import restrictions during the 1930s to protectagriculture.(3) Preferential Import Restrictions. Quota restrictions were imposed inmany British colonies on imports of textiles and certain other goods from foreign countries. These restrictions were so framed that theyapplied in practice only to imports from Japan, which had previously been increasing with quite exceptional rapidity. Their object, ofcourse, was to safeguard the share of the Lancashire cotton trade andother British exporting industries in colonial markets. quota restrictions were also imposed by the United Kingdom on imports of meat and bacon, partly with the object of giving an effective preference to producers in the Dominions.(4) Barter Trade Arrangements; that is to say, the provisions in many trade agreements by which one country undertook to import not less than somuch of certain products from another. As has already been seen,such barter arrangements were a common supplement to exchangeclearing agreements. Similar arrangements were a feature of thetrade agreements which the United Kingdom made with various countries, e.g., Denmark and Argentina. Their object was to safe-guard or to extend the mutual trade of the parties concerned.(5) Commodity Regulation Schemes; that is to say, schemes for regulating the production or export of certain primary commodities by agree-ment between the chief producing countries. The object of these schemes was to keep the prices of the regulated commodities from falling to unremunerative levels as the result of excess supply. Themethod employed was that each producing country agreed to restrict;its exports and often its production within the limits of an assigned&quot;quota.&quot;   These schemes were usually organised by governments,:
and were backed by local legislation. The principal commodities that were so regulated were rubber, tin, sugar and tea; and the british colonial empire was a major participant and beneficiary in ail of them.(6) International Cartels; by which the business interests of different countries allocated export markets in certain lines of trade by mutual agreement.(7) State Trading; by which the purchase of certain imports (or the saleof certain exports) was centralised in a single, agency. The quantityof the goods imported was made the subject of deliberate decision as anincidental feature of this system which could, of course, be used as a means of selective import control, of domestic protection, or for anyother purpose. This system has been carried to its furthest lengths by soviet Russia.The variety of purpose and of character which these arrangements cover willbe apparent. Some were designed to defend currencies, some to protect industries,some to promote self-sufficiency, some to develop foreign trade, some to maintainprices. Again, some were set in a national, some in an Imperial, some in a bilateral, and some in an international frame. Yet all of them embodied thecommon principle of deliberate quantitative regulation which before 1914 was virtually unknown. It is stupid to sweep away all this variegated developmentwith schoolmasterly disapproval as something which should not have occurred andmust not occur again.The unity of principle underlying so much diversity is the more impressivein that the development proceeded for a considerable time without any consciousrecognition of the principle, and certainly without any predisposition in itsfavour. Import restrictions, for example, in their early days had no friends.They were condemned equally by the exponents of traditional economic doctrineand by those of fashionable nostrums. They were repugnant to individualists, tocollectivists, and to business men; and the Governments that imposed them did so at first reluctantly. Most of the quantitative expedients that have beenenumerated were introduced, not as applications of a new constructive idea, but asad hoc remedies for pressing evils; and they were chosen because no other remediesseemed likely to be equally efficacious.The drift towards quantitative methods came from the increasing failure ofthe price mechanism to discharge the functions that had been entrusted to it.Hitherto it had been thought unnecessary for economic policy to concern itself with quantities, or volumes, or gross concrete facts. It was assumed that anyreadjustment that might be needed could be brought about by a change in someprice or rate. Was some commodity in excess supply? A fall of price would reduce production, stimulate demand, and the excess would disappear. Had somecountry an adverse balance of payments ? A lowering of its costs and income-level,or alternatively a lowering of its exchange-rates, would put the matter right.Was capital flying abroad? Higher interest-rates would bring it back. were there too many workpeople seeking employment in a depressed industry? reduce their wages and they would move elsewhere. Did a country wish to protect itspeasant agriculture from foreign competition? It was easy to calculate thenecessary scale of import duties or of subsidies. Economic theory wras almost exclusively devoted to analysing the working and the inter-connections of thedifferent parts of the price system. To a very large extent, moreover, this outlookwas common to the advocates and to the opponents of laisser-faire. Theirdifference was that the former maintained that the price system would work bestif left to itself, while the latter held that active intervention was often needed toget the rates or prices right.In the conditions that prevailed after the world economic crisis, the pricesystem failed to justify the faith reposed in it. Producers of primary commoditiesfound that prices might fall to disastrous levels, and still supply might greatlyexceed demand. Importing countries that wished to ensure a reasonable livelihoodto their farmers were unable to judge what rates of import duty would besufficient for the purpose. Countries in serious exchange difficulties found higherdiscount-rates futile as a check to a flight of capital, and deflation disastrous as a means of adjusting current payments. In one sphere after another it became evident that there were disequilibria too large and too deep-seated to be adjustedindirectly by the manipulation of a price or rate. There was no alternative but tograpple with them directly, that is to say, by concrete quantitative means,In most of its applications, of course, the technique of quantitative regulation raised problems and difficulties of its own.    In applying import
restrictions, for example, how should the permitted volume of imports be sharedbetween different exporting countries or between different importing firms ?The former question might be affected by a bilateral trade agreement orpreferential arrangement, but, subject to this, the usual answer to both questionswas to assign &quot;quotas&quot; on the basis of past performance, that is to say, by reference to the exports or imports in a particular year or longer period,selected as a base. The same principle was used in allocating export quotasunder commodity regulation schemes. It was the obvious principle to adopt;it met the desire for fair-play in an intelligible manner; and so long as the quantitative arrangements could be viewed as emergency measures, it seemedreasonable enough. It is clear, however, that it would be seriously defective asthe basis of any continuing arrangement; and though provisions were madeunder some quantitative schemes for revising the original allocations from timeto time, it cannot be said that any satisfactory means of doing this had been evolved.When the problem of allocation Lad been settled, another difficulty arose.If the permitted volume of imports of some commodity was materially less thanthe competitive demand, the natural consequence would be to raise the price in the importing country but to reduce it in the exporting countries. Therewas thus a potential gap between the import price and the export price, withthe possibility of large profits to traders on one side of the frontier or theether. From this it followed that import licences might have a substantialcash value and thus offer new temptations to corruption. For reasons such as these quantitative restrictions have been described in the booklet on QuantitativeTrade Controls, published by the League of Nations in 1943, as a &apos;&apos; non-conform-able &quot; type of interference with the individualist economy.*This, however, is to use the phrase &quot;individualist economy&quot; in a strict,,or rather an extreme, sense in which it no longer corresponds to the facts of alarge part of the economic system. It assumes that international trade in any commodity is the result of a multiplicity of small individual transactions betweencompeting private traders in the importing and exporting countries. In modern-times, however, countries that produce agricultural commodities for export have tended increasingly to organise their marketing through some central selling-agency. This has enabled them to grade their products scientifically, and byensuring that their exports are of reliable quality to win &quot; goodwill &quot; for themin export markets. There is no doubt, indeed, that this development marks animprovement in technical efficiency. The Danish bacon trade owed much of its-successful expansion to the fact that it had long been organised upon this basis.Where central selling arrangements exist, the potential gap between import and export prices under quantitative regulation need not be either an objectionor a difficulty. It is possible for the importing country, if it is so disposed, toallow the selling organisation of the exporting country to obtain the whole benefitof the higher price in the import market resulting from the reduced volume of sales. In this way producers in the exporting country will receive compensation in the form of higher prices for the reduction in their volume of business:It was in this spirit that the United Kingdom Government administered therestriction of bacon imports, which they imposed in 1933. They had decided tobuild up a bacon industry at home; and at first indeed contemplated carryingtheir policy to extreme lengths. But they wished to do this with the minimuminjury to Denmark and other exporting countries. The price of bacon, like-those of most agricultural commodities, had fallen very low; and there was a widespread and somewhat crude disposition to regard the fall of commodity prices as the fons et origo of the evil of the world depression, and to welcomeaccordingly any recovery of these prices, anywhere, however brought about.British Ministers were also influenced by the consideration that the Danes would&quot;be able to buy more British goods if they got better prices for their products.In these circumstances they quite genuinely thought it a merit of the quantitative-&quot;* The following is the passage in which this phrase appears: &quot;Quantitative restrictions-constitute a much more serious interference with the individualist economy based on the pricemechanism and free enterprise than the other type of regulation. &quot;We may characterise them as.,a &apos; non-conformable &apos; type of interference, a foreign substance, as it were, in the body of the freeeconomy which necessarily leads to dangerous ulcerations and suppurations and threatens to weaken or undermine the individualist economy altogether. On the other hand, Customs tariffs,,even high ones, are &apos; conformable &apos; interferences which do not destroy the price mechanism onthe functioning of which a private economy must depend.&quot; It seems hardly appropriate, however,&apos;.,to describe central marketing organisations for agricultural commodities as &quot; ulcerations and&apos;suppurations.&quot;
method of protection that it would enable the Danes, through their central organisation, to get the benefit of a higher price and the further benefit of planning their future production on the basis of knowledge rather thanguesswork. Other exporting countries shared in these benefits, and the fact thatthe system stimulated them to develop similar central marketing agencies was certainly no disadvantage to them.It is obvious that the interests of Denmark and other bacon exporters wouldhave been far more seriously injured if the United Kingdom had tried to establish a bacon industry at home by protective tariffs. The duties would have reduced the prices received by the Danish farmers; and, if they were to fulfil the objectof making room for home production, they would have had to be put high enoughto reduce the volume of Danish exports. Thus the producers of bacon would have suffered a double loss, whereas under the plan adopted the total payment they received was actually increased. In short, the use of the quantitative methodenabled the British Government to show far more consideration for the establishedtrade interests of the supplying countries than would have been possible if theyhad used tariffs instead; and it seems only fair to remember this fact whenquantitative restrictions are contrasted with tariffs as a more objectionable formof &quot;economic nationalism.&quot;*From the British point of view the quantitative method had the advantage that it was a more accurate means than tariffs of achieving a moderate protectiveend; that is to say, ensuring a limited volume of home production, without raisingprices unduly to the consuming public. The bacon scheme, as it happened, was notparticularly successful, and the result makes it doubtful whether it is wise to aim at developing pig production in England as a major livestock industry. But onthe question of method the experiment showed that for agricultural products atany rate quantitative regulation may be more &apos;&apos; conformable &quot; than tariffs with modern marketing arrangements. It should be noted in this connection that allthe statutory marketing schemes introduced during the 1930s as a principalfeature of British agricultural policy were accompanied by the quantitativelimitation of imports, as an obviously appropriate counterpart.Of the international regulation schemes, several worked in practice betterthan might have been supposed. The a priori predisposition was to regard these schemes as illegitimate conspiracies of producing interests to exploit the consumers. The Stevenson rubber scheme of the 1920s, which attempted to main-tain the price of rubber at a highly profitable level, had indeed been fairly opento this charge; but the speedy collapse of that experiment taught the lesson thatit was impossible to obtain and to enforce an agreement to limit production-, ona sufficiently comprehensive basis, if the price offered a strong temptation toincrease output. The regulation schemes of the 1930s were accordingly markedby moderation of aim. Persistent efforts were made to induce Governments that were chiefly interested as consumers to participate; and the objective of stimula-ting and diversifying demand, was pursued as well as that of limiting supply.Production was not restricted by more than was clearly essential in order toraise prices gradually to a modest target price; no complaint could reasonably bemade of the prices that were in fact reached under any of the schemes foragricultural commodities.It may be added that the subsequent wartime experience of these schemeswent to show that there was substance in the claim that regulation might prove-as helpful when it was desired, to increase production as when it was desired to restrict it. The huge increase in the American demand for rubber which occurred in 1941, and which the lack of prescience incidental to a free market had deferred* Yet paradoxically enough the fact is treated by some critics as an additional offence. , Th&amp;League of Nations booklet on Quantitative Trade Controls gives the following version of the story : &quot;In many cases quotas were allocated not only to home importers but to foreign exporters,or only to the latter. Foreign interests were thus given a part of the spoils and induced to1acquiesce in the situation, creating further vested interests and removing possible opposition. Thewhole benefit, indeed, sometimes went to the exporter .... Similar results ensued from theimposition of the quota restriction on Danish bacon imports into the United Kingdom in 1933.The Danish exporters, who were organised, were &quot;able to raise bacon prices so that they were-more than compensated for the cut in the quantity of their exports.&quot; This passage is significantas indicating how deeply intelleotualist criticism of quantitative methods is irJftuejftcff^Jffi ^nostalgiafor the price sjreteqa rather than by genuine concern for the well-being of any of the human&quot;&apos;beingsaffected. Arrangements designed to mitigate injury to exporting countries are described as though they were a sinister sort of bribery.. The use of the word &quot; spoils &quot; implies a tacit assumptionthat the &quot;:pricei which would result &quot;from unregulated supply and demand, even under severe&quot;depression, represents the jiisium prethwi... - .     ... ...       .. &apos;
unwisely until then, would hardly have been met with such a moderate rise of price, if production had been unregulated, and the estates had been left to scramblewith one another for labour without restraint. It is doubtful, moreover, whetherso large a productive capacity would have been available in Malaya and theDutch East Indies with which to meet this demand if nothing had been done tomaintain the price of rubber after 1932.The instance of rubber serves to illustrate one of the fundamental reasons why the automatic adjustments of the price system fail to work satisfactorilynowadays for most agricultural products. The period of agricultural produc-tion is often very long. It takes from five to seven years after planting for rubber-trees to become productive. It is possible, therefore, under unregulatedconditions, for excessive planting to persist for several years under the stimulusOf a comparatively high price, and for the productive capacity to continue to expand after the price has fallen heavily. This characteristic is shared by otherplantation industries, such as tea and coconuts; and in a lesser degree or in amore complex form (e.g., through systems of crop rotation) it holds good of a wide range of agricultural production. Other factors contribute to the same result, e.g., a large proportion of the world&apos;s agriculture is in the hands ofpeasants or small farmers who respond to a fall in their receipts by increasing their exertions. It was only because of the continuing need for additionalproductive capacity that serious trouble did not arise from these causes before1914. But now that agricultural technique has caught up with the expansionof world demand, the need to regulate production deliberately, if disastrousfluctuations are to be avoided, presents itself with a practical force that cannot be ignored.International regulation schemes were one of the attempts of the 1930s tomeet this need; and it seems probable in the light of this experience that for alimited range of commodities such schemes may have a useful role to play infuture.The attempts of industrial cartels to allocate markets among competingcountries * were open to more serious objections and were less clearly justified,though it would be rash to infer that they can never be justified. More generally,I the experience of the 1930s suggests that quantitative methods of regulationf are less satisfactory for industrial than for agricultural products. But this doesnot mean that import restrictions upon manufactured or semi-manufacturedgoods niay not be a sensible expedient for a country with a heavy adverse balanceof payments. In such circumstances, the theoretical difficulty of the gap betweenthe import price and the export price may be overcome either (when the goods are luxuries) by coupling the quantitative restrictions: with substantial importduties, or (when the goods are more essential) by combining them with measuresof price-control. Again, as has been seen, trade agreements of a barter charactermay be useful in enabling countries that are short of international purchasingpower to maintain a larger external trade than would otherwise be practicable.The war-time development of central purchasing is closely related to thequestion Of quantitative methods. During the war the greater part of Britain&apos;imports are bought centrally through the agency of the Ministry of Food and theMinistry of Supply. For several commodities these departments enter into bulkcontracts for the purchase of the output of certain countries, and these arrange-ments have advantages from the standpoints of both the importer and the producer. How much of this system of central purchase will be retained whenthe war is over is, of course, uncertain. Similar arrangements were evolvedduring the last war for a number of foodstuffs and materials, and were sweptaway quickly afterwards. Upon this occasion, however, there will be manyarguments for retaining part of the war-time mechanism for at least a consider-able period. It is possible that in other countries systems of central purchasemay be retained or introduced in order to deal with pressing post-war. difficulties.As already indicated, such arrangements may be regarded as a special, and indeedextreme, variety of quantitative regulation.The broad impression that emerges from a review of the quantitative experi-ments. of the 1930s is that they served on the whole to help rather than to hinderinternational economic recovery. They brought much-needed relief to hard-pressed sections of producers and to hard-pressed countries. They provided an area of firm ground amid the quagmire of disordered price-levels and exchange-rates. They facilitated constructive efforts to improve marketing arrangements and made it easier for all concerned to plan ahead. They showed themselves a useful, if not an indispensable auxiliary of internal policies designed to meet the
widespread desire for greater economic security, including, in particular, steadieremployment.^ .This record compares favourably with that of most of the other devices bywhich the economic statesmanship of the 1930s tried to grope its way out of depression. Especially striking is the contrast with the results of exchange depreciation which, as has been seen, were disappointing to the countries thatattempted it, yet caused disastrous disturbance to the economies of other countries.By the test of results, as distinct from a priori preconceptions, the quantitativetechnique must be judged far more consonant with international comity.It has, of course, been subjected to much international criticism on the groundthat it provides a way round the obligations of the most-favoured-nation clause,and may entail &quot; discrimination.&quot; But before the justice of this criticism canbe appraised, it is necessary to consider another remarkable development of the1930s, namely, the challenge to the most-favoured nation clause itself which came from the countries with the most consistently liberal traditions of commercial policy.(f) Preferential Systems and Low-Tariff Clubs.Under the most-favoured-nation clause a country is bound to give equallyfavourable tariff treatment to all countries with which it has treaties containingthis clause, whether their tariffs are high or low, increasing or diminishing,&quot; negotiable &quot; or &quot; non-negotiable.&quot; It was widely believed in the early 1930sthat this served to hamper the reduction of tariffs on a basis of reciprocity.Countries A, B and C might agree that it would be to their mutual advantage.to admit one another&apos;s goods more freely; but they could not do this under the most-favoured-nation regime unless each of them was willing to reduce its duties also on imports from another country D, which might have just increased its tariffs on their goods from a high to a prohibitive level. This seemed unfair,particularly after the Hawley-Smoot tariff; and for countries with limitedmonetary reserves it might be dangerous. Several attempts were therefore madeto modify the clause, or to obtain agreed &quot; derogations &quot; from it, so as to removewhat had come to be regarded widely as an indefensible injustice.One of these attempts was a proposal which was blessed by the StresaConference of 1932 that the Danubian countries should be allowed to granttariff rebates to one another, other countries being asked to waive their most-favoured-nation rights so as to make this possible. Another was that knownas the Ouchy Convention. In 1932, Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg agreedto reduce their duties on each other&apos;s goods by 10 per cent, annually up to atotal, cut of 50 per cent., provided other countries would waive their most-favoured-nation rights. They further agreed that any State that wished couldaccede to the Convention and obtain its benefits on the same terms.Both these projects proved abortive. The chief obstacle to the OuchyConvention was the opposition of the United Kingdom; and this Opposition was directed against the principle, which, it was feared, might lead to seriouscomplications, of extending the privileges of the Convention to unspecifiedcountries. On the other hand, the British Government, though reserving theright to judge each case on its merits, did not offer any general objection topreferential arrangements between countries connected by &quot; historical and geographical ties.&quot; In other words the British Government opposed the ideaof &quot; low tariff clubs,&quot; but not that of regional preferential systems. Inpractice, the latter idea was equally barren of results.None the less, the movement of opinion in favour of these ideas in the 1930swas impressive. The lead in the movement towards &quot; low tariff clubs &quot; was taken,,as has been indicated, by Belgium, Holland and Luxemburg, i.e., by countries-with a low tariff reputation. resolutions in favour of new permanent exceptions to the most-favoured-nation clause were passed by a series of international conferences, including the Conference of American States at Montevideo in 1933.Recommendations in the same sense formed part of the so-called &quot;Van Zeeland* These advantages, it is worth noting, are tacitly admitted by. the critics, under cover ofthe name &quot;temptations.&quot; Thus the League of Nations booklet on Quantitative Trade Controlsobserves: &quot; It is easy to understand the temptation to cling to a method offering such precisionin the control of foreign competition &quot;and such a degree of certainty in the regulation of foreign trade.&quot; It says further: &quot;Never again such was the argument current among EuropeanGoveriimeiits in the middle thirties-.must the country&apos;s economic life be at the mercy offluctuations coming from abroad.&quot;
plan &apos;&apos; of 1938. The insistence on the need to modify the most-favoured-nation clause became part of the current internationalist ideology. The failure of this movement of opinion to achieve any tangible results was mainly a reflectionof the extreme difficulty of achieving practical results through the method ofmultilateral agreements.Meanwhile, in the British Commonwealth, Imperial Preference wasdeveloped from rudimentary beginnings into the comprehensive arrangements of the Ottawa Conference. The results proved somewhat disappointing to theDominions who had previously been the chief protagonists of Imperial Prefer-ence. The output of some of their major agricultural industries, notably wheat in Canada, and wool in Australia, had attained dimensions which far exceeded the aggregate demand of the United Kingdom. Whenever this was true,preferential tariffs were bound to prove nugatory. For a preference in theUnited Kingdom could do nothing to increase the price obtainable for that partof the Dominion output which had to be sold in other markets, and the pressure of competition forced down the price in the United Kingdom to the same level that could be obtained elsewhere. The gradual recognition of this factted to a reaction of opinion in the Dominions against the preferential idea, and towards the view that their interests lay in the direction of freer world trade.None the less, some important sections of Dominion agriculture derivedmaterial benefits from the Ottawa arrangements. The most substantial benefit,it is worth noting, was that which resulted from the preferential treatment ofDominion imports under the quantitative restrictions imposed by the UnitedKingdom on imports of meat.The preferential system was extended to the colonial empire, though somecolonies were unable to grant preferences owing to their obligations under the congo Basin treaties. The same difficulty, namely, that a large excess of Empireproduction over Empire demand renders preferences nugatory, applies to manycolonial products, e.g., cocoa. Thus the benefits and sacrifices of the preferentialsystem were unevenly spread, some colonies giving much more than they got, andothers getting much more than they gave. But the fact remains that the sugarcolonies in the West Indies and elsewhere were rescued from probable disaster bythe substantial preference on sugar granted by the United Kingdom and by canada.The British preferential arrangements aroused growing resentment in theUnited States. The mutual preferences between Canada and the UnitedKingdom were especially objectionable in American eyes, since they seemed toentail an unnatural diversion of trade which conflicted with the manifest destinyof the economic unity of the North American Continent. But dislike of thisparticular application was broadened into a general disapproval of the preferen-tial system, and led to a disposition, which has found insistent expression sincethe war began, to demand its abolition in the name of &quot; non-discrimination.&quot;, The story of the 1930s is pertinent at several points to the issue of policy that arises. On the one hand, it is certainly wise to go as far as possible inI modifying those parts of the preferential system which constitute a practical\ grievance to the United States; and the disillusionment of the Dominions with the potentialities of the British market, and their desire for freer access to theAmerican markets, are additional reasons in favour of this course.On the other hand, the revolt of opinion against the most-favoured-nation clause in the 1930s should warn us against regarding &quot; non-discrimination &quot;inthe narrow sense which the phrase usually carries, as synonymous with justice orfair-dealing. The traditional rules for non-discrimination involve distinctionswhich are far from equitable. It has always been customary to allow exceptionsfrom most-favoured-nation in favour of Customs Unions. In other words, theStates that form a Customs Union are allowed to discriminate in favour of eachother against the rest of the world in what may be an extreme degree. But smallneighbouring countries may have good reasons for seeking to cultivate closereconomic relations without wishing to go so far as a complete Customs Union.Mutual preferential concessions may often represent their most practicable roadtowards greater unity. To insist that they must do all or nothing, to blessCustoms Unions but to condemn preference, is doubtful policy. The distinctioncan be defended by various arguments on the place of practical convenience; butit cannot be justified by any clear or compelling principle of ethics.The application of the doctrine of non-discrimination to Imperial Preferenceinvolves similar anomalies. In some Empires the tariffs of the colonial territories are integrated, with those of the metropolitan countries in a common customssystem.   This arrangement is permissible under the non-discrimination formula,
though in fact it may entail the virtual exclusion of foreign traders from thesecolonial markets. But if this is to be treated as legitimate, it would be palpablyinequitable to forbid the less exclusive preferential relations which Great britain has developed with her colonies.Thus the doctrine of non-discrimination is far from being the simple matterbf justice which it is sometimes made to appear. On the other hand, complexsystems of differential tariff rates have practical disadvantages. Among them is their tendency to distort the price structure, and thus to make it more difficult forcountries. which rely on preferential duties&apos; in certain markets to competeeffectively in other markets. For this among other reasons it may perhaps prove that quantitative arrangements, conceivably on the basis of central purchase,may play a larger part, and preferential duties a smaller part, in future attempts to develop trade between countries which wish to draw nearer together.V. The Morals of the Story.(a) The Falsity of the Legend.In the foregoing pages the attempt has been made not only to describe theprincipal developments of the inter-war period, but to bring out their significance.Many of the more detailed lessons which emerge from the story have accordingly been sufficiently indicated, during its course. It seems, desirable, however, toattempt a summary of the major conclusions which constitute the central theme.In the first place, the legendary view, defined in the opening . action, which is so widely and so uncritically accepted by British and American opinion, is falsein all essential respects. It can only be made plausible by inverting the sequence of events, or by kaleidoscoping essentially different phases. The key event in the story is the monetary breakdown of 1931. That represents, as it were, a water-shed dividing the 1920s from the 1930s. After that breakdown it was inevitable that international trade should, be drastically reduced and that new measuresto defend currencies and protect industries should be widely adopted. But theworld economic crisis which led up to the monetary breakdown was preceded bypersistent and apparently successful attempts to restore a freely working inter-national system, to reduce tariffs or to check their increase, and to reviveinternational lending. It cannot be attributed, to an orgy of economic nationalismor trade restrictions. As Macaulay once said, &apos;&apos; post hoc, ergo propter hoc maybe bad reasoning; but ante hoc ergo non propter hoc is unanswerable.&quot;For the same reason, it is false to attribute the Axis will to war to trade barriers or measures of discrimination. Whether economic factors played any material part in causing the present war, or whether it is not sufficiently explained by the deep-rooted political ambitions of the Axis States combined with thedoctrinaire pacifism of the democracies, is a question upon which it is not easy to pronounce. In so far as any share of responsibility is attributable to economic policies, it belongs to the policies that led up to the world economic crisis and notto those which followed it. Had it not been for that crisis it is conceivable that hitler would never have gained power in Germany, and that the subsequent courseof world history would have been radically different. But to suppose that Hitlermight have pursued a peaceful policy, if foreign trade had been easier for germany, is surely to persist beyond pardonable measure in the illusions of the&quot;appeasement&quot; years. As for Japan and her grievance against the colonialquotas, the decisive fact is that she invaded Manchuria long before there were anysuch quotas, and before the Ottawa Conference was planned.It is more to the point to appreciate how greatly the Axis States were helped;in developing their strength for war, by the continuing attachment of the democracies to liberal commercial ideas. It was mainly from sources controlled by countries with which they intended or expected to be soon at war that both germany and Japan obtained the materials which they laid by as an indispehs-able war reserve; and it was after the prospect had become sO menacing that Onlythe most wishfully minded could seriously hope that peace would be maintained that they imported these materials in the largest quantities. The significance ofthis traffic was indeed unmistakable; yet it seemed impossible to interfere with itbecause this would have offended those principles of the liberal Commercial codewhich still inspired, respect. Thus there is better reason for holding that theremains of economic liberalism helped the Axis States to make war than that economic nationalism provoked them to it. ,:
(b) The Unwisdom of Repeating the 1920s.The history of the inter1-war period provides no support for the view thatwe should attempt once again to reconstruct a war-shattered world on the basisof a freely working economic system, international credits, the reduction of trade barriers, and the outlawry of quantitative regulation. To attempt this wouldbe not to learn from experience but to fly in its face. It would be to repeat themistakes made last time in the name of avoiding them. It would be to invite thesame failure, and the same disillusionment; the same economic&apos; chaos andthe same shock to social and political stability; the same discredit for theinternational idea. IThis is not to imply that those who threw their heart and energies into this attempt in the 1920s, whether in Central Banks, in the League of nations organisation, or elsewhere, have any cause to reproach themselves. They wouldhave needed almost superhuman insight and prescience to have discerned clearly that the conditions essential to the smooth working of the system they wererebuilding had passed away and could not be reproduced. The task they setthemselves seemed feasible, and they brought to it perseverance, judgment andexpert skill.  No other policy was practicable in the circumstances of the time.Stripped of their institutional trappings, the schemes which are emergingfrom the Anglo-American expert discussions closely resemble the policy pursued in the 1920s. Indeed, there are only two differences that seem material : Thefirst is that it is proposed for the future that countries should be allowed, and incertain circumstances required, to control capital movements. This undoubtedlyis a helpful change and a welcome concession to the teachings of experience. If,however, it is proper to regulate capital movements it becomes more difficult tosee why it should be improper to regulate anything else. After all, the capital movements of the inter-war period were not the ultimate source of trouble.They sprang from deeply-rooted maladjustments in the balance of internationalpayments. It must be expected that the present war will leave behind itmaladjustments on a still larger scale, which the control of capital movementswill do nothing to correct. Moreover, since the line between capital and currenttransactions is often blurred, it may be doubted whether a flight of capital couldbe effectively prevented in the contemplated laissez-faire environment.The second difference is that it is proposed in effect to replace deflation byexchange depreciation as the regulating spring of the international mechanism.That deflation can no longer serve this purpose is clear enough. Few countries,would be willing in future to make the volume of their internal purchasing-powerdepend on the magnitude of their gold reserves. It follows that it is also rightto make provision for altering exchange-rates so as to avoid large over-valuationsor under-valuations of particular currencies. But the experience of the inter-war years does not support the idea that exchange depreciation might provide an efficient substitute for deflation as the regulator of a quasi-automatic system,still less the idea that the alterations of exchange-rates which are to serve thiscritical purpose might be made the subject of amicable international decision.Of the various expedients which different Governments employed in the1930s, none produced more unfortunate results than deliberate exchange depreciation. It was the least helpful to the countries which tried it, and themost harmful to other countries. It is true that this was largely because theexpedient was intended in its most sensational use, namely, the devaluation ofthe dollar, to serve as an instrument of internal recovery rather than of inter-national equilibrium. None the less, to suppose that it could be used effectivelyfor the latter purpose, and for that purpose alone, through a procedure requiringgeneral international accord, is to expect a great deal. It has been seen above thatthe modus vivendi, by which the danger of an indefinite continuance ofcompetitive depreciation was avoided in the 1930s, was facilitated by the&quot;rigidity&quot; of the international trading system. If, however, conditions were established under which the postulates of abstract price theory were fulfilled, and export markets could be quickly swung away from country A to country B by an alteration of exchange-rates, it is difficult to imagine that the assent of country Ato the adjustment would be readily obtained. Nor, if such major economic conse-quences were involved, would the issue lend itself to quasi-judicial decision by anew-born international authority.The force of this criticism, it will be observed, turns on the extent to whichthe idea of a return to a liberal commercial system is realised. If the volumeof internal currency cannot in future be made to depend in most countries ohmonetary reserves, it is clear that exchange-rates may have to be changed fronitime to time; and a procedure for securing that such changes are made so far
:as possible by international agreement is certainly to be desired. It is not un-reasonable to hope that this procedure might work with sufficient smoothness ifexchange-rates can be varied without affecting radically and decisively the flow of trade, the stability of important industries and the livelihood and employmentof large masses of men and, women. But if this condition is to be satisfied, it isessential that the postulates of abstract price theory should not be fulfilled, andthat human welfare should be protected by a reasonable degree of &quot;rigidity &quot;against violent change.In other words, inter-war experience suggests that exchange-rate alterationscannot serve as the mainspring of a self-adjusting system. Once it is granted that deflation must be thrown on the scrap-heap, the self-adjusting international system is destroyed, and it may become necessary for the individual country toregulate its balance of payments by deliberate action. Moreover, this may benecessary, not only in occasional emergencies, but as a continuing policy, so thatequilibrium, once re-esfablishecl, may be maintained.(c) The Conditions of International Economic Order.This leads to the positive lessons which are to be learnt from inter-war experience. Some measure of support can be drawn from it for many con-clusions and many courses of action, the truth or wisdom of which may yet be doubtful. The following catalogue is confined to the lessons that seem reasonablyclear : (1) The first lesson is the fundamental importance to any orderly inter-national economic life of the objective of equilibrium in the balance of payments.In the long run, no country can expect in peace to import from outside morethan it can pay for by means of its exports of goods and services or as interest on its investments. Hazy notions that the international economic system mightbe based on some different assumption are illusory, and attempts to base policyupon them can only lead to harm. The world is not nearly ripe for any applica-tion of the principle of communism as between countries; the principle, that isto say, of &quot; From each country according to its ability; to each countryaccording to its needs.&quot; This principle can be applied in some degree betweenallies during war, united by the common purpose of the defeat of a commonenemy, and with varying capacities to contribute to this task by military andeconomic means. It is chimerical as a basis for peace-time international relations.(2) The second lesson relates to the uses and abuses of financial aid. It maybe of great help to a country, which is short of international purchasing-powerand faced with a large deficit on its balance of payments, to obtain credits or financial accommodation in some form either from a strongly-placed country orfrom an international institution. This assistance may relieve the intensity ofthe immediate pressure on the country in difficulties, and supply it with abreathing-space in which it can adjust its import-export balance gradually, andthus cause less hardship to its own population and less damage to the trade interests-of others. But whatever form the assistance takes, it will do mischiefif it is used to evade the task of adjustment. If, therefore, it is given subject to conditions which seriously fetter the power of the country receiving it to bringits import bill within its international income, it is a doubtful blessing. One ofthe chief economic duties which a country, like an individual, owes to itsneighbours is to live within its means; and in general no country should berestrained or discouraged from taking any step which in the opinion of itsresponsible authorities is essential for this purpose.(3) Next, the marked trend towards an increasing degree of collectiveorganisation and State intervention in internal economic affairs must necessarilyexert a far-reaching influence on external economic policies. The idea of greatereconomic security is fundamentally incompatible with that of an unregulatedexternal economy. If a country&apos;s economic life is to be rendered reasonablystable, it may be essential to safeguard it against extreme disturbance from thevicissitudes of foreign markets. No country which makes the maintenance of full employment one of its major aims can abdicate its authority to check anabnormal flood of imports which threatens to disorganise employment. Nor cana, food-importing country which contemplates new ambitious social policies,e.g., for improved nutrition, divest itself of the right to give essential importsa first claim on its exchange resources.(4) Although quantitative methods of regulation have their defects, limita-tions and dangers, they are appropriate and useful for a large range of purposes.
Whenever economic security is the object, or whenever trie-problem is to effect alarge-scale readjustment with the minimum of disturbance, quantitative regula-tion is far superior to tariffs, subsidies, or the manipulation of exchange-rates.It can provide a reliable safeguard against violent change and a consideratemeans of effecting gradual change. It is in harmony with the trend of modern,development, e.g., in agricultural marketing technique, and with the idea of planning. It is in harmony also with the deeper human urge to set reasonable limits to the arbitrary power of money over economic life. - -(5) Finally, the task of statesmanship is to build a new international economic order on the basis of freedom for individual countries to regulate theirexternal economies effectively. The old international order of the nineteenth century was based on laisser-faire and has broken down for good. Nothing butfailure, futility and frustration can come from the attempt to set it up again.The problem is to devise a code of international good behaviour which will fit theconditions, the needs, and the aspirations of the modern world. There is nofundamental reason why we should not gradually evolve a working solution ofthis problem if we recognise it for what it is. But we shall greatly increase thedifficulties of doing so if we persist in associating the idea of international economic co-operation with the subordination of human welfare to the absoluterule^oi market forces, under the influence of doctrinaire abstractions, misplacedidealism, and nostalgia for the past.3rd December, 1943.
