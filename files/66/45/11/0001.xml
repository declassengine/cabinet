This recommendation follows from the foreseen necessity ofproviding additional labour and resources of material and equipment&quot;when the final period of build-up for the attack arrives, anaduring the launching of the assault.&quot; and Cabinet approval is sought to the principle of diversion from other production or services during the period of the operations,3*      The Ministry&apos;s requirements for labour do not, however, relateonly to the period of the operation^      For reasons given para. 1+many .of them have already become urgent, and their satisfaction atan early date is a necessity in order that conditions may beestablished in which the handling of shipping, clearance of ports,and internal transport during the invasion period can be successfullycarried out.k*      Since w.p .(U4)2 only seeks Cabinet approval of a principle,and proposes that Ministries concerned should get together in examining special requirements? itstage to state in general terms ourdue to invasion plans s andthat they should be met as for the invasion periodcbrieflysoon as appears only necessary at this additional labour requirements to explain why it is necessarypossible and why they cannot wait1 *    Labour for Railways.It is necessary to reinforce railway labour immediately so asto remove the present shortage and to be ready to cope with theincreased traffic of the operation^ including- the large additional demand due to the withdrawal of coasting shipping for the operation.It is estimated:(a)To meet presen^.Q.perai.retraining,..^hCir^.ges, the additionaloperational&quot;requirements,  and replace wastage, thereis required over the next 6 months...........29,UOO menof which drivers, firemen, locomotive runningshed grades, shunters, goods grades andsignalmen (11.300in all) are of special urgency.mTo meet constructionincluding wastageand repair requirementsO O   0   o   O 3   Oe o   o  o*****7,000 menII.

It is estimated that there .will be required for this work..........................1,000 men.IV.    Dock labour for invasion operations it is necessary largely to increaseloading and bunkering labour at all the operational ports.     These.iave not yet been finally decided, but it has&apos; been decided that &apos;the transfer of additional civilian labour to operational ports isnot practicable.     On present invasion plans, it is estimated atotal military and civil force of 15,000 men is required, of which about 9*000 (military and civil) are available at present.     Theshortage is therefore.................................^,000 men/7but the whole shortage in view of the above decision would be amilitary commitment.In addition, civilian labour is required as soon as possible,in order to complete requirements, the meeting of which has alreadybeen authorised by the Minister of Labour, and to meet additional demands, due to increased Import and Bolero programmes in thepre-invasion months.     It is essential we should not find ourselvesat the start of the invasion operations period with any congestionat any U.K. ports.These additional civilian requirements viz to reach target figure already approved (U,000) and additional demands (1,900)are................................................... 5,900 men(These requirements are for Hull, Manchester, and Southampton,where the greatest difficulty in recruiting is found and forLiverpool, Bristol and Avonmouth, South Wales and Clyde).L.MINISTRY OF WAR TRANSPORT.11th January 19kk*
