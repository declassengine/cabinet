this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for, the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET. &apos;   Copy No.w.p. (44) 47.. ^ -/   &apos;23rd January, 1944. ....WAR CABINET. /DRAFT   AGREEMENT   WITH   THE   POLISH   GOVERNMENT   FORMILITARY SUPPLIES AND FOR THE POLISH AIR FORCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WE have concluded a number of &quot; Forces &apos;&apos; Agreements with the AlliedGovernments established in this country for the formation and maintenance oftheir forces under the British High Command. It was found necessary to include in some of these Agreements provisions to assist in the financing of the require-ments of these forces and it was decided to allow them to have on lend-lease termsall equipment and other war materials. Provisions to this effect were inserted in the Agreement with the Greek Government concluded on the 12th March, 1942.&quot; Forces &quot; Agreements with the Czechoslovak and Polish Governments had already-been concluded at the time when this decision was taken, but for reasons offinancial convenience it became necessary to make additional agreements withthem, granting them lend-lease terms for the supply of their military equipment.Such a supplementary agreement was concluded with the czechoslovak government on the 21st January, 1943.2. Negotiations with the Polish Government began in March 1943 and adraft Agreement, in the terms of which all the interested Departments concur,has now been drawn up and could be submitted to the Polish Government very shortly. It is anticipated that they will agree. The lend-lease provisions ofthe Agreement will have retroactive effect from the 3rd June, 1940, the date uponwhich the Polish military credit was opened This in effect involves the cancellation-tion of about  100 million of Polish debt, which has been incurred for military supplies. A somewhat similar cancellation of debt has been given to the french committee of National Liberation.3. M. Maisky displayed great interest in the Czechoslovak Agreement,because it contained a detailed provision for the ^furnishing of reciprocal aid to any United Kingdom forces who might be in Czechoslovakia. It will thereforebe desirable to inform the Soviet Ambassador about the conclusion of the presentPolish Agreement, since it contains a similar though less definite provision to.that in the Czechoslovak Agreement to the following effect : &quot; The attribution of any expenditure which might arise from thepresence of the forces of the United Kingdom in Poland, would be deter-in ined by the Government of the Republic of Poland and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in consultation.&quot;4. In addition to informing the Soviet Ambassador, I understand that theChancellor of the Exchequer would like to make a statement in the House at thetime of the signing of the Agreement, since it involves the cancellation of a large amount of Polish debt.  -5. I should also mention that my Department, and the Air Ministry havebeen negotiating for some time a revision of the Air Force Appendix of the polish forces Agreement granting the Poles a greater degree of autonomy in theadministration of their Air Force. A text has been agreed between the AirMinistry and the Polish Air Force authorities, but has not yet been presented tothe Polish Government on the diplomatic level.   It is anticipated that the Poles12255   [26774]
will also be willing to sign this Agreement without further delay. We can arrange that there will be no publicity given to this Agreement on our side, but it wouldbe as well to inform the Soviet Ambassador about it also.6. I regard both these Agreements as purely internal matter in theadministration of the forces which are at present under our command, and I am satisfied that the Soviet Government would have no right to object or even tocomplain at their conclusion. The mere fact of concluding two formal agreements with the Polish Government at this particular moment might be represented as having a special significance, but I consider that we should proceed with both.I have, however, thought it necessary to inform my colleagues before proceeding to signature, which will probably be within the next month.A. E.Foreign Office, January 23, 1944.
