THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.Si.     dQ     sO-i^vMMOST secret copy -No.W.P. (44) 3.3rd January, 1944.WAR CABINET.DIRECTIVE ON CONSTITUTIONAL POLICY IN malaya and BORNEO.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theSecretary of State for War.1;. As our colleagues are aware, steps were taken some time ago to commencethe planning of the Administration of Malaya and Borneo, after reoccupation.This planning is being conducted under the War Office in close association withthe Colonial Office and has made considerable progress. A Chief Civil AffairsOfficer for Malaya has already been selected, and under him the nucleus of thefuture Malayan Administration during military period is in the course of assembly in this country. A similar nucleus Administration for all the territories concerned in Borneo is also being collected here.2. The detailed planning work on which these bodies are engaged must be governed by the general intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the future,since it is important that, if possible, nothing should be said or done at thebeginning of the reoccupation period which is incompatible with the long-term policy which we intend to adopt. This work of detailed planning has now reached the stage at which the planners find themselves in need of authqritativeguidance on the broad issues of long-term policy, and in our view it is now necessary that a preliminary decision should be taken as to the future constitutional and administrative systems for the territories concerned. Thereis, of course, no necessity for any public announcement at this juncture.3. There are many problems, some of considerable complexity, to be faced in determining the future system.   For example, there are &apos;(a) the position of our Treaties with the Malay rulers who, though subjectto extensive political control, are yet in the position of sovereignprinces;(&amp;) the positions of the territories in Borneo which comprise Labuan, aBritish Colony, Brunei, whose position is similar.to a Malay State,Sarawak under the sovereignty of a European Rajah and north borneo under a Chartered Company;(c) the participation of the important Chinese and Indian communities inthe local government institutions of the country, in view of theattitude of the Malay rulers to Asiatics who are not of Malay race orMohammedan religion.It is clear that problems of this magnitude will raise great political and legal difficulties and our decisions upon them will attract widespread attentionboth in this country and in the United States.4. For that reason it would, we think, be most helpful if a CabinetCommittee could consider the full proposals which we are prepared to put beforethem, and, in the light of those full proposals, recommend to the Cabinet a directive upon which the planning authorities could base their work.3rd January, 1944.[26663^1]O.
