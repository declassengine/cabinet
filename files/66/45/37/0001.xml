// /THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 37..18 if A January, 1944WAR CABINET.&apos; SEVENTH REPORT OF THE SHIPPING COMMITTEE.1. In our Sixth Report, written in August (S.C. (43) 103) we anticipatedthat imports in 1943 would amount to some 26 million tons, of which some24-3 million tons would be consumed, and 1-7 million tons added to stocks. Atthe same time we indicated that achievement of the 26 million tons might be prejudiced to the extent of some \ million tons by shortage of effective supplies available for import to the United Kingdom from North America during thelatter part of the year. Loadings of cargo from North America have, in fact,fallen short of the total originally planned by about 5/600,000 tons, mainly due to shortage of available cargo. Nevertheless, it now appears likely, thanks,largely, to the low level of losses at sea, that the 26 million ton import target willbe attained and even exceeded by over 300,000 tons. Moreover, net consumptionof imports has fallen substantially short of earlier expectations, with the resultthat stocks at end 1943 are now expected to be almost 1 - 2 million tons above theearlier forecast, making a total increase of almost 2 - 9 million tons over the year.Estimated totals of imports, net consumption and stock changes for 1943 are shown in the following table : JCopy No.Million tons.Net Consumption StockImports.      of Imports.

Stocks of food are now at higher levels than they have ever been in thecourse of this war. Stocks of materials have now recovered more than two-thirds of the losses which they suffered between the end of 1941 and the spring ofthis year.* Figures shown for food in line (a) are based on Ministry of Food arrivals estimates andrelate to a period of 53 weeks. These are the figures normally used and quoted by the Ministryof Food. Food figures shown in line (b) have been calculated to correspond approximately tothe other figures in the table which are based on import estimates and relate to the calendar year.[26727] b
Prospects for 1944.Imports.3. In present circumstances the volume of imports which we are able to achieve in any period depends primarily on the volume of United States tonnageassigned to our assistance as part of the Combined planning of United Nationsshipping resources. At the recent Cairo Conference (&quot; Sextant &quot;) a shipping-budget was worked out on a United Nations basis for the first nine monthsof 194-4. On the expectation of an import of some 26 million tons in 1943,United Kingdom import requirements in 1944 were taken provisionally at26 million tons; of this 12-^ million tons were assumed to be imported in the first half of the year, and 6f million tons in the third quarter. The american representatives, however, admitted the 26 million import programme only on the clear understanding that the possibility of a substantial reduction would be closely and urgently studied.4. It was estimated on the basis of assumptions which are explained inAppendix A that the tonnage under our own control (including the 200 vesselsbareboated to us by the W.SA.) after taking account of the imports to be broughtto the United Kingdom in &apos;&apos; Bolero &apos;&apos; ships, and of the customary sailings of w.S.A. vessels to South and East Africa, Australia and New Zealand, would fall short of the tonnage required to fulfil our responsibilities by some 2-7 milliondeadweight tons of shipping in the first half of 1944, and by some 2-85 milliondeadweight tons of shipping in the second half of the year. The amount ofassistance which the Americans have so far proposed to meet this deficiency fallsshort of our requirements by the equivalent of some 250,000 tons of imports inthe first half of 1944 and of some 330,000: tons of imports in the third quarter ofthe year. It is, however, the view of the Ministry of War Transport and of theWar Shipping Administration that these deficits are capable, in practice, ofbeing resolved, subject, however, to the circumstances to which attention is drawn in paragraphs 5 and 6 below. What will happen in the fourth quarter cannot now be foreseen, ^but, in view of the expanding claims of the Pacific War, theshipping stringency may be at least as great as during the third quarter.5. If United States assistance were forthcoming as set out in the previous paragraph, our imports might be about 25 million tons, but as matters now standwe cannot be certain of importing even this amount in 1944. The shipping plansmade at the Cairo Conference explicitly exclude from consideration any claims that may be made on shipping for the purpose of bringing civilian supplies to europe, apart from small quantities which may be provided under initialoperational programmes and certain supplies for Italy, cf. paragraph 15 below.6. Moreover, the capacity of the United Kingdom ports and the facilitiesfor distribution by the various forms of inland transport will be severely strainedin the first quarter of the year and even more severely strained in the second quarter. These limitations may make it necessary to.adjust the rate of importto a figure well below 12 million tons as against the import of 12-1 million tonsassumed in paragraph 3 above- in the first half of the year. Difficulties of storage in respect of food are already being encountered. In view of the shipping situation, we cannot hope with any confidence that a short fall in assumed imports in the first 6 months could be made good by the end of the year.Alternative Import Programmes.7. In our previous reports we have been accustomed to put forwardestimates of import requirements, and to compare these with the importing capacity of the shipping in our service. For 1944, however, it is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate import requirements. What our requirements are depends on whether the war in Europe is expected to last throughout 1944, on theemergency calls likely to be made on supplies from this country for the purposeof European Relief, and on the level of stocks which it is deemed proper to holdat the end of 1944. What the level of stocks should be will depend in turn on what shipping and supply conditions are expected to be in 1945. In face ofthese uncertainties, we have thought it preferable to present an import programme of 26 million tons with a tentative Departmental allocation, and toshow the consequences which such a programme, so divided, would have on stocks.We have then gone on to indicate what the effect might be if we were forced to cut this programme by \\ million tons to 24^ million tons.8. Out of an import programme of 26 million tons, 11^ million tons should,we suggest, be allotted to food, 12 million tons to materials,, and 2f million tons
to munitions and miscellaneous manufactures.* The following table shows howsuch a programme would affect the level of stocks : (Million tons.)Net Change in imports.      Consumption.       Stocks.Food ...      ......      11-25 10-89 -h  -36Materials     ......      12 00 13-04 -1 04Munitions, &amp;c.       ...        2-75 2-75Total     ......      26-00 26-68 -  -689. An analysis of these figures by groups of commodities will be found inAppendix B. Net consumption of imports has been calculated on the assumptionthat the war with Germany will continue throughout 1944. Had it been assumed that the war would end during 1944 consumption would have been put rather higher to allow for some improvement on the war-time diet and some expansion in building and other forms of civilian consumption. On the other hand theimport of munitions would have been less.10. The increase of some 1^ million tons in the estimated Net Consumptionof food in 1944 as compared to 1943 is largely due to (a) the inclusion of a specialimport of 300,000 tons of extra feeding stuffs for livestock, (p) an expansion in consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables together with small changes in other items, and (c) an assumed falling off in supplies of food from farms in 1944 ascompared with 1943 of about 500,000 tons. The expansion in imports of feedingstuffs is for the purpose of increasing the production of livestock products,particularly milk, bacon and eggs, and is justified by the deterioration in the worldlivestock position and by the prospect of additional demands on. world supplies,arising on account of European Relief. Food stocks at end 1944 would, on thiscomputation, slightly exceed the fairly satisfactory total attained by end 1943,but it has to be borne in mind that there may be emergency calls on these stocks for purposes of European relief.11. The increase of over a million tons in estimated net consumption of imported materials in 1944 as compared with 1943 is largely due.to an increased consumption of soft-woods, fertilisers, synthetic rubber, and imported iron-ore,,etc., and to a decline of about one million tons in the home production of timber.Stocks would fall during 1944 by about one million tons and if anticipationsregarding net consumption are fulfilled would at the end of the year be slightlybelow the level of end 1942.12. It would be unrealistic, in view of the prospects as disclosed in para-graphs 3 to 6 of this Report, not to take account of the possibility that the import programmes may have to be compressed below the level of 26 million tons. If thefigure should turn out to be as low as 24^ million tons we believe an appropriatedistribution would be : 10^ million tons for food, 11^ million tons for materials,and 2f million tons for munitions, etc. If departmental imports were cut tothese levels the reduction would fall partly on net consumption and partly onstocks, as shown below. Net consumption would, however, still be substantially higher than in 1943.(Million tons.)NetImports,  consumption      stock of Imports.     changes.Food .........      10-50 10-59      -     09Materials   ...      ...      ...      11-25 12-84      - 1-59Munitions, &amp;c.......        2-75 2-75Total ...      24-50 26-18      - 1-6813. Net consumption of food would be reduced by 300,000 tons in the10^-million-ton import programme as compared to the 11^-million-ton programme.This is attributable to the exclusion of the special import of animal feed, despite* It is too early to consider what, adjustments may be necessary to these allocations toallow for the excess of imports in 1943 over 26 million tons.[26727] b 2
the strong reasons put forward in paragraph 10 above for importing a certainamount of feeding stuffs in 1944. End 1944 food-stocks would be some 1 - 8 million tons above the level attained at the end of ,1942, which is considered the minimum required under war conditions, and would be higher than at the end of any yearprevious to 1943. This level of stocks, however, must be judged in relation to the expectation of future world shortages in certain major foodstuffs, and to thedesirability, from the point of view of the intensive food production drive invarious territories, of moving supplies from the country of origin as they become available. Moreover it is considered important to maintain United Kingdomstocks at the highest possible levels since in no other country is food control socomplete as to ensure that the food will be conserved.14. Net consumption of materials is down by 200,000 tons in the 11^-million-tons import programme as compared with the 12-million-ton programme. This isdue to a cut in the consumption of imported iron-ore. The aggregate stock level at end 1944 will be some 700,000 tons below end 1942, and about 2-3 million tonsabove the bare distributional level, i.e., the minimum level necessary to secure asmooth flow of supplies to manufacturers under ordinary wartime conditions.Availability of Supplies.15. We have recently looked into the question of the availability of world supplies to meet the various United Nations import programmes in 1944. If therequirements for the Relief&quot; of Europe were confined to such demands as were taken into account at Cairo for the purpose of calculating the shipping require-ments of the United Nations no serious problem of availability of supplies for theUnited Kingdom import programme either of food or of materials would be likelyto arise. But if, as we had assumed on the basis of recent (though highlyspeculative) estimates European requirements are of the order of 8-10 million tonsof food, 9 million tons of materials and 16 million tons of coal, and if Russianrequirements are of the order of 2^ million tons of food, and 1^ million tons ofmaterials, supply &quot;difficulties are likely to be in some respects serious. Forexample, certain foods would be short, notably meat, milk, fats and even sugar;while, failing access to Scandinavian and Baltic supplies there would bedeficiencies in timber and wood pulp. These supply shortages would, of course,have repercussions on all the United Nations import programmes, including ourown, and would tend to reduce the prospective demands on shipping. A roughcalculation would indicate that limitations of supply might force down united nations import requirements, including those of a liberated Europe, by some 4^ to5 million tons. Even, however, if this entire short-fall were presumed to fall onthe European requirements, the latter would still present a very considerablepotential claim on shipping which, as has been pointed out in paragraph 5 above,has only been allowed for to a very limited extent in the shipping calculations atCairo. As far as can be seen therefore at the present time, shortage of supplies is not likely to become a limiting factor in our import programme.Conclusion.16.- In view of the many uncertainties affecting the position in 1944 we feelthat it is too early to reach final conclusions regarding the total import programme for the year. Nevertheless, we recommend that 26 million tons should continue tobe regarded as the proper target for 1944, and that it should be divided betweenDejjartments as suggested in paragraph 8 above, viz. : (Million tons.)Munitions, &amp;c.      ...       ...       ...       ... 2-75Food .........       ...... 11-25Materials    ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 12-0017. It is also necessary for practical reasons to make some assumptionsregarding the level of imports during the first half of the year, and reach some decision about the apportionment of imports between Departments.18. In view of the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 3 to 6 above, wethink it imprudent to assume a level of imports exceeding 12 million tons in&apos; thefirst half of 1944. Indeed, for the reasons indicated the import may well fall below that figure. Should imports in the first half of 1944 seem likely to fall below 11 million tons a revision of the shipping programmes of the United&apos; nations would become necessary.
19. We recommend that first priority in the allocation of importing capacityshould be given, as heretofore, to munitions, &amp;c, and that, so far as circumstances permit, and subject to the recommendation in paragraph 20 below, imports offood should have second priority up to a total of 5^ million tons, within the six months period. The remaining importing capacity should be allotted to theimport of materials. Assuming an import of munitions, &amp;c, amounting to1 - 4 million tons, an import of food amounting to 5\ million tons, and a totalimport of 12 million tons, import of materials would amount to some 5 - 35 million tons. &apos;20. If, however, the aggregate volume of imports accruing to food and materials under this formula should fall short of 10-6 million tons (i.e., 5-25 tonsof food and 5-35 tons of materials), we recommend that the shortfall should be divided between food and materials in the ratio of 4 to 6.Signed on behalf of the Committee :HARCOURT JOHNSTONE, Chairman.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18th January, 1944.
APPENDIX A.Principal Assumptions underlying estimates oe non-tanker imports intothe&quot; United Kingdom in 1944.The estimate of United Kingdom imports, amounting to some 26 million tons in 1944, which, as stated in paragraph 3 of the Report, was provisionallyadopted as part of the United Nations shipping budget worked out at Cairo,is based on the following assumptions : (a) That the average amount of British controlled non-tanker ocean-goingtonnage (including certain &apos;&apos; free &apos;&apos; tonnage operating in british interests) available in the first half of 1944 will be 20 - 85 milliondeadweight tons and in the second half 21 - 30 million dead-weight tons. In making this estimate the loss rates agreed bythe Combined Chiefs of Staff as applicable to all United Nationstonnage have been applied pro rata to British controlled tonnage.The figures take account of the 200 United States vessels which arebeing transferred during 1943 and the first half of 1944 to the british flag on bareboat charter.(b) That 2-60 million deadweight tons and 2-65 million deadweight tonsof the available tonnage will, on average, be undergoing or awaitingrepair during the first and second halves of the year respectively.(c) That 3-55 million deadweight tons will be engaged on average through-&apos;   out the year in maintaining the war-making capacity of areas ofBritish responsibility abroad, or in United Kingdom coasting.(d) That  3 - 05 million deadweight tons will be required for  military purposes, including trooping, in which they will have a very small,   importing value.(e) That tonnage employed on sailings from the United Kingdom and theUnited States to the Eastern ,and Western Mediterranean, indian and Persian Gulf theatres and to North Russia and Turkey, on british account, will on average amount to 5-90 million deadweighttons throughout the year.(/) That tonnage employed for various other military purposes on averagewill amount to 1-05 million deadweight tons during the first half ofthe year and 1-40 million tons during the second half of the year.(g) That after allowing for (i) Imports in &quot;Bolero&quot; vessels, (ii) miscel-laneous imports in shipping covered under item id) above, (iii) UnitedStates assistance hitherto received in the form of sailings from.North America to the Dominions, the tonnage required to be con-tinuously employed for achievement of the 26 million tons will amount to 7-40 million deadweight tons during the first halfand 7 - 60 during the second half of the year. Of this,2-70 million deadweight tons during the first half and 2-85 milliondeadweight tons during the second half will need to be covered by united States Assistance partly in the form of direct imports to theUnited Kingdom and partly in the form of sailings to other areasagainst commitments referred to in ie) above.Note. As stated in paragraph 3 of the Report, the calculations above are based on an import of some 12-^ million tons during the first half ofthe year, but events may make the achievement of such an importimpracticable, owing to the factors referred to in paragraph 6 of theReport.
