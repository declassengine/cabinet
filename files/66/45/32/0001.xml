THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF his BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPTinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET. Copy No.       3 5W.P. (44) 32. Ilith January, 1944. WWAR CABINET.LONDON AIRFIELD FOR TRANSPORT PURPOSES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. The Report (W.P. (43) 517) submitted by the War Cabinet Committeewhich was appointed to examine my proposals for the establishment of a newairfield at Heathrow recommended that the Air Ministry should be authorisedto proceed with Stage 1 of the scheme at an estimated cost of  5 million, subjectto the following conditions : *(a) that the Air Ministry were satisfied that the labour required could bemade available from their allocation of building labour; and(b) that satisfactory assurances could be given that none of the factories which would have to be dislodged was of special importance from thepoint of view of war production.I was also asked by the Committee 1(c) to consider whether it would be possible to surrender other airfields,particularly that at tleston, so as to reduce the Joss to agricultureinvolved in the proposals.2. The Committee concluded that no case had been made out on military grounds for authorising the work to proceed up to the end of Stage 2 and recommended that a decision as to both Stages 2 and 3 should be deferred untilthe Air Ministry scheme for the development of civil airports after the war hadbeen prepared.3.   To take first sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (e) of paragraph 1 above : (a) I confirm that it will not be necessary to ask for any further labourallocation.(b) The eight factories and works to be demolished at Stage 1 are : Fairey&apos;sAviation Works, the Magnotex factory, a paper cap factory, a saw-mill, a timber yard and three gravel works.Except for the first two factories, the Departments concerned areprepared to accept the loss of production. The Magnotex factory is engaged on fairly important work for the Ministry of Supply, whostate, however, that alternative capacity can be arranged. TheMinistry of Aircraft Production require alternative accommodation(mainly erection hangars) for Fairey&apos;s works. This problem has been carefully considered and it has been found that there is no alternative but to site the accommodation initially at Heston. The change fromthe old to the new site will not involve any loss in production.(c) It will not be possible to surrender any airfields before the end of the warwith Germany. Thereafter, a number of airfields will become surplus to the needs of the R.A.F. and some of them will certainly revert to agriculture. In the London area, so far as can at present be fore-seen, two airfields, comprising a total of 500 to 600 acres, could begiven up. Whether any more airfields in the London area could bemade available for agriculture depends largely on the needs of london for civil aviation, which have not yet been finally assessed. It will,of course, be possible for some of the land between runways at heathrow to be used for market gardening, as is the case at R.A.F.stations.[26732]
As for Heston, the R.A.F. will not require this airfield after theend of the German war; and as the air traffic at Heathrow reacheslarge proportions (in. say, three or four years&apos; time), Fairey&apos;s workswould have to be removed from Heston owing to the interference withtest flying. Thus it is possible that at a later stage the land will beavailable for agriculture. On the other hand, if the full air trafficneeds of London cannot be otherwise met, it might prove to be a convenient and businesslike arrangement to keep Heston in use for short-range traffic feeding the main trans-oceanic terminal at heathrow, provided the two airfields could be operated under a singleflying-control system. I can give no assurance one way or the other atthis stage. ... .4. To come now to Stage 2. Even if the war with Germany ends this year,it is impossible to predict how long the war with Japan will continue. And forthe war with Japan air transport will be more than ever vital. As I stated in w.P. (43) 482, it is expected that the 250,000 lb. transport aircraft will be in use by 1946; and for this type runways of 5,000 yards are necessary if all-weatherservices are to be maintained. The main runway at St. Mawgan cannot beextended beyond 3,000 yards, or that at L3meham beyond 3,200 yards; and whilethe main runway at Prestwick could be extended to about 5 miles, extensionbeyond 3,000 yards would involve major works in carrying it over a road and railway. Moreover, this airfield is 350 miles from London. There is therefore,in my opinion, a military requirement for Stage 2 at Heathrow.There-is a further consideration. For the construction of Stage 2 it will benecessary to use the land at present occupied by the Middlesex County CouncilSludge Disposal Works at Ferry Oaks. Construction of these works is under-stood to have taken two years, and the removal of the works to another site andthe construction of alternative works will have to be put in hand at the beginningof Stage 1 if delay at Stage 2 is to be avoided. The War Cabinet Committeehave already recommended that the Minister of Health should be authorised to invite the Middlesex County Council to examine the possibility of providing a newsludge disposal works to replace the one at Heathrow and to find out how longreplacement would take.I accordingly ask that authority should now be given tc the Air Ministry toproceed with Stage 2 of Heathrow when Stage 1 is completed and meanwhile toundertake the necessary. preliminaries. It is estimated that Stage 1 will take some 14 months.5. There remains Stage 3. Though a detailed plan for the airports whichwill be required for civil purposes after the war cannot yet be submitted, I attachas an Appendix a summary of the principles on which the Air Ministry is proceeding. This will, I hope, suffice to give a general indication of the extentof the commitment which is likely to fall on the Exchequer. Whatever trans-oceanic airfields are required in other parts of the country and as the Appendixshows the number will, in any event, be very small- it is unthinkable that thereshould not be one in &quot;the London area. Certainly, if one is not provided near london, some continental centre such as Paris will become the main airport fortrans-Atlantic and other long-distance international air services from whichfeeder lines would radiate to the other European centres of population. Such a development would, be detrimental to the long-term interests of this country.While work on Stage 3 cannot be started for some time to come, it would materially assist planning if a decision in principle could be taken now thatHeathrow should be developed in due course as a main terminal airport capableof accommodating the latest types of transport aircraft in regular operation bythe airlines of the world.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, 14th January, 1944.
APPENDIX.POST-WAR CIVIL AIRPORTS.1. General statement of requirements.Civil airports may be broadly classified into the following three categories : (a) Main terminal airports serving trans-ocean and Imperial, as wellas continental, traffic.(b) Airports adjoining large cities which will cater for some continentaltraffic but will be mainly used for internal services; and(c) Airfields for internal traffic only and for private flying.2. Category (a).Airports in category (a) will be national assets and the cost of construction and maintenance will have to be borne &quot;by the State. Very few airports of this size will, however, be required. Indeed, it is unlikely that, in addition toHeathrow, more than three others will be needed. Of these, one and perhapstwo will be mainly needed as alternative airports when weather conditions atthe main airport are unfavourable and the buildings constructed on them canbe on a more modest scale. One of the additional trans-oceanic airports might bePrestwick, which has already been developed on a considerable scale, is regarded with great pride in Scotland and would serve a substantial population inScotland and the North of England. The cost of extending the runways would,however, be very heavy. A second might be one of the war-time airfields in north Wales or Cornwall-, which have been developed to meet the needs of theRoyal Air Force Transport Command. If a third is required, an existingairfield could probably be found which, with extension, would meet requirements.3. Category (b).The provision of airports in this category was before the war the financial responsibility of local authorities, though the State provided certain servicesfree of cost, such as air traffic control and radio and meteorological reports.There is no reason why this policy should not be continued and- there is no&apos;evidence that local authorities will be reluctant to shoulder their responsibilities.4. Category (c).Here again it is right that local authorities who want to have airfields for local needs should bear the cost themselves. State assistance would, however,be necessary in certain areas, such as the West of Scotland, if air communica-tion had to be provided as a service to the community and the local authority was unable to carry the cost.5. Special requirements of the London area.London, as the metropolis and the centre of the Empire, presents a special problem and its airport requirements are exceptional. It will probably require,in addition to Heathrow, two or more terminal airfields capable of handlingcontinental as well as internal traffic.Before the war, the State had provided and operated two London airports,one at Croydon, which is not capable of any substantial development, and theother at Heston, which is so close to Heathrow that its use when Heathrow isfunctioning may no longer be possible. In addition, the City of London hadv.. undertaken the development of an airfield at Fairlop in Essex. This site hasbeen developed during the war as a Royal Air Force airfield, and it is reasonable to assume that after the war the City of London will be ready to convert it to an up-to-date civil airport.6. Additional services.The Air Ministry will undoubtedly be expected to continue after the war to provide essential technical services for all airfields. These consisted, beforethe war, of air traffic control, and radio and meteorological services and were provided on an area as distinct from an airfield basis. Their annual cost, onthe basis of 53 airfields in operation, was expected to be  312,000 per annumwhen the services were fully operative.    Of this sum,  226,000 was for staff.
Air Ministry, lith January, 1944.No estimate of the post-war cost of these services can be made at the presenttime, but it will inevitably be greater than the pre-war figure, especially as therewill be a considerable increase in regular night flying.7. Summary.To sum up (i) under category (a) trans-ocean airports the capital cost falling on the Exchequer will, it is hoped,, be confined apart fromHeathrow to that involved in extending and equipping two orthree military airfields to the required civil standards. In anycase, their development will not involve costs comparable withHeathrow. The annual net cost of the maintenance of the airfieldswill depend on the volume of traffic and the amount of revenuewhich will be derived from landing and housing charges and other sources;(ii) the cost of providing airfields in categories (b) and (c) will fallmainly on local authorities;(iii) in the London area, the Exchequer may be required to bear the costof constructing and maintaining one or two airfields capable of handling continental and internal traffic in addition to, orsubstitution for, the State airfields which already exist.
