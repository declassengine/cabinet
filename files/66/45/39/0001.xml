THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERBM]secret.F, (44) 39 COPY NO.19th January, 19445WAR      CABINETBROADCASTINGNote by the Minister of InformationVfith reference to W,P,  (43) 580 it may be useful to my colleagues to read the comments I sent to the Deputy Prime Minister, and so, with, his agreement, a copy of my letter is circulated beGLovB. B.22nd December, 1943Here are the distilled thoughts of this Ministry concerning the draftPaper about broadcasting that you have in mind to circulate to the Cabinet,In the Paper I sent to the Reconstruction Committee I referred to aproposal that H.M,G. should appoint a small Committee to advise it on its attitude towards the future of radio broadcasting in this country.    In my view the time had now come for such a Committee to start work since, - althoughthe B.B.C,rs Charter does not expire until 1946, it seems to us impossible that with its increased importance internally and its developed world servicesit could ever return exactly to its pre-war position.   My feeling is that ifsuch a Committee were appointed- it ought itself to take into account theimportant point Avhich is raised in paragraph 2 of your draft, since theGovernment&apos;s future attitude towards the organisation of radio in this country must be considerably affected by the question whether commercial broadcastingon medium wave from stations adjacent to the United Kingdom is going to beallowed or can be controlled.The other subjects that your Paper draws attention to are of far reachingimportance, but seen to me of a different   order from the question of internalbroadcasting in this country,    I agree that it would be valuable to know what we ought to try to work for in these fields, while thinking.that it might bebetter if the two lines of inquiry were concluded separately and by differentpeople.Ministry of Information,19th January, 1944
