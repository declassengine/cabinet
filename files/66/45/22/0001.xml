THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 22.12th January, 1944.WAR CABINET.Copy No.   21SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR FORT-NIGHT ENDING 2nd JANUARY, 1944.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.Three heavy attacks were made on Berlin; Frankfurt was also raided inforce.Summary of Operations.Target.FrankfurtMannheim   ...Northern FranceBerlin ...BerlinBerlinBate.20/21 December20/2122/2323/2429/301/2AircraftDespatched.6505451378712421JanuaryIn addition, 165 aircraft were despatched on small harassing raids on german towns and targets in North France and 437 mines were laid.Operations.Frankfurt (20th/21st December).One of the largest loads ever despatched against a single target was directed against Frankfurt in this attack, while a complementary smaller raid wasmade on Mannheim to confuse the enemy defences. Bombing at first tended to be scattered, but as the attack proceeded, concentration improved and several large groups of fires were started. A number of heavy explosions were reported.Day photographs have not yet been obtained.Berlin [23rd/2Uh, 29th/30th December, 1943, 1st/2nd January, 1944).Preliminary reports indicate that the first of these attacks, carried out bya force of Lancasters on the 23rd/24th December, was successful. Accordingto enemy reports, the main weight of the attack fell on the east and south-eastparts of the city. The second attack on the 29th/30th December is believed to have been extremely successful. Fires and explosions were stated to be larger than usual. Day photographs have not yet been obtained but reports from neutral sources suggest that this was one of the most effective of recentattacks. Preliminary reports indicate that the first raid of the new year,carried out by Lancasters on the 1st/2nd January, was well concentrated, but no details are yet available.Results of Previous Raids.Berlin.Some photographs of Berlin were obtained on the 20th December, 1943, but owing to considerable cloud over the city, they only covered a strip running fromwest to east of the area south of Tiergarten. Complete cover was obtained onthe following day, but the photographs were less than half the usual size onaccount of the height from which they were taken.   It is apparent from these[26716] . b
pictures that a vast amount of damage has been done and a comprehensive statement will be, made when the, enlargements have , been examined in detail.The greatest devastation appears in the areas immediately north and south ofthe Tiergarten and almost on an equal scale in the adjacent districts ofSchoneberg, Wilmersdorf, Charlottenburg, Widding and the political and government&apos; offices and ministries surrounding the Unter den Linden andWilhelmstrasse.The full) built-up area in the centre of Berlin is one of the most densely populated in thy whole of Europe, housing about 200 people to the acre, whichis even more than the crowded districts of Bethnal Green or Shoreditch. Atleast 1,600 acres in this district have been devastated, which gives a figure of320,000 persons bombed out in this area alone. Estimates from ground sourcesvary from 800,000 upwards for the total number of Berliners bombed out andthere is no reason to suppose that these figures are any exaggeration.There are thousands of small factories throughout Berlin, the total outputof which is very large, and it is not difficult to believe the report of a neutralobserver that their output has decreased by 30-40 per cent, and that a largenumber of them can only function during hours of daylight owing to the failureof the electric light supply.The following extracts from a statement by a responsible and reliableinformant who was present in Berlin on the night of the 22nd November anduntil the end of the first week of December gives a fairly clear indication of thechaos in the city. (Since then some further 5,000 tons have been dropped on it) :  &quot; The most striking feature in the reactions of the population of Berlin tothe recent big R. A.F. raids is the passivity of the average German.The first impression given by people when they do come out of cellars afterraids are over is one of stunned stupefaction. The general feeling against theParty has been strongly accentuated by the recent raids and the way the party has carried out relief measures has caused considerable dissatisfaction. even this anti-Party sentiment nevertheless remains definitely passive.On no occasion during the recent air raids did source hear a singleexpression of hatred against the British. On the contraiy, the general attitudeof bombed people and people who have lost their relatives is to hold the NaziGovernment responsible for their loss. All these people who hate the Nazis are,however, completely cowed, and their only reaction is a kind of passive sabotage,which takes its expression in working as little as possible. There is no doubtwhatsoever that during the fourteen days after the raid of the 22nd Novemberproduction in the capital practically came to a standstill, and even now it is only at an absolute minimum.There may have been cases where attempts were made to put out fires duringthe raids themselves, but source himself saw no such cases. On the contrary, about one hour after the end of the first big alarm on the 22nd November another alarmwas sounded. No bombs or A/A fire was heard, but all fire-fighting work ceasedimmediately; people simply threw away their buckets and ran for shelter.There was an extraordinary lack of mutual co-operation. As soon as the raid was over, crowds of people appeared on the streets. They walked about gapingat the burning houses, and just moved on when they were called to participate inthe A.R.P. and fire-fighting work.On the morning of the 24th November the bombed parts of Berlin lookedabsolutely ghastly. This was practically the crucial moment of the week. there appeared to be no organised system of salvage work, and there were many instances where excavation operations on houses where cellars had been blockedwere suddenly broken off and the workmen moved off to other houses. The streetswere full of people searching for their relatives and friends.The civilian population did nothing to help in these salvage operationsthroughout the raids. The only people who worked really well were the troops,large numbers of whom were put in to work.Fire fighting after the raid of the 23rd/24th November - was even feebler thanthat;after the earlier attack. An A.B.P. warden said to source : &quot; What can onedo? Berliners won&apos;t do anything until their own fiat or house is in danger,, andafter it is burned they also wpn&apos;t do anything. Everyone thinks only of his personal-property.&quot; Naturally, there were instances where house fire brigadesfunctioned well, but as a whole they worked worse than could have been expected,and there was a complete lack of mutual support between the different houses.Looting became widespread after the raids, and from all sides source hasheard cases where people who carried their belongings from wrecked and burning
shouses found that all their goods had been stolen while they were inside the housesalvaging more belongings. There were also many cases of organised looting withthe help of lorries. Such lorries would pull up before places where furniture andother goods had been piled, and the drivers would state that they had been sent bythe municipal A.R.P. organisation to fetch the belongings. The owners of theproperty then loaded their goods inside the lorries and never saw them again.There are numerous posters on the walls giving particulars of people who havebeen executed for looting, and it is rumoured that the Gestapo has made many-arrests.&quot;Leipzig. .&quot; On the 5th December at midday it was still dark in Leipzig. The wholecity was covered by black smoke which stung and made it almost impossible tobreathe. A London fog was nothing compared with it.&quot; This description wasgiven to a Swiss newspaper by an actor who played in Leipzig on the night ofthis attack and survived to make his way to Switzerland. It was confirmed bythe evidence of the first photographs taken some ten hours after the attack, which showed very little else but rolling clouds of smoke, rising to thousands of feetabove the burning city, which it almost entirely covered.From these photographs it appeared that the main weight of the attack had fallen on the centre of the town, and this was confirmed by photographs takenby a second P.R. aircraft nearly three weeks later, which revealed the full extent and severity of tne damage, which runs in a wide strip right across the city from north to South, spreading out East and West from the centre of the city into themost densely built-up districts on either side.. Industrial damage, which is particularly severe, is concentrated chiefly inthe North, in and round the enormous railway yards spreading out from theMain Station, and in the South, where the huge buildings designed to house theLeipzig World Fair had been converted to the aircraft industry.North-East of the Station, between two radiating arms of the railwayyards, is a triangular area of some 120 acres, where a large number of factories are grouped together. This has been almost entirely obliterated. Eastwardsacross the railway yards is the third largest wool-combing works in Germany,the Leipziger Wollkammerei. which, like many other textile factories in Hanover,Munchen Gladbach and elsewhere, has been severely damaged.The majority of Leipzig&apos;s damaged factories, however, are concerned with various kinds of engineering. The,most important is the factory set up in theWorld&apos;s Fair Buddings to the South-East of the town, which was engaged onthe repair of Junkers aero-engines, and probably also on the sub-assembly ofJunkers fuselages. The largest of these buildings boasted 170,000 square feet olfloor space and an &quot; unsupported roof &quot; of 321-feet span. This roof at presentoccupies most of the floor space.Leipzig&apos;s position gives it obvious importance as a railway centre. damage to transportation is considerable, but not on the scale suggested by groundreports which spoke of complete chaos in the railway system following thedestruction of the Main Station. This is definitely not destroyed, though itsroof-lights have been shattered, and railway damage seems to be confined to three minor stations and a great number of storage buildings and warehousesin the yards.Immediately South-West of the Main Station is the old town, the centre ofLeipzig&apos;s civic life, crowded with offices, restaurants, public buildings andtheatres. Most of this area, including the main shopping street, which runsacross the centre of it, is now laid waste, and even the wide surrounding beltof tree-lined boulevards has not availed to check the spread of the fires whichhave eaten deeply into the densely populated tenement areas on either side, andeven further in a southward direction.\ Prints Nos 1-3 show some of the damage.The population density in the fully built-up zone of Leipzig is between150 and 170 to the acre, and at least 375 acres in these zones have been devastated.The concentration of the damage round the centre of the town means that theless densely populated areas further out have suffered lightly with about 45 acres of devastation. In all, it may be estimated that some 65,000 people will havebeen added to the growing list of bombed-out persons.,    A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, 12th January, 1944.[26716]
