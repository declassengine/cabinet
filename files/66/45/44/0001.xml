f&apos;0 CO   y195(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY5S GOVERNMENT)REGRETW.P.(44) 44.22ND JANUARY,  1944.WAR CABINETEMPLOYMENT OP PRISONERS OP WAR IN 1944COPY NO,Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries.     I desire to bring to the notice of my colleagues thepossible consequences to the agricultural production programmeif the supply of labour in agriculture is limited as at presentseems probable.      In September 1945 my Department submittedestimates of the additional labour which would be required tomake good wastage and to -provide for an expanded agricultural programme, and after revision these figures totalled 69,400, ofwhich it &quot;was suggested 46,400 should be women Tor the Women&apos;s land Army, 20,000 net prisoners of war (25,000 gross owing to employment on camp duties, etc.)  and 5,000 workers from Eire.2*These additional labour requirements were needed -(a) for the cultivation of an extra 700,000 acres of arable land, including art increase in the acreage of potatoes!(b) to provide for additional land reclamation and drainageby gang labour which could be used at times of seasonalpressure for certain agricultural operations such asthreshing, root hoeing, ctcr.; -(c) to provide additional milkers to relieve the burden onthe dairy industry from which milkers are drifting awayowing to the necessity of working long hours and a 7-day week;(d) to make good the normal wastage through the call-up of young men for the Forces;(e)to make good the labour deficiency in 1943 which had beencausing workers in agriculture to carry on excessiveburden which they might not be able to continue to bear.3.     The question of allocation of new manpower, other thanprisoners&quot;of war, was remitted to the Ministerial Committee on manpower -and I have been advised by the Chancellor of the exchequer that that Committee is unlikely to find itself able to allocatemore than 5,000 women in 1944 out of 46,400 for which I had asked.I understand that they consider that this small allocation shouldbe taken into account in allocating prisoners of war to agriculture,the deficiency canthp.s be made good,brought in in 194432*500*ofbut it is hopeless to expect that the whole the total number of prisoners expected to be is unlikely to exceed 73,000 and may not exceed

4* The Allocation Committee of officials had provisionallyagreed that the- Agricultural Departments (including Scotland)should receive 0,600 out of the first 32,500 -prisoners (whichwill arrive from February&apos; to May inclusive)  and a total of19,750 if the total inflow of prisoners reaches 73,000,This allocation was made before the Chancellor of the exchequer had made known to me the contemplated allocation of women for19446     Even if the total allocation of prisoners to agriculturereaches 19,750 the English share will be something less than this, and as the figure is gross it is probable that the netsupply of prisoners for agriculture in England and Wales willnot appreciably exceed 18,000.5. In that event the additional labour force for agriculture in England and Wales would amount to only about20,000, in place of the 69,400 which had been estimated as our requirements*     With so small an allocation I should not feel justified in . asking Count;.&quot; War Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees and farmers to embark upon the expanded agricultural programme that We had intended.6* I have, been in communication with the Chancellor of theExchequer and informed him that I should feel justified in attempting to carry out our programme - though at serious riskof failure in some respects - if the total labour made availableto agriculture in England and Wales, in addition to Irish workers,could be assured at at least 35,000 women or prisoners of war,together with such further prisoners as would be required forcamp duties, etc.      If the Women&apos;s Land Array allocation is tobe limited to 5,000 in excess of last year?s ceiling this wouldmean an allocation of prisoners to agriculture in England andWales of at least 36,000^1P The memorandum by the Lord President of the Council(W. P.(44)36)  suggests that the inflow of prisoners &quot;should be regulated by the vacant accomodation already available in camps,hostelss etc. and that distribution among various departments should be regulated by the accomodation at their disposalsWe have not at present accommodation in agricultural camps andhostels for more than about 15*000 prisoners, although by the endof September, owing to the transfer to farm billets, we mightbe able to accommodate nearly 20,000a.      I submit, however, thatin view of the acute manpower shortage it is hardly reasonableeither to restrict the &quot;inflow of prisoners or to determine thework upon which they shall be engaged by the availability ofvacant accommodation,,     I suggest, therefore, that if myoolleagues agree to the allocation of 36,000 prisoners for agriculture in England and Wales they should be housed in existing accommodation to the extent that this is available inlocalities where the prisoners are required, but that new building should be authorised to the extent that may be necessaryto house prisoners in localities where the need for them isgreatest,,     I do not expect that the amount of new building.would be very large.8B Should the War Cabinet feel unable to agree to my proposals, I can see no alternative to a downward, revision inour cropping programme and food target for 1944.     The mostserious consequences would perhaps be on the milk supply and onthe acreage of potatoes, both of which present special difficultiesin connection with labour.     There would also, however, beadverse effects upon land drainage and reclamation and upon theproduction of arable crops other than potatoes. &apos;(Intld.)
