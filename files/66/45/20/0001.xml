84THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENTSECRET 1 .W.P.(44) ap WAR CABINET10 th January 1944 INDIA Copy No..BENGAL SITUATION.Memorandurn by the secretary of state, for IndiaIf the War Cabinet approve the viceroy&apos;s proposal forthe.suspension of the Ministry in Bengal (W.P.(44.) 18) it willbe necessary to issue at the appropriate moment a statementof tho reasons for this step.   I therefore append for consid-eration in conjunction with that paper a draft of such astatement prepared after consultation with the Viceroy.L.S.A.10th January 1944.DRAFT statement the Governor of Bengal, with the concurrence of theGovernor-Ceneralj has decided that in the existing circum-stances the Government of the Province cannot be carried onin accordance with the provisions of the Government of india act, 1935; and he is issuing a proclamation under section 93by which he is assuming the powers vested in the ministry and Legislature.   The Governor is convinced that thesituation-Is now such as-cannot be met by MinisterialGovernment; and that the controversies and&apos;delays which are,in the present&apos;circumstances of Bengal, inevitable&apos;with a -political Ministry, must be superseded by a directadministration.   The arrangements.for receiving^ accounting for, and staring food-grains imported into the&quot;province havefallen short of what the situation required;, measures forenforcement of the food grains control order and apprehensionand punishment of offenders against it have been&quot;deficient;there has been three months1 delay in carrying out the rationing scheme for Calcutta; there is no satisfactoryassurance that the distribution of the aman harvest, onwhich the safety of Bengal iramediatelyr&quot;depends, will be effectively achieved; or that organisation of medicalrelief will ensure that the spread of disease among an under-nourished population will be prevented.   Experience hasshown that under present exceptional conditions a ministry is incapable of enforcing the measures which must be carried through at once if a disaster comparable with that of lastyear is to be avoided. : -Failure in any or all of these respects, apart from thesuffering that would thereby be caused to the people of bengal, would gravely prejudice the conduct of operations against Japanese in regard to which Bengal is in the frontline.   The operations of the South-East Asia command, inwhich iiftierican aid is intimately involved and which&apos; are ofthe highest importance to the united Nations, must not be hampered by inadequate administration.   The Governor cannot,with due regard to his responsibilities, acquiesce in a situation which not only gravely hampers the recovery of the
province from the late disaster, but threatens a further period of economic trouble which would again impose a heavy strain on, other parts of India and on sources of supplyoutride India which are themselves likely to. be severelytaxed in meeting the requirements of India as a whole andof the other united nations and may prove an impediment tothe most effective prosecution of the war.
