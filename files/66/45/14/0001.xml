THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.Copy No.WAR CABINET.THE PROTECTION OF MONUMENTS AND WORKS OF ART.Note by the Deputy Prime Minister.I feel bound to bring to the attention of my colleagues the annexedmemorandum which has been submitted by the Chairman of the StandingCommittee of the Trustees of the British Museum. It will be observed that it isalso signed by the Principal Trustees of the Museum, the Chairman of the trustees of the National Gallery and the Chairman of the Advisory Council of the victoria and Albert Museum.2. In this connection my colleagues may like to be informed that on the12th November, 1943, I was approached by a group of Members of Parliamentheaded by Mr. E. H. Keeling, M.P., who expressed similar views to those set outin the memorandum, and in particular made the following three points (a) steps should be taken to ensure that no unnecessary damage is done tohistoric monuments and works of art during the course of operations;(&amp;) adequate measures should be taken to prevent vandalism and lootingduring the period of occupation;(c) a record should be kept of the works of art looted or destroyed by the.enemy with a view to their subsequent return or replacement.C, R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,7th January, 1944.ANNEX.The grave peril to which cultural monuments, public museums, libraries, and works of art in ecclesiastical and private hands on the Continent are exposedby the incidence of the War is a matter of deep concern.Modern methods of war can in a few weeks deprive posterity of its inheri-tance of three thousand years of civilisation.The problem is admittedly one of great difficulty. It can be consideredbriefly under the following headings : 1. Salvage, preservation and stock-taking behind the battle front.It is understood that steps have already been taken and a department set upby the War Office, with Sir Leonard Woolley in charge at home and officersworking abroad in conjunction with A.M.G. But we feel that, in view of thegreat issues at stake, such work should form part of a larger scheme, and not be confined to a subordinate part of one branch of the service.2. Minimising War Damage.To avoid altogether the risks of bombardment by air, land or sea is recognised as impossible. But the dangers arising from ignorance can be met by making available to the fighting services the large amount of specialised knowledge in thiscountry.[26695]SECRET.W.P. (44) 14.7th January,&quot; 1944.
A very brief list giving (a) Places of first-class importance to be avoided, where possible,(6) Places which may be attacked in such a way as to minimise the danger to certain objects,has already been submitted to Bomber Command, North Africa, and wascourteously received. Similar lists should be prepared for other areas and kept up to date.3. Post War Problems.The end of the war will be followed by a vast redistribution of works of artthroughout the European Continent and possibly the Far East as well. Thequestion of compensation and restoration of looted or destroyed property will beof the greatest complexity. Priorities for restoration of buildings will be dis-puted. Some authoritative body will have to be set up to deal specially with this aspect of post-war settlement.The President of the United States has appointed a special Commission,presided over by a High Court Judge and comprising eminent authorities, to dealwith the problem in all aspects. There is good reason to believe that theAmerican Commission will welcome British co-operation on the same lines, andin fact expects it.We strongly urge that a similar Commission should be set up in this country.No existing body such as the Royal Fine Arts Commission or the standing commission on Museums and Galleries has either the appropriate powers orconstitution to enable it to undertake this work. The field is vast, far beyond thescope of a subordinate department or any one of the fighting services.Such a Commission would be able to give the best advice, to supplyspecialised information, or recommend experts. It could co-ordinate the efforts of individual bodies and persons. The need for such a body is already urgent,and if the need is not met now, an improvisation may have to be devised, withresults which may not be creditable to this country.Meanwhile it is urgently necessary to hasten and enlarge the organisation ofprotective measures at the battle-fronts. No preparation whatever had been madefor the performance of these duties in Africa, and recent reports indicate that action subsequently initiated in London is not yet effective in Italy. Much loss and damage which could have been avoided have already occurred there. Wetherefore urge, in addition to a Special Commission, the immediate appointmentin the battle areas of officers with sufficient knowledge and authority to supplyexpert information and assistance to the Sea, Land, and Air Forces before andafter offensive operations.(Signed) WILLIAM CANTUAR,SIMON,D. CLIFTON BROWN,Principal Trustees of the British Museum.(Signed) LANG OF LAMBETH, Archbishop,Chairman of the Standing Committee ofthe Trustees of the British Museum.(Signed) VINCENT MASSEY,Chairman of the Trustees of the national gallery.(Signed) HAREWOOD,Chairman of the Advisory Council of the victoria and Albert Museums.\Uh December, 1943.
