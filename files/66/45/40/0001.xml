(44) 15)20th January, 1944WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 229)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 13th January, to0700 20th January,1944[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.I. Allied destroyers and small craft have been active in the Adriatic.Two U-boats have been sunk and two possibly sunk.Home Waters.2. Early on the morning of the 17th E-boats in three groups attempted toattack a coastal convoy off the Lizard, but were driven off by the escortingdestroyers Talybont and Brissenden. The convoy was undamaged. Talybontdamaged one E-boat. Enemy coastal batteries on the same day shelled MLs.minelaying off Calais.During the night of the 19th/20th the German s.s. Miinsterland (6,408 tons)sailed from Boulogne in convoy and attempted to pass through the Dover Strait,where she was engaged and sunk by our coastal batteries. The rest of the convoysplit up and entered Calais. Previously a blockade runner, this ship sailed fromBordeaux homeward-bound on the 8th October. She was frequently attacked by aircraft, and after calling at Brest was in dry dock at Cherbourg from the27th October to the 22nd December. She reached Dieppe on the 30th, and was again attacked by aircraft at Boulogne on the 1st January.Mediterranean.3. H.M. destroyers and light craft have carried out patrols and bombard-ments off the Dalmatian coast. On the night of the 12th/13th L.C.Gs., withM.T.Bs. in support, shelled Split. On the following night M.T.Bs. torpedoed asmall cargo ship in Sumartin Harbour (Brae Island, off Split) and engaged aSiebel ferry : H.M. destroyers on successive nights shelled Rovigno (north ofPola), Durazzo, Drvenik and Vela Luka (Korcula Island).4. Coastal forces operating from Bastia on the night of the 17th/18thshelled and damaged a number of lighters off Spezia.5. H.M. S/M Untiring on the 6th sank an F-lighter in the Gulf of Genoa.Levant.6. On the night of the 10th/11th our coastal forces, entering Livadia Bay,Piskopi Island (north-west of Rhodes), badly damaged a cargo ship and a tanker, one of which sank. On the night of the 12th/.13th M.T.Bs. sank aschooner at Piskopi.7. H.M. S/M Sibyl on the 8th sank a schooner and on the following day acaique, both by gunfire off Mitylene. The Polish S/M Dzik between the 7th and sank a 6.000-ton ship, a schooner, and a caique, all in the iEgean.Black Sea.8. Between the 22nd December and the 6th January Russian submarines in the Black Sea sank two 4,000-ton ships and two minesweepers, and probablyanother cargo ship. Aircraft claim one U-boat, one 3,000-ton cargo ship andtwo lighters. Shore batteries overlooking the Dnieper estuary bombarded enemysmall craft which attempted to leave Nikolaev before the ice froze hard; theyclaim a tug, a barge, and a motor-launch sunk and six lighters damaged.East Indies.9. The Japanese cruiser torpedoed and sunk by H.M. S/M Tally-Ho offPenang on the 11th is now known to have been of the Kuma class (5-5&quot;, built1919). Tally-Ho also sank a 6,000-ton ship south of the Andaman Islands four days later.Pacific.10. In the Central Pacific the Japanese main fleet has continued inactive.New Guinea.II. During the night of the 16th/7th two Allied destroyers bombardedJapanese positions on Gali Point (south-east of Saidor), starting a large explosionand fires. There has been intense activity against barge traffic, and U.S.destroyers have shelled enemy supply dumps between Saidor and Sio.  Attempts
are probably being made to withdraw Japanese troops from their dangerous situation in this area. On the night of the 10th/11th U.S. M.T.Bs. sank threenorthbound barges, each containing some 30 Japanese, west of Sio, and laterdestroyed two barges being loaded at Sio.Solomons.12. U.S. destroyers on the 13th bombarded the Tinputz-Ruri Bay area in north-East Bougainville Island.   Fires were started in the camp area.Anti-Submarine Operations.13. Twenty-one attacks on U-boats have been reported, fourteen of whichwere by ships, five by shore-based aircraft, and two by carrier-borne aircraft.On the 13th a U-boat was sunk by a Wellington west of Cape Finisterre;43 survivors were rescued by the U.S.S. Block Island (escort carrier) on thefollowing day. Aircraft from the U.S.S. Guadalcanal (escort carrier) sank oneU-boat and possibly a second on the 16th east of the Azores; some 20 of the crew were seen in the water. On the same day a U-boat was possibly sunk north ofthe Azores by H.M.S. Bligh (frigate), one of the escorts of a homeward-bound convoy.Enemy Intelligence.14. &quot;The Tivpitz. it is now reported, was more severely damaged byH.M. midget submarines than was at first supposed, and it is believed that thetemporary repairs now in progress in Altenf jord will take at least one or two more months.German propaganda has emphasized their fear of an Allied invasion ofJutland, and the east and west coast defences have been strengthened. Sonder-borg, a small port at the northern end of Kiel Bay, has been developed as a naval base and a centre for U-boat experiments. During the past three months veryconsiderable additions have been made to the personnel and to the defences of theport.Photographic reconnaissance of Trieste on the 15th showed that an uncom-pleted cruiser (510 feet long) had been either sunk or scuttled; that at Speziaon the 16th extensive mining was being carried out in the dockyard area; andthat at Leghorn demolition of the quays continued.The Germans are making every effort to increase their shipping of supplies tothe JEgean from the Black Sea.U-boats.15. The whole operational force of Atlantic U-boats is concentrated in theeastern portion of the North-Western Approaches. It is believed that there arenow no U-boats in the South Atlantic, off West Africa, in the Caribbean, or offthe U.S. seaboard.Enemy Attack on Shipping.16. During the week one ship (s.s. Perseus, 10,286 tons) was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat, probably Japanese, off Pondicherry.  All the crew were saved.Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. During the week ending the 16th, 774 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 190 ships were in ocean convoys and 584 in British coastal convoys. One escort carrier, 59 destroyers, and 126 sloops, cutters, frigates, and corvettes (including 18 U.S. ships) were employed on escort duties.Two homeward-bound ocean convoys, consisting of 64 ships, and tw&apos;o outward-bound convoys, of 126 ships, arrived at their destinations without loss.Heavy weather in the North-Western Approaches has caused casualties among ships in convoy.Allied Minelaying.18.   Aircraft laid mines off the Frisian Islands and off the Biscay ports.In the ^aegean aircraft laid mines off the Dodecanese and Cyclades Islands.Mines were also laid in Burmese rivers.[26757] b
Enemy Minelaying, British Mines weeping.19. There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy aircraft or surface craft during the week.Three moored mines and two ground mines have been destroyed in home waters, including one ground mine off Portsmouth.The mine totals are : 4,619 ground, 3,961 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.20. The German s.s. Rastenburg (ex-Greek Leontios Teryazos, 4,479 tons),previously reported as s.s. Cast em-brut, left Bilbao with iron ore on the 15th.Five of the larger ships engaged in this traffic have also been reported duringthe week between Bayonne and Bilbao.On the 16th the German s.s. Peter Hoos (ex-French P.L.M. 16, 3,754 tons)arrived at Istanbul with a cargo of coal and an M.L. on board, bound for thePirseus. The motor barge Seerose, which in December carried 1,300 tons ofchrome from Istanbul to Bourgas, recently passed through the Dardanelles to salonika laden with coal.Four small craft have been assembled at Salonika from parts which arrivedby rail.Norwegian Intelligence.21. The Fredrikstad shipyard in Norway (south of Oslo) is being extended and modernised, including the enlargement of one of its three slipways to650 feet. It is estimated that one cargo ship per month will be built there.The yard is at present engaged on repairs to German vessels and the building oftwo 7,000-ton tankers for the German navy.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.22. Since the 14th a new Russian offensive has been in progress west ofLeningrad and north of Lake Ilmen. Although the Russians report that theyhave captured Peterhof, Ropsha and Krasnoe-Selo, south-west of Leningrad,and have broken through strong fortifications, it is not yet known how muchground has been gained. The Germans admit the evacuation of Novgorod.North-west of Velikie Luki, however, where the Russians have also been attackingin some strength, a 10-15 miles advance has been made and the railwayLeningrad-Nevel has been cut. North-west of Nevel, too, there has been some further gain of ground but at Vitebsk the Russian attacks have slackened off,apparently without having made any further advance towards the city.Central Sector.23. On the 11th yet another offensive was launched, this time north andsouth of Mozyr. driving into the Pripet Marshes. Mozyr itself was capturedon the 14th after good progress had been made on both sides of the town. Tothe north, the Russians have now reached a point 30 miles due south of Bobruisk;to the south, they have pushed into the south-east corner of the Pripet Marshesbut the situation is obscure here and it is not quite clear how the front runs atpresent.Kiev Sector.24.   The Russians have made progress :  (a) Beyond and south of Sarny, which was captured on the 12th.   They havenow reached a point 15 miles east-north-east of Rovno.(b) Towards Shepetovka and west of Berdichev.(c) East of Vinnitsa, where advanced elements approached the railway ofVinnitsa-Zhmerinka.(d) Towards Uman, having cut the railway to Smela. ,   :Since the 12th, the Germans have been counter-attacking strongly at three points : west of Berdichev, east of Vinnitsa, north of Uman. As these counter-attacks have been both persistent and heavy, there is probably some truth in the
German claim that they regained some ground. In general, however, the Russiansappear to be holding their own, and they have certainly not been driven backvery far.Dnieper Bend.25. On the 10th the Russians, advancing astride the railway Znamenka-Smela, reached a point 14 miles from the latter town. The Germans have on several occasions reported unsuccessful Russian attacks against the Nikopolbridgehead.Crimea.26. Since the 11th the Russians have been attacking from their bridgeheadnorth-east of Kerch, but there has been little change of position.General.27. The Russians have launched two new offensives, at Leningrad and towards the Pripet Marshes, the second of which has already made substantial progress. They have made further progress on a wide front in the Kiev bulgeand they are stubbornly resisting attempts to drive back their spearheads fromthe vital German communications.The fact that the Germans are still fighting hard and holding on atBoguslav, Smela, Krivoi Rog and the Nikopol bridgehead suggests that they havenot yet decided to evacuate the Dnieper bend. Similarly, there are no signs as yet that they intend to evacuate the Crimea, where they are still offering a determined resistance to the Russian attempts to extend the Kerch bridgehead.Italy.28. On the Eighth Army front the Canadians launched an attack on the17th with limited objectives from their forward positions along a gully two miles north-west of Ortona. This attack achieved some initial success, but by the evening of the 18th, following heavy German counter-attacks, our troops, with-drew to their original positions. Elsewhere on the Eighth Army front there hasbeen a certain regrouping of our forces and some long-range&apos;patrol activity tothe west of Casoli.  Snow has again fallen in the mountains.The French attack on the enemy&apos;s mountain positions facing the right flank of the Fifth Army has made very satisfactory progress, and has resulted inan advance of some four miles along a nine-mile front. By the 18th theFrench had captured the village of S. Elia and were in contact with theGermans&apos; defence line along the upper reaches of the river Rapido. further south U.S. troops made equally good progress and captured Cervaro on the 14th.Enemy resistance was particularly fierce in this area, and several counter-attacks were launched in an attempt to restore the position, but without avail.South of the main Cassino road U.S. troops captured Mt. Trocchio on the 15th,and subsequently advanced to the river Rapido at a point three miles south ofCassino. During the 18th and 19th both the French and U.S. troops consolidatedtheir newly won positions and maintained patrol activity.On the night of the 17th/18th, British infantry launched an attack from their positions on the Garigliano along a front stretching from the mouth of the riverto a point about nine miles upstream. The assault was immediately successful,although, after the enemy had recovered from his initial surprise, he put downheavy mortar and machine-gun fire. After two days&apos; hard fighting, during whichthe enemy counter-attacked several times with tanks in support, our troops had secured a firm bridgehead some two miles in depth. On their right flank they had advanced up to and beyond Castelforte, while on the coast they had captured theArgento feature and were pressing on beyond Minturno.Yugoslavia.29. The German offensive in central Bosnia has had considerable success.South of Banjaluka the German columns that captured Jajce and Mrkonicgradon the 8th have pushed on south-east, in face of strong resistance, to Glamoc(half-way between Banjaluka and Split), where fierce fighting was in progress onthe 18th.Twenty-five miles east of Banjaluka the Germans have captured Prnjauor.In Dalmatia, German forces succeeded in occupying the whole island of Braeby the middle of the month.[26757] &apos; ,,; vm ... - n 2
Greece.30. The Germans have left the mountains of north-west Peloponnese, andthe road between Patras and Kalavrita (in the mountains 25 miles south-east)is no longer under their control. In Southern Peioponnese, a German expeditionto capture the local mission H.Q. was successfully attacked by E.L.A.S. onthe 10th.Zervas reports that after two days&apos; fighting against a German force he wasobliged on the 12th to retire eastwards from the heights north of Arta.Burma.31. Our troops captured Maungdaw on the 10th after several days of steadyfighting, and have now reached positions three miles south of the town. TheJapanese have made a number of small and unsuccessful counter-attacks on ouradvancing troops.New Guinea.32. U.S. forces at Saidor have consolidated a defensive position and arepatrolling actively over a radius of about ten miles. The Australian forcesadvancing from Finsehhafen entered Sio (about 50 miles east of Saidor) on the14th, encountering little opposition. Sio was formerly of some importance asa Japanese barge staging point.New Britain.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)33. Marines have made further advances southwards in the Borgen Bayarea (8 miles south-east of Cape Gloucester) against stiffening Japaneseopposition. Japanese casualties now total over 3,000 since the original landing,whereas U.S. casualties are comparatively light. In other sectors there is nothing to report.The Japanese are reported to be evacuating Rooke Umboi Island (15 miles west of Cape&apos; Gloucester and 30 miles east of Saidor), where they formerlymaintained a garrison of about 500.Solomons.34. Bougainville: U.S. troops made a small landing on the 8th near CapeMoltke, about 25 miles north-west of Cape Torokina. On the following day the landing party was joined by a further party who had advanced overland withoutencountering resistance.Choiseul. -The remaining Japanese garrison on Choiseul is reported to bein a starving condition and to be awaiting evacuation by submarine.AIR SITUATION.General Review.35.   Aircraft of Bomber Command made a heavy attack on Brunswick.In Italy, enemy railway centres were bombed; close support was providedfor our land forces.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping off the Dalmatian coast and in the ^gean Sea.Shipping in Rabaul harbour (New Britain) was effectively bombed.United Kingdom.36. In daylight no enemy aircraft were reported overland; one Ju. 88 was shot down north of the Shetlands.Three raids involving a total of 18 enemy aircraft were carried out at night;some scattered bombing took place over South-East England. One enemy aircraft was shot down by a Mosquito and another by A.A. guns.Home Waters.37. On the 14th, Beaufighters, of which three are missing, made threeattacks on convoys off the Norwegian coast; one 4,000-ton ship was torpedoed,another of 5,000 tons was probably torpedoed and six escort vessels were damaged by cannon fire.aircraft t of Bomber Command laid 66 sea-mines in enemy waters.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.38. Bad weather severely restricted offensive operations and only on one day of the week, the 14th, were large-scale attacks possible. On this day, military objectives in Northern France were attacked by 916 aircraft which dropped1,779 tons of bombs and fired 174 rocket projectiles; the attacking aircraftincluded 509 Fortresses and Liberators. Enemy casualties, by the bombers andby the 78 squadrons of fighters which co-operated, were 28 destroyed, five probably destroyed and 21 damaged for the loss of 16 Allied aircraft.On the 13th, ten Typhoons, patrolling airfields in Northern France, destroyedeight enemy aircraft for the loss of one Typhoon.Night.39. Bomber Command operated in strength on the night of the 14th/15thwhen 434 heavy bombers, out of&apos; 498 despatched, dropped 2,005 tons on Brunswick.Cloud over the target prevented the majority of marker bombs from being seen and most crews bombed on sky-marker flares. No satisfactory concentration wouldappear to have been achieved. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed on this operation from which 38 Lancasters are missing. On the same night, Mosquitoesmade diversionary attacks on Magdeburg and Berlin, and 77 bombers dropped360 tons, in good visibility, on military objectives in Northern France.On the night of the 13th/14th, light scale raids by Mosquitoes were made onEssen, Duisburg, Aachen and Koblenz; one Mosquito is missing.Italy.40. A heavy scale of attack was maintained against enemy railway centres and lines of communication by Allied bombers.Targets in the Florence area were the particular objectives of Fortressesand, Liberators, and included Prato, Arezzo, Certaldo, Poggibonsi, Pontassieve,Pistola and Pisa; in most instances a good concentration of bombing was obtained and considerable destruction caused. Orte and term  were each attacked on three occasions by a total of 176 and 198 medium bombers respectively; a numberof hits were obtained on the railway bridges and many bombs burst in the railwayyards. Bridges were also hit at Orvieto, Guilianova (25 miles north-north-west ofPescara) and Montaldo di Castro (26 miles south-west of Viterbo), and the bridgeapproach was seriously damaged at San Giovanni (4 miles north-west of Foligno).An excellent concentration of bombs was obtained on the railway yards at Foligno;the railway line to Spoleto and 15 tracks in the sidings were cut, six sheds, stationbuildings and the power sub-station were hit and the. Aeronautica Umbraairframe factory was half wrecked. Other railway centres bombed were Civita-vecchia, Civitanova, Chiaravalle (9 miles west-south-west of Ancona), Viterbo andPiombino (32 miles north-west of Grosseto). Successful attacks were made onlanding grounds at Guidonia (Rome), Osoppo (15 miles north-west of Udine) andVillorba (15 miles north-north-east of Venice).Light bombers, fighter-bombers and fighters were very active in the battle area. Communications and targets in the rear of the enemy positions weresubjected to constant attacks and full tactical support was afforded to Alliedland forces. A successful attack was carried out on a tank repair shop at Loreto(12 miles west-south-west of Pescara) which was almost completely demolished.In the course of operations over Italy Allied and enemy losses were each28 aircraft.Yugoslavia.41. On the 14th, the airfield and town of Mostar were attacked by68 Liberators and later by 140 Fortresses with fighter escort. At least 13 air-craft on the ground were destroyed and six others probably damaged, sevenhangars or other large buildings were hit and the contents of three destroyed.In combat three enemy aircraft were shot down and one Allied bomber and twofighters are missing. A successful attack was made on Zara by 24 Liberatorsresulting in the post office being gutted, a direct hit on the customs house andscattered damage on the water-front.
Fighter-bombers flew 265 sorties against shipping and other targets on the dalmatian Coast with the following good results :  Sibenik.Medium-sized motor ship, set on fire. Ship, set on fire. Ship, direct hits. Ship 5,000 tons, left burning. Ship 5,000 tons, hit -seen listing. Cargovessel, set on fire. Ship 300 feet, set on fire. Ship 3/4,000 tons, two hits.Ship 5,000 tons, fire in stern. Ship 600 feet, blew up in harbour. Ship300 feet, hits. Motor-launch, hit. Two barges, hit one on fire. M.T.B.,hit.Ploca.Motor vessel, 600 feet, hits.   Small schooner, set on fire.South of Split.Two small motor vessels and Siebel ferry, damaged.Greece and JEgean Sea.42. A night attack on Piraeus Harbour was carried out by 21 Wellingtonsand 14 heavy bombers. Warehouses and buildings on the Tzelepi Mole weredevastated, many small vessels were sunk, and industrial plants and office&apos;buildings were destroyed. Salonika railway yards were bombed by 23Wellingtons and bursts were seen on the target.Sea-mining operations were carried out by ten Wellingtons. successful attacks were made against shipping attempting to supply the enemy-occupiedislands in the -aegean Area; 26 caiques (between 50-200 tons), two trawlers,one R-boat and one small vessel were sunk or damaged.South Austria. *43. The Messerschmitt aircraft factory at Klagenfurt was attacked by67 Fortresses escorted by fighters. Numerous direct hits were obtained on the target and a very large explosion was seen in the railway centre. Approximately20 enemy aircraft intercepted our bombers, three of which were shot down and four Allied fighters are missing.Russia.44. The only reports available show that the Russian Air Force was actively engaged in close-support of operations in the areas of Novosokolniki (15 miles west of Velikie Luki) and Mozyr, where new offensives were launched by theRussians.At the end of the week, in the region of Novosokolniki, German positions and lines of communication were attacked and a railway station raided, as aresult of which a number of trains are stated to have been destroyed.On the 15th January, operations of a similar nature were carried out nearKalinkovichi, a railway station seven miles north-north-east of Mozyr, when atrain was claimed to have been blown up.Apart from an improvement in the weather at the beginning of the week insome sectors, adverse flying conditions prevailed over the front as a whole.In spite of this, however, there are indications that in all fighting areas, theRussian Air Force continued to give valuable support to ground forces so faras weather permitted.There are several indications that G.A.F. strength on the Southern Front isin no way sufficient to permit effective intervention at any one point. TheRussian advance into Poland appears to have encountered little air opposition.Burma.45. In the North, a total of 124 light and fighter bombers attacked enemy positions, bridges, M.T. and other targets mostly in the Mogaung and Shaduzupareas and, in the Upper Chindwin, similar objectives were raided on 13 occasionsby a total of 137 fighters. The airfield at Myitkyina was bombed by 48 Mustangs,and stores dumps near Yuwa, in the Upper Chindwin, were attacked by28 Liberators and Mitchells.
In Central Burma, Beaufighters attacked and hit six factories in theMonywa/Sagaing area, and damaged three river bridges about 60 miles east ofKatha.In the Arakan district, Vengeances and Hurricanes, of which about 240operated, attacked enemy positions around Maungdaw and Buthidaung.In the South, night attacks were made by Wellingtons on Pyinmana(150 miles south of Mandalay), Bassein and two airfields near Rangoon.Liberators bombed railway targets at Rangoon and Malagon (5 miles north ofRangoon).Attacks on enemy communications resulted in damage to, or destruction of,an oil tanker, two oil barges, four small steamers and 124 sampans and river-craft. In addition, four locomotives, 21 M.T. and 76 units of rolling-stock were also damaged.On the 15th, about 40 enemy fighters operated in three waves over BawliBazar (73 miles north-north-west of Akyab). Interception by Spitfires resultedin the destruction of 15 enemy aircraft and damage to others for the loss of oneSpitfire.Siam.46. On the night of the 12th/13th, 14 Liberators bombed the railway yards at Bangkok.China Area.47. In attacks on shipping off the China and Indo-China coasts, two small ships were sunk and four ships and a gunboat were damaged.The harbour at Takao (Formosa) was attacked by nine Liberators, and28 Mitchells bombed buildings on Nanpang Island (100 miles west-south-west of Hong Kong).Pacific Zone.New Guinea.48. A total of 91 escorted Liberators bombed A.A. positions at Hansa bay and at the nearby airfield at Nubia.Gun positions, barges, villages and other targets in the coastal areas aroundUligan Bay, Alexishafen, Madang and Bogadyim were attacked on 30 occasionsby a total of 520 aircraft. Apart from ten enemy aircraft damaged onAlexishafen airfield, no definite results are reported.An M.T. dispersal area near Dumpu (75 miles north-west of Lae) was bombed by 46 escorted Mitchells and, subsequent to a bombardment of enemy positions on Gali Point by Allied destroyers (see Naval Situation), nine Mitchellsattacked the target.About 35 enemy aircraft ineffectively attacked Saidor and were intercepted by Kittyhawks which destroyed 19 of them. A further eight enemy aircraft were destroyed over Wewak by Lightnings, of which three are missing.New Britain.49. Two effective attacks, by a total of 94 escorted light bombers, were madeon enemy shipping in Rabaul harbour; four cargo ships were sunk, a fifth was lefton fire and 17 others were damaged, and it is probable that a destroyer and alight cruiser were also damaged. In addition, eight attacks were made on airfields in the Rabaul area by a total of 118 heavy and medium bombers. In allthese operations, 59 enemy aircraft were destroyed and a further 34 were probably destroyed; five Allied bombers and 18 fighters are missing.Heavy, medium and light bombers were also engaged in giving support to allied land forces in the Borgen Bay and Arawe areas.Night attacks on shipping by Liberators resulted in the probable sinking of a ship off Rabaul.New Ireland.50. On the night of the 15th/16th, Catalinas attacked a convoy of 11 ships off the north-west coast; one ship was sunk and two others were left on fire.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.54. On the night of the 13th/14th minor bombing occurred at Sevenoaksand Uckfield. On the following night two bombs were dropped at Croydon; onehit a theatre causing a number of casualties and the second caused blast damage to a store. On the night of the 15th/16th considerable damage was done to private property at Abbots Langley.On the early morning of the 20th the coast of Kent was shelled. damage was caused to house property at Deal, Ramsgate and Folkestone; casualties atDeal included 10 fatal and 10 serious.Casualties.55. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours onthe 19th were 5 killed and 33 seriously injured, all of which occurred at Croydon.Bougainville.51. Allied activity was on a small scale, consisting mainly of attacks bylight bombers on targets in the Empress Augusta Bay area.The enemy lost three aircraft in four light raids on Torokina. Minor damage was done on Treasury Island (S. of Bougainville) as the result of an attack by18 enemy aircraft.Borneo, Celebes, Timor and Amboina Archipelago.52. On the night of the 12th/13th, Liberators bombed an oil refinery atBalikpapan and targets at Makassar and Dilli.Beaufighters sank a 1,000-ton ship off Dilli and set on fire another of300 tons.Catalinas and Liberators made two night attacks on the docks and shipping in Ambon harbour.Marshall Islands.53. Between the 9th and 14th, 61 Liberators and Mitchells made nineattacks on various targets, mainly shipping, and in addition laid sea-mines offWotje; one medium and five small ships were sunk, a 5,000-ton ship was probably sunk and five other ships, including a probable destroyer, were damaged.On the 12th, about 15 enemy bombers attacked Tarawa damaging eightaircraft on the ground.
APPENDICES I, II, III, IV and VI will be published periodically.APPENDIX  Y.Casualties to H.M. and Allied Auxiliary Vessels and to Nairal Personnel.14th January. Rescue Tug Adherent foundered in the South-WestApproaches.15th January.-M.T.B. 435 and the Polish M.T.B. S. 4 damaged bygrounding off Dover.16th January. L.C.T. 1029 lost, probably by floating mine, at Skegness;nine of crew missing.18th January. Minesweeper- Pelorus damaged in collision in fog off MayIsland.The following casualties to naval personnel have been reported : Officers :  11 killed, 1 missing, 4 wounded.Ratings : 93 killed, 5 missing, 30 wounded.These figures include casualties in H.M.S. Tweed (frigate).APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Bremen. Assessment of damage from photographs taken after three daylight attacks by the U.S.A.A.F. is hampered by cloud, shadow, and a fall of snow. Itcan be seen, however, that considerable damage has been caused to importantbuildings in the Atlas Werke (ship propellers) and some damage in the Ju. 87aircraft factory. Considerable damage has been caused to warehouses, mills and factories in the dock area, and, at least six vessels over 200 feet have been sunk,in addition to many small craft sunk or damaged.Industries, affected include two priority 1 -f and four priority 1 factories.Leipzig. A final interpretation of photographs taken a fortnight afterthe attack on the 3rd/4th December shows that nearly 30 per cent, of the fullybuilt-up town area is in ruins. In the former Leipzig World Fair, none of the17 large buildings now producing aircraft parts remain undamaged, and almost[26757] c
