this document is the property OF his britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944,SECRET.W.P, (44) 21.13th January, 1944.WAR CABINET.Copy No.ARGENTINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AS my colleagues will have observed from recent telegrams from Washington,the United States Secretary of State is very much perturbed at the dangers which,in his view, derive from the constitution and policies of the revolutionary military government which seized power in Argentina at the beginning of June 1943.Mr. Hull conceives that the need to conjure these dangers is urgent, and proposestherefore to &quot;show his teeth &quot; by issuing a denunciatory statement pointing to thefailure of Argentina to act on good pan-American lines, by withdrawing theUnited States Ambassador, possibly immediately, from Buenos Aires, and by taking certain financial and economic sanctions against Argentina as well. he suggests that His Majesty&apos;s Government should, for their part, take similar action.2. The Argentine Government is controlled by a gang of anti-UnitedStates nationalistic and totalitarian-minded Colonels. It almost certainly hada hand in the recent Bolivian revolution, and is probably hoping to fomentsimilar movements elsewhere. Internally, it is adopting an anti-democraticline and externally it is adhering, with no real dissent from public opinion, tothe neutrality policy of its predecessors, thus enabling enemy espionage tocontinue and providing the enemy with a foothold, which he would otherwiselack in the region of considerable present and post-war strategic and economic interest. We may agree with Mr. Hull that, from the United Nations point of view,it would be better if this Government were replaced by another, inspired by anideology more in accord with United Nations&apos; ideals and interests. - unfortunate-nately, however, there is no sign in Argentina of the emergence of any politicalopposition capable of overthrowing the present Government, which is busysecuring its position by the usual totalitarian methods, and according to a reliable source, is about to announce its intention of retaining office for the legal term of six years.3. From a purely British standpoint, this Government is, for reasons of itsown, no doubt, behaving a great deal better than its predecessors, while, from theUnited Nations&apos; standpoint, it has at last taken effective action to control theGraf Spee internees, and is encouraging the conclusion of agreements for thesale to His Majesty Government on behalf of the United Nations of Argentineproducts such as wheat, dairy products, leather, linseed oil, and, above all,meat, which are essential to the United Nations&apos; war effort. [N.B. 31 per cent,of the United Kingdom consumption of meat comes from Argentina, and thereis no possible alternative source of supply.]4. Argentina is, in fact, outstandingly important to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and to the United Nations, now and in the immediately post-war period,as the source of the above-mentioned products. It has hitherto been our policy to promote and, if possible, increase the flow thereof to United Nations&apos;destinations and conversely to avoid action likely to jeopardise this aim.5. While not denying that the constitution- of the present argentine government has a certain danger, we do not share Mr. Hull&apos;s views as to itsgravity and the need for urgent action, and we fear that, while steps such as he proposes to take would, almost certainly, be ineffective to bring about the fall of the Argentine Government or to make it mend its ways, they might actually12249   [26722]
strengthen its internal position and thus put the United States Government andHis Majesty&apos;s Government in a difficult and humiliating situation. Possibly,though not probably, the Argentines might proceed to place impediments in theway of the flow to United Nations&apos; destinations of essential Argentine products.6. We should naturally wish to keep in step with the Americans in a matterof this kind, especially as they are chronically suspicious of us where ourrelations with Argentina are concerned. But, in view of our doubts of, the efficacy of the measures proposed and of the importance of maintaining the flow of Argentine supplies, it is desirable to avoid precipitate action. In thesecircumstances we have proposed an examination in Washington by the CombinedSupply Boards of the probable effect of any action such as Mr. Hull suggests onthe United Nations&apos; war effort above all, in the present crucial year and Ihave now begged Mr. Hull to defer any action in the sense of issuing a statement or of withdrawing his Ambassador from Buenos Aires until I have had time toconsider the matter in all its implications, and until the views of the combined boards on the above-mentioned matters have been ascertained. Mr. Hull&apos;ssubordinates in the State Department, and opinion in the American supply departments and the War Department, are reported to be nearer to our view than to his, and will, we may hope, combined with my appeal, prevent any precipitate action which might jeopardise United Nations&apos; interests in South America andwould place an undesirable strain on Anglo-United States relations.-    A. E.Foreign Office, 13th January, 1944.
