THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECEET.W.P. (44) 23.13th January, 1944.EMPLOYMENT POLICY.Memorandum by the Paymaster-General.THE two attached minutes on employment policy, prepared for the PrimeMinister, are circulated at his suggestion.C.13th January, 1944.(1)EMPLOYMENT  POLICY  IN THE  TRANSITIONAL  PERIOD.THE best way to approach these problems is to study what happened afterthe last war.   (See chart I.)After a few months of unemployment, while industries were switching over from war to peace, there was a brief but violent boom (which reached its peak inthe summer of 1920) whilst stocks were being rebuilt, war arrears of maintenancemade good, and the pent-up demands of foreign countries satisfied. Unemploy-ment was very low, and prices and wages soared. When demand at home andabroad began to slacken and prices to slump, towards the end of 1920, there wasa great increase in unemployment, which reached 1\ million about the middle of1921.* From this figure unemployment gradually recovered to the neighbourhoodof 1^ million and (apart from the coal dispute in 1926) stayed at about this levelfrom 1923 till 1929. With the onset of the great depression at the end of 1929,unemployment mounted, to over 2-J million in just over one year and did not fall below that figure until the middle of 1933, after which we had, a steady decline,to under 1-1 million in the middle of 1937.We may expect a somewhat similar trend of events when this war ends atany rate for the first few years unless steps are taken to check the tendenciesat work.In the first period (perhaps six to nine months) there will be hundreds of thousands seeking work before the factories are prepared to take them.In the second period, when the factories are ready, there will be more demandfor labour than can be met.In the third period, when re-stocking is complete, maintenance arrears aremade good, war savings are spent, and foreign demand slackens (with the com-pletion of reconstruction and re-stocking abroad, and the recovery of our industrial competitors), there will be a tendency to slump and unemployment.The various lines of action which seem appropriate to the changing conditionswhich are to be expected are set forth below in broad outline.* This figure does not include the million miners who stayed on strike for three months, butthe strike aggravated unemployment in other industries.Copy No.WAR CABINET^Si x
First Period.We have to-day about 22 million people gainfully employed.Of these 5 million are in the Services and Civil Defence,nearly    5 million are on Government work in the munitions industries,nearly    2 million are employed directly by national and local Govern-ment authorities,and        3 million  are on other Government work (direct and indirect)in clothing, building, transport, mining, andother industries and services.Total    ...   15 million on Government work.This leaves only 7 million employed on civil and export work (although someof the 15 million working for the Government are not, of course, doing strictlywar work).The problem of demobilisation is to transfer, say, about 10 of the 15 millionback to civil and export work. The remaining 5 million will remain on Govern-ment work or return to the &quot; unoccupied &quot; category.For some of these 10 millions the transfer will be hardly noticeable, e.g., in transport and mining. Many, especially in the munitions industries, will be re-employed by the same firm as soon as the machinery, &amp;c, can be adapted for civil work, e.g., motor vehicles. But many will have to change their occupations. these include demobilised members of the forces,* workers employed on work to whichthere is no peace-time parallel, such as shell filling, and the men and women whowill have to go back to their old jobs to make room for the returning service men.There will thus be a gigantic turn-over of labour, and there is bound to be some unemployment:  (a) while people move from one job to another;ip) while factories are turned over to peace work, and possibly(c) if there is a shortage of coal, transport, skilled labour or imported materials, as happened after the last war.But this &quot; frictional &quot; unemployment should not be accentuated by anygeneral shortage of demand, since(i) The man-power available for civil work will be well below the peace-timelevel for some time, especially during the Japanese war and the periodof occupation of Germany;(ii) there will be a greater demand for civil goods than in peace-time, sinceconsumers will wish to restock their wardrobes, kitchens, &amp;c, andwill have plenty of money to spend out of savings, businesses will want to rebuild their working stocks, to carry out maintenance and extensions postponed during the war, and to adapt their plant to peace-time purposes, tAfter the last war unemployment rose to over a million in April 1919 andthen fell steadily to only 300,000 in the summer of 1920. This time we shouldbe able to do better if, as a result of a two-stage ending of the war, demobilisa-tion can be slowed down, e.g., if we transfer 5 million up to the end of theJapanese war and 5 million thereafter. If, however, we go all out until theend of the Japanese war,l the problem may be even more difficult than last time,since there has been a far higher degree of mobilisation in this war.* These have a legal right to reinstatement in their old jobs for six months. although there are certain safeguards it seems that this obligation may lead to difficulties.f The following table, giving estimates of civil production in 1942 as a percentage of peace-time supplies, affords some idea of the depletion and deterioration of civil stocks that must havetaken place after four years of war:  Footwear      ... ... 70 Towels, bed linen, cutlery, cameras, foun-Clothing       ... ... 45 tarn pens, sports goods and toys        ... 15Books......... 40      Furniture    ............       ... 12Perambulators ... 35 Fancy goods and jewellery         ...       ... 5Bicycles       ... ... 32 Motor bicycles       ...       ...       ...       ... 1Pottery         ... ... 30 Vacuum cleaners, wringers, refrigerators,Pots and pans ... 25 wireless sets, motor cars          ...       ...    Spare parts onlyGlassware     ... ... 20 Carpets, linoleum, wallpaper      ...       ... Nil$ On present plans the 5 + 5 seems likely to be nearer 3 + 7.
Second Period.In this period there should be little difficulty in providing work foreveryone. The main problem (which will also have to be faced in the first period)will be to prevent a rapid rise in prices, for, as has been shown, the pent-updemand for goods will tend to exceed the supply. A price boom would aggravate the tendency to a subsequent slump in two ways : it would lead to artificialspeculative prices; and it would dissipate in higher prices the war savings we wish to hold back until the slump threatens.To prevent an inflation it will not be enough to keep down the cost of livingby subsidies. We shall also have to continue to damp down excessive demand,or, rather, postpone it until the threat of a slump gives the signal for it to beunleashed.   For this purpose the following measures seem apposite : (a) postponing Government expenditure on building, &amp;c, save in urgentcases;(6) postponing private expenditure on buildings and other capital equip-ment, except for the export trade and other urgent work, by licensing and by allocating raw materials, labour, &amp;c.;(c) regulating the increase of rations of manufactured goods, such asclothing, to correspond with the increase in production (the speedat which we can increase our food rations will depend more on overseas supplies);(d) postponing reductions in indirect taxation, and if possible the releaseof post-war credits, so as to prevent too rapid a rise in the moneyspent on consumption; our tax policy should, however, aim atencouraging enterprise and competitive power, above all in the exporttrades, e.g., by reducing E.P.T.Ail these measures will unfortunately be most unpopular and very goodpropaganda will be required to make them acceptable.Before this period ends we must get ready counter-measures to prevent the threatened slump. We must prepare a detailed technique for reversing themeasures (a), (b), (c) and (d) quickly, and we must have schemes of public expenditure ready to start immediately the slump threatens. This means thatcentral and local government authorities and public utilities must prepare planswell in advance.We must also take advantage of the post-war prosperity to diversify, asfar as possible, industry in areas which at present depend too much on one or afew industries. This means that we must give preference to such areas inlicensing new factories and the like and in deciding which munition factories areto be kept permanently in peace-time.We must prepare a statistical technique for forecasting the state of demanda few months in advance, by getting returns of orders on the books of businesses,their projected capital investment, &amp;c.The measures we must take (and prepare for now) are : (a) see that firms are prepared to switch over their capacity to peace-time production as quickly as possible;(&amp;) find out in advance where skilled labour will be required, arrange forany necessary training, if possible get key-men out of the forcesquickly, or perhaps second them for duty on army pay, and perhapsretain the Essential Work Order and direction of labour, so thatskilled workers can be put or kept where they are most needed;(c) ensure, an adequate supply of coal and transport (which means, among other things, the absence of strikes such as are apt to occur in theseperiods) and of raw materials from overseas. We shall also have toretain the machinery for allocating these things to where they are most needed;(d) give a longish period of leave to demobilised soldiers if necessary;perhaps even until a job is offered them;(e) prevent the undue inflation of  the official unemployment statistics,as seems to have happened last time when many women appear tohave registered at the employment exchanges in order to get the out-of-work donation, although they were not really seeking work.
Third Period.When the statistics described above forecast a slump we must begin to reverse the restrictive measures outlined above and try to increase expenditure on bothconsumption and capital goods.  To do this we can (a) encourage local authorities, public utilities and private undertakings to go ahead with their building and other capital programmes, all ofwhich will have been well prepared in advance;(b) free post-war credits, in so far as it has been politically possible to holdthese back during the transitional period; they amount to about 400 million to-day and may rise to  500 million or more by the endof the war;(c) abolish any rationing that may still be in force;(d) remit taxation (the method of deducting income tax weekly or monthlyshould make it easier to do this quickly, and it should also be possibleto change the taxes on drink, tobacco,       fairly quickly);(e) reduce social security contributions.(Under the Beveridge plan the total contribution by worker a,ndemployer is 7s. Qd. a week, and it is reckoned that a variation by 2s. Qd.in either direction would have a direct and indirect effect on total demand of  250 million a year, which represents well over half amillion workers.) Such a reduction in contributions could be regardedas financially sound since a large surplus will have been built up during, the war and transitional periods.If possible these measures should be intensified in areas that threaten tobecome particularly depressed.It is important that the country should be given a clear view of the unemploy-ment position. Just as cancer is considered much more prevalent than formerlylargely because diagnosis is more accurate, so the reason people are apt to thinkunemployment is much worse than formerly may be in part,, at any rate, becauseour statistics of the absolute numbers unemployed are more comprehensive.Even an improvement - in the unemployment position in the post-war yearsmay well appear in the opposite light if absolute figures are quoted,simply because with the rise in the working population and the extension ofunemployment insurance to new classes, culminating in the Beveridge scheme,we shall be insuring after the war about half as many people again as in the earlythirties. Unless the Government is to be unfairly blamed, care should be takene.g., by quoting unemployment in percentages of the insured population, to seethat a true picture of the position is given.Employment problems are particularly difficult to handle because the remedieshave to be applied before the symptoms are obvious. An early application ofthe brake can prevent an unhealthy boom. Conversely a timely touch on theaccelerator can stop a slump developing; if the Americans had adopted in 1930the inflationary measures applied in 1933 the slump would never have reachedsuch unmanageable proportions. But a Government acting in this way will always risk being accused of blocking prosperity just when the country is turningthe corner or, conversely, of irresponsible extravagance just when future prospects are bad.This note does not attempt to go beyond the Third Period, which should carry us three years or more beyond the end of the German war. Thereafteradditional considerations will, of course, have to be taken into account in determining policy.2Qth October, 1943.
Unemployment has been reduced by the harsh necessities of war from the1 to 3 millions of peace time to about 100,000. After 6 to 10 years of full employ-ment during the war and the post-war boom, the British people will not tolerate a return to the old figures. They will demand that the Government produce a programme for achieving comparable results in peace.The electors will not be content with the answer, albeit reasonable, that in- war time 5 million people are in the forces; that the State&apos;s duty to feed, clothe,equip and maintain them makes insatiable demands for labour; that bydirecting labour from one job to another, or even from one region to another, andconversely by siting factories to suit labour conditions, the Government in wartime can reduce to negligible proportions the large number normally out of workmoving from job to job, or while waiting for their particular job to come backto them; and that accelerating inflation would be hard to avoid unless full employment were accompanied by rationing, allocation of materials, the essential work order, compulsory savings, &amp;c. We managed to maintain full employment,they will say, by dressing one-tenth of the population up in uniforms and gettingthem to fire away vast quantities of valuable munitions; surely there is no particular virtue in the homicidal aspect; and, if not, why cannot we obtain thesame result in peace? They will, of course, want to get rid of controls, and inreturn will, no doubt, accept some measure of &apos;&apos; frictional&apos;&apos; unemployment (say,2 J million) whilst people are moving from one job to another. But figures overa million will be repudiated. The problem, therefore, will be, without hugedefence expenditure and with a minimum of war-time controls, to ensure employ-ment figures at any rate comparable with those of to-day.I shall not endeavour to examine in detail the administrative and political implications of the various measures which, in their different ways, would be effective. My object is to set out the various lines of approach and indicate how they would operate. But it seems to me urgent that these matters should be examined from the point of view of practicability, both administrative andpolitical, so that a proper Government programme can be put forward at anearly date.LONG-TERM EMPLOYMENT POLICY.Summary.The public will demand full employment after the war.The experience of the last eighty years shows : I.

Chart II shows approximate unemployment figures from 1860 to the present day. Even a superficial examination shows clearly two important points. Thefirst is the obvious cj^clical nature of employment, which is, of course, geared tothe well-known trade cycle. The second is that, whereas unemployment from1860 to 1914 oscillated about a mean level in the neighbourhood of 5 per cent.,after 1918 it seems to have oscillated about a figure in the region of 13 per cent.Though the exact percentages may be questioned, since the older statistics arenot sufficiently comprehensive or comparable to link on to our modern dataaltogether quantitatively, there seems no doubt that the average level of unem-ployment after the Great War was very much higher than before.It will probably be convenient to consider these two outstanding phenomenain turn.I. Cyclical Unemployment.1. Whatever its origin, the disastrous effect of the trade cycle is due to thewell-known vicious circle of falling demands causing reduced employment, theloss of wages and profits creating, in turn, fresh falls in demand, and so on.Clearly, if the original reduced demands could be offset by increased demands for goods elsewhere, instead of reduced demands owing to loss of wages and profits, this vicious circle would be checked. Indeed, broadly speaking, a slumpcould not develop if demand could be maintained, and demand would be main-tained if either the Government or the public were in a position to buy. It is, Ithink, generally agreed that, if money could be put into circulation when adepression began, and if the very natural reaction of both Government and people to cut down expenditure because times were bad could be overcome, weshould have gone a long way to solve our problem. This was tried in the slumpof the thirties, but the method adopted, namely, to increase the supply of money in the banks and reduce rates of interest in the hope of priming the pump byfostering the demand for capital goods, was, to say the least, slow in operation.Though the banks were stuffed full of money, it did not get into circulation. Wemust therefore consider in what other ways we can force the issue.2. The scale of the problem does not seem unmanageable. In the past, thereal national income of the United Kingdom has probably never oscillated,between periods of boom and slump, by more than 7 per cent, about the meanlevel say,  500 million on a post-war income of  7,000 million. If taken intime a comparatively small intervention should suffice to damp them down.But it is essential to act in the early stages. The brake&apos;has to be applied inthe middle of the penduium&apos;s swing if we want to stop it swinging.3. Whatever may be our theory of the cause of the trade cycle, investiga-tion shows that the main fluctuations in employment in this country originatein our exports, which fluctuate relatively three to four times as widely as the restof the national income. Obviously the.best thing would be to prevent ab initiothese variations in the demand for our exports. In our conversations underArticle VII, we are trying to ensure this. An unexpectedly wide measure ofagreement was reached between our Delegation, headed by the Minister of State,and the Americans. A plan for holding buffer stocks of primary commodities,which would even out the demand of our customers, was discussed. A monetaryscheme to give countries a reasonable cushion of foreign exchange and to preventinterference with the normal flow of trade by sudden changes in the value ofcurrencies, save when the country&apos;s balance of payments renders this essential,has reached an advanced stage. Even the proposal for a general reduction of import duties and a ceiling on tariffs, which was included in our commercialscheme, made some headway.* If these various tentative arrangements betweenthe United Kingdom and the United States can be converted into firm agreements,a very large number of the other nations of the world will almost certainly* The monetary and commercial schemes, far from tying our hands as regards employment policy as is sometimes held, would be of considerable value. They would allow us to depreciatethe pound when our balance of payments was in difficulties as a result of a decline in exports,without the fear of competitive depreciation or the erection of equivalent trade barriers by countries more favourably situated. They would also allow us to pursue an expansionist policywhen a depression threatened, without the fear that it might hamper exports (through rising prices) or unduly stimulate the purchase of imports; for if this happened, and our balance ofpayments became difficult, we should be allowed to depreciate the pound and impose impoiiquotas, again without fear of unwarranted retaliatory action by other countries. The internationalinvestment scheme proposed by the Americans might be so worked as to reduce fluctuations :a world activity as a whole and so in the demand for our exports. Finally, if, as a result of continuing discussions on employment policy itself, anything can be done to stabilise UnitedStates employment at a high level, this will be of great value in ironing out fluctuations in theworld as a whole.
have to fall into line and a great step forward will have been taken in eveningout and promoting the flow of trade. As the greatest trading nation of theworld, we shall stand to gain most of all and our employment problem will be materially eased. But no firm agreement has yet been reached; some doubt whether it will ever be reached, seeing how the tide in American politics isflowing. We must therefore prepare to deal with these cyclical variations whichmay be imposed upon us from abroad by methods within our own control.One way, of course, would be to reduce our dependence on exports by grow-ing more food at home and thus diminishing our imports. The extent to whichthis is feasible is disputed. In any event, it could only come into effect to a notable degree if we made great changes in cur agricultural practice whichobviously would take many years.I will, therefore, in this note consider only the various possible direct modesof intervention, which may be examined seriatim.4. (a) Nowadays, central and local authorities spend a great deal ofmoney on public works. Apart from this the Government can influence, if notcontrol, the timing of a large amount of capital investment by public utilities, &amp;c.To even out the trade cycle such projects should be held back, but kept in a stateof readiness, in buoyant periods of boom and fostered and put into effect inperiods of slump. In this way, it is reckoned, something like 1-fr per cent, ofthe national income might be flung into the scale so as to damp down theoscillations of the trade cycle; and the indirect snowball effect of this variation(through the expenditure of the workers directly employed and so on and so on)should be about as great again, so that the variations would, in all, offsetfluctuations of 3 per cent. ( 200 million) in the national income about the meanlevel. This is an appi-eciable fraction of the 7 per cent. ( 500 million) withwhich we may have to deal, and would in itself contribute to a large extentto even things out.(b) There is another direct means by which the Government can forcemoney in and out of circulation. After the war, unhappily, there seems little doubt that, in one form or another, taxation, together with social security con-tributions, will amount to something like 30 per cent. ( 2,000 million) of thenational income. It is clear, therefore, that a change of, say, 10 per cent, in taxation would directly alter by 3 per cent. ( 200 million) the amount availableto the public for purchasing commodities,^ and this would have a cumulative effect as explained above. Together with controlled investment mentionedunder (a) this would balance the whole fluctuation due to the trade cycle. And,indeed, considerably less would probably be required in reality if we actedquickly, since extreme fluctuations would never develop as they did in the past.This proposal would, of course, have affronted Gladstonian Treasuryofficials since it means a deficit on the budget in bad years and a surplus in good.But from the economists&apos; standpoint there is nothing sacred about the time it takesfor the earth to travel once round the sun. We must get used to thinking on a longer bracket. If the surpluses over a long period balance the deficits, even themost conventional financial expert should have nothing to worry about. We havebeen warned against crucifying mankind on a cross of gold. We must equallybeware of crucifying mankind on the 5th of April.(c) The general measures outlined above will, of course, not suffice to cure the&quot;black spots&quot; in particular industries and areas where employment fluctuateswith special violence. They will help, especially the immediate expenditure on capital investment, since industries producing capital goods are usually subjectto especially large fluctuations. Moreover, if prosperity can be maintainedoverall it will be easier for workers to find jobs in other industries when their normal occupation lapses; and there will be a certain incentive to increase output in places where labour is plentiful. We shall have gone some way to solve ourproblem, in other words, if the cumulative effects of a^slump in the large exportingindustries can be reduced by preventing a resultant fall in the demand forconsumption goods with its well-known cumulative effect.But the decline in a certain industry or area is often appallingly swift. Inthe cotton industry, for instance, unemployment rose from 14 per cenc. to42 per cent., i.e., trebled, in the first six months of 1930.   Unless the international* To illustrate orders of magnitude Is. in the pound on income tax yields about  100 million.\d. a pint on beer about  15 million.Id. on 10 cigarettes (with a similar tax on tobacco) about  30 million.5d. a week in insured persons&apos; contributions to social insurance about  20 million.4cJ. a week in employers&apos; contributions to social insurance about  15 million.
arrangements on which we have been working come into effect this sort of thing islikely to continue.To forestall this it is most desirable to diversify so far as is possible industryin the black areas, i.e.. the areas depending largely on one or two industries,especially where these are working for the export trade. A region with half itsworkers employed getting coal, three-fifths of which is shipped overseas, as inSouth Wales in the early twenties, is bound to be at the mercy of events abroad,which British Ministers cannot hope to control. The Government can help todiversify industry by maintaining, where possible, munition factories in these areas, and by encouraging industries producing consumption goods for the home market to go there. In munition factories service programmes, which in peace-time are comparatively elastic, might be expanded or contracted to suit thecircumstances. In some cases we might even consider keeping internalbuffer stocks of manufactured goods such as cotton goods, steel, tinplate,ships, for which the demand is unstable. And, of course, the black areas should be given priority where possible for public works. Purchasing power inthe locality might be maintained by temporary local reductions in the social insurance contributions, though this has obvious dangers. If necessary some formof compulsory short-time, supplemented by payments from the insurance fund,could be introduced. We might even consider giving coupons for the purchase ata cheap rate of consumer goods produced by the industries affected as has beendone in the United States.One great difficulty inherent in applying these measures will be, of course,to tell whether the decline is temporary or permanent. In the slump of the&quot;thirties, for example, employment in both the cotton and the engineering industries fell by well over one-quarter, but whereas &quot;engineering was destinedto expand again well above its previous level, cotton never recovered appreciably.It will not be easy to decide when the measures necessary and appropriate to tidea given industry over a bad patch should give way to those required when an industry is irretrievably passing into a state of decay.II. The Average Level of Unemployment.1. So far we have considered mainly the types of policy required to curecyclical unemployment. But even if these policies are successful there may stillbe a more enduring problem. Though our statistics before 1914 are Uncertainthere seems no doubt that the average level of unemployment increased markedlyafter the last war.   Various reasons have been adduced to account for this (i) Foreign countries learnt  during the war  to make many of  the commodities we had formerly exported,(ii) We were under-cut in the export markets by European countries withdepreciated currencies.(iii) We were reluctant to invest in countries abroad of doubtful financialand political stability; hence these countries could not buy so much from us.(iv) We were deprived of a large part of our markets in India, Russia and japan by political changes.There is a great deal of truth in all of these reasons, and the fact that theincreased unemployment in the &quot;&apos;twenties was roughly equal to the reduction inthe number of workers employed in the export trades lends colour to the viewthat our troubles originated in these foreign markets. It may well be that similar tendencies will occur after this war and unhappily it is very difficult tocontrol conditions abroad. It is for this reason that we should spare no efforts to make a success of the negotiations now in train with the Americans.2. There remains, however, the very pertinent question why the labour and productive capacity set free by the reduced demand for exports was not switchedover more quickly to producing for the home market. This surely was within our control.Once again a number of reasons, many of them substantial, have been putforward.  If we examine them one by one the remedies will be obvious : (a) We need not, I trust, waste any time on the utterly fallacious reasonoften cited that production had become so easy that supply exceededdemand. This &quot;economics of glut&quot; theory implies that all humandemands had been satiated; it will only be true when the last man who wants one has got his Rolls-Royce and then only if no newinventions are made causing him to ask for something else.
(b) There is more force in the explanation that labour;s incentive to seek a new job when thrown out of work is nowadays much smaller, thanks to the social services, than in Victorian times when unemploymentspelt the workhouse, and that this caused, e.g., cotton-spinners inLancashire to hang on waiting for the cotton trade to revive insteadof pushing about and looking for alternative employment. To acertain extent this is true and we must not underestimate theimportance of making sure that conditions of work are preferable tolife on the dole. But, of course, this is only one aspect. In Victoriantimes, with a rapidly rising population, when nearly all industries were flourishing, it was a matter of one industry expanding slower than others, or at worst standing still. The sons would go into thenew buoyant trades; the parents would stay. Nowadays we have to cope with hard definite falls in demand. To find new jobs, middle-aged people, some of whom own their houses or are buying them through the Building Societies, would have to move to other parts ofthe country. Moreover, a higher degree of specialised skill is requiredin the various industries than formerly; nor do Trade Unionregulations facilitate a change.The remedies seem to be, not so much migration away from thedepressed area, with all the loss in accumulated social values thiswould involve,* as to start and. develop new industries there, to arrangefor training workers desirous of changing their occupation, and tomake agreements with the Trade Unions by which they can be absorbed.,(e) As a counterpart to (,&amp;) we are often told that high taxation has reduced the incentive to the entrepreneur to start or extend industries; andthat the small man, on the other hand, finds it hard to start in business in competition with the mass producer.In so far as this factor is material, it emphasises the importanceof giving due reward to enterprise and initiative. Tax relief, and,possibly Government loans, to small rising firms and nascentindustries, should be considered sympathetically. If our dying-industries are to be replaced by new ones, we must look to energetic,active, young men, who see some prospect of. making a place for them-selves in the world. To pillory them for being inspired by &quot; the profitmotive &quot; is unjust. Their motives are no more immoral than those ofthe worker who wants a higher wage or of any professional man whotakes particular -trouble over his duties in the hope of finding &quot; alarger sphe*re of usefulness &apos;&apos; elsewhere, even though it be linked witha larger salary.(d) The most esoteric explanation of unemployment which commends itselfespecially to academic economists is that humanity&apos;s incurabletendency to save money may not always be matched by sufficiently attractive investment opportunities, and so may inhibit demand.This danger has, in my view, attracted an undue amount of attention in certain circles at the expense of more argent problems.Admittedly, the position was easier in the half-century before the last war. Annual investment, or the addition to the capital stock of thecommunity, which probably averaged about 10 per cent, to 15 per cent,of the national income, was made up of three parts, each of comparableimportance : (i) Investment abroad, in the form of a surplus of exports (visible andinvisible) over imports. It will be a good many years before we can build up our export markets once again to a point atwhich foreigners take more from us than we import from them.(ii) The accumulation at home of capital equipment, houses, &amp;c, tokeep pace with the rise in population. This process has now come to an end.(iii) An increase in the amount of capital per head (better houses,-increased mechanisation, &amp;c).   It is on this type of investmentthat we must mainly rely for some time to come.* The scale of migration required will by itself often rule out this solution, For example,South Wales was so badly hit after 1923 that one-quarter of the population would have had to be moved &quot;to cure unemployment there, before the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 made theproblem even worse.
Thus two of-our three main outlets for investment in the past arenow closed for the time being at least. But we need not meet ourtroubles before they arise. Scientific discoveries and new inventionswill tend to create fresh investment opportunities, especially if enter-prise is fostered and the rate of interest on borrowed money is not too high. Nor is there any certainty that the desire to save may notweaken as social conditions change. If the problem turned out tobe serious, it would not be difficult to find remedies, e.g., bydiscouraging the accumulation of undue reserves through taxremission to companies (companies are responsible for about half oursavings) which employ their savings in extensions and new projectsat the expense of the less enterprising concerns which neither investtheir earnings nor distribute them.If the position really became so acute that measures of this sortwere not enough, the difficulty could, of course, be met by unbalancingthe budget. The Treasury in this way would spend the money and create the required demand on behalf of the miserly public. Themiserly public would receive in return a growing volume of Govern-ment securities.   What better security could it ask ?Compared with our other commitments, the scale of the processis not great say,  100 million a year. If we can face an increaseof over  100 million in the national debt every fortnight in war-time, we need not be terrified by a similar increase once a year ifthis should be necessary to prevent unemployment in peace. the extra interest charged say  3 million a year - would be coveredmany times over by the natural rise in national income and taxable capacity, which should amount to about  100 million per annum,judging by past experience, even allowing for a stationary population.There is, of course, a very definite line between the beneficentdeficit which cures unemployment and the excessive deficit leading to inflation, but, though this distinction is clear to statisticians, itmay not be easy to make it clear to the electorate, or even to somevote-hungry politicians anxious to appease constituents clamouringfor bread and. circuses.*III. The Need for Speedy Administrative Action.As emphasised in my note on employment policy in the transitional period,a comparatively small intervention in the early stages before a slump has realtydeveloped is far more effective than much greater efforts when all the cumulativeeffects have come into play. In 1920-21 unemployment rose from 5 per cent, to15 per cent, in four months. It is therefore essential that the Governmentshould be in a position to act in the very early stages, or even to anticipate athreatened slump. For this purpose it is essential to get the required statisticaldata quickly and to analyse them without delay.Returns of unemployment, production, &amp;c, should be taken at frequent intervals (in some cases weekly), and the results made available within a few days.Orders placed, especially those with the large exporting firms, would provean invaluable pointer. Information about changes in stocks held would be agreat help in forecasting future developments. Projected capital expenditure by firms and local authorities should be collected. Naturally, all such information should be treated as absolutely confidential. If they could be sure that neithertheir competitors, creditors nor anyone else had. access to the details, I do notbelieve that, industry would object to giving the data. A really competenteconomic and statistical section in possession of the facts could analyse and cross-check them and present a monthly (or perhaps weekly) report to the appropriate minister or ministerial committee. This, together with a study of conditions inforeign countries, should allow a reasonably accurate forecast of the trend ofemployment so that rapid steps could be taken to forestall changes in industrial conditions.* There is much to be said for the practice frequently advocated, and-adopted I believe in sweden, of having an annual budget which must be balanced in the year and a capital account which may or may not be balanced by revenue according to the state of employment. Public-works, armaments, &amp;c, which maintain their value over many years naturally come into the-capital account; national debt interest, pensions, civil servants&apos; salaries, &amp;c, come clearly intothe annual budget. Though the separation makes no difference in the realities, it might be politically expedient as softening the affront to the old-fashioned mind of an unbalanced hudgetand forestalling to a certain extent the limitless demands of sectional interests.
Naturally, this would involve inter-budgetary changes in taxation, or atthe very least, variations in social security contributions. How this could bedone without undue changes in our constitutional procedure requires examina-tion. When speedy action is required, it will practically always be to prevent a slump developing; this will mean the reduction of taxation, not the impositionof fresh burdens, so that serious opposition in the House would be unlikely.Parliament might agree to a clause in the Finance Act giving the government authority, in case of need, to make limited remissions of taxation, havingimmediate effect-but subject to subsequent ratification.From many points of view, of course, there would be advantage in making such variations depend automatically upon definite criteria such as the degreeof unemployment. This would prevent log-rolling and avoid delay in Govern-ment committees. On the other hand, there is much to be said for ad hocdecisions by some responsible Minister or ministerial committee. Automaticchanges can only derive from statistics of what has happened in the past; ad hocdecisions can be based on intelligent forecasts. So many variables, political aswell as economic, are involved that it seems unlikely that an automatic formulacould be found to suit all eventualities. The question is whether it is not evenmore unlikely that we shall be able to find a man capable of forming a soundjudgment, taking account of all these variables, who would be entrusted with this great responsibility by the House of Commons.Probably some intermediate answer would be best. But one thing is certain,and that it that almost anything is likely to be better than to let matters take their course, as has tended to happen in the past.Although it seems useful to set out all these long-range unemploymentproblems, I trust discussion of them will not be allowed to interfere with themeasures necessary for the transitional period. The great testing time will come when the slump threatens after the anticipated immediate post-war boom. unless we prove able to meet and overcome this danger, our whole social and economic structure will, in my view, be in jeopardy.Qth January, 1944.
