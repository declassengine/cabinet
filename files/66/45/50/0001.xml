(43) 563.In paragraphs 13-15 of the Report relating to the disposal of the Arabareas, the Committee suggest that it would be an immense advantage if SouthLebanon cum Galilee and the enlarged Trans-Jordan could be fused with Syria.This proposal would involve the transference to Syria of the portion of Lebanonsouth and east of Sidon, so that Galilee would obtain a physical connection with greater Syria, to which it would pass. The Committee believed that there were indications that no strong objections would be raised by the Lebanese to theproposed slight truncation of their State.2. But Mr; Casey has recently pointed out that, even if difficulties over the mandates and timing permitted of the Greater Syria plan proceeding, it did not seem likely, in view of the recent developments in the Lebanon, that the detach-ment of any part of South Lebanon, with the object of uniting it to Syria, would meet with anything but opposition from the area concerned and the Lebanon as awhole. &quot; We should still, therefore, have to envisage a corridor from Galileethrough Huleh to Syria unless Galilee were to be attached to the Lebanon.&quot;3. The Committee have considered this question further in the light ofMr. Casey&apos;s comments and the majority now recommend, as an alternative to the transference to Greater Syria of the portion of Lebanon south and east of Sidon,an adjustment of territory to provide a link between Galilee and Syria whichwould skirt the Huleh Valley on the west and north sides so as to provide aphysical connection between Galilee and Syria which would not cross Lebanonterritory. The proposed new corridor is shown as part of Galilee (colouredyellow) on the amended map annexed hereto. The transference to Greater Syriaof the area comprised in this strip of territory would involve the detachment fromthe Jewish State of 10,740 Arabs and 1,260 Jews; total 12,000; and, in terms ofland, of 65-7 square miles of Arab land and 7-8 square miles of Jewish land,giving a total (with roads, rivers, &amp;c.) of approximately 74 square miles.(Initialled)H.
