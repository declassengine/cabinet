(44) 43.25th January, 1944./WAR CABINET.REQUIREMENTS OF BUILDING LABOUR FOR  &quot; CROSSBOWDISPERSALS.IN another paper (W.P. (44) 42) I am submitting recommendations for theallocation of building labour for the current half year. It will be seen that theproposed allocations are, in almost every case, below the requirements putforward by Departments. In addition to the possibility of unforeseen demands,further inroads on the general allocations may be required in respect of certainemergency measures discussed below arising out of &apos;&apos; Crossbow.&quot;2. It was agreed on the 5th November, 1943 (Gen. 26/1st Meeting, Item 3),that plant should only be moved out of London or the vulnerable area to manufacture a store which was at present produced only within that area. TheAdmiralty and the Ministry of Supply have put forward no requirements for fresh building in this connection. The Ministry of Aircraft Production,however, although they have made some dispositions which do not require freshbuilding, have found it impossible to make arrangements for certain production which seems to them to fall within the above category. To deal with this position,they have now made certain proposals involving substantial building during thecurrent half-year.   Details are set out in the Annex to this paper.3. Inter-Departmental discussions have made it clear that the accommo-dation required can only be provided by building and in discussion between myDepartment and the Ministry of Aircraft Production the suggestion was accepted that the six hangar factories referred to in paragraph 1 (a) of the annex to this paper should be erected as a safeguard. The Ministry of aircraft production have felt it necessary, however, to propose some additional provision.4. It is agreed that the small extensions and modifications referred to inparagraphs 3 and 4 of the Annex to this paper can be dealt with out of the bulkallocation of building labour to the Ministry of Aircraft Production, but I am advised that the provision, in time to meet the need, of the six emergencyfactories in the form of prefabricated hangars, and the accleration of the radiovalve factories, will jointly require, in the current half-year, a labour force of3,000 in excess of the Ministry of Aircraft Production^ allocation. these buildings are all to be erected in areas where a certain amount of immobilebuilding labour can probably be made available, although more than half the requirement, especially for tradesmen, will certainly have to be met from the mobile pool. In any event, the whole 3,000 will have to be counted against thebulk allocations for Government work, and they can be found with the necessaryspeed only at the expense of other urgent work and by according the projects thesame preferential treatment as was originally accorded to &quot; Phoenix.5. If provision is to be made either for the erection of the hangar factoriesor for the increased accommodation suggested by M.A.P. there will have to be either appreciable inroads into the already reduced MAP. allocation or a numberof smaller reductions in each of the Departmental allocations of building labour.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.[26777]
ANNEX.Ministry of Aircraft Production Building Proposals in Relation to&quot; Crossbow.&quot;1. Prefabricated Hangars.(a) It is proposed to erect six reserve factories totalling 300,000 square feetin the form of prefabricated hangars to be taken from stock and to be erected two in Scotland, two in the Northern Region and two in Wales.These hangars can be made available as soon as the sites are prepared and no additional labour will be needed to make them. They will,however, be erected as proper factories although a certain amountof work on services in connection with them will be deferred, untiltheyare about to be occupied.To provide the six factories a labour force of about 1,500 in thecurrent half-year will be needed.(b) Two similar factories are to be established in Northern Ireland.  Building-labour for these factories can be supplied without difficulty as thereis ample supply of constructional workers in Northern Ireland.(c) It is the intention to allocate these eight factories provisionally to particular firms which will be instructed to make all necessary prepara-tion to move should an emergency arise and two have already been so earmarked to rehouse a vital plant for starter mechanisms for theMerlin aero-engine.2. Radio Valve Factories.The Ministry of Aircraft Production, with the approval of the Radio Board,are proceeding, as part of a long-term expansion of the radio valve industry, to erect three factories each of 120,000 square feet, to be located one in Scotland, one in the Northern Region and one in Wales. They will be operated under themanagement of the Cossor, Cosmos and Mullard Companies.It is proposed that these factories should now be built more quickly on accountof &quot; Crossbow&quot; in order that they may be available if required to rehouse the plant and equipment now operated, by these three Companies in their Londonfactories. Seventy-four per cent, of the total valve production and 87 per cent, ofCathode Ray Tube production is concentrated in the London area, and thereforethis measure of insurance is considered by the Ministry of Aircraft production to be essential. It has the full support of the Radio Board. These three factories are producing for all the Services and the Admiralty and Ministry of Supplytherefore are, to some extent, participants in this scheme.If these factories are to be built more quickly we shall have to rely to a muchgreater extent on mobile building labour from the pool than would, have been thecase had they been built over a longer term.To complete these factories sooner as a Crossbow &apos;&apos; measure a labour forceof 1,500 in the current half-year would be needed.3. Smaller Extensions.It is proposed to build at once a number of small extensions for selectedvital firms but to hold these in reserve. In the aggregate they are unlikely to exceed 100,000 square feet and it is agreed that the building labour required willbe provided from the Ministry of Aircraft Production bulk allocation.4. Modifications of existing Buildings.Modifications will be required in a number of existing buildings which arebeing requisitioned to rehouse production either rmmediately or, in some cases,in an emergency. The labour required for this purpose will also be found fromthe bulk Ministry of Aircraft Production allocation.I shall be glad to have guidance, in the light of the latest information about&quot; Crossbow,&quot; whether and on what basis provision should be made, either for thewhole or part of the programme set out in the Annex to this paper.O. L.Great George Street, S. W. 1,25th January, 1944.
