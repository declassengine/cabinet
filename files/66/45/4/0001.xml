(44) 4.3rd January, 1944.WAR CABINET.VEMPLOYMENT OF A BRITISH WEST INDIAN CONTINGENT IN a theatre OF WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.FOR some months I have been discussing with the Secretary of State for Warthe possibility of sending a West Indian contingent overseas to an active theatre of war. The many difficulties have been overcome and the Secretary of State forWar now considers it practicable to move a West Indian contingent to serve withthe Central Mediterranean Force as soon as possible after April 1944, providedthat transport can be made available. This will involve an approach to the combined Chiefs of Staff for American shipping.My predecessors and I have, since the early days of the war, urged thedesirability of sending a West Indian contingent overseas, and all information from the local civilian and military authorities confirms that the inhabitants ofthe West Indies are disappointed and restive at having such very limitedopportunities of taking an active part in the war. A few specially selected menfrom this area have come over here to join the Royal Air Force as aircrews, and ascheme for recruitment of ground staff is now in operation in the West Indies, butthere are no outlets at present for men who want to serve overseas in a west indian unit.The local disappointment already felt at this state of affairs is likely to be considerably increased by the recent move of United States Puerto Rican troops into certain of the British West Indian Colonies, including Jamaica, the mostself-conscious political community among them. I agreed to the move with considerable reluctance, especially in the case of Jamaica, and the apprehensions of its effect expressed by the Governor and military authorities in that island havebeen made known to the Americans. There can be no doubt that the announcementof a decision to send a West Indian contingent to a theatre of war would be mostwarmly received in all the Caribbean colonies, and I feel we are in a particularlystrong position for asking the Americans to help with shipping since we have metthem over the matter of the Puerto Ricans.Before the approach is made to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, the Secretaryof State for War and I thought that the War Cabinet should be made aware of theposition.&apos; &apos;&quot;  * - &apos;        . &quot;  - - -   O.
