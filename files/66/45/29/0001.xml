I am much concerned at the proposals made, in theMemorandum by the Minister of War Transport (war. (44)26).Since last Autumn I have emphasised that adequate trans-port must be available if my Ministry was to carry out theminimum programme necessary to meet coal r-oqu-irements athome and for 0VSRL0RDo      This  programme will bring down thetotal distributed stocks &quot;by April 30th to 12 million tons,a figure that includes the 2 million tons   which,   it hasbeen agreed with the War Departments, shall be held asreserve   stock for OVERLORD^2.       , Shortage of waggons  in recent weeks resulted in serious losses of coal and it became clear that if thequantity of coal carried could not be increased over thepresent rate distributed stocks at April 30th would fall below 10 million tons,      I therefore asked the lord president Ts Committee to  sanction an over-riding priority for the transport of coal      This was not granted, but itwas left that the Minister of War Transport was to arrangefor the possibility of restricting or reducing the move-ment of goods traffic, other than coal,  to be kept under constant review by the Central Transport Committee, both as regards the immediate situation, and as regards thesituation as it was likely to be in a few months&apos;time(Conclusion 2, Lord President^ Committee Meeting, 7thJanuary, 19443. Nevertheless the Minister of War Transport now appears to be proposing that a further reduction be madein coal traffic0      I feel I must point out to my colleagues that any further reduction in the volume of coaltransport can only be achieved at the expense of war production, of the domestic consumer, or of the coal set aside for OVERLORD.Go  Lie   G,Ministry of Fuel and Power,7, Millbank,
