14 thVJahua r y, 1944WAR    CABINETDELEGATED   LEG-ISLATIONCONTROL.   OP   PARLIAMENT    OVERDEPARTMENTAL &quot; REGULATIONS   .AND   OHDEHSNOTE BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL, S^VICE1.      I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues to an amend-in en t to the Disabled Persons (Employment) Bill that has been putdown - in the name of Mr. Erskine-Hill (Cons., Edinburgh N.) andothers and which will &quot;be moved when&quot;the Committee Stage of that bill is taken on the next sitting day.     The amendment seeks toprovide that no regulations or orders made under the Bill shallhave effect until they have been approved by affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament.     This is contrary to the proposals at present contained in.the Bill which provide that regulations and orders shall be laid before Parliament as soon as may be after they are made and may be annulled by resolution of either Houseof Parliament if a prayer is presented within 28 sitting days      *-next after the laying of the regulations or orders. i,2.     The regulations to be made under the Bill are confined to(a)    matters relating  to the., entry and retention in thesuitable for disabled persons.     These orders can only be madeRegister of the names of persons handicapped &quot;bydisablement;    and(b)    matters of procedure;whilst the&apos; orders that can bo made are orders fixing the standard and special percentages which determine an employer1s quota underthe Bill -and orders designating classes of employment speciallyafter previous consultation with the appropriate employers&apos; and workers&apos;  organisations.
3.     On merits, therefore, and having regard to previous precedents&quot;both before and since the war, there seemed to me to bo no sufficient reason for requiring affirmative resolutions of each House ofParliament before either regulations or orders could be madeunder the Bill.     The normal procedure of annulment by prayerreferred to above was accordingly provided for &quot;by the Bill,This procedure is, of course, the normal peacetime procedure andoannot   in any sense be said to be a special procedure that hasrecently been &quot;brought into force owing to wartime conditions.In faot, the procedure provided for by the Bill is the procedurethat has almost invariably been adopted for many years before thewar for regulations and orders of this kind,     I am advised thatthe only cases in which affirmative resolutions have &quot;been providedfor in the past were cases in which Regulations or Orders haveamended the provisions of a statute or have contained provisionsaffecting money payable by the Exchequer,     A typical example ofthe sort of case in which affirmative resolutions have hitherto been thought to be necessary is the provision made by the unemployment assistance Act, 1934, which requires that regulations determining the scales of allowances to ho paid by the Assistance Board shallho approved by affirmative resolution before they come into force.4.     According to recent articles in the Press it would seem thatthe real object of this amendment is directed not so much to the merits of the particular proposals about regulations and orders made under the Bill as to the general objection felt by some members to delegated legislation.     It is stated, for example, inan article in the &apos;Observer&apos; of 9th January, 1944, that &quot;A  -challenge to the power of Ministers to govern by regulations will he issued when Parliament reassembles after the recess.A sharp reminder of Parliament&apos;s dislike of dologated legislation and of the possession of abnormal power by the executive was givenin a unanimous resolution passed after the Debate in the House ofCommons last year on 26th May.     The new protest is to be made on
the Committee Stage of the Tomlinjon Bill, the Disabled Persons(Employment) Bill&quot;.     It is for this reason that I have thoughtit necessary to bring the matter to the notice of ray colleagues,,5.      So far as the Disabled Persons (Employment) Bill is concerned,I have no very strong feelings about the amendment either way,hut my colleagues might well feol that if I were to accept theprinciples of the amendment on this occasion I should &quot;beestablishing an undesirable precedent which it might be difficultto depart from later on in other cases.-6.     For the above reasons I should be glad to have the advice of my colleagues as to what action I ought to take in regard tothis amendment.E. B.
