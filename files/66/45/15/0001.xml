this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.MOST secret.P. (44) 15.8th January, 1944.Copy No.   war CABINET.ITALY: PROPOSED PUBLICATION OF LONG ARMISTICE TERMS.AT their meeting* on the 3rd January, 1944, the War Cabinet discussed thedesirability of publishing the long armistice terms, and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs expressed the view that, unless military objections still existed,he would like to see the terms published. We were invited to give further con-sideration to the matter and report to the War Cabinet in time to enable a decisionto be taken before Parliament met.2. In our view, there are four objections to publication, each of which has some military aspect: (a) Loss of Co-operation from Italian Armed Forces;(b) It would furnish valuable material for Axis and Fascist propaganda;(c) It would give certain Sections of the Press the opportunity of initiatingcorrespondence which might react to our disadvantage by providingammunition for Axis and Fascist propaganda;(d) It might so discredit the Badoglio Government as to cause its collapse,3. The arguments under, (a), (b) and (c) are particularly pertinent at thepresent time. Publication of the terms would provide Germany with a usefulopportunity to point out to her satellites that however hard the Italian terms were, the conditions offered to them would be much harsher thus encouraging their continued resistance. Similarly, it would greatly prejudice, if it did not nullify,any advantage which might be gained should it be decided to amplify or define&quot; Unconditional Surrender.&quot;4. Furthermore, the considerable anti-Fascist elements now actively engagedin resistance and sabotage in Northern Italy might well be discouraged in their efforts.5. The argument under (d) also carries considerable weight. We have encouraged and supported the Badoglio Government with a view to handing overthe administration of liberated Italian territory from the Allied Commander-in-Chief to the Italian Government, and the intention to effect this transfer hasalready been made public and it is about to take place.6. Though the people of Southern Italy may be war-weary and apathetic,nevertheless the Badoglio Government is not so firmly established that we can afford to take any action which might bring about its collapse or further weakenits already precarious position.Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff.* W.M. (44) 1st Meeting.[26696]
7. If the Badoglio Government were to collapse before we are frimly established in Rome, the chances of setting up another Government with whichwe could deal, and which would be capable of administering the territory, are small and we might well be faced with a breakdown of administrationnecessitating the re-establishment of Allied Military Government. For military reasons alone this would be most undesirable.8. These arguments have previously been fully supported by general eisenhower as Allied Commander-in-Chief, who is of the opinion that publica-tion of the terms should be withheld.9. We are therefore of the opinion that on military grounds publication ofthe long terms is undesirable at present.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.F. A. PORTAL.A. B. CUNNINGHAM.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.-W. 1,8th January, 1944.
