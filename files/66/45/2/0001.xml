THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTSPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF LABOUR, EQUIPMENT ANDMATERIAL FOR INVASION OPERATIONS.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service and minister of Production.The planning of operations connected with the invasion of Europe shows the necessity of providing additional labour and resources of material andequipment for numerous services which must be provided when the final periodof build-up for the attack arrives, and during the launching of the assault.2.   Typical services might be : (a) Ship repair yards and dock yards dealing with His Majesty&apos;s ships and merchant vessels concerned in the operations.(b) Specially organised repair facilities to deal with landing craft, coastalcraft and the like.(c) Repair facilities for damaged landing stages, grids, hards, &amp;c.(d) Armament depots and dumps, store depots, &amp;c.(e) Emergency repairs to communications and transport services.Services of this category will require prompt manning when the time arrives,and the transfer of such equipment and material as may be necessary.3. To a considerable extent it will be possible to formulate the&apos; require-ments now and to earmark the production or services which must supplylabour, materials and equipment which cannot be made available by the FightingServices. There will, however, be requirements, the extent of which cannot before seen, and which will have to be dealt with as and when they arise.4. It is realised that other services and production must suffer dislocationor stoppage if the desired facilities are to be supplied in the fullest measure and in the shortest space of time.5. We accordingly ask for Cabinet approval of the principle that duringthe period of the operation any materials, equipment or labour required for itmay be diverted from other production or services. So far as contractors&apos; plant and labour for building and civil engineering work is concerned, there is alreadyadequate machinery in the form of the Emergency Works Services for giving effect to this principle. Special arrangements for other classes of work mayhave to be devised.6. In order to ensure that such requirements may be met with the least possible disturbance to important programmes or services, we propose that our respective Ministries should act together in examining special requirements ofthis character for invasion operations, making immediate plans to meet them sofar as this is possible, and deciding in detail how any further needs should bemet as and when they arise.7. To enable this to be done, we would ask that any Department responsiblefor any service related to the operation, when revising its estimates of additionalequipment, material and labour likely to be required to meet all contingencies,Printed for the War Cabinet.

should indicate to us as soon as possible the nature and extent of any difficultiesthey foresee.8.   It would be our joint responsibility to see that other Departments whichmight be affected by our decisions under this head were advised as soon as theappropriate proposals had been adopted. . .,E.
