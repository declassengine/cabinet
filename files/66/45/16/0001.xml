(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).secret.P. (kk)   16.8TH JANUARY,   ^^l\h^WAR CABINETREINSTATEMENT IN CIVIL EMPLOYMENT BILL:POSITION OF CIVIL DEFENCE PERSONNEL.Memorandum by the- Minister of Reconstruction.1.    As the Home Secretary says in vy. p. (hh)   6,  the question of extending reinstatement rights to Civil Defence volunteers has beenconsidered by the Reconstruction Committee.2.    The Committee recognised that this was a difficult issue,and that the Bill as now drafted might cause some feeling in theCivil Defence Services.      The Committee came, however, to theconclusion that the right course was to leave the Bill as it now stands.3.    Reinstatement rights, which originally applied to personscalled up for pre-war training in the militia and were extende.dat the outbreak of war to persons called up for military service,are generally identified in the public mind with service in the armed Forces.      It is true that these rights extend to the small proportion of people in Civil Defence who were compulsorily enrolledin the Civil Defence Forces under the National Service Act of 19h1;but this  is so, not by any deliberate decision of policy, but as anincidental consequence of their having been called up under theprocedure for call-up to the Armed Forces.      In the view of theCommittee it would be wrong,- merely because reinstatement rightsare enjoyed by this relatively small number of Civil Defence personnel,to extend to the whole body of volunteers  in Civil Defence asystem which has always been associated with service in the armed forces.h.    The Committee took the view that reinstatement rightsshould be confined broadly to the Armed Forces;    and that the Billshould be justified on the basis that reinstatement rights did notapply to Civil Defence as such,  though they happened to extend toa relatively small number of persons in Civil Defence who had been called up under the procedure applicable to the Armed Forces.VI &apos;COPY NO.Richmond Terrace,  S.W.1.8th January, 19hh.
