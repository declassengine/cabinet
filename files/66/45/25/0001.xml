NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Destroyers operating in the Adriatic have inflicted losses on enemy shipping and have successfully shelled Italian coastal railways.One of H.M. submarines has sunk a Japanese cruiser off Penang.One U-boat has been sunk, two probably sunk, one possibly sunk and twopossibly damaged.Shipping losses have been light.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. A convoy of eight ships from North Russia, escorted by destroyers, has arrived in Home Waters.On the 7th H.M.S. Tweed (frigate), while operating with an escort groupagainst U-boats, was torpedoed and sunk 600 miles west of Cape Finisterre.Eight officers, including the Captain, and 44 ratings were rescued.Mediterranean.3. H.M. destroyers have carried out nightly patrols in the CentralAdriatic. On the night of the 6th/7th Grenville and Ulster shelled two trainsat San Giorgio, one of which was hit. On the following night Jervis and Janusdamaged two trains and blew up a locomotive&quot;: they also sank three schooners andbombarded San Benedetto and the railway centre at Ancona. On the night ofthe 8th/9th Troxibridcje and Tumtdt damaged four schooners, which were laterabandoned, damaged two trains and bombarded San Benedetto. On the following night they shelled three trains, setting one on fire, bombarded San Benedetto anddrove a schooner ashore which was damaged by gun fire. On the night of thelOth/llth Tynan and Grenville shelled the railway and a train at Civltanovaand bombarded Pedaso.4. The French S/M Casabianca, on patrol off the French Riviera, sank anA/S ship on the 22nd December and torpedoed a 4,000-ton ship on the 28th.The French S/M protection is overdue from patrol off Toulon and must be consideredlost.5. On the Adriatic coast violent weather has recently reduced the amountof supplies discharged. For the week ending the 23rd December at the west coast ports 96,219 tons of stores, 5,903 vehicles and 47,145 personnel were discharged,and at the east coast ports 78,218 tons of stores, 2,860 vehicles and 24,172personnel.6. Reconnaissance of Spezia on the 2nd showed that all the quays had beenprepared for demolition. The deck plating on the cruiser Gorizia was beingreplaced. At Genoa on the 7th two F-boats were seen to have been recentlylaunched.   A liner was lying on her side and partly submerged.Levant.7. On the 25th December H.M. S/M Torbay damaged a caique north ofCrete. On the 9th January two caiques were sunk by M.Ls. north of Rhodes;prisoners were captured.East Indies.8. On the 11th H.M. S/M Tally-Ho sank a Japanese cruiser off Penang.Further details have not yet been received.Pacific.9. Several ships of the Japanese main fleet are at present refitting andothers are employed transporting troops.New Ireland.10. The two cruisers which were attacked on the 1st by U.S. carrier-borne aircraft when entering Kavieng harbour were not seriously damaged, as previously reported, and were able to leave the harbour without difficulty. In afurther attack by the same carrier-borne aircraft on Kavieng on the 4th two destroyers were torpedoed and probably sunk.
New Guinea.11. Allied light craft operating at night off the N.E.- coast have sunk large number of enemy barges, many of which were carrying troops.Solomons.12. On the night of the 8th/9th a force of Allied cruisers and destroyers bombarded targets in the Shortland area, and on the following night U.S.destroyers bombarded enemy positions at Choiseul Bay.Anti-Submarine Operations.13. Nineteen attacks on U-boats have been reported, eight of which were by shore-based aircraft, ten by surface craft and one by carrier-borne aircraft. four of the attacks were carried out in the Mediterranean. :On the 8th a Sunderland sank a U-boat in the Bay of Biscay; survivors were seen in the water. On the same day, in the S.W. Approaches, ships of an escortgroup, including three of H.M. Canadian corvettes, which were escorting a south-bound convoy, probably sank another. On the 11th aircraft from the U.S.S. BlockIsland (escort carrier) probably sank a U-boat N.E. of the Azores. H.M.ships Winchelsea (destroyer) and Abelia (corvette) possibly sank one on the 9th inthe S.W. Approaches. Two U-boats were possibly damaged by aircraft in the bay of Biscay.A promising attack by U.S. aircraft off the N.E. coast of New Guineaon the night of the 7th/8th has not yet been assessed.Enemy Intelligence.14. The morale of survivors from one of the Elbing class destroyers whichwere sunk on the 28th December has been found on examination to be poor.Since the naval repair base at Trondheim was heavily raided by aircraft last july, only one ship has been seen to arrive at the naval yard.The German s.s. Weserland (6,528 tons), which was sunk S.W. ofAscension Island on the 3rd, is reported to have sailed from Batavia on the 22ndNovember with a cargo of rubber, tin, resin, tungsten, and citronella and coconutoils. The other blockade runners sunk are believed to have been loaded with similar cargoes. The 133 prisoners captured from the Weserland consisted of six German naval officers, 32 German naval ratings, 12 officers and 46 ratings ofthe merchant marine, 35 Italians and two Finns.A merchant raider is reported to have been sunk about 400 miles fromYokohama in 1943. She originally left Germany in March 1942 and operatedthroughout the year in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean, sinking or cap-turing at least nine ships. In February 1943 she was at Batawia, and was probably in Japanese waters for overhaul, fuelling and stores.U-boats.15. There are probably about 20 U-boats scattered throughout the N.W.Approaches, and a group is patrolling between the Azores and Portugal. two-boats have recently entered the Mediterranean.Enemy Attack on Shipping.16. During the week one ship was torpedoed by a U-boat south of Ceylonbut was only slightly damaged. Two ships were torpedoed, one of which sank,in an eastbound convoy which was attacked by aircraft north-west of Oran.Another eastbound convoy was unsuccessfully attacked by aircraft north-west of tobruk. During these attacks five Ju. 88 were shot down, including one by naval A.A. fire, two others were probably destroyed and one damaged. One ship was mined and sunk in the Bay of Naples.17. Shipping losses by enemy action during December totalled 162,000 tons.Thirteen ships (87,155 tons) were sunk by U-boats, 15 ships (68,413 tons) by aircraft and one ship (6,086 tons) by mine. U-boats sank eight ships in the north atlantic, four in&quot;1 the Indian Ocean and one in the Mediterranean. All the losses by aircraft took place in the Mediterranean and included the heavy losses incurred in the raid on Bari. Marine risks accounted for 15,000 tons, making a total of177,000 tons lost during the month.[26719] b
18. An analysis of the annual losses into quarterly periods gives a clearpicture of the marked improvement in the situation which has taken place during1943 and is shown in Appendix II (C) and (D). The downward trend isparticularly noticeable for losses by U-boat, especially in the North Atlantic.19. Since the beginning of the war and up to the end of 1943, 4,404 ships(British, Allied and neutral), totalling 19^ million tons, have been sunk by enemy action. Of these 2,559 ships, totalling 13^ million tons, were sunk by U-boats;707 ships, totalling 2^ million tons, by aircraft; 459 ships, totalling 1 million tons,by mines; and 304 ships, totalling 1^ million tons, by surface craft.Protection of Seaborne Trade.20. During the week ending the 9th, 787 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 222 ships were in ocean convoys and 565 in British coastal convoys. One escort carrier, one anti-aircraft ship, 50 destroyers and 119 sloops,cutters, frigates and corvettes (including 13 US. destroyer escorts) were employedon escort duties. Seven homeward bound ocean convoys, consisting of154 ships, and three outward bound convoys, of 6S ships, arrived at their destinations without loss.21. During December, 22 ocean convoys of 626 ships arrived in the UnitedKingdom and 17 outward convoys of 542 ships reached their destinations without loss. One straggler was sunk from an outward bound convoy still at sea at theend of the month.In the Western Atlantic and Caribbean 1,617 ships, in 145 convoys, arrivedat their destinations without loss, and one convoy of 11 ships lost one beforearrival.Allied Minelaying.22. Aircraft laid mines off the Frisian Islands, the Dutch coast, the North coast of France, and the Biscay ports.In the Mediterranean aircraft laid mines off Rhodes and Salarnis.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.23. There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy aircraft duringthe week.   E-boats are suspected to have laid mines west of the Lizard.Twenty-four moored mines and one ground mine have been destroyed off theEast Coast during the week and the mine totals are: 4,617 ground and3,958 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.24. During the period 1st to 15th December three enemy ships totalling4,260 tons were sunk.The German s.s. Castembrut (6,000 tons) arrived at Bilbao on the 5th to load ore.The German (ex-French) s.s. Bacchus (1,810 tons) left Istanbul and entered the ^gean on the night of the 6th/7th; she had a cargo of 1,400 tons of dieseloil, the first large cargo of oil to go by sea since the middle of September.Two German ships arrived at Istanbul on the 8th in transit from the ^Egeanto the Black Sea.Italian Merchant Shipping.25. The Italian s.s. Gaeta (4,457 tons) has arrived at Gibraltar fromHuelva. .The Italian tankers Arcola (6,349 tons) and Taigete (4,672 tons), whichhave been in the Cape Verde Islands since April 1943, are to be handed over tothe Ministry of WTar Transport. They will sail under the Italian flag withItalian crews if possible.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.     (An outline map is included as an inset.)Nevel-Vitebsk Sector.26. Deep snow is hampering movement in this sector, but the Russians have maintained their pressure and have made slight progress N.W. of Nevel.
Central Sector.27. The Germans have repeatedly reported Russian attacks in the Mogilev-Zhlobin area, but no confirmation of these has come from the Russians.Kiev Sector.28. The Russian offensive in the Kiev sector, which was renewed on the24th December, has continued to make excellent progress. It has taken the formof four major thrusts : (a) To the west, where the Russians have now crossed the 1922-39 Polishfrontier oh a wide front and have occupied towns on the railway bothnorth and south of Sarny.   They have thus cut the last north-south- railway east of Brest-Litovsk.(b) To the S.W., where the Russians have advanced towards Shepetovkaand beyond Berdichev.(c) Towards Zhmerinka, which they have approached to a point within some12 miles S.E. of Vinnitsa.(d) To the S.E. from Fastov, where they have made good progress on bothsides of the railway Fastov-Smela.In less than three weeks, therefore, the Russians have advanced over 80 miles to the west and about the same distance to the S.W. and south. In the course ofthese operations they have extended their front in this sector from 150 to over300 miles. This has been done in spite of the fact that the ground remained softin many places until the 6th January, although since then reports of heavy frostsuggest that winter conditions are setting in.It is believed that in order to meet the threat in this sector the Germans have moved some of their armour from the Dnieper Bend.Dnieper Bend.29. On the 5th January the Russians launched a new offensive in theKirovograd area which was probably timed to coincide with the transfer ofGerman armour. They made rapid progress, claiming an advance of up to30 miles on a 75-mile front, during which they first encircled, and then captured,Kirovograd itself.Crimea. -       . .30. The Germans report a renewal of strong Russian attacks on the 10thfrom the bridgehead N.E. of Kerch, which they claim to have repulsed.General.31. While there is no sign that the German retreat in the Kiev and Dniepersectors has become a rout, the speed of the Russian advance must certainly have caused some disorganisation. The situation contains some very unpleasantpossibilities for the Germans. If the Russians cut the rail communications atZmerinka, the German forces in the Dnieper Bend would have only three routesleft for evacuation : two low-capacity railways into Rumania, and the port ofOdessa. They would probably then be compelled to withdraw gradually from theBend while covering the piecemeal evacuation of their forces. Even a furtherRussian success in the Kirovograd area would be a grave threat. It is clear thatthe German High Command must decide quickly whether to withdraw its forces from the Dnieper Bend. It would no doubt be loth to do this, but an attempt tohold the positions there might well lead to another &quot; Stalingrad.&quot;Italy.Eighth Army.32. In the Adriatic coastal sector the course of the fighting during the past week has been largely determined by the very wintry weather conditions whichhave prevailed. \ As a result, there has been no material change in the. EighthArcny^ forward positions in this area. Canadian and Indian troops have main-tained patrol activity and have dealt successfully with similar activity on the part,of the enemy. Inland, New Zealand troops have had exchanges of artillery andmortar fire in the Orsogna area.[26719] &apos;       . b 2
For some weeks now there has been little activity on the left flank of the eighth Army where our positions lie along the banks of the Sangro as far asAlfedena. This section of the front is comparatively lightly held by both sidessince the mountains preclude the deployment of large forces. Recent heavysnowfalls have caused supply difficulties to our troops, and in some areas, wherethe roads had become completely blocked by snowdrifts, supplies had to be dropped from the air.Although the snow conditions have undoubtedly caused the enemy similarsupply difficulties, he has been able to carry out certain regroupings of his forces and to prepare further defensive positions. So long as he can block anyEighth Army threat to Rome he can make dispositions in the Adriatic sectorindependently of those facing the Fifth Army, since the Apennines form a Jdividing barrier between the two battles. It now appears that the next mainenemy defensive position will be along the river Saline, north of Pescara, andthat he will continue to fight delaying actions based on his intermediate positionsbetween his present position and that river.Fifth Army.33. On the right flank of the Fifth Army the French, after a week&apos;sinactivity imposed by bad weather, returned to the attack on the 12th and immediately made some progress towards Gardito.In the central sector U.S. troops took San Vittore on the 7th, after two days&apos;bitter street fighting, and pressed their attack towards Cervaro. By the 12ththey had gained possession of the hills to the north and south of the town.A similar advance has also been made to the south of Cervaro along the main road and railway that run towards Cassino. British infantry are participating in the latter advance and have cleared one of the two remaining hills that lie between us and the more open southern approaches to Cassino. The enemycontinues to offer dogged resistance, fighting in small groups in well dug-inpositions with a high allotment of automatic weapons. U.S. troops took Cervaroon the 12th.There has been active patrolling along the Garigliano and some small enemypockets on the south bank have been successfully liquidated.&apos;Yugoslavia.34. Five German columns are converging on Partisan-held territory in central Bosnia from the north, east and S.E. One of these columns, which brokethrough from BanjaJuka in the north, was supported by 40 tanks. heavy fighting is in progress at Mrkonjugrad (30 miles south of Banjaluka).The Partisan raiding force which recently penetrated into Banjalukawithdrew after inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy (800 killed, 650 captured,300 wounded).A German attempt to land on the island&apos; of Hvar on the 5th was frustratedby bad weather. The Germans have shelled the eastern end of Hvar fromthe coast.Greece.-Operations against the Enemy.35. E.L.A.S. successfully resisted a heavy German drive from Lamia west-wards into Roumeli. Another German drive was reported to have started in theEdessa area (50 miles west of Salonika) early this month.Civil War.36.   Early this month Zervas advanced eastwards across the Yanina-Artaroad some 10 miles into E.L.A.S-held positions, capturing a number of villages. jBurma.37. In the Arakan our troops, continuing their pressure against Japanesepositions in the Mayu Peninsula, have occupied a village two miles N.E. ofMaungdaw, and have forward elements in Maungdaw itself and near the roadleading eastwards to Buthidaung.Chinese troops in the Hukawng Valley are mopping up Japanese pocketsin the Yupbang area (25 miles S.E. of Shingbwiyang), and are in contact withthe Japanese further to the south.
Pacific Theatre.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)New Guinea.38. The landing at Saidor (on the New Guinea coast about 15 miles .W. of Finschhafen) achieved complete surprise. The harbour and the air-field were captured on the first day and there has been little enemy oppositionat any stage. The U.S. forces which carried out the landing are now holding-defensive positions on a perimeter running from a point on the coast about four miles west of Saidor to a point on the coast about nine miles S.E. of Saidor.The Australian forces from Finschhafen have advanced about 15 miles along the coast during the last week, and are now about 75 miles from Saidor. Theyhave only come into contact with small enemy parties. Japanese barge move-ments suggest that Japanese troops in the area between the U.S. and Australianforces may be withdrawing by sea towards their main base at Madang.New Britain.39. The U.S. Marines who captured Cape Gloucester on the 30th Decemberhave extended their perimeter both westward, towards Tauali, where the subsidiary landing took place, and southward towards Borgen Bay. Patrolsfrom the main and subsidiary landing forces made contact about the 5th January.On the 4th the Japanese made an unsuccessful counter-attack inthe Borgen Bay sector which was repulsed with heavy casualties. Since thenU.S. Marines have made small alvances but in general there has been patrolactivity only. A report received oil the 13th states that a Japanese attempt toland on Cape Gloucester was frustrated by U.S. artillery, and a number of bargesladen with troops were sunk. Japanese casualties since the original landingnow total about 2,000.At Atawe there has been patrol activity only.Solomons.40. Further Allied reinforcements have landed in Bougainville. Therehas been an increase in Allied long-range patrolling. One such patrol haspenetrated to the east coast of the island, in the area of Numa Numa, about40 miles north of Kieta.AIR SITUATION.General Review.41. U.S. heavy bombers made daylight attacks on Ludwigshafen and on aircraft factories near Magdeburg and Brunswick.No large-scale night operations were undertaken by Bomber Command owingto unfavourable weather.In Italy, heavy attacks were made on Pola and Reggio Emelia. railway centres and lines of communicau ions were bombed.Fortresses and Wellingtons carried out successful raids on Sofia.Heavy attacks were made on enemy targets in New Britain and New Guinea.United Kingdom.42.   No enemy aircraft were reported over this country during the week.Home Waters.43. Typhoons damaged a 400-ton coaster off Brest and a Beaufighterdamaged another off Borkum.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 67 were despatched, laid 164 sea-mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.44. On the 7th, 382 Fortresses and 120 Liberators were despatched to attackLudwigshafem. Four hundred and fourteen aircraft attacked the target throughthick cloud, dropping 901 tons with results which are believed to be good.On the 11th, 529 Fortresses and 134 Liberators were despatched to bombtargets in North-West Germany.   A total of 257 Fortresses attacked the fighter
assembly factory at Oschersleben (near Magdeburg), the bomber aircraft com-components factory at Halberstadt (near Madgeburg) and the bomber aircraftcomponents factory at Waggum, near Brunswick, dropping a total of 503 tonsin clear weather. Photographs taken during the attacks show that atQschersleben the factory was well covered by a heavy concentration of bombs, atFfalberstadt two of the six main workshops received many direct hits, and atWaggum 130 bombs fell in highly concentrated groups within the target area.Of the remaining aircraft, 228 Fortresses and 66 Liberators dropped about600 tons on other targets in North-West Germany. -In the above attacks fighters (which flew 1,333 sorties) and bombers destroyed196 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 63, and damaged 74, for the loss of62 Fortresses, nine Liberators, and 12 fighters.On six days a total of 904 aircraft of the Allied Expeditionary Air force was despatched to attack military objectives in Northern France but, owing tounfavourable weather conditions, only 354 attacked the primary targets,dropping 219 tons of bombs and firing 116 rocket projectiles writh varied results.Of the remaining aircraft, about 60 attacked other objectives, including theCherbourg/Maupertus airfield, on which 50 tons of bombs were dropped withfairly good results. In these attacks, in connection with which 1,665 fightersorties were flown, six enemy aircraft were destroyed, one probably destroyed,and five damaged; 14 Allied fighter-bombers and fighters are missing.Night.45. Owing to adverse weather conditions over home bases, no large-scale operations were undertaken by Bomber Command.Small-scale attacks were made on Berlin and towns in North-West Germanyand on airfields and other targets in France and Belgium by a total of 104Mosquitoes of Bomber Command and the Allied Expeditionary Air Force.Leaflets were dropped on towns in France and Belgium by 44 aircraft of bomber command.   Two Mosquitoes are missing.Italy.46. Fighters and fighter-bombers were very active in the battle area andalso attacked lines of communication and military targets in the rear of theenemy&apos;s positions. Concentrated attacks were made on enemy strong points andgun positions in the area of San Martino in the East and Cervaro/Cassino in thewest; near Eoccaraso (40 miles E.N.E. of Frosinone) war hawks and Spitfiresattacked enemy tanks, obtaining a direct hit on one and probably damaging sevenothers. Other Allied fighter-bombers made deeper penetrations and bombed and machine-gunned M.T., locomotives and rolling stock, particularly in the coastal areas in the east, the Aquila/Popoli/Sulmona area in the centre, and the vicinity of Aquino/Rome/Civitavecchia in the west. Shipping was attacked at PortoClementino (48 miles N.W. of Rome), Imperia (60 miles S.W. of Genoa) .and west of Piombino (45 miles S.S.E. of Leghorn). Mosquito intruders operated inthe Po valley and also shot down two enemy bombers near Toulouse (S. France).In the course of these operations 32 locomotives, 113 wagons, two electric trains,266 M.T. vehicles and seven F-boats or small craft, were destroyed or damaged.Mitchells and Marauders continued their attacks on enemy railway centres.The raids were carried out by formations of between 20 and 30 aircraft; good results were obtained and the targets bombed included Lucca, Pistola, Pontedera,Foligno, Arezzo, Ancona, San Benedetto, Grosseto and Falconara. At Bucine(13 miles W. of Arezzo) hits were obtained on the north viaduct, the road bridgeat Roccasecca (18 miles S.E. of Frosinone) was hit, and Invaders bombed thetunnel entrance at Terracina (60 miles W.N.W. of Naples). The airfield atPerugia (82 miles N. of Rome) was bombed by 48 Mitchells, resulting in twohangars being set on fire and eight aircraft destroyed on the ground. Villanovaairfield was attacked by 34 Wellingtons, and a number of hits were observed onhangars and at least five grounded aircraft reported to be on fire.Twenty-three Wellingtons and 109 Fortresses bombed Reggio Emelia (70 miles .N.W. of Florence); extensive damage was caused to the Reggiane aircraft factory, to the airfield, and to railway tracks and rolling stock. Fortresses dropped288 tons of bombs at Pola Harbour with excellent results and 21 Fortresses bombedFiume.In the course of operations over Italy six enemy aircraft were destroyed and11 Allied aircraft are missing.
Yugoslavia.47. Sixty-nine Fortresses, part of a large force which was unable to attackWiener Neustadt, bombed Maribor (52 miles N.N.W. of Zagreb) and obtainedmany hits on an aircraft factory. Skoplje railway centre was attacked by 35Liberators, causing extensive damage and rendering the yards unserviceable.Forty-eight Mitchells carried out a successful raid on the dock area and railway centre at Metkovic, the target being well covered. The airfield at Mostar was bombed, a hangar was set on fire, and two aircraft on the ground were destroyed.Fighter-bombers flew offensive reconnaissances against shipping off the dalmatian Coast; four schooners, two barges, and four small craft were destroyed,[ one ship at Split was hit, and a large M.T.B. was damaged. At Ploco (60 miles.E. of Split), gun positions and the harbour installations were attacked.Bulgaria and Greece.48. Sofia was attacked by 143 Fortresses escorted by fighters. The raid was very successful and several hundred hits were reported through the city;the administration buildings in the centre of the city were on fire and barrackswere seriously damaged. The railway centre was bombed by 44 Wellingtons.Four bombers and two fighters are missing.piraeus harbour was attacked by 72 Fortresses, resulting in several fires.About 30/40 enemy fighters intercepted the raid, eight of which were shot down;eight Fortresses and two Lightnings are missingRussia.49. Over the front as a whole operations continue to be impeded by adverse weather conditions.Towards the end of the week, in the course of close-support operations for theRussian advance towards Vinnitsa, the Russian Air Force attacked enemy positions and lines of communications and is stated to have destroyed 150 M.T.,ten locomotives, and 60 trucks.In the Vitebsk-Nevel area it is considered that the Russian Air Force have continued in the face of bad weather to carry out effective operations against german front-line troops with strong forces of ground-attack and fighter aircraft.During the past week the G.A.F. operated both in the Kirovograd area andfurther north, in the Zhitomir salient, in an attempt to stem the Russian advanceeast of Vinnitsa. .Many factors are thought to explain the failure of the GAP. to exert decisiveinfluence on the course of the fighting in South Russia, in spite of the fact thatthey are estimated to have some 1,200 aircraft of all types available on the SouthRussian front. In the first place, they are no doubt experiencing the usualdifficulty of keeping their airfields serviceable under winter conditions. Further-more, with many of the supply lines from Germany to South Russia cut, they maybe hampered by shortages of various sorts. As in previous crises, some proportionof their long-range bomber force has probably been diverted to supply tasks. Itis also evident that, as a result of constant, enforced retreats, ground staffs willhave been kept fully occupied with moves to new bases, while frequent movementof units from one sector to another has probably impaired their operational efficiency. It is probable that serviceability, under present conditions, is lessthan 50 per cent, of the total force available, and it may be even lower.Burma and Siam.50. Allied aircraft attacked road, rail and river communications inr different parts of the country. Four-locomotives, about 40 units of rolling-stock,^ and many M.T. vehicles were destroyed or damaged. In Upper Burma a railway bridge is believed to have been destroyed and another damaged. On theIrrawaddy and other rivers, six sampans were sunk and about 70 sampans andother rivercraft were damaged. .Oil installations at Chauk were attacked by seven escorted Mitchells;buildings, workshops, and large storage cisterns were hit and fires were started.Akyab airfield; was twice attacked by a total of 14 Flurricanes. three enemy aircraft being damaged on the ground. :Daily attacks were made on enemy positions, supply dumps and camps.Sea-mines were laid in the Rangoon and Salween Rivers and in the Menam Rivernear Bangkok, and supplies were dropped for Allied troops in the Chin Hillsand Upper Burma.
China.51. Mitchells and fighters attacked shipping on the Yangtze River; atroopship, three small ships and about 50 small craft were sunk, three small ships were set on fire and six steam-boats and many small craft were damaged. A smallship was sunk off Swatow.Pacific Zone.New Britain.52. The enemy airfields at Rapopo, Vunakanau, Lakunai, Borpop andTobera were heavily bombed throughout the week. During an attack on Toberaby 39 escorted naval bombers, 16 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat for theloss of one naval bomber and three fighters. Attacks were also made on artillerypositions and other targets in the Borgen Bay and Arawe areas. At Keravat,a torpedo dump was successfully bombed.Off Rabaul a Catalina obtained a bomb hit on a submarine-chaser, andCorsairs attacked two troop-laden barges, sinking one and setting the otheron fire.Enemy aircraft made several attacks on Allied positions, especially in theArawe area, but they were generally ineffective. In two encounters with enemy fighters over Rabaul, Allied fighters destroyed 19 and probably destroyed ninefor the loss of three.New Guinea.53. Liberators, Mitchells and Marauders made heavy attacks on gun positions, stores and barge concentrations in the Alexishafen, Madang, Sio andSaidor areas. In the Alexishafen area alone nearly 420 tons of bombs were dropped-with good results. In the Bogadyim area, heavy attacks were made ona barge base, gun positions, supply dumps, and roads, several bridges being destroyed or damaged.Successful attacks were also made on enemy shipping. A 5,000-ton tanker,one small ship, and five barges were sunk, a small ship was set on fire, and two small ships and four barges were damaged. Eight troop-laden barges enteringSarang Harbour (30 miles N.W. of Madang) were machine-gunned, many casualties being caused..A few enemy aircraft ineffectively attacked Allied positions in theSaidor area.New Ireland.54. Forty-two escorted light naval bombers attacked enemy gun positions and a radar station at Cape St. George. Of about 60 enemy fighters encountered,12 were destroyed and two probably destroyed for the.loss of three Allied fighters.Two Catalinas bombed Panapai airfield and Kavieng, starting several fires.A tug was sunk off Kavieng and a destroyer was damaged off the west coast.Bougainville.55. Heavy and medium bombers attacked enemy supply dumps, gun positions and other targets in the Kahili, Tonolei, Chabai and Shortland Islandareas, and naval light bombers attacked bridges and camps in the EmpressAugusta Bay area. A bridge was partially destroyed on the Buin-Mawaretaroad.In the Buka Passage two barges were damaged and three water-borne float-planes destroyed.Marshall and Gilbert Islands.56. In the Marshalls, Liberators and Mitchells attacked targets on Wotje,Arno, Jaluit, Milli and Taroa Islands, dropping about 150 tons of bombs.During attacks on Wotje and Arno, a total of about 60 enemy fighters attempted to intercept, but ten were destroyed and seven were probably destroyed without loss. Venturas attacked two medium-sized ships and obtained two direct hits on one of them.In the Gilberts, a total of 18 enemy aircraft made two attacks on Apamamaairfield, destroying one Liberator and damaging two others.

19114APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Berlin.- Photographs were obtained of parts of the city on the 4th january and these were, owing to weather conditions, of rather poor quality and largelycloud covered. Furthermore, a light mantle of snow made interpretation difficult.It could be seen, however, that two priority 1 works, both in the south-easterndistrict of Johannistal, have suffered serious damage. They are the Henschelaircraft assembly and repair works and the ambitious-Budd armament works.Severe damage to less important industry and to business and residential property can also be seen.A final interpretation of photographs covering attacks up to the 16th-l7thDecember confirms that, even by that date, damage was already widespread andsevere. Cover of the whole area is not complete, and scale and shadow prevent any real detailed assessment. The main features of interest not already reportedare :  (i) 17 per cent, of the buildings in the fully built-up and 50 to 70 per cent.built-up areas of the city have been destroyed,(ii) The area in which the greatest havoc is seen stretches from the east sideof the central district to Charlottenburg in the north-west andWilmersdorf in the south-west, covering an area of nearly 8 square miles.(iii) The important industrial districts of Reinickendorf and Spandau are almost as severely damaged.(iv) Three priority 14-  and eight priority 1 targets have been severely damaged.Kiel.- Photographs show that as a result of the .U.S.A.A.F. attack on the13th December an M/V (about 210 feet) opposite South yard quay on the westbank of fjord and a torpedo-boat in the inner dockyard basin were sunk.France.Paris. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 31st December on targets in the Ivry area shows severeindustrial damage. In the C.A.M. ballbearing works the cage machine shops,the ball manufacturing shops, and the finishing and assembly section, have allsustained damage (the last named suffering severely), while one bay of the mainbuilding has been almost destroyed.Other factories which have been heavily damaged are the electric bulbworks of Cie. des Lampes and the forging and stamping works of Etabs.Lemoine. Several small unidentified factories have also been severely hit and nearly every building in the oil storage depot of Desmarais has been destroyed or severely damaged.Bordeatox-Merignac. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack, onthe 5th January, are of small scale and this necessarily means that the immediateinterpretation is of a conservative nature. It can be seen, however, that two large hangars on the north-west boundary, one housing the Bloch workshop and the other used by Focke-Wulfe, have been partly destroyed. On the southboundary, one large building has been hit, another probably hit, and a smallbuilding damaged, while on the south-west boundary a large hangar has a holein the roof. There are a large number of craters on the landing ground andsome on the north-east/ south-west runway.Cognac-Chateattbernard. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attackon the 31st December show severe damage to this airfield. All the hangars havebeen hit and eight out of the nine destroyed or severely damaged. Several smallerbuildings (workshops, stores and barrack type buildings) have also been destroyed or damaged, the airfield buildings behind the northern hangars in particular[26719] &apos; d
having suffered considerably. There are heavy concentrations of craters on the landing ground, as well as a number of hits on the perimeter track, the servicingtarmacs and the west runway.Landes de Bussac. Photographs show that as a result of the U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 31st December one large hangar has been damaged and a &quot; T&quot;aircraft shelter severely damaged. Among the barrack buildings four mediumhuts and one small hut have been destroyed, and another four medium hutsdamaged.St. Jean D&apos;Angely. Interpretation of photographs taken on the 5th Januaryafter the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 31st December snows that severe damage was caused in the hangar and barracks area west of the airfield. One of the three largedouble hangars was wrecked and another damaged while three smaller buildings(one of them the station headquarters building) and nine barracks huts were destroyed or damaged. To the north of the west hangars there is a large ooncen -tration of craters across the landing ground.Tours-Par cay-Me slay\ Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 5th January show that heavy damage has been caused, chiefly in the west and north hangar areas. At least two large double hangars have been hit and fourworkshops and many stores buildings and sheds destroyed or damaged. Eight ornine aircraft shelters have received varying &quot;degrees of damage and there areapproximately 180 craters spread across the landing ground from the west to thenorth.
