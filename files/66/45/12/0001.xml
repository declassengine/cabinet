this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 12.7th January, 1944.WAR CABINET.MEETING WITH DOMINION PRIME MINISTERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IT can now safely be assumed, in the absence of some unexpected develop-ment, that the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and SouthAfrica will arrive in the first week of May for the proposed meeting. I attach the latest messages from the Prime Ministers on the subject (Appendices 1, 2, 3, 4).It seems desirable to make clear at the outset that this meeting is intendedto be a meeting of Prime Ministers and not a full Imperial Conference on thepeace-time scale involving large delegations and an elaborate agenda anddocumentation.At the same time, General Smuts has suggested that it would be helpful ifany documents which it is intended to consider at the meeting should, if possible,be made available for study by the Prime Ministers before they leave theirrespective Dominions.The discussions will no doubt cover in the main the immediate militarysituation, questions arising from the probable two-stage ending of the war,outlines of the post-war settlement and co-operation within the British Common-wealth after the war. There would also be certain special subjects within theabove framework, e.g., -Colonial policy (with reference to regional organisation,e.g:, in the Pacific), civil aviation policy, and Empire migration.In the light of General Smuts&apos;s suggestion referred to above, I think that consideration should now be given to the question whether it is desirable that and preliminary memoranda should be prepared. I should be glad of the views of mycolleagues as to this. It may be felt to be difficult and perhaps inadvisable toattempt to deal with the major issues by means of memoranda sent out in advance,but my colleagues will no doubt consider whether there are any questions whichcan usefully be dealt with in this way. There is also the question of what briefsshould be prepared for the assistance of United Kingdom Ministers at themeeting. For instance, within the immediate Dominions Office sphere, I thinkit would clearly be useful to have briefs on (a) migration and (b) the question of closer co-operation within the Commonwealth after the war (which would cover the suggestions which Mr. Curtin is likely to put forward). 1 will have theseprepared in the Dominions Office and circulated later.As indicated above, the meeting is not a full Imperial Conference, but ameeting of the United Kingdom and Dominion Prime Ministers. The feeling ofthe Cabinet, when the matter was previously discussed, was that this fact would preclude direct Indian representation, though arrangements should be made forthe Indian Representatives at the War Cabinet to be available in London so thatthey could take part in any discussions on special subjects affecting India. Forthe same reason, I consider that no invitation should be sent to the Prime Ministerof Southern Rhodesia and that the representation of Burma would also be inappropriate. The Secretary of State for the Colonies would no doubt beavailable for any discussion on Colonial questions.C.Dominions Office, 7th January, 1944.[26694]
