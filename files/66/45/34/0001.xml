THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 34.16th January, 1944.WAR CABINET.ARGENTINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN W.P. (44) 21 of the 13th January, I explained the reasons for which Iwas appealing to the United States Secretary of State to defer certain action he was contemplating as regards Argentina (denunciatory statement, economic sanctions, and withdrawal of the United States Ambassador from Buenos Aires)until I had had time to examine the matter in all its implications, and until theviews of the Combined Boards in Washington as to the effect on the war effort ofthe adoption of the proposals had been ascertained. As my colleagues will have noted, Mr. Hull has replied that he is deferring to my wishes and taking no action in this matter until my views have been made known. He would, however,like immediately and simultaneously (1) to issue the general statement of which a copy is annexed;(2) to impose a general freezing of Argentine assets, to place Argentina ona footing with European neutrals;(3) to withdraw the United States Ambassador from Buenos Aires, and he suggests that parallel action should be taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on (1) and (3), accompanied by a declaration that weapprove the political purpose Underlying American action on (2).He adds that any other steps leading to sanctions should wait on theconsideration of the findings of the Combined Boards.2. It appears to me that to take such immediate action as Mr. Hull desireswould be &quot;to prejudge the decision on the report which the Combined boards have been asked to make. Moreover, as my colleagues are aware, I am inclined to doubt the efficacy or advantage of Mr. hull&apos;s - proposals (a view whichincidentally is shared by Sir David Kelly, his Canadian colleague, the Secretary-General of the Brazilian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and even by the UnitedStates Ambassador at Buenos Aires himself). It was for this reason that Idirected my efforts to postponing action on Mr.-hull&apos;s  part in the hope that american official opposition (which includes, e.g., Mr. McCloy, assistant secretary of the War Department) to his proposals might crystallise, and that he might be deflected from his purpose. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Hull seemsdetermined to proceed, and since he has already, to some extent, committedhimself, by statements to the American press, to some sort of action againstArgentina with which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be associated, we must take into account the disadvantages of public divergence in a matter of this kindbetween the Americans and ourselves. I therefore circulate to my colleagues here-with the draft of a telegram which I would propose, if they agree, to send toLord Halifax on this subject, suggesting a last appeal to reason and indicating the extent to which, if this fails, we can go to meet Mr. hull&apos;s  wishes.3. Lord Halifax&apos;s own advice is that we should meet Mr. Hull as far aspossible, in view&quot;of the latter&apos;s anxieties and the possible misinterpretation ofour attitude at Washington.A. E.Foreign Office,16th January, 1944.[26736]Copy No.
ANNEX.Draft Telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington.&quot;    Your telegrams&apos;185 and 187 [of 14th January : Argentina].Cabinet have now considered proposals in your telegram 185 with everywish to go as far as possible in step with United States Government, even ifthis should involve acting to some extent against our own judgment and bakingcertain risks.Following are our observations : Our object in proposing consultation of combined Boards was to enable United States Government and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to estimate risks to supply position and war effort of anycondemnatory or punitive action against Argentina. Mr. Hull desires to takecertain steps immediately in advance of report from Combined Boards.This must inevitably in our view entail some risks and to some extent prejudgedecisions to be taken as result of Board&apos;s enquiry. (See New York Times of15th January regarding Argentina.) It is in any case starting down a path-by which we cannot see end but which might lead either to divergence between us, which could hardly be concealed and which might be most damaging in latin america, or to steps detrimental to the war effort in this crucial year. We wonderwhether Mr. Hull has taken this into account?The three preliminary steps he proposes are, we assume, intended primarilyas a gesture, and are not expected to produce any major effect in Argentine itself,but rather to serve as a warning and a deterrent to other South American countries from following the Argentine example. We fear, however, that such a statementmight arouse sympathy for Argentina in other Latin American countries andcontribute to fortify the Argentine Governments internal position, which wouldbe most undesirable both in itself and because it might encourage the argentine government to further defiance and even to take action damaging to the war effort. We presume that the United States Government have consulted otherAmerican Governments, including especially Brazil, as to advantages of action proposed.I should be glad if you will put these considerations in person to Mr. Hullas sympathetically as you are able, assuring him of my earnest wish to do allin my power to help him and to further our mutual interests and those of theUnited Nations, adding any other arguments from my previous telegrams which appear to you likely to seem convincing to him.If you are unable to move him from his wish to act in advance of receipt ofthe report of Combined Boards, you should suggest to him that, before agreeing tohis preliminary steps with their possible consequences, it would be most useful ifthese could be jointly discussed with one or two of his Latin American colleagues(including, of course, Brazil) and perhaps with representative of Canada, whichwould be vitally concerned in supply issue. . Would he agree to very confidentialexchange of views of this kind.? If he agrees, you are authorised to take partin it. It would be restricted to examination of general situation in SouthAmerica and to the three preliminary steps. If Mr. Hull is still not preparedto agree, in the interest of Anglo-United States solidarity we should be preparedto make a statement of our own to synchronise with that which he desires tomake. We should be prepared to include in this statement a passage to theeffect that we entirely appreciate the political considerations which have movedthe United States Government to freezing Argentine assets, mentioning that ourown controls, though different in form, are similar in effect.Recall of Ambassadors, on the other hand, even if only ostensibly for consul-tation, is a step which seems to us likely to occasion greater embarrassment and inconvenience to United States Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government than to the Argentines. Its effect, would not be great unless at least all latin american Heads of Missions were withdrawn simultaneously. We hope,therefore, that Mr. Hull will not press this proposal now and that if he deems it essential to pursue it, the matter might be left over for consideration until afterthe Combined Boards have reported.
