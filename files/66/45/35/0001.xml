This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government    , *P*Printed for the War Cabinet, January, 1944 148SECRETCopy - No.W.P. (44) 3518th January, 1944.WAR CABINETTHE PROTECTION OF MONUMENTS AND WORKS OF ARTMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. In connection with the paper circulated by the Deputy Prime Minister (W.P. (44) 14),my colleagues will wish to have some account of what has been done and is being done forthe protection of monuments and works of art in territories entered by our forces.2. The Army, in the face of the enemy, is concerned with his destruction to the exclusion of all other considerations, ft will not exercise any nice discrimination in the selection of itstargets, since the enemy would be quick to take advantage of the sanctuary offered by anysuch doctrine.3. Immediately behind the advancing armies the situation is different. But here, too,the prime object of the military staff proper and of the civil administration staff attachedto it is to facilitate military operations by attending to certain necessities, of which the safeguarding of objects of historical interest is not one.4. Nevertheless, the signatories of the memorandum attached to the Prime Ministerspaper are not alone in their anxiety that everything reasonably possible should be ,done tosecure the safety of objects having an international, rather than a local, significance in thehistory of civilisation. The British forces in the held represent a fair cross-section of theBritish public at large, and may be presumed to have at heart the same interests as thedistinguished representatives of fine arts, etc., who have written to the Deputy PrimeMinister and have been represented on the deputation to which he refers. -.&apos;5. Before the invasion of Sicily, viz., in April, 1943, the War Office initiated action forconserving the art monuments of Italy. General routine orders were issued, both to thefighting staffs and to the civil affairs officers, and, as part of the organization of the joint anglo-American civil administration of the Island, one of the responsibilities imposed uponthe Military Government was that of doing what might be practicable in this direction. i must here observe that the invasion of Sicily, as in the case of all seaborne operations, was con-ditioned and limited in its extent by the availability of shipping, and this limitation coveredboth the provision of personnel and of equipment, particularly vehicles. It followed,therefore, that the preparations for military non-essentials had to be restricted by force of circumstances to the barest minimum, and it was physically impossible to provide eventhe more essential services with the necessary transport and personnel. Thus theless essential services, of which art preservation was one, suffered in the opening stages.This restriction was even more evident in the battles which culminated in the clearance of the north coast of Africa. It is easy to appreciate that in the advance fromEl Alamein the preservation of historical antiquities would not be foremost in the minds ofcommanders, staff or troops.6. On the American side the initiative was taken by various learned bodies, and inAugust, 1943, a special Commission was appointed by the President of the United states which sent out a body of officer experts (supplemented from British sources) and furnisheddirectives for their activities. These directives, which were approved jointly by the twoGovernments, anticipated all the recommendations quoted by the Deputy Prime Minister asmade to him by the Parliamentary deputation on the 12th November.7. Despite the powerful constitution of the American Commission and the orderspublished by formation commanders, the steps taken were not fully effective, and on the1st of November I appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Leonard Woolley to be - ArchaeologicalAdvisor to the Directorate of Civil Affairs and ordered him, at the earliest possible moment, to visit Italy and Sicily and to carry out a personal investigation.8. Sir Leonard Woolley found that while the staff of officer experts was admirablyequipped for its purpose, they were not distributed to the areas where they were most needed ; in so far as they were distributed they had lost touch with the centre of their ownorganization ; and they lacked the authority necessary for the effective performance oftheir duties.9. The organization, therefore, was not working as it should, and although it is anexaggeration to speak of &quot; much &quot; avoidable damage and loss having occurred, there is nodoubt that there were abuses and that some opportunities of salving monuments werelet slip.
2io. The organization was accordingly re-modelled, and under the new arrangement someof the officer experts are attached to the fighting commands, and in rear of the battle areaothers are available for posting wherever required. Moreover, the officers now enjoy an authority which formerly they did not possess.ii. On the conclusion of his tour the Archaeological Adviser reported to A.F.H.Q.,Algiers, and as a result of his specific recommendations General Eisenhower issued a general order, which I give in the annexure to this paper.12. Turning now to the details of the memorandum, I do not really follow what the signatories mean when in paragraph i they say that they feel that such work should form part of a larger scheme and not be confined to a supplementary part of one branch of theService. It is clear that this form of activity can only prosper if it is brought under thedirection of the Allied Military Government or of the Allied Commission of Control, as thecase may be. In either event the joint responsibility is, so far as the British Army is con-cerned, with the War Office, and the Department must be a branch of the War Office machine.I regard the appointment of Sir Leonard Woolley as the Adviser to the Directorate of civil affairs as being a wholly satisfactory arrangement. The experience we have gained in north africa and in Italy should stand us in good stead in the forthcoming operations on theContinent; an organization based on that which I have sketched in the immediately preceding paragraphs will function from the start of these operations.13. I have referred briefly to the position of the Army as regards the restriction of targets. This part of the memorandum, is, I think, mainly for the Secretary of Statefor Air.14. On the third point in the memorandum, I am wholly in agreement. The post-warproblem of restitution, or of compensation for works of art stolen or wantonly destroyedby the enemy lies outside the scope of the fighting services. I heartily agree, therefore, thata special Commission ought to be formed for this specific purpose. The need of it has beenforeseen and to some extent the way has been prepared for it. This is not to say that theArmy staff cannot do much valuable work in the way of collecting evidence of German theftand destruction, evidence which would be a basis for the Restitution: Commission^judgment. Some of these officers, no doubt, might well be chosen to serve on the Commission,to which their experience would be of great value. And apart from the serving officers,Sir Leonard Woolley is already enlisting in this country a panel of authorities on the finearts whose advice may be called for now in cases of special difficulty, and some of whom will undoubtedly figure on any Commission which may be appointed.15. I do not, however, think that a Commission, as such, could usefully deal with thepractical problems that confront the Army in the field, once the right machinery has been evolved, and I believe that it has now been evolved. The rest is largely a matter ofmilitary discipline. The mistakes which have occurred tend to show how impossible it isfor an external civilian body even one as powerful as the United States Commission tocontrol events within the province of the Commander-in-Chief. Such a body can, in myopinion, act only in an advisory capacity. But of the need for the Restitution Committee Iam convinced, and I think it most desirable that it should be organized in advance.P. J. G.The War Office,x8th January, 1944.ANNEX TO W.P.J44) 35.Historical Monuments1. Buildings.(a) No building listed in the&apos;sections &quot; Works of ART &quot; in the &quot; Zone Hand-Books &quot; ofITALY issued by the Political Warfare Executive to all Allied Military Government officers will be used for military purposes without the explicit permission of the Allied Commander-in-Chief or of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, 15th Army Group in each individual case.(6) Commanders concerned are authorised, as a further measure of security, to close and put out of bounds for troops any of the buildings listed in AMG &quot; Zone Hand-Book &quot; thatthey deem necessary. Notices to that effect will be affixed to the buildings, and guardsprovided to enforce them if necessary.(c) Allied Military Government officers are prepared to furnish commanders with a listof historical buildings other than those listed in the AMG &quot;Zone Hand-Book.&quot; these buildings are of secondary importance and may be used for military purposes when deemed necessary. Commanders are reminded that buildings containing art collections, scientificobjects, or those which when used would offend the religious susceptibilities of the people,should not be occupied when alternative accommodations are available.2. Looting, Wanton Damage and Sacrilege.The prevention of looting, wanton damage and sacrilege of buildings is a commandresponsibility.   The seriousness of such an offence will be explained to all Allied personnel.By command of General EISENHOWER.(b43/181)    80   1/44   w.o.p.   16424
