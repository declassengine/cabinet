(44) 13---  - v^AR   CABINET11 th - January1 944Special Requirements of Labour, Equipment andMaterial for Invasion Operations.(Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Aircraft production.)In ff.P. (44)2 the Ministers of Labour and National Service and ofProduction make proposals for meeting the special needs of labour, equipment and materials during the launching of the assault on Europe and the period immediately prior thereto.      In paragraph 2 of that xJaPe^ they give instances of typical services which may qualify for the special measures they suggest.No mention is made of aircraft.2..    Aircraft will be a vital factor in these operations and may be the vital factor.      They.will be required for the protection of the invasionshipping and of the ground forces, and for the dislocation of the enemy&apos;sdefences, transport, etc.      The salvage of damaged aircraft (we use the word&quot;aircraft&quot; throughout this memorandum to cover engines, propellers, armament,equipment and spares, etc,) and the repair of aircraft must therefore rankat least equal &apos;in importance to the services mentioned, in paragraph 2 of w.P.(44)2, while the new production of those types of aircraft which havea direct part to play in the operations must at least be protected from the diversion of materials, equipment and labour contemplated in paragraph 5.3,      Similar considerations apply to the repair of airfields, which may be under heavy attack.      It is intended that this work should be carried outpartly by Service-manned Airfield Construction Squadrons and partly by the civilian-manned &quot;works Repair Depot organisation and contractors maintenancelabour.4.      We therefore ask the Cabinet to attach the following conditions totheir approval of the proposals in W.P,(44)2 :-(i)   The salvage and repair of aircraft shall be included among&apos; theservices that will, if necessary, receive assistance under thearrangement s.(ii)   Production of Lancasters, Halifaxes, Spitfires, Mosquitos, Typhoons,Tempests and all the spares for these types shell be exempted from making contributions under the proposals.(iii)    Any contributions that it may be necessary to demand from the remainder of aircraft production shall ber limijbbd to supplying assistance. to the repair and production of aircraft employed in the actualinvasion operations.(iv)    The repair of airfields shall be included among the services toreceive assistance if necessary;    and labour earmarked by theAir Ministry fox- this purpose shall not be diverted to other services.A.H.M.S..11th January, 1944.
