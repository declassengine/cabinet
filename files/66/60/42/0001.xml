THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 25.12th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.GROUND FACILITIES REQUIRED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM for international AND INTERNAL AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Minister for Civil Aviation.AT the War Cabinet meeting on the 26th October, 1944 (W.M. (44)141st Conclusions, Minute 2), I was asked to indicate in general terms the groundfacilities that will be required in this country for international and internal air services and their probable cost.2. These ground facilities consist, firstly, of airfields and, secondly, of aidsto flight in the form of signals, air traffic control and meteorological facilities.What is required will depend upon the routes to be operated and the density ofair traffic. It is independent of the number of operators or the form of organisa-tion that may be adopted for air transport. It is difficult to forecast these future requirements and my estimate is therefore tentative. One thing is clear; aconsiderable increase in international air traffic must be anticipated. this increase, coupled with technical developments, will call for ground facilities farin excess, both in cost and complexity, of anything that has hitherto been provided in this country.3. Airfields are the most costly ground facilities required for air transport.They fall into the following main categories : (a) terminals for trans-oceanic and other long-stage landplane air services;(&amp;) terminals for shorter stage Imperial air services and for continental air traffic;(c) airports adjoining large cities that may cater for some continental air traffic, but which will be used mainly by trunk internal air services;(d) airfields used by minor internal air services and for other civil flyingactivities such as flying clubs and private flying.4. Before the war there were no trans-oceanic landplane services terminatingin this country and the need for airports in category (a) did not arise. The Stateprovided the airports in category (b). The airfields in categories (c) and (d) wereowned by local authorities and others.5. After the war it will be essential to provide adequate terminal facilities in category (a). Without them we could not operate the Atlantic, and we shouldforgo the natural advantages of our geographical position in Europe as the link between Imperial and continental air services on the one hand and the maintrunk air routes of the world on the other. Airports in both categories (a) and (&amp;)will, as in the past, have to be provided by the State. They are national assets.Only the State could bear the cost of their construction and maintenance.Airfields in categories (c) and id) will, I hope, be provided, as in the past, by localauthorities and others, although their increased cost may involve provision bythe State of some measure of financial assistance to airfield owners. I propose indue course to present a memorandum on that subject.6. The numbers and types of airfields required under each of the foregoingheadings are set out in Appendix &quot;A.&quot; The requirements under (a) and (&amp;)will entail an estimated capital outlay of  23,000,000 with an abatement of 7,000,000 in respect of war-time or pre-war expenditure. The net capitalexpenditure in the post-war period will therefore be  16,000,000. About half[29027] b
this sum would be spent during the first seven years with the remainder spreadover a longer period. The estimated recurring expenditure for maintenance and management will rise to  650,000 per annum with an estimated annual revenue of  400,000. Details of these estimates are at Appendix &quot; C.&quot; The cost of the airfields required in categories (c) and (d) are referred to in Appendix &quot;A,&quot; but have not been included in the estimates.7. There remain the technical ground aids to flight which are essential tosecure the safety and regularity of air communications. Before the war the Stateundertook the provision of a comprehensive network of signals, air traffic controland meteorological facilities in this country to serve both international and internal air services. The bulk of the pre-war expenditure on technical facilitieswas for internal air services. Capital costs amounted to  350,000, while theannual costs were expected to be  312,000 when the internal organisation was fully developed. After the war the capital cost of the technical facilities for international air services will amount to. 1,553,000 and the recurring costs willbe  560,000 per annum. For internal air services technical facilities at an estimated capital cost of  1,613,000 will be required, while the recurring costs will amount to  666,000 per annum. Salaries for staff comprise about half therecurring costs.8. The estimates given in Appendix &quot; C &quot; of capital and recurring costs of the technical facilities are subject to review in the light of the future volumeof air traffic and any agreement that may be reached internationally regarding thestandardisation of ground aids to flight. Development work will have to beundertaken before war-time radio-navigational aids can be made available to civilaviation, and the future cost of this and other equipment is largely a matter ofspeculation.S.Ariel House. Strand. W.C.2,12th January, 1945.APPENDIX &quot;A.&quot;Post-war Civil Aerodrome Requirements in the United Kingdom.Trans-Oceanic Terminals.The main overseas terminal in this country for trans-oceanic land-plane air services must be located near London, the capital and the largest centre of popula-tion. The only suitable site available in the London area is at Heathrow and proposals for its development have been put forward by the Secretary of State forAir in W.P. (43) 482 and in subsequent memoranda. It is important that authority should be given in time for steps to be taken immediately after thewar to develop this airport.  A separate note on Heathrow is at Appendix &quot; B.&quot;2. It-will be necessary to make provision in other parts of the country for two other airports capable of handling trans-oceanic land-plane traffic asalternates when weather conditions at the main terminal are unfavourable. Itis expected that existing aerodromes could be adapted for this purpose at a relatively small cost. I feel strongly that we should select suitable airfieldswhich can be adapted with the minimum of expenditure of the taxpayers&apos; money and resist local political pressure for more costly schemes.Imperial and Continental Airports.3. Up to the present airports for Imperial and continental air services have been provided by the State and the cost of their construction, maintenance and management will have to continue as a charge on the Exchequer. Beforethe war the State airports at Croydon and Heston were the main terminals inthis country for overseas air services. Croydon is not capable of extension andits future role is probably that of a maintenance base. Heston is so nearHeathrow that its use as a terminal may not be possible when Heathrow isfunctioning and the land would ultimately be sold. The City of London hadplanned to provide a continental terminal and had purchased a site near Fairlopin Essex. This site has been developed as an R.A.F. airfield and its future use is at present uncertain. But the area available is so limited that it could onlybe used for continental traffic.
4. London presents&apos; a special problem and provision must be made forshorter stage Imperial and continental air traffic terminating in the Metropolis.Once Heathrow is fully developed with triple parallel runways it should be ableto cater for the overseas air traffic coming to London. Additional airports toserve the capital are nevertheless required for use until Heathrow is fully developed. Initially, two airports would be required one of which could be developed as a permanent training base for the British Overseas Airways Corpora-tion. It is probable that R.A.F. airfields could be adapted for this purpose, oneof which might be Fairlop.5. Two or three airports may be required in other parts of the UnitedKingdom as terminals for continental air services. Under present policy theseaerodromes would be provided by local authorities, although the State may haveto give some&apos; financial help. In addition further expenditure may be necessary on the selected marine base if flying:boats are to be used on Imperial air communications and this would have to be provided in whole or in part by theState.Airfields for Internal Air Services.6. The exact number of airfields required for internal air services cannotbe determined at present. Much will depend on the domestic demand for air communications. Only one-third of the 132 licensed civil airfields established in this country in 1939 were used regularly by. internal air services. While the frequency of air services may be greatly increased, it seems unlikely that morethan 60 centres of population in this country will require regular air transport facilities. Up to the present responsibility for providing these airfields hasrested with local authorities and others. For many reasons it would be desirableto continue this policy in the future if local authorities are in a position to bear the substantially increased costs of the improvement and maintenance of airfieldsrequired for internal air services. It may, however, be necessary for the State toprovide some financial assistance to airfield owners, particularly in sparsely populated areas such as the West of Scotland and in other areas where air services are required in the public interest.7. After the war a number of Royal Air Force airfields will become surplus to Service requirements. For strategic &quot;reasons most of these airfields have beensited in the South and East of the country. Owing to their location few wouldbe suitable for civil use and the greater part of the  300,000,000 expended ontheir construction will bring no future benefit to civil aviation.8. It should be noted, however, that the majority of the larger provincialairfields have been requisitioned for war purposes and have been improved atState expense. In most instances these improvements could be adapted for future civil aviation use. Precise figures of the capital cost of these airfields arenot available, but it is believed that  4,000,000 was spent by local authorities onairfield development up to 1939 and it is probable that a further  8,000,000 hasbeen expended by the State on improvements at municipal airfields during thecourse of the war. But not all municipal airfields have been improved at Stateexpense and it will be difficult to provide equality of treatment for airfield owners.The issues are complex and are under active review in the light of future air transport requirements and the needs of defence.9.   Summary.(i) Trans-oceanic terminals. One main terminal will be required.Provision&apos;should also be made for two other airports of this kind, asbad weather alternates,(ii) Imperial and continental terminals. Airports will be required in theLondon area as terminals for Imperial and continental air services.Their cost, as in the case of trans-oceanic terminals, will have to beborne by the Exchequer. Of these, two will be required untilHeathrow is fully developed. Two or three continental airports maybe required in other parts of the country. Under present policy theywould be provided by local authorities with possibly some financialassistance from the State, Additional work may be required on amarine base.(iii) Airfields for internal air services. Sixty airfields will be required for internal air services. Under present policy they would be provided and maintained by local authorities. This policy may need to be reviewed. .  ,[29027]. b 2
APPENDIX &quot; B.&quot;Heath Row.1. Further examination has shown that the Heath Row site can best be developed for civil aviation in one of two ways, both of which differ from theproposals that formed the basis of the scheme referred to in W.P. (43) 482. Boththe new schemes avoid interference with the Middlesex County Council&apos;s SludgeDisposal Works, which were a difficult and unavoidable feature of the originalplan.2. Scheme 1 would provide for a 3-direetional main runway system withrunways of 4,000 yds., 3,300 yds. and 3,300 yds. respectively, suitable for thelargest types of aircraft, with 2 additional parallel runways in each of the 3directions varying from 1,900 yds. to 3,500 yds. The cost of this scheme is broadly estimated at  13,500,000, of which  3,500,000 will have been spent onthe initial military development, giving a net cost of about  10,000,000.3. Scheme 2 would provide for a similar runway system with principalrunways of 4,000 yds., 3,200 yds. and 3,800 yds. respectively, suitable for thelargest types of aircraft, and additional parallel runways in each of the 3 direc-tions varying between 1,600 yds. and 3,500 yds. The cost of this scheme isestimated at  15,500,000, of which  3,500,000 will have been spent on the initialmilitary development, giving a net cost for the civil scheme of about  12,000,000.4. In either case, about half the total cost would be spent in the first seven years after the end of the war in Europe, the remainder being spread over a longer period. A higher proportion of the total cost would fall in the earlier years in the case of Scheme 1 than in that of Scheme 2.5. Both schemes incorporate work being carried out for military purposes.Scheme 1 would be confined more or less to the area originally proposed. Scheme 2would take in land north of the Bath Road which, under Professor Abercrombie&apos;sGreater London Plan, is to be re-sited farther North. There would, correspond-ingly, be some release of land at the south of the airport.6. Scheme 2 would ultimately involve more demolitions than Scheme 1, but,since it would be confined in the initial period to land south of the Bath Road,the major part of the demolitions would not have to be faced until some 6 or7 years hence, when the housing situation will be easier.7. Scheme 2 is rather more costly than Scheme 1, but it is a far better plan.It permits the siting of the terminal building in a &quot; central &quot; position in relationto the runways. This will improve the traffic capacity of the airport as comparedwith Scheme 1 by 13,000 movements a year. (This represents a saving of50,000 miles of taxying, 2,500 hours of taxying time.) Scheme 2 has ample spacefor ancillary buildings. Scheme 1 has not. The terminal building in Scheme 2can be of a shape that will give, the best possible lay-out for the convenience of passengers. Scheme 2 avoids the closing or diversion of the Great South-WestRoad and leaves room south of the airport for the construction of a StainesBy-pass, to which the Ministry of Transport attach great importance. under scheme 2 the construction of final terminal buildings suitable for the fully-developed airport can be deferred for several years, when more experience willhave been gained of the problems to be solved in connection with the design ofsuch buildings. Meanwhile, a provisional building, which can be erected quicklyto meet early post-war needs, can be used.8. The greater cost of Scheme 2 is fully justified by these arguments.Moreover, Scheme 2 will provide an airport that will bear comparison withIdlewild, the new trans-oceanic terminal for New York. Scheme 1, however,must always remain inferior.
