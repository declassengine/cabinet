[-113 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 194-5.SECRET. Copy No. %6 bW.P. (45) 2.m3rd January, 1945.WAR CABINET.STRATEGIC ASPECTS OF  INDUSTRIAL LOCATION.Report by the Distribution of Industry Committee.IN paragraph 26 (a) of the White Paper, on Employment Policy, Cmd. 6527,it is stated that, in exercising influence over the location of new factory develop-ment, the Government will take into account strategic, as well as industrial and social considerations. One of the questions to which the Distribution of IndustryCommittee have accordingly been giving attention is that of the bearing of strategic considerations on industrial location.2. After consultation with the Chiefs of Staff, the Joint War production staff have put forward the following four broad propositions as providingsuitable guidance for immediate purposes : -(a) Although the development of modern weapons is likely to increase thedanger of attack in the north and west of the British Isles, it will bedesirable for vital installations to be located in that region rather thanin the east and south.(b) The highest degree of security lies in dispersal in smaller units andduplication, and large and concentrated plants should, if possible, be avoided.(c) (b) overrides (a) i.e., dispersal in smaller units over the country wouldbe preferable to concentration in the west and the north.(d) In locating vital installations security would be increased if largecentres of population which themselves present profitable targets for attack could be avoided.   London is the supreme example.3. The strategic factor is, of course, only one of many factors which haveto be taken into account in considering industrial location. Subject to this point,we consider that the propositions constitute a reasonable interpretation of strategic considerations as applied to industrial location; and we recommendthat departments should be directed to pay due regard to strategic considerationsas so interpreted (subject to amendment from time to time), as well as to industrial and social considerations, in connection with the location of new factory development. In the practical application of such a, directive to individual projects much will, of course, depend on the interpretation to be givento the phrase &quot;vital installations,&quot; e.g., the extent to which it should beregarded as including factories vital to maintaining the civilian economy as wellas those for direct military requirements. This is a point to which we would propose to give further consideration.4. In the immediate future, however, the pattern of industrial distribution in this country will be affected less by the location of new factories than by thedecisions which will have to be taken regarding the future of the large numberof factories which were built during the early years of the war, as part of theGovernment/s dispersal policy, in relatively safe areas and areas away from thelarger centres of population. Jn our view, the most important practical conclusion to be drawn from the definition of strategic considerations in paragraph 2 above is that every effort should be made to ensure that these factories should be kept in being and should not be dismantled or dismembered in such a way as to make itimpossible for them to be used again at relatively short notice for the purposes for which they were constructed.[28941]r-i n
5. Broadly speaking, there are four ways in which, such a policy could beapplied in practice :  (i) Arrangements could be made for the factories to be absorbed into thepeace-time structure of the industries to which their present produc-tion is related.(ii) Arrangements could be made for the factories to be turned over to otherindustries for use in other lines of production, from which they couldrapidly be reconverted in an emergency.(iii) The buildings could be used for urgent storage needs, including the storage of surplus materials and goods which will require to be storedin large quantities, and thereafter they could be used for permanentGovernment storage of strategic reserves of material, e.g., aluminium.(iv) In cases where none of these alternatives was practicable the factoriescould be kept in being on a care and maintenance basis.It should be possible to adopt method (i) in the case of organised industries,whose scale of output in peace-time is not greatly less than in war-time. The ironand steel industry is a case in point. In other cases; e.g., that of the aircraft industry, which in peace-time will have to be reduced to about 15 per cent, of itspresent capacity the choice will probably have to be between methods (ii), (iii)and (iv). In such cases method (ii) is to be preferred to method (iii), and method (iii) to method (iv). But on occasions, and particularly in the case of factories in isolated situations, it may be necessary to fall back on method (iv).Such cases should be reported to the Distribution of Industry Committee. cold storage plants erected in order to have the necessary capacity away from theactual precincts of a port would fall into category (i) or (iv).6. The policy which we have outlined in the preceding two paragraphsshould be regarded primarily as a policy of insurance; and we have been led to advocate it mainly by the bitter experience of the early years of the present war.At the &quot;same time, since many of the factories in question are located in thedevelopment areas, it will fit in well with the Governments employment policy.From this point of view, however, it is desirable that, wherever possible, the factories located in the Development Areas should be&apos;kept in production andshould not be reduced to and maintenance basis.7. If the War Cabinet endorse the policy briefly outlined in the precedingthree paragraphs, we recommend that it should form the subject of a directive tobe issued to all departments concerned with the disposal of Government factories.(Initialled) E. B.(On behalf of the Committee).Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,3rd January, 1945.
