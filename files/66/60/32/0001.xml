/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT1 2 printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 15.8th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.POPULAR ACCOUNT OF BRITISH SCIENTIFIC WAR WORK.I ask the approval of my colleagues for the preparation of a popular accountof the scientific war effort which may be regarded as a companion volume tothe series of preliminary histories proposed by the Minister of Education.2. The need for an early publication of a popular record of the workof British scientists during the war is fundamentally the same as that whichhas led the Minister of Education to propose his series of preliminary histories(W.P. (45) 14). It is of great importance that some accurate information aboutthe contribution made by British scientists to the war effort should be madeavailable to the public both at home and abroad as soon as possible after theconclusion of hostilities in.Europe if the credit to which they are justly entitledis not to be prejudiced by inaccurate commercial publications or by the priorassertion of claims by foreign scientists.3. The form of the proposed account has been the subject of careful con-sideration by the Scientific Advisory Committee of the War Cabinet who havehad the benefit of the experience and advice of the Committee for the Controlof Official Histories. Scientific research in a number of unconnected fields doesnot easily lend itself to historical treatment and in any event the vast amountof research and experiment done during the war rules out the possibility of acomparatively short connected narrative. It is proposed therefore that, unlike the preliminary histories, the popular account of the scientific contribution to thewar should be selective rather than comprehensive and should deal in separatechapters with the scientific aspect of a number of distinct subjects such as, forexample, Radio and Radar, anti-submarine projects, the effects of bomb blaston human beings and buildings, dehydration of food and penicillin.4. The work of the scientist on these questions would be illustrated bystriking examples of the results which have been achieved in operations, andno difficulty is anticipated in finding a sufficient number of really first classexamples of British scientific achievement which can be safely published withina few months after the conclusion of the war with Germany. The actual subjectschosen will naturally require careful consideration, and, as the author of theproposed record will have to see a certain amount of secret material in thecourse of his work, particular attention will be paid to the security aspect inmaking this choice.5. The Scientific Advisory Committee of the War Cabinet has givenpreliminary consideration to the choice of a suitable author. After consultationwith the Committee for the Control of the Official Histories, it was agreed that what was needed was a scientist with an ability to explain scientific facts tothe average educated reader in an attractive and intelligible manner. No finalselection has been made pending Cabinet consideration of the proposal, but theCommittee have in mind someone like Mr. J. G. Crowther, Head of the ScientificDepartment of the British Council, who has had wide experience in explainingscience to the educated public.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.[28990]
6. The author chosen would work under the general control of the Super -visory Body which the Scientific Advisory Committee have appointed toco-ordinate and -supervise policy over the whole field of scientific recording ofthe war effort, and if the author lacked experience of Government scientificorganisation the Supervisory Board might find it desirable to appoint someonewith such experience to act as his guide and collaborator. The author would beattached to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research^ which wouldbe responsible for settling the precise terms of his employment with the treasury and for the provision of ancillary staff and facilities. When &apos; completed thework would be published by His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office, the copyright being-retained by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the author being remunerated by a lump sum fee.7. I accordingly ask my colleagues for authority to put in hand the proposedaccount and to proceed with the engagement of a suitable author.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W.I.8th January, 1945.
