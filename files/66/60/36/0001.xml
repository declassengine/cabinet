A conference of non-labour organisations summoned by Mr. Menzies,the Leader of the Opposition, was held- in Canberra from the 14th to 16th October,and was attended by 82 delegates representing 16 political organisations in allthe States as well as several members of both Federal Houses of Parliament.The Country party was not invited to be represented, the reason given being thatit already had well-organised machinery throughout the country in all States.3. Mr. Menzies expressed confidence that if the non-labour partiesorganised efficiently on an Australia-wide basis they could defeat the presentFederal Government at the next election. He proposed the formation of a Federalnon-labour organisation with a broad and liberal policy framed in a spirit ofpolitical revival which would find its expression in a real political movement.He desired that young people should be encouraged to take an active interestin the new movement and that it should be financed by rank-and-file contributions.He did not suggest that existing bodies should go into &quot; some form of uneasypartnership &quot; but hoped that a new movement might be brought into existence,and that existing organisations would, so far as practicable, go out of existencein its favour. All persons joining the new movement should do so on an equal footing through branch executives, all democratically chosen, and every membershould feel that he or she had an effective voice in policy and organisation. Ina word a new movement must come into existence unhandicapped by vestedpolitical or personal interests of any kind. &quot;We must look,&quot; he &quot;said, &quot; for a true revival of liberal thought which will work for social justice and security,for national power and national progress and for the full development of theindividual citizen and do that not through the dull and defeating process ofsocialism.&quot;4. Mr. Menzies put forward a programme which included 18 objectives.In the forefront he placed security against external aggression; closest communionwith the British Empire; arid participation in a world security order. His second point was that &quot; all who had risked their lives in the country&apos;s service should enjoy honour and security.&quot; This has been interpreted to mean preference to soldiers as well as the fullest repatriation benefits. Soldier preference is aquestion on which the Government has so far been able to avoid a declaration of[29011] . BSECRET.W.P. (45) 19.11 th January, 1945.
policy on the general ground that this war has been so widespread that nodistinction can be drawn in the matter of post-war employment between one sectionof the community and another. The Government puts its faith in an employment for all policy rather than preference in employment for ex-service men whichthey regard as tantamount to an admission that there will be considerableunemployment after the war. Mr. Menzies will no doubt seek to force theGovernment on the defensive in this respect and to obtain from it a declarationof its policy on the issue.5. In other respects the policy of the new party ran along well-worn lines,advocating full employment for all, security for farmers as well as city dwellers,improved living standards and health services, attractive homes, increasedpopulation and a national defence plan. Mr. Menzies denounced socialism,blessed private enterprise, repudiated &quot; Big Business &quot; as his ally and appealedfor the support of the rank-and-file in organising the party. This is an attemptto escape the traditional charge levelled against the United Australia party ofbeing the agent and mouthpiece of vested interests, and of being controlled fromCollins Street. This is probably the greatest weakness of the old UnitedAustralia party which had no roots in the electorates and only came to life atelection tiine. It had no regular rank-and-file membership and no policy except to keep Labour out. For some time the more enlightened of its members had come to realise that its political future was gloomy in the extreme unless itcould be remodelled and attract popular interest. Whether the platformoutlined by Mr. Menzies will achieve this object is open to doubt. On external affairs, the policy of the new party does not differ materially from that of theGovernment. Preference for soldiers is hardly a strong ground on which tojoin issue with the Government nor is that concerning the basis of social insurance schemes. Many experts on this subject here consider that Australiais wise to adopt the non-contributory basis for its social security schemes and tofollow the example of New Zealand rather than that of the United Kingdom.6. The programme is designed, however, to put the Government on the defensive and to make the most of public dislike of war-time controls which are represented as socialistic in method and objective and it is probable that this issue public v. private control of industry will constitute the main politicalbattleground between the two parties. Mr. Menzies is clearly ready to takeadvantage of whatever political opportunities present themselves whetherarising from internal restlessness in the Labour party or from public reactions to Government acts either of commission or omission.7. The new party is to be called the &quot; Liberal Party of Australia &quot; and itwill probably be some months before it is in a&apos; position to enter the politicalfield, press comment has been unanimously favourable, which is not surprisingsince there is no daily newspaper which can be said to be Labour although theGovernment has received generous support from the press, largely owung to thedissatisfaction of all practical politicians with the policy or rather the absenceof policy and the internal squabbles of the non-labour parties. The new party is welcomed as providing an effective and constructive opposition, thus lessen-being the risk of party dictatorship and over-regimentation. The Sydney MorningHerald and Argus especially praise the recognition of the need for the closestrelations with the rank-and-file in the constituencies by contrast with the methodof dictatorship by a &quot;hidden coterie&quot; collecting funds from &quot;interestedsources.&quot; It is felt that the objectives are perhaps rather vaguely stated and theAge (a staunch supporter of enlarged Federal powers) foresees that when theState branches of the new party begin to consider how the aims may be defined and carried out they will have to face the problem of the limitation of Staterights which their own leaders have helped to produce. The Argus remindsthe leaders that the party may have to be ready to spend a long time in opposition,but during that time it can impress the people by its political honesty andassiduous educational work. Personal tribute is paid by several writers toMr. Menzies though the Advertiser, alluding to Mr. Menzies&apos; well-known short-comings, says that, while he has worked so hard for unity, if he is to maintainit he must watch very carefully his own attitude to his colleagues.8. The private comment on the new Party by Mr. W. M. Hughes who, as anIndependent, was not invited to attend the conference, is worth recording as atypical Hughesian impromptu : &apos;&apos; Many men have raised the apparently dead;only one man is known to have raised the really dead, and Mr. Menzies, whateverhe may think, is not that  man.&quot;
9. The illness of the Prime Minister who, it is now announced, will not beable to resume full duties&quot;until the 1st January, comes at.a time when signs have become evident of unrest within the Labour Party and of a determination on thepart of the extreme elements in Caucus to press for the immediate execution of thefull Labour policy, in particular as regards banking control. In addition to this possible unrest within the Party itself the Government seems likely to be facedwith an Opposition anxious to take the initiative and to seize advantage of any government administrative deficiencies. The tendency which is becoming evidenton the part of the Trade Unions to attack the industrial arbitration system, fore-shadowing as it does an onslaught on the pegging of wages, is in direct challenge to the policy which Mr. Curtin has steadfastly pursued of placing maximumreliance on that system. Statements made by junior Ministers have, moreover,given the impression that certain members of the Government are privatelysympathetic to direct action and in the absence of the restraining influence of thePrime Minister the industrial situation is full of embarrassing possibilities forthe Government during the next two months.10. It is thought that the result of the Prime Minister&apos;s illness will be to defer the introduction of controversial legislation, especially on banking.Mr. Curtin&apos;s illness has, moreover, raised the question whether the Prime Ministercan any longer continue to sustain the combined strain imposed by personaldirect control of Parliamentary business and personal leadership of the Party.The burden on the Prime Minister has undoubtedly been very great. There are few measures introduced into Parliament on which he does not speak and, indeed,there is hardly a debate in which he is not called upon to take part. OutsideParliament, in addition to having referred to him all policy matters of any (and often comparatively minor) importance for decision, he has the worries which arise from his position as the keystone of his own Party, the difficulties created for him by junior Ministers &quot; with an axe to grind,&quot; and the burdensome taskimposed on him by the traditional Australian practice which requires the PrimeMinister to hold a daily Press conference. It is not surprising in these circum-stances that it should be feared that, unless the Prime Minister can be affordedsome relief, his return to duty will inevitably be followed by further breakdowns.11. There has been a certain amount of speculation as to whether mr. Curtin&apos;s health may not make it necessary for him to relinquish the PrimeMinistership, which would lead to a struggle for leadership of the Party betweenthe Right and Left-wing elements. The more likely course, however, appears tobe some reconstruction under Mr. Curtin&apos;s leadership with a revival of the plan to create Parliamentary Under-Secretaries to relieve Ministers of the necessityfor spending so much time in Parliament.12. Parliament reassembled on the 15th November. The main business willbe concerned with legislation to give effect to Australia^ contributions to theUnited Food and Agriculture Organisation and U.N.R.R.A., the amendment ofthe Financial Agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, and droughtrelief.Finance.13. The results of the opening weeks of the Second Victory Loan were dis-appointing and as the Loan was not filled by the closing date, the 30th October,it was kept open till the end of that week. Although final figures are not yet available it seems that the loan was not fully subscribed.  113^ millionnew money was subscribed and about 85 per cent, of the  47^ millionmaturing issues converted; cash subscribers were expected to number about400,000. This is some 53,000 less than the figure for the First Victory Loan lastMay. Various reasons have been given to explain the comparative lack ofenthusiasm complacency and a feeling that the war will be won whetherAustralia does anything about it or not; the continual exasperation of strikes and consequent contempt for the Government, and the frequent press reports ofGovernment waste and inefficiency.14. Some excitement has been caused in banking and business circles byan announcement in the press on the 18th October that the Federal Governmentwas planning to introduce next year a Bill to extend control over banking and to expand Commonwealth Bank activities, these objectives to be reached by per-manent retention of some of the wartime controls designed to make the TradingBanks subject to the Commonwealth Bank and by alteration of the Commonwealth[29011] .. b 2
Bank Board control by establishing direct or indirect Government control over its policy. Mr. Ward (the Minister for Transport and External Territories)speaking at a conference of Federal and State Labour Members in Sydney on the31st, said that this was &quot; a golden opportunity for the Party to carry out itsplans, since it now had control in both Houses of the Federal Parliament. It isunderstood that this and other contentious legislation is being left over till nextyear.Coal.15. On the 3rd October the High Court gave a ruling that findings by an industrial tribunal which the Government has created within the coal industry,awarding extra payments to miners working under certain conditions was a breach of the Governments own wage-pegging regulations. This led to a violentoutcry from the miners and to a demand that the wage-pegging regulations should be modified or repealed. The result was the issue of a National SecurityRegulation validating ail decisions given by the Boards established under theCoal Production (Wartime) Act and giving those decisions in future the forceof regulations under the National Security Act. This gives all Reference boards and other authorities in the coal industry the right to make decisions whichcannot be challenged in any court even on the grounds that they are a breach ofthe law and in effect withdraws wage pegging so far as it relates to coal miners.As the press has not failed to point out, if wage pegging is to be lifted from one section of the community it will be neither possible nor just to restrain other sections from demanding similar treatment.16. That the coal miners do not receive the wholehearted support of workersin other industries was shown by the issue jointly by the Australasian Council of trades Unions and the Miners&apos; Federation of a pamphlet which said that theTrades Unions sympathy for mine workers is being strained to the utmostbecause of the likely effects of coal rationing on the welfare of workers in otherindustries. It acknowledges that the coal shortage has led to interference withthe war effort, and though attributing some of the blame to &quot; provocative and un-co-operative attitude of certain owners and managements,&quot; says that one factoris the &quot; refusal of a few members in many collieries to accept the decisions of theunion and in some cases to set out deliberately to defeat those decisions. . . , .We are quite sure that nothing is further from the thoughts of the mine workersor other trades unions than such a strike in this period. .... Our industriesneed to work at full pressure; our railways need the fullest possible time tables.Only by reaching the target set by the Prime Minister can these things be done.&quot;17. The latest of many Ministerial statements on coal production was issued by the Acting Prime Minister on the 16th November. Production to theend of the third quarter of 1944 is 366,000 tons less than for the same period lastyear, and with coal production at present levels it would be absolutely impossible,he said, to build up reserve stocks for the three main consumers (railways, gascompanies and Broken Hill Pty. Co.) to an amount which will see them throughthe New Year. &quot; I have no desire to be an alarmist,&quot; said Mr. Forde, &quot; but I say frankly that a grave calamity can be avoided only as a result of a concertedeffort on the part of everybody engaged or even interested in the coal industrythroughout this country.&quot;   -18. The New South Wales Premier and Minister for Mines and theCommonwealth Coal Commissioner are meeting Senior Federal Ministers inCanberra to discuss &quot;problems which have arisen in the coal industry.&quot;Discussions are also taking place between Commonwealth Ministers and miners and Mineowners&apos; representatives.Industry.19. The period under review has been marked by a series of major industrial disputes with threats of more to come. The employees of one of the Sydneynewspapers, without any attempt to seek satisfaction through the IndustrialArbitration Court, struck in order to press a claim for a 40-hour week and four weeks annual holiday on full pay. All the Sydney newspapers combined tobring out a composite news sheet whereupon journalists and staffs, who alleged that the employers had created a lock-out by their action, published a rival newssheet using the premises and facilities of the Communist weekly Neivsletter.After a series of conferences between the disputing parties the matter was settled
by the courts on the 11th October, when the strike was described as illegal andunjustified, and a resumption of work ordered on the terms and conditions rulingbefore the strike.20. No sooner had this dispute been settled than one arose in the meatindustry, owing to the demand by retail butchers&apos; employees for a five-day week asoperated at the abattoirs. The proposal, involving as it does very real hardship to the public and institutions and waste of rationed meat in the sub-tropicalclimate of New South Wales, roused a storm &quot;of public protest. The courtsordered the unions concerned back to work and several were prosecuted and fined.A 24-hour stoppage of Sydney transport workers (excluding trams, buses and railways) took place on the 23rd October in protest against alleged delays inhearing arbitration claims for improved conditions. Efforts are being made todeal with delays by increasing the personnel of the bench.21. All these disturbances coupled with the coal situation have given riseto a flood of editorial and special articles in the press expressing alarm at thenation-wide unrest of labour and attempting to analyse its causes. It is saidthat Trade Union officials privately admit their anxiety and fear that thereis worse to come unless the Government has courage to enforce the law, and thatthe really vital causes of the trouble in the Unions are the fight for power betweenCommunist and anti-Communist factions, the all-embracing political plans ofthe Communists * (who are using strikes to achieve their objective destructionof the Unions and the Labour Party) and the weakness of the Government andthe Trades Hall chiefs. A writer in the Daily Telegraph, 28th October, suggeststhat &apos;&apos; a revolutionary situation exists &apos;&apos; with the unions challenging law and parliament; and an editorial in the same paper, on the 31st October, deploresthe action of the Government in allowing pressure groups to inflame the&quot;revolutionary situation.&quot;22. The National Secretary of the Ironworkers&apos; Union, a Communist, hasin a public statement advocated a return to the system of collective bargainingas more likely to induce the proper relation between employers and workers. Heattacked the Arbitration Courts on the ground that any substantial increase in wages was not possible within the present framework of wage fixation as adoptedby the Arbitration Courts. &quot;I repeat and go further and say that theprocedure of the Arbitration Courts promotes and encourages strikes. . . . Thereis practically no attempt to bring employers and unions together .... butalmost everything is referred directly to a judge and from then on proceedings are muffled in a mass of superlegal procedure which just irritates the workers and increases class conflicts.&quot;23. Another sign of the times was an article in the Sydney MorningHerald, of the 7th November, by the Secretary of the Printing IndustryEmployees&apos; Union, in which it was argued that the arbitration system had worked well enough before the war but was now so &quot; hamstrung &quot; by national security Regulations and war-time controls as to be worse than useless. Thepegging of wages had irritated workers and this had resulted in pockets of discontent among the unions which have no longer the means of winning their objectives of better wages and conditions. There was restlessness everywhereon account of regulations controlling business, supplies, manufacture anddistribution of goods, but the control resented above all others was that exercised by the Man-power authorities depriving the worker of his freedom to refuseor accept w^ork. Man-power controls had also disturbed the team spirit in industry.24. A further source of much anxiety has been the report that theAustralasian Council of Trades Unions intends to press the Government for aprosperity loading of 6s. weekly on all wages to offset the increased cost of livingwhich, it is argued, is not fairly represented by the prices index, as this excludesmany necessities such as vegetables which have increased considerably in price.Editorials in all major papers foresee a general attack on the prices and wagescontrol and point out the imminent danger of inflation if once the spiral begins.Drought.25. The drought is now regarded as the Avorst in the history of Australiaand is causing very great anxiety. It is accompanied by dust storms of unusualintensity and duration, reaching right over the east coast, and bringing sharplyto mind the accompanying menace of dust-bowl conditions in the west.   The
situation is made more alarming by the threat of serious outbreaks of bush fires.In many districts, including the prosperous Riverina, wheat and fodder crops are a complete failure while stock losses are formidable. Dairy farming is as yet comparatively unaffected as the coastal districts have been enjoying favourable conditions, but the fodder failure is bound to affect it in some months&apos; time,while the egg shortage will also be increased by lack of grain foods for poultry.The latest estimates by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics isthat the 1944-5 grain harvest will be less than 50 million bushels, the lowestsince 1919-20, of which little more than 30 million will reach the Wheat Board,the rest being required for seed and farm use. (In 1939-40, a record year,196 million bushels were delivered to the Board.) Australia^ wheat needs forthe next 12 months are estimated at 90 million bushels, and the carry-over of62 million bushels will have been completely exhausted before next year&apos;s crops are ripe. Shortage of other food-stuffs will increase the calls on wheat, for ifstarving sheep are to be saved through several more barren months, large quanti-ties of grain will be required. All the fodder cut in the least affected areas will not suffice, and in any case only a minimum of it could be used for thatpurpose. Wheat is the only alternative and the Commonwealth government must decide whether to release more grain for the sheep or to hold allstocks for human consumption. The situation has led to a demand on theGovernment for the abandonment of the wheat restriction scheme which isblamed for the present plight, and the Government is being criticised for failing to heed warnings about the conservation of fodder and to release adequate man-power to take advantage of last year&apos;s excellent season.26. The  3 million allotted by the Premiers&apos; Conference in October fordrought relief is to be paid to farmers on a basis of 12.?. 6d. per acre plantedwhere no crop has been harvested, the cost being borne equally by commonwealth and State Governments.27. It is difficult for that large section of Australia&apos;s population whichlives in the cities to realise the literally appalling situation which prevails in the drought areas. Dead and dying stock litter the country, high winds are blowingaway the top soil, families are vacating farms, and on a smaller scale the dustbowl conditions of middle Western America are being reproduced. The Govern-ment has done its best to bring home the true facts of the situation by meansof films. Once again public attention is being focussed on the allied problemsof wind and water erosion and the urgent need for a far-sighted long-range plan of reafforestation as an adjunct to larger water storage and irrigation services.External Relations.28. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Forcle, and the Minister for external affairs, Dr. Evatt, represented Australia at the first meeting held in Wellingtonbetween Australian and New Zealand Ministers for which provision was madein the &quot; Anzac &quot; Pact. On his return Mr. Forde said that the conference hadbeen an outstanding success and that the discussion had led to the adoptionof a series of resolutions which were incorporated in an agreed &apos;&apos; statement of conclusions.&quot; Some of the matters discussed which involved consultations withother Governments could not be made public. A copy of the secret conclusionshas been furnished to me by the Minister for External Affairs and copies ofthis document and of the published statement have already been despatched toyou by my colleague in New Zealand.30. Perhaps because it was not held in Australia and perhaps because ofthe feeling that the original&apos;conference gave rise to misunderstandings overseas,the meeting has received surprisingly scant notice in the Australian press and very little editorial comment. The Government itself soft-pedalled on the advancepublicity in regard to this conference in marked contrast to the advertisementgiven to the first conference, and it has been suggested that this was due to amarked sensitivity of the Federal Government to the criticism provoked inAustralia and America by the decisions of the first conference.31. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the United Kingdom high commissioners in Canada, iMew Zealand and the Union of South Africa.I have, &amp;c.W. C. HANKINSON,(For High Commissioner).
