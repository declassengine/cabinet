THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA&apos;JESTY-&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 23.11th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT&apos;S STATE OF THE UNION message to CONGRESS, 6th JANUARY, 1945.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WHAT chiefly interests us in the Presidents recent message to Congressis the warning to Americans against the danger of perfectionism in the field of foreign affairs and the statement that &apos;&apos; power must be linked with responsibility.&quot; While making it clear, without expressly saying so, that his remarks in this connexion were not meant to be construed as approval for currentBritish policy over Poland or Greece, the President reminded his audience thatthe American revolutionary war also left behind it a legacy of lawlessness andmany difficult problems of adjustment which could not be solved overnight, andthat though it was good to have principles by which to be guided, the atlantic charter did not &quot; provide rules of easy application to each and every one ofthis war-torn world&apos;s tangled situations.&quot; Americans should remember thatit did not help for any nation to assume that it had a monopoly of wisdom or ofvirtue and that they had missed their chance of establishing a durable worldorder after the last war precisely because they did not have the courage to fulfill their responsibilities in an admittedly imperfect world. Americans should therefore not be put off from supporting the work begun at Dumbarton Oaksas a result of their concern with the immediate problems of adjustment in thevarious liberated territories. I feel sure that the President meant this to be theprincipal lesson of the message, particularly as he ends the message by sayingthat the most important reason of all for believing that 1945 can be the greatestyear of achievement in human history is that &quot; 1945 can and must see the substantial beginning of the organisation of world peace.&quot;2. But the message was so long and contained so much else which Americanswil] have found easier to understand and of more direct interest to themselves that I rather doubt whether the lesson about perfectionism will have sunk verydeep into the minds either of Congress or the public. Most Americans arecontent to read headlines and summaries, and the points which will have caughttheir eye most are the Presidents warning that American losses would be heavy,his figures on the falling-off of production, his call for the tightening of conscription laws and the passage of a National Service Act, and his long reviewof the wrar, which one commentator has described as &quot; so comprehensive as to besuggestive of the reports which Mr. Churchill gives to Parliament.&quot; These arethe points which I am afraid will have most interested Americans.3. The President went rather out of his way to emphasise the success of collaboration in the war between the Americans and ourselves, and Lord Halifaxthinks that among other things he had it in mind by this to suggest that therecent exchanges of criticisms between the presses of the two countries might now cease.4. He also went very much out of his way to pay compliments to the Frenchfor having returned to the ranks of the influential nations and he particularlymentioned those &quot;who refused to surrender after the disaster of 1940.&quot; Thathe should have done this is, I think, a measure of the fundamental popularity ofFrance in America and of. the anxiety of the Administration to be finally free of the suspicion of being Vichy-phil.5. The American press has called the message &quot; prudent,&quot; &quot; statesmanlike,&quot;&quot;realistic,&quot; &quot;courageous&quot; and &quot;grim.&quot;A.
