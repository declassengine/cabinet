(45) 4.Uh January, 1945./Copy No.WAR CABINET.YUGOSLAVIA.Note by the Prime Minister.I circulate herewith, for the&quot; information of my colleagues, a copy of a letterI have received from King Peter of Yugoslavia.W..S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,Qth January, 1945.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET.copy of a Letter dated 29th December, 1944, from King Peter II of yugoslavia to the Prime Minister.Dear Mr. Prime Minister,Deeply convinced that you are a sincere and great friend of my countryand myself, I trust that you will not mind if I hand you in writing one part ofmy considerations regarding the factual and constitutional side of the problems which are facing me at present.During our last meeting of the 21st December, 1944, in the presence ofMr. A. Eden and the Ambassador, Mr. R. Stevenson, you expressed the opinionthat it would be advisable for me to accept and endorse the Tito-Subasicagreements regarding the Regency council, the composition of the future,Government and the elections of the Constituent Assembly.We parted that I may think over the matter and give you my reply. I have very conscientiously considered the problems and made up my mind, and am givingyou my reply obeying my conscience and fully aware of my responsibilities.Before anything else I consider it necessary to quote the following :  (a) After Dr. Subasic&apos;s return, and before our meeting, I had received from him, or through the services of your Government, these documents : (1) The agreement concluded by Tito and Subasic of the 1st November,1944.   (Annex 1.)(2) Amendment of the 7th December, 1944, regarding elections for theConstituent Assembly and the administrative machinery to beset up immediately.   (Annex 2.)(3) Amendment of the 7th December, 1944, dealing with King&apos;sproperties and with Regents.   (Annex 3.)(4) Official communique of the 7th December, 1944, published after theconclusion of Tito-Subasic negotiations.   (Annex 4.)(5) Questionnaire addressed to Dr. Subasic by Sir Orme Sargent andSubasic&apos;s reply (the 13th and 14th December, 1944).  (Annex 5.)(6) Aide-memoire by Dr. Subasic to me of the 17th December, 1944.(Annex 6.)(b) During the whole absence of Dr. Subasic from the 13th October to the12th December, 1944, I had not received from him a single word on what he was doing, although I had asked him expressly before his&apos; departure not to^ accept definitely and not to sign any agreementwithout a previous consultation with me and with the Royal Govern-ment in order to avoid any uncalled-for situation and subsequentdifficulties for himself and for me.(c) Nobody up to date has given me a copy of the Amendment dealing with&apos; the composition of the Government^ quoted in the questionnaire,Articles 8 and 9.Now, I propose to analyse, in detail and impartially, the facts laid down inthe documents quoted above.The signatories stress in the agreement that &quot; proceeding from theprinciple of continuity of Yugoslavia as a State from the international point ofview &quot; and &quot; in view of the fact that Yugoslavia is recognised among the united nations in her old form and as such functions they will continue to representour country in relation to the foreign world in all acts of the foreign policyin the same way, as long as our community of State, future democratic and federalYugoslavia, does not receive, by a free expression of the popular will, her definitei form of rule.&quot;Till that moment, the agreement continues, I could not return to the country.In my absence the Royal Power could be in the hands of a Royal Regency.* Annex 7,[28945] &apos; B
This Regency, the agreement continues, should be created by a constitutionalRoyal Act (by me) on the proposal of the Royal Government in the way decided by the Tito-Bubasic agreement.At the same time, the composition of the Government and number of itsDepartments (with omission of the names of their titulars) are fixed by theagreement.As to the way to appoint members of the Government, nothing is said. the communique of the 7th December, 1944, however, says : &quot; It is agreed upon toform a single Government out of representatives of all nations and federal unitsof Yugoslavia and to bring into it individuals of different political orientationsprovided that they support basic aspirations of the National LiberationMovement.The questionnaire deals only with the agreement. There are three questions in the Article 1 : (a) What will be the powers of the Regency? (b) Will the regency have all the powers of the King as set forth in the Yugoslav Constitution,:including that of dismissing or modifying the Government? (c) If not, whowill determine the powers of the Regency ?Dr. Subasic&apos;s reply to all of them is : &quot;Asa rule, the Regency has the same rights which are normally enjoyed by the King. If further developments in yugoslavia should require amendments to the Constitution, they would be carriedconstitutionally on the basis of the present constitution.I must particularly stress that Dr. Subasic in the reply on this questionsays : &apos;&apos; The present Constitution provides for the possibility of a Regency and states its rights and duties.&quot;If we analyse the questions and the reply, one sees immediately that thereis only an evasive reply to the questions (a) and (b).It was not asked, what were &quot;as a rule the powers of the Regency,&quot; and what would happen &apos;&apos; if further developments should require. ...&quot; The questionis clear and to the point and pertinent to the time being. The articles of theConstitution dealing with the matter are perfectly clear and unambiguous.Art. 2 of the questionnaire says : &quot; Will the Regency consult the King orwill they have a blank cheque to act in the King&apos;s name ? &quot; The reply is : &quot; the regency has the right to consult the King,&quot; but no obligation to do so.Art. 5 of the questionnaire says : i(a) Has a draft of proposed declaration been prepared ?(b) Will all the Yugoslav political parties be allowed to function freely?(c) Will former leaders of the Serbian, Croat and Slovene political parties-  now in this country and the U.S.A. be enabled to take part in political life, in Yugoslavia if they so desire ?From the reply it is obvious that there has been no reply given to the question under (6). The reply to question (c) is evasive, saying that &quot; it is clear from theamendment regarding the election to the Constituent Assembly that formerpolitical leaders will be able to take part in political life.&quot;The reply to Art. 10 is clear.At this point I must make a reference to the regulations of Arts. 41 and42 of the Constitution. As I am not minor of age and am not &quot; permanentlyincapacitated to perform my constitutional duties,&quot; the Royal Regency in thecase of its establishment-could be chosen and appointed only by me.Art. 12.- The question and answer are clear. I stress the following sentence of the answer : &quot;It would have been difficult to make a more promising choice.&quot;That statement I believe is not correct as there are many outstanding men in my country who could, if required, fill this highly responsible position.It is obvious from the answer to Art. 13 that the Royal Government willnot be able to exercise any influence.The answer to Art. 14 is not reassuring. It says : &quot;If the King&apos;s constitu-tional position is not adequately covered that is dictated by the present situation.&quot;Without, at this time, going into the other important statements containedin the documents, it is evident what is demanded of me.I am asked to transfer the execution of my constitutional rights without being consulted previously. The reason for that is the alleged fear of myinfluence on the free expression of the popular will regarding the form ofGovernment in Yugoslavia.I must here solemnly state that I have never been and shall never be againstthe freely expressed will of my people. I have never been against the organisa-tion of future Yugoslavia in conformity with the will of my peoples.   I consider,
however, that nobody fair-minded can blame me if I demand and do all in mypower to assure a really free expression of the popular will. If I unflinchinglycontinue, at this grave hour, to defend the rights of my people as well as myconstitutional Royal rights, I am sure that my own country as well as my greatAllies will understand and share my feelings.How is this matter dealt with in the above-quoted documents ? In what wayare my people&apos;s rights and my Royal constitutional rights protected ?  In no way!I am asked to change the Constitution regarding the Regency and to appointthose persons as Royal Regents who were chosen by Marshal Tito and Dr. Subasic.According to their Agreement, this Regency would have a right and not an obligation to consult me. They consider that such terms are a full protection tomy constitutional rights !   I cannot agree with that.How can I put my faith in this proposed Regency and how can I be securein their respect for the Crown and its rights when I do not know its members atall and when I have nothing to say regarding their choice, and, moreover, since they are to be appointed by me on a dictate instead of by constitutional means 1According to the agreement, the Regency, once appointed, could &apos;&apos; if further developments in Yugoslavia should require amendments to the Constitutionchange the whole Constitution.   What is then the value of the Constitution and how are the constitutional rights protected ?   All that is in contradiction with what is said in the questionnaire, &apos;&apos; will be carried on constitutionally.&apos;&apos;I am a young King, but during my reign I have pursued a policy and taken a stand as the King of my country which I can now retrospectively be only proudof. This gives me sufficient right and strength to address myself to my people and unhesitatingly to place myself for their judgment.I took over my duties on the 27th March, 1941, in the moments in which,Mr. Prime Minister, according to your statement in the House of Commons,Yugoslavia had found her soul. These events are publicly praised and celebratedby the National Liberation Movement. They are absolutely linked up with myperson. The slogans of these memorable days were : King Peter is with us;King Peter is against the Tripartite Pact; the King is for the collaboration withthe Democracies, &amp;c.It is true that subsequent events had.quickly broken the organised resistance of my country, but they have never broken either the resistance of my peopleor that of myself. Having left my country with my Government, I haveuninterruptedly continued to collaborate with my great Allies. You, Mr. PrimeMinister, know better than anybody else that I have never done anything contraryto the interests of the United Nations, and that I have never hesitated1 to follow the advice given to me by the great Allies.And what am I asked to do at present ?   I am asked to tacitly abdicate.I can never do that, neither openly nor tacitly.   I have no right to do it asI am the constitutional King.According to the Constitution I am the supreme guardian of permanentinterests of my people. The people have a right to ask me, any time, how have i guarded their interests ? Therefore it is my&apos;duty to see to it that the interestsof all peoples and of all the classes are being equally safeguarded.I, meanwhile, once more declare that I will never oppose the freely expressedwill of my people. For this reason, and till that moment, I must have fullguarantees that the popular will shall be really freely expressed. Moreover, i cannot transfer the King&apos;s constitutional power unless I have got guaranteesthat it would be used according to the Constitution and freely from any pressure.My conscience tells me that I must insist on this, and I would regret verymuch if this feeling of mine were not shared by my great Allies.I have been told that all political parties had already declared their attitudem &quot;us matter and that they had endorsed the Tito-Subasic Agreement. Noproofs have been given to me, nor have I heard this from any other source. Onthe contrary, I know that nobody has consulted them, and that there is no wishon the part of the party leaders to condone the formation of a Government onthe form proposed. That is unmistakedly said in the communique of the/tii December, 1944 : &quot;It has been agreed to form a single Yugoslav Govern-ment composed of representatives of all nations and federal units of Yugoslavia,and that there must be appointed individuals belonging to different politicalorientations providedSince the totality of power would be in the hands of such a Government-is clear that there is a tendency to establish a totalitarian regime   Whoever[28945] &apos;        B 2
does not adhere to the regime would be eliminated. I venture to say that doesnot seem to be in accordance with your statement expressed in the House ofCommons on the 8th December, 1944 : &quot; I say that the last thing that represents democracy is the attempt tointroduce a totalitarian regime and clamours to shoot everyone who ispolitically inconvenient as part of a purge of those who are said to and )very often have not have sought to collaborate with the Germans duringthe occupation. Do not let us rate democracy so low, as if it were merelygrabbing power and shooting those who do not agree with you. That is theantithesis of democracy; this is not what democracy is based on. Democracyis not based on violence or terrorism, but on reason, on fair play, on freedom,on respecting other people&apos;s rights as well as their ambitions.&quot;I am in full agreement with this statement, and expect its application inmy case.To conclude :Nobody can deny my constitutional right to perform my Royal power myself.If, however, general conditions require that I remain abroad for a while, I askyour help, Mr. Prime Minister, so that we may together, in mutual friendship and trust, find a solution which would be in accord with the Constitution of my country, and which would guarantee the protection of the rights of my people as well as Royal Constitutional Duties during my absence.I remain, Sir,Sincerely yours,PETER II R.ANNEX 1.Agreement between the President of the National Committee of liberation of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito, and the Prime Minister of the RoyalYugoslav Government, Dr. Ivan Subasic.In compliance with the principle of the continuity of the Yugoslav Statefrom the point of view of international law, and the clearly expressed will ofall Yugoslav nations, demonstrated by their four years&apos; struggle for a new,independent and federal State, built up on the principles of democracy, we desire and make every effort for the people &apos;s will to be respected at every stepand by everybody, both with regard to the internal organisation of the Stateand to the form of government, and therefore intend to comply with thefundamental and general principles of constitutional government proper to alltruly democratic States.Yugoslavia being acknowledged among the United Nations in its establishedform, and functioning as such, we shall continue to represent our country abroad and in all acts pertaining to foreign policy in the same way, up to the time when our State, the democratic, federative Yugoslavia of the future, assumes, by a free decision of the people, the definite form of its government.In order to avoid any possible tension of relations in the country, we haveagreed that King Peter II shall not return to the country until the people havepronounced their decision in this respect, and that in his absence the Royal power should be wielded by a Regency Council.The Regency Council will be appointed by a constitutional act of the King,on the proposal of the Royal Government, and in agreement with the Presidentof the National Committee of Liberation of Yugoslavia, Marshal J.

In the event of the Agreement of the 1st November being accepted,the Royal Power is to be transferred to the Regency Council for the period ofthe King&apos;s absence from the country until the people decide upon the form ofthe State through the Constituent Assembly. The present Constitution providesfor the possibility of a Regency and states its rights and duties. As a rule, the regency has the same rights which are normally enjoyed by the King. If further developments in Yugoslavia should require amendments to the Constitution, theywill be carried constitutionally on the basis of the present Constitution. Thelaw concerning the nomination of the Regents will be an instance of this procedure.Ad 2. The Regency has the right to consult the King and vice versa, asforeseen and guaranteed in point (2) of the amendment regarding &quot; the propertyof His majesty the Kiner and the Resrencv Council.&quot;
Ad. 3.   An answer to this question has been given in the amendment aboutthe &quot; Elections to the Constituent Assembly.&quot; (Annex 2.)Ad. 4.   Id. quod ad 3.Ad 5. The draft declaration of the new Government could not very con-veniently be prepared before that Government was even formed. The only thingthe Agreement between Marshal Tito and myself could do was to give guaranteesthat the declaration of the Government will be based on the principles of demo-democracy and that these principles will be observed by the Government.As to the right to elect and be elected, it is contained in point (1) of theamendment.regarding the &quot; Elections to the Constituent Assembly.&quot; (Annex 2.)It is clear from this amendment that former political leaders will be able toiake part in political life.Ad 6. An answer to this question appears in the amendment concerningthe &quot; Elections to the Constituent Assembly.&quot; (Annex 2.) Naturally, every party will enter the electoral campaign with its own programme.Ad. 7. The Agreement will come into force immediately after its acceptance by the King.Ad. 8. An answer to this question has been given in the amendment relatingto &quot; the formation of the Government,&quot; (Annex 7.)Ad. 9. An answer to this question figures in the amendment relating to&quot; the Formation of the Government.&quot; (Annex 7.)Ad 10.   Yes, it has been finally decided.Ad 11. The National Liberation Army will, immediately after the formingof the Government, be -cleared to be the Regular Army. Outside this Army therewill be no military formations. The police and the rest of the administration will be organised by the Government in conformity with the amendment concern-ing the organisation of Public Powers. The guarantees given in respect to theelections to the Constituent Assembly exclude any possibility whatsoever of inter-ference with the elections by physical force.Ad 12. All the Regents are between 60 and 70 years of age. From thepoints of view of culture, education and political career, it would have been difficult to make a more promising choice.Ad 13. The present situation in Yugoslavia requires a Government readyto consecrate all their efforts to the interests of the peoples and the State. It isdifficult to speak about the influence of individuals, and far more important tobear in mind their capacities and the confidence they enjoy among the people.Ad 14. In so far as this procedure is dictated by the present situation asthe only acceptable solution we cannot but abide by it.14?A December, 1944.ANNEX 6.Aide-Memoire to the King of Yugoslavia from Dr. Subasic,17th December, 1944.ON Yugoslav territory, already liberated, there exists to-day only one authority, known as the National Liberation Front. The backbone of the national liberation Front is the Army, still called National Liberation Army. when and if State authorities are established on the basis of the Agreement concluded by Marshal Tito and Premier Subasic, the National Liberation Army is to become the Regular Yugoslav Army and to assume that name. Both the A.V.N.O.J.(Anti-Fascist Council of Liberation), as the provisional legislative body, and theNational Liberation Committee, at present acting for the Government on liberatedterritory, are organised within the National Liberation Front. They are allbased and dependent on the National Liberation Army. Let there be no illusionsthat, in the near future, i.e., up to the complete settlement of conditions in thecountry, any authority could be independent of this Army. The Commander-in-Chief of this Army is Tito, and he is at the same time the embodiment ofevery other authority within Yugoslavia. It would prove impossible to wreckhis authority in the country to-day.On the other hand, the legitimate authority of the Kingdom of Yugoslaviaexists abroad, represented by the King and the Royal Government. The founda-modifications on which this authority rests, are the Constitution and the law of the country.
These foundations and, consequently, this representation of the Kingdom of yugoslavia are the stronger the more they are supported from abroad, i.e., bythe Great Allies and the other United Nations. The need for the national liberation Front to enter into conversations, to accept compromises and make concessions to the legitimate representation of Yugoslavia merely arises fromreasons pertaining to the foreign policy and the international position of yugoslavia.These facts having been truthfully stated, the question arises whether andto what extent those agreements are of consequence, which have been reached byTito, as the representative and embodiment of the situation in the country, onthe one hand, and myself as the Prime Minister of the Royal Government andthe representative of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and its legitimacy in the sphere of international relations on the other hand.When I agreed to form the Government,&apos;I was conscious of the difficult task and the great responsibility I was assuming both with regard to my own country and to the Great Allies and all United Nations waging war against thecommon enemy. I was&apos;concerned not only about the policy of the Yugoslav Stateduring the war, and the responsibility for the present fortunes of yugoslavia and her peoples, but also, and perhaps even more so, about the fate of yugoslavia and her peoples in the final phase of the war and in the ensuing transitional period up to the final settlement of conditions in the country.If these tasks are to be accomplished, the policy of Yugoslavia must aim at(a) at home, the unification of all fighting and political groups among the people,and (b) abroad, the maintenance and development of friendly relations with, above all, the Great Allies, and then also all the other United Nations. By such a policy,disorder and civil war are being avoided, rehabilitation sped up, and thebuilding-up of a strong and well-balanced State promoted. At the same time, theestablishment and maintenance of a lasting peace in this part of Europe is thusachieved. So far, all the activities of the Royal Government have entirely beendevoted to this end.The struggle for the national liberation of Yugoslavia has the characterof a revolutionary struggle. Having started when Yugoslavia entered the war,it developed in the course of the war, and there is every chance of its endingat the conclusion of the war. This revolutionary character of the people&apos;s strugglein Yugoslavia is a manifestation of the people&apos;s reaction against all that has,in the course of Yugoslavia^ existence, proved to be anti-national and detri-mental to the people. On closer examination, these revolutionary emotions of thepeople would appear to have a national rather than a social character. Thismeans that the people, in their struggle against the enemy, sought a way tosolving those problems in Yugoslavia which had proved the most tiresome andmost dangerous and which had brought about such a speedy collapse in the firstdays of the war. They have, indeed, caused many appalling events, as, e.g., themassacre of Serbs and, later on, the fratricidal war lasting for three and a half years. Communism on the side of the national struggle for liberation was but an excuse for Serbian quislings and national extremists to dispose of the Serbianpartisans, to organise a quisling regime in Serbia and to secure their hegemonyin post-war Yugoslavia.The events in Serbia, the cruelty of the Serb quislings and of DrazaMihajlovic on the one hand, and the heinous crimes of the Croat and Slovenequislings on the other, acting in collaboration with and under the direction of italian fascism and German nazism, have driven the people in the western partsof Yugoslavia into forests and mountains, Avhere they have achieved completeunification through the exertions of the common struggle. This strife was wagedin the first line against fascism and nazism and consequently against everything in connection with fascism and nazism. The principles on which a new Yugo-slavia is to be built up have evolved in the course of this struggle. To what extentthese principles have become a real and essential feature of all the nations of yugoslavia is. conclusively proved by the struggle for national liberation andits achievements to date.In Yugoslavia, the peasantry represents more than 75 per cent, of the popu-lation. The respect of private property and a deeply-rooted religious sentimentare the source of all those popular ethical principles on which alone a truedemocracy can be built. The struggle for national liberation has safeguardedthese principles. On their basis it has developed not only mutual tolerance, buta perfect brotherhood of the Yugoslav nations. The terrible sufferings and&quot;&quot;uiuiio ui luiiiuo uovc iu oliui axi ouicnguiiciicu ano ueeueneu. the ioftvfeelings of human solidarity, that there is no danger of democracy not assertingitself arid ruling supreme in Yugoslavia.[28945] .    c
There.can be no doubt that many efforts and sacrifices will still have to bemade by Yugoslavia and her peoples in the pursuit of this aim, set forth by themovement for national liberation of an (a) independent, (b) democratic, and(c) federal Yugoslavia. If Yugoslavia and her peoples are to shorten their pathtowards this goal, and not to lose it, they need assistance. This assistance would consist, above all, in.a full understanding of the will of the people, in the true-appreciation of their struggle, and the acknowledgment of the principles atthe basis of the new State. If the Great Allies will be willing to consider Yugo-slavia and the struggle of her peoples in this way, I would venture to state thatthe period of revolution in Yugoslavia will be closed at the conclusion of the warand that Yugoslavia may well become the first democratic country not only onthe Balkans but in Europe which would achieve internal pacification.Nobody can maintain that everything is for the best in Yugoslavia but, fullyconscious of my obligations towards my people, I cannot but defend and standup for the present struggle for national liberation, because only in this waythe war for the liberation of Yugoslavia can be won and the people caused tosettle down to positive and constructive work and to take part in the re-organisa-tion of the State.It wrould be a most fatal development for Yugoslavia if a conflict was tobreak out between the legitimate representatives of Yugoslavia, i.e., the king and the Royal Government on the one hand, and the movement for national liberation-tion in the country on the other, especially if this conflict were to be assisted byan intervention from abroad. Three and a half years of suffering have broughtalterations in the very foundations of the political life of Yugoslavia, and its former prominent figures will be able to play a role once more only if and whenthey will again be able to understand the people and the people to understandthem. Therefore I should submit that it would be a great mistake if the GreatAllied Powers would receive and adopt the interpretation of those politicalphilosophers and practical politicians who still remain in the sphere of unreal,theoretical speculations about developments and possibilities in Yugoslavia-One of the most difficult tasks of the Royal Government was to find a compromise between the principle of legitimacy of the State as the only repre-sentative of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the comity of nations on the one hand,and the fiercely blazing struggle of the people for their liberation on the other,in order to avoid civil war. With all due modesty, I dare say that nothing couldstop me on this path. Fear, humiliations, contempt, and calumnies coming from different quarters and chiefly out of the country were unable to wreck my feebleefforts towards attaining this goal. I have done all I possibly could and myconscience is clear in this respect.Regency.The King will not be able to return to the country until the people decide,by their own free will, upon the future regime of the country.The King will not be able to return to the country because, by such a compromise, the struggle of the people and the unity of theNational Front wouldnot only be endangered, but there might even be a possibility of its breaking down,and, of a civil war flaring up. Such a compromise would prove to be a tool in thehands of elements hostile to a united Yugoslavia, of political speculators whowould like to assume power by their already notorious methods, misusing for thatpurpose the authority of the King. All past experience of public life in Yugo-slavia up to the present war points to the fact that power used to be foundwherever the King was. Such a compromise would jeopardise the confidence ofthe peoples of Yugoslavia in their sovereign will being respected, and would be interpreted to the effect that the restoration of the old regime is about to be imposed by force upon the people. The arrival of the King in the country would cause bloodshed among the people in which even the King himself mighthappento be one of the casualties.In order to maintain the continuity of the Yugoslav State and to secure for it an adequate position in the comity of nations, we agreed, though not without difficulty, that in this transitional period, up to the Constituent Assembly&apos;conclusion of its task, the Royal Power should be exercised by a Regency. It istrue that, according to the Constitution and the laws of the Kingdom of Yugo-slavia, the Royal Power would, during the King&apos;s sojourn abroad, usually havebeen discharged by the Royal Government. When this rule was adopted, it wasimpossible to foresee that the King might have to be absent from his country for
a long period. In these times, however, when the presence of the King isnecessary in view of taking urgent constitutional measures, I have been looking for a body which would replace the King in respect of all his prerogatives andbe the visible representative and guardian of the Crown in Yugoslavia. the regency Council would be such a body.Therefore the Regency, as their first act, take the oath to the King in front of the whole nation, the whole country and the rest of the world. The King andthe Regency are linked together. Their intercourse is secured and guaranteed inthe amendment to the agreement on the &apos;&apos; Property of the King and the RegencyCouncil,&quot; and the continuity of his rights is provided for in the rulings regardingnew appointments to the Regency Council. Thus the King reasserts his powereven after one, two, three, five months or later, whenever there are any changes inthe Regency Council, with the concurrence and on the proposal of the Government.The Government.A new Government is to be formed in the country. The resignation of theold, and the forming of the new Government by a, mandate from the Regency willbe carried out in the ways observed when the mandate was obtained from theKing. The Government take their oath to the State and the people. They do not take an oath to the King. The reasons for this arise out of the intention to escapeany doubt within the country as to the Government following only the will of thepeople without any limitations. Further, it has been thought wise to spare to theGovernment the possible reproach that they wish to camouflage their views on thefuture regime of Yugoslavia both during the preparations and the electoral cam-paign for the Constituent Assembly and during the actual proceedings of theAssembly. The relations between the Government and the Regency as regards thesafeguard of the principles of democracy and the existing Constitution of yugoslavia will remain the same as those now existing between the Governmentand the King. The new Government of Yugoslavia will represent the countryabroad as Royal Government in all acts pertaining to the diplomatic representa-tion of the State, maintaining the continuity of the country and its present formuntil the people decide about the future regime.Having in view the present disposition of the people struggling in Yugoslavia,I consider that the movement for national liberation have gone as far as they could in this compromise. At the same time, this is a proof of their will and of theirsincere efforts towards safeguarding democracy and building up the State ondemocratic principles.The A .V.N.O.J. and democracy.The A.V.N.O.J. (Anti-Fascist Council of Liberation) is a legislative bodybuilt up in the struggle for national liberation, which is to exercise the legislativepower until the Constituent Assembly is elected. It consists of delegates of themovement for national liberation similarly to the way in which delegates were appointed to the First Yugoslav Parliament in 1918, which was in function untilthe Constituent Assembly was elected in 1920. There will be only one difference,namely, that in the 1918 Parliament there were, besides the delegates of theNational Councils of various Yugoslav lands, also members of the Serb Parliament.As Yugoslavia entered the war without Parliament, this new legislative body canonly consist of delegates of the existing National Committees.The functioning of this legislative body will begin after the forming of thenew Government. The A.V.N.O.J. will also be responsible for adopting a lawregarding elections for the Constituent Assembly.ANNEX 7.Formation of Yugoslav Government^1.
