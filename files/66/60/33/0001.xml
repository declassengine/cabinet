THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOTffiRNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 16.8th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.CZECHOSLOVAK FRONTIERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Czechoslovak Government recently communicated to the Chairman ofthe European Advisory Commission a document setting out their requirements in connexion with the surrender terms for Germany and Hungary. The mostimportant of them is a demand for the restoration of Czechoslovak administrationwithin the pre-Munich frontiers of Czechoslovakia. This would involve the resumption of control by the Czechoslovak Government over all the areas taken from Czechoslovakia at the time of Munich by Germany, Hungary and Poland.2. When I saw Dr. Benes on the 27th November this question was discussed and I spoke in the sense of the attached formula, adding that, although I had notyet consulted the Prime Minister and my colleagues on this point, I thought thatthis would be the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I made a reservation,however, that the allocation of the Teschen area was a matter which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment still considered must be settled between the two Allies concerned,viz., Czechoslovakia and Poland, and that it must therefore be excepted from theprovisions of the formula.3. Since then, the Czechoslovak Government have told His Majesty&apos;ambassador that they very much hoped I would reconsider my decision aboutTeschen, which had, after all, been filched from Czechoslovakia by Poland at thetime of Munich. On further consideration, I am inclined to withdraw this reservation. It seems likely, however, that when the Russians liberate Teschen,they will hand it over to Czechoslovak administration. If we are prepared toaccept this fait accompli, if and when it comes, as indeed we shall have to do, we might as well get the advantage of it vis-a-vis the Czechs, by expressing our agreement now. While we should, of course, prefer not to favour one ally at theexpense of the other, the seizure of Teschen at the time of Munich inflicted awrong upon Czechoslovakia, and I think we should be justified in supporting the Czechoslovak demand to be allowed to administer the Teschen area in thesame way as the other areas concerned, pending a final territorial settlement.4. I therefore now seek the concurrence of my colleagues in the attachedformula, which, while conceding administrative control to the czechoslovak government of all areas lost to Czechoslovakia at or after Munich, involvesHis Majesty&apos;s Government in no commitments regarding a final territorial settle-ment. If my colleagues agree, I would propose that His Majesty&apos;s ambassador should approach the Czechoslovak Government informally for their concurrence in this formula, and that if this is granted the United Kingdom representative on the European Advisory Commission should then inform his colleagues of thisinformal agreement between the Czechoslovak Government and ourselves andenquire whether their Governments would also be prepared to accept it.A. E.Foreign Office, 8th January, 1945.12627   [28992]
ANNEX.Draft Formula.IN his note of 5th August, 1942, addressed to the Czechoslovak Minister forForeign Affairs, Mr. Eden declared on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom that, as Germany had deliberately destroyed the arrangementsconcerning Czechoslovakia reached in 1938, His Majesty&apos;s Government regardedthemselves as free from any engagement in this respect. Mr. Eden added that atthe final settlement of the Czechoslovak frontiers to be reached at the end of thewar, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be influenced by any changes effected in and since 1938.Bearing this declaration in mind, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom for their part agree that the Czechoslovak Government should exercisefull administrative control from the date of the unconditional surrender ofGermany throughout the area bounded by the frontiers of Czechoslovakia as theseexisted before the arrangements reached at Munich in 1938, referred to in thepreceding paragraph. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider, however, that thequestion of sovereignty, as opposed to that of administrative control, must remainin abeyance until the international frontiers in Central Europe are definitely laiddown in the peace settlement.
