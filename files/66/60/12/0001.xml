THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.XCopy No*SECRET.W.P. (44) 762.22nd December, 1944.WAR CABINET.CONSTITUTIONAL POLICY IN MALAYA.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Committee on Malaya and Borneo.ON the 31st May, 1944,* the War Cabinet approved a directive on policy in malaya to the authorities responsible for planning for the Civil Administrationof Malaya on liberation.t The War Cabinefs approval was subject to theunderstanding that no publicity should be given to the policies contained therein.2. Since the date on which the War Cabinet reached their decision, theColonial Office and War Office have been moving forward with the necessary plans for the administration of these territories on the basis then authorised. these plans have, of course, been disclosed only to those directly concerned in them, butthe increasing disadvantages of this secrecy have been urged with great weightfrom various quarters. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has been in correspondence with the Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia, who hasstrongly represented to him the importance of making known our future plans ingeneral to the peoples whom those plans will affect. Admiral Mountbatten holdsthat the proper reception of our future policy in Malaya depends upon its being fully explained beforehand, and that the time is now ripe to do this., 3. In advancing this point of view, the Supreme Allied Commander isthinking not only of long-term considerations, but also of the creation of afavourable atmosphere for the setting up of a military administration for whichhe will be responsible. Moreover, those-responsible for present operations of aspecial character within his Command have made the same case for their ownreasons. So much so that the organisation in question has had to be given certain,general guidance on the subject for the use of its agents. It has also been necessaryto give similar guidance to the organisation engaged in similar operations inBorneo.4. Then again, the authorities engaged in Political Warfare and in theenlightenment of the public both in this country and in the United States ofAmerica have strongly pressed their need for a new Malayan&apos; directive whichwill be based on a forward policy and will reflect that policy.5. The Secretary of State for the Colonies is not yet convinced that the time has come for our plans to be divulged in full, since this would involve committing ourselves to every feature of those plans, at a time when many relevant facts are by force of circumstances unknown to us. Nevertheless, he attaches great weight-to the Supreme Allied Commander&apos;s views, and believes that the essential needsof Admiral Mountbatten and others could be met for the present by the distribu-tion to selected circles of a broad statement of the fundamental problems in malaya which bear directly upon the political, administrative and economicfuture of the country. At the same time there would be distributed, not for publication, but in confidence purely for the background use of restricted circleswhich can guide and influence thought and discussion of the subject, a brief statement actually setting out the main features of our proposed policy. drafts of these statements and proposals as to their distribution are enclosed atAnnexes I and II.6. The Ministerial Committee on Malaya and Borneo have considered andconcur in the Colonial Secre.tary&apos;s proposals and in the draft statements, whichI submit for the covering approval of the War Cabinet.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 122nd December, 1944.On behalf of the Committee,(Signed) C.

ANNEX I.DRAFT STATEMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS IN MALAYA.MALAYA, though a geographical unity, is not in fact a single country, inthe sense in which Great Britain or France are single countries. Malaya formsneither a racial nor a constitutional entity, and an appreciation of this fact isessential to any understanding of the problems we shall meet on our return.2. The Malay Peninsula, as organised under British control, consists of aBritish Colony (the Straits Settlements, the most important of which areSingapore, Penang and Malacca) and of nine Malay States, four of which arejoined in a Federation. Until about 1870 the nine States remained entirely separate and entirely independent they were largely isolated by mountains andjungle and British control was confined to the Colony. From then o^disturbances caused by pirates and by foreign (mainly Chinese) infiltrationcaused the several Malay Rulers, separately and at different times, to seek Britishprotection. To this day the whole British position in the Malay States restsupon Agreements concluded with the individual Rulers agreements which in substance and interpretation provide for British advice (to be acted upon in all matters other than Malay religion and custom), but which leave the Rulers, fromthe legal point of view, as sovereign princes.3. The spread of British influence has brought co-ordination in many things,but the separate entity of the States remains none the less a reality. The Malayscherish a definite loyalty towards their Rulers, and this feeling conflicts with thedevelopment of any allegiance towards a larger unit than the State. There isno widespread conception amongst the Malays that they are &quot; Malayans,&quot; withcommon duties and problems; and this is the first problem which must be faced in Malaya, if the country is to advance towards nationhood and self-government within the British Commonwealth.4. The second problem is that of race. The extraordinary economic development which has accompanied the spread of British influence, and the extensive introduction of capital and enterprise from China and India has ledto a situation in which the non-Malay population in Malaya now outnumbersthe Malays, though the majority of the former still regard their original landsrather than Malaya as their real home. The resultant problem presents specialobstacles to the development of a sense of common citizenship in Malaya. Onthe one hand, the relations of the British Government with the Malay states are based on a recognition of the right of the Malay peoples to a secure positionin their lands and in their educational and other facilities for progresss. On theother hand the enterprise and capacity of the non-Malay peoples of the country,provided they be accompanied by a sense of civic responsibility, assert a claim that should exercise a due share in the moulding of Malaya&apos;s future.5. Mention has been made above of economic development. It must notbe thought that racial or parochial factors have been allowed to hinder allprogress. Far from it. The economic, social and educational record of Malayaunder British control is unsurpassed in the Far East. In these fields the workof great research organisations, such as the Rubber Research Institute and theMedical Research Institute, is recognised throughout the East. Along with thetask of guiding Malaya towards her political destiny, the duty of restoring these and other valuable institutions and adapting them to future conditions and needs will clearly rest upon the Government and industry. The economy of Malayahas in the past been founded on the two great industries of rubber and tin. Theimportance of these natural resources must be re-established, and also a healthybroadening of the basis of Malayan economic life will be a pressing need.6. The condition of the country and the temper of the people which weshall find on the eviction of the enemy after his prolonged period of occupationremain to be ascertained. But it is not too early to think and plan in termsof a forward policy in the country for the promotion of a growing cohesionand sense of political unity.   If any of the features mentioned in this note are
found to be obstacles to such a development, and if liberation is to be comprehensive-sive and not merely related to the eviction of enemy forces, measures wSneedto be considered and concerted with all concerned to liberate the nL Malagafrom old barriers and prejudices, and it will be important that those who havethe responsibility for the lines on which the new Malaya is built sha also be vested with the power to overcome any reactionary interestsProposed Distribution.(a) Official. (b) Non-official.(a) All United Kingdom Government Departments and Representatives in britain and abroad, concerned in the policy in Malaya, including South-East AsiaCommand, United Kingdom High Commissioners in the Dominions, political warfare Missions and Ministry of Information Representatives, colonial governors and Diplomatic Posts in the East.(b) Non-official Representatives, persons and associations concerned withMalaya, e.g., Association of British Malaya, Malayan Associations in India,Australia, Ceylon, South Africa; Overseas Chinese Association in India; MalayStudents&apos; Association in England.A note should accompany the paper to the effect that it is not intended fortextual publication as an official Colonial Office statement, but for guidance as tocertain fundamental issues in Malaya of which Government decisions on policy must take full account.ANNEX II.draft STATEMENT ON FUTURE POLICY IN MALAYA.EFFICIENCY and democratic progress alike demand a change in thepre-war constitutional and administrative system of Malaya. The former requirescloser union between the Malay States, and the latter requires that advance towards self-government shall be a development towards participation ingovernment by the people of all the settled communities in Malaya (subject to special recognition of the interests of the Malay race), and not merely towardsautocratic hegemony by the Malay Rulers. At present the British position inthe Malay States rests entirely upon agreements concluded with the several Rulers,under which they remain in a strictly legal sense sovereign and independent,though they are bound in fact to accept British advice on all matters except Malayreligion and custom. It is now contemplated that, as a first step, new treatiesshall be sought with the Rulers, which would give His Majesty a sufficient measureof jurisdiction to enable him to legislate for the States under the ForeignJurisdiction Act. This first step would make further progress possible. AMalayan Union would thereafter be created, comprising the nine States and theBritish Settlements of Penang and Malacca (but not Singapore, which, at least for the present, would be administered as a distinct colony under a separateGovernor). For the Malayan Union a constitution would be devised, whichwould provide for a single united authority representing the States and the settlements, subject to the jurisdiction of His Majesty under statutory powers.Amongst the measures designed to make the Malayan Union a reality would bethe creation of a Malayan Union citizenship, for which all those whose settled and permanent home is in Malaya would be eligible, irrespective of race. At thehead of the Union Government would be a Governor with an Executive and a legislative Council. The co-ordination and direction of the policies of Govern-ment in the Malayan Union and Singapore would be secured by the appointmentof a Governor-General at Singapore, who would have a power of control also overthe British authorities and representatives in North Bornea, Sarawak and Brunei.
