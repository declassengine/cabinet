It is, of course, assumed that the Greek Government will be supplied with the necessary arms and equipment.With particular reference to Macedonia where for obvious reasons the matter has a wider Balkan significance, the presence of British forces will in any case benecessary.At the same time both the Greek Government and the whole Greek politicalworld formally reaffirm their intention to seek the Greek people&apos;s verdict at theearliest moment, and they are resolved to ensure by every means considered necessary the genuine expression of the popular will.Yours very sincerely,GEORGE &apos;II R.The Right Hon.

&apos; ANNEX IIThe King- of the Hellenes has received the following messages from an absolutely trustworthy person in Athens : 1. &quot; There is great resentment among the Athens population over therumours regarding a Regency and an amnesty for the insurgents. Mr. Sophoulis(leader of the Liberal Party) told me he is opposed to the idea of a Regency ashe considers it most inopportune and consequently highly suspect in relation tothe Communists&apos; intentions. He recommends Your Majesty not to agree. he added that the Popular Party holds the same view in this matter. A similar statement was made to me by Mr. Theotokis on behalf of the National PopularParty. I am informed that the Regency idea is supported only by theE.A.M., Mr. Kaphandaris and Mr. Lambrakis. Everybody else agrees that your majesty should resist at all costs.&quot;2. &quot; The Liberal Party and the Popular Party have taken a definite stand against the idea of a Regency. The Prime Minister (Mr. Papandreou) is resistingsuccessfully and with very powerful arguments. The British Governmentsrepresentatives bow before the Premier&apos;s logic, but insist that something must bedone. It is the general hope that Your Majesty will not yield. The current infavour of The King&apos;s return has swollen even more. Archbishop Damaskenosis regarded as the Communists&apos; only hope.&quot;London, 19th December, 1944:ANNEX III.-Telegrams received by His Majesty The King of the Hellenes.1. From MM. P. Rallis and Stephanopoulos:&apos;&apos; A retreat on the question of the Regency in the midst of the revolt woulddisillusion the Greek people who are now in a state of agony and would affectthe morale of the men now resisting the rebels in an outraged state of mind.Referring to our previous telegram, we stress that such a concession would beregarded as a great victory for the rebels and a justification for the revolt, andwould have grave repercussions on the future policy of Greece, whose interests are irrevocably bound with Great Britain. The British Government can restassured that once Athens has been cleared, the enthusiastic demonstrations of thepeople and the liberated working classes now groaning under the oppression ofthe administrations imposed on them by the E.A.M. Ministers will enlightenBritish and American public opinion that it is not a question of a democraticLeftist movement,  is it seeks to present itself, but of an anarchist terroristicminority seeking to impose its domination by force of arms. The political world,which is agreed in the view that the raising of the Regency question is inopportuneand dangerous, was shaken by the formal assurance of the British representatives that the position of that great Englishman and faithful friend of Greece,Mr. Churchill, was rendered difficult.&quot;2. From M. Spyro J. Theotokis;,--&apos;&apos; The views of the National Popular Party on the question of the Regencyremain unchanged. The matter could be considered only if external reasonsrendered this unavoidable. We stress the necessity of making no concessions to the left now in revolt.&quot;3. From Mr. P. Hadjipanos:- &apos;&apos; Reaffirming the desire of the Union of Political Co-operation, whichsupports a crowned democracy, that Your Majesty should make every effort toavoid a Regency under the present critical conditions, we consider that evengraver dangers would follow such a course of action.&quot;4. From Mr. A. A lexandris: &quot; Internal reasons in no way make necessary the appointment of a Regency.On the contrary, the consequent harm would be great, particularly as this wouldbe taken as a triumph for the Communists, who are already beaten.   Above all,
the prestige of Great Britain in Greece would greatly diminish before such a concession to the enemies of the vast majority of the Greek people and such anunwarranted diminution of Your Majesty&apos;s prestige.&quot;5. From Mr. Garoufalias: &apos;&apos; Participating in the Government as representative of the Socialist Union,I have the honour to submit to Your Majesty that the appointment of a Regencyin the present circumstances would have the worst possible repercussions on theGreek people and would produce great despondency and anxiety over the futureof the Greek State.&quot;London, 20th December, 1944.
