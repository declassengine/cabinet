THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT   printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 7.5th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.CANADIAN CONSCRIPTION CRISIS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I annex, for the information of the War Cabinet, a despatch from the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner at OttaAva reporting on the controversy aboutreinforcements for the Canadian Army. This despatch is in continuation ofthat from the Deputy High Commissioner annexed to W.P. (44) 719.C.Dominions Office,5th January, 1945..   ANNEX.Office of the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom,(No. 656.) Eamscliffe, Ottawa,My Lord, 7th December, 1944.IN the postscript to his despatch No. 620 of the 11th November,Sir Patrick Duff had the honour to report to your Lordship on the statement issued by Colonel Ralston regarding reinforcements for the Canadian Armyoverseas. This strongly-worded statement produced a profound effect and causedan immediate heightening of the controversy. Public opinion on both sides wasroused and press comment became even more violent. Leaders of the other partiesalso became more outspoken in their criticism of the Government. Mr. Brackenissued a statement, with the full authority of the Progressive Conservative Party,calling upon the Government to &quot; fulfil its duty to our men overseas and carryout the will of the people, as expressed in the plebiscite, by passing the necessary order in Council and sending the available men in the Home Army as reinforce-ments forthwith.&quot; Mr. Coldwell, National Leader of the C.C.F., also expressed his personal opinion that &quot; we have to see to it that our men are fully supportedand reinforced whatever that means.&quot; But he added that the necessity couldonly be determined by access to information in the possession of the Government,2. The general position of the press was that virtually all English-languagepapers supported overseas conscription. The French-language papers almostwithout exception were strongly opposed to conscription. The single exceptionwas the independent Le Jour, which in any case now expresses the view thatit is now too late for conscription. Independent and Progressive Conservativepapers, which form a majority, expressed the conviction that conscription wasnecessary at once and that the Government were breaking the pledge made in 1942.Liberal papers generally held that the Government would honour its pledge,but were not convinced that the time had yet necessarily come for action. CertainLiberal papers, however, took an independent line; most significant of these was the influential Winnipeg Free Press, normally a strong supporter of theGovernment, which said that Colonel Ralston&apos;s statement would &quot;disturb andalarm the nation&quot; and added that &quot;it is difficult to believe that the presenttest of the voluntary principle can last much longer than the end of November.&quot;3.   It should, perhaps, be recorded that certain officers tendered theirresignations after Colonel Ralston had left the Government.   Amongst these[28978]Copy No.     O
were Colonel Dyde, Military Secretary to the Minister of Defence, andMr. MacDonald, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister. Brigadier Mess,Director of Recruiting for the Canadian Army, has also since resigned.4. In the meantime, the Government proceeded on the assumption that conscription for overseas service would not be necessary. General McNaughtondemanded in a public statement &quot;that the method of voluntary enlistment begiven a fair trial.&quot; He also published details showing the composition of theCanadian Army and the figures of men called up under the N.R.M.A. Theseshowed that since D-day voluntary enlistments for overseas service had beengreater in number than the enrolment of compulsory service men, and that duringthe present, year 10,000 enrolled men volunteered for general service. Of thepresent 60,000 men in the Home Defence Army the language composition was asfollows :  English-speaking only ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      18,000French-speaking only ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       12,000French and English-speaking ...       ...       ...       ...      14,000Foreign language-speaking    ...       ...       ...       ...      16,000The hard core of men enrolled since 1941 who had not volunteered for overseas service was 6,200, of whom nearly 3,000 came from the Province of Quebec. Thefigures for provinces showed that Quebec had the highest total in the HomeDefence Army with nearly 23,000 men; Ontario had 15,000 men, and the remainingprovinces some 21,000. The number of army volunteers was highest from Ontariowith 216,000, whereas the number from Quebec was only 83,000. It may becommented that the percentage of volunteers to conscripts is 4 to 1 in the province of Quebec, 14 to 1 in Ontario and over 20 to 1 in Nova Scotia. It is also not without point that the percentage of men in the Army to the total male population is 1 out of 7 in the Province of Quebec compared with 1 out of 4 as the averagein the remaining provinces. While, therefore, it is true that proportionatelyFrench Canada has a larger number in the Home Defence Army and a smaller number of volunteers, and also a larger number who have escaped military servicealtogether, it is by no means true that the Home Defence Army is largely confined to French Canadians or that French Canada has not contributed a substantial number of volunteers.5. General McNaughton summoned to Ottawa the General OfficerCommanding the Pacific Command and the officers commanding all militarydistricts to discuss with them means to provide the number of men required by voluntary methods. Some stir was subsequently caused at a press conference inwhich senior officers of the 6th Division at Vancouver told the press that theydid not believe that the overseas troops could be adequately reinforced by voluntarymeans. Major-General Pearkes himself stated that &quot; in view of the urgencythere must be a greater increase in the numbers volunteering than has beenevidenced since General McNaughton&apos;s appeal was first made.&quot; This gave riseto considerable comment, and General McNaughton has sent an officer to investigate the situation : but no more has since been heard of the matter. these and similar reports that attempts to secure the men by voluntary means had failed led to rumours that the Government had changed its mind, but these weredenied both by the Prime Minister and by General McNaughton.6. Major-General LaFleche, the French Canadian Minister of national war Services, who himself had a fine record in the Last war, took upon himselfthe responsibility of arranging to find the men needed for French Canadianunits in action. &quot; If reinforcements are required we will find them, and we will find them by our own means and not by insult,&quot; stated the General. &quot; I toldyou that with 4,000 volunteers, conditions will be quite different.&quot; Speaking ata subsequent rally General LaFleche said that he himself had offered to go tothe front. &quot; When I found out that the situation was serious I asked the PrimeMinister if I could go back to the front line. I offered, as a guarantee of thegood faith of my compatriots, my life, my sword and my portfolio.&quot;7. It was in an atmosphere of charged emotion and complete uncertainty as to what developments were likely, that the curtain rang up in the special session of the House of Commons on the 22nd November. There was a fullattendance in the House and the galleries were crowded beyond capacity. ThePrime Ministers statement was largely confined to reading the text of the correspondence which had taken place between him and Colonel Ralston on theoccasion of the latter&apos;s resignation. Without giving any indication of the Govern-menfs policy, he moved the adjournment of the House. The ProgressiveConservative Leader sought to introduce a resolution demanding &quot; that all trained
troops in the Canadian Home Defence Army should immediately be despatchedfor reinforcement overseas,&quot; but this was ruled out of order by the Speaker. TheLeaders of the C.C.F. and Social Credit parties also spoke, but confined theirremarks to stating that the full facts should be presented to the House before it could reach a decision.8. On the following day General McNaugton (who is, of course, not yeta member of the House) attended by a special arrangement to report on thesituation. The proceedings were, however, opened by the Prime Minister whoannounced that the Government bad already issued an Order in Councilauthorising the despatch overseas of personnel serving by reason of their havingbeen called up under the provisions of the NR.MA. Act in such numbers as maybe approved (the number mentioned in the Order in Council being 16,000).General McNaughton in his subsequent statement said that, when he took officehe took the stand that Canada&apos;s traditional system was capable of producingthe results sought and of producing them in time, and that he had thereforepressed the application of the voluntary system by every means. He added thathe had discussed the situation with all the senior commanders in Canada whohad undertaken to see that the reinforcements would be met, but he had to admit that the results had not been adequate. He was advised that there were very many N.R.M.A. men who would not volunteer in the present circumstances, but who were quite willing to be sent overseas. &quot; It is our purpose,&quot;&quot;said general mcnaughton, &quot;to maintain the voluntary system to the limit.&quot; But, he added,it was essential to maintain a substantial reserve of reinforcements availableoverseas; he had brought the facts before his colleagues in the Cabinet and theOrder in Council had accordingly been passed extending the service of the numberof men required to the European theatre of operations. He mentioned, however,that this power would only be used to the extent necessary to make up the numbersof reinforcements required. General McNaughton was subsequently submittedto a gruelling interrogation by members of Parliament which lasted from the afternoon until 11 p.m. and was continued on the following day.9. The news of this introduction of partial conscription for overseas servicecaused great bewilderment. The Press was so confused that some papers hadheadlines &quot; Conscription introduced&quot; while others said &quot; Voluntary system tobe maintained.&quot; The decision was clearly taken overnight as no indicationhad been given on the previous day that such a change in policy was likely. Nodoubt, as General McNaughton stated later, the reports from the District officers on the lack of success of their attempts to secure reinforcements had some influence on the decision, but there can be no reasonable doubt that the views of the liberal party Caucus, which sat till late the previous evening, also played a considerable part. The general reaction was summed up, perhaps not altogether unfairly,by a Conservative paper commentator as being &apos;&apos; half of the country is cryingtrickery. The other half is crying treachery.&quot; But though neither extreme hasbeen satisfied, at least the anti-conscriptionists had been convinced thatMr. Mackenzie King had done all in his power to prevent conscription and someof their opponents had been satisfied that at least the immediate problem of sending reinforcements had been met.10. The only noteworthy defection from the Government has been the resignation of Major Power, the former Minister of National Defence for Air.There were rumours that Mr. Fournier, the French-speaking Minister of PublicY^orks would also resign, but these proved ill-founded. Major Power&apos;s resigna-tion came as some surprise as he had previously been rumoured as one of theMinisters likely to resign with Colonel Ralston; but his letter of resignationmade it clear that it was the introduction of conscription alone which made himleave the Ministry. Major Power&apos;s statement in the House was a somewhatastonishing performance; he criticised the strategy of General Eisenhower whichwas to strike the enemy and give him no rest and he proclaimed that neitherultimate victory nor national honour required that Canadian troops should bein action every hour every day, especially when thousands of Europeans werepanting for vegeance on their oppressor. Later, Mr. Jean, Parliamentary Assis-tant to Mr, St. Laurent, the Minister of Justice, has also resigned. On the dayon which his resignation, was announced he moved an amendment in the Houseurging that overseas conscription be not resorted to. So far less than half-a-dozenin the Liberal Party have crossed the floor in the Federal Parliament. These are all French-Canadian and most of them had previously shown evidence of theirindependent feelings : their loss will scarcely be noticed in the comfortablemajority of the Liberal Party.[28978] , B 2
11. In Quebec, the Leaders of both Provincial Parties have spoken.Mr. Godbout, the Leader of the Liberal Opposition, castigated the government&apos;s decision as &quot;sudden, unexpected and unexplainable &quot; and warned the OttawaGovernment that it would have to count on the Opposition of the Liberals ofQuebec. Mr. Duplessis, the Premier, took a more dignified and more cunningstand. He expressed confidence that Quebec would, set an example of respect for law and constituted authority, but he went on to warn that the legislative powers conferred by the constitution give the right to punish and chastise atthe proper time &quot;which is the election time.&quot; The Provincial Government ofQuebec have since issued an Order in Council asking the Federal Governmentto &apos;&apos; respect and fulfil its solemn engagements and sacred pledges against con-scription for overseas service.&quot;12. The only incidents reported since the Governments decision was announced have been some acts of rowdyism in Quebec, where there have beenreports of tearing down of the Union Jack and more serious disturbances, par-ticularly in the Pacific Command, e.g., some acts of rioting, sometimes withviolence, and of refusal to obey orders in various camps in British Columbia.It should be noted that the trouble is by no means confined to French-Canadianunits. These acts of lawlessness show a deplorable lack of discipline and the publicity attending them has been harmful. The Prime Minister persists indeclaring that they are &quot;by no means mutiny.&quot; However that may be thereis no reason to believe that a firm control will not be established for the time being.13. When the House met again after the week-end on the 27th November,the-Prime,.Minister delivered his expected declaration defending the whole policyof the Government. Mr. Mackenzie King rehearsed the history of the conscrip-tion issue since the beginning of the war and particularly since the time of the1942 plebiscite. He reiterated that at that time the Government took the position that there should not be conscription for service overseas because of the moral obligation that their word had been given before the war that, if war came, resortwould not be had to conscription for service overseas. He emphasised that theview that the plebiscite gave the Government a mandate to carry out conscriptionwas &quot; an entire falsification of the interpretation of the plebiscite.&quot; Speakingof Colonel Ralston&apos;s recommendation to the Cabinet, the Prime Minister saidthat the House must realise &quot; the impact of the shock that came upon the Govern-ment.&quot; He dealt in detail with the events of what he termed &quot; Crisis No. 1,&quot;culminating in Colonel Ralston&apos;s resignation and, speaking of the Governmentsstand, made the point that Colonel Ralston&apos;s request for overseas conscriptioncame after five years of war under the voluntary enlistment method and on whatwas believed to be the very eve of victory. He referred to the consequences whichthe introduction of compulsory service overseas might have for Canada, particu-larly on her relations with other parts of the British Commonwealth and withthe other United Nations and on the world organisation for peace after the war was over. The Prime Minister admitted that he had consulted general mcnaughton before Colonel Ralston&apos;s resignation was accepted, and made theinteresting remark that he did not know at the time, and did not know yet, whatGeneral McNaughton&apos;s politics were. The Prime Minister also made the some-what astonishing remark that when he realised the appalling consequence for canada of Colonel Ralston&apos;s resignation he took great care to ask one colleagueafter the other whether he would take the responsibility of becoming PrimeMinister, but that none of them was prepared to do so.14.   The Prime Minister then dealt with what he referred to as CrisisNo. 2, culminating in the Order in Council.   Speaking of General McNaughton&apos;efforts to secure the reinforcements by voluntary means he said that many ofthe military officers throughout the country had tried to get voluntary enlist-ments, but that he also believed that some of them had not, and he referred tothe &quot; organised effort&quot; to force conscription which had been made.   He admitted that on the day of the opening of Parliament he had thought that the publicappeal for volunteers would succeed.   But that day General McNaughton had come to the conclusion that it might be taking too great a chance not to actimmediately.   The Prime Minister added &quot; that presentation was made to theGovernment, and with it I made a passionate appeal to every one of my colleaguesnot to press for any extreme position; to be as united as they possibly could;yielding up the extreme decision whether it was for all-out conscription orwhether it was for no conscription.&quot;  Speaking more generally, the Prime ministers aid that, unless the House could unite in a reasonable measure to support an administration that could carry on at this time of the war, the possibility ofanarchy in Canada had to be faced.   In a final appeal for support of the resolu-tion, the Prime Minister said that the issue before the House was not the question
\S elof conscription, it was whether the present Government should continue to conductCanada&apos;s war effort. The Prime Minister turned first of all to his colleagues in the Cabinet and begged them, unless they were prepared to form anotherAdministration, to consider his position as Leader of the Liberal party. He thenturned to the Leaders of the Opposition parties and said that, unless they felt theycould present an alternative Government, they owed it to the present Administra-tion to support it. In conclusion, he spoke to his friends from the Province ofQuebec. He reminded the House that, but for the. French-Canadian people,Canada would not to-day be a part of the British Commonwealth; something,therefore, was owing on the part of the other Provinces to Quebec. But thepeople of Quebec looked upon overseas conscription as a symbol of dominationby the majority, and he hoped that his fellow Canadians would look at thataspect of it. But Mr. Mackenzie King denied that he was seeking to appeaseQuebec and justified his stand by quotations from Sir Wilfrid Laurier andMr. Lapointe.16. The Prime Minister said that the motion before the House did not askfor approval of the Order in Council; the motion did not ask for an unlimitedvote of confidence in the Government. The motion did ask, and asked only,whether members were prepared to support the Government in continuing tocarry on Canada&apos;s war effort. Finally, in a moving quotation from a speechby Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Mr. Mackenzie King said he wished to repeat these words as his own and for them to be remembered of him : &quot; If there is anything to which I have devoted my political life, it isto try to promote unity, harmony and amity between the diverse elements ofthis country. My friends can desert me, they can remove their confidencefrom me, they can withdraw the trust they have placed in my hands, butnever shall I deviate from that line of policy. Whatever may be the conse-quences, whether loss of prestige, loss of popularity, or loss of power, i feel that I am in the right, and I know that a time will come when everyman will render me full justice on that score.&quot;17. So ended an oratorical performance which had lasted for nearly threehours. The Prime Minister had covered every aspect of the situation and hadjustified his attitude by copious quotations from speeches made in the past.Whatever else it was, the speech was at -least a remarkable feat of enduranceand gave proof of the Prime Minister&apos;s own vigour and vitality on the eve ofhis 70th birthday. But it was more than that. Running through the wholeof the speech was the main thread that he had sought to preserve the unity of Canada. The Prime Minister was deeply concerned over the issues which had arisen and gave powerful expression to his plea for harmony. It has been hailedeven in the opposition press as one of the best in his career and a commentatorhas written &apos;&apos; with a sense of history strong upon him the Prime Minister foughtfor his political life .... it was a remarkable performance; at its best his effort was in the finest tradition of political oratory .... it may well be remembered ashis best appeal to the Commons/&apos;18. Following on the Prime Minister, Mr. Graydon (Progressive Conser-vative), the Leader of the Opposition, spoke in favour of full overseas conscriptionand introduced an amendment to the Prime Minister&apos;s motion to substitute thewords :&quot; This house is of the opinion that the Government has not made certain of adequate and continuous trained reinforcements by requiring all JST.R.M.A.personnel whether now or hereafter enrolled to serve in any theatre ofwar and has failed to assure equality of service and sacrifice.&quot;He was followed by Mr. Coldwell, the Leader of the C.C.F., who introduced a sub-amendment in the following terms :&quot; That all the words of the amendment after the word &apos; that&apos; in thefirst line thereof be struck out and the following substituted therefor :&apos; The following words be added to the motion : which in the opinionof this house requires the immediate removal of all distinctions betweendrafted and volunteer personnel, thus making the entire home defence army, available for reinforcements overseas, and requires further the total mobilisa-tion of all the resources of Canada, material and financial as well as human,to ensure a total war effort, adequate re-establishment of the members ofour fighting forces, and full employment after the war.&apos; &quot;The C.C.F. sub-amendment was, however, subsequently rilled out of order bythe Speaker.   The Social Credit Party also moved an amendment asking for
an unqualified assurance that adequate reinforcements would be sent at once and that all persons in any of Canada&apos;s Armed Services would be used in anytheatre of war in which they were required; the amendment went on also toput forward the Party&apos;s demands in connection with demobilisation and thepost-war. This amendment was also ruled out of order and the Social CreditParty have indicated since that they will support the Government. It shouldbe added that a French-Canadian Liberal member has since introduced an amend-ment declaring that the House will aid in the maintenance of an efficient war effort but that it does not approve of compulsory service overseas. This toowas ruled out of order by the speaker.19. The next day was devoted to a Secret Session when General McNaughtonagain attended and presumably gave information which he had not felt ableto disclose publicly. On the following day, the 29th November, Colonel Ralstonaddressed the House. He was at pains to correct certain wrong impressionswhich he felt the Prime Minister had given. In particular, he poured scornon the Prime Minister&apos;s confession that he had offered to resign and had askedwhether any of his colleagues would be prepared to lead the Government. &quot; ThePrime Minister in his speech,&quot; said Colonel Ralston, &quot; gave the impression that he was in genuine search for a successor. I want to say that nothing ofthe kind occurred .... He asked a purely hypothetical question.&quot; The doctrineenunciated by the Prime Minister, that &quot; unless men are prepared to back their policies by taking responsibility for their enactment and carrying them out, theyhave no right to leave a Ministry in circumstances where, as a consequenceof their action, the whole construction is almost certain to collapse,&quot; was ridiculed.To Colonel Ralston it seemed the strangest doctrine he had ever heard enunciatedin the House, &quot; If I were not respectful of the Prime Minister I would callit just plain nonsense.&quot; Speaking of his own position, Colonel Ralston said&quot; I neither felt nor feel any duty to take on responsibility for which I am con-vinced I am not suited.&quot; Colonel Ralston averred that the Administration asa whole, certain colleagues excepted, did not consider that the Government was bound by the Prime Ministers speech in 1942. He himself was more concernedthan anything else about the immediacy and urgency of the shortage of infantryreinforcements. He said that the unlikelihood of any possible campaign toproduce 15,000 trained infantrymen was well known and he therefore had reachedthe conclusion that overseas conscription was necessary at once. He castigatedthe Government for the delay and said bluntly that he felt that neither thePrime Minister nor the Minister of Defence recognised the necessity for thepromptness of action which was essential. He said that if action under theOrder in Council had been proposed while he was still a Minister undoubtedlyhe would have accepted it. But that certainly he would have registered the strongest protest possible against the half-hearted, piecemeal method adopted.Once the decision was taken to secure the service of N.R.M.A. men, that decision should not apply to any one group but should apply to the force as a whole;to apply it just to part of the force was to perpetuate the system of two differentarmies. Colonel Ralston, himself, was far from satisfied with the delay whichhad occurred, far from satisfied with the piecemeal method that had been adopted,but he was determined that neither his dissatisfaction, nor any objections were going to deflect him into doing anything which might in the slightest delayfurther the sending forward of these reinforcements. If the Government were defeated, the sending of the needed reinforcements might be jeopardised. Forthat reason Colonel Ralston would vote for the Government, but he warnedsternly that he would hold the Government, and particularly the Prime Ministerand Minister for National Defence, to strict account for carrying out vigorouslyand without wavering their declared intention to reinforce the Army with well-trained men from the N.R.MA. to the fullest and fastest possible extent.20. It is not too much to say that Colonel Ralston held the fate of theGovernment in his hands. His statement was bitterly critical of the Governmentand his ridicule of the Prime Minister personally has done much to impairMr. Mackenzie King&apos;s already shaken reputation. But his determination to vote for the Government has virtually removed the possibility of any alternative tothe present Administration. The situation has been cruelly, but perhaps notunfairly, summed up in the words of ia press commentator : &quot; Layton Ralstonhas probably saved the Government, but he has damned it for ever.&quot;21. The discussion has since been taken up by the back benchers. The onlyspeech to which I need draw your special attention is perhaps that of Mr. Cardin,Liberal French-Canadian, who resigned from the Cabinet over the plebiscite issue in 1942.  Mr. Cardin, seizing on the wording of the Prime Ministers resolution,
said that &quot; its (i.e., the Governments) policy&quot; was a policy of conscription for service overseas. He maintained that all parties had agreed that this policy was no good for Canada, and he claimed that French-speaking Canadians had done more than English-speaking Canadians in the war : &quot; You have only obeyedthe call of blood What we have done could be done through reasoningand judging the situation .... Reverse the picture, if you please. Try toimagine Canada as part of a French Empire .... Can you tell me you wouldbe as enthusiastic in defending that Empire as would be the Canadians of Frenchdescent? &quot; He went on to ask what the English had ever done to preserve unitybetween the two races, and protested that all the concessions had been made by french-Canadians. He also referred to the &quot;extraordinary situation &quot; in which,after Colonel Ralston had left the Cabinet, there were still three or four members who shared his views and who were going to continue to press them. FinallyMr. Cardin claimed that Canada had tried to do too much for a country of hersize and population, and he urged that the extent of her activities should bereduced. He alleged that all the leaders of the Allied countries were thinking of their respective countries, and urged that Canada should imitate them andthink of Canada first of all and of the welfare and greatness of the land.22. The debate continues, but there seems little doubt but that the Govern-ment will now secure the necessary vote of confidence, however shaken theirreputation may be. I have not, therefore, delayed to send this report to your lordship until the final curtain has rung down on Parliament Hill. Such isthe chronicle of events which have taken place in Canada in the last few weeks.I apologise for wearying your. Lordship with so much detail, but this is inoutline the account of an episode in Canadian history which has brought thenational unity of Canada to the edge, though only to the edge, of an abyss. Ina subsequent despatch I shall hope to forward some broad comments on thatepisode and its significance for Canada generally.23. I am sending copies of this despatch to the United Kingdom Ambas-ambassador, Washington, and the United Kingdom High Commissioners at Canberra,Wellington and Pretoria.I have, &amp;c.MALCOLM MacDONALD.P.S. The special session of the House of Commons came to an end at a latehour last night after meeting for just over two weeks. The final day was one ofconsiderable confusion and the last few hours were spent by members in a succession of divisions upon a host of resolutions and amendments. I need notweary you with all the complications and it will suffice to give the voting on thethree main resolutions.On the first amendment, by Mr. Jean against conscription, the voting was as follows : for ...      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        45Against   ......      ...      ...      ...      ...      168On the Progressive Conservative amendment supporting conscription the voting was : For ......      ......      ......        44Against......      ............      1705 Liberals and 7 Social Credit members voted with the Opposition.When the voting on the Governments main motion took place, the tepidresolution was watered down still further by the Prime Minister accepting an amendment by Mr. Coldwell, the C.C.F. Leader, omitting the words &quot; its policy &quot;so that the Government motion read : &quot; the House will aid the Government in maintaining a vigorous war effort.&quot; This motion was carried by 143 to 70 votes.The C.C.F. and some members of the Social Credit party voted for the Govern-nient. The Opposition was composed of the Progressive Conservative party,certain Social Credit members and 40 defections from the Liberal party. with two exceptions (and these were French-Canadians) all the defections came fromQuebec; indeed, the only Quebec Liberals to vote with the Government were fourCabinet Ministers, two English-speaking members and one single French-speakingprivate member; Mr.. Fournier, the remaining Quebec Cabinet Minister, didnot cast his vote though he was&apos; present in the House.M. MacD.
