(W) 7646.29th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.BATTLESHIPS   VERSUS AIRCRAFT.Memorandum by the Paymaster-General.WHEN the Naval Construction Programme was discussed at the WarCabinet on the 18th May * I expressed the fear that in the long run battleshipswere bound to be outmatched by aircraft. It may be well to give an outline ofthe arguments which lead me to this view.t2. It is not my purpose here to open up the thorny question of the relativemerits of sea power and air power. For a long time to come it seems certain that trade will have to be very largely carried by the sea, and as long as this is trueit is likely that naval vessels will have an important part to play. What I amconcerned with is whether battleships will be able to hold their own againstaircraft attack; aircraft carriers, on which I shall touch later, are in a somewhat different category.3. The merit of the battleship is that, being sustained by water, it canbe made very heavy and therefore be surrounded by thick armour impervious to ordinary shells, without having the difficulties of suspension, transmission, &amp;c,which a tank of equal size would encounter on land. But modern weapons havemade these advantages largely illusory. When attack was to be expected only from shells with relatively flat trajectories, it was possible to protect the vitalparts of a battleship with 15 inches or so of armour on the sides. But nowadaysattack may come from any direction either bombs from above or torpedoes,B bombs and mines from underneath and this list will certainly be extended and improved. Hence immunity could only be secured by shielding the bottomand the deck as well as the sides. In a modern battleship the hull accounts for nearly one-third of the weight, the armour for nearly one-third more, leaving only just over one-third for engines, fuel, armament, ammunition, &amp;c. But if thedeck and the bottom were armoured as thickly as the sides, practically nothing would be left for machinery, guns, &amp;c. And even if such armour could be provided it would not give complete protection against modern forms of attack.4. Hitherto battleships have been designed mainly with a view to resistinggunfire, i.e., projectiles with sufficient velocity to pierce the armour, containing a small bursting charge fuzed to go off inside the ship and cause damage. Ido not know whether a modern battleship can be sunk by gunfire, or what numberof effective hits by 15-inch shells are reckoned to be necessary to incapacitate her.She is nowadays in more danger from other forms of attack. Comparativelyrecently the advantages of detonating high explosive in contact with armour have become apparent, the punch which can be exerted in this way being at least tentimes as strong as that obtained by firing a shell from an ordinary gun or droppingan armour-piercing bomb from 30,000 feet.   It has already been shown that* W.M. (44) 65th Conclusions, Minute 4.f Since this paper was written, the sinking of the Tirpitz has shown that with comparativelylight loss an &quot; unsinkable &quot; modern battleship could be sunk by aircraft in spite of heavy shoreprotection with bombs of normal design and using existing bombsights. In all it seems thatout of 17 battleships sunk in operations in this war, 10J have been sunk by air action (countingthe Bismarck and 4 Japanese battleships as having been sunk half by air and half bv surfaceaction).[28294] B
plastic charges are deadly against armoured decks and shaped charges can bemade dealing with marine forms of spaced armour like the blister. And we areonly at the beginning of this technique.5. There are many weapons in existence to-day by which projectiles of this type and of appropriate size and shape can be brought to bear upon the battleship.The old fashioned torpedo can still be very deadly if it explodes under the ship&apos;sbottom. And although it would be undesirable to describe them it should be recalled that at least four other aircraft weapons capable of doing lethal under-water damage have already been developed.From above, the battleship will always be exposed to attack by aerial bombs.Even without any additional motive power, the striking velocity of a bomb fallingfrom a reasonable height will suffice to give the required penetration, especially if the principle described above of detonating H.E. in contact with the armouris employed. And the destructive power of bombs is always increasing. We&apos;must remember that any battleship laid down to-day will have to resist the vastlyimproved bombs likely to be designed in the next 10 or 20 years.6. It is sometimes hoped that a battleship of cellular construction could be built which could not be sunk by bombs. This might be true if only standardarmour-piercing bombs or high-capacity blast bombs bursting outside the shipwere in question. But recent experiments seem to show that medium capacitybombs bursting on the main armoured deck would crumple much of the upperstrength deck, destroying the longitudinal girder strength and bending the whole structure. Model tests, which, as is well-known, give extremely accurate resultswith explosives, should be made to clarify the point.But even if it should turn out that the hull did not sink, the question wouldbe by no means settled; for the mere fact that the battleship was still afloatwould be scant consolation if its radar and fire-control had been destroyed by aircraft attack so that its guns, even if they could still be trained, could not hittheir targets.7. Besides passive defence by heavy armour, the battleship has the advan-tage that it can carry an enormously greater quantity of ammunition than theaircraft; moreover, it can be heavily escorted if required. Against this it must always be a much larger target to home on or to hit; it is confined to sea level andhandicapped in speed. And gravity, which helps the bombers, must alwaysimpede the gunner.Hitherto, of course, the hope has been that the battleship or its attendantscreen could prevent aircraft approaching near enough to use their lethal weapons.Secondary armament prevents the torpedo boat from coming within range; the destroyer screen is an answer to the U-boat; minesweepers and paravanes havecountered the mine. Anti-aircraft fire may be able to keep aircraft intending to launch, e.g:, torpedoes outside lethal range; although this will not be possible with aircraft launching, e.g., glider bombs,-it might be possible occasionally, givensufficient light armament, to destroy some of these missiles before they reach the target. But none of these answers are likely to be effective against aircraft which will in future be able to bomb from 30,000-40,000 feet or even higher.The only reply to these would be the destruction of the aircraft before theycould launch their bombs.8. In high level bombing hitherto the proportion of hits on ships has been small. Even in perfect weather conditions only very highly skilled crews canachieve one hit in 20 from 15,000 feet on a battleship. Indeed, to make certain of a hit on a capital ship to-day would entail flying so low that very heavy losseswould be incurred.9. But a new era is opening in high-level bombing. It is now more thana year since the first radio-controlled bombs appeared in operations. The limitedsuccess which the Germans achieved with these weapons should not blind usto their importance in the near future : recent trials of American bombs of this type have shown errors measured in scores of feet in range and very much lessin line. These guided missiles to-day still require good visibility. In low cloud,smoke, or under cover of night when the bomb-aimer cannot see the targetsufficiently clearly to be able to guide his bombs on to it, the battleship still enjoyssome degree of immunity. But this will not last for long, since television orradar will no doubt soon replace ordinary vision. Moreover, remarkable progress has already been made with the homing bomb. In America heat homing, inwhich the bomb is automatically guided towards the target by the heat energyradiated from it or reflected by it from the sky, has shown great promise; and,
although not quite impossible, it will be difficult to mislead this type of bomb bydecoys, owing to the large amount of heat involved. Homing by radar is also not far off, and when fully developed this method should ensure that a hit is obtained with a large proportion of the bombs dropped.* It is true that neitherheat nor raclar homing is likely to be effective against a ship in harbour, butthe bomb-aimer should be able to pick out his target from its surroundingsand successfully guide the weapon on to it in many cases once the television bomb, which can use either light or very short-wave radio, is developed.Furthermore, it will not be long before the limits within which homing bombsmust be dropped, in order to seek out their targets correctly, may have become sowide that only the roughest sort of aim will be needed. Evasive action will thennot handicap the aircraft whilst it will be futile for the ship. In the intervalthe development of blind-bombing devices will no doubt enable less advancedtypes of homing bomb to be used effectively in all conditions of visibility.10. Confronted with these weapons, the A.A. gunner on the battleship willhave a more difficult task than ever. For an increase in height does not very greatly augment bombing errors; but it accentuates disproportionately thedifficulty of hitting the aircraft. A target which can move in only two dimensionslike a battleship will in the nature of things be at a disadvantage against an aircraft which can move in three. Only two forms of error confront the bomber,longitudinal and lateral; the A.A. gunner has to cope with three elevation,bearing and range. Thus a contact fuze is all that is required against a ship;much more troublesome problems in fuze-setting must be solved when attackingan aeroplane. At first sight it might be claimed that this handicap, at any rate,is eliminated by the proximity fuze. But it will be very difficult to produce anyproximity fuze effective by day or by night, in clear or cloudy sky, which cannot be jammed or made to fire prematurely.11. Any projectiles fired at the aircraft must fight against the force ofgravity; the aircrafts bombs are aided by it. Unlike a bomb, a shell discharged from a gun has to be so strong that it can only contain a small proportion ofH.E., much of whose power is wasted in bursting the shell case. A rocketprojectile, on the other hand, must contain such a large proportion of fuel that.not much is left o*Ter for explosive.12. Clearly, the greater the distance the target can deviate in anunpredictable manner from its course&apos; in the interval between aiming theprojectile and its reaching its destination, the less the chance of securing a hit.This of course puts a very great premium on speed. Unlike the battleship, or forthat matter the airship, the aeroplane does not float but has to maintain itsheight dynamically. This struggle against gravity consumes something likeone-half of its horse-power; and nearly one-half of what is left is used up incooling the engine, skin friction, &amp;c. But, as regards speed, this handicap will always be more than compensated by the fact that the. air through which theaircraft moves is, at ground level, about 800 times lighter than sea-water, and at25,000 feet 2,000 times lighter. Since the speed, other things being equal, is roughly inversely proportional to the cube root of the density of the mediumthrough which a vessel has to move, the aircraft will always start with a factor of advantage in speed of 6 to 8 compared with a ship.A bomb dropped from 40,000 feet takes something like 50 seconds to reachsea-level and, if a tachometric bombsight is used, must be aimed on the basis ofinformation obtained .about 10 seconds prior to release, making a total interval of about 60 seconds. During this time the battleship, even if the helm is put hardover at full speed, will only deviate about 400 yards from the position it wouldhave reached had it continued straight. The aircraft need only fly straightduring its run-up, and since this requires about the same time (25 to 30 seconds)as the AA. fire-control calculation, the best-aimed fire will be that computedduring the run-up. But even in this case the aircraft will be able to take avoidingaction during the 25 seconds that the shell takes to reach it and may easily be over 2 miles away from the burst in this time.   All earlier and later salvoes from* A homing bomb cannot be jammed from a battleship since any signal given out by the target would only help the homer, to find its prey. It will be difficult to mislead it by Radardecoys of the Window type since the front object will always be the real target. An &quot;attemptmight be made to counter this by launching decoys ahead of the battleship, but as these wouldiave to be of a considerable size to simulate its Radar response probably at least as large asa pinnace the battleship could be teased into dispe rsing its entire stock of decoys by a number ofdummy runs before the real attack was made.[28294] b 2
the battleship will have even less chance of hitting. These figures illustrateclearly how very much easier it must always be to hit a&apos; slow-moving target fromthe air than to hit a fast-moving target from the ground.13. It is sometimes supposed that these arguments do not apply so forciblyin the case of a homing missile. But once again the disadvantage of the battle-ship is patent. A correction of a few hundred yards to take account of the battleship&apos;s avoiding action would be feasible. It would be almost impossible tomake corrections measured in miles such as would be necessary to follow an aircraft&apos;:s erratic course. In any event, unless the homing projectile has a verygreat advantage in speed, its curve of pursuit rapidly becomes extremelyunfavourable. If, instead of homing, the projectile were guided by a split radarbeam locked on to the target as has been proposed, there would always be a chance of jamming, quite apart from difficulties from decoys of the Windowtype. Even if all the technical difficulties of such a project were overcome- -andthere are many that have not been mentioned what hope has the battleship ofcoping with dozens or even scores of aircraft by this means? There will, after all, only be room for a limited number of such equipments on any one vessel.14. . It is. of course, intended in the modern naval plan that each battleshipshould be accompanied at sea by one or two carriers whose fighters are expected todefend it against hostile aircraft. The degree of success which such fighters willhave may be disputed. Some hold that the clay will come when fleets of heavilyarmed bombers will be able to hold their own against fighters no matter how muchswifter and handier fighters may be. Against this it may be said that eventhe heavily armed American bombers have had to rely upon the protection of a fighter escort for their forays into Germany. The argument is here apt to shiftto the question whether the handicap on the long-range escorting fighter of having to carry more petrol will or will not be outweighed by the restricted take-off and landing space available to a fighter operating from a carrier.These disputes appear to be otiose for two reasons. In the first place it seems certain that even though the carriers&apos; fighters were able to shoot downan appreciable proportion ox the attacking bombers there would be no hope of&quot;their destroying all of them, especially at night. But so long,as the bomber hasa good chance of sinking the- battleship or for that matter the carrier, the merefact that some of the attacking planes have been destroyed will not bringimmunity. The effort necessary to sink the battleship or carrier will be increased,but it is scarcely conceivable that the vessel would survive a determined assault.15. Then there is the matter of man-power and cost. The crew ofa battleship is at least 100 times greater than the crew of an aircraft ;* the costis of the order of 100 times the cost of a heavy bomber. It is true that in thepast battleships have become obsolete much slower than bombers, so that thecapital cost of building and maintaining a navy will form a smaller proportionof the total than the cost of building and maintaining a large air force. Never -theless, it seems clear that, even if bomber and battleship stood an equal chanceof destroying one another, a great many bombers could economically be sacrificedif necessary in order to sink one battleship and the chances, as has been shown, -are by no means equal.16. The final question which arises is, what is the object of having abattleship at all if it always has to be escorted by a carrier? What is therewhich a battleship can do which the carrier cannot? We may be told that itcan sink a carrier if it gets within gun range, but it should always be possibleto make more lightly armoured carriers faster than heavily armoured battleships.A well-handled carrier, therefore, equipped with modern Radar, &amp;c, should always be able to avoid a battleship&apos;s guns; but the battleship would not be ableto avoid the carrier&apos;s planes. Recent experience in the Pacific seems to confirm that the battleship is in more danger from the carrier than vice versa.It is, I&quot; believe, held that the principal reason for maintaining a battle-ship force is to neutralise the capital ships of the enemy. If this can be accomplished more certainly or at less cost by any other means, then the case for the battleship becomes largely a matter of sentiment. In this war the Germancapital ships have been neutralised in home waters more surely and economically* It might be held that we should count all the ground staff required to keep a heavy bomberin the air and not merely the crew. In this case we ought equally to reckon all the naval personnel and the ancillary services protecting and maintaining the battleship. Either way the argument would not be greatly affected.
GOby our bombers than by our own battleships. Even though there may remain forsome years one or two mid-ocean areas beyond the reach of shore-based aircraft in which battleships may be able to find sanctuary and rule the roost, these willshrink as the range of the heavy bomber increases, as it surely will.* Battle-ships used to dominate the situation outside the range of coast artillery, thatis to say, over three-quarters of the globe. If they can only survive at seaoutside the range of land-based bombers, they may become a liability instead ofan asset.It has also been suggested that in bad weather the carrier&apos;s planesand for that matter land-based aircraft cannot operate, and that in thesecircumstances the battleship recovers its old preponderance. The whole historyof flying is, however, a story of increasing mastery over the weather.Navigational aids, de-icing equipment and new landing technique enable the modern bomber to fly and find its target in conditions that would have beenjudged impossible a few years ago. It is significant that British heavy bombersorties per bomber in squadrons doubled in the period between 1940-1 and 1943-4,not only in the summer but also in the winter months.17. No attempt has been made in this note to peer beyond the recognisedscientific horizon. Only well-known lines of development have been consideredwhose feasibility oannot be gainsaid. But the case does not rest upon the useof any particular devices. The handicaps of the battleship are fundamentaland inevitable. Its main advantage is its heavy armour. All militaryhistory has surely shown that the ability to strike blows is more important thanthe power to survive them. In the struggle for existence, the tortoise has achievedbut a relatively humble niche; it is only in fable that it carries off the prize.18. For the sake of brevity, the arguments in this paper have been couched in unduly dogmatic form. It may well be that there are complete answers tothem. But if so, it would seem desirable that they be given before the country is committed irrevocably to heavy expenditure on battleships. At the very leastconclusive trials should be carried out on models of projected ships by independent bomb experts, who could give a realistic estimate of the strength ofthese ships under bombardment. Quite a separate question is whether there aretasks of great importance likely to be fulfilled by battleships in years to comewhich could not be carried out at less cost in manpower and money by any other means. This also would have to be answered before we should be justified inundertaking a great battleship programme which cannot come to fruition formany vears.C.Great George Street, S.W. 1,29th December, 1944.* The attack on the Tirpitz was carried out at a range of 1,200 miles. And bombers arenow being designed which will be capable of dropping 12,000-lb. bombs at very much greaterranges.
