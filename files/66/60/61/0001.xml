THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted -for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.TOP secret copy... Wo.W.P. (45) 44.20th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.ROCKET TARGETS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister oe Home Security.I think I should put on record for ray colleagues some of the considera-tions I had in mind when I raised in Cabinet on the 15th January * the questionof offensive action against rockets.On the 22nd December, I submitted a memorandum (Annex A) forconsideration by the Chiefs of Staff.   Their comments are set out in Annex B.At that time, I thought it better not to press the matter further, in view ofthe urgent calls on our bomber strength to cope with the Ardennes offensive. ButI feel obliged to bring it before my colleagues now. when more bombing strength is being made available for other targets, and since the rocket attack has increased in volume and in effectiveness.In the last fortnight the performance of the rocket has improved noticeably;and while there were only 23 incidents in Great Britain in the week ending the23rd December, and 22 in the week ending the 30th December, there were 56 inthe week ending the 6th January and 54 in the week ending the 13th January.It is true that we have been very fortunate in the fall of rockets, but wecannot rely on good fortune. The most serious incidents have been in the NewCross Road on the 25th November when 160 people were killed, in Islington onthe 26th December when 68 were killed, and in Lambeth on the 4th January when41 were killed. The possibilities have been much more serious. One rocket fellon a children&apos;s school one day before the holidays ended. If it had fallen one day later, 300 children would in all probability have been killed or injured.One fell just behind a &quot;crowded theatre; a few yards away, and several hundredpeople might have been killed. To avoid a still greater disaster we are delayingtwenty-five thousand passengers in the tubes several times a day. Any day a major disaster may occur.Londoners are in no state of panic, but there is a noticeable increase in the tension and strain inevitable after five years of war; and that tension and strainwill increase rapidly if the enemy continues to increase the number of rocketsfired and the proportion falling in the built-up areas of London. From &apos;&apos; Cross-bow &quot; Committee discussions, it seems that we might receive^in present conditionsup to 120 rockets a week, of which 90 will fall in London, though somethingnearer the present rate is much more probable.I therefore ask that anxious attention should be given to all possible counter-measures. I gather that the Air Staff and S.H.A.E.F. consider an attempt atthe complete &quot; interdiction&quot; of rocket supplies to the Hague area unjustifiedin present circumstances. But shall we be ready if circumstances change? Iam told that heavy bombing in the Hague area would cost too many Dutch lives.Are there not some individual targets in that area or near it which could witha fair degree of safety receive more bombs than the trifling tonnage so fardevoted to them ?  Fighter Command have made good use of the resources at their* W.M. (45) 6th Conclusions, Minute 2.[29077]
disposal, but, in some 700 daylight sorties, they &quot;have only been able to drop80 tons of bombs. They have no Mosquito bomber squadrons, which could carryheavier loads, and which could be used by night as well as by day.There are other targets besides these. More intensive and continuous attackscould be made against the communications with the launching areas withoutattempting the complete destruction of all communications between NorthernGermany and Holland. Oxygen plants have been located, but not yet attacked.There is doubt as to the effectiveness of attacks on the main assembly plant; i suggest this can best be resolved by experiment.All this would reduce not only the attack on London, but that on Antwerptoo. As Minister of Home Security, however, my main consideration is the civilpopulation at home, and I am seriously perturbed as to the possible effect on them of a continuing series of incidents accompanied by heavy casualties. others of my colleagues may be perturbed about the effect on housing and on production.H. M.Home Office and Ministry of Home Security,Whitehall, S.W. 1,20th January, 1945.ANNEX A.CCS. (44) 1046 (O).22nd December, 1944.WAR CABINET.Chiefs of Staff Committee.&quot; CROSSBOW.&quot;OFFENSIVE ACTION AGAINST ROCKET TARGETS IN THEHAGUE AREA.Memorandum by Ministry of Home Security.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security has rioted with satis-faction the successes already attained by Fighter Command and the SecondTactical Air Force in reducing the scale of attack on this country from rocketsites in Holland. He observes, however, that up to the present there does notappear to have been any attack on these sites by heavy bombers.It would seem that it has now become possible to delimit with some accuracythe areas in Holland which the enemy uses for storage and launching of therockets directed against this country, and the areas appear to be comparatively small and compact. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security wouldlike the Chiefs of Staff to consider whether, having regard to the results alreadyobtained with a relatively light force, it would not be desirable to make a con-centrated mass attack with heavy bombers at the first convenient opportunity.Prima facie such an attack would still further reduce, if not eliminate for. aconsiderable period, the use of rockets against this country.The recent discussion in the Lord Presidents Committee of the proposalto close the under-river floodgates and so interrupt the London UndergroundRailway services, whenever there is Radar warning that a rocket has crossed thecoast, has drawn attention to certain other ^consequential precautions, includingthe removal of some thousands of shelterers from the Tube stations, which mayhave to be taken if the menace of rocket attack continues. These measures inthe aggregate constitute a disturbance of the life of the Metropolis and may leadto political embarrassments altogether disproportionate to the present admittedlymoderate scale of attack.
Homeless people who are now sleeping in-the underground tube stations,and many women and children living in their vicinity will be forced to go furtherafield and, whatever alternative accommodation may be found, it remains apossibility that the displacement will give rise to speculation as to the safety of the whole underground railway system and the possibility of an increased scale of rocket attack. And if the enemy gets to know, it will provide him with an incentive to increase his attack.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security does not underestimatethe importance of subtracting nothing from the maximum effort that heavybombing can bring to bear upon the enemy. He is not asking that any continuoususe of heavy bombers should be made against the rocket targets used for the bombardment of England. He notes that the Air Staff regard the presentmodest scale of attack as adversely affecting the morale of the German regimentsconcerned, not merely those employed at any particular site. Accordingly he suggests that, even from the point of view of reducing rocket attacks againstAllied Forces on the Continent,, there would be at any rate indirect value inannihilating those sites and appliances which are used against this country.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,22nd December, 1944.ANNEX B.Copy of Minute (CCS. 2079/4) dated 23rd December, 1944, fromGeneral Ism ay to the Prime Minister.THE Chiefs of Staff have considered the attached memorandum by theMinistry of Home Security (CCS. (44) 1046 (O)) suggesting concentrated massattacks with heavy bombers on rocket installations in Holland. Their views areas follows : &apos;2. The rocket storage and fuel storage sites, and still more so the firingsites, are small compact targets distributed through a densely inhabited area.3.   There are two possible methods ,of destroying such targets : (a) to pick them off by precision bombing with individual aircraft;(b) to &quot; plaster &quot; them with a strong force of heavy bombers.The method at present in use is (a) above. The Minister of Home Securitysuggests the adoption of (b).4. In order to be sure of hitting one of these targets a bomb density ofabout 5 hits to the acre is necessary. This would involve a force of about150 Lancasters and the spread of the bomb pattern would cover a circle of about1,200 yards in radius. Within a 600-yard radius there would be almost completedevastation; from 6-1,260 yards there would be very severe damage, and a numberof bombs would fall still further from the target.5. A glance at the. large-scale map of the target area shows that greatdamage to life and property would result from each attack. It is true that the attacks might interrupt the use of the area for the discharge of rockets but nothing more than interruption could be expected. If determined to maintain their offensive, the Germans could reconstruct tJhe firing points or providealternative ones arid make improvised storage arrangements.6. To sum up, from the military viewpoint the employment of heavy bombers against the 8 to 10 known or suspected targets would involve the diversion of some 12-1,500 Lancaster sorties from urgent tasks connected withthe campaign on the Continent to counter small-scale rocket attacks whoseresults are of no military importance. Politically, whilst the employment of heavy bombers might be expected to achieve a temporary interruption of therocket attacks on this country, this would be achieved only at the expense of heavy loss of life and property among the Dutch. v7. The Chiefs of Staff therefore strongly recommend that heavy bombersshould not be employed, to attack rocket installations in Holland, but that presentefforts to destroy them ,by precision bombing with individual aircraft should be intensified.8.   A copy of this minute has been sent to the Minister of Home Security.
