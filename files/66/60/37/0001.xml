THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 20.11th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.PREPARATION OF  THE BUSINESS  VOTERS&apos;   REGISTER.Memorandum by Lord Privy Seal.UNDER the Parliament (Elections and Meetings) Act, 1943, it was madecompulsory on business voters to apply for and fill in a form before they can beincluded in the business premises register.This provision was strongly assailed in the Committee stage of the Bill inthe House of Commons. And an amendment making it compulsory on the registration Officer to draw the attention of business voters to this new obligationimposed on them by sending them copies of the form they are required to fill in,wias defeated only by 146 votes to 112.It was admitted on behalf of the Government during this debate that thoseentitled to the business vote ought to be given every facility for exercising it.But it was maintained that the responsibility for registration must be placed onthe business voter in order to lessen the exceptional burdens placed on the staffs of Local Authorities by the difficulties of holding an election under the war-timeprocedure of a continuing register.The War Cabinet has, however, now decided to abandon the continuingregister in favour of a fixed register to be frozen in the first instance at the31st January, 1945. And provision is made for this in the Representation ofthe People Bill now before the House of Commons.In consequence the only justification put forward in 1943 for compellingthe business voter to apply for and fill in a registration form has been removed.This discrimination against the business voter was in any event alwaysunjust. If he is entitled to vote at all he has just as much right to have a register prepared for him as any other voter.Provision should therefore now be made, by way of an amendment to thepresent Representation of the People Bill, to restore the right of the businessvoter to have the register prepared for him.BGwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W.1.11th January, 1945.[29012]
