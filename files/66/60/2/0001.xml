THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 752.l$th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.COMMONWEALTH CONVERSATIONS IN MONTREAL.Memorandum by the Minister for Civil Aviation&apos;.AT the invitation of the Canadian Government, all the CommonwealthDelegations to the Chicago Conference met at Montreal on the 9th and10th December., 2. The establishment of a Commonwealth Air Transport Council was agreed and an announcement was issued to the Press that the Council would hold its first meeting in the near future. A full statement of the composition and functions, &amp;c, of the Council was agreed, subject to approval by the Governmentsconcerned (Appendix &quot;A&quot;). As all the representatives present were in full agreement, the approval can, I think, be treated as formal. But we cannotpublish the text until the approval has been received.3. It will be seen that the Council proposes to establish a permanentSecretariat. For the time being the Civil Aviation Department in London will act as a focal point for Council business. The Montreal Conference also adopted a suggestion I made that, pending the appointment of officers from any of theDominions to the Secretariat, an officer in each High Commissioners office should be detailed to maintain liaison with the acting Secretariat in the CivilAviation Department.4. The Commonwealth Delegations at Chicago had discussed the desirabilityof having standard clauses in bilateral agreements on the lines of the &quot; BritishPlan.&quot; I was asked to prepare these clauses. I attach (Appendix &quot; B &quot;) draftstandard clauses which I submitted at Montreal and which I shall discuss further with the Commonwealth representatives in London this week. I also attach(Appendix &quot; C &quot;) the United Nations Clause which was put forward by theBritish Delegation, and which Commonwealth countries will no doubt includeas it suits them in any bilateral agreement with the United States.5. We also discussed at Montreal the arrangements for the operation of trans-Pacific services, and a provisional agreement was reached, which is set outin Appendix &quot; D.&quot; It will be seen that, subject to satisfactory arrangements being made with the United States, Canada has abandoned her claim to run asectional service and has agreed to parallel operation along the whole route.6. Outside the Conference the Canadian representatives raised two questions : (a) A Canadian service across the United States to the West Indies,probably continuing to South America. The Canadian Governmentsaid that, while they wished to run such a service, they would not beprepared to do so if the West Indies insisted on running a reciprocalservice, as there would not be enough traffic to support two services.I explained that this must be a matter for discussion with theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Colonial Governments.Mr. Howe said he thought the Colonial Governments would beagreeable and that he would put forward a proposal for discussion in the first place with the Colonial Office.[28868] , B
(b) The Canadian representatives said that T.C.A. wished to charge faresas soon as possible on their trans-Atlantic service. Mr. Howe wasunder the impression that we had agreed to the American proposal that the U.S.A.T.C. should charge fares for commercial passages. explained that this matter was still under discussion, and the canadians agreed to withdraw their claim for the time being. They )made it clear, however, that they would renew this claim if theAmerican Transport Command began to charge fares for commercialpassages.S.Office of the Minister for Civil A aviation,19th December, 1944.APPENDIX &quot;A.&quot;Commonwealth Air Transport Council.1.

APPENDIX &quot; B.&quot;Standard Clauses.(United Kingdom Proposals.)It is agreed between the parties to this Agreement: Basic Capacity.(1) The capacity to be operated between the territories of the contractingparties shall be determined from time to time, on the basis of an agreed loadfactor, in relation to the traffic embarked in the territory of each for the territory of the other.Division of Capacity.(2) The capacity determined as aforesaid shall normally be regarded asequally divisible between the two parties, but the proportion operated by each party may be varied by agreement between them, so, however, that the totalcapacity determined in accordance with clause (1) is not exceeded.Capacity for Onward Destinations.(3) Capacity on the services of one contracting party proceeding beyond theterritory of the other contracting party will be assessed in relation to the capacity&apos;necessary to convey traffic embarked in the territory of the former for onwarddestinations on the route. The capacity so assessed may be operated,between the territories of the two contracting parties in addition to the capacity determined under clause (1).Traffic originating in other States.(4) Where a claim is made for the conveyance of traffic additional to the traffic embarked in the State of origin of the aircraft either (i) Because such additional traffic is necessary to enable the through air lineon whose behalf the claim is made to operate with economy itsauthorised capacity under clauses (1) and (3); or -(ii) Because additional capacity on the through services operating along the route is necessary to meet requirements for air transportation whichare not otherwise provided for;the following procedure shall be followed : The contracting parties will enter into consultation with the other states concerned in order to determine what adjustments of capacity, if any, shouldbe made at the appropriate stages on the route. Such adjustments shall be governed by (a) The capacity determined in accordance with clauses (1) and (3).(b) The air transport needs of the State through which the route passes,judged in relation to public convenience and necessity.(c) The adequacy of regional and local air transport development.id) The economy of through air line operation.If the States are unable to reach agreement, the contracting parties, asbetween themselves, agree to refer the matter to arbitration as hereinafter provided.Tariffs.(5) Tariffs will be fixed at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant factors including economical operation, reasonable profit, differentials in rates in relation to differences of characteristics of service, including standards of speed and accommodation, and tariffs charged by any other operators on the route. Tariffs charged for traffic taken up on a route, other than traffic embarkedin or destined for the State of origin of the aircraft, shall be higher than thecorresponding tariffs charged for similar traffic carried by local or regionalservices on the corresponding sector of the route. Tariffs will be settled, in thefirst instance, between the air lines operating the service under this agreement and other air lines operating on the route or any section thereof. Any tariffs soagreed will be subject to the approval of the contracting parties. In the event[28868] ,  , b 2
of disagreement between the air lines, the contracting parties themselves shallendeavour to reach agreement. Should the contracting parties fail to agree, thematter in dispute will be referred to arbitration as hereinafter provided.A rbitration.(6) Any matter in dispute under this Agreement, whether of interpretationor of application, shall be referred for decision, either to the Interim Council inaccordance with the provisions of Article of the Interim Agreement, or toah Arbitral Tribunal appointed by agreement between the parties, whicheverprocedure the parties shall agree to adopt.

Where two or more States are currently operating such competitiveroutes, the amount of such reductions among the services shall be proportionate to the traffic then carried by them; provided that any such member of the united nations shall have no rights under this Article after three years from the datedetermined by the Board to be the date of cessation of active hostilities withGermany for all member States entitled thereunder other than Australia,New Zealand and members of the United Nations located in Asia; and in their case the period shall be three years from the date of cessation of active hostilities with Japan.APPENDIX  &quot;D.&quot;Arrangements for Operation of Trans-Pacific Services.Mr. HOWE presided over a meeting this evening (9th December, 1944),which was attended by representatives of Canada, Australia, New Zealand andthe United Kingdom, to discuss arrangements for securing co-operation betweenthe four countries in the operation of Trans-Pacific services between north america and Australia and New Zealand. Mr. Howe stated his willingness toconsider either (a) a Canadian Operation between Vancouver and Honolulu linkingwith a joint organisation operating from Australia and New Zealand toSan Francisco, or (&amp;) a Canadian operation in parallel with a joint organisationoperation throughout the route via San Francisco. The feasibility of the latteralternative would be dependent on. United States agreement with Australia andNew Zealand that^both operating organisations would share commercial rights at San Francisco.A preference for parallel but not competitive operations was expressed. Itwas accordingly agreed that, subject to satisfactory arrangements with the UnitedStates on this matter, the following possible basis of operations should be further examined : 1(1) That T.C.A. and a joint organisation, comprising the interests of. Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, would operate in parallel throughout the route between Canada and Australia andNew Zealand.
(2) That the operations of the two organisations would be under independentmanagement, but fully co-ordinated.(3) The services would operate via San Francisco, provided that satisfactory arrangements could be made with the United States for T.C.A. to share in the traffic which Australia and New Zealand could claimreciprocally for traffic between the United States and those countries.(4) The traffic on the route would be pooled.(5) Receipts would be pooled on a mutually satisfactory basis through the medium of an operators&apos; agreement.(6) Each operating organisation would bear its own expenses and its owndeficits on operation.(7) Each country would be responsible for maintaining the ground organisa-tion in its own territory, and maintenance facilities would be provided on a basis of common user.The arrangements for the formation of a joint organisation, comprising theinterests of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, were left over for later discussion between the representatives of the three countries.If the Governments approve, and if arrangements can be made with theUnited States, alternative (b) will be adopted, otherwise (a) will be adopted.
