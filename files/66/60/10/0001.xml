A.22nd December, 1944.APPENDIX I. 1Extract from King Edward&apos;s Proclamation 1908.&quot;It is now fifty years since Queen Victoria, my beloved mother, and myAugust Predecessor on the throne of these realms, for divers weighty reasons,with the advice and consent of Parliament, took upon herself the government ofthe territories theretofore administered by the East India Company. I deem this a fitting anniversary on which to greet the Princes and Peoples of India, incommemoration of the exalted task then solemnly undertaken. Half a centuryis but a brief span in your long annals, yet this half-century that ends to-day will stand amid the floods of your historic ages, a far-shining landmark. The proclamation-mation of the direct supremacy of the Crown sealed the unity of . indian government and opened a new era. The journey was arduous, and the advancemay have sometimes seemed slow; but the incorporation of many strangelydiversified communities, and of some three hundred millions of the human race,under British guidance and control has proceeded steadfastly and without pause.We survey our labours of the past half-century with clear gaze and goodconscience.&apos;&apos; Steps are being continuously taken towards obliterating distinctions of race Abolition of as the test for access to posts of public authority and power.    In this path I distinctionconfidently expect and intend the progress henceforward to be steadfast and sure, of race&apos;as education spreads, experience ripens, and the lessons of responsibility are well-learned by the keen intelligence and apt capabilities of India.From the first, the principle of representative institutions began to be Extension ofgradually introduced, and the time has come when, in the judgment of my the principle ofViceroy and Governor-General and others of my counsellors, that principle may bSo*Vebe prudently extended.   Important classes among you, representing ideas that have been fostered and encouraged by British rule, claim equality of citizenship,and a greater share in legislation and government.    The politic satisfaction ofsuch a claim will strengthen, not impair,  existing authority and power.Administration will be all the more efficient, if the officers who conduct it have greater opportunities of regular contact with those whom it affects, and withthose who influence and reflect common opinion about it..&quot;[28874]
The Montagu Declaration.Policy ofHis Majesty&apos;sGovernment-.Mr. Montagu&apos;Visit to india the measure and Pace ofConstitutionalAdvance.Extract from Announcement made by Mr. Montagu, Secretary of State for India,in the House of Commons on 20th August, 1917.&quot; The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, with which the Government ofIndia are in complete accord, is that of the increasing association of Indians inevery branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible governmentin India as an integral part of the British Empire. They have decided that substantial steps in this direction should be taken as soon as possible, and that itis of the highest importance as a preliminary to considering what these steps should be that there should be a free and informal exchange of opinion betweens those in authority at home and in India. His Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly decided, with His Majesty&apos;s approval, that I should accept theViceroy&apos;s (Lord Chelmsford&apos;s) invitation to proceed to India to discuss thesematters with the Viceroy and the Government of India, to consider with theViceroy the views of Local Governments, and to receive with him the suggestions of representative bodies and others.&quot; I would add that progress in this policy can only be achieved by successivestages. The British Government and the Government of India, on whom theresponsibility lies for the welfare and advancement of the Indian peoples, mustbe judges of the time and measure of each advance, and they must be guided bythe co-operation received from those upon whom new opportunities of service will thus be conferred and by the extent to which it is found that confidence can bereposed in their sense of responsibility.&quot;dominion status thenatural issue ofconstitutionalprogress.Extract from Statement issued by the Viceroy (Lord Irwiri) on 1st November,1929.The goal of British policy was stated in the declaration of August 1917(what is known as the &quot; Montagu declaration &quot;) to be that of providing for&quot;the gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to the pro-gressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of theBritish Empire.&quot; As I recently pointed out, my own Instrument of instructions from the King-Emperor expressly states that it is His Majesty&apos;s will andpleasure that the plans laid by Parliament in 1919 should be the means by which british India may attain its due place among His Dominions. Ministers of theCrown, moreover, have more than once publicly declared that it is the desire ofthe British Government that India should, in the fullness of time, take her placein the Empire in equal partnership -with the Dominions. But, in view of the doubts which have been expressed both in Great Britain and India regarding theinterpretation to be placed on the intentions of the British Government inenacting the Statute of 1919, I am authorised on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to state clearly that in their judgment it is implicit in the declaration of1917 that the natural issue of India&apos;s constitutional progress, as there contem-plated, is the attainment of Dominion status.&quot; In the full realisation of this policy, it is evidently important that theIndian States should be afforded an opportunity of finding their place, and evenif we cannot at present exactly foresee on what lines this development may beshaped, it is from every point of view desirable that whatever can be done shouldbe done to ensure that action taken now is not inconsistent with the attainment of the ultimate purpose which those, whether in British India or the States, wholook forward to some unity of All-India have in view.Extract from the Speech by the Secretary of State in the House of Commons,Qth February, 1935.   (2nd Reading of Government of India Bill.)Our policy, as will be seen from this Bill and the instructions as to themanner in which these provisions which will accompany it are to be applied, isto do all that we can by sympathetic help and co-operation to enable India to overcome these difficulties and ultimately to take her place among the fully self-governing members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
Extracts from the Instrument of Instructions to the Governor-General,8th March, 1937.VII. It is Our will and pleasure that Our Governor-General shall use allendeavour consistent with the fulfilment of his responsibilities to Us and to OurParliament for the welfare of Our Indian subjects, that the administration ofthe matters committed to the charge of Our Governor-General in Council maybe conducted, in harmony with the wishes of Our said subjects as expressed bytheir representatives in the Indian Legislature so far as the same shall appearto him to be just and reasonable; and shall so order the administration of hisgovernment as to further the policy of the Act for its conversion into a Federationof all India:XV. And generally Our Governor-General shall do all that in him lies tomaintain standards of good administration; to promote all measures making for moral, social and economic welfare and tending to fit all classes of thepopulation to take their due share in public life; and to secure amongst allclasses and creeds co-operation, goodwill and mutual respect for religious beliefsand sentiments; and he shall further have regard to this Instruction in theexercise of the powers by law conferred upon him in relation to matters whetherof legislation or of executive government.Extract from the Instrument of Instructions to Governors, 8th March, 1937.XX. And generally Our Governor shall do all that in him lies to maintainstandards of good administration; to promote all measures making for moral,social and economic welfare and tending to fit all classes of the population totake.their due share in the public life and government of the Province; and tosecure amongst all classes and creeds co-operation, goodwill and mutual respect for religious beliefs and sentiments; and he shall further have regard to thisInstruction in the exercise of the powers by law conferred upon him in relationto matters whether of legislation or of executive government.Extract from the Statement^ issued by the Governor-General on 8th August, 1940.There is still in certain quarters doubt as to the intentions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for the constitutional future of India, and there is doubt, too, asto whether the position of minorities, whether political or religious, is sufficientlysafeguarded in relation to any future constitutional change by assurancesalready given. There are two main points that have emerged. On those two points His Majesty&apos;s Government now&quot;desire me to make their position clear.The first is as to the position of minorities in relation to any future constitu-tional scheme. It has already been made clear that my declaration of last Octoberdoes not exclude examination of any part either of the Act of 1935, or of thepolicy and plans on which it is based. His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s concern that full weight should be given to the views of minorities in any revision has alsobeen brought out.   That remains the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government.It goes without saying that they could not contemplate transfer of theirpresent responsibilities for the peace and welfare of India to any system ofgovernment whose authority is directly denied by large and powerful elements in India&apos;s national life. Nor could they be parties to the coercion of such elementsinto submission to such a Government.The second point of general interest is the machinery for building withinthe British Commonwealth of Nations the new constitutional scheme when thetime comes. There has been very strong insistence that the framing of that scheme should be primarily the responsibility of Indians themselves, and shouldoriginate from Indian conceptions of the social, economic and political structure of Indian life. His Majesty&apos;s Government are in sympathy with that desire andwish to see it given the fullest practical expression, subject to the due fulfilment of the obligations which Great Britain&apos;s long connection with India has imposed on her and for which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot divest themselves ofresponsibility. It is clear that a moment when the Commonwealth is engagedin a struggle for existence is not one in which fundamental constitutional issuescan be decisively resolved. But His Majesty&apos;s Government authorise me to declare* This statement lias never been declared to be either abrogated or modified in any way&apos;[28874] P 2
that they will most readily assent to the setting up after the conclusion of thewar with the least possible delay of a body representative of the principal elements in India&apos;s national life in order to devise the framework of the new Constitution,and they will lend every aid in their power to hasten decisions on all relevantmatters to the utmost degree. Meanwhile they will welcome and promote in anyway possible every sincere and practical step that may be taken by representativeIndians themselves to reach a basis of friendly agreement, first upon the form which the post-war representative body should take and the methods by whichit should arrive at its conclusions, and secondly, upon the principles and outlinesof the Constitution itself. They trust, however, that for the period of the war(with the Central Government reconstituted and strengthened in the manner Ihave described, and with the help of the War Advisory Council) all parties,communities and interests will combine and co-operate in making a notable Indiancontribution to the victory of the world cause which is at stake. Moreover, they hope that in this process new bonds of union and understanding will emerge, andthus pave the way towards the attainment by India of that free and equalpartnership in the. British Commonwealth which remains the proclaimed and accepted goal of the Imperial Crown and of the British Parliament.APPENDIX II.The Cripps Offer and Government Statements after its WithdrawalDraft Declaration for Discussion with Indian Leaders, published30th March, 1942.The conclusions of the British War Cabinet as set out below are those which sir Stafford Cripps has taken with him for discussion with the Indian leaders and the question as to whether they will be implemented will depend upon the outcome of these discussions which are now.taking place.His Majesty&apos;s Government, having considered the anxieties expressed in thiscountry and in India as to the fulfilment of the promises made in regard tothe future of India, have decided to lay down in precise and clear terms the steps which they propose shall be taken for the earliest possible realisation ofself-government in India. The object is the creation of a new Indian union which shall constitute a Dominion, associated with the United Kingdom and theother Dominions by a common allegiance to the Crown,, but equal to them inevery respect, in no way subordinate in any respect of its domestic or external affairs.His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore make the following declaration : (a) Immediately upon the cessation of hostilities, steps shall be taken to setup in India, in the manner described hereafter, an elected bodycharged with the task of framing a new Constitution for India.(b) Provision shall be made, as set out below, for the participation of theIndian States in the constitution-making body.(c) His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake to accept and implement forth with the Constitution so framed subject only to- (i) the right of any. Province of British India that is not preparedto accept the new Constitution to retain its present constitu-tional position, provision being made for its subsequentaccession if it so decides.With such non-acceding Provinces, should they so desire, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to agree upon a newConstitution, giving them the same full status as Indian Union, and arrived at by a procedure analogous to that here laid down.(ii) the signing of a Treaty which shall be negotiated, between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the constitution-making body. this treaty will cover all necessary matters arising out of thecomplete transfer of responsibility from British to Indianhands; it will make provision, in accordance with the under-takings given by His Majesty&apos;s Government, for the protectionof racial and religious minorities;  but will not impose any
restriction on the power of the Indian Union to decide in thefuturelts relationship to the other Member States of the BritishC common wealth.Whether or not an Indian State elects to adhere to the Constitution,it will be necessary to negotiate a revision of its Treaty arrangements,so far as this may be required in the new situation.(d) the constitution-making body shall be composed as follows, unless theleaders of Indian opinion in the principal communities agree uponsome other form before the end of hostilities : &apos;Immediately upon the result being known of the provincialelections which will be necessary at the end of hostilites, the entiremembership of the Lower Houses of the Provincial Legislaturesshall, as a single electoral college, proceed to the election of theconstitution-making body by the system of proportional represen-tation. This new body shall be in number about one-tenth of thenumber of the electoral college.Indian States shall be invited to appoint representatives inthe same proportion to their total population as in the case of therepresentatives of British India as a. whole, and with the same powers as the British Indian members.(e) During the critical period which now faces India and until the newConstitution can be framed His Majesty&apos;s Government must inevitably bear the responsibility for and retain control arid directionof the defence of India as part of their world war effort, but the task of organising to the full the military, moral and material resources ofIndia must be the responsibility of the Government of India with theco-operation of the peoples of India. His Majesty&apos;s government desire and invite the immediate and effective participation of theleaders of the principal sections of the Indian people in the counselsof their country, of the Commonwealth and of the United Nations.Thus they will be enabled to give their active and constructive help inthe discharge of a task which is vital and essential for the futurefreedom of India.Sir Stafford Cripps, House of Commons, 28th April, 1942.&quot; I stated when I left India that, in default of acceptance, the draft declaration must be considered as withdrawn. But this does not and cannotclose the door to that closer co-operation which we desire to see in the defenceof India or to the solution of the problem of self-government after the war.It means that His Maj-esty&apos;s Government have done their best to make their contribution to the solution of the problem both in the substance of the draft declaration and in the method of its presentation to the Indian people.&quot;Secretary of State, House of Commons, 30th July, 1942.&quot; The purpose of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the constitutionalfuture of India was made clear in the draft Declaration which my right hon.and learned Friend the Lord Privy Seal was authorised to offer on behalf ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government. It proved impossible to secure the support of theprincipal elements of India&apos;s national life for the specific proposals in that declaration, and the draft was accordingly withdrawn. Nevertheless, HisMajesty&apos;s Government stand firmly by the broad intention of their offer.&quot;Prime Minister, House of Commons, 10th September, 1942.&quot; The broad principles of the declaration made by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment which formed the basis of the mission of the Lord Privy Seal to India,must be taken as representing the settled policy of the British Crown and Parlia-ment. These principles stand in their full scope and integrity. No one can addanything to them, and no one -can take anything away.Secretary of State, House of Commons, 11th September, 1942.&quot; It was not a bargaining policy which my right hon. and learned Friendtook with him; it was a considered policy, and it is the only policy under whicha final and permanent solution of the Indian problem can.be achieved.   Within
that broad framework we are only too glad to welcome any practical proposals that are brought forward with any reasonable hope of agreement among themain parties in India.&quot;Secretary of State, House of Commons, 8th October, 1942.   -&quot; That declaration offered to India complete and unqualified freedom, thesame freedom as is enjoyed by the Dominions, or for that matter by ourselves,&quot;the same unfettered control over her future destiny within the partnership ofthe British Commonwealth or without that partnership if she preferred to forgo its advantages-at the earliest possible moment after, the war under a constitution arrived at by free agreement and subject to fulfilment under treatyarrangements of our honourable obligations. What more could have been offered?That offer stands.   What more can we offer to-day 1Lord Chancellor, House of Lords, 20th October, 1942.&quot; I do say it is essential for the great Indian Parties and their leaders tomake some effort to get together to help to produce a&apos; scheme which would bebetter than the one we have proposed. Our own proposal is not cancelled. Itis there in its general outline to be worked at and, it may be, to be improved.&quot;Mr. A ttlee, House of Commons, 30th March, 1943.&quot;I do not think we ought even to encourage Indians to think that this isa decision that can be made by someone else. The responsibility is theirs. our first offer to them was made in dark days. It may have been suggested that itwas made because the days were dark, but we have reaffirmed that offer when our position is vastly improved and I suggest that it still holds the field as theonly practicable proposal that has been put up whereby all sections of indian opinion will be able to act together and frame their own constitution.&quot;Lord Wavell. Indian Legislature, 17th February, 1944.&quot; Nearly two years have passed since the Cripps draft Declaration was made public, but it stands forth to-day as the solemn pledge of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment that India shall have full control of her own destiny among the nations of the Commonwealth and of the world.&quot;Secretary of State, House of Commons, 18th April, 1944.&quot;... those very generous proposals (the Cripps proposals), proposals which,I might add, still stand, in what the Prime Minister described as their wholescope and integrity and are indeed still, as the Viceroy reminded the IndianAssembly only a few weeks ago, an essential part of the policy of the BritishGovernment.&quot;
