THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY/S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 33.15th January, 1945. -. MAR CABINET.REPATRIATION  OF  ABLE-BODIED  LONG-TERM  PRISONERS  OFWAR FROM THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH AND GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for War.THERE are in German hands about 40,000 British Commonwealth membersof the armed services and of the Merchant Navy who have been prisoners of warsince the 1st July, 1940. Reports received both by the Foreign Office and theWar Office indicate the increasingly harmful effects, both mental and physical,of this prolonged captivity. They point to the need of improving the morale of our prisoners so that they may brace themselves to resist the cumulative effects of their incarceration and to face the last phase of it and may fit themselves for playing their full part in the national life of their country after the war.It is considered that the repatriation of even a small percentage of the long-termmen would have a good effect in that direction not only among this categorybut also among those who have been in enemy hands for a shorter time.Furthermore, it is clear that the families of our long-term prisoners are suffering great distress and anxiety at the prolonged absence of these men andare becoming increasingly impatient. This state of affairs is reflected in thequestions asked in the House of Commons, by the volume of letters received onthis subject in the Foreign Office and War Office and by the eagerness of thePress to publish news regarding our prisoners. It is expected that the exchangeof sick and wounded, which is to take place later this month, will result in freshpublic pressure on the Government to do something for long-term prisoners,particularly now that it is known that our proposals for internment in a neutral country have met with no response from the German Government.2. There is no treaty obligation binding on the Germans and ourselves to exchange long-term prisoners, but Article 72 of the Geneva (Prisoners of War)Convention reads : &quot; During the continuance of hostilities, and for humanitarian reasons,belligerents may conclude agreements with a view to the direct repatriationor accommodation in a neutral country of prisoners of war in good health or who have been in captivity a long time.&quot;3. Until the summer of 1943, it had proved impossible to reach agreementwith the German Government as regards the exchange of sick and woundedprisoners, although this constitutes an obligation op both the Germans and ourselves under Article 68 of the Convention. It was, therefore, consideredinadvisable to broach .the question of ablerbodied long-term prisoners whoserelease could be sepured only by mutual agreement. In April 1944, Jiowever,an approach was made to the German government for the accommpdation of long-term prisoners in neutral territory. It was considered, on account of the disparity at that time in the numbers of long-term prisoners held on each side,that this course rather than direct repatriation would appeal to the Germans.Despite frequent reminders no reply from Germany has e-yer been received,, Welearn, however,&quot; from the Swiss, that the German authorities fear to expose theirmen to the facts about Germany and the war to be learnt from the Press andother sources in neutral countries. There now remains for consideration thealternative of direct repatriation.Copy No.12641   [29042]
4. A delegation composed of members of the War Office and Foreign Officerecently visited Switzerland, where they discussed with the Swiss authorities,amongst other matters, the prospects of bringing about an exchange of long-termprisoners. In the view of the Swiss, a proposal based on the following principlesstood some chance of acceptance :  (a) It must provide for direct repatriation, as the Germans would never agreeto internment in a neutral country.(6) It must be on a&quot; head for head basis.(c) Owing to the deterioration of German administration, the initiative must come from our side and the scheme must be administratively simple.Discussions have now taken place between the Foreign Office and War Office,and a proposal, based on those principles, has been drawn up. This has beenagreed on a departmental level by the Foreign Office and the War Office and will,after being cleared with the other departments concerned, be examined by sub--Committee A and the Imperial Prisoners of War Committee. The proposalforeshadows the exchange of 3,000 Germans (mainly soldiers) from those nowin the Middle East who were taken prisoner before the 1st July, 1943, against asimilar number of Commonwealth prisoners captured before the 1st July, 1940.The total of 3,000 persons and the repatriation of Germans from those in theMiddle East was decided in the light of the shipping situation. It is hoped that,,if agreement is reached with the Germans by March next, shipping space for the3,000 persons mentioned may be available. If this exchange succeeds, we would hope to organise further exchanges. The selection of those who are to be repatriated must be left to the Detaining Power. Our own Service authoritiesinsist on the exclusion of certain specialist categories such as U-boat crews, andno doubt the Germans would wish to do the same. The Protecting Power will be requested to ensure as far as possible that the three armed services and theMerchant Navy are fairly represented among the British repatriates, and alsothat certain simple priority standards in their selection, e.g., health, previouscaptivity,-age, are applied.5. It may be argued that, while the proposed exchange is in itself desirable,it would bring much greater advantage to Germany than to the Allies. in exhange for some 3,000 British prisoners whose health has been seriouslyimpaired by prolonged captivity in most unfavourable conditions, Germany, it willbe said, will recover a similar number of prisoners who, as a result of a shorterterm of captivity and of relatively better treatment at our hands, will be immediately available for the war effort. So far as the Prisoners of war convention is concerned the position is clear : Article 72 provides that norepatriated person shall be employed on active military service. While HisMajesty&apos;s Government will observe this provision, there is a risk that germany would not do so, even if she were to give a guarantee to that effect: Nevertheless,this risk must be accepted if any exchange is to take place. On the other hand,our own ex-prisoners may, once they are restored to health, be employed in theUnited Kingdom with administrative, training and non-operational units or,it is understood, after the defeat of Germany, on active military service against japan. There can be little doubt that a large proportion of them would, after a period of convalescence, be able to take up fresh employment. While, therefore,it is true that Germany would obtain an initial advantage from the point of viewof man-power, our own ex-prisoners would also at a later stage make a usefulcontribution.On balance it is considered that there are strong grounds for proceeding withthis proposal on the lines indicated in this paper. If the German Governmentaccepts it, the United States and Soviet Governments will be kept informed. TheUnited States Government should, it is suggested, be told at once what we intend to propose to the Germans, but we should await the German reply before informing the Soviet Government. The latter may perhaps raise objections, but it issuggested that we should not allow these objections to interfere with our decision.A. E.P. J. G.15th January, 1945.
