THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 36.17th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR CONTRIBUTION OF BRITISH AGRICULTURE TO the saving OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theMinister of Food.I. Introduction.jjen accordance with W.M. (44) 93rd Conclusions, Minute 2, Conclusion (7),when the War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, W.P. (44) 360 (Overseas Resources and Liabilities), we have considered  \(a) what &quot;savings in expenditure on imported food might be achieved afterthe war through increasing the output of British agriculture; and(b) to what extent might those -savings be added to, or (more probably)absorbed by, changes in the level of food consumption.2. The first part of this memorandum is concerned primarily with (a).Question (b) does not enter at this point, except that in considering what additional quantities and types of food might be produced by home agriculture,we have been guided by consumption needs. The estimates under (a) have beenmade by the Ministry of Agriculture. Like the estimates of food consumptionmade by the Ministry of Food, which are set out later, they are inevitablytentative and provisional; they are intended only to give an indication of theorder of magnitude of the savings in exchange which might in certaincircumstances be achieved.II. The Contribution of Home Agriculture.3. The figures in Table I give estimates of the value of the pre-war and present net output (i.e., deducting from the gross output the value of imports of feeding-stuffs, seeds and store animals) of British agriculture compared with an estimated net output (a) in 1947-48 (the assumed end of the transition period),and (b) at some date after 1950-51. All figures are in terms of pre-war values.Clearly no forecast can be made of post-war values, but if the present generalprice level were maintained all these figures would be increased by something like 65 per cent.4. In making these estimates of net output for 1947-48 and 1950-51 the major emphasis has been placed on the contribution that could be made by increasing the production of those foods, particularly animal products, whichare &quot; expensive &quot; in terms of foreign exchange. To secure an increase in live-stock production we shall require more animal feeding-stuffs. In so far as these can be provided from our own soil we can save the whole of the foreign exchangewhich would otherwise be used to purchase the finished product. A further,but proportionately smaller, saving in foreign exchange can be effected by[29053] &apos; copy No.
importing feeding-stuffs and converting them into animal products in thiscountry .*5. The Ministry of Agriculture estimate that, during the period up to1947^48, it should be possible by appropriate changes in the production andutilisation of human food crops, e.g., wheat and potatoes, and home-grown feedgrain for live-stock, together with some recovery in imports of feeding-stuffs,to raise milk output still further possibly to 15 per cent, above pre-war and tobring about some recovery in the output of meat, bacon and eggs, though not, inthese cases, a complete recovery to the pre-war level.6. Estimates of output after the transition period must clearly be extremelytentative. Forecasts of production up to 1947^8 are largely governed by the changes which can be completed in four years. For estimates beyond that datethere is no such limiting factor, but the estimates included in Table I for&quot; 1950-51 &quot; are based on a reasonable estimate of what could be accomplishedon the assumptions set out in paragraph 8 below. The additional capital invest-ment required would probably not exceed  250 million about 20 per cent. and the increase in the labour force would be of the order of 5 to 10 per cent,over pre-war. Chief reliance is placed on the hope that gains in technical efficiency made during the war will be maintained or even improved upon.7. In more detail, the 1950-51 estimates assume that the output of humanfood crops wheat, sugar beet, potatoes, vegetables and fruit would be higherthan pre-war, in the case of vegetables and fruit very considerably higher. Morehome-grown barley would be used for brewing. More home-grown feeding-stuffs would be used for the production of milk, meat and eggs. It has also been assumed that, with a favourable ratio of imported feeding-stuffs prices to pigand egg prices, imports of feeding-stuffs will have risen to at least their pre-war level. Given these conditions, milk output should be above pre-war by 25 percent,, beef cattle by 12J per cent., sheep by 7 per cent., pigs and poultry by 50per cent. In connection with the proposed&apos; expansion of sheep, it will benecessary to bear in mind the claims of the afforestation programme.8. It must be emphasised that an expansion of home agriculture of the orderindicated above can be achieved only if &apos;(a) sufficient provision can be made for additional capital, for both landlord and tenant;(&amp;) high priority be given to farm building work (including cottages),without which the programme could not be achieved as early as.1950-51;(c) there is no undue shortage of labour, a condition likely to be affectedby relative wage rates in agriculture and competing occupations;(d) a substantial degree of control continues to be exercised over the volumeand type of farming operations, both in the aggregate and on individual farms;(e) farmers are assured a market for their main products at reasonable prices fixed in advance under the new system announced on the5th December, 1944.These limitations and difficulties will be the greater, the higher the level of domestic output that is aimed at.9. The conclusion at this point is that subject to the fulfilment of the aboveconditions the net output of British agriculture and fisheries might be increasedby  60 million at pre-war prices up to 1947-48, and up to &quot; 1950-51 &apos;&apos; by  79million (in both cases compared with pre-war). Assuming a general price levelof 65 per cent, above pre-war, the value of the increased output would be  99million by 1947-48 and  130 million by &quot; 1950-51.&quot; The &quot; 1950-51 &quot; figuresmight be further increased if conditions for obtaining and converting additional* The position may be illustrated numerically thus:  Agriculture &apos;s Contri-- bution to Saving in .Foreign Exchange.Per Cent.(a) If additional livestock products are all.imported     ...       ...       ...

feeding-stuffs (above the pre-war level) were favourable. For the purpose of estimating savings in foreign exchange, it seems best to adopt a round figure of 80 million at pre-war prices t. This  80 million measures the saving whichhome agriculture might contribute regardless of any changes (within reason) inlevels of food consumption. It is, therefore, the answer to the first part of thequestion put before us.III.- Foon Consumption.10. However much and in whatever direction the output of british agriculture may be increased, the absolute saving in exchange will depend on what happens concurrently to food consumption. In view of the increase in purchasing power which may be expected to result from the Governments full employment and social insurance policies, a substantial increase in food con-sumption over pre-war and present levels may be expected unless steps are takento restrict it. Such an increase would be still more probable if the policy of retail price stabilisation Avere to be continued.11. uln this part of the memorandum we have, therefore, tried to estimatewhat expenditure would be necessary after the Avar on imports of food, afteralloAving for an estimated increase in the output of agriculture, on two alterna-tive assumptions as regards food consumption (a) assuming that rationing wereto continue so as to maintain a national diet similar to that of 1944, and(b) assuming the restoration of pre-war levels of food consumption, togetherAvith certain improvements designed to remedy major pre-war deficiencies. Itshould be pointed out that the estimates on assumption (a) are given only by wayof illustration. The continuance of rationing on its present scale for anotherfive or six years could not in practice be contemplated. As a first step, estimates are given in column 4 of Table III of the value of our total food consumption at pre-war prices on these alternative assumptions; the consumption rates per head per week on which these figures are based are shown in Table II.12. It will be seen that the main changes in the improved &apos;&apos; 1950-51 &apos;&apos; dietas compared with pre-war are (a) an increase of over 50 per cent, in liquid milkconsumption, (6) an increase of the same order in the consumption of vegetables,and (c) small increases in the consumption of animal protein foods (meat, bacon,fish and cheese) and of fats, sugar and fruit. It is assumed that to balance these increases there would be a slight fall in consumption of flour.13. The large increases which are provided for in milk and vegetable con-sumption have already been largely attained during the war;J the smallerincreases in animal protein foods, fats, sugar and fruit, merely assume a con-tinuance of pre-Avar trends. Given increased purchasing power and amplesupplies, the consumption figures for these latter foods, as well as for eggs, mightwell be considerably exceeded.14. In Table III the total contribution Avhich home agriculture might maketowards our food supplies by &quot; 1950-51 &quot; is set against our total food require-ments, on the two alternative bases described above, showing the balance whichit would still be necessary to obtain from abroad. In Table Ilia are shoAvnthe net savings in foreign exchange on the two alternative bases. In TablesIII and Ilia the values used are in all cases the estimated f .o.b. values, which,for the purpose of arriving at the possible saving of foreign exchange, are clearly the appropriate figures.IV. Conclusions.15. By &quot; 1950-51 &quot; home agriculture could, given the conditions specifiedin paragraph 8, make a positive contribution of  80 million at pre-war prices,and possibly more if conditions for obtaining and converting additional imported feeding-stuffs were favourable. This would be true even if consumption expandsabove the pre-war level. On the assumption of (a) wages at a substantially higher level in relation to food prices than in pre-war years, (b) full employment, (c) social insurance, including family allowances, (d) the natural increase in population,t Strictly speaking,  77 million at f.o.b. prices.J For the purpose of these calculations, both school milk and the National Milk Scheme areassumed to continue.[29053] B 2
there would be a potential demand for food, which if freely exercised wouldbe likely to absorb, in increased consumption, at least the equivalent of the wholeadditional output from domestic agriculture. In these circumstances, the actualsaving of foreign exchange, after allowing for the expansion of agriculture,would be determined by our policy in relation to food consumption. import control and rationing so severe as to allow no increase in the war-time diet,and involving a continuance of rationing on its present scale for another six years, which we are unable seriously to contemplate, would save something ofthe order of  116 million at pre-war prices, or  191 million at present prices.Without such control of consumption the net saving would be extremely small.16. It follows also, if one accepts the more realistic assumption about post-war consumption rates, that the requirements of foreign exchange for importedfood would be increased as compared with pre-war by anything up to  80 million at pre-war prices, unless home agriculture is expanded over pre-war to an equivalent extent.17.
