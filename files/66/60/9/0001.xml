(44) 759.21s  December, 1944.WAR GABINET.TRANSFER OF WARSHIPS TO CANADA.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.AS the War Cabinet will be aware the Royal Canadian Navy has, in thepast two years, not only increased considerably the number of Canadian warships in service, but has given great assistance to the Royal Navy in manning H.M.Ships. The Canadian Naval Staff are naturally anxious to ensure that canada should be in a position to maintain a post-war Navy more in keeping with Canada&apos;s status than the few escort vessels which comprised the pre-warCanadian Fleet. It is obviously in our interests to encourage this ambition andthe War Cabinet have already agreed (WM. (43) 166th Meeting) to transfer, free of charge, two cruisers and two Fleet destroyers to Canada.Among the H.M. Ships which were manned by Canadian personnel when ourman-power situation first began to be critical were two Lend-lease escort carriers.One of these, H.M.S. Nabob, was so badly damaged in escorting a Russian convoythat she is now unfit for further service. The other, H.M.S. Puncher, is still in commission.In discussions with the Canadian Naval Staff about the Canadian contribu-tion in the Far East and the Canadian post-war Fleet, it was suggested by the canadians that the two escort carriers should be exchanged for two of the newlight Fleet carriers which will shortly be going into commission. It was also suggested that Canada should man a further flotilla of Fleet destroyers.The Admiralty are wholeheartedly in favour of meeting both these suggestions. The Canadian Cabinet have now decided that no more than 13,000Royal Canadian naval officers and men are to serve afloat in the Pacific, and as this fixed number is less than we had hoped the Royal Canadian Navy wouldemploy, there would be no actual man-power advantage in offering these new construction ships. I consider, however, that the post-war advantages of having a Canadian Navy consisting, in addition to the two cruisers already given, oftwo carriers and a flotilla of modern destroyers^ justify a transfer. It will benecessary, at least in the initial stages, for the aircraft and a large proportionof the squadron complements, including aircrews, to be provided by the royal navy. If the offer were accepted, the Canadians would, for man-power reasons,have to give up H.M.S. Puncher.I understand that the Canadian Government have not yet been approached by the Canadian Naval Staff on this matter and that the latter wish to have a firmassurance from us that the ships will be available before putting the proposal totheir Government. The approach will, therefore, have to be in the first instancefrom the Admiralty to the Canadian Naval Mission in this country. It wouldbe made clear that the ships must all remain under Admiralty operational control,and that, although we contemplate they will be employed in the Pacific, it may prove necessary to send them to the Indian Ocean.Until the Canadian Government have been consulted it is not possible to saymuch about the financial side of the transaction. It is quite possible the canadians may wish to pay for the vessels. I therefore propose that ourinitial offer to the Canadian Naval Board should merely state that two light Fleetcarriers and a flotilla of Fleet destroyers can be made available for loan to theRoyal Canadian Navy. If the Naval Board wish to acquire these shipspermanently the terms of. transfer would be a matter for discussion. the canadians are unlikely to be able to man the Light Fleet Carriers until theautumn of 1945, but they could begin to take over destroyers early in theNew Year.Admiralty, S.W.1,21st December, 1944.A.
