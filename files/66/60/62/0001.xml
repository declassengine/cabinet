S DOCUMENT IS THE I ROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E T.W.P. (h5) hb* &apos; COPY HQ.....3:,;22nd January, I9h5*WAR CABINET.YUGOSLAVIA,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.I wish to acquaint my colleagues in the WarCabinet with the latest developments in the Yugoslavsituation and to seek  their views on certain points arising therefrom.It was recently decided by the War Cabinet thatif King Peter declined to accept  the Tito-SubasicAgreement His Majesty&apos;s Government would bye-pass theKingj put that Agreement into force presuming the King&apos;assent, recognise the-United Government which would thenbe set up under it in Yugoslavia and exchangeAmbassadors with such a Governments      A proposal for &apos;action on these lines by the Soviet Government as wellas His Majesty&apos;s Government was put to Marshal Stalinby the Prime Minister and accepted by him.    marshal stalin has. since been-pressing that the plan should becarried into effect without delay.      The position wasalso explained by the Prime Minister to president roosevelt and by the Foreign Office to the StateDepartments      The President has not yet replied to thePrime Minister but the State Department is evidentlyreluctant to support His Majesty&apos;s Government at anyrate until all hope of &quot;a compromise between King Peter,Doctor Subasic and Marshal Tito has to be abandoned.Meanwhile, exchanges have been proceeding betweenthe Yugoslav Government in London and King Peter with aview to ascertaining the precise nature of theobjections which King Peter has to the Tito-SubasicAgreement and to what extent any compromise could bereached on the counter-proposals made by the King,Contrary to our advice he also asked General Velebitto send a message to Marshal Tito proposing that royalas well as legislative power should be exercised by theGovernment and suggesting an early meeting with MarshalTito.      Marshal Tito has sent a tart reply declining todeal directly with the King and suggesting that if thelatter does not accept the Agreement as it standsDoctor Subasic should immediately proceed to Belgradewith his Government and take the necessary measures toput the Agreement into force      Since further delay canonly be dangerous,  the P-^ime Minister indicated in his speech in the House of Commons on 18th January that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would have to go ahead and presumethe King&apos;s consent if this delay was prolonged.    KingPeter has now sent a letter to the Prime Minister&apos;protesting against this statement and maintaining  thathis consent cannot bo presumed.

There are two alternative courses of action open to us:1 .      Without waiting for any assurance from the U.S.Government that they approve our policy to inform King Peterthat unless he and Doct or Sub basic are able to reach some     -agreement &quot;by a given date in the immediate futures H.M,Government will have to take action without any further communication with His Majesty,      H.M. Ambassador in washington v/as in fact instructed on January 20th to informthe State Department that the given date would he January 23rd,and that we should then invite Doctor Subasic and hisGovernment to proceed to Belgrade and there carry out theTito-Subasic Agreement in concert with the National Committeeof Liberation.2,      Tc postpone the action indicated in (1) above&quot;485&apos;and seek to obtain a definite decision from the U,S.  government as to whether or not they approve this policy.In view of the unsatisfactory and non-committalreplies so far received from the State Department to our requests for an expression of their views,  a further telegram was sentto H.M. Ambassador in Washington last night instructing him tosee Mr. Stettinius,  to explain to him the latest developments and to invite his urgent observations.     Lord Halifax v/asauthorised to inform Mr.  Stettinius that we should postpone,if necessary,  taking action on January 23rd as originally proposed,  in order to give an opportunity for the U..S.Government to express their views.I suggest therefore that we should postpone anyfurther action until we learn the U.S.  Government&apos;s views onour proposal.      If they are&apos; in agreement with it, we should then tell King Peter that we shall take action on a given dateif he has come to no agreement with Doctor Subasic by then.If the U.&amp;e  Government&apos;s reply is unsatisfactory or non-committal the position will be reviewed afresh.A.E.Foreign Office,22nd January,  19^5*
