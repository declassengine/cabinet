In arriving at their proposals for intakes into the armed Forces in the first six months of 1945 (W.P.(44) 751),the Committee had accepted estimates made &quot;by the Joint war production Staff and shown in paragraph 8 of the memorandumby the Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P.(44) 718)These were as follows:-Munitions Labour ForceThousandsAdmiraltyMinistry of SupplyEstimatedRequirementMid-1945 ,. 8601,200Ministry of Aircraft Production   1,100TOTAL   .Reduction orIncreaseover end-1944+ 1099  -5233,1606123.      The Supply Ministers now state that these Estimates of requirements at mid-1945 need revision in the followingrespects:-(i) - The First Lord of the Admiralty can now accept a labour force of 850,000 at mid-1945.      Thus theestimated increase of 10,000 in the first halfof the yea*r is not now required.(ii)    The Minister of Supply has now to plan certainproduction (e.g. shells) so as to cover possibleneeds in the third quarter of the year.      Forthis purpose the Ministry of Supply labour force at mid-1945 should be 1,250,000 instead of1,200,000.      Thus the Ministry of Supplyreleases in the first half of the year will bereduced from 99,000 to 49x000.

(iii)    The aircraft programme on which the Minister of aircraft Production is at present workingmeans that only 400,. 000 instead of 523,000 can be  released in the first half of the year;    anduntil a revised aircraft programme has heenapproved by the War Cabinet he cannot promisegreater releases.If these changes were accepted the estimated net release&apos; fromthe munitions industries in the first half of 1945. wouldbe 449,000; against the 612,000 assumed by the Committee whenit drew up its proposals for intakes to the Services.      Sofar as intakes into the Armed Forces are concerned,  theeffect would be to reduce by 5,000 the. 20,000 fit young menwhom it was hoped to obtain for the Armed Forces from the munitions industries and to reduce the total available supply for the Armed Forces from 140,000 to 135,000.      The effect on-civilian industry would be more marked, but it is impossiblefor the Committee to consider this until they  ire able tomake firm estimates of the man-power requirements of the munitions indus-tries.4.      The dominating factor in the situation is the size of  -the cut in the Ministry of Aircraft Production labour force.The Committee therefore recommend that the Secretary ofState for Air and the Minister of Aircraft Production shouldbe invited to submit their proposals with regard to theaircraft programme to the War Cabinet as a matter of urgency.J. A.Treasury Chambers,&apos;&apos;    S.W.I.20TH DECEMBER,  1944.
