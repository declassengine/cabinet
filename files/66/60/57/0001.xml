On the night of the 11th/12th H.M. ships Norfolk and Bellona (cruisers)with Onslow, Orwell and Onslaught (destroyers) intercepted a convoy of seven oreight ships attempting to enter Egersund (S.W.. Norway). A large tanker, oneor two ships and an escorting minesweeper were sunk and three or four other ships were left on fire close inshore. Fire from coastal batteries was ineffectiveand a U-boat was driven off. Fighters from H.M. ships Trumpeter and Premier(escort carriers) which covered the withdrawal destroyed one enemy aircraft anddrove off a number of torpedo-aircraft. Two Wildcats were lost but the pilotswere rescued.Home Waters.3. On the 11th one midget U-boat was sunk by shore defences north of theSouth Beveland Canal and another was probably sunk by an M.L. off Flushing.E-boats were active on the night of the 15th/16th. An attack was made onan outward convoy off the North Foreland and L.S.T. 415 was torpedoed; patrols and the Tongue Sand Fort probably damaged the enemy. Off the Scheldt, E-boats were engaged and driven off by patrols.4. On the 15th H.M.S. Thane (escort carrier) was torpedoed in the approaches to the Clyde but reached port.On the 11th the small U.S. Army tanker Y.48 was sunk south of the isle of Wight : all the crew were rescued.5. During the week ending the 14th the combined British and U.S.discharges through the liberated ports were approximately 72,000 men, 9,200vehicles, 327,000 tons of stores, 121,500 tons of petrol and 57,000 tons ofammunition.Mediterranean.Western Mediterranean.6. On the night of the 10th/11th coastal forces in the Gulf of Genoatorpedoed two armed lighters and probably torpedoed a third. On the same nightthe French destroyer Le Fortune was attacked by two explosive motor-boats and sank one of them.Bombardments by Allied warships have continued. On the 10th Le Fortuneshelled transport and troops. On the following day the French cruiser GeorgesLeygues shelled barges on the slipways at Pietro Ligure. On the 14th the Frenchdestroyer Trombe shelled shore positions and on the 15th the French cruisersMontcalm and Georges Leygues with H.M.S. Lookout (destroyer) bombardedunder air cover the harbours of San Remo and Porto Maurizio. The Montcalmalso shelled a command-post at&quot;Bordighera.On the night of the 17th/18th patrol craft engaged explosive boats south ofMonaco and sank one of them.Four Italian ships, the cruiser A ttilio Regolo, two destroyers and a gunboatwhich were interned in the Balearic.

H.M eteer (destroyer) captured two caiques in the Qulf of Voloon the night of the 11th/12th and a diesel tug two days later.L.S.T. 4 was mined and damaged in the iEgean on the 14th but reachedport: there were 13 casualties including one killed.East Indies.10.   The following reports have been received of recent patrols by H.M.submarines : Tudor sank seven large schooners or junks northbound with explosives orpetrol off the Burma coast. Statesman sank five coastal craft north of Sumatra.Shakespeare sank a 1,000-ton cargo ship in convoy off the Andamans. Whileshelling and inflicting severe damage on another ship, Shakespeare herselfsustained damage by gunfire and was unable to dive. She was repeatedly attacked and further damaged by aircraft, one of which she shot down, but was eventuallytaken in tow and reached port. Trenchant and I&quot;errapin patrolling in company in the Malacca Strait sank a trawler escorting a convoy of coasters and set on fire or drove ashore all four ships of the convoy. They also sank two minelayersand seven junks. Later they shelled Pandang (east coast of Sumatra). Thoroughshelled and set on fire a ,junk in the Malacca Strait.Naval craft on patrol off the coast of Arakan sank three armed vessels.Pacific.China Sea.11. On the 8th aircraft from a force of U.S. carriers, operating with fastbattleships, bombed airfields on Formosa. Later the aircraft from this forceattacked three escorted convoys which were sighted between Saigon and CamranhBay and a fourth which was further to the eastward. Forty-one ships, of127,000 tons, including one former French cruiser and 10 destroyers, are reportedto have been sunk and 28 ships of 70,000 tons to have been damaged. One of the convoys was entirely destroyed. The large dock at Camranh was demolished,and at Saigon shore and oil installations were devastated. Fifteen Japanese aircraft were shot down, while 97 were destroyed and 56 damaged on the ground.U.S. losses were 16 aircraft.On the 14th and 15th U.S. carrier-borne aircraft carried out attacks along the coast of China, including the ports of Canton, Swatow and Hong Kong. Atotal of 82,000 tons of shipping, including one 17,000-ton tanker, is stated tohave been sunk or damaged.   There was little air oDoosition.O JL   J.Philippines. ...12. Three Allied destroyers, on the night of the 7th/8th, sank a Japanesedestroyer which had been sighted by aircraft off Vigan (West Luzon).On the 8th U.S. P.T. boats sank a small cargo ship in Mindoro Strait.On the 10th Allied destroyers attacked a supply ship and 45 barges whichwere unloading at San Fernando (north of Lingayen Gulf) destroying or damagingall the vessels and stores. They also shelled the harbour and destroyed threeammunition dumps.On the following night Japanese light craft attacked warships and transportsin the Lingayen Gulf, and swimmers with explosives caused minor damage to shipping.New Guinea.13. On the 9th one of H.M. Australian destroyers shelled positions nearAbau (E. of Port Moresby).Java Sea.14. H.M. S/M Sirdar sank a 350-ton coaster off West Sourabava during a recent patrol. &quot;Anti-Submarine Operations.15. Fifteen attacks were reported during the week, of which 9 were by shore-based aircraft and 6 by warships. TJ.S. destroyers possibly sank a U-boat500 miles north of the Azores on the 16th. &apos;[29063] , B
Enemy Intelligence.16, The present operational strength of the Japanese fleet is estimated tobe approximately as follows : probably 3 battleships, 2 14&quot; battleship-carriers,1 old training carrier, 2 converted carriers, 2 escort carriers, 6 heavy cruisers,9 light cruisers, about 45 destroyers. These figures refer only to fully effectiveships and do not include those damaged or refitting.U-boats.17. It is believed that the number of U-boats fit for operations is graduallybeing increased.The present concentration in Home Waters is estimated to include threebetween the Isle of Man and Milford Haven and four in the Channel.On the 2nd, a variety of midget known as the Seehund was used off the scheldt. This is reported to be 35-40 feet in length and 3-4 feet in beam witha crew of two. Its speed on the surface is 6 knots and 2 knots submerged.Two torpedoes are carried slung outboard. Its mechanical endurance isthree days; it carries oxygen for a submersion of 30-40 hours and can dive toa maximum depth of 100 feet. Six of these craft are stated to have arrived in Holland on the 1st; another 30 are still in Germany but are ready to operate.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18. Eight ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boat during theweek, of which five are known to have sunk. Two tankers were sunk and a U.S.ship torpedoed in coastal convoy off Halifax. A U.S. troopship was damagedeither by torpedo or mine off Havre and was beached and a Norwegian tankerwas torpedoed off the mouth of the Clyde. A tanker was sunk south-west of the isle of Man. A small U.S. ship and a coaster which went to her assistance were both sunk off Holyhead.One ship was sunk by a mine off the Humber and one was sunk by under-water explosion east of Malta.Allied Minelaying.19. Surface craft have laid mines in the Channel and off the norwegian coast. Aircraft, including naval aircraft, have laid mines in the Baltic and in norwegian waters.Aircraft have also laid mines off the coast of Burma.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.20. No minelaying by enemy aircraft in Home Waters has been reported,but E-boats laid mines off the East Coast on one night of the week and aresuspected of minelaying on two other nights.A new swept channel has been established from the Isle of Wight toCherbourg.During the week 24 mines have been destroyed in the south Corfu channel.South of the Dardanelles entrance. 14 mines have been destroyed during the clearance of a deep minefield.Enemy minefields have been declared in Canea Bay and in the Gulf ofMirabella on the north coast of Crete, off Serpho in the western ^aegean and east of Levitha in the Dodecanese.The mine totals are 6,267 ground and 8,446 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21. It is reported that, probably owing to frequent allied interference, theKiel Canal, Lubeck and other ports on the River Trave are now being used in place of North Sea ports for the shipment of war material to Norway.Last year Danish shipowners agreed that, from the end of November, noDanish ships would in future be sent to German North Sea ports. Coal ships would load at Baltic ports, mainly at Danzig.R.M.S. Aquitania.22. The Aquitarda&apos;s maiden voyage began on the 30th May, 1914; since that day she has steamed 2,610,039 miles, and her original boilers are still in use.   Though built for 23 knots on transatlantic passage, she was able to average
24-99 knots in 1939.   Even now, when war-lading entails greater draught thanin peace-time, she can still average 23 knots.On the 1st August, 1914, she was taken over as an A.M.C. She also carried,as a transport, some 95,000 troops, and some 25,000 as a hospital ship. In this war, between 1939 and May 1942 she made 19 voyages as a troopship, carryingin all 92,003 passengers and steaming 284,033 miles to ports as varied as port moresby in Papua, Massawa in Eritrea, Singapore, Fremantle, Honolulu andHalifax. Since May 1942 she has been used as an Atlantic ferry, making 21round voyages of 144,210 miles and carrying 187,838 passengers.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.23. In the sectors of the First French and Seventh U.S. Armies there havebeen a number of local engagements often involving fierce fighting but no large forces. Both the enemy and the Allies have made minor gains after attack and counter-attack. ^ .The Ardennes salient has been substantially reduced by pressure from theThird U.S. Army on the southern flank, and the First U.S. Army with troops ofthe Second British Army on the northern flank. On the 16th armoured columnsfrom north and south converged upon Houffalize. Further north, U.S. troops have advanced to within 5 miles of St. Vith.An attack by British forces in the sector north of Sittard which was launchedon the 16th has made good initial progress with advances of from 3 to 4 miles.Southern Sector.24. The enemy has made further gains south of Strasbourg, and on several occasions small bodies of French troops were isolated in villages north of Selestat,but were later evacuated without loss. The enemy commands some 15 miles ofthe Strasbourg-Selestat road, but the situation in this area has now been stabilised.East of Haguenau, the enemy holds a small bridgehead across the Rhine,which he has been unable to enlarge in spite of several determined attacks inbattalion strength. On the 9th, in the area N.E. of Haguenau, the enemy madea 3-mile penetration of the Seventh U.S. Army&apos;s defences based on the maginot line. U.S. armoured forces have counter-attacked strongly and have recoveredmost of the ground lost. Throughout the week U.S. troops have been attacking the southern tip of the enemy penetration in the forest country south of Bitsche.Progress has been slow against determined enemy resistance. There have been several local engagements east of Sarreguemines and south of Saarbruckenwithout any substantial change in positions.Central Sector.25. On the 10th strong forces of the Third U.S. Army attacked the enemypocket S.E. of Bastogne which was eliminated after 4 days&apos; fighting, duringwhich time over 3,000 prisoners were taken. North and west of Bastogne onthe 11th, the left flank of the Third U.S. Army made contact with British forcesin St. Hubert, which the enemy had evacuated, and- pushed back the enemyover the River Ourthe, which runs S.E. from Laroche towards Bastogne. here the British forces halted on the line of the Ourthe, and the Third^and FirstU.S. Armies continued to press in upon the enemy salient. On the 15th, Noville,5 miles north of Bastogne, was occupied, and on the following day armouredcolumns from north and south converged in Houffalize.On the First U.S. Army front, between Laroche and Malmedy, the centre of the line about Vielsalm, 10 miles due west of St. &quot;Vith, has remainedcomparatively stationary but on both flanks strong U.S. forces have made considerable progress.On the right, U.S. troops have reached Bovigny and have occupied Cherain.On the left, an attack directed astride the Malmedy-St Vith road has reachedseveral points 5 miles north of St. Vith.   -Northern Sector.26.   On the 16th troops of the Second British Army attacked in the sectornorth of Sittard.   Progress has been slow in the face of extensive minefields,[29063] b 2
bridge demolitions, and foggy weather, but by the 17th some 3 to 4 miles had. been gained.North of Tilburg the enemy has established a small bridgehead across theMaas and has resisted local counter-attacks.   No major forces are involved.Italy.27.   There is nothing of importance to report. &apos;&apos; &apos;Greece.    &quot; *.28. Following negotiations between General Scobie and E.L.A.S. delegates,a truce was signed during the evening of the 11th. In order that E.L.A.S.might have time to issue the necessary orders, the truce did not become operativetill the 15th. E.LA.S. have evacuated their forces from northern Peloponnese,Attica, Bceotia, part of Thessaly, and an area surrounding Salonika : these areasinclude the four principal ports of Greece.Since the truce was signed, Allied troops have continued to range centralGreece and northern Peloponnese. and to search for arms, with minor incidentsonly, whilst the E.L.A.S. forces carried out their withdrawal in orderly fashion.Thirty-six battalions of the Greek National Guard have become operational.The Eastern Europe Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.29.- In N.W. Finland the Germans are withdrawing towards Norway.Between the 12th and 16th, the Finns had followed up the withdrawal for about15 miles.Central, Sector.30. On the 12th the Russians opened their winter offensive from theirbridgehead S.W. of Sandomierz (100 miles south of Warsaw). Two days latera second attack was begun from two bridgehead areas N.E. and east of Radom.The former attack, after two days&apos; fighting, achieved a penetration of up to25 miles on a 40-mile front; the forces in this thrust have now forced two riverlines, taken the railway junction of Kielce and are making rapid progress towards Germany&apos;s eastern frontier. In the latter attack, the two bridgeheadareas had been joined by the 16th, the breach was widened to 80 miles and a40-mile advance took the Russians beyond Radom.On the 17th they reported that these advance troops had crossed the RiverWarta and had occupied the town of Czestochowa, and some 20 miles N.E. and40 miles E.N.E. respectively the towns of Radomsko and Przedborz.Meanwhile, an offensive across the River Narew, begun on the 14th, had advanced up to 20 miles on a 60-mile front and reached Ciechanow (47 miles .W. of Warsaw).   The capture of Warsaw was also announced.In addition to these attacks the Germans have reported two other majorthrusts, which the Russians have not yet mentioned; in East Prussia along theKovno-Konigsberg railway and between the Vistula and the Czechoslovakfrontier.Southern Sector.31. Fierce fighting is reported in southern Slovakia, where the russians are pushing northwards in the direction of Zvolen; the town of Lucenec was captured on the 14th.Inside Budapest, the Germans are reported to have fallen back to the centre of the city from their positions in Pest (on the eastern bank of the Danube).The German counter-attack from the NW. and west towards Budapest had bythe 12th slackened in intensity, when the Germans were still about 15-20 milesdistant.   Since that date there has been no large-scale fighting.Yugoslavia.32. In the south, Partisan forces continue to follow up the German with-drawai, but in the area N.E. of Sarajevo the enemy are counter-attacking.In N.E. Yugoslavia, Partisan counter-attacks with Russian support have successfully checked the enemy&apos;s eastward advance near Virovitica.
Burma;33. In the Arakan, Allied troops invaded the Myebon Peninsula on the 12th,capturing the town of Myebon on the following day, against slight resistance.They are continuing to make progress despite stiffening opposition. Japanesesmall-scale attempts at counter-landings in the Ponnagyun area have all been repulsed. In the Kaladan Valley our troops have made some further progress and are now in contact with the enemy 17 miles ..S..W. of Kyauktaw.In Central Burma the Japanese offere,d stiff resistance in the village ofBudalin, 20 miles north of Monywa; it fell to our troops, however, on the 12th.With the capture of Budalin leading elements of our forces are now only 6 miles north of Monywa, and, further to the east, slight progress has been made by our troops south and S.W. of Shwebo. ,/Namhkam, in Northern Burma, fell to Allied troops on the 17th. Our forces are in contact with the enemy 12 miles south of the village.Philippines.34. On Luzon, TJ.S. troops have advanced some 25 miles southwards fromthe Lingayen Gulf and forward elements have now reached a point 4 miles southof San Clemente on thednngayen-Tarlac Road, and Bayambang on the railwayrunning from San Fernando to Manila. Enemy opposition has been only slightin this area. Striking eastwards, U.S. patrols have reached Urdaneta on theroad from San Fernando to Manila, without contact.In the north-eastern sector, U.S. forces are driving the enemy back into the hills east of San Fabian. According to press reports, fighting in this area isthe heaviest since the original landing. U.S. forces are also pressing on west-wards and leading troops are 20 miles NW. of Lingayen.Up to the 15th, Japanese casualties were 542 killed and 14 prisoners of war!AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.35. Fighter Command flew 47 defensive sorties against flying bombs (seeparagraph 44).Attacks on long-range rocket sites are referred to in paragraph 37.Home Waters.36. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 859 sorties: 16 aircraft are missing.Mosquitoes set on fire two ships and a trawler-type auxiliary in Lervik, anda Halifax scored a hit on a 3,000-ton ship off Kristiansand. Thirty-two Beau-fighters, of which 6 failed to return, successfully attacked shipping in Marsdiep;the hull of an incomplete merchant vessel and 3 M.-class minesweepers were allseverely damaged and set on fire.Bomber Command Lancasters dropped 18 x 12,000-lb. bombs against theU-boat pens at Bergen, but smoke or haze rendered observation difficult; otherLancasters attacked shipping in the port area, sinking one vessel and obtainingnear misses on 3 others. Fortresses visually bombed the Blohm and Voss U-boatyard at Hamburg (200 tons). &quot;&apos;A total of 404 sea-mines were laid.Western Europe.37. In the week ended dawn on the 17th, aircraft of S.HA.E.F. (Air) flew8,887 sorties and dropped 3,620 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawn on the18th, Bomber Command and U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew 7,676 sorties and dropped 19,476 tons, while Fighter Command and U.S. VIII fighter command flew 3,846 sorties. Aircraft carrying supplies to the Continent onlyflew 360 sorties. Two hundred and seventy-four enemy aircraft were destroyed;199 Allied aircraft are missing and 114 are outstanding.The main effort of the heavy bomber forces was directed against communi-cation targets and against oil installations throughout Germany. Threeconcentrated attacks were delivered against the railway centre at Saarbrucken,
580 tons being released on the 13th, 760 tons the following night and 346 tonsnext day. Excellent results are reported in attacks on similar objectives atGravenbroich (366 tons) and Reutlingen (137 tons), whilst those at Paderborn(1,030 tons), Krefeld-TJerdingen (670 tons), Augsburg (600 tons), Dessau (384tons), Dresden (305 tons), Bischofsheim (263 tons), Freiburg (235 tons), Ingolstadt(238 tons) and Kaiserslautern (222 tons) were bombed with unobserved results.Totals of 1,503 and 450 tons were released against 7 bridges across the Rhinebetween Frankfurt and Karlsruhe, and against three in or near Colognerespectively, whilst the railway viaduct at Bielefeld was attacked by Fortresseswith unobserved results.Attacks against fuel installations were widespread, a total of almost9,000 tons being released. Conditions were favourable when Lancastcrs struckat the synthetic oil plant at Merseburg (Leuna) (2,200 tons) and, although results were difficult to assess as smoke obscured the target, a late aircraft reported theglow of fires visible from a distance of 45 miles and 3 columns of black smokerising to 8,000 feet. Although identification of a similar target at Politz (8 miles . of Stettin) was hampered by a smoke screen, the attack (800 tons) was con-centrated; similar results are reported from the bombing of these plants at Zeitz(1,320 tons), Brux (860 tons) and Wanne-Eickel (568 tons). By day, U.S. heaviesreleased 351 tons on 3 refineries at Hamburg, 216 tons on that at Hemmingstad:,134 on that at Ruhland, and 300 tons in the course of two attacks on the Rothenseeplant at Magdeburg; subsequently this latter town received over 1,000 tons in a successful and concentrated, night attack substantial fires still burning being-observed by Mosquitoes attacking some 30 hours later. The Benzol plant nearBochum and that near Recklinghausen were bombed and also the fuel depotsat Dulmen, Derben, Ruthen and Ehmen.Other targets included the chemical works at Bitterfeid (244 tons), while a force of 66 Mosquitoes attacked Berlin.Adverse weather considerably restricted operations by S.H.A.E.F. (Air) overthe battle area; good results were, however, obtained by fighters and fighter-bombers against enemy communications and movements in the course of the two days during which visibility had improved; over 40 locomotives, 500 railwaytrucks, 800 M.T. and 70 A.F.V. were reported to have been destroyed, whilst59 enemy aircraft were shot down. Mosquitoes operated by night in varyingstrength up to 110 aircraft, but on the majority of occasions results wereunobserved. Road and rail bridges and communication centres mainly behind theenemy salient were successfully attacked by medium bombers, which flew over700 sorties during the course of the week against such targets. Bostons attacked the forts at Dunkirk with good results.On two days of the week Spitfires of Fighter Command in attacks on long-range rocket sites in the Hague area obtained many strikes in the target areas.The activities of the G.A.F. were restricted by weather, which afforded theopportunity to restore serviceability after the losses suffered on the 1st Januaryduring the attack of Allied airfields. Some 500 fighters operated in close supporton the 14th while on the same day the enemy reacted strongly to the U.S. heavy bombers returning from Central Germany, some 350 aircraft being encountered;over 200 GA.F. aircraft were reported as destroyed during that day. Some125/200 night fighters were airborne, when weather permitted.[Note. Appendices VII and VIII contain Raid Assessments and bomber command statistics respectively.]Southern Europe.38. . In the week ended dawn on the 16th aircraft of M.A.A.F. flew 5,419sorties, of which 563 were by heavy bombers, and dropped 2,387 tons of bombs.Thirty-eight Allied aircraft are missing.Operations were again severely restricted by adverse weather conditions.The only attacks made by heavies of the Strategic Air Force took place on &apos;the 15th, when 765 tons were dropped on railway targets N.E. and S.E. of vienna, and a small tonnage on the railway centre at Treviso.Good results were obtained when 148 Mitchells attacked bridges on the brenner railway, and from an attack by 44 Baltimores on the railway centre atCastelfranco (16 miles N.W. of Bologna), whilst on three nights forces of some50 Bostons inflicted satisfactory damage to communications, particularly in thePo valley.Light  and fighter-bombers and  fighters  continued  their close  supportoperations whenever weather permitted.
Beaufighters and Mustangs of the Balkan Air Force scored many hits ongun positions at Lussinpiccolo, while Spitfires destroyed a Siebel ferry 21 miles south of Sen j.Leaflet operations over the enemy-occupied islands in the iEgean were continued by aircraft of the Middle East Command, and Baltimores successfully attacked an enemy headquarters on the Island of Rhodes. ,Russia.39. Information is scanty concerning the activities of both the russian air Force and the G.A.F. on the Eastern front, but it would appear that the weather has been such as to hamper operations.Far Bast.Burma, Malaya and Siam.40. During the week ended dawn on the 16th, Allied aircraft flew 3,482sorties, of which 1,947 were by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition trans-port aircraft flew 3,383 sorties (6 days), carrying 6,068 tons and 1,260 men, andevacuating 3,906 men and 1,576 casualties. Ten Allied aircraft are missing and18 enemy aircraft were destroyed.A considerable proportion of the operational effort for the week was directedupon targets in Central Burma; both direct and indirect support was providedfor Allied ground forces converging towards Mandalay. In one attack Liberatorsdropped 221 tons on Mandalay and on troops and supplies at Sagaing; this attack was supported by some 50 fighter-bombers which attacked communications andA.A. guns. Many successful sorties were flown by Allied tactical aircraftagainst enemy supplies, communications and transport in this area,; severalbridges were destroyed or rendered unserviceable and many rivercraft, bashas and buildings destroyed. Somewhat farther north towards Shwebo and to the north-east in the districts around Lashio, similar offensive operations were carried out.Several of the heaviest of these attacks were made in the areas of Hsenwi (north of Lashio), still further north at Namhkam, and Monywa and Kyaukka to thewest and south of Mandalay. A number of small-scale but effective attacks weremade on enemy airfields.A further high proportion of the&apos; Allied operational effort was used insupport of our ground forces in the Arakan. Between 500 and 600 offensive sorties were flown, mostly against targets in the Myebon and Teinnyo areas.In Lower Burma, good attacks were made on railway targets in the vicinity of Toungoo. Off Moulmein and Mergui seamines were laid and, at the latter,shipping and jetties were bombed.Enemy activity was on a small scale; a few somewh at ineffective attacks weremade in the Akyab, Myebon and Mandalay areas.The Burma/Siam railway was bombed by Liberators which dropped nearly200 tons. A number of bridges were either destroyed or damaged and tracks,particularly on the approaches to bridges, hit.Super-Fortresses bombed the floating dry dock at Singapore, dropping43 tons, and Georgetown, Penang, where 16 tons were dropped.China Zone.41. In the Salween area, Allied medium and fighter-bombers created roadblocks on the Burma road and attacked troop concentrations and communications in the Wanting area. Similar aircraft attacked locomotive repair shops atSinsiang (Honon) and bridges and rolling-stock at Hanoi.Japan.42. Super-Fortresses attacked two aircraft factories at Mushashino(45 tons) and Nagoya (95 tons). A further 47 similar bombers attacked other targets, including the urban area of Tokyo, where 40 tons were dropped. TenIJ.S. aircraft are missing from these operations and about 20 enemy fighters were shot down.In Formosa, 55 Super-Fortresses dropped 368 tons on Kagi airfield, 7 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground and considerable damage done to airfieldinstallations. Other attacks were made on airfields in Formosa by Liberators and naval aircraft and 37 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. A further24 Super-Fortresses bombed other targets in Formosa and in China.
Pacific.43. In the Philippines, the main Allied effort was concentrated on enemy communications and transport near Lingayen and north and south of Manila.Direct support was also given to U.S. ground forces advancing towards Manila.In this area 12 bridges were destroyed and some 500 trucks and 300 railway wagons were destroyed or damaged. The principal airfields were all attacked,the main effort being directed against the airfields on Luzon. Small shipping was attacked north-west of Luzon and a number of coasters and barges were sunk or damaged.In Borneo, offensive sweeps were flown over the Balikpapan area and a small-scale attack was made on the oil refinery at Miri (Sarawak).In the Celebes, some 150 sorties were made against stores areas and a heavy attack was made on Kendari airfield. Gun emplacements on Lombok and shipping off the S.E. coast of Bali were attacked by Liberators.In the north of Halmahera, over 100 sorties were flown by fighter-bombersagainst supply areas and airfields.. In New Guinea, occupied villages and enemy positions at Wewak were attacked by Beauforts. In New Ireland, New Britainand Bougainville, a variety of targets were attacked, including landing strips, thefloat plane base in Simpsons Harbour, and enemy concentrations.Iwojima airfield, in the Kazan group, was bombed by 26 Liberators.

APPENDIX VII.Air Attacks on Germany.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Cologne.-Photographs taken on the 13th January after the U.S.A.A.F.attacks on the 6th, 7th and 10th January, show that the Hohenzollern road and rail bridge has received a direct hit on the centre span, which has cut one of the six large steel arches from which the weight of the span is suspended. At least two of the lateral bracing members have been cut and there is probable damage to the floor of the bridge at this point. Another direct hit has destroyed a largesection of paving on the south side of the east span. The elevated easternapproach to the bridge has been severely damaged and some ten hits have damaged the tracks and the Cologne/Deutz passenger station.It can be seen that the automobile highway section of the bridge is in service,but that only a single railroad track is in use between the Cologne/Deutz station and the Cologne main station.A span of the South Cologne railway bridge has been destroyed by the attack of the 6th January.The attack on the 10th January caused some damage in the Gereonmarshalling yard, where the large transhipment shed has been severely damaged and tracks in the sidings have been cut in many places.Dortmund Ems Canal Embankment (Ladbergen). Further cover obtained on the &apos;14th January shows additional damage to that previously reported as aresult of the Bomber Command attack on the 1st January, this damage is theresult of delayed action bombs which were still bursting at the time of the firstcover. A new breach of 230 feet is seen in the west bank of the West Canal, andtwo smaller breaches to the east bank of the West Canal. There is probablydamage to the Glane aqueduct, and a large crater almost entirely cuts the easternembankment of the East Canal.Ehrang Marshalling Yard.- Snow renders interpretation of photographs taken on the 13th January difficult, but it can be seen that the U.S.A.A.E. attackon the 2nd January caused heavy damage across the width of &quot;the yard andparticularly in the sorting sidings. A large number of wagons have been destroyed or damaged, and severe new damage has been inflicted on buildingsnear the damaged locomotive shed at the south end of the yard. It can also beseen that the bridge which conveys the track system over the River Mosel, andwhich was previously reported as damaged as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attackon the 23rd December, is now completely down along nearly half its length, andthis has caused the blocking of the river.Euskirchen Marshalling Yard. Photographs taken on the 8th Januaryshow that damage caused by the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 24th. 27th, 30th and31st December, and the 7th January, is heavy in ail parts of the marshalling yard,but particularly at the eastern end. The station, engine sheds and turn-tablehave all been damaged and three rail over road bridges at the eastern ena of the yard have been hit. There are a large number of craters in the sidings, wherea considerable number of wagons have been destroyed. All through traffic was still impossible at the date of photography.South of the yard heavy industrial damage has been caused and this includes the destruction of two gas holders. In the south and east of the town business and residential property has suffered severely.Hemming stadt. Photographs taken on the 15th January after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 14th January show that several important elements inthe oil refinery have been affected. The new damage includes hits on the oil sandconstruction plant, the heavy damage of one of the two crude stills and thedestruction of the oil despatch sidings.It is considered unlikely that there will be any production for a month.Kaiserslautern--Photographs taken on the 15th January show that as aresult of the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 5th and 13th January more than 50 freshcraters have been made in the marshalling yard. In addition the through line shave been cut in 13 places and considerable damage has been inflicted onrolling-stock.
Ludwigshafen. Photographs taken on the 13th January after the attack by Bomber Command on the 2nd/3rd January on the I.G. Farben Works, arepartly obscured by cloud, and the site of- the octane plant is completely cloudcovered, though craters can be seen in the vicinity. Considerable fresh damagecan be seen in the remainder of the works and-the area most seriously affectedis the intermediates and dye-stuffs plant, where at least 12 buildings have sufferedvarying degrees of damage. Scattered incidents of damage extend throughoutthe works, and the nitrogen and methanol plant at the northern end has sufferedfairly severely. In the portion of this plant visible at least eight buildings havebeen damaged.Further photographs taken on the 14th January show considerable damage in the previously cloud-covered part of the works. The octane plant in the oil refinery has been blanketed with craters, a pump house and a distillation columndestroyed, a group of storage cylinders has received a direct hit and anunidentified building has been almost entirely destroyed. 12 buildings in thearea occupied by dye-stuffs manufacture (including a large power house) have been destroyed or damaged. Other sections of the plant damaged are the heavychemical plant (severely affected), the nitrogen and methanol plant, and the lubeoil plant. Several unidentified buildings, sheds and workshops have also been hitin the central part of the works.Mittelland Canal &quot;Embankment. Photographs taken 12 days after the bomber Command attack on the lst/2nd January show a heavy concentration ofcraters covering the canal for a distance of half a mile. Several stretches of bothbanks have been so severely broken down that their course is almostindistinguishable, the bed of the canal being drained over this section. The waterlevel at either end is very low, and at least 10 barges are stranded or wrecked andmany others aground.Neuss Marshalling Yard. Photographs taken on the 13th January showthat as a result of the Bomber Command attack on the 6th/7th January freshdamage has been caused to rail facilities, principally in the southern two-thirds of the yard. The transhipment shed has suffered fresh heavy damage and several small buildings, as well as the western locomotive depot, have been partiallygutted. Several derailed wagons could be seen in the marshalling yard nearly aweek after the attack. West of the marshalling yard heavy fresh damage has been caused to several large buildings of the bolt factory of Bauer and Schaurte.Rastatt. Photographs taken on the 14th January after the U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 7th January show that damage has been caused in the marshalling yard, where a small building north of the goods depot has been hit and craters,which have since been filled, made in the station sidings. The passenger station at the south end of the yard has also been hit.In the town, the large-machine and final assembly shops of Waggon-FabrikRastatt, some buildings of the Accumulatoren Fabrik Berga and the coppersmelting works of A. Fahlbusch have all received damage and there are manyincidents of business, commercial and residential damage west of the marshalling yard.^Vohwinkel Marshalling Yard. Photographs taken on the 14th Januaryshow that as a result of the Bomber Command attack on the lst/2nd Januaryconsiderable damage was caused to tracks and rolling-stock in the sidings. Thewagon repair shop near the sorting sidings has been entirely destroyed and rolling-stock nearby severely damaged. Through running lines are seen to beobstructed by craters.Ztveibriicken. Interpretation of photographs taken on the 14th Januaryafter the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 3rd and 7th January is hindered by snow,but damage can be seen in the marshalling yard and in the town. In the first-named, the station has been partially destroyed and other railway facilitiesaffected, while tracks have been cut and several wagons destroyed, damaged orderailed. Immediately north of the marshalling yard a number of factorybuildings have been damaged.There is considerable damage and destruction to business and residential property and to public buildings in the centre as well as in the north of the town.
