Inthe present stage of the war it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that men can be released.Departments should bear this in mind when scrutinising applications, andshould, until further notice, decline to sponsor proposals for release unless theyare imperatively necessary in the interests of the war effort. The only exceptionthat can be made is for a limited number of specialists for housing.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,30th December, 1944.[-28921]
