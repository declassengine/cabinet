THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECEET.W.P. (45) 3.1st January, 1945.WAR CABINET.ITALIAN CLAIMS AGAINST GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN September last the Italian Government asked whether they would be permitted to participate in the Armistice with Germany. We consulted theUnited States Government as to the reply and said that we for our part werenot prepared to concern ourselves in any way with any claims which Italy might make against Germany.2. Shortly afterwards the joint Anglo-American declaration about italy was issued which forecast an improvement in the status of the Italian Govern-ment and a more helpful attitude by the Allies towards Italy. This, in the viewof the United States Government, made it difficult to adopt an entirely negative attitude to the question of Italian claims against Germany. The United StatesGovernment have therefore now suggested that the Italian Government shouldbe invited to submit informally their views on the surrender arrangements for germany to the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom andthe U.S.S.R. Subsequently, the United States Government would submit theItalian claims to the European Advisory Commission for scrutiny. It would,however, be made clear that we undertook no obligation towards the Italians by accepting their claims for examination. The United States Government considerthat some such action as this is necessary in view of the policy we are at presentpursuing towards Italy and have been influenced by the feeling that some ofthe Italian claims could no doubt be met without prejudice to the interests ofany of the United Nations.3. The treatment the Americans propose to give Italy is a good deal less favourable than that being accorded to our European Allies. The European AlliedGovernments have been asked to submit to the European Advisory Commissiontheir views on the terms to be imposed on Germany, and will be informed ofthe main lines of the Instrument of Surrender prepared by the Commission,and given an opportunity for an oral discussion with the Commission. So faras the Italians are concerned it is merely proposed that their views should beinvited and that we should consider ourselves under no obligation whatever tosee that the Italians receive satisfaction. This treatment is, however, morefavourable than that which we are granting to non-European United NationsGovernments, such as Brazil or China. These countries are not being invitedto lay their views on the surrender arrangements for Germany before the european advisory Commission. The fact that Italy is a European State, has been ravagedby Germany, and has lost many hundreds of thousands of prisoners to germany would, however, justify the course the Americans now propose to adopt.4. My own view is that no harm would be done by accepting the american proposals. I therefore advise that we should do so, subject to stipulating thatwe should inform the Soviet Government and the French Provisional Governmentof this exchange with the Italian Government and that we should stipulate that the French Provisional Government should be among those to whom theItalian Government should communicate their views concerning the surrenderarrangements for Germany.A.
