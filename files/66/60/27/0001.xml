THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. Copy NoW.P. (45) 10.Mh January, 1945.WAR CABINET.MORALE AND WELFARE IN THE FAR EAST.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.MY colleagues will recall that in my directive of the 20th November,W.P. (44) 670, 1 asked that reports should be rendered by certain Ministers on matters affecting morale and welfare of our Forces in the Far East. Since thatdate Lord Munster&apos;s letter to the Secretary of State for India has been received and circulated to the War Cabinet, W.P. (44) 722 of the 11th December, and his report has been published as a White Paper, Cmd. 6578. Finally I made astatement in the House of Commons on the 20th December.2. I think that my colleagues will wish to see the attached reports which Ihave received in response to the requests in W.P. (44) 670. A report is still outstanding regarding mails for the Forces overseas, but I understand that the overseas Mails Committee will be submitting a further report in the near future in accordance with paragraph 5 of W.P. (44) 656.3. In order that this matter may be kept under a continuous review, I amproposing to initiate a system under which the various Departments concerned,and in particular the War Office and the India Office, submit monthly progressveports showing the action taken regarding the matters dealt with in my directiveof the 20th November, and the recommendations made by Lord Munster in his letter and report. The first such return should be rendered on the 1st February,1945. These reports, which should be forwarded to the Secretary of the WarCabinet, should indicate in particular any cases in which progress in regard toagreed policy is being held up, and the reasons therefor.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,9th January, 1945.[28962a]

Memorandum from the Minister of Reconstruction of the 7th December.(Paragraph 1 only.)3. Memorandum from the President of the Board of Trade of the 11thDecember.4.   Memorandum from the Minister of Information of the 19th December.5.   Memorandum from the Minister of Production of the 28th December.Enclosure 1.HOUSING.Priorities in Letting of Houses.Memorandum from the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland.In paragraph 8 of his Directive on Morale and Welfare,, dated the20th November (W.P. (44) 670), the Prime Minister directed that-&quot;Consideration to the fact that an applicant for a house is a Serviceman, an ex-Service man Or his wife, should be given in assessing prioritiesfbr allotment. These people must be assured of the possibility of setting up their own homes, and among these, preference should be given to the wives and families of men retained in the Far Eastern theatre after the defeat ofGermany. A report should be made by the Minister of Health .... onthe present system, and on the modifications which would be required in it tomeet this need.&quot;2. The letting of houses managed by Local Authorities, whether permanentor temporary, is by statute in the hands of the Local Authorities.3. They are required by statute to give a reasonable preference to personswho are &quot; occupying insanitary or overcrowded houses, have large families or are living under unsatisfactory housing conditions.&quot;4. In weighing the relative claims of those within these priority groups theAuthority will take into account the conditions under which the families are living at the time when houses become available for letting. We intend to advisethem that the families of ex-Service men and of men still serving who are withouta separate home of their own are outstanding cases of families living underunsatisfactory housing conditions, and that special consideration should be givento ilies of those retained for service in distant theatres after the defeat ofGermany.5. We know that many local Authorities already give such a preference inthe letting of such few houses as become vacant. We intend to discuss with the associations of LoCal Authorities the best means of ensuring that this.policy is adopted throughout the country. Our present view is that this matter can most appropriately be dealt with by administrative action. The steps taken could bemade known to those serving in the Armed Forces and the Merchant Navy.6. We have understood the Directive not to suggest a preference fOr the family of the serving man over the family which includes an ex-service man(possibly disabled) but as indicating that the family of a man still serving shouldbe given the &apos;&apos; Service &apos;&apos; priority.7.   This problem is not dissimilar to that which arose on the Selection ofpersons for vocational training and industrial rehabilitation courses under the[28962] B
Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944. Section 16 of the Act, which secured the general assent of the House, provides that &quot; The Minister shall so exercise his discretion in selecting persons for vocational training and industrial rehabilitation courses ... as to securethat, so far as consistent with the efficient exercise of his powers, preferenceshall be given to men who have served whole time in the armed forces of theCrown or in the merchant navy or the mercantile marine.&quot;H. U. W.T. J.5th December, 1944.[&quot; This memorandum was considered by the Housing Committee at their second Meeting on the 5th December, when they reached the following conclusions : (1) Approved the action proposed by the Health Ministers with a viewto giving priority to Service or ex-Service applicants in theallocation of houses.(2) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade would discuss with the Secretary of State for Scotland the question of the supplyof furniture to tenants of local authority houses.&quot;]Enclosure 2.INFORMATION REGARDING SOCIAL POLICY.Memorandum from the Minister of Reconstruction.I have been considering what I can do to further your wish (W.P. (44) 670)that Service men overseas should be enabled to keep abreast of the more importantdevelopments in social policy at home. As you know, we have already issued some&quot; popular &quot; explanations of particular reconstruction schemes; and I think itwould now be useful to bring some of this material together in a single pamphletwritten in simpler language than that of the White Papers. I have put in hand the preparation of such a pamphlet.W UUL1 U1N .Office of the Minister of Reconstruction,7th December, 1944.Enclosure 3.HOUSES AND FURNITURE FOR EX-SERVICE MEN.Memorandum from the President of the Board of Trade.The only new furniture now being made is utility furniture. I have arranged that this shall be reserved for persons in the following priority classes : (1) Those married since the beginning of the war and setting up house forthe first time.(2) Those setting up house for the first time because they have young childrenor because they are expecting the birth of a child.(3) Those who want beds because their children have outgrown their cots.(4) Those who have lost their furniture by enemy action.(5) Engaged couples intending to marry in the near future.Service men, ex-Service men or their wives are, therefore, already entitledto utility furniture provided they are setting up house for the first time and weremarried since the outbreak of war. Any oases, which come to my notice, ofService men who are setting up home for the first time but were married beforethe war are treated in exactly the same way as those in class (1) above.
The production of -utility furniture has steadily increased this year. It isnow sufficient to meet current demand from the priority classes, and I plan to double the present output by April next. That rate of output should be enoughto meet the present demand plus the new demand arising from the housing programme. But the fulfilment of this programme depends on my receiving the materials which I have been promised, together with the necessary labourand manufacturing capacity.H. D.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,11th December, 1944.Enclosure 4.PUBLICITY AT HOME.Memorandum from the Minister of Information.The - Ministry of Information consider that some correction is needed ofthe idea that the Far Eastern aspect of the war effort has been ignored by theauthorities responsible for publicity. There has, in fact, been a great deal of activity in this field throughout the past year. It is only a disservice to the troopsin the India and South East Asia Commands to give them the idea that theirachievements have been neglected, if that is not the case. In no sense has publicity in Britain about them been confined to &quot; occasional stereotyped tributes.&quot; A fewfigures under different headings will give an idea of the range of activity.1.   Broadcasting.Quite apart from current reference in the news bulletins, the record of talks on the B.B.C. on Far-Eastern war subjects is 30 for the first quarter of 1944,33 for the second quarter, 35 for the third and 26 from ithe 18th october to 30th November. Many of these, of course, were given by officers and menhome from the Burmese theatre.2.   Feature Articles.There has been a constant service of feature articles to the national and provincial papers. 35 articles are noted as placed in September 1944, 50 inOctober and 68 in November, in addition to numerous &quot; home-town &quot; stories placedin the regional press and raw material supplied to magazines for their own uses.3.   Lectures and Meetings.Brigadier Irwin and Brigadier James have had extremely successful lecturetours arranged by the Ministry of Information up and down the country. Therehave also been numerous lectures to special audiences, such as Clubs, Civil DefenceTraining Establishments, &amp;c, from Major Russell, Captain McKelvie, SquadronLeader Gardner and Major-General Roberts.The figures for meetings arranged by the Ministry of Information to hearspeakers on Far Eastern subjects are 876 for the first quarter, 957 for the second,896 for the third and 1,071 from the 18th October to November 30th.4.   Press Conferences.The opportunity of holding Press Conferences has been taken whenever possible. In the last few months conferences have been held by AdmiralMountbatten, Air Marshal Joubert, Major-General Lentaigne, Brigadier Irwin,Air Marshal Baldwin and Major Frank Owen. These figures give some, butnot all, of the activities of the past year.5. Forthcoming Activities now in course of completion, including the following:(a) Films.A big film covering the whole of the Burma Campaign is being made inAmerica by Colonel Bryce and should be due for release about April 1945.   TheFilms Division of the Ministry of Information are working a twelve months&apos;[28962] &apos; b2
schedule of 20 films, both for theatrical and non-theatrical distribution. all available film-material has been released, as and when received, for showing bythe news-reels, which, of course, secure wider and more rapid coverage than anyother film-medium.(b) Official Publications.&quot; S.E-.A.C. Souvenir &quot; (a reprint of the anniversary number of the S.E.A.C.newspaper) should be out in this country in January, 194-5;&quot; Ocean Front,&quot; a booklet dealing with the Pacific War, in February, 1945;and&quot; Burma Front,&quot; the text of which is being written by Major Owen, inthe summer of 1945.(c) Exhibitions.The large travelling exhibition &apos;&apos; War Against Japan &apos;&apos; will be released early next year for showing in London and five major provincial towns and four similarreplicas for some 50 other towns.Ministry of Information19th December, 1944.Enclosure 5.CINEMAS AND WIRELESS.Memorandum from the Minister of Production.In W.P. (44) 670, paragraph 7, I was asked to make a report on the present programme for the provision of cinema and wireless equipment for the forcesin the Far East from this country and the.United States of America, togetherwith a statement of any measures necessary to ensure the early fulfilment of requirements.Cinema Projectors.2. In W.P. (44) 722 (paragraph 51), Lord Munster indicates that therequirements of India alone amount to 1,765 projectors, three-quarters of whichare the 16 mm. type, the remainder being 35 mm. The present total service requirements for amenity and training purposes in all theatres for deliverybetween October 1944 and December 1945 are 5,800 projectors, three-quartersbeing of the 16 mm. type. This is in addition to the 5,000 projectors which have so far been delivered to the Services. These requirements are under urgentreview by the War Office iand the figures quoted above may be increased; butthey are already large in relation to Lord Munster&apos;s figures. The problem of meeting S.E.A.C. requirements for amenities can thus be improved by combingout the equipment at present being used for training purposes and increasingallocations for S.E.A.C. amenities at the expense of other theatres as well as by increasing production.3. Production of both types has increased in the United Kingdom duringthe present year and further increases are planned, rising to double the presentoutput of 16 mm. type. This may require certain labour and capacity priorities(which will be urgently considered as soon as it is clear what is wanted), aswell as a few releases of skilled people from the Services. Given these, it isestimated by the Ministry of Supply that they should meet the present demands for the 16 mm. type with something in hand by the end of 1945. About 80 percent, of the smaller requirement of 35 mm. projectors is likely to be covered;the limit here is capacity. There is a small programme of some 670 projectors inall of both types from America. If the new requirements make it necessary, weshall make efforts to increase this quantity though, on past experience, it seems unlikely that we shall be very successful against the Americans&apos; own requirements.4. It will be necessary to increase the present printing of 16 mm. film bysome 60 per cent.  This will require the release of a further 30 skilled processing
operatives from the Services and additional capacity. In addition arrangements are being discussed with the Americans for an increased supply of printed film.Wireless Receivers.5. Receivers for welfare purposes and for education are very similar.Total Service requirements were recently increased to about 40,000 for 1945(the 1944 requirement should nearly be satisfied). This could be covered fromproduction arranged. But it is now possible that the 1945 requirements will bedoubled and, subject to certain reasonable conditions about type and diversionfrom other sources, it seems possible these requirements (if formulated quickly)can be met from production in the United Kingdom, Canada and France, thoughat the expense of civilian sale in the United Kingdom.O. L.Ministry of Production, S.W.1.28th December, 1944.
