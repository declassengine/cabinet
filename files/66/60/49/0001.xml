THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.The circulation of this paper has hem strictly limitedfor the persswal use of top SECRET copy n0.W.P. (45) 32.15th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE  AIRCRAFT   PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of aircraft Production.THE Programme which at present governs the production of aircraft isthat described in W. P. (44) 572 as the &quot;modified September&quot; programme. Itwas approved by the War Cabinet on the 17th October, 1944 (W.M. (44) 138thConclusions, Minute 2), and subsequently put into effect as the &quot; October &quot;programme.2. The September programme had been based on the assumption that theGerman war would end by the 31st December, 1944, and in consequence involvedsubstantial reductions in aircraft output during the first six months of 1945.In the October programme these reductions are deferred for some months andthis programme in effect caters for a continuance of the German war until the30th June, 1945. It does, however, show a sharp fall in output in July 1945and subsequent months.3. Since the preparation of the September programme and of its offspringthe October programme, a reduction has been brought about in the R.A.F. targetforce for Stage 2, and the extent of American assistance in the first year of stage 2 has been determined. These and other developments have resulted ina new draft programme, the broad outline of which is given in the appendix to this paper. Subject to the settlement of a few details outstanding between our two Departments this programme could be issued this month as the january 1945 programme.4. The January programme differs from the October programme in tworespects, namely (i) it reduces the rate of production after June 1945 to take account of the developments mentioned in paragraph 3, and (ii) it gives a moreup to date forecast of production during the first half of 1945.5. The labour force estimated to be required for the October programme wasgiven in W.P. (44) 572 as follows : 31st December, 1944      ...      ...30th June, 1945  .........31st December, 1945      ......(In actual fact the labour force at 31st December,have been some 40,000 less than this target).   Thegramme cannot be finally estimated until the details remaining to be settled&quot; arecleared but they will be of the following order : 31st December, 1944..........      1,560,00030th June, 1945  ...      .........      1,140,00031st December, 1945.......      ... 920,0001,600,0001,200,0001,170,0001944, will probably prove tofigures for the January pro-[29040]
6. Both the October and January programmes are based on the assumptionthat the German war does not continue after June 1945. If this assumption stillstands, the January programme should be put into effect forthwith, and thediscussions on man-power in 1945, postponed from the War Cabinet meeting onthe 21st December, 1944 (W.M. (44) 173rd Conclusions), until a new aircraft programme had been settled, can be resumed.7. If, On the other hand, there is to be a change in this assumption it willbe necessary to undertake a reassessment of the position. This would be directed towards ascertaining the extent, if any, to which it is now possible to reviveproduction capacity already abandoned or in process of curtailment. The effecton R.A.F. training arrangements would be substantial and serious and a revisionof the man-power allocations to the R.A.F. would be required. The reductionscontemplated in the Ministry of Aircraft Production labour force would need to be reconsidered and possibly postponed. The extent, to which plans andallocations under either programme would have to be disturbed would depend upon the new date chosen; it would be greater the further it was postponed afterthe 30th June, 1945.8. If the postponement were to a date not later than December 1945, it isprobable that the Ministry of Aircraft Production labour force would remain as for the October programme. If later than December 1945 the amount of planning work involved within our two Departments and in the aircraft industry would become formidable and it would be many weeks before a balancedprogramme could be prepared.9. . The War Cabinet are invited to consider the following questions : (i) For the purpose of the aircraft production programme does the30th June, 1945, still hold good as the date by which it may be assumed that Germany will be defeated ?(ii,) If so, is the new January programme approved ?(iii) If not, what other date must be assumed and would the assumptionthat Stage 2 will last eighteen months remain unaltered ?A.
