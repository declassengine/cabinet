H.M.S. A fax (cruiser) shelled enemy positions at Piraeus on the 21st.The discharge of cargo at the port has continued at an average daily rate of800 tons.On the 23rd H.M. ships sank 2 E.L.A.S. caiques near Patras.,H.M.S. Galedon (A/A cruiser) returned from Salonika to Kavalla, where shereported on the 27th that all was quiet.   At Mitylene the situation is easierfollowing the arrival of H.M.S. Sirius (cruiser).While investigating Livadia Bay, Piscopi, on the 23rd, H.M. destroyerE-xmoor was fired on by shore batteries.East Indies.8. On the 20th 60 aircraft from H.M. ships Illustrious said Indomitable(fleet carriers) attacked warehouses, railway yards and oil installations atBelawan Deli on the N.E. coast of Sumatra.   Thick cloud made observation of
results difficult, but 2 oil cisterns were set on fire. Later fighters attacked air-fields in the Sabang area and small craft off the N.W. coast of Sumatra. our forces sustained no casualties; 1 enemy aircraft was destroyed.During recent patrols in the Strait of Malacca H.M.

Reconnaissance of Gdynia on the 21st showed that the nurnberg had sailed.U-boats.13. There has been increased activity in the English Channel, where thereare probably 4 U-boats on patrol. Others are operating in Canadian waters, butelsewhere the situation remains quiet.As far as is known no new types of U-boats are yet in operation.Fifty-one of the new large boats and 29 of the small type are now estimated to be completed.39 U-boats were seen at Gdynia on the 21st.14. Between the 22nd and 24th the 261st Biber Flotilla of midget U-boatsoperated in 2 groups off the Scheldt estuary from bases in the Hook-Maassluisarea. One group carried both mines and torpedoes. Craft of a second flotilla,reported to be in the Maassluis area, may have been operating on the night ofthe 25th/26th. A Biber flotilla normally comprises 30 boats. At least 7 flotillasare probably operational.The Biber has an overall length of 29^ feet, can dive operationally to about60 feet, can make 6^ knots surfaced and 6 knots submerged, carries two21&quot;. torpedoes, and has an endurance of 60-70 miles surfaced and about 5 milessubmerged.   Human endurance is estimated at about 48 hours.An increased number of midget U-boats was seen at Wilhelmshaven onthe 24th.15. Photographic reconnaissance of Bremen shows that work on theunfinished graving dock, which is being converted into a shelter for the fittingout of the new type of U-boats building at an adjoining yard, is going forwardrapidly.Enemy Attack on Shipping.16. The Belgian s.s. Leopoldville (11,509 tons) with about 2,500 U.S. troops on board was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat off Cherbourg; about 1,500 wererescued. A British coaster in convoy was sunk in the same area. Midget U-boatssank a ship off Flushing.[zoyuoj ;   b
One ship in a homebound convoy was torpedoed off Halifax, and a U.S. shipfrom Fremantle was torpedoed off Sydney probably by a long-range german-boat operating from Malaya. .&apos; &apos; .   &apos;A ship in convoy from Antwerp was mined and sunk off Ostend, and a ship in a homebound convoy from Gibraltar was sunk by mine or torpedo off the isle of Wight. VAllied Minelaying.17. Mines have been laid by surface craft in Home Waters and by aircraft in the Kattegat, East Baltic and Oslofiord.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.18. On 2 nights of the week E-boats laid mines in the Ostend area. Onthe evening of the 25th over 20 enemy aircraft were suspected of minelaying inthe Scheldt, and some 10 aircraft operated between Flushing and Calais on thefollowing evening.16 mines have been destroyed during the week on the convoy route and inthe Scheldt approaches.19.   From the 12th to tihe 21st, 32 drifting mines were sunk by U.S.destroyers and coastal craft off the south coast of France.The mine totals are 6,217 ground and 7,708 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.20. From the 16th to 30th November, enemy shipping losses amounted to11 ships of 37,393 tons; in addition 20 ships of 63,697 tons were damaged. Thetotal of enemy losses during the whole month amounted to 19 ships of 58,815 tons;26 ships,of 69,820 tons were damaged.21. It is estimated that since the 18th October, when the main movementof troops from Norway to Denmark began, the equivalent of about four and a halfdivisions have been shipped across the Skagerrak.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.22. The enemy counter-offensive which started on the 16th has, duringthe past week, made limited progress. Rapid regrouping by the Allied Forceshas succeeded in forming two firm flanks; there has been little to report on theremainder of the front.Southern Sector.23. During the past week activity within the First French Army&apos;s area has been limited to local gains north and NW. of Colmar.North of Strasbourg the Seventh U.S. Army has consolidated its positionsalong the German frontier. Resistance has stiffened throughout this sector and several enemy counter-attacks have been repulsed; there have been no positionalchanges during the week. Further west the Third U.S. Army has withdrawnits bridgeheads across the River Saar at Saarlautern and Dillingen.Central Sector.24. On the southern flank of, the enemy breakthrough, the position becamestabilised in the Echternach area by the 20th, but enemy pressure continued N.W.of Bastogne and penetrations north and south of the town succeeded in cutting off the garrison on the 21st. The garrison resisted all enemy efforts to capturethis important road centre and U.S. forces, pressing from the south, gainedcontact on the 26th after four days of hard fighting.On the northern flank of the penetration, the enemy has been -attackingfiercely between Malmedy and Marche. To conform with the general line ofdefence, on the 24th, the salient between St. Vith and Vielsalm was withdrawnafter a gallant stand by two U.S. Divisions who did a great deal to hold up
enemy reinforcements. Enemy armour from the Marche area thrust north-eastwards towards the Meuse crossings in the vicinity of Dinant, and our forcescovering the crossings were in contact with advanced elements 4 miles east ofthe river on the 25th. We got the better of this fighting and the enemy was pushedback on a wide front between Marche and Givet.Despite powerful enemy attacks east of Monschau (10 miles S.E. of Eupen)our front has remained firm.There is nothing to report from the Ninth U.S. Army front.Northern Sector.25. Activity in this sector has again been confined to patrolling. The enemy has been active north of Hertogenbosch and his patrols crossed the Maas on the22nd and 23rd; on both occasions his forces were dispersed by our artillery.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)26. Along the Eighth Army front the only changes that have taken placein our forward positions during the period under review are around Bagnacavalloand to the north of Faenza. Near the former town the Canadians have, pushedon, occupying the town itself on the 21st. They are now established along theeast bank of the River Senio.To the north of Eaenza, New Zealand and British troops have been steadilyclearing the area which lies between the Lamone and Senio rivers. Progress hasbeen steady, but bad weather, in addition to the difficult terrain, has limited the speed of advance.Along the Fifth Army front activity has been confined to patrol work, exceptin the western sector, where the enemy has attacked our forward troops in theSercchio valley. To the north of Barga our forward elements have been forced tomake a limited withdrawal.  Fighting still goes on in this area. :The Eastern European Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.27. The Germans have reported a renewal of Russian attacks west ofJelgava (Latvia), claiming that they were repulsed with heavy Russian losses.Southern Sector.28.   The Russians gained more ground north and west of Miskolc.N.W. of Budapest, after a short pause, they resumed their advance and onthe 24th captured the railway junction of Levice; there they have reached theedge of a plain, which stretches westwards as far as Bratislava. The plain isintersected by a number of small rivers, which, should not, however, present anyserious obstacle to Russian progress; the Germans have been counter-attackingin order to prevent any further advance.On the 21st the Russians began a fresh attack in the area S.W. of Budapestwith the object of completing the encirclement of the city; in this they have succeeded. Breaking through the German defensive positions, they thrust north-wards and reached the southern bank of the Danube in the area of Esztergom,which was captured on the 26th. At the same time Russian troops penetrated intothe western suburbs of Budapest.Greece.A thens.28. British, Indian and Greek regular forces have continued clearingoperations in the city and piraeus; good progress has been made astride theroads, running S.W. from the city and a strip some 2 miles wide is nowfirmly held. A strong British attack, which included an amphibious assault, wasmade against the northern shore of the piraeus harbour on the 22nd, where slowbut successful progress has been made. E.L.A.S. resistance here has been increasingly bitter, in contrast to that in Greater Athens, where only localinsurgent troops are now thought to remain.More than 12 battalions of the recently recruited Greek National Guard arenow operating satisfactorily in support of our forces.[28905] b 2
Epirus ...30. Hostilities broke out between E.L.A.S. and Zervas forces on the 20th,and General Zervas is being forced to evacuate his troops to Corfu.Burma. .31. Our troops in the Arakan have made substantial advances southwardsagainst minor opposition. On the Mayu Peninsula pur troops, after a rapid andunopposed advance, entered Donbaik on the 23rd, and have advanced a further5 miles towards Foul Point. Further inland, our troops have reached positions12 miles south of Buthidaung, and in the Kaladan valley they have advanced toa point 12 miles east of Kyauktaw.Between the Chindwin and Irrawaddy rivers our troops have made consider-able advances from their bridgehead at Kalewa in the west and the area of Indawin the north. Advancing from Kalewa our troops, after having occupiedPyingaing, have pushed on a further 10 miles on the Ye-u Road. Leading troops from the north have reached a point 20 miles north of Ye-u.South of Bhamo, Chinese troops have made further slight progress towardsNamkhan 11 miles away.Pacific Theatre.Leyte.32. A communique from General MacArthur announces that the campaignon Leyte is now finished. All key-points on the island have been occupied, but some 30;000 Japanese, in small pockets, remain to be mopped up.During the last few days, U.S. forces advancing from north and south in theOrmoc Corridor made contact, and are now making rapid progress in clearing the Japanese remaining in the N.W. of the Island. During this process they have carried out a small amphibious operation against Palompon.During the two months&apos; campaign, 54,000 Japanese dead have been countedand 893 prisoners were taken. U.S. casualties were 2,623 killed, 8,422 wounded and 172 missing.Mindoro.33. There has been no ground fighting. U.S. forces are now operating-air bases on the Island.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.34. Fighter Command flew 64 defensive sorties against flying-bombs. TwoHe 111 launching aircraft were destroyed.Attacks on long range rocket sites in Holland are referred to in paragraph 36,and details of enemy activity against this country are reported under &quot; enemy activity and Home Security.&quot; -Home Waters.*35. Flome-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 731 sorties. One enemy aircraft was destroyed and 3 aircraft are missing. Off Norway, an attack wasmade by Mosquitoes on 2 medium-sized ships, both were set on fire, and oneleft sinking.Bomber Command aircraft laid sea mines.Western Europe.36. During the week ended dawn on the 27th, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F.(Air) flew 14,197 sorties and dropped 5,588 tons of bombs (average previous 4 weeks [8,659 sorties and 2,996 tons). In the week ended dawn on the 28th, bomber command and the U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew 6,579 sorties and dropped18,408 tons, and U.S. VIII Fighter Command flew 2,593 sorties. Fighter Com-mand flew 846 sorties, and a total of 2,224 sorties was flown by aircraft carryingsupplies to the Continent including the battle areas.
Five hundred and twenty-seven enemy aircraft were destroyed, and261 Allied aircraft are missing. (Average previous 4 weeks 164 and 149&apos;respectively.)Widespread fog over the United Kingdom, the Continent and western germany, on the first 2 days of the period, seriously hampered air operations against the German counter-offensive between Duren and Treves. With animprovement in the weather on the succeeding days, the scale of effort was considerable against this attack. Although restricted by fog over bases, bomber command aircraft carried out successful attacks by day and night againstrailway centres and airfields in the immediate rear of the attacking enemy forces,and large escorted forces of U.S. VIII Bomber Command aircraft attackedsuccessfully in daylight communication centres and bridges in the same area, and airfields in use by G.A.F. Medium bombers, fighter-bombers and fighters ofS.H.A.E.F. (Air) operated very successfully against enemy troops and transport,G.A.F. activity, both offensive and defensive by day and night, was on a considerably increased scale, and on one day over 900 single-engined fighters wereairborne.  A large number of enemy aircraft was destroyed in combat.On the 21st, Allied day operations were mainly limited to a small-scale attack,through cloud, by 91 Lancasters against enemy supplies and troop concentrationsat Treves (441 tons) with good results. Aircraft of U.S. VIII Bomber Commanddid not operate, and only a negligible number of sorties was flown by fighters and fighter-bombers of S.H.A.E.F. (Air). Operations in this sector of the front,on the following day, were confined to approximately 200 sorties by aircraft ofS.H.A.E.F. (Air) in the Treves area.Later in the week, a considerable scale of effort was made by aircraft of the3 Commands, although fog at the bases on some days prevented aircraft fromthe U.K. operating in strength. Railway centres supplying the German armiesattacking in the Duren-Treves area were heavily attacked. Bomber command aircraft obtained good results against Cologne (1,153 tons), Coblenz (917 tons),Rheydt (977 tons) and Bingen (315 tons). Rheydt was attacked by day in clearweather, with an excellent concentration; Cologne was attacked (in clear weather),on three occasions by day and night when the bombing was accurate. On 3 daysforces of Fortresses and Liberators of 397, 789 and 588 aircraft, heavily escorted,attacked numerous rail and communication centres. A total of 4,526 tons was dropped.Airfields at Essen/Mulheim, Dusseldorf/Lohausen, and Bonn/Hangelar were attacked by Lancasters and Halifaxes in clear weather. A total of 1,686 tonsof bombs was dropped and photographs show a large concentration of cratersacross all the airfields.In the Frankfurt area, 11 airfields in operational use by G.A.F. were attacked on one day by a considerable force of Fortresses heavily escorted. Over1,000 tons were dropped with excellent results. Reconnaissance to date showsthat the majority of the airfields were rendered unserviceable.Reaction by the G.A.F. to all these attacks was on a major scale, and on days, 75, 91 and 49 aircraft were destroyed by the bombers and the fighter escort. .Lancasters and Halifaxes of Bomber Command dropped 1,131 tons, in clearweather, on armour and troop concentrations at St. Vith and achieved an excellentbombing concentration.Medium and light bombers, fighters and fighter-bombers of S.H.A.E.F. (Air)attacked communications, armour, troop concentrations and railway bridges inthe counter-offensive zone in great strength. Over 5,500 tons were dropped, andon two days the scale of effort of all aircraft approached nearly 4,000 sorties.G.A.F. activity over this zone on some days amounted to 4/500 aircraft.A total of 246 aircraft was destroyed by aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) for184 missing or destroyed.Over 2,700 M.T. and 340 A.F.V. (including 77 tanks) were destroyed.Nearly 1,000 aircraft (of which 61 were towing gliders) dropped supplies totroops in the Bastogne area, and 117 transported troops from Marseilles to the battle area.A night attack was made by Lancasters on the synthetic oil plant at Politz;711 tons were dropped in clear weather, and a fair concentration of bombingwas developed.   Serious damage is shown by reconnaissance photographs.An attack was made on rocket-launching sites in the Hague area by aircraft of Fighter Command with excellent results.Note. Appendix VII gives some Raid Assessments.
Southern Europe.37. During the week ended dawn on the 26th, aircraft of M.A.A.F. flew7,578 sorties (including 2,004 by heavy bombers) and dropped 4,169 tons of bombs.Thirty-seven enemy aircraft were destroyed (33 on the ground) and 56 allied aircraft (including 32 bombers) are,missing.Italy. -38.

Four Allied aircraft are missing.The main efforts of the week were directed against enemy targets in central and Lower Burma.
In Central Burma Liberators, Mitchells and fighters provided full support to Allied troops. At least 17 bridges were destroyed or damaged and considerable damage was caused to camps, vehicles, supply areas and airfields.In Lower Burma Liberators dropped 272 -tons on Taungup and 70 tons ona jetty at Martaban, good concentrations being achieved. A total of 98 Mitchellsbombed stores areas and M.T. at Taungup with unobserved results; the railway and stores centres and a jetty at Henzada, where many bursts were seen and fires started; 3 railway bridges in the Natfcalin/Zigon area, where results werenot observed, and Hninpale railway bridge, which was partially destroyed.Beaufighters and Thunderbolts attacked a variety of targets, including river-craft, many of which were destroyed, gun positions and oil installations.In the Arakan 34 Mitchells bombed camps in the Kansauk district, while26 others bombed Thayettiabin and Myohaung. Fighters attacked communica-tions, supplies and other targets.Small-scale attacks were made on enemy targets in the North Shan Statesand the Chindwin.China Zone.45.

Fifteen enemy aircraft were destroyed and 2 Super Fortresses are missing.In China, Mitchells, Mustangs and Kittyhawks attacked roads, railways,dumps and airfields. At Hong Kong, 11 Mustangs sank a medium-sized ship and probably sank 3 other ships and a destroyer.Pacific.46. In the Philippines, the principal targets were airfields, especially thosein Negros and Luzon, on which heavy attacks were made daily. The weight ofthese attacks may be gauged by the fact that in one attack alone on Bacolod by liberators 161 tons of bombs were dropped with good results. A large numberof enemy aircraft was destroyed on the ground including 50 in an attack onClark Field (Manila). Fighters carried out many successful patrols. during a patrol over Mindoro 33 enemy fighters were destroyed in combat for the lossof one Allied fighter. Attacks were also made on enemy shipping; 2 medium-sized ships, 3 coasters and many small craft were sunk.In Borneo, 23 Liberators bombed Jesseltown airfield, and other aircraftbombed Tarakan airfield and an oil refinery at Miri.

APPENDIX VII.Allied Air Attacks.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Blechhammer. North synthetic oil plant (attacked on the 17th, 18th and19th December). Severe damage has been inflicted and it is estimated that the plant has been put out of action for at least a month. Both blower housesdestroyed and main buildings of water-gas plant probably sustained blast damage.Switch house half destroyed and gas holder badly damaged. Two cooling towersdamaged. Hits on briquetting plant. Main compressor house hit at west end.Several large workshops damaged. Damage to stores area at east end and labourcamp at north boundary. Craters among distillation units. As a result of the attack on the 2nd December no operational activity visible.South synthetic oil plant (attacked on the 12th, 17th, 18th and 19th December).General damage to workshops and labour camp buildings. No-fresh damage tovital installations. Little evidence of repair and no apparent plant activityvisible.Bonn/Hangelar Airfield.- As a result of the Bomber Command attack onthe 24th/25th December the landing ground was blanketed by a concentration ofcraters extending into the hangar area and damaging six open shelters and atleast six aircraft. Many craters have also been made on the north dispersal area and on perimeter and taxi tracks.Brux. Synthetic oil plant (attacked the 16th and 20th December). Photo-graphs obscured by smoke. Some new damage visible at west side of target area.Large concentration of craters close to plant areas.Cologne/Nippes Marshalling Yard. -The Bomber Gommand attack on24th/25th December cut all the tracks in the sorting sidings,- and disrupted tracksin both the northbound forwarding and southbound reception sidings. Thelocomotive depot and repair shops and the wagon repair shops at the north endof the yard have been further damaged, as well as the wagon repair shops inthe central yard area. A considerable amount of rolling stock has been derailedand damaged.Dusseldorf ILohausen A airfield. As a result of the Bomber Command attack onthe 24th December, craters are thickly distributed over the entire landing ground,with at least 85 on the three runways, the majority obstructing the N.E.-S.W.strip. A large hangar in the S.W. corner of the field is 4/5ths gutted and sixaircraft have been damaged.Ehrang. As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 23rd December everyline in the railway centre has been cut in several places, many wagons derailedand debris scattered over the area. The next day fires were still burning in thesorting sidings and three explosions each caused craters approximately 80 feetin diameter. The bridge which conveys the track system over the River Moselleis damaged, and a large unidentified factory to the east of the reception sidingshas been heavily damaged.Euskirchen Marshalling Yard. All traffic is blocked by the destruction of lines.Essen/Mulheim Airfield. The Bomber Command attack on the 24th Decem-ber caused a large concentration of craters across the field, and damaged the airfield buildings on tlaO HOT&quot; th and west sides of the landing ground.Ettinghausen Airfield. Craters are well dispersed over the entire airfield,which now appears unserviceable.Frankfurt/Rhein-Main Airfield. The U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 24thDecember covered the north-eastern two-fifths of the field with craters and severely damaged the sole hangar and the airport building. Two aircraft havebeen damaged.Geissen A ir field. Many craters are visible on the landing area and the fieldis probably unserviceable.
Gdynia. As a result of the Bomber Command attack on the 18th/19thDecember the following items of damage have been caused, although the poor quality of the cover renders exact assessment difficult :- Free Customs Basin.Schlesien class battleship appears to be down by the stern, with three smallvessels alongside.Coal Basin.M/V 390 ft. down by the stern; 200 ft./250 ft. M/V alongside listing heavily.-No. 3 Basin.M/V 400 ft./450ft. in floating dock possibly damaged, small floating dockalongside sunk by direct hit with small vessel inside.Industrial Canal.One M/V 200 ft. sunk, probably resting on bottom, tug alongside. Harbourcraft at east end of Timber Harbour possibly damaged.New Shipyard (south-west end of Industrial Canal).Large floating dock damaged at south-west end; the access jetty to it issevered, and one of the two large cranes is no longer visible. Small floating dock :sunk at one end by direct hit. One large building : hole in roof. One mediumbuilding : severely damaged in four places.Indian Wharf.Warehouse : central part of roof destroyed.Marshalling Yard.Sixteen direct hits on sidings : several tracks severed and rolling stockdamaged and displaced at two points.Holland.Ijmuiden. As a result of the attack by&apos;Bomber Command with 12,000 tallboybombs on the 15th December, the E/R boat pens have suffered further severe damage. On the western half part of the roof over four of the pen entrances hascollapsed, the area measuring 120 ft. by 130 ft. and a further crater in the roofmeasuring 15 ft. appears to have caused complete perforation.Innsbruck (attacked 25th December). A good concentration in centre andE. end of W. yard started fires and damaged repair shed, rolling-stock and tracks.S. choke point of main yard probably blocked by hits. Good concentration inarea of gun positions.Kirch Gons Airfield. Craters are well dispersed over the entire field,rendering it unserviceable.Merzhausen Airfield. A belt of craters lies across the airfield from N.E. toS.W. and use of the field appears improbable at present.Nidda Airfield. Bombs fell in the central portion of the airfield effectivelyblocking landings or take-offs.Oswiecim. Synthetic oil plant and rubber works. (Attacked 18thDecember.) Scattered hits on plant, warehouses and labour camp. Main weightof attack fell just SW. of plant.  Repair activity noted.Pilsen. Skoda Works. (Attacked 16th and 20th December.) Photographsobscured by smoke. Severe damage probably inflicted on large machine shops and railway lines entering plant.Politz. The synthetic oil plant is partly obscured by a smoke screen which prevents full asessment of damage caused by the Bomber Command attack on the21st December. Serious items of damage, however, can be seen, the mostimportant being in the main power station, where the smoke ducts have been severely affected and one of the 320 ft. chimneys felled; the fall of this chimneyhas cut the adjoining pipebridge carrying the main steam supply to the watergas plant.  Another pipebridge has been cut by a hit on the end of the carbonising
ovens; there is damage to the gas plant and to a gas holder, while the highpressure pipe connections between the compressor house and the gas washingbuilding have been cut.Photographs taken a few hours before the raid showed a high level of activity in the works; the day after the raid visible activity was so slight that production appeared to have ceased.Trier. As a result of the Bomber Command attacks, all lines leading south-from the railway centre have been cut as well as lines leading into the goodsdepot. There is heavy damage to the tracks and rolling-stock in the stationsidings and to facilities in the locomotive repair depot. Partial cover of the ordnance depots shows that 25 small storage-type buildings have been destroyed or severely damaged.Wels Railway Centre. -All through lines cut and light damage caused toroundhouse. Good concentration of hits has cut all sidings except two in northernportion. 50/60 wagons destroyed. Fires and some damage seen in city south oftarget.
