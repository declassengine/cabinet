(An outline map is included as an inset.)General.23. A successful attack on the northern flank of the Ardennes salient hasresulted in the cutting of the enemy&apos;s northerly lateral supply route. On thesouthern flank fierce enemy counter-attacks have continued in the vicinity ofBastogne.In the Saar, the enemy has made a considerable penetration S.E. of Bitschebut U.S. troops are containing his attacks.North of Strasbourg, an enemy bridgehead across the Rhine has been practi-cally eliminated after three days&apos; fighting, but, south of the city, an attack fromthe north of the Colmar pocket has made considerable progress.Southern Sector.24. On the 7th, the enemy attacked northwards along the west bank ofthe Rhine in the Selestat area; this thrust, carried out by infantry with somearmoured support, made considerable progress on both sides of the Rhine-Rhone
canal and has reached to within 12 miles of Strasbourg. Three small towns havebeen evacuated by the French. On the 5th, the enemy crossed the Rhine inbattalion strength some 12 miles north of Strasbourg and penetrated westwardsfor some 5 miles capturing several villages. Some armour was later ferried overin support. Allied forces have since recaptured all but one village which has changed hands several times.The Seventh U.S. Army is now containing the attacks along the Saar front,but  has  withdrawn.....from the Wissembourg area to the Maginot defences.Although the enemy has made little progress in this attack east of Saarguemines,he has effected a penetration some 8 miles deep on a 10-mile front in the Bitschearea. This penetration, which at one time severed the Haguenau-Saarguemineshighway is being slowly reduced.Central Sector.25. In the Ardennes, the battle on the south flank has been one of attack and counter-attack by both sides, with no significant changes of position untilthe end of the week, When the Third U.S. Army made limited gains in theBastogne area. Enemy attacks both east and west of the town have beencontinuous.On the northern flank the attack launched by the First U.S. Army east ofHotton on the 3rd, has made good progress and, with the support of british forces on its right, advances of from 5 to 8 miles have been made on a 20-milefront. The enemy reacted strongly to these attacks and resistance has remainedvery stubborn on the left, but on the right has been decreasing since the 7th.La Roche fell on the 10th, and the enemy is withdrawing eastwards from the area.Northern Sector.26. There has been continued patrol activity along the line of the lowerMaas, and a small enemy bridgehead in the Venraij area has been liquidated.Italy.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)27. The week has seen the extension of the Eighth Army&apos;s right flankalmost to the southern shores of Lake Comacchio, at the same time as the enemysalient east of the Senio was pinched but by the joint efforts of Canadian andBritish troops.On the 4th, Canadian armoured units secured two small jDridgeheads overthe Bonofica canal south of Lake Comacchio, and after dealing with a counter-attack, pressed on to occupy San Alberto the following day without opposition.By the 6th, forward positions lay along the south bank of the Reno River, andthe flooded area between Ravenna and Lake Comacchio had thus largely been cleared.At the same time as this was going on, Canadian infantry, together withthe British formation immediately to the north of Highway 9, were squeezingout the enemy salient east of Cotignola and Solarola. These operations were so successful that by the 8th . our forward positions lay along the east bank of theSenio.Since then, there has. been nothing to report anywhere along the front.Bad weather with frost and fog has been prevalent.The Eastern European Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.28. In Latvia the Germans claim to have halted the Russian attacks; they state they have broken into the Russian positions at one point in a counter-attack.Central Sector.29. The Germans report lively fighting by both sides in the Vistulabridgehead.Southern Sector.30.   The German counter-attack, which began on the 1st, with the object of breaking through to the trapped German garrison in Budapest from the N.W.,is continuing with undiminished fury.    Strong armoured forces are being[28982] &apos; &apos;    &quot;... b 2
employed, including two S.S. Panzer divisions which were recently transferred from the Central Front to this sector. The Germans claim to have advancedmore than 25 miles and to have captured the town of Esztergom on the southernbank of the Danube; they are now probably about 15 miles from the capital.Russian progress along the north bank of the Danube is being maintained,and they have advanced to within 4 miles of Komarno, the main supply base forthe German forces engaged in the Budapest counter-attack.- :   Inside Budapest itself German resistance is still. bitter, but about half ofthe city is now in Russian hands.   The bulk of the enemy&apos;s forces are in the. suburb of Pest, on the east bank of the DanubeGreece.A ttica.31. Our offensive against E.L.A.S. in the northern suburbs of Athens,which started on the 2nd, succeeded in driving the rebels out of the capital bythe 5th. The rebels were forced to withdraw in some disorder, and the rapiditywith which Allied armoured columns followed them up prevented them holdingany defensive position in Attica.Armoured columns are now patrolling Boetia and Attica between Levadeia,Thebes, Chalcis and Lavrion.Corfu.32.   A British Commando is now established on Corfu.Yugoslavia.33. The Germans have continued their withdrawal north-westwards fromMontenegro in spite of harassing attacks by the Partisans.In &quot;northern Slovenia the enemy has recently carried out an offensive,consisting of a number of minor operations, with the object of clearing his communications.Burma.34. The whole of Akyab Island fell into our hands without opposition afterthe landing on the 3rd. Landings have been made by our troops in the area ofPonnagyun from the Tawbya River and patrols have reported Pauktaw, Sunye,and the Middle and West Boronga Islands clear of the enemy. In the KaladanValley our troops have encountered stubborn resistance 10 miles S.E. ofKyauktaw.Further progress has been made between the Chindwin and the Irrawaddy.From the area east of Ywathit, Allied troops have advanced some 20 miles duringthe week and cut the road and railway Ye-U-Monywa at the village of Budalin,where minor clashes have occurred. Further to the N.E., other troops advancingfrom Ye-U have cleared the Ye-U-Shwebo Road. Troops from the Kabo Weirarea occupied Kinu on the 8th. Other Allied troops entered Shwebo itself on the7th.Allied forces advancing down the eastern bank of the Irrawaddy have advanced a further 7 miles and occupied a village 19 miles south of Tagaung.Chinese and U.S. troops continue to close in on Namhkam.China.35.

On the 3rd U.S. troops from Mindoro carried out a small unopposedlanding on the S.W. coast of Marinduque Island. This Island lies about 30 miles east of Mindoro and 100 miles S.E. of Manila.
Small U.S. parties, conducting shore to shore amphibious operations, havemade further landings on the east and west coasts of Mindoro. Some oppositionhas been encountered on the extreme N.W. coast.On Leyte, fairly heavy fighting is reported in a pocket on the N.W. coast,and inland from Palompon. 63,495 enemy dead have now been counted on the island and 473 prisoners taken!On the morning of the 9th, U.S. troops landed on the west coast of Luzonin Lingayen Gulf. According to press reports the landing was almost unopposedand a 15-mile bridgehead has already been established; the Americans have secured the town of San Fabian, on the S.E. corner of the Gulf.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.37.

Thirty-four enemy aircraft were destroyed;206 Allied aircraft are missing but some of these may have landed safely on theContinent.Adverse weather conditions continued to restrict operations.In the battle area, air activity was on a very reduced scale. On the 5th,medium bombers dropped 302 tons of bombs on 6 communication centres in thecentral sector. Results were unobserved except at Houffalize and Gouvy whereexcellent results were achieved. When night came, a force of Lancasters andMosquitoes attacked troop concentrations at Houffalize and 117 Mosquitoesenemy movement in the Malmedy area. At Houffalize, 425 tons were dropped,through cloud, on markers which were accurately placed. The attack on theMalmedy area was carried out mainly by navigational aids and few results were observed. Fighter and fighter-bombers, whenever weather permitted,provided support for Allied troops, attacked enemy transport, and other targets and flew offensive sweeps. About 90 locomotives, 750 road and rail vehicles and several tanks and gun positions were destroyed.Heavy attacks were made on. communication and industrial centres inGermany, the principal targets being Hanover (2,420 tons), Munich (2,176 tons),Hanau (1,810 tons), Ludwigshafen (845 tons), Neuss (688 tons), Cologne (602 tons),Coblenz (422 tons) and Frankfurt (410 tons). Between 250 and 300 tons were dropped on each of the following: Hamm, Bitburg, Karlsruhe and Rastatt.In addition, 1,664 tons were dropped on road and railway bridges, mainly betweenCologne and Karlsruhe.Most of these targets were attacked on Pathfinder technique with unobservedresults but some, including Hanover, Munich and Ludwigshafen, were bombedin better weather. -&apos; .At Hanover, which was bombed twice on the same night. 8/10ths to 10/10thscloud was encountered during the first attack and most crews bombed on sky
markers which were well concentrated. A number of explosions were reported and many fires wrere started which were visible for a considerable distance onthe homeward route. When the second attack followed some 2\ hours later,the weather had improved with clear sky and good visibility. On arrival over the target, crews found fires still burning from the first attack, which they proceeded to extend. Soon a pall of smoke hung over the town which practically obliteratedall ground detail.   The attack had every indication of being very successful.Munich also was.bombed twice in one night. Weather was good when thefirst attack was made, except for slight haze and broken cloud. Marking wasaccurate and bombing concentrated and many fires were seen. During the second attack, there was 10/10ths cloud which did not obscure the glow of fires fromthe previous attack. Bombing was effected chiefly by the aid of sky markers which appeared thin and scattered to start with, but some crews attacked on instruments.As the attack developed a better concentration was achieved although report?indicate that the bombing was somewhat scattered.At Ludwigshafen, which was bombed in daylight, flak was intense and the attack appeared to be rather scattered although hits are claimed on the railway centre and the eastern part of the town.Nearly 700 tons were dropped on 6 airfields in the Cologne and Coblenzareas, with results which were mainly unobserved.Mosquitoes carried out small-scale attacks on a few targets, including Berlin(139 tons) and Spitfires attacked long-range rocket sites in the Hague area, wheremany bombs were seen to burst in the target areas.In France, a force of Lancasters and Mosquitoes dropped 1,637 tons in a night attack on troop concentrations at Royan, near Bordeaux. Weather was clear and a good concentration of bombing was achieved.Aircraft carrying supplies to the Continent flew 626 sorties.There were few operations by German long-range bombers or ground-attackaircraft during the week. Such operations as occurred were directed againsttactical targets. Tactical reconnaissances over the battle area was on a slightly lower level than in the previous week.

During the month 281 ships were convoyed without lossby enemy action in 42 of the principal Mediterranean convoys.)

M.L. 466 damaged by mine off Zeebrugge.The following casualties to naval personnel have been reported: Officers :  22 killed; 3 wounded.Ratings : 56 killed; 12 wounded.Appendix VI will be published periodically.APPENDIX VII.Allied Air Attacks.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Bad Kreuznach.- Photographs taken on the 6th January show that heavy damage was caused in the marshalling yard and to rolling-stock as a result ofthe U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 25th December and the 2nd January. More than30 craters can be seen in the sidings, the goods depot has been destroyed and the engine round house severely damaged. In the centre of the town the railjunction area has been heavily hit, the main station being gutted, a road overrail bridge demolished and tracks cut in many places. The main lines to Mainzand to Bingen have been cut at many points. There is also severe damage in thetown itself south-west of the main station, and several industrial plants havebeen affected, among them the town electricity works and gas works. Administra-tive and other public buildings have also suffered severely.Cologne I Gremberg Marshalling Yard. Interpretation of photographsrendered difficult by haze after the Bomber Command attack of the 28th Decembershows a concentration of craters extending across the central and southernportions of the marshalling yard. Damage is heaviest in the north and southboundsorting sidings, where all the tracks have been cut and a large quantity of rolling-stock damaged or derailed. Most of the tracks in the northbound reception andsouthbound forwarding sidings have been cut, and five rail over road bridges havebeen damaged or destroyed. In addition, the locomotive depot has been severely damaged. The marshalling yard sidings are 100 per cent, unserviceable forthrough working, and the through running lines for traffic to the south-east arein a similar state.Fulda. Photographs taken on the 6th January show that, as a result of theU.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 27th December and the 3rd January, severe damage has been caused in the marshalling yard, where nearly all the &quot;tracks have been cut and a quantity of rolling-stock damaged or derailed. Railway facilities,including the southern round-house and the railway workshops, have been affected,and the main station has been damaged; the tyre factory of Gummiwerke has again been hit. There are several incidents of business and residential damage in the south central part of the town.
Hamburg. The varying quality of the photographs and smoke in many parts renders detailed assessment of damage caused by the U.S.A.A.F. attack ofthe 31st December impossible. Fires can be seen in the storage tank area of the oil refinery of Rhenania Ossag Mineralolwerke, and the plants of DeutschePetroleum and Ernst Schliemanns Olwerke are completely obscured by smoke; itcan be said, however, that all three plants have been hit. Damage has been caused in the Blohm and Voss shipyard, where the boiler house and power station, thefoundry, the diesel engine testing shop, as well as other small buildings, have been affected. Two 250-feet U-boats have been sunk, another, is on fire and anunfinished liner has been further damaged. Damage and/or fires oan also be seen atthe shipbuilding yard - of Deutsche Werft, the naval shipbuilding yard ofHowaldtswerke, the Slodin Schoer shipyard, the oil refinery of Albrecht and the oil storage depot of Kohlen Schift Hafen, as well as to many warehouses and business and residential property.Further photographs show that as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the31st December, the wax extraction plant of the Rhenania Ossag Mineralolwerke,which had been previously damaged, is now partly destroyed and a medium-sizedbuilding to the south has been seriously damaged. Another medium-sizedbuilding of the asphalt treatment and storage plant has suffered fresh damage and three or four small tanks in the north-east oil storage area have been destroyed. Some railway wagons in the loading sidings have been damaged orderailed.Subsequent photographs taken on the 5th January show additional damage caused by the same attack. In the Rhenania Ossag Mineralolwerke some ten oil storage tanks have been gutted or damaged and the whole plant is seen to beinactive. In the Blohm and Voss shipyard damage has been caused to the gasworks, where a gas holder and four buildings have been destroyed or damaged.In the Deutsche Petroleum damage is confined to the south-western half of the plant, and an unidentified building in the processing plant has been partially destroyed and at least four storage tanks damaged.Homburg. Though assessment of damage is hampered by snow, it can beseen that as a result of the U.S.AA.F. attacks on the 27th and 28th Decemberabout half of the locomotive depot in the marshalling yard has been heavily damaged, and the goods depot has been affected. Tracks in the station sidingshave been cut and at least three of the four tracks connecting this yard with theAlstadt marshalling yard have also been cut. Moderate damage has been causedthroughout the Alstadt marshalling yard by the U.S.A.A.F. attacks of the30th November and 23rd December. Three through tracks and many more inthe reception and sorting sidings have been cut, and at least 20 goods wagonsdamaged.   Some damage has also been caused to the transhipment sheds.Krefeld A airfield.-As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 31st December,two hangars and eight medium-sized barracks have been severely damaged or partly destroyed, 12 blast shelters have been hit and a large number of cratershave been made in the north-east and south-east dispersal areas, some of whichextend on to the landing ground.Ulm. As a result of the Bomber Command attack on the 23rd December,the western half of the city centre is devastated and the main- station buildings are gutted. The works of Klockner Humboldt Deutz, makers of fire-fightingequipment and A.F.V;s, has suffered heavy damage and the large building inthe railway repair shops is almost entirely destroyed. Other industrial premises and the marshalling yard are also very severely damaged.[28982]D
