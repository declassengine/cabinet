THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War. Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. Copy No.   3 6W.P. (45) 14.10th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.PRELIMINARY HISTORIES  OF  THE  WAR.Memorandum by the Minister of Education(Chairman of the Committee for the Control of the Official Histories).1. I look forward with confidence to the publication of the official historyof the present war being completed in a shorter time than was the case at theend of the last war. On the last occasion the official Service histories of the last war ran to over 50 volumes. The last volumes oil Naval and Air operations were published in 1931 and 1934 respectively, while there are yet outstandingone or two volumes of the official history of the Army. While We cannot reckonon final volumes of our present series being published until several years afterthe end of hostilities, in the Far East, it will be seen that we have arranged a programme of immediate publication of preliminary histories covering aboutthe whole field which should be able to be issued within one or two years.afterthe end of hostilities in Europe.2. As soon as the war in Europe ends there will be a demand, both in thiscountry and overseas, for a record of Britain&apos;s war effort. This demand cannotbe adequately met unless a record is produced based on official sources of informa-tion. But it is clear that owing to the extent of the ground to be covered and theevidence to be sifted, the definitive official history cannot possibly be completedsoon enough to meet this demand.3. The Committee for the Control of the Official Histories after muchthought have come to the conclusion that this situation would best be met&apos; by thepublication, as soon as possible after the end of the war in Europe, of about a dozen volumes designed to give a general and preliminary conspectus of the war effort. This series of volumes would be additional, and anterior, to the definitiveofficial histories.4. The following is an outline of what is proposed. I deal first with thescheme as it affects the Services.(a) General Character of the Volumes.It would be made clear in a prefatory note that while these preliminaryvolumes were based on the best information available at the time of writing, itmust be accepted that when more data had been collated (including in particularinformation obtained from enemy sources) some of the judgments expressed in them might have to be revised.(b) Plan of the Series.It is proposed that the series should include two volumes giving a broadlychronological history of the work done by the Royal Navy up to the end of theGerman war, and two or three volumes serving the same purpose for the R.A.F.The authors of these volumes would be selected by the Admiralty and AirMinistry respectively subject to the approval of the Committee for the Control ofthe Official Histories. The War Office would bring out another volume dealingwith the development and organisation of the Army. The operational history ofthe Army, however, can only be told as a series of campaigns. The history of a modern campaign would obviously be incomplete if it concentrated exclusivelyon the record of one of the three Services taking part in it.   While, therefore, in&apos;   [28976]
the three Campaign volumes in the series the main emphasis would be laid on theArmy, their authors would be selected by the War Office in consultation with theAdmiralty and Air Ministry; they would have access to Naval and R.A.F.information and arrangements would be made to ensure that adequate attention was paid to the part played by the other two Services, and that the aspect of inter-Service co-operation throughout the campaign was duly stressed.(c) Method of Writing.Each volume dealing with the Services would be the work of a writer ofrepute known to the general public, who would work in close collaboration withthe narrators who are already at work in the Historical Sections of the Servicespreparing first narratives of operations and campaigns.(d) Terms of Appointment, Publication, &amp;c.The authors nominated by the Service Departments would be approved bythe Chairman of the Official Histories Committee before appointment. Thehistories would be published by the Stationery Office, copyright remaining withHis Majesty&apos;s Government, and the authors remunerated for their services by a lump sum fee.(e) Time of Publication.It is hoped that the volumes would be published within 18 months or so ofthe conclusion of hostilities with Germany.(f) Editorial Arrangements.An Editor-in-Chief would be appointed for the whole series of preliminarymilitary histories. As there is a danger of overlapping, particularly betweenthe Naval and R.A.F. histories on the one hand and the Campaign volumes onthe other, ?I think that this post could best be filled by an historian of high standingwho had the confidence of the three Services and could prevent unnecessaryduplication and see that the series as a whole presented a coherent picture ofthe ground strategy of the war. It would also be the Editor&apos;s duty to make sure that there was no unnecessary duplication or overlapping between the volumes,and to give the authors help in the various problems likely to be encountered ifthe whole series of volumes is to be brought out within the period contemplated.It would be an advantage, therefore, if the historian chosen had had some experience of the &quot;war-time administrative machine.Civil Histories.5. The above paragraph relates primarily to the Service histories. Theposition as regards civil histories differs inasmuch as a team of historians isalready at work in Departments under the general supervision of ProfessorHancock on preparing accounts of the civil war effort. The primary purposeof these accounts is to fund experience for Government use; consequently allthe volumes are being prepared in the first instance for confidential print. Butit is hoped that most of the accounts now being written will be found suitablefor publication after the war. without substantial alteration.6. It is proposed to meet the needs for preliminary histories in the civilsphere by arranging for three of the historians already employed to producesynoptic volumes from the material already collected.List of Preliminary Volumes.7. I attach a tentative list of the proposed volumes, together with a firstlist of suggested authors. No final choice of authors has yet been made for theService volumes, and the names are submitted merely as indicating the type ofwriter whom it is intended to employ.Conclusion.8. If the scheme is to go forward the authors of the military volumes mustbe selected and appointed. Before this step is taken I seek the general approvalof the War Cabinet to the principle of the scheme proposed, points of detail
being left for discussion between the Service Ministers and myself. ; The service ministers have already accepted my proposals in principle.9. There is not the same need to take a decision on publication of thesynoptic volumes dealing with the civilian war effort, since the authors are already in. Government employment. Nevertheless, I hope my colleagues will also give general approval to this part of the scheme.Ministry of Education,Belgrave Square, S.W. 1,10th January, 1945.q.APPENDIX.PROPOSED SERIES OF PRELIMINARY HISTORIES OF THE WAR.Possible Authors.(i) Royal Navy.
