THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted&apos;for the War Cabinet.  January 1945.WORLD ORGANISATION.Report by the Chairman of the Armistice and Post-War Committee.1. On the 20th December, 1944; the War Cabinet had before them certainpapers dealing with the subject of voting in the Security Council of the world organisation, upon which no agreed recommendation had been reached atDumbarton Oaks. In particular, the War Cabinet gave consideration to aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 747),which contained the text of a telegram sent by the President to Premier Stalm,in which he put forward a compromise solution. The War Cabinet came to noconclusion on the merits of the Presidents suggested compromise, but agreedthat the opinion of Dominion Governments should be sought. A telegram was accordingly sent to the Dominion Governments, and the Armistice and Post-war committee, with the agreement of the Prime Minister, met to consider the Presi-dent&apos;s proposal, and to formulate recommendations to the War Cabinet on theattitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt. The matter is oneof some urgency, since although the President has had no reply from premier stalin, the State Department have indicated to the Foreign Office that thePresident would in the meantime welcome the views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.2. As explained in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,-the Presidents proposal is in essentials the same as compromise &quot;A,&quot;as defined in paragraphs 14 and 15 of Sir Alexander Cadogan&apos;s Memorandumof the 22nd November (A.P.W. (44) 117). The Committee feel that there is muchto be said in favour of this compromisee. It is evident that if a disputeinvolving one of the Great Powers comes before the Security Council, the world organisation will have failed unless the dispute can be settled by agreement among the Great Powers. Action involving the use of force against a great power would result inevitably in a major war, and no rules governing voting in the Security Council can alter that fact. The Presidents proposal, however,would ensure that a Great Power could not prevent the ventilation before theWorld Organisation of any question raised by a smaller Power. During theprocess of investigation by the Security Council, full publicity would be givento the questions at issue, and ample opportunity would be afforded to world opinion to make itself felt. Considerable pressure would thus be exerted onthe parties to the dispute to seek a solution by negotiation or other peaceful means. It would still be open to the Great Power concerned voluntarily tosubmit the matter to settlement by the Security Council. At the same time,there would not be in. the background the prospect of the Great Power being-placed against its will in the dock, and thus finding itself in a position fromwhich it would be difficult to withdraw without humiliation.3. On a realistic assessment of the position the Committee is of the opinionthat the Presidents proposal should be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The replies of the Canadian and South African Governments are at Annex 1.It will be seen that Canada neither approves nor disapproves the compromise,while recognising that it may be the best obtainable solution. South Africa isprepared to accept it. Australia and New Zealand have not yet replied, andtheir views have been urgently requested.[28974] bSECRET. Copy No.   9W.P. (45) 12.5th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.
4. Unless serious objections are raised by Australia or New Zealand theway seems clear, therefore, for us to inform the President that we will supporthis proposal, and at Annex II is a draft telegram from the Foreign Office to washington. The Committee do not consider it advisable that the views of HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be conveyed to Premier Stalin until the latter hasreplied to the Presidents proposal.5. There are two further matters concerning the World Organisation whichhave been considered by the Armistice and Post-War Committee. The first isthe Russian -proposal that the 16 Soviet Socialist Republics should all be originalmembers. During the Dumbarton Oaks discussions, the United States putforward the proposal that the original members of the organisation should bethe United and Associated Nations. The &quot; Associated Nations &quot; in the Americanview are the States which have broken off relations with the Axis, and which havebeen invited to recent international conferences, namely, Egypt, Venezuela, Chile,Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay and Iceland. Turkey would nowpresumably come into this category. The Russians resisted this proposal, and put forward their own as a counter-proposal.6. The Committee feel that, although the Soviet proposal is most objection-able, it would be very difficult for His Maj.esty&apos;s Government to argue strongly against it. On paper, the Russian case is a strong one. The Soviet Republicshave their own Foreign Ministers, the right to secede, their own armed forces,the right to enter into agreements with other countries, and the right to exchangediplomatic and consular representatives with them. On paper, therefore, theSoviet Republics have a greater measure of autonomy in foreign affairs than hasIndia, The Committee therefore suggest that if the Soviet Government pressesits claim we should leave it to the United States, if they so desire, to maintainthe opposite view, and to conduct the argument. If the United States Governmentremains resolute in opposing the Russians on this point, and declines toparticipate in a World Organisation on that basis, we could say that we feel bound to.support them in the absence of positive evidence that the 16 Republicsdo enjoy any real measure of independence. If, however, the U.S.S.R, and theUnited States can produce some compromise acceptable to both of them, we, too,might accept it, provided it does not exclude India from the World Organisation.In the meanwhile, the Committee recommends that the position should be explained to Dominion Governments, and their views, and that of the viceroy of India, should be obtained.7. The second point which requires consideration is consultation with theFrench Government. So far they have not been brought into discussions on theWorld Organisation at all. It is clear that they will have to be consulted beforematters go much further, but the Committee suggest that we should take no action in the matter until after the next meeting between the Prime Minister,the President and Premier Stalin.8.   To sum up, the Committee recommend : (a) That the telegram at Annex II should be despatched to Washington,signifying our support for the Presidents proposal.(b) That if in the forthcoming discussions the Russians press their claimto the inclusion as original members of the World Organisation ofthe 16 Soviet Socialist Republics, we should leave it to the americans to make the running, giving them such support as we can.(c) That in the meanwhile the Dominion Governments and the viceroy should be informed of the Russian proposal, and should be askedto express their views.(d) That no initiative should be taken by us to bring the French Governmentinto consultation on the World Organisation until after the next meeting between the Prime Minister, the President and premier stalin.(On behalf of the Committee),C.

ANNEX I.Reply from Canada, dated 22nd December, 1944.(No. 245.)1. We recognise that a compromise along lines proposed by president roosevelt may be the best attainable solution of the problem of voting procedure in the Security Council. It would, however, still leave the Great Powers abovethe law proposed for all other States in relation to the central function of theCouncil of dealing with threats to peace. Furthermore, it could conceivablyencourage a permanent member to turn a difference with another State at onceinto a threat to the peace under Chapter VIII B, in order to prevent its considera-tion by the Security Council under Chapter VIII A. At this stage we do not feel called upen either to approve or to disapprove the suggestion.2. We recognise the importance of seeking to meet the views of the state department on timing set forth in paragraph 6 of your telegram.3. We feel, however, that before the draft proposals are formally submittedas a basis for a general conference a further effort should be made to meet thedifficulties which we have already brought to your notice in connection with theposition of the more important secondary States. These difficulties centre around(a) the selection of non-permanent members of the Council and (b) the authorityof the Council to demand positive and perhaps drastic action from member Statesnot represented on it in order to enforce its decisions. The activities of theLatin American- grouj) at the Chicago Aviation Conference increase our concern that it may prove impossible to amend the proposals in the desired direction at ageneral conference. We consider that there is a greater chance of securingapproval if the amendments are included in the draft at this stage of discussion between the Great Powers and before its presentation to other Governments. Weconsider that such amendments would increase the authority of the security council and thereby improve its effectiveness. We therefore hope that thismatter will be pressed if the early meeting proposed by the President between representatives of the United Kingdom, United States and Soviet Governmentstakes place.4.   We have received information that General de Gaulle informed the soviet authorities while in Moscow that he thought it was vital for the security of Franceand for the operation of the general organisation that the &apos;&apos; Middle powers should be effectively associated with the enforcement of peace.   The Russians are said to have indicated that they did not dissent.5. We intend shortly to submit a statement of our views on these points to the United States and Soviet Governments and perhaps to some others. Whileother parts of the proposals seem to us to require expansion or amendmentbefore they can be incorporated in the Charter, most of these further questionscan probably be considered satisfactorily at a general conference and need not beraised at this stage.6. In my telegram No. 188 of 28th September, to Mr. Churchill, I suggestedthat it would be difficult to secure acceptance at this time of permanent andindefinite obligations to assist in all circumstances in the enforcement of settle-ments prescribed by the Council. Mr. Churchill, in his speech in the House ofCommons on the same day, indicated that he thought the temporary arrangements to bridge transition period were essential. The public reception accorded to theDumbarton Oaks proposals in many countries strengthens our belief that this approach has much to commend it. We should be glad to learn whether you intend to put forward proposals to this end at the projected tripartite meeting.Reply from South Africa, dated 30th December, 1944.World Security Organisation.With reference to your Circular telegram D. No. 1827 my Governmenthave asked me to inform you that (1) They are convinced that the Russian point of view should be met ifprogress with the World Organisation is to be made. They therefore have no objection to President Roosevelt&apos;s proposal if it proves accept-able to Russia.
(2) They attach great importance to United States&apos; adhesion and would,therefore, also agree to timing proposed in Section 6 for the general conference.(3) The question of the extent to which the security Council could bindother Powers to positive drastic action without their consent willcall for careful consideration and this matter might also be fruitfullyconsidered at the suggested tripartite meeting. In any case, it willbe a matter for the General Conference and will no doubt presentgreat difficulty. But it is a separate question from that of unanimityamong the Great Powers, which is the crux in the present difference of views and should not be mixed up with it.(4) They feel great difficulty about Canada&apos;s proposal with regard toimportant secondary Powers. This new category will raise muchheartburning and may prove even more troublesome than the unanimityquestion. There will be violent gate-crashing for this second-classgroup. In the League of Nations there was much trouble over similarissues and it will be remembered how Brazil prevented the election of Germany to &quot;a permanent seat on the Council and this created a situation with far-reaching after-consequences. The question which canada raises should be settled by the good sense of the world organisation in actual practice without attempting to create afavoured class of secondary Powers. Questions of status are usuallymore difficult to solve than the more important ones of policy.(5) It might be very advisable for the British Group to thrash out among themselves the two questions in (3) and (4) above at a preliminaryLondon gathering which might be arranged somewhat in advance ofthe International Conference.I have sent copies of this message to the other High Commissioners in london for repetition, if they so desire, to their respective Governments.ANNEX TI.Draft Telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington.YOUR telegram Nos. 6869 [of 26th December] and 35 [of 2nd January].1. You may inform Mr. Stettinius that His Majesty&apos;s Government areprepared to accept the Presidents proposed compromise.2. They are not quite clear as to the precise effect of the application to paragraph 1 of Chapter VIII,&quot;Section C of the rule that parties to a dispute should not vote, but they do not anticipate any difficulty on this score.3. With special reference to paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 6869, youmight remind M. Stettinius that this question of voting is not the only one thatremains to be settled before a United Nations Conference could be called, and thatall the difficulties will not probably have been got out of the way before the next three-Power meeting, and therefore he should not go ahead too precipitately.Moreover, he will remember that the idea was that the invitation to theConference should be sent out in the name of the Three (or Four) Powers.Consequently we should have to consult together before the invitation actuallyissues.
