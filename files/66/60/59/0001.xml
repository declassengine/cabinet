THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cabinet.   January 1945.-lao^uj! &amp; HiUii .1.1 i wos -aldaliisvjB ad bluSECRET.Copy No./W.P. (45) 42.19th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.REBUILDING OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.Note by the Minister of Works.THE report of the Select Committee on the Rebuilding of the House ofCommons is to be debated next Thursday, the 25th January.2. There is little doubt that the Select Committee&apos;s proposals will receivegeneral acceptance. However, during the course of the Debate a number of constructive suggestions involving minor modifications are likely to be made. Inorder to deal with these, I propose that the Select Committee should be recon-stituted with the same membership and with the following restricted terms ofreference:- &apos;   &apos;&quot; &apos;.&quot; &quot; To examine the. proposals of the b Committee on the House ofCommons (Rebuilding) in the light of suggestions made since the publicationof its Report and to recommend to the House any amendments of detailwhich may appear desirable.&apos;&apos;The Select Committee should be able to complete this limited task and report backto the House within a month to six weeks.3. Thereafter, the Minister of Works, who will be responsible. for carryingout the plans, will, I assume, be free to approve any minor changes which may befound necessary during the course of the building. Should any major departure from the original scheme prove necessary, the House would, of course, have to be4. The Report includes proposals for the provision, on three floors belowand above the Chamber, of accommodation for the Officers of the House, Ministers&apos;rooms, and secretarial facilities for Members of Parliament. Since the accom-modation throughout the whole Palace of Westminster is now under review bya Joint Committee of both Houses, I suggest that, provided comparable andequally convenient facilities can be provided elsewhere, the Joint Committeeshould, within the structural limitations of the architecfs plan, not be debarred from recommending alternative uses for the space available on these three floors.5. Before we can place a lump sum contract for the work, detailed drawingswill have to be made. This will take about eighteen months. If, on the otherhand, we were to go to tender on the basis of a schedule of prices, this preparatoryperiod could be considerably reduced.6. The actual rebuilding will take a further 3 to 4^-years, according as towhether double shifts are worked. In practice, however, our time-table will be largely determined by other wider considerations such as the duration of theEuropean war, the progress of bomb damage repairs and the labour requirements for other urgent priority work.7.   I suggest the following tentative programme : (i) Assuming that the House approves the plan in principle on the25th January, the architect should be instructed forthwith to proceedwith the preparation of drawings.(ii) As soon as second stage repairs of bomb damage in London are com-pleted, or nearly completed, the work of demolition should be started.This will take about six months.uoiib ulted.[29074]
(iii) If the demolitions are finished before the detailed drawings are ready,we should go ahead with the preparation of foundations on the basisof a schedule of prices.(iv) By the time the foundations are completed, which will take a further three months, all the more essential drawings should be available, sothat a lump sum contract for the superstructure could be placed.Thereafter, the main work of rebuilding would proceed. The decision as to whether or not double shifts should be worked would have to betaken in the light of prevailing conditions.Thus, assuming that the bombardment of London does not continue for morethan a few months longer, and that the second stage repairs are substantiallycompleted by the end of June, the rebuilding of the Chamber could, if doubleshifts are worked, be finished some time during the first half of 1949.8. The average labour force needed during each year after the starting ofwork would be as follows :  (a) (b)With Withoutdouble doubleshift. shift.*First year       .........            100 100Second year    .........             450 300Third year      .........             300 250Fourth year     .........             120 200Fifth year..........             ... 130* The first year would be occupied with demolition and the preparing of foundations.9. The annual expenditure for these two alternative programmes would be approximately as follows : (a) (b)  .         Before start of work   .*.......20,000 20,000First year       .........         70,000 70,000Second year     .........       500,000 330,000Third year     ......      ...       370,000 300,000Fourth year     ...       ......       240,000 260,000Fifth year      .........         80,000 190,000Sixth year       .........           ... 80,000t l,280,000  1,250,000f Includes  30,000 for cost of double shift10. The Select Committee felt that the allocation of Strangers&apos; seats layoutside their terms of reference and recommended that a Committee, possiblypresided over by Mr. Speaker, should undertake this responsibility The Govern-ment should, I think, indicate its acceptance of this proposal. It will not benecessary for the Committee actually to be set up until the new Chamber is built.D. S.Ministry of Works, S.E. 1,19th January, 1945.
