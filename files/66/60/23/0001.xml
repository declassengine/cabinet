THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 6.3rd January, 1945.COMMONWEALTH CONVERSATIONS IN LONDON.Memorandum by the Minister for Civil Aviation.IN my Paper W.P. (44) 752 I reported on the Commonwealth conversations at Montreal. These were followed by further conversations in London beforeand after Christmas, during which we made good progress. During the Londonconversations, Australia was represented by Mr. Drakeford and the HighCommissioner, New Zealand by Mr. Sullivan and his staff, South Africa byMr. Martin and India by Sir Gurunath Bewoor and Sir Frederick Tymms, all of whom had led their delegations at Chicago and Montreal. Canada was.represented by a senior officer from the High Commissioner, Southern Rhodesiaby Air Vice-Marshal Meridith. Representatives of the Dominions Office, ColonialOffice, India Office and Air Ministry, and the Chairman of B.O.A.C. took partin the discussions.   The following subjects were covered : 2. The Commonwealth Air Transport Council.(a) New Zealand, South Africa and India signified their formal acceptanceof the functions of the Council, as set out in Appendix A toW.P. (44) 752. The Canadian and Australian Governments have notyet signified their acceptance of the actual terms.(b) All the Dominions and India nominated officers from their high commissioners&apos; Offices to be liaison officers with the Civil AviationDepartment as Secretariat of the Council.(c) The Minister of Aircraft Production had proposed that C.E.R.C.A.,the Commonwealth organisation dealing with the application ofRadar to Civil Aviation, should be brought under the aegis of theCommonwealth Air Council, and that the Secretariat of the council should undertake all secretariat work connected with C.E.R.C.A.This proposal was approved. Sir Robert Watson Watt gave theconference an account of the recent meeting of C.E.R.C.A. in Torontoand an outline of future work.3. Interim Council of the International Organisation.We had a good deal of discussion oh the organisation and representationof the Commonwealth on the Interim Council which is to be set up, with head-quarters in Canada, under the Chicago Interim Agreement. The UnitedKingdom, Canada, Australia and India are members of the Interim Council. Agreat deal of work will have to be done by the Interim Council and its Committeesbetween March and September of this year on the technical annexes to theConvention covering the whole field of Air Navigation. While the InterimCouncil will have to have an adequate permanent staff, we agreed that the workon the annexes would be most effectively done if Commonwealth countries sentover the best experts they could provide, when their particular subjects came up for consideration. This led us to discuss how we could best provide the experts, without impossible depletion of our small and overworked technical staffs.I therefore made the suggestion that we should parcel out the work between us,and that men drawn from different parts of the Commonwealth should representus all in their particular subjects. This was warmly welcomed, and I think itwill be a valuable form of Commonwealth co-operation. The arrangements willbe co-ordinated by the Secretariat of the Commonwealth Air Council.4. Standard Clauses.We went over these fully again; some modifications were made which arean improvement in clarification, but they do not alter the principles.   As mycolleagues know, Canada takes its own line over this; but Canada&apos;s independent[28959]Copy no war CABINET.
action does not compromise the Empire routes. The other Dominions and india are wholeheatedly in favour of the Clauses. I attach in an Annex the final draft of thev Clauses, as agreed.5. Empire Routes.We finalised, as far as is possible at the present stage, the arrangements forthe Commonwealth air routes : (a) United Kingdom-India-Australia-New Zealand.This service will have to remain sectionalised until there are enough&quot; Lancastrian &quot; aircraft to run through services in parallel. As soon as these aircraft are available in adequate numbers, the service will befiperated in parallel, B.O.A.C. and the Australian Company running right through along thewhole route.It was agreed that the operators should proceed with planning and working-out a programme on a provisional basis which would, inter alia, co-ordinate the through services and the local services operated by Tasman Empire Airways, andthat concrete proposals should be submitted to Governments as soon as possible.It was also agreed that the Postal Authorities of the various commonwealth countries concerned should be asked to work out the probable volume of postaltraffic for carriage by air on the route, the estimate to be framed on an alternativebasis according to the policy, i.e., &quot;all-up&quot; or &quot;surcharge,&quot; whichever was eventually adopted.(b) United Kingdom-India.We had a good deal of discussion with the Indian representatives as to how the services to India, which did not go through to Australia, should be operateduntil India was ready to take on her share by parallel operation or possibly in ajoint company. Estimates were presented of the capital cost and annualoperational cost of the service.Ministers directly concerned have a full record of the discussion. I will only-say here that I am sure we must do everything possible to help India with technical and operational advice and personnel, and in the training of air crews.(c) Pacific.   Australia-New Zealand-United States-Canada.The full discussion on the outstanding matters with regard to this route is recorded in the minutes.(i) We agreed how- negotiations with the United States should be handledwThen the United States Government approached the Australian andNew Zealand Governments. These negotiations will be handled by theDominion Governments in close consultation with the United KingdomGovernment.(ii) It was agreed that the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand Post Officesshould be asked to prepare an estimate of the probable volume of postaltraffic and the probable postal revenue on the Trans-Pacific route, andthat the operators should review their estimate as soon as the postalfigures were available.(d) United Kingdom-South Africa, via, Cairo, East Africa, Rhodesia.This route will be operated by B.O.A.C. and the South African Governmentin parallel. All questions of principle were settled, including types of aircraft,responsibility for servicing, division of frequencies, pooling of revenue andapportionment of expenditure.It was agreed that the operators should immediately work out together alldetails in accordance with these principles. It is hoped to start this service atthe end of March.6. Chartering of Aircraft during the Interim Period.Several Governments raised this question as regards aircraft both for the trunk routes and for feeder services. I am sure we must be ready to charter or lease planes both for Commonwealth and foreign customers. We must deal with both interim machines, converted types, e.g., Yorks, Tudors, Wellingtons andwith surplus adapted RAF. machines, e.g., Dominies and Ansons. The Ministerof Aircraft Production has been a strong advocate of this policy; and I think the Treasury and the Air Ministry are in full agreement with the principle. Weare at work on how to carrv it out.
7. Types of Aircraft.We circulated to the Conference a very full memorandum on the interim types of aircraft and the *&quot; Brabazon &quot; types. Lord Brabazon gave the Conferencean excellent account of the work of his Committee, the types they had put in handand the reasons which had led them to adopt these types. This was greatlyappreciated.8. United States Negotiations with South Africa.Mr. Martin gave a full account of the approach made to him by the UnitedStates Government before he left America, The United States want to run an experimental service once a week via West Africa to the Union. It is rather a&apos;long-range venture and the United States suggested it might not start for a year,though I should certainly not bank on this. The experimental service, whichwould be terminable at short notice, would be followed, if successful, by a regularbilateral agreement. Mr. Martin said that, if we had no objection, he wouldadvise his Government to agree to this proposal; but he had made it clear to theUnited States that the Union Government were in full agreement with the BritishPlan, and that in any agreement they would insist on Standard Clauses to giveeffect to the British proposals. South Africa would also wish to claim reciprocity,not only for herself but for her United Kingdom partner, if either wished to runa reciprocal service.Mr. Martin said that he would further advise his Government in making eventhe short-term experimental agreement to notify the United States Governmentthat any future agreement would contain these provisions. He proposed also to insist on approving the fares charged, as these might have repercussions on other-routes.I think my colleagues will agree that this is a good first fruit of Chicago andMontreal Commonwealth co-operation.9. South African Conference.Mr. Martin said that Field-Marshal Smuts was anxious to convene thepostponed South African Conference on Civil Aviation as soon as possible. TheUnion Prime Minister very much hoped that I would attend this conferencemyself, and I said I would certainly do my best to do so. It is proposed that thefollowing should be invited to attend the conference : Representatives of theDominions Office and Colonial Office, the East African Governors&apos; Conference,Southern Rhodesia, a representative of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, andthe High Commissioner. Mr. Martin has telegraphed to Field-Marshal Smutssuggesting the beginning of March as a convenient date.It had been proposed to have a meeting of the Commonwealth Air Councilin March. This date was fixed because it was expected that all commonwealth governments would be in London in March for the Imperial CommunicationsConference. As this conference has now been postponed, it was decided to postpone the meeting of the Commonwealth Air Council until the end of May.This will be convenient to all Commonwealth countries. In the Montreal and london meetings we have covered so much ground that a March meeting is nolonger necessary; it will enable the South African Conference to be held inMarch; and the Canadian Government will be very much occupied in March and april getting the Interim Council going.S.A riel House, Strand, W.C. 2,3rd January, 1945.ANNEX.Standard Clauses.It is suggested that any bilateral agreements entered into by commonwealth countries should contain clauses in conformity with the following conditions :- (1) The capacity to be operated between the territories of the contracting Basicparties shall be determined from time to time, on the basis of an agreed load factor, CaPacit*-!n relation to the traffic embarked in the territory of each for the territory ofthe other ;(*)&apos;r) No definite load factor has been mentioned because of the varying determining condi-&apos;ons on different routes. The appropriate load factor is one which maintains broad equilibriumefcween capacity and traffic operating on the route in question.
Division of capacity.Capacity forOnwardDestinations.TrafficOriginatingin other states.(2) The capacity determined as aforesaid shall normally be regarded asequally divisible between the two parties, (2) but the proportion operated by each party may be varied by agreement between them, so, however, that the totalcapacity determined in accordance with Clause (1) is not exceeded ;(3)(3) Capacity on the services of one contracting party proceeding beyondthe territory of the other contracting party will be assessed in relation to the capacity necessary to convey traffic embarked in the territory of the former foronward destinations on the route. The capacity so assessed may be operatedbetween the territories of the two contracting parties in addition to the capacitydetermined under clause (1);(4) Where a claim is made for the conveyance of traffic additional to the traffic embarked in the State of origin of the aircraft either,(i) Because such additional traffic is necessary to enable the through airline on whose behalf the claim is made, to operate with economy itsauthorised capacity under clauses (1) and (3); or(ii) Because additional capacity on the through services operating along the route is necessary to meet requirements for air transportationwhich are not otherwise provided for,the following procedure shall be followed : The contracting parties will enter into consultation with the other states concerned in order to determine what adjustments of capacity, if any, shouldbe made at the appropriate stages on the route. Such adjustments shall be governed by : (a) The capacity determined in accordance with clauses (1) and (3).(b) The air transport needs of the State through which the route passes,judged in relation to public convenience and necessity.(c) The adequacy of regional and local air transport development.(d) The economy of through air-line operations.Tariffs.Arbitration.If the States are unable to reach agreement, the contracting parties, asbetween themselves, agree to refer the matter to arbitration as hereinafter provided.(5) Tariffs will be fixed at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant factors including economical operation, reasonable profit, differentialsin rates in relation to differences of characteristics of service, including standards of speed and accommodation, and tariffs charged by any other operatorson the route. Tariffs charged for traffic taken up on a route, otherthan traffic embarked in or designed for the State of origin of the aircraft,shall be higher than the corresponding tariffs charged for similar traffic carried by local or regional services on the corresponding sector of the route. Tariffswill be settled, in the first instance, between the airlines operating the service under this Agreement and other airlines operating on the route or any sectionthereof. Any tariffs so agreed will be subject to the approval of the contractingparties. In the event of disagreement between the airlines, the contracting partiesthemselves shall endeavour to reach agreement. Should the contracting partiesfail to agree, the matter in dispute will be referred to arbitration as hereinafter provided.(6) Any matter in dispute under this Agreement, whether of interpretationor of application, shall be referred for decision, either to the Interim Council inaccordance with the provisions of Article of the Interim Agreement, or toan Arbitral Tribunal appointed by agreement between the parties, whicheverprocedure the parties shall agree to adopt. The parties undertake as between themselves to be bound by the decision of the Arbitration on which they haveagreed. (4)(2) Equal division of capacity between the two parties concerned on any route will be found,in practice, to be broadly equivalent to division on the traffic embarked principle. In any case,however, where it may be agreed between the two parties that the equal division of capacitywould not result in an equitable application of this principle, it will be open to the parties tomake adjustment accordingly as may be mutually agreed.(3) This part of the Clause is intended to cover the case where one party is not ready at anyparticular time to operate its quota in part or in full. In such a case it will be open to the two parties to agree that one should operate the capacity of the other, in part or in full, for such period of time as may be arranged.(4) It will be for the parties to the agreement to decide to which arbitral authority they will submit matters in dispute.
