THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,  January 1945.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited, it is issued for the personal use of...........Mediterranean^^V^^^..................:..........TOP SECRET. Copy Wo.W.P. (45) 22.12th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.SHORT LEAVE FOR THE R.A.F. OVERSEAS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State eor Air.1. I ask the War Cabinet to agree to the extension to R.A.F. personnel in South-East Asia, the Middle East and the Central Mediterranean of the short-leave scheme recently approved for the Army and Indian Army (W.P. (44) 644and War Cabinet Conclusions of the 15th November, 1944). It is true that theArmy scheme derives from the difficulty of reducing the Army overseas tour to correspond with the Naval tour (2/3 years) and the R.A.F. tour (3 years for married and 4 years for single personnel), but in South-East Asia the Armyand R.A.F. are working to similar tours and, with the two Services workingside by side, an arrangement under which Army personnel. receive a period ofhome leave while R.A.F. personnel do not is impossible to defend and is likelyto lead to serious discontent in the Royal Air Force.2. The R.A.F. scheme-would apply only to M.A.A.F. and A.C.S.E.A. and,like the Army scheme, would allow a period of home leave of approximatelytwenty-eight days, excluding time spent in travel. The scheme would be subjectto review on the conclusion of hostilities in Europe. The monthly quotas ofmen of all ranks to be sent on leave, calculated on a basis comparable to that adopted by the Army, would average 900 from M.A.A.F. (including Middle East,East Africa, Persia and Iraq, the Central Mediterranean and North Africa) and700 from A.C.S.E.A. (including India).3. I propose that there should be close liaison locally between the Armyand Air Force Commanders in the operation of the scheme, and that decisions as to the numbers of R.A.F. personnel who oan be sent on leave within the quotaallotted, having regard to operational requirements, and the methods of selectionshould be left to the discretion of Air Officers Commanding-in-Chief subject toalignment with local Army practice wherever possible.4. The new 20-days cycle for convoys means that only two-thirds of eachmonthly quota will have to sail in each convoy i.e., 600 from the Mediterraneanarea and 460 from the Far East. No real shipping difficulties should arise,particularly when in two or three months&apos; time transit by train across Francefrom Marseilles is introduced.5. Mr. Turton has put down a Question for answer on Wednesday next, the17th January, asking whether R.A.F. personnel in A.C.S.E.A. can come home ona system of short leave similar to that enjoyed by Army personnel. I feel that i must be in a position to make a positive statement in reply.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, 12th January, 1945.[29020]
