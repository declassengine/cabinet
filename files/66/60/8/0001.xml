On the 20th US. L.S.T. 359 was sunk and the U.S.S. Fogg (destroyer)was torpedqecl by a U-boat in a westbound convoy N.E. of the Azores. Fogg hasbeen taken &quot;in tow.Mediterranean.Western Mediterranean.6. On the night of the.15th/16th coastal craft torpedoed 2 F-lighters N.W.of Spezia and on the following night attacked a convoy in the same area;2 lignters and an R-boat blew up, one lighter capsized and a coaster was damaged.Three of II.M. trawlers were slightly damaged.On two occasions during the week the U.S. destroyer Niblack shelled enemybarracks on the Franco-Italian frontier.Up to the 15th the total amount of cargo discharged through Toulon, Portde Bouc and Marseilles was 1,513,167 tons. Unloading through Marseillesaveraged 16,000 tons daily during the week ending the 19th.A driatic.7.

Thefollowing night the island of 1st, N.W. of Zara, was attacked by 4 explosivemotor boats; one blew up and the remainder were driven off.Greece. .. , ;8. Naval gunfire is reported to have produced a marked effect upon thecourse of operations in Greece. This was especially the case at Piraeus whenthe Naval Wireless Station was menaced by E.L.A.S. troops on the 15th anda destroyer provided close support under cover of which .10 tanks were landedfrom an L.S.T. On the same day Allied warships bombarded Lofos Castellowhich was later captured; this strongpoint overlooks, the Southern Peninsulaat the Piraeus and Phaleron Bay, and its capture considerably improved the amenities of the anchorage in that Bay from the Allied point of view. TheSouthern Peninsula was later reported to be completely clear of E.L.A.S. troops and sealed off, and on the 20th the harbour was being used for unloading. Theroad to Athens is reopened.It is reported that Greek Naval Reservists are being enrolled for guard duty.
On the 15th and the following night H.M. Ships Beaufort (destroyer) andRinaldo (minesweeper) covered the withdrawal Of Indian troops from Krioneronear Missolonghi where they had been attacked by E.L.A.S. troops on the 14th.Kalamata in Messenia was evacuated without incident on the 16th and h.M. destroyer Meteor, at the request of the local E.A.M. committee has landedliberty men as a proof of mutual confidence. The evacuation of Kavalla hasalso been completed. On the 17th British troops and vehicles at Volo wereembarked in H.M. destroyer Musketeer, and by the 19th small outlying detach-ments had been called in so that on the mainland the British concentrations,apart from that in Attica, were only at Salonika and Patras.In Crete the local E.L.A.S. are reported to be behaving very well and fullyco-operating with the British authorities. The distribution of relief storescontinues and is creating a good impression. The work of clearing Heraclionharbour is reported to be progressing satisfactorily.H.M.S. Sirius (cruiser) has arrived at Mitylene where a general strike is inprogress. -On the 15th tfie Greek naval depot ship Ionia ran aground on Repi Island,near Skiathos and is probably a total loss. In the Dodecanese H.M. destroyerMarne intercepted an assault craft and a caique near Symi on the 17th and took22 German and 5 Italian, prisoners.East Indies.9. H.M. submarines have reported as follows : Stygian, during a recentpatrol in the Malacca Strait, sank 2 coasters and a landing craft by gunfire andprobably torpedoed 2 coasters. Supreme sank 6 junks by gunfire and Porpoisesank a large junk in the Malacca Strait.Pacific.10. It is reported that carrier-borne aircraft, -supporting the Mindoroinvason, have sunk or damaged 94 enemy vessels and destroyed 265 aircraft inthe Luzon area. The ships sunk included one large transport, 3 tankers and10 cargo ships; 4 destroyers, 2 destroyer escorts and 10 cargo ships were among those damaged.Two cargo ships were bombed and damaged by aircraft in the Philippinearea.On the 7th H.M. S/M Sea Rover sank a coastal craft in the Macassar Strait.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. Ten attacks by warships were reported during the week but none ofthese were considered to be promising. In addition preliminary reports from air and surface escorts of a convoy from North Russia indicate that 4 promisingand several other attacks were carried out.On the 18th a U-boat foundered on Wolf Rock (off Lands End) and 36 ofthe crew were taken prisoner. It is reported that on the 10th November theU.S. S/M Flounder sank a German U-boat in the Java Sea.Enemy Intelligence.12. The Scheer was located at Gdynia on the 15th with the remainder ofthe German Baltic Fleet reported last week.The disposition of operational minor German warships is as follows : R-boats 30-40 in the Baltic, 25-35 in Norway and 45-55 in the Bight and holland.Minesweepers-50-60 in the Baltic, 25-35 in Norway, 20-30 in the Bight and holland and 10 in the Channel Islands and Biscay ports.Trawlers-200-250 in the Baltic, 200-250 in Norway, 140-150 in the Bightand Holland and 40-50 in the Channel Islands and Biscay ports.Sperrbrechers-About 10 in the Baltic and about 20 in the Bight and holland. -Landing craft-About 100 in the Baltic, about 30 in Norway, about 70 inthe Bight and Holland and 45 in the Channel Islands and Biscay ports.There is evidence that the number of enemy small battle units in N.W. europe is considerable and increasing.[28878] B
U-boats13. Considerable activity continues off the Norwegian coast; inshore patrolsare being maintained off the western and northern coasts of the United Kingdom,and it is estimated that 4 or 5 U-boats are at present operating in the english channel.A U-boat which has been operating N.E. of the Azores may be on its way tothe Strait of Gibraltar.On the 15th, 53 U-boats (operational or fitting out) were seen at Dantzig.Enemy Attack on Shipping.14. One ship in coastal convoy was sunk by a U-boat off the south Cornishcoast. Three ships, including the R.F.A. War Diwan (5,561 tons), were mined and sunk off Flushing.  One ship was damaged by mine off Havre.Allied Minelaying.15. Mines have been laid by surface craft in Home Waters and by aircraft in the Kattegat, Baltic and Oslofiord. One of H.M. submarines has laid mines in the Malacca Strait, and aircraft have laid mines off the Burmese coast.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.16. Minelaying by E-boats is suspected on the convoy route to the Scheldtand aircraft probably laid mines off Flushing.The mine totals are 6.215 ground and 7,558 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.17. There are now 10 tankers of .47,000 tons and 83 cargo ships of about349,000 tons under construction in Norway, Denmark, Holland and Germany.About 70 small vessels, including 3 floating docks, are also building andfitting out.Six ships totalling 37,000 tons have been sunk as blockships in Dutch waters.A tanker and 7 cargo ships totalling some 60,000 tons have fallen into Alliedhands at Antwerp.Ships sufficiently advanced in construction are being towed from Dutch to german yards, and ships launched in Germany are being towed to Denmark forfitting out.MILITARY SITUATIONWestern Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.19. Little further progress has been made in the south where enemy resistance-tance has stiffened. In the Saar area we have consolidated our positions andhave crossed the German frontier north of Flaguenau.A strong German counter-attack which &quot;was launched on the 16th betweenEchternach and Malmedy has broken the line north and south of St. Vith andhas penetrated some 35 miles to the west.Southern Group of Armies.20. There has been little further progress towards the clearance of the enemyRhine-Vosges pocket. The enemy has counter-attacked our positions north ofMulhouse, east of Thann, and north of Colmar, but has made no solid gains.On the 18th the First French Army made limited advances NW. of Munster,north of Colmar and along the west bank of the Rhine.The Seventh US. Army has continued its advance north of Haguenau andReichshofen. It has cleared the west bank of the Rhine from Trasbourg to theGerman frontier N.E. of Haguenau, and by the 18th had crossed the frontieralong a 20-mile front. Enemy resistance has stiffened, considerably as the U.S.forces have made contact with their positions in the outer defences of the Siegfriedline. Further west, U.S. troops are still held up in front of Bitsche, but have reduced several of the Maginot line fortifications about the town.
Central Group of Armies.21. The Third .U.S. Army has consolidated its positions beyond Sarre-guemines and has crossed the German frontier on a 10 miles front. Enemycounter-attacks against the two bridgeheads at and north of Saarlautern havebeen.repulsed, but the U.S. troops here have been able to make little progress.-During the first part of the week, the First U.S. Army pressed forward toreach the Roer on a wide front, and now holds most of the west bank of the riverfrom Julich to a point 5 miles south of Duren. On the 16th the enemy launcheda strong counter-offensive against the First U.S. Army, which was preceded by parachute landings in a number of places. Three distinct thrusts were made.One west of Treves achieved some progress beyond Echternach, a second reachedthe vicinity of Bastogne, while the third, and most powerful, was directed towardsSt. Vith and Malmedy and to the west of these towns. As a result of these attacksthe U.S. line was broken on a wide front between Echternach and Malmedyisolating certain forces in the St. Vith area. German spearheads have penetratedbeyond Bastogne, and to Marche, Habiemont and Stavelot.The U.S. forces, fighting to contain the flanks of this penetration, hold a line in the south from Echternach N.W. to Bastogne and in the north from Malmedy,west and S.W. through Stavelot, Habiermont, Hotton and Marche. A gap exists between March and Bastogne. Elements of the forces holding out in the St. Vitharea are slowing up the German rate of reinforcement by denying them the main road centres. - ...Further north, in the area of Monschau, U.S. formations have been forced togive some ground, but the enemy has not succeeded in breaking through this sector.Northern Group of Armies.22. Activity in this sector has been confined to patrolling. There has been no appreciable increase in the extent of the flooding north of Nijmegen.   .Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset,)23. During the period Canadian forces, operating in the area of Bagnaca-vallo, have been unable to make much progress. The enemy has defended the numerous waterways with the utmost tenacity. Hard fighting has gone on, andmany prisoners of war have been taken.To the S.W. of Faenza, New Zealand and Indian troops reassumed the offensive on the night of the 14th/15th. On the right flank of this attack,resistance was stubborn but slightly easier towards the left flank. Good progress was made during the succeeding days and on the 17th Faenza was cleared andthe area south of Highway 9 and east of the River Senio was in our hands.New Zealand troops then tried to push north from Highway 9, between Faenzaand the Senio river, but the enemy held the line of the railway most determinedly.On the 20th New Zealand forces were able to make good progress north of the highway, and reached the Senio river against little opposition.Polish troops, operating N.W. of Brisighella, have advanced towards theRiver Senio against scattered resistance.Elsewhere on the front activity has been very limited, except astride theImola-Firenzuola road, when some fierce fighting has taken place for the village of Tossignano, which has changed hands three times and is now held by theenemy.The Eastern European Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Southern Sector.24. The only fighting of any importance took place in Czechoslovakia andNorthern Hungary. In the area north of Miskolc the Russians pressed theGermans back and are now across the old Czechoslovak frontier along a,stretchof some 70 miles. The Germans reacted by counter-attacking N.E. of Miskolc,where they claim to have regained a little ground against stiff russian resistance. The Germans are still clinging to the area east of Kisterenye, and up to now the Russians have not widened their narrow salient north of Budapest,although some attempts to develop it towards the east have been reported. until this has been done, the Russians will have difficulty in fully exploiting thesuccessful thrust which they made there earlier this month,[28878] .. b2
Jugoslavia.25. The German withdrawal is continuing gradually, harassed byMarshal Tito&apos;s troops and Allied air attacks. Some 2 divisions which have beencontained in Southern Montenegro have now forced their way N.E. and havelinked up with stronger forces east of Sarajevo. rGreece.26. Fighting in Athens/Piraeus has continued throughout the week and our immediate military intention of securing a firm line of communication fromthe Piraeus to the centre of the capital has been achieved.In the centre of the city British troops have extended and consolidated theirhold, with the capture of the eastern peak of Likavittos, the Stadium and theAcropolis. Strong E.L.A.S. attacks forced our troops to evacuate the Averofprison on the 19th, but many of the political prisoners incarcerated there weregot out at the same time. A fully co-ordinated insurgent assault upon UnionSquare a few days previously was withstood.Considerable activity throughout the week by Imperial troops in the Piraeushas resulted in the clearing of the Kallipolis peninsula south of the railway and a linking up with the centre of the city through Phaleron : strong resistancewas encountered in the Kallithea brewery, but our forces have, now driven this in. Cargo is once more being unloaded in Piraeus harbour instead of at PbaleronBay. :   &quot;In the area N.E. of the city Royal Air Force Rear Headquarters at Kifissiafell to strong rebel forces on the 19th.Burma.27.. On the Arakan coast our troops have advanced about 9 miles without opposition &quot;during the past week, and leading elements are now in the village ofKyuakpandu. Other troops reoccupied Buthidaung on the 15th, and reachedthe outskirts of Kindaung on the 19th.On the Chindwin East African troops entered Shwegyin, 7 miles south ofKalewa, on the 14th. They are now advancing along the Kalewa-Pyingaing road.Leading elements are 23 miles from Pyingaing. Troops from the Mawlaikbridgehead have driven southwards towards Pyingaing. On the 20th they had established themselves some 4 miles north of the village.Further north three eastward thrusts have developed. The southern oneresulted in the capture of Indaw (Oil) on the 15th; the Central thrust, which reached Pinlebu on the 16th, penetrated to Wuntho on the 19th; the northernthrust resulted in the link-up of troops from the Sittaung-Paungbyin bridge-head with those of the 36th British Division in the Indaw (Rail) area. Leadingelements have occupied the village of Namhkam in the Myitkyina-Maridalayrailway corridor, where they have encountered slight opposition.China,28. The Japanese withdrawal down the Liuchow-Tuyun railway hascontinued, and the Chinese were last reported one mile west of Hochih. N.W. ofNaning the Japanese have also withdrawn to the neighbourhood of Wuming.Philippines.Leyte.29. In the Southern Sector, the 77th U.S. Inf. Div. has advancednorthwards from Ormoc in face of stubborn enemy resistance, and captured thetown and airfield of Valencia. Forward elements of this division are now4 miles north of this town.In the Northern Sector, the main U.S. forces are encountering strong opposition in the area 4 miles south of Limon, but on their right flank the1st U.S. Cav. Div. has pushed forward and reached a point on the Limon-Ormocroad within a mile of the 77th U.S. Inf. Div.The latest official figures of Japanese casualties now amount to 35,356 killed and 261 prisoners of war.
Mindoro.30. On the 15th tLS. troops landed on the S.W. coast of Mindoro Island.This landing was unopposed; they captured the town of San Jose, and forwardelements reached positions up to 8 miles inland. Preliminary reports indicate thatairfield potentialities in this area are excellent.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.. 31. Fighter Command flew 50 defensive sorties against flying bombs (seeparagraph 45).Home Waters.32. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 727 sorties; twoMosquitoes and one Catalina are missing.Little enemy shipping was sighted; the only attacks reported were those ona 4,000-ton ship aground in Sogne Fiord, which was left well on fire, on a6,000-ton vessel off the Skaw, and on a stationary vessel 48 miles north ofTrondheim.Bomber Command aircraft laid 402 sea mines.Western Europe.33.

Two hundred and four enemy aircraft were destroyed and 127 damaged ; 120 Allied aircraft are missing.The German counter-offensive between Duren and Treves (paragraph 21)resulted in a considerable increase in activity on the part of the G.A.F. Early inthe morning of the 17th some 90 enemy aircraft dropped paratroops behind the positions of the First and Ninth U.S. Armies; A.A. claim to have destroyed orprobably destroyed 34 of these aircraft. These air landing operations appear tohave been accompanied by considerable activity on the part of. Ju. 87 attackingcommunication centres. Black Widows in night operations over this sector ofthe front destroyed 5 out of 9 enemy aircraft encountered, and over 30 M.T.During the day the single-engined fighter force of the G.A.F. operated in greaterstrength than at any time since the Allied landing in Normandy; over 500 sorties were flown over the northern and central battle areas as compared with 1,400 by allied fighter bombers and fighters; 107 enemy aircraft were destroyed and over60 damaged.
