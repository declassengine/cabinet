THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST/fS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECEET. Copy No...W.P. (45) 37.iSt/i January, 1945.WAR CABINET.INDIA: Mr. DESAI&apos;S APPROACH TO THE VICEROY.Report by the Lord President of the Council, Chairman of the india committee.THE Committee have considered the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of the 14th January,1945 (No..l09-S : Annex II), to the Secretary of State for India reporting certainapproaches made to the Private Secretary to&quot; the Viceroy by Mr. Bhulabhai Desai.2. The genesis of these proposals is far from clear. They may derive fromthe Viceroy&apos;s conversation with Mr. Jinnah, reported in his telegram of the7th December, No. 2236-S. Or they may be merely a response to the many invita-tions to the Indian political parties to put forward a solution of their own.3.   We invite attention to the following points : &apos;(a) In thefirst place, the scheme proposes to implement one. part only of the Crippsoffer, which was dependent on the acceptance of arrangements for afinal solution of the general Indian constitutional problem. Althoughadmittedly the proposal is one to work under the existing Constitution,it must be recognised that a position might soon develop in which theconstitutional position was altered. This possibility is reflected in the uncertainty of the terms of paragraph 3 (&amp;) of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram.It is not clear whether the intention is that the Viceroy should accepta list of Ministers from the political parties as if he were the Governor-General of a Dominion, or is merely to receive names from which hewould make his own selection. The distinction is vital. If the formerinterpretation is correct, we should be embarking on a course whichelsewhere in the Empire has led to full responsible government on the westminster model.(b) It is by no means clear to what extent Mr. Desai is in fact in a position to speak with any authority on behalf of either Mr. Gandhi or mr. Jinnah. Nor is it clear how far Mr. Gandhi&apos;s assent oracquiescence carries with it the support of Congress. The suggestion(paragraph 3 (5) of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram) that the, detenus shouldnot be released until the new Government had been formed, would leave it open to them to start a campaign for further concessions if nounderstanding on this point was reached.(d) There is no guarantee as yet that if these proposals were accepted,Congress wrould be prepared to lend full support to the war effort.(e) Nor is there any suggestion that as a part of the settlement as proposedGandhi&apos;s Quit India Resolution would be withdrawn.(/) The statement in paragraph 2 (e) of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram thatMr. Jinnah would agree to a Government of  the kind  proposed&quot;without prejudice to Pakistan&quot; needs elucidation.(g) Equally, we should be clear how the 20 per cent, minority representation in the Council would be selected and composed. Would it cover non-Congress Hindus and non-Muslim League Muslims?(h) Would Indian officials be eligible for appointment to the new Council?4.   This is a very important matter.  We are entitled to be clear as to whatthese proposals mean before we are asked to accept them.   We think, therefore,that further exploration is called for.   But we feel that it should not be by the[29056]
Viceroy himself but preferably by his Private Secretary, to whom the originalapproach was made. It should, moreover, be entirely non-committal and confined to establishing the facts. It should cover the points we have mentioned aboveAvith any supplementary points which the Viceroy wishes to add. The position should be reconsidered when his reply is received.5. At our request the Secretary of State for India has asked the viceroy to postpone any meeting with Mr. Desai until he hears further from the Cabinet.We attach, for the&quot;Cabinet&apos;s consideration, a telegram to Lord Wavell (Annex I).But we feel that the turn which this matter has taken is an additional argument for the proposed discussions between the War Cabinet and the Viceroy being-held if possible earlier than at present contemplated. For the risk, as we see it, of misunderstanding and of the situation taking an unfortunate turn, unless he is more fully seized of the mind of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of our general policy, is very great.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,18th January, 1945.ANNEX I.Draft Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy.War Cabinet have now considered your telegram of the 14th January,No. 109-S.2. They agree that this approach needs very careful handling. They agreewith-you also that it is in certain respects unsatisfactory and obscure. Schemeinvolves conceding Interim Government which in Cripps offer was conditional onpermanent constitutional settlement without any commitment as regards long-term problem. Acceptance of it or even indication of readiness to consider itwould thus deeply commit future.   Accordingly, it needs most careful testing.3. Main points on which War Cabinet desire fuller information to enablethem to consider further are as follows : (a) We cannot reconcile paragraph 3 (b) and paragraph 3 (d). If intention is that Governor-General would accept a list submitted to him by political parties and would have no freedom of choice, as if he werethe Governor-General of a Dominion, that would be wholly incon-sistent with present constitutional position. Distinction is, of course,vital. If this were the intention, we feel that the personal authoritybehind the Governor-General&apos;s reserve powers would be very muchweakened at the outset, and that we should in effect be committed tothe principle of a Parliamentary Executive at the Centre.(&amp;) We are not satisfied to what extent Desai is in a position to commit eitherGandhi or Jinnah, or how far Gandhi&apos;s assent or acquiescence carrieswith it, the support of Congress. The proposal that detenus should be released only after the new Government is in office would, failingbinding assurances in respect of Congress, leave it open to them to start agitation for further concessions and provoke a break. If thescheme is to work, in the Centre or in the Provinces, full and officialCongress Party acceptance and support would have to be guaranteedfor it.(c) Nor do we know where we stand as regards Congress support for thewar effort.(d) There is no suggestion that the Quit India Resolution  would hewithdrawn.(e) We are not clear as to precise meaning of statement in paragraph 3 (e)of your telegram that Jinnah would agree to a Government of the kind proposed &quot; without prejudice to Pakistan.&quot;(/) How would the 20 per cent, minority seats in the Council be selected andcomposed 1  Would they include non-Congress Hindus and non-muslim league Muslims ?   If so, the figure would hardly seem sufficient.(g) Would Indian officials be eligible for appointment to the Council ?
4. We feel that we must know exactly what the scheme means before wecan consider it. We agree,&apos; that being so, to further exploration. But we thinkthat this should be entirely non-committal; that it should be by your private secretary and not by you, and that you should remain in reserve until we know better how we stand and His Majesty&apos;s Government have been able toconsider the situation. We would be glad if your Private Secretary could clear-up points taken in paragraph 3 (a) to (g) above, with any others which you wish toraise. We will then consider as a matter of urgency on receiving your further report.5. We feel sure that you will not misunderstand the caution with which weapproach this matter. Desai&apos;s authority is by no means clear. -He may well bea stalking horse, and we have to give weight to much besides the internal positionin India in making up our minds.ANNEX II.Cypher Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated New Delhi,IkthJanuary, 1945.(Received 15-15 hours, 14th January, 1945.)(Secret.)109-S.Superintendent series. At his own request Bhulabhai Desai saw my private secretary by (.? appointment) on 13th January, afternoon. He had not statedin advance the business he wished to discuss, but had told the Private Secretaryhe might wish to see me later.2., Desai began conversation by saying that he believed in co-operation withrather than opposition to British; that Gandhi, with whom he recently spenttwo days, supported or at least acquiesced in the suggestions he was about tomake; that he had discussed these suggestions with Nawabzada Liaqat Ali Khan,Jinnah&apos;s deputy, who approved them; and that he was confident that Jinnah had also approved them behind the scenes.3. He then developed his plan as follows : (a) I should send for him andJinnah and ask them to assist me to form interim Government at Centre. I could see him and Jinnah together or separately, as I thought best, (b) He and Jinnahwould then consult groups.in Indian Legislature and submit list of nominees.Selection would be made by elected members of the Legislature, but would not be confined to members. He had not considered whether number of names submittedshould be greater than or equal to number of portfolios, (c) The League could be&quot;squared&quot; about communal proportions. Desai indicated equal number for league and Congress (40 per cent, each) and fair degree (20 per cent.) for otherminorities, but was not very definite, (a) Interim Government would work withinpresent Constitution, but all members except Governor-General and Commander -in-Chief would be Indians, (e) There would be no commitments on long-termsolution. Jinnah would agree to a Government of the kind proposed withoutprejudice to Pakistan. Long-term solution might be easier when Interim Govern-ment had been in office for a year or so. (/) In Provinces Ministers now workingwould not be interfered with, though there might be adjustments based on partyagreements with which His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be concerned.Section 93 Administrations (? would) go, and Congress Governments would returnto office, but would include League representatives by party agreement, (g) Therewould be no general elections at Centre or in Provinces, (h) Detenus wouldnot be released before formation of Interim Central Government. the interim Central Government might decide to release them, as there had beenrumours for some days of agreement on these lines between Desai and LiaqatAli Khan.* I suspected this was coming, and told my Private Secretary to confine himself to hearing what Desai had to say, only asking such questions as were necessary to get his views clear. Private Secretary, therefore, did not raise question of support for (? war) effort or other questions likely to give theimpression (? that he) was authorised (% to) negotiate. He informed Desai thathe would repeat his views to me.5 (sic). This development cannot be disregarded. I intend to see Desai on20th January after my return from tour. Move is undoubtedly important and0 appears) to spring from a genuine rapprochement between certain Congress* ( ? Para, 4 omitted.)
and League elements. The proposals put forward are moderate so far as theygo at present. How far Gandhi and Jinnah&apos;really approve I cannot yet say, butDesai is an experienced politician, and is (? probably) sure of his ground. Hisplan hangs (? together) (? quite) well, except that method of selecting new members of Government is unsatisfactory, and I could not accept as a matterof course list prepared on these lines. Also I consider it would be (? necessary)to. call representatives of other interests into discussion.6. I should like to discuss proposals with Desai (? as) first step on assump-tion that His Majesty&apos;s Government would approve scheme of this kind if I was satisfied that it was genuine and provided reasonable basis for political progresswithout detriment (? to) war effort. I would report to you after seeing Desaiwith a view to further discussion with Jinnah and others if (? - prospect)sappeared favourable (% and I) received authority from His Majesty&apos;s Government.I should (? propose) to inform present Executive Council as soon as negotiations were in sight.
