THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT--iPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.Copy No. 3 war CABINET.PRESERVATION OF CIVILIAN RESPIRATORS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security..1. I have recently had to consider the fate of civilian gas masks at theend of hostilities in Europe. If they were not to be left to the scrap heap,arrangements would need to be made soon for their eventual recovery from thepublic.2. I was advised that if they were collected, the best of them, with theunissued reserves held by my Department, could, with reasonable storage, be keptefficient for five years at least (say to 1950), so as to be available for re-issue tothe public. In this way an insurance against gas would be maintained until such time as it could be decided whether or not new, and perhaps improved,types ought to be manufactured to provide for a much longer term of years.3. I have consulted the Chiefs of Staff. They have given me an interimreply that they &quot; think that, as a reasonable insurance over the next few years,&quot;I &quot; should make arrangements for the collection and storage of civilianrespirators.&quot; The reply is of an interim character because the Chiefs of staff are examining the scale and nature of the Civil Defence organisation which thecountry will need after the war; but it adds that, in the meantime, it is safe to assume for planning purposes that a Civil Defence organisation will be anessential part of the country&apos;s post-war defence systems The ;War cabinet have since agreed in general with my proposal to this effect.4. It would be a great, advantage to make a public announcement now,both with a view to the preservation of the respirators now with the public andfor warning local authorities that collection will later be required; but in viewof the comments the statement may attract I should not wish to make any announcement without consulting my colleagues. A draft announcement is appended to this paper.5. I do not envisage that the repacking and storage of these respiratorswill involve any large post-war expenditure. My department already operatesa respirator factory at Blackburn and holds storage space which was specificallyprovided for respirators in 1937-39.H. M.Home Office and Ministry of Home Security,Whitehall, S.W.1,9th January, 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 17.9th January, 1945.Draft Public Announcement.The Government has decided that, even after the end of hostilities in Europe,it will be prudent to maintain a stock of civilian respirators in the country whichcan again be distributed to the public if occasion arose.Pending the manufacture of a new supply of respirators (which would inany case take some years to accomplish), the Government is advised that the[28995]
present respirators can be kept effective and technically satisfactory for several years to come.Accordingly, when the course of hostilities in Europe makes it no longer necessary for the public to possess respirators, the Minister of Home Security willask local authorities to collect and return the respirators now in the hands of thepublic. The best of these respirators, together with the unissued reserves heldby the Department, will be reconditioned and preserved as the country&apos;s post-warinsurance.Civilian respirators include not only the ordinary adult respirator, but alsothe special types for children, babies and invalids.The public is asked to co-operate, first by continuing to preserve theirrespirators from all avoidable damage, and secondly by helping the local author-ities, when the time comes, in the arrangements for collecting them.
