p 11^il^^JE^Ii.i^EB. PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted- for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 30.15th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.UNITED KINGDOM STOCK POSITION.Note by the Lord President of the Council.1. At their meeting on the 12th January (L.P. (45) 2nd Meeting,Minute 3) the Lord Presidents Committee were informed by the Minister ofProduction and the Minister of War Transport that in connection with the survey of shipping resources which was now taking place in Washington, theyhad informed the Minister of State that we were undertaking a review of theUnited Kingdom stock position in London in association with the AmericanMission for Economic Affairs. The shipping resources survey is likely to disclosea shortage of tonnage which will rise to serious dimensions in the second quarter of 1945 and in the discussions with Mr. Harry Hopkins there has beenconstant and insistent pressure upon us to review the United Kingdom stock position in order to determine whether a reduction of imports into the UnitedKingdom in the second quarter of 1945 could not be secured by allowing somerunning down of stocks.2. The Lord Presidents Committee were sa tisfred that a review of thekind proposed would be necessary if we were to make good our claim to shippingassistance, and endorsed the action which had been taken. The Committee felt,however, that the matter should be reported to the War Cabinet.3. The attention of the Committee was drawn to the fact that the presentshipping situation was largely due to the fact that under the time-table agreed for operations in the Far East large amounts of shipping were required in the pacific at a time when the operational needs in Europe were still at an exceptionally high level. It was also pointed out that the further examinationof the problem might bring up considerations which ought to be brought to thenotice of those responsible for the scale and timing of military operations.C. R. APrivy Council Office, S.W. 1,15th January, 1945.[.29037]
