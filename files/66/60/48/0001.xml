(45) 31.15thJanuary, 1945.WAR CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR four weeks ENDING  31st DECEMBER,  1944.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.A. A detailed summary of operations is appended.B. Results of Operations.1. German Towns.A large number of attacks was made on German towns during the period.Ludwigshafen, attacked on the 15th/16th December, suffered very heavy damage,particularly in the area of the I.G. Farben works between the nitric acid plant to the north and the experimental synthetic oil plant towards the southern end(see Print No. 1). Damage was also caused to the new power plant, the oil refinery, and the railway workshops and stores. Four storage tanks of the petroleum depot of Deutsche/Americanische Petroleum-Gesellschaft were destroyed and two others damaged. The entire centre of Heilbronn was destroyed in a raid on the 4th / 5th December (see Print No. 2) and only the suburbs to theextreme south and west escaped heavy damage.The attack made on Witten on the 12th December, using the G.H.navigational aid, was an outstanding success. There were very few cratersoutside the built-up area, and the very considerable areas of damage include manyindustrial buildings and factories. Print No. 3 shows the damage done at Ulmon the 17th/18th December when the western half of the city centre wasdevastated and the main station buildings were gutted. In the raid onOberhausen on the 4th December, severe damage was inflicted on the sulphuricacid plant; the railway station and the colliery were also damaged. Siegensuffered considerable industrial damage in an attack on the 16th December, andthe railway repair shops were gutted. Heavy damage was caused in attacks onTrier, which was also bombed &quot;by the U.S. 8th and 9th Air Forces; the mainpassenger station was almost completely destroyed.Other towns attacked during the period include Essen, where damage was done to the Krupps works, Munich, Karlsruhe and Duisburg.2. Transportation Targets.With the object of causing as much disruption as possible to enemy com-munications carrying supplies and reinforcements to the Western front, attacks were made on marshalling yards in Germany, and these were intensified whenthe German offensive in the Ardennes opened. The marshalling yard at Giessenwas very heavily attacked on the 6th/7th December, as Print No. 4 shows; threerail-bridges over the roadway- and the important fly-over bridges were destroyed or very badly damaged. The town also suffered heavily, the main built-up area to the north being almost completely devastated by fire; the buildings damagedinclude a rubber works, the arsenal, the gas and water works, engineering works and the power station.At both Cologne (Nippes) and Soest marshalling yards successful attacks were made, many tracks &apos; being severed and much &quot;rolling-stock destroyed.Considerable additional damage was done to the marshalling yards at Hammand the locomotive depot and station at Bingen were badly damaged most of thelines severed and all the carriage sidings hit. Photographs show numerous[29043]
craters in the marshalling yard at osnabruck caused by the attack on the6th/7th December. Marshalling yards at Rheydt, Bonn, munchen-Gladbach,Troisdorf and the railway workshops at Opladen were also attacked.3. Oil Targets.Attacks were made on the two largest synthetic oil plants in Germany,at Pdlitz and Leuna (Merseburg). Photographs of the plant at Leuna, whichhas also been attacked by the U.S.A.A.F., show that the synthetic oil and newchemical sections are badly damaged, but that some parts of the old works arein use. It is probable that the plant will shortly be able to work to 30 per cent,of capacity, but no further increase is likely for at least one or two months.The Benzol plant at Osterfeld, which was attacked by G.H. aircraft on the11th December, is shown by photographs to be damaged at the eastern end, and much damage can be seen in the built-up area. As photographs had shown thatthe old part of the Scholven Buer synthetic oil plant was 50 per cent, active,aircraft were despatched on the 29th/30th December to put the plant out of actionagain.4. Naval Targets.Gdynia, in the Gulf of Danzig, where the battleship lutzow and other enemynaval units were located, was bombed on the 18th/19th December. photographs show that a floating dock with a vessel in it was sunk and several small vessels were sunk or damaged. The New Shipyard is also seen to be damaged, and thereis a concentration of craters in the naval dockyard. The attack made by 17 air-craft carrying 12,000 lb. bombs on the E.- and R.-boat pens at Ijmuiden onthe 15th. December caused severe damage to the pens. Part of the roof measuring120 ft. by 130 ft. over four of the pen entrances collapsed and another hit, which caused a hole in the roof about 15 ft. across, appears to have penetrated intothe shelter. Photographs of poor quality show that direct hits were scored onthe E.- and P.-boat pens at Rotterdam on the 29th December but, until furtherphotographs are obtained, no detailed assessment of damage is possible.5. Other Targets.As part of a plan principally carried out by the United States 8th Air force to immobilise the enemy fighters, attacks Avere made on the airfields at Essen/Mulheim, Dusseldorf/Lohausen and Bonn/Hangelar. All three airfields were heavily craterecl and rendered unserviceable, and a number of aircraft were destroyed on the ground.Troop concentrations were attacked at Houffalize and at St. Vith. Photo-^graphs show that the latter attack was extremely successful and completelyprevented the passage of troops through that area at a crucial stage of the battle.6. Results of Previous Attacks.Print No. 5 shows the complete devastation caused in the attack on Freiburgon the 27th/28th November. Prints Nos. 6 to 11 show the results of recent attacks on Cologne, Duren, Bochum, Duisburg, Dusseldorf and the Krupps works atEssen.C. Sea Mining.During the second fortnight of the period mines were laid off Danzig andSwinemunde, in the Cadet Channel, in the approaches to Aarhus and Frederiks-havn, in the main swept channels of the Kattegat and in the approaches toOslo, Moss, Horten, Porsgrund and Sandefjord. Results show that the enemyfleet of minesweepers has been unable to prevent very severe delays affectingimportant sea-borne traffic. Nearly all the routes in the Eastern Baltic were closed directly after the second mine-laying operation in the Gulf of Danzigand reconnaissance photographs showed 26 ships held up outside Swinemunde.After the mine-laying in the approaches to Oslo, Moss and Horten, enemy trans-ports and freighters were diverted to other railhead ports in the vicinity andtherefore, in order to increase enemy difficulties, mines were laid in the approaches to the ports of Porsgrund and Sandefiord.A.
