tITHI3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT0*printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. Copy No,   3gW.P. (45) 28.j11th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.RELIEF FOR OCCUPIED EUROPE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Minister of Economic Warfare.ON the 7th November (see W.M. (44) 147, Minute 1) the Cabinet reconsideredthe recommendation of the Anglo-American Relief Committee that relief from outside the blockade should be allowed to occupied Poland and Norway. Wewere invited to report in greater detail the amount and nature of the food-stuffsinvolved and the tonnage required to carry them.(a) Poland.2. Small quantities (of food and medicines at the most 200 tons a month)are now sent from Switzerland and distributed by the International Red Crossin conditions which we can regard as satisfactory. Transport between Switzer-land and Poland is uncertain and it is impossible to estimate precisely what further quantity could be carried. An increase is, however, certainly possible and we recommend that up to 1,000 tons of supplies a month should be allowedthrough the blockade. These would include small quantities of used clothing,and medicines but would consist mainly of mixed food-stuffs such as dried milk,tinned meat and fats. The exact monthly quantity would depend upon the ability of the International Red Cross to arrange transport and effective distribution.&apos;(b) Norway.We now permit a minimum of 500 tons a month, mainly vegetables, to be sent from Sweden. More can probably be sent without any compensation from Alliedstocks, but Sweden cannot provide the fats which are increasingly needed in norway since the Germans discontinued all such imports early this year. We,therefore, recommend that in addition 500 tons of fats and milk a month shouldbe allowed through the blockade. We also recommend exceptional approval of aparticular consignment. A cargo of lard is on its way from the Argentineto Sweden and 2,000 tons could be distributed in Norway through secret channels.This would not be used for current consumption but for the very valuable purposeof completing a reserve against the breakdown of distribution which would follow a rising.3. It was originally intended that the supplies through the blockade shouldbe shipped to Gothenburg on the Swedish safe-conduct ships. It now appearslikely, as a result of the complete cessation of Swedish exports to Germany, thatthe Germans will not allow this traffic to continue. In that event we recommendthat the Swedish Government should be asked to invite the Germans to allow aSwedish ship or ships to sail to and from Gothenburg for the express purposeof carrying relief supplies.4. Apart from a negligible quantity which might be supplied by privatecharity here, all relief from outside the blockade would come from the western hemisphere principally from United States and Canadian stocks. The UnitedStates Government wish to supply and send relief and are, asking only that weshould not raise objections. They will be greatly disappointed if, having setup a joint committee, we reject its recommendations, but the merits of theproposals themselves are considerable. The situation in Norway is already12635   [29029]
precarious. As refugees arrive from the north it will deteriorate sharply andif. as they well may, the Germans cut off. all imports, from.Denmark it willbecome very serious indeed. Conditions in Poland are worse than in any other part of Europe. Seven hundred thousand people who&quot; endured the siege &quot;ofWarsaw are existing at starvation level without adequate clothing and withfar less than a minimum of medical supplies. Without help from outsideconditions can only become even worse. Relief from outside the blockade 4sthe only way of preventing a catastrophe.5. We are proposing relief in very small quantities. It could do the enemycomparatively little good and it could alleviate only a fraction of the distress. but these small quantities would save the lives of some of our Allies who may otherwise die of starvation before the spring. For this and for political reasonswe trust that our colleagues will accept our proposals.A. E.S.11th January, 1945.
