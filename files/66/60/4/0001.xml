(44) 754.19th December, 1944.A WAR CABINET.MOTOR VEHICLE LIGHTING.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.THE American Headquarters Staff have applied to the Anglo-american co-ordinating Committee for the complete relaxation of restrictions on theheadlamps of motor vehicles. They have represented that this is an immediateoperational necessity. Delay in securing possession of the continental ports hasoccasioned delay in transferring reinforcing units from this country, where the vehicles are assembled, equipped and re-embarked to a time-table. The lighting restrictions are said to have prevented adherence to the time-table and to havedelayed the arrival of reinforcements at the front. The need for unrestrictedvehicle lighting will continue until at least the middle of January next.2. From preliminary discussion at the official level with the civil and service departments primarily concerned it has become clear that the decision must be governed by the degree of operational need. On the security aspect the Air Stafffind it difficult to give a final opinion in advance of the new Joint IntelligenceSub-Committee appreciation, but on present information both they and theAdmiralty would prefer for the present not to go beyond the introduction of someintermediate standard, the former in view of the assistance that the increasedlighting might give, particularly in the metropolitan area, in the aiming of flyin bombs, the latter on account of possible assistance to enemy submarines operatingclose inshore. It was agreed, however, that both these considerations would beoutweighed if a serious operational requirement were established. The WarOffice, who are suffering from similar difficulties, would raise no objection andwould Welcome a relaxation- for their own vehicles, though the type of lamp in use would not afford the equivalent of an unmasked headlamp.3. The same consideration applies to traffic difficulties generally. The main problems created on the roads are two  (a) A large proportion of vehicles now operating ail vehicles, Service or civilian, built since 1941 have been equipped with headlamps wherethe masks form an integral part of the fitting and are not separable.The drivers of such vehicles will be unable to share in the relaxationwithout securing fresh equipment, which it will take at least six weeks to put in production, and will for the time being be at a disadvantagewhen meeting vehicles with peace-time headlamps. Many vehicles,again, have now no dipping device. The dazzle problem will thus be serious and is likely to give rise to severe and not unjustifiedcriticism.(b) The effect on pedestrians and cyclists is difficult to assess beforehand, but may, especially in unlighted towns, at road crossings and elsewhere,lead to increased numbers of accidents.4. It must be recognised, therefore, that the use of unrestricted headlampsis likely to be an addition to the dangers of road transport which could be justifiedonly by the clearest necessity.[28869]
5. This being the position, I have had the operational aspect examined indetail with the American Headquarters Staff and have received assurances thatthe restrictions on headlamps have materially delayed the urgent transport ofmen and materials through the United Kingdom, and that the increase of speedto be gained by the removal of restrictions will be a direct contribution to theconduct of the operations now proceeding. The need is the greater because thenumber of vehicles available is limited, and speed is essential to enable them tobe employed to the best advantage. I have also ascertained that the headlampswith which these vehicles are equipped are fitted with a device which enables thebeam to be thrown downwards on passing other vehicles. These enquiries havesatisfied me that permission to use full headlamps should not be withheld.6.   If this view is accepted, two courses are possible :  (a) The relaxation might be given to the American Forces only and confined to the period of operational urgency, i.e., up to mid-January;(b) It might be given universal effect; but if this were done, a reversion torestricted lights may not be practical politics unless some new and serious position should arise. It is possible that there may be a public demand for the reversion.7. I have come to the conclusion that the latter course is preferable. Alreadycomplaints about the excessive light on American vehicles are numerous, and thediscontent caused has been reflected by questions in the House. This feeling wouldbe aggravated if a distinction between lights allowed to the American Forces andthose allowed to the ordinary citizen were officially recognised.8. In. practice, again, it would be impracticable to authorise for one sectionof road-users a standard of lighting which was denied to others. The british war Department would claim and could not be refused the same privilege, whichcould hardly be withheld in turn from the Supply Departments or from firms engaged in the manufacture and transport of urgently required munitions. Itwould no-longer be possible to maintain that the restrictions imposed on the minority who fall in none of these categories were dictated by security require-ments, and their exclusion would be impossible to defend.9. It appears accordingly that the only practicable way of meeting presentAmerican requirements is a complete relaxation of all restrictions on headlampsfor all road-users throughout the country, and I should be glad to have the consentof my colleagues to this proposal.10. It would be necessary, in announcing a relaxation in respect of head-lamps, to make clear to the public the reasons for which it has been made. Inreply to recent questions in the House and letters from individual members, Ihave maintained that both security and traffic factors stand in the way of anearly relaxation for headlamps. These considerations remain valid and I shouldnot be prepared to sponsor a sudden change of policy without stating publicly that this was so and that the only ground that could prevail over these considera-tions is that of operational necessity. I have ascertained that the american military authorities would have no objection to this being published. I should propose to add a warning that it might in certain circumstances become necessaryto reintroduce a measure of restriction.11. A relaxation in respect of headlamps will entail relaxations in respectof certain other minor classes of vehicle light such as fog-lamps, traffic indicatorsand possibly side-lights. Cyclists, again, would have a legitimate grievance ifany restrictions were left on cycle lighting when motor vehicles were running withpeace-time headlamps. These and any other consequential changes would bemade either simultaneously or as early as possible after restrictions on headlampswere removed.H.
