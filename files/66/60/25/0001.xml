The mine totals are 6,233 ground and 8,151 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.17. It is believed that of 200 cargo ships planned for construction inGermany, Holland, Belgium and Denmark under the Hansa programme duringthe years 1943-5 some 40 ships, each of 2,000 tons, have been completed. Of 93ships seen under construction during October last, 11 of 59,000 tons are assumed to have been lost in Belgian ports.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.) ...   -YGeneral.18. During.the past week Allied counter-measures have succeeded instabilising the position on both flanks of the German break-through. On thenorthern flank the enemy&apos;s attitude has been defensive and he has at some pointsbeen forced to yield ground. On the southern flank the Third U.S. Armycounter-attack has made good progress along its entire front, having recapturedEchternach and advanced to the River Sure. -On the 1st the enemy opened a new series of attacks in the Saar covering a30-mile front from Neunhofen (10 miles west of Bitche) to Sarreguemines.On the remainder of the front activity has been relatively small.Southern Sector. . -&apos;&apos; &apos;     .19. The First French Army has made slight gains southwards towardsColmar,The Seventh U.S. Army sector remained quiet until the 1st, when the enemylaunched a series of attacks on a 30-mile front.  The main effort appears to be on[28958] . &apos;; * &apos; &apos;:: b   &apos; &apos;&apos; &apos;-;
the west flank, some 10 miles west of Bitche, where an advance of some 4 mileshas been made on an 8-mile front..West of Sarreguemines further slight enemy gains have been made tostraighten out an Allied salient. However, nowhere has the enemy brokenthrough Allied positions and his gains have cost him dearly.Central Sector.20. On the southern flank of the enemy break-through in the Ardennes theThird U.S. Army has steadily forced the enemy back. On the right flankEchternach was retaken on the 28th December. In the Centre we have crossed the River Sure and struck northwards to within 1 mile of Wiltz, and the corridorto Bastogne has been so strengthened and widened that it now presents a dangerous salient from the enemy&apos;s point of view. The enemy is reactingstrongly to this threat and has thrown in numerous but unsuccessful counter-attacks against this salient. On the west flank the Third U.S. Army launched a.further attack northwards on the 30th; this attack was met with determinedresistance and by the 4th our leading troops were still within 2 miles S.E. of st. Hubert.At the west end of the salient, conditions in the gap between the southern andnorthern flanks of the break-through have remained fluid. Allied armouredpatrols operating eastwards from the Meuse have reached St. Hubert where theenemy are still holding the eastern outskirts of the town.On the northern flank the Germans fought stubbornly in Rochefort until the30th, but Allied troops entering the town the next day found it unoccupied withthe bridges across the River Homme blown.On the 3rd the First U.S. Army launched an attack east of Hotton; initialprogress of some 2,000 yards was made against stiffening resistance includingminefields and dug-in tanks.Northern Sector.21. Activity has again been confined to local actions and patrolling north of Geilenkirchen. The enemy attacked a village on the 30th but British troopsquickly restored the position and captured over 100 prisoners.German patrols have made further crossings of the Meuse in the vicinity ofRoermond and Hertogenbosch, but on each occasion they have been driven back and forced to withdraw across the river.tItaly.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)22. The enemy offensive on the western coastal sector caused U.S. coloured troops of Fifth Army to give some ground, which included the town of Barga.During the last few days, however, the enemy offensive appears to have died away and Fifth Army troops have regained Barga and much of the ground initially lost.Activity on the rest of the front was slight except in the Adriatic coastalsector, where early on the morning of the 2nd, Canadian forces went over to the offensive in the area east of Alfonsine. Supported by armour, our troops forcedthe enemy, after, heavy armoured fighting, to withdraw to the north of the CanaleBonifica, which runs south of and parallel to the River Reno.The Eastern European Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.23.   The Germans have reported further Russian attacks in N.W. Latvia.Southern Sector.24. The Russians have pressed the Germans back across the Czechoslovak-Hungarian frontier south of Lucenec and thus broadened the base of the salientwhich extends westwards to Levice.The enemy forces isolated in the Budapest area, were split into two groups,one in the city itself and the other a little further north. After a few daysfighting, the northern group was destroyed and the other is being heavily attackedwithin the city boundary.Further south, in the difficult country between Budapest and Lake Balaton,the Russians are keeping up their pressure but without gaining much ground.The Germans have been counter-attacking S.E. of Komarno.
Greece.A thens.25. During the past week Allied troops have completed clearing the majorityof the southern suburbs of Athens. The bulk of our forces have now been trans-ferred to the north of the capital where an offensive was launched against theN.E. suburbs on the 2nd.Further areas of the piraeus are under our control.Western Greece.26.   Zervas troops have all been evacuated from the mainland to Corfu.A number of Zervas troops are also holding the island of Levkas, but E.L.A.S.have taken the small island of Meganesi which lies off the east coast of Levkas.Peloponnese.27.   E.L.A.S. troops hold the tactical features surrounding Patras.Burma.28. In the Arakan our troops have made further progress. Foul Point,the southernmost tip of the Mayu Peninsula, was reached without oppositionon the 28th December.On the Eastern bank of the Mayu River, Rathedaung was reached on the30th December after an advance in small craft without contact. On the same day Hparabyin, further up the river, was occupied.Taking advantage of the negligible enemy opposition in the Arakan our troops carried out an assault-landing on Akyab Island on the 3rd. The landingwas made on the N:W. coast and no opposition was encountered. It is reportedthat the Japanese garrison is withdrawing north-eastwards.In the Kaladan Valley, our troops have made little further progress. Theyare now in light contact with the enemy in the area 6 miles east of Kyauktaw.Considerable advances have been made between the Chindwin and theIrrawaddy. On the east bank of the Chindwin our troops are in the area 9 miles east of Ywathit. Enemy positions on the road Pyingaing-Ye-U, 10 miles S.E.of Pyingaing, held up leading elements of our forces advancing on Ye-U forthree days. On the 29th these positions were captured and the advancecontinued. Kabo &quot;Weir was taken intact on the 2nd and Ye-U was occupied onthe 3rd.  Other Allied troops have cut the road running N.E. from Kabo Weir.Tagaung, on the east bank of the Irrawaddy, was occupied by our troops onthe 3rd. The Chinese have made further progress in their advance towardsNamhkam, now only 6 miles away.China.29. For the time being, the situation in China appears to have becomestabilised, with Japanese forces still in control of the railway from Liuchow tothe neighbourhood of Hochih.No further information has been received about the Japamese columnsmoving N.E. from the Wuchow area.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.30. The number of sorties flown by Fighter Command against flying-bombs,which were only plotted on one night of the week, was reduced to 36.Attacks on long-range rocket sites are referred to in para. 32, while detailsof enemy activity against this country are reported under &apos;&apos; Enemy Activity and home Security.&quot;Home Waters.31. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 892 sorties; 4 aircraft are missing.   .Aircraft of Coastal Command attacked shipping off the coast of Norwayseveral times during the week, obtaining hits on 3 medium-sized vessels and leaving 5 others on fire.[28958] b 2
Heavies of Bomber Command on one night dropped 230 tons of bombs on enemy shipping at Horten and Moss (S. Norway), but results were unobserved.Lancasters operated in daylight against E/.U-boat pens at Rotterdam, on whichdirect hits were obtained with 12.000 lb. bombs.Bomber Command laid 294 sea mines.Y/estern Europe.32. During the week ended dawn on the 3rd, aircraft of S.H.A.E.E. (Air)flew 14,017 sorties and dropped 4,430 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawn onthe 4th, Bomber Command and the U.S: VIII Bomber Command flew 12,758 sorties and dropped 34,014 tons. Fighter Command and the U.S. VIII FighterCJommand flew 6,392 sorties. Four hundred and thirty enemy aircraft were destroyed, and 289 Allied aircraft are missing.Although bad weather continued to hamper the observation of results of bombing operations against targets in and behind the battle number ofrailway centres and bridges was attacked both by day and by night. In theformer category were included Cologne (2,491 tons), Bonn (905 tons), Coblenz(2,129 tons), Frankfurt (367 tons), Cassel (1,380 tons), Kaiserslautern (671 tons),Munchen G-ladbach (753 tons), Troisdorf (605 tons) and Osterfeld (809 tons). Inmost cases pathfinder technique was employed but at Cologne and Coblenz (bothbombed twice), Bonn and Troisdorf, the glow from fires and explosions indicatedvery good concentrations of bombing.Communication centres immediately behind the battle area were attacked on four days by a total of 722 heavy bombers which released 1,692 tons.Among a number of railway bridges those at Remagen (697 tons), Irlich(1,033 tons) and Coblenz (837 tons), were each bombed on several occasions butresults were mainly unobserved.On,the night 30th/31st December a force of Lancasters dropped 507 tonson a concentration of enemy troops, armour and supplies at Houffalize (N.E. ofBastogne). Although results were difficult to assess, a fair concentration isbelieved to have been obtained.On the 1st, the Dortmund-Ems Canal at Ladbergen was once again attacked by Lancasters (430 tons). A large breach was made in one wall of the westernarm of the canal, which caused considerable flooding. That night another forceof Lancasters dropped 701 tons on the Mitelland Canal at Gravenhorst in clearweather. Bombing is believed to have been successful, but delayed-action bombs were used and results could not be seen.Good results were also obtained when Mosquitoes attacked 14 railway tunnelsbehind the battle area, hits being registered on 12 of the primary targets.Oil targets received attention both by day and by night, and results in themain were good. Fires and explosions were caused, and smoke seen through cloudto a height of 14,000 feet, when 323 heavies dropped 1,615 tons on Buer synthetic oil plant. Good results were also obtained against similar targets at Hamburg(573 tons), Misburg (208 tons), Dollbergen (124 tons) and against a coking plant at Dortmund (373 tons). The chemical works at Ludwigshafen was very success-fully bombed by night (1,217 tons) and very large fires caused. Industries andtransport facilities at Nuremberg received 2,052 tons in one attack by night inexcellent visibility. Bombing was well concentrated and fires were seen over150 miles away on the return journey.Among other targets operated against during the week was a Gestapo H.Q-at Oslo. This was attacked by Mosquitoes which obtained a number of hits inwell concentrated bombing. Over 60 Mosquitoes were employed on each of two operations over Hanover and Berlin respectively, and in both cases results are believed to have been good.Spitfires of Fighter Command carried out several successful attacks againstlong-range rocket sites in Holland.In the battle area bombers of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) were prevented by bad weatherfrom operating on several days. Road and railway junctions and other targets were, however, attacked and a considerable tonnage of bombs dropped. excellent results were reported after attacks against communications in the Saarbrucken/Karlsruhe areas.Fighters and fighter-bombers gave close support to land forces and carriedout many armed reconnaissances. In the course of these operations more than390 locomotives. 4,000 railway wagons, 1,400 M.T. and 360 A.F.V. were destroyed or damaged, and railways cut in 230 places.
Aircraft carrying supplies to the Continent flew 1,027. sorties, while157 others landed troops in the Bastogne area.In the course of the week enemy aircraft were encountered in force on three occasions. In one instance, out of about 125 met by heavy bombers, 40 were destroyed by escorting fighters in the Luneburg/Spandau areas. In the secondcase 26 aircraft were destroyed near Hamburg among 90/100 engaged; while inthe third, escorting fighters destroyed 59 out of over 200 also encountered in theHamburg and Hanover districts.w. On the 1st, a number of enemy fighters estimated at 500/600 attacked13 Allied airfields during daylight. One hundred and sixty-seven Allied aircraft(principally fighters) were destroyed or very seriously damaged on the ground.Reports received show that 335 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 10 probably destroyed and 119 damaged in combat and by A.A.Note: Appendices VII and VIII give Raid Assessments and OperationalStatistics respectively.Southern Europe.33.
