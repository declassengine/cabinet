THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY--S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. ,.y Copy No.W.P. (45) 26.13 h January, 1945.WAR CABINET.PREPARATION OF THE BUSINESS VOTERS&apos; REGISTER.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I have carefully and sympathetically considered the Lord Privy Seal&apos;smemorandum of the 11th January (W.P. (45) 20), but the decision that thereshall now be a fixed register in place of a continuing register does not remove thedifficulties in the way of putting the business voter on the business voters&apos; registerwithout requiring him to make a claim.2. The pre-war system of compiling an electoral register was by means ofa canvass. By the machinery of the canvass the Registration Officer was enabled to ascertain what persons were entitled to be registered as business premisesvoters. Under the present day conditions a canvass is impracticable, and the compilation of the civilian voters&apos; register has been based on the national registration machinery. The National Registration machinery, however, doesnot show, and cannot be made to show, what persons are entitled to business premises votes. Consequently, there is no possibility of compiling the register ofbusiness premises voters unless claims are made by such voters.3. The amendment to which the Lord Privy Seal draws attention and whichwas defeated by 146 votes to 112 in the Committee Stage of the 1943 Bill was an amendment to require the Registration Officer to send a form and a reminder to every business voter. The reason why it&apos; was necessary to oppose this amendmentwas, as stated by Mr. Peake on behalf of the Government, not merely that the registration Officer had not the time or the staff to do this, but that in a largenumber of cases he had no means of ascertaining what persons were likely to bein a position to make a claim. The objection to any provision such as that in theamendment to which the Lord Privy Seal refers is exactly the same to-day as itwas in 1943.4. I very carefully considered in 1943 the question whether any way could befound of making it easier for the business premises voter to get his name on theregister, with a genuine desire to meet the point if it were practicable. I fully recognise that, so long as the business premises voter is entitled to exercise thisvote, it is the duty of the Home Office to do everything possible to facilitate hisgetting on the register, but so long as the main work of compiling the registeris done through the machinery of the National Registration system, there is no possibility of avoiding the necessity of placing on the business voter theresponsibility for making a claim.5. The business voter is in the same position as the Service voter. TheService voter cannot be put on the electoral register through the national registration machinery. Consequently, he has to take the initiative by filling upa form showing his address to enable his name to be placed on the electoral register.6. It does not seem to me that the potential business voter can fairlycomplain if, for practical reasons, he is put in no worse position than the Servicevoter.7. When the second register comes to be prepared in the autumn of 1945and when subsequent registers come to be prepared, there will be no difficulty in arranging that the Registration Officer shall send forms of claim to all persons whose names appear on the previous register of business voters.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,13th January, 1945.[29028]
