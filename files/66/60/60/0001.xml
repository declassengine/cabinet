THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 43.21st January, 1945HOUSE   OF   COMMONS  DISQUALIFICATION   (TEMPORARY   PROVISIONS) ACT, 1941, AND THE SERVANTS OF THE CROWN(PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATURE) ORDER, 1927.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,THE House of Commons Disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Act of1941 was for one year only, and has been extended from year to year by subse-quent Acts. Unless renewed by a further Act before the 6th March, 1945, itwill expire on that date. Attached (Annex) is a memorandum by parliamentary counsel which deals from the legal aspect with the effect of allowing the act of 1941 to expire and (in paragraphs 5 to 7) with the effect of a dissolution ofParliament on those holders of offices under the Crown who retain their seatsby virtue of the Act. In view of Parliamentary Counsel&apos;s opinion in regardto the position under the Servants of the Crown (Parliamentary Candidature)Order, 1927, in the event of a General Election, it is proposed to consider theterms and scope of the necessary amendments of the Order in Council at the sametime as the question of renewing the Act of 1941.2. The 1927 Order in Council provides that, with certain exceptions not here in point, &quot; No person employed by or sunder the Crown to whom this Order appliesshall issue an address to electors or in. any other manner publicly announce himselfor allow himself to be publicly announced, as a candidate or a prospective candi-date for election to Parliament for any constituency until he has retired orresigned from such employment.&quot; This Order has stood the test of time; its provisions were endorsed in the Report of the Select Committee on Offices orPlaces of Profit under the Crown (House of Commons Paper 120 of 1941) andthere is no call for its amendment in normal times. Any amendment of the order should be confined, like the 1941 Act itself, to the period of the Emergency Powers(Defence) Act, 1939, as being &quot; for the purposes of the present war &quot; only.3. As regards the scope of any such amendment I am of opinion that weshould aim to confine it to those persons who have the benefit of the 1941 Actand that we should resist any pressure or temptation there may be to use theoccasion to deal at the same time with other classes whose parliamentary candi-dature is covered by the 1927 Order in Council, viz., members of the Armed Forces,and temporary civil servants. So far as members of the Armed Forces are con-cerned, officers and men, including regulars, have been allowed, during this war,by administrative action to become candidates for Parliament at by-electionswithout regard to the provision in the 1927 Order in Council for retirement orresignation; and I assume that similar arrangements will apply at any GeneralElection which takes place before the end of the emergency period. The Houseof^Commons (Service in His Majesty&apos;s Forces) Act, 1939, exempts the armed forces, for the duration of the emergency and without numerical limitation, fromthe usual disqualification for membership of the House of Commons, and, since there is no close connection between the Members of Parliament who hold thePrime Minister&apos;s certificate under the 1941 Act and these members of the Forces,I think we may leave the position of the latter alone. As regards temporary civilservants, I understand that the Cabinet is to. be asked to approve a compromisereached by the Minister of Labour and National Service with the representativesof the main Party organisations. That compromise, I should hope, need not involve amendment of the Order in Council.[29076]Copy No.WAR CABINET.
4. I am therefore instructing Parliamentary Counsel to prepare draftamendments to the Order in Council of 1927 on a temporary basis confined to members of Parliament who are brought under the House of Commons Disquali-fication (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1941. If the War Cabinet decide to amend the Order in Council to this extent it will emerge that it is the governments intention to use the Act of 1941 over a General Election, and when the Billto renew the Act comes- before Parliament there may be objection if it does not expressly state that its provisions extend for that purpose. It is therefore for.consideration, whether there should be included in the Bill, if the Act of 1941is to be renewed, a declaratory clause putting the point beyond doubt.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,21 st January, 1945.ANNEX.Note on the Effect of the Expiry of the House of Commons Disqualification(Temporary Provisions) Act, 1941.Memorandum by Parliamentary Counsel.1. This Act enables two classes of office holders to be members of the Houseof Commons notwithstanding that their offices are held under the Crown (a) those in respect of whom a certificate is issued by the Prime Minister. (s.l (1) ); and(b) those who were appointed to their offices between the 3rd September, 1939,and 6th March, 1941, and still hold them (s.l (3)).2. The Act, which was originally to&apos; endure for only one year, has by subsequent Acts been extended from year to year and is due to expire on the6th March, 1945, unless renewed by a further Act before that date.3. The proviso to section 2 (2) of the Act enacts that on the expiry of theAct its provisions &apos;&apos; shall notwithstanding such expiry continue to apply withrespect to the holding by any member of the Commons House of Parliament ofany office or place then held by him.&quot; The result is that a member of the Houseof Commons who holds an office at the date of the expiry of the Act which is either one to which he was appointed between the 3rd September, 1939, and6th March, 1941, or one with respect to which a certificate has been issued inhis favour by the Prime Minister, may continue to hold that office and retainhis seat in the Commons notwithstanding the expiry of the Act.4. The terms of the Act authorise both classes of office holders to retain their seats only &quot; during the present war period,&quot; which is so defined that itwill end when the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, expires. That Act is continued in operation from year to year and will unless further renewed expireon the 23rd August, 1945. Thus there is an overriding limitation to the effectof the Act so that even those members who are entitled to keep their offices andtheir seats after the expiry of the Act of 1941 will have to relinquish either their offices or their seats on the expiry of the Act of 1939.5. It may become necessary to consider what will be the effect of the Actin the event of a dissolution of Parliament. The terms of the Act render, bothclasses of office holders capable not only of sitting and voting but also of being elected as members of the House of Commons and therefore it would seem that office holders of either class who are entitled to retain both their offices and theirseats after the expiry of the Act will, in the event of a dissolution, be capable,while still holding their offices, of being re-elected to the House; but in thisconnection it is necessary also to bear in mind the provisions of the Servants ofthe Crown (Parliamentary Candidature) Order, 1927.6. This Order in Council provides that &quot;no person employed by or underthe Crown to whom this Order applies shall issue an address to electors or inany other manner publicly announce himself or allow himself to be publicly announced as a candidate or a prospective candidate for election to parliament for any constituency until he has retired or resigned from such employment.&quot; This
Order in Council seems clearly to apply to all the office holders at presententitled to sit by virtue of the Act of 1941, unless any of them can be said to fall within the only relevant exception provided,for by the Order. That exceptionis in favour of the holders of &quot; political offices &quot; and that expression is&apos; defined as meaning &quot; any office which is usually held by a member of one or other of theHouses of Parliament.&quot; Attached to this note (overleaf) will be found a listof the persons in respect of whom Prime Minister&apos;s certificates are now in forceand of the offices they hold, and it appears to me very doubtful whether it couldbe said that any of those offices fall within tbat exception. Most of the officeswere created long after 1927 and were obviously therefore not at the date of theOrder in Council &quot; usually held &quot; by anyone. It might perhaps be argued withrespect to the four Ministers who are included in the list that the office of&apos;&apos; Minister &apos;&apos; is one which is usually held by a member of one or other of theHouses of Parliament, but no such argument would apply to the other officesincluded in the list.A further possible argument would be that the express provisions of theAct of 1941 override the provisions of the Order in Council of the 25th July, 1927.but against this it would probably be contended that the Act of 1941 and theOrder in Council of 1927 deal with two different things. The Act is( concerned only with removing the statutory disqualifications upon membership of the Houseof Commons, but the Order in Council is a prerogative Order regulating theconduct of Crown servants and is directed not to any question of qualificationor disqualification, but to preventing Crown servants from engaging in politicalcontests.7. Upon the whole it would in my opinion be unsafe to regard office holderswho are entitled to retain their seats by virtue of the Act of 1941 as being free to seek re-election while holding those offices unless the necessary amendmentsare made in the Servants of the Crown (Parliamentary Candidature) Order. 1927.Office of the Parliamentary Counsel,7, Old Palace Yard,Westminster, S.W.1.   ..p.t.o.
