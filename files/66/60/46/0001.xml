THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT/Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1945. /- 1 O  W.P. (45) 29.15 th January, 1945.SECRET.Copy No. 3 war CABINET.PRIORITIES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.Note by the Prime Minister.AT the present stage of the war research and development projects likely tobe effectively used in operations before the end of 1946 must have the highest priority.Research workers and draughtsmen are scanty and are needed also by industry in preparation for the change-over to peace-time production and for thedevelopment of civil air transport.All Service research and development projects now in hand must, therefore,be reviewed forthwith in the light of current hypotheses about the end of theGerman War and the duration of the Japanese War. Those which are not likelyto be used in operations on a considerable scale in the second half of 1946 shouldbe slowed down or temporarily abandoned so as to permit the maximumconcentration upon the remainder and some release of man-power to civilianproduction.Departments must also review their present practice in making modifications,particularly to obsolescent weapons and equipment (including aircraft), so as to cut out all but those which are essential for operational purposes or to save life.This replaces my directive of the 16th.February, 1943, W.P. (43) 54.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,15th January, 1945.[29034]
