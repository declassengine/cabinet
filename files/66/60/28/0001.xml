THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERHMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. / Copy No.      g gW.P. (45) 11. V5th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.TRAVEL TO FRANCE BY MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security.AT their meeting on the 4th December, 1944 (W.M. (44) 161st Conclusions,Minute 6), the War Cabinet agreed that in present circumstances the Govern-ment must retain the fullest control over visits to France, and that it wasimpossible to admit the right of every Member of Parliament to go to France.It was, however, suggested that it might be practicable to devise a scheme wherebya representative party of Members of Parliament, possibly representing the Anglo-French Committee, should go to France. The War Cabinet invited us to workout a plan on these lines for submission to them.2. Subsequently, the Prime Minister expressed the opinion to us that betterfacilities should be &quot;provided as quickly as possible, and made the suggestionthat Members of Parliament might be allowed to ballot for six places a weekamong their number.3. We have gone into this matter with the joint Chief Whips, and we thinkthat a scheme on the following lines would be practicable and would satisfyMembers of Parliament : (a) If a delegation of Members of Parliament of any party should beinvited by a corresponding political party in France to meet them,the Members of Parliament should be allowed to accept that invitationand to travel to France.(b) If either House of Parliament wishes to send a representative body ofits Members to France, facilities should be given to such a bodywhether or not any express invitation has come from any body inFrance.(c) In addition to these two groups, a limited number of Members of Parlia-ment should be allowed to visit France for the purpose of makingthemselves familiar with conditions there. No doubt some such members of Parliament when in France would take the opportunityof carrying on private business or affairs, but this would not be aninsuperable obstacle to the scheme, nor would it set an awkwardprecedent. This class of traveller should, we think, be selected byballot, and we suggest that the weekly allocation for Memberstravelling under this head might be fixed at six. The question will arise whether a Member lucky in the ballot should be allowed to give his place to another Member. This might, however, give rise to abuses,and it would be preferable to ballot for more places than the avail-able accommodation allowed, to provide for the eventuality of&quot; a luckyMember being unable to go at the last minute. Members would, ofcourse, have to make their own arrangements to obtain a French visaand accommodation in France.4. It is for consideration whether there should be an open ballot in whichall Members would stand the same chance of being selected, or a ballot organised on party lines. Subject to any views which our colleagues may have on thispoint, we should like to reserve it for final settlement after further discussionwith the Chief Whips.[28969]
5. The only other question of importance is whether or not Members ofParliament should be allowed to travel to France free of cost on Serviceaircraft. We do not think that there is any doubt that it would be right to allow the first two categories to travel by Service aircraft and to treat Memberstravelling thus like any other civilians so travelling that is to say, they wouldnot pay fares unless it were decided to charge fares to other civilians. As regardsMembers travelling merely because they were lucky in the ballot, the questionwhether they should be allowed to go by air might be made dependent on thedecision as regards the charging of fares on the Service aircraft. It would beimpossible to accept the proposition that they are entitled to transport at public expense, but, on the other hand, the scheme would be much more acceptable to members of Parliament if they were spared the delays and inconveniences of travelling by rail and sea. If fares have not been introduced at the time thescheme is instituted, the solution may be to allow them to use the air servicefree of charge for the time being, on the clear understanding that they wouldhave to pay fares as soon as these were introduced.6. Any scheme applying to the House of Commons would also have toapply to the House of Lords.7. Applications from Members of Parliament wishing to travel on com-mercial business or on private or compassionate grounds, and not by virtue oftheir membership of Parliament (i.e., category (c)) would, of course, continueto be dealt with in the same way as any other applications from members ofthe public.8. The decision to open a London-Paris sea-rail passenger service on whichcivilians will be allowed to travel on urgent compassionate grounds was announcedyesterday, and it is therefore important that Parliament should be informed ofthe Governments intentions as regards Members of Parliament immediately afterthe Recess. We ask our colleagues to authorise us to proceed with a scheme onthe lines, suggested in this memorandum, subject to any modifications of detailwhich may be necessary as regards the organisation of the ballot, and the use,by Members of Parliament lucky in the ballot, of the Service facilities for airtravel.A.
