THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 39.18th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES BY THE BISHOP OFCHI CHESTER.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.I am sorry to have to bring before the Cabinet what appears to be a smallmatter. The Ministry of Information have been asked by the Bishop of Chichesterto endorse his application for an exit permit and to secure him transport for a visit to the United States during the Spring in order to fulfil an invitation whichhe has received from the Federal Council of Churches in America. The,presiding Bishop of the American Episcopal Church has joined in extending this invitation to him. Dr. Bell has also received a letter from the Archbishop of Yorkapproving his proposed journey.2. The Ministry is extremely doubtful whether it should sponsor Dr. BelTsjourney in this way. He has played a considerable part in politics, having madehimself known in 1939-40 as an advocate of a negotiated peace, and in 1942-43as an opponent of the Governments policy of bombing German towns. the advocates of a &quot; soft peace &quot; in the United States are likely to hail him as a leading exponent of their views.3. The Bishop is a man of the highest character, but his views are muddiedand no one can foretell what he may say when once he is in the United States.For my own point of view, I should prefer that his journey did not take place.But the fact that his visit will have been banned by His Majesty&apos;s Government is bound to become known, and may cause controversies on both sides of the Atlantic.4. The Bishop of Chichester is not only one of the senior bishops of theChurch of England but also a legislator. While I am very willing to take allresponsibility for refusing the facilities for which he asks, I think that before i do so I ought to obtain the concurrence of my colleagues.B. B.Ministry of Information, 18th January, 1945.[29061]
