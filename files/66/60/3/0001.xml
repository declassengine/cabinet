THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJ,ESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT------------  - ,Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 753.19th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT AND WELFARE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN my paper circulated as W.P. (44) 643, I made proposals for the extensionof the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1940 and an increase in thefinancial provision therein. &apos; These proposals were discussed at a meeting ofthe War Cabinet on the 21st November (W.M. (44) 152nd Conclusions), when thedifficulties of accepting the full financial liabilities involved in my proposals werepointed out, and a suggestion was made for an alternative scheme which would get over the difficulty of the present arrangement under which the amount ofthe sum nominally available each year, which is not actually spent, lapsescompletely.2. I have now discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and reached agreement with him subject to confirmation by the War Cabinet on the followingproposal. The Amending Act will authorise a total expenditure not exceeding 120,000.000 over the ten-year period commencing the 1st April, 1946, subjectto the actual expenditure under the Act in any one financial year not exceeding 17,500,000. The global figure of  120,000,000 will be inclusive of expenditureon research at present separately provided for and of expenditure on higher education which is in contemplation. In order to preserve the principle containedin the present Act, there will be no limit of time on research expenditure,but after the expiry of the ten-year period (and on the assumption that no further extension is made in due course), research expenditure will be limited to  1,000,000per annum.3. These proposals compare with my original suggestion of  150,000,000in all, made up of  10,000,000 per annum for the first three years,  15,000,000per annum for the next four, and  20,000,000 per annum for the last three.The greater elasticity of the new scheme will partly compensate for the smallerglobal figure provided, and under it I should.feel able to proceed with compre-hensive and intelligent planning of development programmes for the colonial territories. I believe, however, that it is the minimum provision on the basisof which such comprehensive planning is possible.O. S.Colonial Office,19th December, 1944.[28870]
