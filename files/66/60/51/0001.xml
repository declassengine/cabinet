THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET. /        Copy No. QW.p. (45) 34.12th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE ASSUMED DATE OF THE END OF THE WAR WITHGERMANY.Memorandum by the Minister of Production..THE proposals put forward for the aircraft programme in W.P. (45) 32 are closely tied to the assumption about the end of the German war.2. For various reasons it is necessary that we should now generally review the situation.   This note deals with thi-ee aspects : -(a) Is it desirable to change the assumption that the war will end bv themiddle of 1945 ?(&amp;) What would be the effect of a change upon munitions programmes ?(c) What consultation should there be with the American authorities about; our assumptions ?Should the assumption be changed?3. Our present production planning is governed by the instruction that departments should cover the requirements which would arise if the german war were to continue until the middle of 1945. In certain cases (such asammunition and tanks) decisions have recently been taken to increase production to levels which, if maintained, should cover our needs even if the German warcontinues after the 30th June. Before decisions are made on the aircraft programme, I think it is desirable that the War Cabinet and the Chiefs of staff should consider whether a later assumption is not now advisable. From the pointof view of production Departments, I think the choice lies between confirmingthe present assumption and extending it until the end of 1945. A still laterassumption might involve us in a waste of resources. An intermediate assump-tion would not make sufficient difference for it to be justified.What would be the effect of a change in the assumption?4. The programme mainly affected is that for aircraft. The programmeproposed (as does to a lesser extent the present operative programme) involves asubstantial reduction in the total production of aircraft in the second half of1945 compared with the present levels. If existing decisions about Service intakefor the first half of the year still stand, we are, I suppose, faced .with thenecessity of reducing our R.A.F. squadron strength (but not naval air squadrons)in the second half of 1945. But it appears probable that, with certain modifica-tions, the present operative aircraft programme will in total provide sufficientaircraft for our needs up to the end of 1945.5.   Admiralty programmes, including the Naval aircraft programme, are largely independent of any assumption about the end of the German war, though they might be affected if this assumption were coupled with a need to prepare. against a more effective U-boat campaign.6. In certain cases, such as ammunition and tanks, the Ministry of Supplyplans which have now been authorised would cover the continued needs of theArmy until the end of 1945. But in many other cases increases of productionabove present planning would probably be necessary if the later assumption is accepted. These increases may well include items such as standard clothing aswell as munitions proper; it will manifestly be desirable to maintain production[29044]
of items such as tropical clothing, &amp;c, to the extent necessary to cover our needsshould it prove possible to despatch during 1945 certain formations from theWestern to the Eastern theatre.7. It is not possible to say what the effect of the programme changesreferred to above would be upon man-power in the first half of 1945. I should expect to find that there were still some net releases from the munitions industriesover and above those necessary to replace wastage and call-up in industries as awhole. But the expansion in the non-munitions part of Group I industries andin Group II and Group III would certainly be much less than the 400,000 whichwas the estimate for the first half of the year on the current assumption.Consultation with the Americans.8. For the purposes of the Lease/Lend Budget for the next financial year(mid-1945 to mid-i946) the F.E.A. have asked us to submit our non-munitionsprogrammes (materials, food, oil, shipping, &amp;c.) on the assumption that theGerman war continues indefinitely and so for at least the whole of this period.This is the declared American policy on production, though it is not clear thatit is based upon an assumption made by the United States Chiefs of Staff. we know that this extreme swing is an attempt to correct the previous trend towardsreconversion.9. Although it would seem inconsistent to plan production of munitions onthe assumption that the German war ends in December 1945 and to submitrequests to F.E.A. for non-munitions on the assumption that the war continuesindefinitely, the inconsistency is more apparent than real, since supplies of food,for example, are much less affected by an assumed date than munitions. TheDepartments concerned with non-munitions will be able to give the requiredestimates. Even on the December assumption we should probably have to startimporting steel again from America. This we should pay for to maintain our export freedom.10. As soon as it is decided what assumption should govern our plans for home production, I should propose to inform the American authorities concerned of the basis on which we are operating and to explain why we did not feel ableto adopt the same basis as they did. Briefly, these reasons are that with the inevitable limitations of man-power, both for the Services and for industry, wemust, as in the past, continue to plan our limited resources to secure maximumeffect in the fairly near future. Just as at the beginning of 1944 we planned formaximum impact in that year, so at the present time we are planning formaximum impact in 1945.11. In conclusion, I ask that a decision should be reached whether we should now in all bur plans cover the possibility of the German war lasting until theend of 1945.(Initialled) O. L.Ministry of Production. S.W. 1,12th January, 1945.
