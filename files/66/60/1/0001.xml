If is issued for the personal use of......TOP SECRET Copy No.W.P. (44) 751.19th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.INTAKES TO THE ARMED FORCES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHSOF 1945.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT the request of the Prime Minister, the Ministerial Committee on Man-power is reviewing the man-power situation in the first half of 1945 in the lightof the Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (44)718) and the demands made by the Service^ and other Ministers. The Committeehave been asked to proceed on the assumption that the German war will continue until the end of June, 1945.2. This Memorandum is confined to making proposals for allocations tothe Armed Forces, which must be decided as a matter of urgency in order toenable the Minister of Labour and National Service to arrange the call-up andthe Service Ministers to plan ahead. Meanwhile, the Committee are continuing their review of allocations to industry.New Intakes Men.3. The claims for new intakes of men put forward by the Service ministers for the first half of 1945 are as follows : Royal Navy...............      27,000Army..........      .........     181,500R.A.F. ............      ... nil total     ...............     208,5004. By the end of 1944- each of the three Services will have received intakesin excess of their allocations for that year. In putting forward the figures inparagraph 3 the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Airtook no account of any excess intakes. Accordingly the requirement of the royal navy for the first six months of 1945 must be reduced to the extent of any suchsurplus, while the R.A.F. should be able to release men on this account. the requirement for the Army does take account of an additional 26,000 men received in 1944, and it is partly on this account that the Secretary of State for War hopesby internal reorganisation to hold the Army in the first six months of 1945 atthe level reached by the end of 1944, apart from any new intakes to be received in the first six months of 1945.* These are given in the following Memoranda : (i) Memoranda by the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (44) 724 and 729).&apos;(ii) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 705).(hi) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (44) 728).[28857]
5. The following are the bases of the requirements put forward by theService Ministers :-Royal Navy-The First Lord of the Admiralty states that the net require-ment of men and women during the first six months of 1945 to meet the present commitments of the Navy is 71,750. By imposing arbitrary cuts, he hopes toprovide 41,750. of this requirement from within existing Niaval strengths. The,requirement of 27,000 men (to which must be added 3,000 women, see paragraph 11below) represents additional numbers of specialised and technical ratings who cannot be found by internal reorganisation.Army. As stated in paragraph 4, the end-1944 strength of the Army willin any ease be maintained during the first half of 1945. The requirement of181,500 men arises on the following counts :- (a) 25,000 men in order to make possible a rapid and efficient re-deploymentagainst Japan at the end of June.(b) 23,000 men to replace battle casualties in the Far East in the second halfof 1945. The men for this must be embodied in the first half of theyear so that they will be trained by the time the need to replacecasualties arises.(c) 25,000 men to provide a pool of trained replacements so as to allow mento be released from the Army under Class B of the demobilisationscheme.(d) 40,500 men to replace normal wastage in the second half of 1945.(e) 18,000 men to enable the leave scheme for overseas theatres to continue in operation in the second half of 1945.(/) 50,000 men to continue the acceleration of the scheme for reducing thelength of tour overseas during the second half of 1945. (The opera-tion of the scheme in the first half of 1945 will depend upon transfers of basically trained men from the other two Services see paragraph below.)Royal Air Force. The Secretary of State for Air makes no newdemands, but expects by internal reorganisation to be able to carry through there-deployment against Japan at the end of the German war.6. Against the total demands of 208,500 men, the maximum supply whichcan be made available -excluding such drastic measures to call up young menfrom the munitions and other essential industries as would cause serious location is 140,000 men. This includes 20,000 fit young men who will be released from the munitions industries as a result of cuts in the programmes ofthe Supply Departments. The calling up of these men will mean that civilianindustry will have to forgo some expansion which would otherwise have been effected. This expansion would, however, be only temporary because, under thereallocation scheme after the end of the German war, these men will, in any case,be called up for service with the Forces. &quot;We consider that the value of theirearly availability to the Armed Forces as trained men outweighs the advantageof a temporary easement to industry, and therefore recommend that they shouldbe called up during the first half of 1945. To the 140,000 men who can be madeavailable for calling up in the first half of 1945 there must be added any menreceived by the Royal Navy in excess of their allocation for 1944.7. We have&apos; considered, in consultation with the Service Ministers, the division of this 140,000 men between the Royal Navy and the Army. Our view is that the maximum number possible should be provided for the Army, in orderto make available the pool of trained men which the Army will need if delay indeployment against Japan is to be avoided, if some progress is to be made in reducing the tour of service overseas, and if the&apos; maximum number of long-servicemen are to be demobilised as quickly as possible at the end of the German war.We consider that the needs of the Navy should be met with an allocation of20,000 men, of whom some will have already been received in 1944. This will leave for the Army 120,000 men, plus any men not required to meet the Navyallocation of 20,000, against the requirement of 181,500 put forward by theSecretary of State for War.Transfers to the Army from the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force.8. The Secretary of State for War has asked for a transfer of 70,000basically trained men from the other two Services in the first six months^ of 1945.Of these, 10,000 are required in order to complete the first two divisions needed
Total      ...............       16,800If the present age limits (from 17% to 19 years) for volunteers for the Women&apos;auxiliary Services are maintained, then the number of women who can be suppliedwill be only 10,000. If, however, the ban on volunteering which applies to womenover 19 years old is raised, then some of the women who will be released from the munitions industries in the first six months of 1945 will prefer to volunteer forthe Auxiliary Services rather than be directed into non-munitions work. Werecommend that this step should now be taken. While it is impossible to makeany precise estimate of numbers, we assume that about 5,000 additional womenwill be made available by this means, giving a total available for allocation of15,000.   These should be allocated as follows : Royal Navy...............        3,000Army...................       12,000R.A.F, ............... nil total     ......      .........      15,00012.   Our recommendations can be summarised as follows : -(i) The call-up of men to the Armed Forces should include 20,000 youngmen to be released from the munitions industries, so as to give a total supply of 140,000.(ii) The upper age limit on women volunteers for the Women&apos;s auxiliary services should be removed,(iii) Allocations of new intakes to the Services during the first half of 1945should be as follows :  Men. Women.Royal Navy.........        20,000* 3,000Army       ,...........       120,000f 12,000R.A.F,     ...      ...      ....      ... nil .     nil total&apos;...      ...      ...      ...      140,000 15,000* Less any men received by the royal navy in 1944 in excess of their allocation,f Plus any men not required to meet the Navy allocation of 20,000.for the Far East after the defeat of Germany. The other 60,000 are needed inorder to allow the Python scheme for the reduction of the tour of service over-seas to be accelerated in the early months of the year.9. The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air havemade the following offers : &apos;(a) From the Royal Navy : 11,868 men in formed units of the Royal Marinesto be made available on loan to the Army, and to be maintained byreplacements from the Royal Marines.&apos; The First Lord points outthat this must retard the further deployment of naval forces to foreignstations.(b) From the Royal Air Force : 5,000 men to be released from the R.A.F.Regiment. The majority of these, however, are likely to be of lowmedical category. In addition, about 2,000 aircrew may be madeavailable in the second quarter of the year.10. We do not consider that it will be possible to effect in the six monthstransfers on the scale desired by the Secretary of State for War. On the otherhand, we consider that both the Royal Navy and the R.A.F. should be able to makea greater contribution to the needs of the Army than has been offered. we accordingly recommend that the Royal Navy should transfer 20,000 men to theArmy, including the 11,868 men, to be maintained in formed units, offered by theFirst Lord. The Royal Air Force should also transfer 20,000 men to the Army,mainly of high medical category, and, in addition, should release to the Army afurther number equivalent to the excess intake over allocation which the R.A.F.has received in 1944.New Intakes Women.11. The Service Ministers put forward the following requirements forintakes of women to the Auxiliary Services in the first half of 1945 : Royal Navy................        3,000Army..................      13,800RA.F.............      ... nil
(iv) The following transfers should be made to the Army : 1Men.From the Royal Navy      ...      ...      ..;      ....      20,000From the RAF..........      ...     &quot;:..*&quot;    20,000$Total     ............     &quot;.......      40,000$$ Plus any excess of intake over allocation received by the B.A.F. in 1944.The transfer from the Royal Navy to include 11,868 men in formedunits of the Royal Marines.The transfer from the R.A.F. to contain a high proportion of menof high medical category.(v) The net position in men in the three Services, set against their require-ments, would be as follows (no allowance is made for excess intakesin 1944 not already allowed for in the requirements, the effect of whichwill be somewhat to increase intakes and transfers to the Army) : Royal Navy.
