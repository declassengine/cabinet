THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945. J. &amp; *aSECRET. Copy No.    3 6W.P. (45) 13.5th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.YUGOSLAVIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.KING PETER&apos;S letter to the Prime Minister of the 29th December(W.P. (45) 4) contains a fair statement of the criticisms which can reasonably be levelled at the agreement from his point of view.2. Although these criticisms are well argued, they are irrelevant to themain problem and do not take into consideration the realities of the situation.It is useless to argue the theoretical rights and wrongs of the Subasic-Tito agree-ment as viewed in the light of the Yugoslav Constitution and the King&apos;sprerogatives. The crude reality of the situation is that Tito is in possession of yugoslavia; and that it depends entirely upon him and his party whether ornot a monarchy shall be restored within the framework of his regime. If Titodecides to restore it, then a plebiscite or a Constituent Assembly will no doubtconfirm it. If, on the other hand, Tito does not wish to restore it, no amount ofassurances or undertakings regarding the plebiscite or the Constituent assembly will prevent there being a pronouncement against the monarchy. The King&apos;future prospects depend entirely upon Tito&apos;s goodwill, and in order to obtainthat goodwill he must accept the present agreement.3. Thus, the acceptance of the agreement as it now stands is the King&apos;sbest chance of preserving the monarchy and his own position. He can safeguardhis position in the eyes of the world by making it clear in a declaration that heaccepts the assurances given in the agreement in the sincere and honest hope thatthey will be fulfilled so as to enable his people to make a free and democraticchoice, of their future Government, and that in accepting them in this spirithe hopes to make his best contribution to the welfare of his people and State and carry out his responsibilities towards them.4. There should be no further delay in reaching a solution. Several weekshave now elapsed since Dr. Subasic returned to this country, and Tito is showingrestiveness at the continued delay. Unless King Peter makes up his mind soon,Tito will lose interest in the agreement and set up his own Government, excludingKing Peter, Dr. Subasic and the Yugoslav Government here.5. It is proposed, therefore, that the Prime Minister and I should, withthe War Cabinet&apos;s approval, see King Peter immediately and urge upon him thedesirability in his own interests and those of his country as a whole of accepting the agreement forthwith.6. The United States Government have previously shown no inclination to commit themselves by giving full approval to our policy, but they have not goneso far as to disapprove it in any respect. A telegram is therefore being sent to washington, informing them that we intend to press King Peter to accept theTito-Subasic Agreement and expressing the hope that this will meet with theUnited States Governments approval.A. E.Foreign Office, 5th January, 1945.12624 [28977]
