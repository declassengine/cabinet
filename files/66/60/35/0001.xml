(45) 18.10 &amp; January, 1945.WAR CABINET.GERMAN REACTIONS TO DEFEAT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State eor Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues a paper on &quot;German Reactions to Defeat.&quot;2. This study of the German mentality and its possible development in thefuture has been prepared by a member of the Foreign Office who knows Germanywell. Any paper on so speculative a subject must be controversial, and I am notmyself in agreement with all its conclusions; in particular I am not convincedthat Germany will necessarily turn East rather than West, though the danger ofthis admittedly exists.3. Clarity of mind and strength of will in this country will be of more importance in maintaining our security against Germany than any development in that country&apos;s own mind or will. For some time after her defeat we may, ifwe wish, be able largely to ignore what Germany thinks and feels. But we shallbe able to do so less and less as time passes; and I hope therefore that this papermay serve as a useful estimate of one factor in the mosf crucial of our long-term problems.A. E.Foreign Office, 10th January, 1945.ANNEX.WHEN Germany has been beaten we shall find there a surprising chaos ofideas and beliefs, of political and personal aims. National faith will be dormant;the idea of the Reich will seem dead. Germans will express, and even feel, the wish that their country, or their part of it, should become a British Dominion,or a Republic of the Soviet Union. Bavarians will denounce Prussians, SaxonsSilesians, Rhinelanders the rest. Few Germans, indeed, will profess any loyalty to Hitler or the Nazi faith; and, indeed, few at that time will have any. Nonation in the world will have better cause to revile Hitler than the Germans; for of all the nations he will have laid low, he will have laid the German nationlowest. Thousands of Germans will wish only to leave their country, to forgetit and its traditions for ever, and to emigrate to Australia or the Argentine, to china or Peru. There will probably be a strong religious revival; and there willbe devotees, too, for creeds that never were German, like pacifism, or that have long ceased to have any real meaning in Germany, like Monarchy. One sect weare unlikely to find. If Germans become anarchists, something will reallv have happened.2. We shall be wise not to pay too much attention to these transientsymptoms.  They will be symptoms of a disease, but not, probably, of a fatal one.12618   [28938]     &apos; b
Yet this disease will inflict, while it lasts, almost unparalleled sufferings on the patient, and it will last some time. The reactions outlined above will have acommon cause : the desire of Germans to escape from, to alleviate or to forgettheir pain.3. This pain will result from the collapse of the standard of life. It willbe the simple, physical pain of acute need. Rations, low for more than five years,&apos; will certainly get much lower. Houses Avill be harder to come by than in anycivilised country ever before. Clothes will be threadbare and irreplaceable.Fuel will be scarce. Transport will be chaotic. Personal property of every kindwill have worn out, or have disintegrated in the destruction of cities. Rawmaterials will be lacking, and manufactured goods for civil consumption will therefore be short. Employment may be intermittent, and its real reward will be small. Vitality, in a country which may well have suffered greater proportionatewar casualties than any Great Power in any previous war, will be low. And towar casualties may be added those removed to the &quot; Siberian Captivity,&quot; whichthe Germans already so much dread.4. This will be the crisis which will face individual Germans. In contem-contemplation of it they may, for a long time, overlook the more permanent injuries thewar will have inflicted on their country. The German army may have been abolished and German heavy industry destroyed or curtailed; but German townswill be no more and no less in ruins for that. Germany may have been truncated. or dismembered, but the same bread queue will stand before the same shop in thesame German town. If Germany loses all territory east of the Oder, and if allGermans from such territory and from the Sudetenland are transferred back toGermany, then for every sixty Germans there were in the queue before there will now be ten more; but for a time the sixty may well hate the intruding transfereesmore than the act of transfer.5. A soldier who loses a leg suffers from shock; he craves for hot tea, acigarette and warm blankets. Only when he feels better does he begin to misshis leg. Germany after this war will suffer from national shock, and will search for palliatives of many kinds. When she begins to recover-as no doubt, someway behind the rest of the world, she will she will begin to miss what she has lost. It is her reaction in this stage, rather than the acute symptoms of herprostration, that we should seek now to forecast and to study.6. One symptom of the early stage should, however, be considered : regionalfeelings of aversion on the part of one set of Germans for another, and the1&apos; separatist &apos;&apos; movements to which they may give rise. Local feelings always have been, and still are, strong in Germany. Bavarians, on the whole, really dodislike Prussians a good deal more than, say, Scots dislike Englishmen. ButBavarians do not, and in the long run will not, desire to cease being Germancitizens any more than Scots desire to. cease being British subjects. Theaccentuation of such feelings in the post-defeat period, and the &quot;separatist&quot;movements they may give rise to, will have two causes. First, the search forscapegoats, of which no doubt Germans will discover plenty; second, the desire of a regionally defined number of Germans to ingratiate themselves with thevictors, and thereby to secure advantages for their region over other parts ofGermany. But the history of separatist movements after the last war, both inthe Rhineland and Bavaria, suggests it is unlikely that they will become, still less remain, strong after this war. Far fewer Germans exist now than in 1918to whom Baden, Saxony or even Prussia mean, or could be made to mean, anythingcomparable to what Germany has meant. Particularist feelings will be genuineenough, perhaps, to produce lasting support for a certain measure of. decentralisation and local autonomy, which might be of some limited advantage- to us; but not genuine enough to welcome real independence and exclusion fromthe rest of Germany. These feelings will vary in intensity with the intensity ofthe moral and economic crisis of Germany. As that crisis diminishes, so willparticularist feelings.7. When Germany begins to recover her breath, various factors will help to form the climate of German opinion. There will be factors of tradition andhistory; factors of recent experience *tne experience of Nazism, t)he experience )of war and defeat, and the experience of the settlement (whatever it be-imposed upon Germany. There will be such special factors as the existence inGermany of almost a generation all Germans, more or less, born between 1910and 1930 which National Socialism has benighted and depraved. All these factors must be considered.   But there will be one special factor, which did not
exist in 1918, with which an intelligent German should in the future reckon,and on which we may base some hope.8. After this war Germany will find that she has ceased, for the first time since 1870, to be potentially the strongest military Power on the Continent ofEurope. For 75 years she held that position, and in the last 30 of those yearsthrew away, by repeated and extraordinary folly, the great advantages she hadalready derived and might have continued to derive from it. Already before this war the Nazis guessed that this position might be slipping away from them.That is the &quot; geo-political &quot; justification for their attack on Russia; they hoped to strike Russia down before the balance tipped in her favour. They failed, andthe balance has changed. Symptoms of the change are the reasonable estimates that German population will not increase after 1955, whereas Russianpopulation will continue.to increase rapidly till well on into the next century;and that by 1970 there will be, for every male German aged 20 to 34, four maleRussians of similar age.9. It must, of course, be realised that a similar decline in population, andtherefore (neglecting for the moment other factors) in potential military power,will affect other countries of Western Europe. But the change in Germany&apos;sstatus in relation to that of Russia is likely to be sufficiently evident for one greatfact to penetrate deeply and permanently into the German consciousness : thatGermany will never again be able to challenge the whole world alone. Yet thedeepest realisation of this fact will not be enough, by itself, to keep Germany outof mischief. If it were, we might be able to relax our vigilance. But even if germany alone be unable again to challenge the world, she could yet challengeit with a powerful partner or combination of partners. This may change thecharacter of the alliances she will seek, or even her sincerity in upholding them.She will want, perhaps, genuine partners, not mere jackals of opportunity. Butthis need not diminish her influence. Indeed, her diplomatic, as opposed to her military, influence may actually be increased. For if she ceases in Europeanpolitics to be the factor of decision, she may become the main factor ofequilibrium; thus acquiring opportunities of manoeuvre which she will knowhow to exploit. Germany&apos;s position in Europe after this war will perhaps becomparable when she has recovered from the crisis of defeat&apos; to that of thiscountry at the beginning of this century, when we woke up to the fact that weneeded allies, and proceeded to find them in Japan and in France. That we hadnot then reached the end of our power and success is sufficiently shown by thefact that we have since been among the victors in two world wars.10. This train of thought leads straight to a critical question : willGermany seek to turn her back on the West and link her fortunes with theEast? Before attempting to ianswer this, it will be better to continue the examination of the various psychological factors referred to above, which will themselves be of considerable importance in determining Germany&apos;s own answer to this question.11. What impression will the colossal experience of this war leave on the mind of the German people, and what lessons will they draw from it ? No doubt,when it is over and lost, the first reaction will be : Never again. But undoubtedlywar is the logical, even if sometimes undesired, expression of certain deep andhitherto abiding instincts and habits of the German people; and it would be rashto assume that even a second defeat in less than 30 years will by itself changethose instincts and those habits. In particular it is dangerous to believe thatthe mere fact that this war has entailed unprecedented destruction in Germany,and savage fighting on German soil, will by itself make it unlikely that germany will ever venture to indulge in war again. To be sure, some lively recollectionswill remain in the minds of individual Germans, and what they have sufferedat home will make them dread war more. But unless as a people they become less docile, and therefore less slavishly subordinate to the power of their State;unless as individuals they become more individualistic, more responsible, morerebellious, and therefore less prone to see in order and discipline the properconduct of life; then their mere passive preference for peace rather than warneed not inhibit the policy of the German State. It did not in 1939. their leaders wanted war, and they followed their leaders. If once again their leaderswant war which means if they see a good chance of waging it with success then the whole experience of this war, the destruction in Germany of so many[28938] b 2
towns and homes and lives, may indeed make the average German march offonce more with a heavier and more foreboding heart, but not less fast or far.12. Moreover, future German recollections of this war will not all be tingedwith defeat and disaster. Just as vividly they will remember how near they came to victory. They will remember the battles they won, the countries they struckdown, the heroes who led them in success or perished in the hour of seemingtriumph. The comradeship of an army, even a defeated and disbanded one,becomes when recollected in tranquillity a potent political factor. Those who take part in great campaigns, and survive them, remember them more rosily asthey grow more remote; and this may prove as true of civilian battlefields Coventry or Essen, London or Berlin as of military ones. Nothing will&apos;stop the Germans from believing they had the finest army in the world, and succumbedonly to superiority in numbers and material. Nothing wall stop them takingpride in their accomplishments in a pursuit at which they so manifestly excel.Nothing, finally, will stop them wishing to re-create armed forces when they havebeen deprived of them. This is the chief argument for not allowing them to doso; it is an argument against supposing that defeat can by itself eradicateGerman militarism. The lesson we must try to teach the Germans is not that war does not pay, or that war is futile or ignoble. The lesson must rather be that war can never pay them. We must so condition the evolution of Germany thatthe claws of militarism become rudimentary, and finally drop off. We must leave them no alternative to peace. Then, by necessity, they may become as peacefulas the Swiss. And let us remember that if there were 70,000,000 Swiss theymight not be so peaceful after all.13. Four factors lie at the root of German militarism. The first is history,and that we cannot change. Germany became great by force of arms, and will always suspect that she might repeat the process. The second is opportunity.In 1864, 1866 and 1870 Germany had the opportunity to profit by war; in 1914and 1939-she thought she had. This, the most important factor of all, can be changed : Germany must be given no reason to hope she will ever have suchan opportunity again. The third is discipline, by which is meant the instinctto organise and to obey, to exercise and to submit to authority. This we cannot,and events probably will not, much change. In Germany this instinct is carriedto excess; and the reactions of defeat will certainly in the short run, and possibly even permanently, diminish its force. But it is not in itself a pernicious instinct,and it is of great value in other fields than war. In the case of Germany it ismade pernicious by the fourth factor. This is that specifically German quality,so hard to define, so impossible to overlook, to analyse which so many books havebeen written. It is the highest common factor, and too high at that, of centuriesof German poetry and philosophy; the dark, ecstatic and irrational element inGerman thought and conduct. Nothing is more rational than discipline; but nothing more irrational, by Western standards, than the German conceptionthat the highest freedom can reside in subjection to it. It is this fatal idealismthat has led in Germany to the eclipse of the individual and the cult of thecommunity, to the aberrations of racial superiority and leader-worship, to thecult of brutality as necessary to the complete denial of the value of the humanpersonality, a denial on which this idealism insists. It is this idealism which gives to German militarism its monstrous quality, and has made the Nazi abroadthe missionary of a daemonic cult. Will defeat change this? There is a chance that it may. The terrible, sobering effort of reconstruction, adjustment andatonement will purge away much of the infection; and it may be that, in theantiseptic atmosphere of prolonged national impotence, the canker will witheraway.   But we cannot be sure.14. The experience of National Socialism may prove to have been more -salutary to Germany than the experience of war and defeat. National Socialismwill end in colossal failure. Here, again, it is possible that Germans will remember the nearness of success rather than the eventual disaster. But it is less likely than in the case of militarism. They will attribute such success asthey had more to their natural qualities as Germans than to the superficial (asthey will regard them) attributes of National Socialism, and, indeed, in theseattributes, and the leaders who incarnated them, will be found one of the mostpopular scapegoats for defeat. The legend of Hitler&apos;s genius will be hard put to it to survive intact the proofs of his military incapacity, which, when oncehe is out of the way, most Germans, and first of ail the surviving military leaders,will be at pains to underline.   This is fortunate for us, as a dead Hitler, without
this handicap, might prove a powerful idol in years to come. As it is, there isprobably no good reason for the more extreme fears sometimes expressed that the nazi system as such will prove ineradicable in Germany, or that the legend ofits leaders will keep alive or rekindle its doctrines. National Socialism will suffer,in German eyes, from the supreme demerit of having failed. Its end will bring to almost all Germans relief from certain restrictions or obligations that theyhave disliked. The immediate reaction against its principles, its methods andits personalities will be violent, and may become more so as Germans learn more tthan many of them now know about its real nature. National Socialism has been no more than a special form of organisation of the instincts and capacities ofthe German people. Other forms of totalitarian organisation almost equallyunpleasant and effective may occur, for these instincts and capacities will remainlargely what they are. But there is little reason to fear that National Socialismitself will revive; and some reason to hope that the experience of it will havetaught the Germans a few lessons which they will not forget. It would besuperficial to regard Hitlerism as likely to remain a menace of the same order asGerman nationalism and German militarism. These two evils may unite againunder a new totalitarian cloak; but it is not likely to be one of national socialist cut.15. To this analysis two important qualifications must, however, be made.The first concerns the &quot; lost generation,&quot; brought up to know no ideals and nocareer save those offered, no facts and no theories save those permitted, by national Socialism. Some even of these, maybe, will yet contrive to work their passage home to more normal ways of living. But many will no more be able to live out of the atmosphere of National Socialism than a snail can out of its shell.Were there but few of them, policemen and psychiatrists might suffice to solve the problem : but there will be many. It is vain to hope that men such as the worst of these can be &quot; re-educated.&quot; Only drastic and severe remedies, such asprolonged internment or deportation or long labour service outside Germany inthe reconstruction of devastated countries, hold out any hope of working them out of Germany&apos;s system. In her convalescence Germany, after injection withother ideas, may be immune from their contagion; but both Germany and europe will need protection from their violence.16.   The second qualification is of more importance.   To say that NationalSocialism is unlikely to remain, or to become again, a popular creed in Germanydoes not mean that Germany is likely to become democratic.   Germany will once again have the choice or so it might seem between the ideals of the west and of the East, between an individualist and a collectivist system.   Unfor-unfortunately, there can be little doubt what her choice will be.   Many Germanindividuals, and perhaps even the majority in some districts of Germany Baden,the Rhineland, the Hanseatic cities- may understand and prefer the Westerntradition of individual freedom and the concept of the State as the servant, notthe master, of its citizens.   But even they have long regarded this system withnostalgia, as something unobtainable, impracticable and essentially unsuited toGermany, rather than with passion, as something to be fought for, acquired andjealously preserved.   To the great majority of Germans, on the other hand,persona,! liberty, the active rule of the majority, even the rule of law, have longseemed things not perhaps undesirable, but not important when weighed againstthe claims of the State to impose discipline, organisation and efficiency for itsown supreme ends.   In the last resort, Germans are not interested in politics.They do not think of the action of the State as being a reflection of their ownwills.   They prefer that it should circumscribe and define the limits withinwhich their individual wills may act. They are therefore, in the political sense,irresponsible : they reject the burden and duty of choice.   Thus there can beno hope for liberalism in Germany.   Liberals cannot force people not even tobe free.  But the German mass is determined to be forced.  It insists on abdication.And it will abdicate to the first party that presents it with an inviting strait-jacket.   It is probably vain to hope that National Socialism will have stimulatedcontrary desires by thwarting them.   It will rather have extinguished themaltogether.   We shall not find the individual reacting against the community; onthe contrary, we shall find that Germans cut adrift and turned into individualsby the collapse of one system, will look for another.   They will seek again the stability of a new community, the warmth of immersion in a new mass.   Whetherthe plunge goes left or right will matter, in the long run, comparatively little to us.None of the typically German patterns of thought and behaviour discussed above,which have flourished in a Fascist Germany, need be inhibited, or even much
altered, in a Communist one. But unless the West has more to offer Germanythan Germans at present believe, we must be prepared to find that NationalSocialism has confirmed and completed the trend of centuries, and that germany is lost, for good and all, to the Western world.17. An attempt may now be made to answer the question : would Germany,in another war&apos;crisis, be found on the side of the East or the West ? Circumstancescan alter any case. But if German inclinations and calculations are to determine* the matter, then the answer must be as pessimistic as most of the other conclusionsso far arrived at in this paper. Germany will be found on the side of the East,because her political and social ideas and instincts&quot; will align her with the Eastrather than the West. And this conclusion on grounds of psychology is reinforced by two practical reasons, of even greater importance, why Germany should lookEast rather than West. First, she will never again wish to try cone i. us ions withRussia : those who oppress the weak side with the strong. Second, Russia will,if she so chooses, be in a position, and the West will not, to restore to GermanyAvhat she will most passionately long to recover : the territory she is about to lose to Poland.18. The mere resentment of defeat and disarmament, quite apart from thefinal political, economic and territorial settlement imposed upon her, will be enough no doubt to inflame nationalist and militarist feelings in Germany. ButGermans do understand that lost wars involve losses; and they might accept and become resigned to a settlement which imposed on them heavy servitudes, includingterritorial losses up to a certain point. It is, however, a fact, simple andunoriginal but inescapable, that Germany&apos;s mental reaction to defeat will bedetermined, in the long run, not by the mere fact of defeat, but by the settlement-it leads to. It will be determined most of all by the territorial settlement, andby such possible accompanying burdens as the wholesale transfer of populationsfrom ceded areas, which would spread throughout the remainder of germany the unappeasable determination of irredentism and the bitterness of the dis-possessed. To exacerbate Germany&apos;s feelings of nationalism and militarismby inflicting on her very extensive territorial losses, which she will regard asunjust and intolerable and to which she will never become resigned, would gravelydiminish any hope there may be that Germany might eventually become reconciledto the settlement of Europe, and co-operate in its maintenance.19. The more it is outraged, the greater is the risk that the ideal of militantGermany will revive. It is an ideal dangerous to ourselves. If, beyond a certainnecessary point, we can let it alone, this dangerous ideal may die or be displaced.To displace it a new ideal will be needed, an alternative and harmless ideal. Itmust be one which can attract and employ the great capacities and the great skillof the German people; and it must give them a hope of satisfying that odd desireby which they have always been haunted the desire to be respected, admired andloved by the rest of the world. We -must, if possible, find an ideal that existsalready in Germany&apos;s traditions : and one such can be found. It is the ideal of social and intellectual progress. Germany must be encouraged to aim at being asuper-Sweden, cleaner, better planned and healthier than any State ever was before, with better social, medical and educational services and a higher standardof living than any State ever had. It is not a bad programme for a defeatedcountry; but even in such a programme there are dangers. We must keep an eyeon her philosophy, and still more, war being what it has become, on her science.But the alternative to some such sublimating alternative ideal is only the oldpernicious one, and can lead only to the old pernicious trouble : it is the ideal ofthe German people and the German nation. The excessive mutilation of germany by truncation, or her abolition by dismemberment, will lead only to the re-estab-lishment of the ideal of the German Reich. If we are confident that we shahretain the means and the will to resist its dangers, then let us by all means risk there-establishment of this ideal.   But not otherwise.20. And if we are to place before Germany the ideal of the social state, ofthe rising standard of life, then we should refrain, where possible, even in theearliest days of peace, from action which will make that ideal seem impossiblyfar off. Unemployment in Germany may prove as deadly to Europe as nationalpride. National Socialism found jobs for all; and whatever else the Germans mayforget about it, they will not forget that. The German people have great energy and great skill. If at first these cannot be employed to their own profit, at leastthey should be employed to the general profit of Europe.
21. If this analysis.has any lesson for us, it is perhaps that we should nothasten, in the artificial atmosphere and depression of a defeated country, to imposeservitudes, political or economic, that may later promote the rebirth of Germanmilitarism, at a time when we may be less disposed and perhaps less able to resistit. We should concentrate on what is necessary for our own security, rememberingthat the purpose of the peace, as of the war, is not to punish the Germans butto secure our own safety and advantage. We should also see to it that certainlessons are learnt by the Germans. They are : that Germany can never againchallenge the world alone; that the other Powers will never permit her to join oneof them in challenging the rest; and therefore that she must cease to mourn forher military past, or hope to recreate it, and see her future instead in terms of anew and different conception.Foreign Office, 2nd January, 1945.
