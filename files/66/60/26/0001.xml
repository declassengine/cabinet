(45) 9.5th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.POSTAL VOTING FOR THE FORCES, SEAMEN and war WORKERS ABROAD.Memorandum by the&quot; Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their meeting on the 4th December (W.M. (44) 161st Conclusions,Minute 11) the War Cabinet invited me to preside over a Conference to devise a scheme for postal voting for the Forces.2. There have been two meetings of the Conference, and I now submit, forthe consideration of the War Cabinet, their unanimous Report.3. I understand that, if the War Cabinet accept the scheme in the Report,it is contemplated that the amendments of the law required to give effect to itshould be made in the Representation of the People Bill, the Committee Stage ofwhich will be taken in the week beginning the 15th January. It will no doubt be desirable to publish the Report at the time when the amendments to the bill are put down.4. It will be observed that in paragraph 14 of the Report the Conferencerecommend that, in order to provide, postal voting facilities over the widest possible area, an additional period of nineteen days should be provided by post-postponing the opening of the count for this number of days after the poll. some members of the Conference urged that at least part of the additional time shouldbe provided by extending the interval between nomination and the poll. Theirreasons for this proposal were based on the view that, in general, it was desirable that there should be a longer period of active electioneering before theGeneral Election, and I accordingly felt that the proposal,- if it were to beadopted, would have to be adopted on other grounds, since it was not a necessaryfeature of the scheme for postal voting for the Forces. I undertook, however, tobring the point to the attention of my colleagues.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,5th January, 1945.[28967]

Report of the Conference on Postal Voting for theForces, Seamen and War Workers Abroad.1. As announced by the Home Secretary in the House of Comnionsthe 14th December-, 1944, the Conference was constituted to enquire into anreport upon the practicability of extending over as wide a geographical areas possible, a system of postal voting for members of the Forces, seanieoverseas and war workers abroad, on the assumption that the system wou]not be operated until the conclusion of hostilities in Europe and that a-extension of time for counting the votes of such persons would be necessar-The Conference included representatives of the main political parties, ftChief Party Agents and representatives of Electoral Registration and Returning Officers and of the Services and the Government Departments concerned the names of those who attended the meetings of the Conference are give in Appendix I.2.   The Conference considered the problem under four main heads:-(A) Registration.(B) Arrangements before the Election.(C) Arrangements at the Election.&quot;(D) Area of Postal Voting.The recommendations of the Conference under each head are set out iithe following paragraphs of the Report. The Conference also consider some miscellaneous points which are dealt with under head (E).&apos;6.   Although the Conference considered the problem  in relation toGeneral Election to be  held in 1945 after the coming into force of tliRegister to be published on the 7th May, the scheme which is recommendcould, in substance, be used for a General Election held in 1946 or latercould not, however, be used for bye-elections.(A) Registration.4.   Registration   is  a  necessary  preliminary  to  an election and tliConference recommend that the existing arrangements should be continueunder which members of the Forces,  seamen and war workers abroa(referred to collectively in this Report as  Service  voters) are given a!opportunity to apply to be registered for the constituency containing tlifaddress at which they would have been living but for their war service,these arrangements are continued, it is estimated by the Service Departments that, by the 15th March, 1945, the number of declarations inhands of Electoral&apos;Registration Officers from which the Service Itegistewill be compiled, will represent some 90 per cent, of the total numberopersons in the Services eligible to be registered.5. When a Service voter applies for registration, he is given a chanceappointing a proxy and the Conference were informed that a high proportioof applicants have done so. As indicated in paragraph 11, the appointmenof proxies is necessary in order to guard against the disfranchisementService voters who, because they are beyond the reach of postal votinfacilities, or for other reasons, are unable or unwilling to vote by post. TlConference accordingly recommend that proxy appointments already mudby Service voters should stand and that new applicants for registratioshould continue to be given an opportunity to appoint proxies.6.   To ensure that as many Service voters as possible are included the Register to be published on the 7th May, 1945, the Conference recommen
I i for these voters, the qualifying date should be the 15th March, 1945,- Vad of ta6 January&apos; which is the date proposed for civilians. A date&apos;Df, than the 15th March would not give enough time to enable the Serviceglisters to be compiled and printed for publication on the 7th May.(B) Arrangements before the Election.7 In order to operate a system of postal voting the Returning Officer forlCli constituency must be supplied before nomination day with the addressesI the Service voters registered for the constituency to whom postal ballotners must be sent. At present neither the Electoral Registration Officernoerned nor the Registrar General, who keeps the Central Index of service voters, is aware of the voter&apos;s Service address. They know only his namen(j Service number. Nor could the Service Departments easily or quickly&apos; ply the current addresses of the Service voters in a constituency, if they.6[.e (riven only the names and Service numbers of the voters. An applica-tion from the Service voter himself is thus required if the system of postalvoting is to work satisfactorily over as wide a geographical area as possible.I &apos;fi,c Conference therefore recommend that during the period beginning the31st March, 1945, Service voters who are stationed in areas declared to beiiostol voting areas (see paragraph 16) should be given an opportunity ofmaking an application for a postal ballot paper to be sent to them at anymineral election held after the 7th May, 1945. The application would givejjie address to which the postal ballot paper should be sent; and would bemade to the Electoral Registration Officer of the County or Borough (Burgh)containing the address at which, when he applied for registration, the Servicevoter declared that he would have been living but for his war service. Itnould be necessary for the application to be in the hands of the electoral registration Officer at least four days prior to nomination day.8. For the purpose of keeping up to date the information supplied toElectoral Registration Officers when Service voters apply for postal ballot papers, the Conference recommend that those who have so applied shouldbe encouraged, if they change their address, to notify the change on an appropriate form to the Electoral Registration Officer concerned; and that,as a further precaution, the Services should arrange for the speedyre-direction by the unit concerned of election material addressed to service voters who are no longer with the unit. The Conference also recommend, the Service Postal Authorities should see that communications relatinglo an election which are addressed to a Service voter who has moved withMs unit from one area to another without having notified a change of addressare delivered to him at his new station. The Conference had the assurance of the Service representatives that the obligations which these arrangementsinvolve would, so far as they were concerned, be carried out.9. To facilitate the rapid dispatch of the postal ballot papers at an election, and so to enable as wide a geographical area as possible to be covered by a system of postal voting, the Conference recommend that eachapplication for a postal ballot paper and each notification of a change ofaddress should be accompanied by an adhesive label upon which the voterwould write his full name, number and Service address. This label would beused by the Returning Officer in dispatching the envelope containing the postal ballot paper.10. The Conference consider that it is important that Service votersshould be kept as fully informed as possible about electoral matters relatingto their constituency. They recommend, therefore, that proxies should be advised to let the Service voters by whom they have been appointed know the
name of their constituency and the address of the Electoral Registrar IOfficer concerned; and to keep them posted about such matters as the choindof candidates for a general election.11.   The Conference are of opinion that it will be necessary to avoid tlclanger of Service voters being disfranchised because their postal ballot papei.are not delivered to them or because they are not returned in time to beincluded in the count.   They accordingly recommend that, notwithstaudmthe receipt by an Electoral Registration Officer of a claim for a postal ballolpaper, any appointment of a proxy made by the voter should remain alivThey also&apos;recommend that the fact that a voter has been sent a postal ballpaper should not be an obstacle to the recording of a vote at the same electionby his proxy, on the clear understanding that, if his postal vote is duly receivebefore the count, any proxy vote recorded on his behalf will be cancelledAny such arrangement involves the adoption of a novel procedure at the thugof the count in order to ensure that the proxy votes of those who have votedby post are cancelled.   An outline of the suggested procedure is attached tothis report as Appendix 11.(0) arrangements at the time of the election.12. The Conference recommend that the Returning Officer should dispatchto those who have applied for postal ballot papers not only the necessavjvoting documents but, if a candidate so desires, a copy of his election addvesfor the constituency. The largest envelope, of which the necessary supplyare obtainable, which can be handled by the Service Postal Authorities ;this stage is one measuring six inches by four inches. It is also essential-that the total load to be curried by air from this country to voters overseasshould be kept as low as possible. Apart from the election addresses of the candidates, the envelope must contain (a) the ballot paper,(b) the ballot paper envelope,(c) the declaration of identity which the Service voter must completewhen lie marks his ballot paper, and(d) a return envelope addressed to the appropriate Returning Officer.It is accordingly necessary to place some limitation on the size and weightof the remaining contents; and the Conference recommend that if a candidate desires that his election address should be sent by the Returning officer to Service voters he should be required to limit it to a size not greater than ten inches by seven and a half inches and to a weight not exceeding a quarterof an ounce.13.   The Conference recommend that, on the delivery of the postal ballot paper to the voter, he should be allowed a period of at least one clear clay iiwhich to read the election addresses, mark the ballot paper, and complete illdeclaration of identity.   Arrangements should be made by the Services tdensure that the ballot paper can be completed in secrecy; and each Servicdshould also consider the most suitable arrangements to be made to ensiirthat the voter who receives a ballot paper understands the instructions wliicHaccompany it as to the completion of the declaration of identity and tlisealing up and return of the ballot paper.14. The Conference were authorised to assume that an extension oftimifor counting the votes of Service voters would be necessary. The poll tab!place normally on the ninth day (excluding Sunday) after nomination, ancllin order to provide postal voting facilities over the widest possible area, thTConference recommend than an additional period of nineteen days should bej
Ilovved. Unless it were decided on other grounds to extend the period between nomination and the poll, the opening of the count would accordingly1,6 postponed for a period of nineteen days after the poll. This would allowtwenty-nine days in all for the dispatch of the ballot papers by the returning officers, their delivery to the voter, their completion by him and their returnto this country. Of this period three days would be required by the returning officer for the printing and dispatch of the ballot papers; and at least onefay for their completion by the voters.15. It will be noted that if the &quot;scheme set out in Appendix II is adopted-it will not be possible under the arrangements recommended to complete theMuni at a general election in a single day. The Conference accordingly recommend that the procedure connected with the count should be spreadover a period of two days as proposed in Appendix II. The effect of this willlie to delay the declaration of the result of the election for twenty-one days in all.(D) Area of Portal Voting.18. The Air Ministry have given an assurance that the necessary aircraft for the transport of the ballot papers will be available, and, on this basis, aperiod of twenty-nine days; between nomination and the opening of the countwould justify the provision of postal voting facilities for Service voters (otherijiiin those in isolated posts) serving in the following areas:  (1) Western Europe (B.L.A.). (10) Burma.(2) Gibraltar. (11) Ceylon.(3) North Africa (B.N.A.F.). (12) West Africa.(4) Italy (C.M.F.). (18) East Africa.(5) Egypt, Palestine, &amp;c. (M.E.F.). (14) South Africa.(6) Malta. (15) Canada.(7) The Azores. (16) United States.(8) Persia and Iraq (Paiforce). (17) Iceland.(9) India. &apos;la the preparation of this list, a margin of three days has been allowed for contingencies, bad weather, &amp;e.The Conference recommend that Service voters should be able to record a vote after the close of the poll in this country, provided that the ballot paper is received by the Returning Officer in time for inclusion in the count;:md the list of postal voting areas has been prepared on this footing.17. The Conference considered the alternative of postponing the countfor fourteen instead of nineteen days, giving a period of twenty-four daysbetween nomination and the count. In this period it would not be possible,on the assumptions made, to include (1) India, (4) Iceland.(2) Burma. (5) East Africa.(3) Ceylon. (6) South Africa.The Conference are therefore of the opinion that the postponement shouldbe for the longer period so that these areas may be covered. It will be notedthat they include Burma notwithstanding the fact that fighting may still bein progress there at the time of the election.IS. Whether the period between nomination and the count is twenty-four or twenty-nine days, it will be impossible to cover Australia and NewZealand; and there have also been excluded a number of areas for which,owing to their remoteness or to the small numbers of Service votersstationed in them, the provision of special facilities would be impracticableor unjustifiable.
19.   The Conference recommend that naval voters serving in stations on land in the postal voting areas, naval voters and seamen serving jn h.0niwaters, and, so far as possible, war workers in the postal voting areas abroadshould be included.(E) Miscellaneous.20. The Conference considered whether arrangements should be madeto enable Service voters to vote by post in respect of their business premisesor university qualification. The Conference recommend that such votersshould be enabled to vote by post on making a special claim for thepurpose.2.1. The Conference considered also the special position of prisonersof war. The Representation of the People Bill now before Parliamentincludes a provision (Clause 17) enabling prisoners of war to be registered ontheir own application up to the date of initiation of an election. TheConference are in general agreement with this proposal; and recommend thatthe applications of prisoners of war who had not applied for registration before their capture should be made immediately on their return to this country andshould be accepted if they are received at any time up to four days beforenomination.SUMMARY.22.   In summary, the scheme which the Conference unanimously recom-mend for adoption is (1) The present arrangements for the registration of Service voters andthe appointment of proxies should continue.  (Paragraphs 4 and 5.)(2) To ensure that as many Service voters as possible are registered,the qualifying date for the May Service Register should be theloth March, 1945.   (Paragraph &apos; 0.)(3) From the 31st March, 1945, Service voters in the postal voting areasset out in paragraph 16 should he given an opportunity of applyingfor postal ballot papers for a general election. The application should reach the appropriate Electoral Registration Officer at leastfour days before nomination.   (Paragraph 7.)(4) All possible steps should be taken to ensure that Service voters  ,receive postal ballot papers even if they change their unit ortransfer from one area to another.    (Paragraph 8.)(5) The voter should himself supply the address to which the ballot paper is to be sent.   (Paragraph 9.)(6) Proxies appointed by Service voters should be encouraged to keepthe Service voters informed about electoral matters in theirconstituency.   (Paragraph 10.)(7) In order to avoid the risk of disfranchisement, any proxyappointment made by a Service voter who applies for a postal ballot paper should stand, a proxy vote being cancelled if thevoter himself completes a postal ballot paper and returns it intime for inclusion in the count.   (Paragraph 11.)(8) On the occurrence of an election, the necessary voting documents and the election addresses of the candidates should be sent by the returning Officer by post to those who have applied for postal ballot papers. The size and weight of the election addresses shouldbe limited.   (Paragraph 12.)(9) The Services should make suitable arrangements to ensure that Ithe ballot papers can be completed in secrecy and that the service voters understand the instructions which accompany the ballot papers.   (Paragraph 13.)
(10) There should be an interval of nineteen days between the poll andthe opening of the count and the postal vote of the Service votershould be accepted if it is received before the opening of the count.(Paragraph 14.)n&apos;i) The count should be spread over two consecutive days. (Para-graph 15.)(12) Subject to any necessary adjustments, the arrangements should apply to seamen in home waters and war workers abroad; and special arrangements should be made for prisoners , of war and service voters with business premises or university qualifications.(Paragraphs 19 to 21.)On the basis of these recommendations the time-table for the variousoperations would be (if &quot; D &quot; is nomination day):  15th March.

The Returning Officer, when dispatching postal ballot papers to those whohave applied for them, should mark on the declaration of identity the voter&apos;s number in the Service Register, and note in that Register that a ballot paper has beendispatched. Neither the ballot paper nor the ballot paper envelope will bear anvevidence of the voter&apos;s identity.2. The issue of a ballot paper, if applied for, to a proxy appointed by a service Voter should be subject to special arrangements so as to facilitate&apos;itssubsequent identification and its cancellation if the foter has voted by post. the ballot paper should be of a special colour and should include a perforated stripon the right-hand side on which the number of the voter in the Service Registershould be marked by the Presiding Officer. The Register should also be markedto show that the proxy has voted.3. The comparison of the postal and proxy ballot papers should take placeon the two days immediately following the end of the period during which postal ballot papers may be received.4. On the first day the covering envelopes returned by postal voters should be opened. The declaration of identity, which will show the voter&apos;s number in theService Register, should he scrutinised and compared with the ballot paperenvelope; and a mark should be made in the Service Register to show that the postal ballot paper has been returned. The ballot papers themselves should thenbe placed in a ballot box to be dealt with in the ordinary way.5. The ballot boxes containing the proxy votes should then be opened and thetotal number of ballot papers ascertained. The specially coloured proxy papersshould be segregated and the others returned to the ballot boxes. The numberson the perforated strips forming part of the specially coloured papers should be checked by means of a call-over with the Service Register. Where the Registershows that a postal ballot paper has been returned by the same voter, the proxyvote should be cancelled and the specially coloured ballot paper should be set aside. Where the voter has not voted by post, the perforated strip showing theService Register number should be detached and the ballot paper placed in a ballot box.6. On the second day the count proper should take place in accordance with normal procedure. Xo ballot paper at this stage will give any clue to the identity of the voter.Wt. - i/45 F-O.P. 28967 Gp. 340
