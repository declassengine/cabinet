aTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 35.17th January, 1945.WAR CABINET.MIGRATION.Memorandum by the. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.SINCE the circulation of War Cabinet Paper W.P. (44) 571 by the Ministerof Labour and National Service and myself regarding departmental arrangementsfor the administration&apos; of post-war migration policy, representatives of myDepartment and of the Ministry have been in discussion with an Australianrepresentative for the working out of detailed plans for assisted migration inthe post-war period.As a result of these discussions two draft Agreements have been preparedfor submission to the two Governments for approval, and I think the War Cabinetmay like to see these documents now as an indication of the progress which wehave so far been able to make with Australia.It will be seen that these two documents* are respectively (a) a draft Agreement dealing with the facilities to be provided in australia in relation to ex-Service men and women for whom we have under-taken to provide free passages to Dominions on demobilisation if they so desire (this is based on the report of the interdepartmental committee on Oversea Settlement on Demobilisation which was approved by the Committee on&apos;Reconstruction Problems at their thirdmeeting held on the 11th February, 1943); and(b) a general Agreement for the post-war period covering a joint contribution by the two Governments for giving assistance in the cost of passagesto other approved migrants. This follows the general plan of similarassisted passage agreements which were in force before the war underthe Empire Settlement Act.These draft Agreements will require to be considered in detail by the variousinterested Departments here, and arrangements are being made for this to be doneforthwith. In the light of departmental views I hope to be able to make a furtherrecommendation at a later date to the War Cabinet as to the acceptance of theAgreements when the Australian Governments views upon the drafts are received.Government Free Passage Scheme for Ex-Servicemen and Women.Revised Draft  Memorandum  of Agreement  between  the   United KingdomGovernment and the Government of the commonwealth of Australia.1.
