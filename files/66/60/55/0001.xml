THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 38.2Qth January, 1945ORGANISATION OF CIVIL AVIATION.Memorandum by the Minister for Civil Aviation.FOLLOWING oh my paper W.P. (44) 585, I now put to my colleagues theplan which I propose for the organisation of British Civil Aviation.2. There are many reasons why the position is urgent; and why we must decide on our plan and be fully prepared to carry it out:(a) The United States are firmly established in South and Central Americaand are ready to start at once all over the world.(i) Their Air Lines organised and equipped.(ii) United States Air Transport Command is operating on a hugescale on almost all the trunk routes, staffed with many AirLine executives and officials, and ready to &apos;&apos; turn civil&apos;&apos; atany time.(iii) The United States Government is busily negotiating agreements with foreign countries and offering planes on generous terms.(iv) They may not even wait for the end of the German war, wherecountries are clear of the enemy.(&amp;) Though it has shown a distinct improvement under Lord Knollys&apos; chair-manship, B.O.A.C. is inadequate for its task. The. Company mustbe reorganised; and efficient organisations must be in being for allroutes.(c) Commonwealth countries are keen to start up.(d) In the United Kingdom we have no approved plan.  When the german war ends any Air Line Company would have a legal right to start up.(e) No policy for airfields in the United Kingdom can be settled till we havean aviation plan for the United Kingdom.   This affects sixty or moreMunicipalities and Town and Country Planning.(/) Parliamentary pressure for a plan.(g) I cannot undertake effective discussions with potential operators untilthe principles of a plan have been approved.(h) We shall lose our influence with foreign countries unless we are readyto go forward.3.   The following are the routes we must be prepared to operate :- (a) Empire (i) United Kingdom-India-Australia-New Zealand,(ii) United Kingdom-India.(iii) United Kingdom-Egypt-East Africa-Rhodesia-South Africa.(iv) Atlantic (a) United Kingdom-Canada.(&amp;) United Kingdom-United States.(v) United Kingdpm-West Africa and services in West Africa.(vi) Pacific. Australia-New Zealand-Fiji-San Francisco-Vancouver.(vii) Bermuda-Canada.Bermuda-United States.(viii) United Kingdom-West Indies and services in the Caribbean.[29060] copy No.IWAR CABINET.
(b) United Kingdom-South America.(c) United Kingdom-Egypt plus Iraq and Iran.(d) United Kingdom to all European countries.(e) Internal services in United Kingdom.4. The following are.. I submit, the prerequisites of an efficient organisation \for civil, air transport : (a) First-class knowledge and experience of transportation, passengers,freight, mail.(5) An efficient organisation covering every area served by the air lines to handle passengers, freight and mail.(c) Co-operation with other forms of transport.(d) Close co-operation between the user and the manufacturer in deciding the types of aircraft to be used.\e) Economical maintenance and pooling of aircraft.(/) Training, provision and welfare of air crews. This includes training offoreign air crews and ground staff, which United States are alreadyoffering.(g) Technical and operational help to foreign countries; very important insale of aircraft, and good relations along our trunk routes.(h) Units must be large enough to operate economically, but not too large orwidespread to give individual supervision all along every route.(i) Initiative and pooling of experience.5.. The prerequisites in 4 can only be obtained by drawing on the experience and personnel, and utilising the world-wide organisation of the ablest under-takings in other transport fields.We cannot get that without bringing in the best of these undertakings.In order that B.O.A.C. may profit by what these operators can give andalso supply its own experience, B.O.A.C. should be a partner with them onroutes they operate; and some of thern should be interested in some of theB.O.A.C. routes. This integration of interest should make it possible to strengthenB.O.A.C. administration by reinforcing with experienced personnel drawTn fromother transport undertakings.6..   I. think the following would be the most effective combination anddistribution :  (a) On the Empire routes (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) (a) B.O.A.C. would operate in parallel with the Dominions and India, leading, it is hoped, tojoint operating companies at a later stage.(iv) (b) United Kingdom-United States B.O.A.C. would operate,&apos;               possibly with Shipping Companies having a minority interest.(v) West Africa. B.O.A.C. and Shipping Lines should operate in partnership. If West African Colonial Governments desire, theyshould have an interest in the branch operating in and between their territories. I understand they would prefer to have their servicesrun for them, but in agreement with them.(vi) Pacific. B.O.A.C. would be in a joint operating company with Australia and New Zealand; the services running in parallel witha Canadian service.(vii) Bermuda-Canada, Bermuda-United States. The companyoperating these routes should be a combination of the BermudaGovernment, B.O.A.C., and probably Furness Withy.(viii) The route United Kingdom to West Indies can be mosteconomically and conveniently operated by the company responsiblefor the South American route. B.O.A.C. and the West Indies shouldbe partners. This partnership should include lines linking the west indies with South America and Central America.In a number of territories served by the Commonwealth trunkroutes, there will be short-range air services connecting with the trunk routes and in some cases flying&apos; stopping services along a partof a trunk route; as for example in,East Africa and the Ehodesias.These services will be operated by local companies; but B.O.A.C.should be prepared to give technical assistance to and, where desire-able, take an interest in, these companies.
(&amp;) South America should be operated by the Shipping Companies, B.OA.C.having a minority interest.(c) United Kingdom Egypt.   A joint B.O.A.C. Egyptian Company, nowunder negotiation. Negotiations are also in progress for a jointIraq B.O.A.C. Company to operate services in Iraq and betweenIraq and adjacent countries.s(d) and (e) Internal air services in the United Kingdom must operate inclose co-operation with rail and road transport. ServicesBby air and rail must be co-ordinated to help each other; and there must bea complete system of through tickets and interchangeability of tickets.This is fundamental and involves the fullest co-operation between air and rail.It would probably be sound to combine United Kingdom services to Europe and United Kingdom internal services in a single company.An increasing number of United Kingdom-Continental services willrun from and to provincial . centres in the United Kingdom. Alsoaircraft should be interchangeable, between Continental and internalservices. Here again the most complete interchangeability of ticketsis necessary.In both internal and Continental air services full use must be madeof the Rail and Shipping organisations and their Continentalagencies.   Economy and efficiency alike require this.This Company should be a combination of Railways, shipping lines with Continental and United Kingdom services, other pre-warair companies running services in the United Kingdom, and B.OA.C.I should also like the Travel Agencies to take an interest in this Com-pany. B.O.A.C. should have a substantial interest, but should nothave control of management. The Railway Companies should have asubstantial interest, but I think not a majority.For many reasons I think it is desirable to identify the interests ofEuropean countries as closely as possible with this Company. TheCompany should therefore be empowered to form Joint subsidiaryoperating companies with European countries.7. It has been suggested to me that B.O.A.C. is not a good title and that itwould be an improvement and more indicative of its main functions if it wererenamed British Commonwealth Air Services. This title would be particularlyappropriate if, as I hope, parallel operation with Dominion companies ultimatelymerges in joint undertakings. The capital of British Commonwealth air services would be owned as at present by His Majesty&apos;s Government. - .It will probably be convenient for British Commonwealth Air Services toestablish separate subsidiary companies for the different routes for which it is responsible. This will simplify the formation of a joint company on anyparticular Commonwealth route. It would also enable British CommonwealthAir Services to arrange for a holding by another transport undertaking, e.g., ashipping line, which could contribute materially by bringing in its experience and its organisation. Such an arrangement would also, I think, be convenient to the Treasury. It would have power, with the approval of the Government,to invest in operating companies allotted to other interests, e.g., the UnitedKingdom, Europe, South America.8. It is an essential part of the Plan that the Government should decide how many operating companies should be established and should approve the interests which should be embraced in these operating companies, and should allot to these companies the routes they are to operate. The Minister should also, I suggest, havethe right to approve the members of the Board of Directors; and the length of tenure of office of directors should be prescribed. But once these companies are established, they should be responsible for the operation and management ofthe air services under their control. While management must vest in the company,the Government must have a general control over broad aviation policy, e.g., allcompanies must conform to the policy laid down by international convention orby bilateral or multilateral arrangements entered into by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. When the companies are formed, it will be part of the arrangement thatthey shall operate the air routes and services to be assigned to them. They shouldnot have power to cease operation on any route which they had undertaken to operate without the consent of the. Government; but such consent should not beunreasonably withheld. Similarly, if any operating company wishes to operate on a new route it must obtain the approval of the Government. Again, the[29060] B 2
Government may wish to have a particular route operated either within theCommonwealth or outside it. The Government should have the power to require an operating company to undertake services on such a route; but if the operatingcompany satisfies the Government that such a service could not be undertaken without loss, the Government must be prepared to give the company such temporary financial assistance, direct or indirect (e.g., by special arrangementsfor the supply of aircraft) as may be reasonable. -   -9. I have dealt with the routes for wnich definite plans must be made now.If this plan is approved, it should not be regarded as a sealed pattern for all time.New routes will be required as civil aviation develops and expands; and verypossibly new types of services also. We should be free to deal with these in what-ever way is considered most efficient and economical as and when the situationarises.10. I have had a good deal of discussion with the Minister of aircraft production how best to provide aircraft for British Operating Companies, andalso for Dominion, Colonial and Foreign operators, particularly during the transitional period before the new British types are proved and available. Theaircraft we stall have for disposal during the interim period will be partly surplusmachines from the R.A.F. converted to civil use, and partly machines of interimcharacter based on Service types adapted to civil use, such as Yorks, Lancastrians,Tudors, V.C. 1. Orders for these aircraft have been placed by MA.P. with treasury approval, as have the orders for the new &quot; Brabazon &quot; types. We wantBritish and Dominion Operators to have the new types as soon as they are in production. It is also enormously in the interests both of our export trade and ofthe British aircraft industry that we should hold foreign buyers during theperiod until our new machines are ready, and so prevent these operators becomingtied houses to the United States, who are offering aircraft like D.C.3&apos;s on very favourable terms, and whose new aircraft will be ready before our own.The only way in which we can hope to do this is by leasing or chartering ourconverted aircraft or interim types on sufficiently attractive terms, until our new aircraft are ready.I therefore endorse the proposal originally made by the Minister of aircraft production that a Government-owned Company should be established to own andlease aircraft. This would not preclude Operators from buying aircraft outrightif they desired to do so.There are other functions which this company could usefully perform..11. I accordingly propose that a Central Company should be formed, thecapital of which will be wholly owned by the Government and the directorsappointed by the Government. This company would have the following-functions : (a) It would buy, own, and lease or charter aircraft used by British operating-companies and all aircraft which are leased or chartered to Dominion,Colonial or foreign operators. For this purpose the Company shouldhave associated with it an Advisory Committee of air line operators,as it is essential that there should be the closest contact between theoperator and the manufacturer.(b) It would be responsible for the training of air crews, including thetraining for Commonwealth or foreign companies, where suchoperators ask the United Kingdom to undertake this. It should have authority to- undertake this training, either directly or by arrange-ment with British operating companies; but it would be the duty ofthe central company to ensure the highest common standards were maintained.(c) It should be prepared to give technical and operational help to foreigncountries. It should be able to do this either directly or by arrange-ment with the British operating company in the area.(d) It should have a special responsibility for the welfare of pilots and aircrews. For example, a special Provident Fund should be establised for these men and their dependants, to which the operating companies,the central company and the men would contribute. As agent for theGovernment it might be made responsible for seeing that suitableconciliation machinery was adopted by the operating companies inrelation to their staffs.(e) It should have a special responsibility for research work in connectionwith Civil Aviation.   Actual research can best be undertaken by the
Government research organisations, or by the research departments ofcommercial companies working closely with those organisations; butthe central company should have the duty of saying in what directionsand with what objectives research in regard to civil aircraft can be most usefully undertaken, and ensuring that it is carried out.(/) As in the past, the Government will have to own and operate thecentral airports used by international air services. It is worth considering whether the central company would not be the appropriateGovernment agency for owning and possibly for operating theseairports.(g) Similarly, where the Government provide navigational facilities and/orconduct operational control of non-Government-owned airports, it maybe that a central company would be the convenient agency for thispurpose.The suggestion in (g) is only included as a possibility which I should like toconsider further. I think it may well be that the Minister responsible for civilaviation should be directly responsible for the provision and operation ofnavigational facilities and the operational control of airports.S.Ariel House, W.C.2,20th January. 1945.
