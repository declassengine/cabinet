THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTOP SECRET.CENSORSHIP SUMMARY FOR WEEK ENDING 16th DECEMBER, 1944.Mail read       .........        728.Mail released.........      1,830.General.If the main object of last week&apos;s writers was to impress people at home to disregard press and wireless news, more in order to quieten them down, develop-ment of events, here and at home, show in this week&apos;s mail a definite stand againstanything connected with the press and news. &quot; From close observation there hasbeen a lot of distortion and misrepresentation in the press.&quot; What the papersare writing about is simply regarded &apos;&apos; as rubbish &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; the nonsense they seemto produce is making us boys out here simply mad.&quot; &quot; What the press is actuallydoing is nothing but encouraging the rebels that we are not backed by the peopleat home.&quot;The consequence of this outburst is a full backing-up &quot; in this case&quot; ofMr. Churchill&apos;s policy. His speech has &quot; bucked up the boys no end.&quot; M.P.s inParliament talk &apos;&apos; about things they know nothing about &apos;&apos; and some of them&quot;would make better road-sweepers than M.P.s&quot;Hope is expressed that some of &quot; our brilliant M.P.s come to Greece, knockthese meek little brigands&apos; heads together and tell them to be good boys and havea proper election.&quot;&quot; ChurchiU&apos;s vote of confidence was a great pleasure to us.&quot; Whilstblaming him for &apos;&apos; upholding the King and putting us all in a position withregard to Greece,&quot; it is realised that &quot; he knew a sound thing from a bad one.&quot;Many comments are that &apos;&apos; these--1  have been stocking up the ammowe dropped to them to use against Jerry, and that, instead, they waited for thischance for 3^ years, whilst opinion is also -strong that Germany and Bulgaria arebehind this show. All the more reason to fully approve &apos;&apos; our actions as absolutelyright and as the only possible course open to us.&quot;Without lowering the morale of the troops, the strain is felt by many involved,more or less, in this situation. The approaching Xmas, which they expected to bethe best, after the good reception, may apparently be the worst &quot;bully andbiscuits, if not unlucky &quot; leaves traces of nostalgia in their letters. Yet, intrue Christian spirit, they feel sorry, not only for themselves, but also for &quot; thesepoor people here such a pity after the terrible years they have been through,&quot;since the majority of the people are still regarded as intensely pro-British.An Officer : &quot; My final word is that I hope Britain will never find herself insuch a position as Greece.&quot;1. From an N.C.O.&quot; I&apos;m not going to give any facts re the present fighting because I believe it&apos;s all in the communiques from General Scobie, which are in the papers at home.It&apos;s certainly not, shall we say, pleasant, but not anything that a member ofHis Majesty&apos;s forces mustn&apos;t expect. Your papers at home seem to be printinga lot of high political ideas and lots of people seem to be shouting about somethingthey know absolutely nothing about. Don&apos;t you go drawing any conclusions,darling, because on what you read in the papers you have no chance of graspingthe true position. Mr. Churchill is nearer the mark than anyone.&quot; (H.Q.,3 Corps.)2. From an Officer.... From what I can gather here, the fact that some of the newspapers aretalking such nonsense about the position has caused less attention to be drawn to this affair, and that is all to the good. I have not met anyone here who doesnot think that Churchill is taking the only step possible^and they are a longGreece )m being 100 per cent- Government supporters generally.&quot;   (M.L., HQ.,[28919] B
3. From an Officer.&quot; As you must know by now, we are having a spot of bother here, and whileit is not possible for me to divulge much concerning the situation here, I can sayfrom very close observation that there has been a lot of distortion and misrepresented-sentation of many facts in the press in particular. Apart from the main political problems, and I am not in a position to write about the rights and wrongs of anyparticular side, the fact remains that &apos; Elas &apos; and their henchmen have starteda fight, and are carrying it on in such a way that the maximum of hardship isbeing imposed upon the civilian population of Athens. The general strike, the closing of shops and bakeries (bread is now  1-^ a loaf), indiscriminate firing ofall arms which has resulted in large-scale civilian casualties, all confirm the belief that the people who are taking part in this are far from being liberators.I quote one example : One particular sniper hit seven people in one day two British soldiers, who were slightly wounded, and five civilians, one of whomwas a woman of 50 who was hit in the chest and died on the way to hospital.The civilians were Only out on the street trying to scrounge a little food fromsomewhere or the other.&quot;   (13 B.C.P.O.)4. From a W.O. &apos;   ,&quot; I think the news you had at home in the early stages was a little vague,but in the circumstances it was largely unavoidable, as for the few days it was.rather vague here as well, but we all know where we are now, and, believe me,Mr. Churchill and his speech bucked us no end, we know now what we are fightino-for, and against, it is obviousy a Hun element behind all this trouble, it is stereo0typed.&quot;   (690 Coy. R.A.S.C.)&apos;5. From an Officer.&quot; The thing that is making all the boys out here as mad as hell is the waythe thing is being misrepresented in the press at home. This is a thing that mustbe done believe me, the beggars are in the minority, and the terrorism that goes on is-not to be-believed most of these folks do not want to fight the British any-way.&quot;   (1 Dis. M.L., Greece.)6. From an Officer.&quot; The news from Greece I imagine is none too good, but what annoys usmost is the rubbish which the papers seem to be producing. What Churchill saidis partially correct, but there is quite a lot left out. The press are doing muchto hinder us by encouraging the rebels to think that we are not backed up by thepeople at home or America. I ask you. could we stand by and do nothing whilerebels shoot down defenceless people, women and children, blow up their houses,cut their heads off and such acts of barbarism? Are we to allow them to shell-one town and then say, &apos; Now. chaps, don&apos;t do that&apos; ? I say that it is impossible.There is only one answer to a band of armed terrorists and that is force. Wedon&apos;t-like it, but I maintain that it is all part of the rot sown by the Hun. you may ask, why should our boys give their lives to settle Greek political differences,but are they only Greek political differences? I say no, it is all part of the war against the Hun, and we must go on and exterminate this rebellious element.&quot;(HQ.. 3 Corps.)7. From an Officer.&quot; I don&apos;t suppose you&apos;ll get this for some time and everything will be all overby then I expect, but even so, you will be in the picture regardless of whatThe Times correspondent seems to think from the despatches he sends to London..... E.L.A.S., as the other armed party became to be called, became more andmore political and even more sharply Left. So there were two different guerrillaarmies fighting in Greece. Ostensibly both anti-German, actually E.L.A.S. hadquite different views, they were training and arming for quite a different purpose.We, the British, supplied both armies with food, arms, gold, clothes, in fact, any-thing, to help foster the spirit of resistance in an ignorance or stupidity. . - - -Scobie, quite rightly has backed the constitutional Government, that was hisbrief. .... E.L.A.S. and E.A.M. are Communists of the most virulent type,aggressive and murderous, without any atom of patriotism and it. is nothing huttheir doing that things have come to such a pretty pass. When the police firedat them they were justified, in my opinion. I was sorry, they were young girls: anaboys that were killed, but they were placed in front as protection, a very low tonu-of fighting.
The last couple of days have been pretty poor, I&apos;m so sorry for the 80 percent&apos; innocent, who are suffering and will suffer more as Ave can&apos;&quot;  get the food in.But still we are knocking hell out of them with tanks, planes and guns, but whata terrible fate for lovely Athens. Will a better world for the Greeks come out ofthis holocaust or will they never recover %   I don&apos;t know.We are&apos; partly to blame for arming these bad types, so it must be our responsibility to put things right for them even if it takes years. I like the80percent.&quot;   (M.L., H.Q., Greece.)8. From a Bombardier.&quot; The situation in this country seems to be causing quite a stir at home, and Ibelieve the British Labour Party is administering a first-class rocket to theGovernment because of its policy here. Well, I don&apos;t always agree with thethings the Government does, but I must certainly back it up in this case andI&apos;m pretty sure that almost all the British troops here feel the same way.However, I suppose that&apos;s not our pigeon and the powers-that-be will work thingsout in their own sweet way.&quot;   (H.Q., 3 Corps.)9. From an N.C.O.&quot;. It is all the saddest comedy that was ever. The enemy as we call them, theguerrillas as the B.B.C. calls them, are wanting to enforce anarchy by the nastiestof Fascist methods, and they have induced a lot of perfectly nice Greeks who have suffered terribly in many ways, including such as having missed even their normal mite of schooling, to do their bidding from motives that were altogetherexcellent. Most of the Communists and Socialists in the bunch are deluded intothinking the millenium is at hand but can only be got by liquidating everybodyelse, who are highly coloured by propaganda as traitors. They believe they arethe real patriots and they are the tools and victims of the real traitors. It couldnot be more horrid.As ever there has been virtually no other thought or subject or interestexcept the situation so I&apos;m at a complete loss for anything.to say. Churchill&apos;svote of confidence was a great pleasure to us. He is to blame, I think, forupholding the King and therefore putting us all in a position with regard to greece, but I realise now that he knew a sound thing from a bad one and was right about E.A.M. Any smile we bestowed on Royalist partisans was wrong,and so it is now, because they, by their existence, make a political party of the throne and its only excuse is to be the stable factor above party politics,especially here where it is rather an extravagance unless it yields well by pro-viding votes for law and order.&quot; (F.S.S.)10. From an Officer.&quot; I was vainly hoping for a very good Christmas here, but it looks likebeing most depressing unless some of the soldiers one sees walking about do something. Alternatively, we are hoping for some of our brilliant M.P.s to cometo Greece, knock these meek little brigands&apos; heads&apos; together, and tell them to be good boys, and have a proper election. We would get a good laugh to see themtrying, anyway.Roger must have given you a pretty detailed account of all this nonsense,but I may say that I think his views are, if anything, too mild. My reactions areslightly more violent, and if I had my way the first to feel the repurcussions ofthe action I would like to take would be the reporters. By their incompetenceand misrepresentation they have managed to give the wrong impression to thewhole world.&quot;   (M.L., H.Q., Greece.)11. F rom a Private.&quot; Well, I suppose you are wondering what is happening out here. Well, allI can say is that they are idiots like the fools (Labour) in the Government whocaused the Premier to offer to- resign, when one stops to think over some of thethings the M.P.s say about things they know nothing about, I begin to thinksome of them would make better &apos; Road Sweepers&apos; than M.P.s.&quot; (4 Bn.Para. Regt.)[28919] e 2
12. From an Officer.&quot; I wonder if you&apos;ve been worried at all over the news. From afar it mustappear most unu*sual, but I can assure you that the British authorities know v,&apos;hatthings they&apos;re doing and Churchill was well informed you may have heard, orread, his speech in the House of Parliament the other day. It&apos;s a most unhappybusiness because the ordinary townspeople are absolutely starving again, ftmeans that our relief plan that is, food and clothes distribution is at a stand-still.&quot; . (HQ., 3 Corps.)13. From Rank unknown.&quot; The guerrillas are dug in some little distance away, and all day we canwatch the Air Force and a couple of destroyers bash away at them. Somehow i cannot imagine them keeping this farce up much longer, needless to say the devilshave been stocking up the ammo that were dropped to them to use against Jerry,the crafty devils have waited 3^ years for this chance, but as you know it has back-fired on them, they never expected that we would intervene, but apparently theydid not reckon on their methods being just the ones we are fighting this war for.I heard the results of the debate in the House of Commons, and&quot;believe me the foolswho had the cheek and ignorance to criticise our methods in dealing with thesebrigands (they are little more and have been outlaws in the hills for years), want to&apos;get out here and learn the true facts.&quot;   (No unit stated.)14. From an Officer.&quot; Once more I am on the spot to see history in the making, this is tragicbut inevitable, and in my opinion we are absolutely right in our action, one mightcall this the 2nd liberation of Greece.&quot;   (M.L., H.Q., Greece.)15. From an N.C.O.&quot; I have told you most of the happenings during the past week in my letter-card, although you may find it rather patchy and not perhaps very interesting.Of course you will have what the B.B.C. give you, so do we, but the least said the better! It is difficult to realise that we only arrived a few weeks ago asso-called &apos; liberators &apos; and now all this trouble is going on, and we are in it.Army life has made me a lot harder than I was when I left home, but believeme all this has increased my feelings in this respect. To me now the talk aboutthe beauties of Greece do not mean a thing, because if I had my way there would&apos;ntbe any in a very short while. The methods of the fighting of these people.are ofthe lowest, and that I do not like one scrap. If one has to fight, at least fightthe clean way. I do not suppose it would do to write of some of the methodsjust yet, but still, they will keep until the days when I do relate my variedexperiences to all and sundrv. This is part of it I will never forget.&quot; (HQ.,3 Corps.) 8        &quot;16. From an Officer.&quot; Soon, however, the difficulties became apparent. No one had any work, andthe industrialists, some of whom had stocks, feared to start enterprise owing tothe political situation. In Athens E.L.A.S. had fallen under the influence of theextreme Communist element (K.K.E.), who staged non-stop demonstrations whichthe populace were compelled to attend. Young men from the roughest areasdressed in plain clothes, but armed to the teeth, maintained control by means ofa highly organised party machine backed by terrorism. The central Government,which had been brought over from Egypt, was rather weak, especially in itsfailure to deal with collaborationists, and a few weeks ago the Left-wing memberswithdrew when it became obvious the extremists were going to force the issue.The Government had issued an order that arms in the hands of private individualsmust be surrendered by the 10th December, after which various age groups wouldbe called up to create a national army. The country is full of arms, these havingbeen sent in by us during the occupation period. In few cases, however, werethese arms used against the Germans, for they were reserved with a view to use to obtain power politically after the Hun had departed. So the scene was set forthe revolution.&quot;   (H.Q., 3 Corps.)17. From an Officer.&quot; The situation here is absurd. I do not know how much has been said athome about Greece and the Greeks, but there is no doubt in my mind that the very
large majority of the people are really friendly to us, and it is these few extremists.-who have, by well-organised terrorism, built up quite a formidable army. . . . .There were one or two&apos; rather awkward moments when there were conflictingstatements between Eden and the reported statements of the military leadershere.  However, we have weathered that through and we had a pretty sticky trip&quot;out as we were surrounded and had to come the hard way.&quot;   (514 Fd. Survey Coy.)18. From an N.C.O.&quot; At &quot;first I felt very sorry for the people, and I was eager to see everything,but now all this trouble has started my feelings toward them has changedconsiderably, we gave them food and helped them on their feet, and now they&apos;re.shooting us, it would probably done them good if we had left them with theGermans, still that isn&apos;t for me to say, they&apos;re not all alike, and I hope thistrouble will sort itself out soon.&quot;   (T.S.B.O. Sect. D.T.S.)19. From a Sapper.&quot; I feel really sorry for the people here who are having the place moresmashed up now by their own countrymen (and us) than they had during the restof the war. Besides this they are short of food and are ever asking us for water.It is difficult to realise the change that has come in a few days, and it will certainly be a long time before they can ever reach that standard again.&quot; (514 Fd. SurveyCoy., RE.)20. From an.Officer.&quot; Such excitable folks the Greeks. But I can&apos;t help liking them, in spite ofall that&apos;s happened, and I hope this horrible business will soon be at an end.Field-Marshal Alexander turned up here the other day right in the middle of a first-class battle, so he can&apos;t have any illusions about what is happening here. Inthe words of Winston, the atmosphere is one of &apos; sober confidence,&apos; and I hopethe day isn&apos;t far distant when I can walk round this wonderful city again without some silly ass trying to hit me with a bullet. It&apos;s a comic opera war ! Look afteryourself and for goodness sake don&apos;t worry.&quot;  (A.F.H.Q., British.)21. From an Officer.&apos;&apos; As for us, I can see we have taken the only possible course open forus.&quot;   (1244, C. E. Wks.)22. From a Driver.We have got to be careful in this country. There is plenty people all forus, and there is a bloody lot who is all out for making trouble. I can&apos;t writemuch about it, but things isn&apos;t going too well; we have to keep our rifles handyanyway.&quot;   (118/31, Fd. Regt., R.A.)23. From a Sapper.&quot; As you say, it&apos;s awful to think of all the killing, after what these people have been through, and, believe me, what they are fighting for now is no smallthing; it&apos;s something they are ready to die for. If the people at home who are running this thing think they can smash it with armed force they have anotherthink coming; it might kill a few thousand, but that won&apos;t stop them. This could have been settled in a civilised way between us and the parties here before-e itgot too big; what makes me so sure of this is that&apos;s how it will have to finish inthe end, and if it can be done afterwards it could have been done before.&quot;(514 Fd. Survey Coy., R.E.)24. From a Private&quot; The place where we are is right.in the centre of all the trouble. I can tellyou we have not had much sleep for the last few weeks.. that&apos;s what we get fromthese people after alb we have done for them. I hope they shoot the whole lot ofthem.&quot;   (R.A.S.G/E.F.I.)25. From an Officer.&quot;I must say that our lads are behaving splendidly. They are not losingtheir tempers, and have still retained their sense of humour, and consider it anironical fact that we are being fired at with weapons which we supplied for use against the Germans.&quot;   (13 B.O.P.O.)
26. From an N.C.O.&apos;&apos; Having given you such a glowing picture, and no doubt made you quiteenvious, I needn&apos;t add how much shaken we were when this trouble started. Ihad some narrow escapes myself the first few days, but now we live in HQ.Building and it&apos;s literally living on one&apos;s job. It&apos;s very boring actually, and usbeing clerks, don&apos;t know how we&apos;re fixed. Working all day, guards at night,and ready for any emergencies. I feel quite fatigued at times, but on the wholeI&apos;m bearing up and getting by. Snipers are a beggar and, like you, I&apos;ve seensome of the exploits of the Airborne Boys.&quot;   (M.L., H.Q., Greece.)27. From (no rank stated).1&quot; All this trouble is a pity, as everything was beginning to run smoothlyand the work was slowly getting under control and we looked like being able toget out a bit more .... The people here are still all for us, it&apos;s these rebelsthat are causing all the trouble, they are using horrid methods of terrorisingthe people and causing such a havoc, even the Greeks are disgusted with them.So much for that,.the rest I will tell you when I get home.&quot;   (M.L., H.Q., Greece.)28. From an Officer.&quot; Had my first sleep of six hours since Sunday last night. It&apos;s a heck of alife trying to sort out the bloke with a gun who&apos;s out to kill you, as distinct from a bloke with a gun who is on your side. I&apos;ve been in some queer positions in my short lifetime, but I think this beats everything. Make no mistakes about it, and for goodness sake assure all British folk you know that Churchill andEden gave the absolute truth to the House of Commons when they said a minority of gangsters was trying to rule Greece and they are not Greeks; thered enemy hand is plain, and already we&apos;ve captured Germans, Bulgarians and italians.&apos;&apos;   (M.L. HQ., Greece.)29. From an Officer.&quot; I fear this will be my worst Xmas bully and biscuits if not unlucky.&quot;(M.L. H.Q., Greece.)30. From an Officer.&quot; The trouble would be over by now but for the fact that the people engagedin the sniping, &amp;c, are mostly dressed in civilian clothes, and it is very difficultto round them up. I think the majority of people in Athens and piraeus are gladthis has taken place. They have been terrorised long enough by these armedgangsters and it is time they were suitably dealt with.&quot;   (Balkan Relief Unit.)31. From an Officer.&quot; These poor people do not look like having a very happy Xmas; such apity, after the terrible years they have been through, to have to suffer more becauseof the plottings of a few gangsters.&quot;   (M.L. H.Q., Greece.)32. From a Driver.&quot; I suppose you will hear quite often on the wireless how things are goinghere. It is to be hoped that they get all this trouble cleared up shortly .... It&apos;sa great pity that things are so bad here as we are so near Christmas, not only forthe troops but for the people, as thev are certainly having a hard time.&quot;(HQ., 3 Corps.)33. From an Officer.&quot; My final word is that I hope Britain will never find herself in such aposition as Greece is to-day. While I can&apos;t tell you the exact position, it is notwhat most people (i.e., leftists) think it is. One thing I can say is that 98 per cent,of the population is intensely pro-British. The reception we get in the villagesis quite unbelievable.&quot;   (2 Camerons.)(Signed) J. B. GIBSON (Captain),Head Censor.C.M.F., 19th December, 1944.
