(44) 756.21st December, 1944.WAR CABINET.GREECE.Note by the Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister, the attached note by Lieutenant-GeneralGammell about the attitude of the American Services at A.F.H.Q. towards thesituation in Greece, is circulated for the information of the War Cabinet.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,21st December, 1944.Note by General Gammell.Having just returned from Italy, I think it might be of interest to theChiefs of Staff to know the attitude of the American Services, sea, land and air,at A.F.H.Q. towards the situation in Greece.2. From the start, they have been fully in sympathy with the British pointof view and have been ready to support British efforts, as far as they were able.3. Some weeks ago, before the Greek situation became acute., the AmericanDeputy Chief of Staff, General Rooks,. stated at a Supreme Allied Commandersmeeting that, to serve Allied interests it was, in his view, essential to choose a provisional Government for Greece as soon as possible, and to back it by force until free elections could be held; otherwise, in view of EA.M.&apos;s known intentions,there would be confusion and chaos, with no hope of American relief being introduced or free elections held.4. General McNarney acquiesced without comment on the despatch of the4th British Division to Greece and told me that, having started the business, itwas essential to go through with it.5. As far as the Air is concerned, General Eaker, in addition to relievingBritish machines by American to free the former for service in Greece, has alsosent American Fortresses to drop supplies and ammunition in the Athens area, inspite of the fact that if any of these machines had been shot down, it would havebeen very awkward for him.6. Admiral Hewitt, Commander of the 8th Fleet, was very upset to receive a telegram from Cominch preventing the use of American L.S.Ts. to taketroops and supplies to Greece, but explained to Admiral Cunningham that hewas unable to disobey a direct order from his own Service superior. On the otherhand, once a somewhat ambiguous order cancelling the previous ban arrived,Admiral Hewitt ordered his L.S.Ts. to sail for the Piraeus immediately.7.   I have already stated these facts verbally to the C.I.G.S. and V.C.I.G.S.(Signed) J. A. H. GAMMELL,Lieutenant-General.19th December, 1944.[28883]
