THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1945. /SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 5.Mh January, 1945.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-NORWEGIAN RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned recently toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that his compatriots were at the moment ratherdepressed. The terrible sufferings caused by the German devastation in NorthNorway made 1944 the worst year for Norway since 1940. He found his colleagues and countrymen here disappointed that there had not been more public expression of British sympathy. They felt rather forgotten and neglected. M. Lie fully realised the weight of other preoccupations, but, if British leading men couldoccasionally mention Norway in their speeches, her contribution to the common cause and the present plight of her people, it would create an admirable effect on anglo-Norwegian relations.2. I should be grateful if my colleagues would bear this suggestion in mind for use if suitable opportunities arise.A. E.Foreign Office, 4:th January, 1945.12621   [28953]
