THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is- requested that special care may Jbe taken toensure the secrecy of this document.Jgj? RET./ - -.J.  (89). 51,COPY NO.WAR CABINET.PROPOSALS BY THE PRESIDENT Or THKROYA.L.SOCIETY FOR THE USE OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE.Note by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence.For some time past and from several quarters thesuggestion has been put forward that some sort of organisation should be created to bring the services of scientists into closer contact with the needs of theGovernment.      These efforts eventually culminated incertain proposals which the President of the Royal Societyaddressed to me in a letter dated the 13th July.Sir William Bragg&apos;s proposals, which I transmitted to mycolleagues at the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and ministry of Supply, were, briefly, that a small Committeeof not more than six members of the Royal Society shouldbe set up with the following dutiess-(i)    To make themselves aware of whatthe various scientific organisationsunder the Government are doing;whenever possible, to draw attention toknowledge that might be use&apos;., or to menwho have special ability to deal with anyparticular matter, and to report thereonto the Committee of Imperial Defence.

(ii)    To advise the Committee of ImperialDefence, when desired,, as to thebest means of obtaining scientificadvice or information on any matter,and to report in general on anydeficiencies of which they become aware.(iii)    Of their cxm motion to bring to the noticeof the Committee of Imperial Defenceany opinion, suggestion or scientificresult which might seem to be important to the purposes of that Committee.2. In transmitting these proposals to my colleagues onthe 19th July I expressed the view that a body on the lines proposed could not but have beneficial results in helping to maintain and improve the contact of scientists inGovernment Research Establishments with persons of thehighest scientific attainments in the country.    I addedthat a suggestion on these liness coming from the Presidentof the Royal Society, was one which, in my opinion, couldnot be lightly put on one side, and which claimed veryserious consideretion.     With this in mind I suggested thata meeting should be arranged at which the matter could bediscussed.      A meeting was accorcingly provisionallyarranged for the Jlst July.      It was then found that theSecretary of State for War and Sir William Bragg were unableto attend on the date chosen, and the meeting in consequencewas postponed until after the Recess.3- I have now received a letter from Sir William Braggxdated the oth September 1939, which I circulate herewith&quot;for the consideration of my colleagues.      It will be seenthat Sir Willis.....- Bragg has resubtaitted his proposals in afresh and more practical form, designed to meet the changedand urgent circumstances in which we now find ourselves.x-   Annex.-2-

4. Briefly, his present proposal is that theservices of the whole scientific body of this country,as represented by the Royal Society, should be placed atthe disposal of the Government for purposes of advice throughthe channel of the two Secretaries of that Society,Professors Egerton and Hill.This proposal has, in my view, very definiteadvantages, and would go far to ensure the best distributionof national scientific effort in the war.5. I am aware that various objections have in the past been raised to a scheme on the lines of that proposad inProfessor Bragg&apos;s letter of ljth July, as summarised inparagraph  1   above, mainly on the following grounds 1-(l)    That the establishment of a new committee would mean more workand would put a strain on officials who are already very hard pressed.(2)    That the necessary contacts betweenscientists in the Service andscientists outside the Service already existed.I do not wish to enter into a discussion ofcontroversial matters, but, so far as I can see, the plannow proposed is not open to objection on either of these grounds, while its adoption may be of incalculable value.6. I therefore strongly favour acceptance of the offerin Sir William Bragg&apos;s letter of 8th September - at any ratefor an experimental period.    If my colleagues are willing toaccept this conclusion in principle, it might perhaps beleft to me to settle the details with the Departments concerned.(Intd.)

- -Q&apos; &quot;     ANNEX.THE ROYAL SOCIETY,Bur1ingten House,London, 17.1.8th September, 1939.My dear Lord Chatfield.In a previous letter, to which you sent a verykind reply, I ventured, to suggest means of making greater use of scientific knowledge in the defence of the nation.May I now return to the subject?During the late war, the Royal Society undertooka number of investigations for H.M. Government and setup various committees to advise (e.g. the War Food Committee)Investigations on nearly all the lines&apos; on which work wasthen done by the &quot;Royel Society are nov; being carried on bythe Research Departments associated with various departments of State and there would be no  purpose in the Roy,: j. Societydoing what is done better by such Departments.     Moreover,very many Fellows of the Society are already serving on.the various Advisory Committees.     It seems almost certain,however, that new problems requiring scientific attention will arise from time to time and it will be very important to realise their urgency as early as possible and to apply the appropriate scientific methods immediately to theirsolution.       A recent illustration of a scientificdevelopment to meet an urgent practical need for defence is that of R.D.F.      This arose , not solely from within theservice concerned but largely from without.     Again,  thedecision between different types of weipens and. methods of-4-

attack is bound to require statistical treatment, whichin recent instances has originated from independentscientists.      The human problems of war flying are notonly medical and physiological;;    important psychologicalconsiderations exist and the medical needs to be supple-mented by psychological service.     The same is true forthe industrial population subjected to air attack.      Newproblems connected with fuel and food continually arise and need distribution at once to those most competent to solve them.Such illustrations need not be multiplied;    thepoint to emphasise is that new problems may become urgentat any time.      The Royal Society has a great reserve of knowledge and experience which it is desirable to use assoon as a need is discovered, and I write to make a simpleproposal which would help to ensure that that knowledge and experience should be applied with as little delay aspossible.      The proposal is that the two Secretaries of theRoyal Society (who happen between them to have contact with most branches of science) should be attached in some appro-priate way to the establishment of the War Cabinet, whichwould, then have at its disposal a direct connection withthe scientific community.     Such an arrangement would help to ensure that co-ordination of scientific effort inGovernment and other organisations is maintained.From a beginning of this kind, the fuller plansuggested in my previous letter might come to reality aftertrial and experience.      The time, however,, is very urgent and the beginning suggested would probably satisfy presentneeds;    as these grew the larger plan could mature.

Details of this proposal could doubtless besettled by discussion, but to initiate such discussionI enclose a definite plan for your consideration.Yours sincerely,(Signed;    W.-H. BRAGG.President, Royal Society.

PROPOSAL.1. That, during the period of the war, the secretaries of the Royal Societ:/, Professor A.C.G. Egerton and professor A.V. Hill, should be attached to the establishmentof the War Cabinet and provided with an office and.facilities.Both of the Secretaries, if required, could put the whole of their time at the disposal of the Government,apart from (say) one day a week for the work of the Society.2. That their function should be to maintain as closeliaison as possible with scientific research under GovernmentDepartments and in independent organisations;    to assist inthe rapid, application of scientific methods to practical problems arising in the course of the war:    and to putDepartments in touch with the persons most likely to be ableto help in such application.J. In the last financial year the salaries (includingfees) of Professor Egerton and Professor Hill were each ofthe order of  2^000 per annum. Adjustments could be made between their present employers and the Government, if thelatter required their services.
