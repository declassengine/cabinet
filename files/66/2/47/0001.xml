(39) 98, I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues a letterfrom Sir John Maffey on the subject of the recentapproach to Mr, de Valera regardling the use ofBerehaven.A. ERichmond Terrace, S.W.1.27th October,  1939.

Office of the United kingdom representative to Eire,50,  Upper Mount street,SECRET AND CONFIDENTIALDublin.26 October, 193&apos;9.My dear Secretary of State,It was sad for me to haveto post to London theunfruitful record of my interview with Mr.  de Valera on Saturdaylast, but I know that you already had few illusions as to theprobable outcome of a request for facilities at the ports.tampering with the neutrality of the ports would raise a stormhere,  the consequences of which are &quot;beyond computation, andwhich would certainly bring him down.    There is a generalconsensus of-opinion as to that.among all classes and interests in Eire.    It is remarkable howeven the &quot;pro-British&quot; group, men who have fought for the crown and are anxious to be called up again, men whose sons are at thefront to-day,  loyalists in the old sense of the word, agreegenerally in supporting the policy of neutrality for Eire.    they see no possible practical alternative.     I need not speak of theviews of the people on the Left who would like to catchMr.   de Valera tripping.    There are I.R.A.  men on hunger strike in tne gaols here to-aay because England&apos;s difficulty is notbeing seized upon as Eire&apos;s opportunity.&apos;For those who were confident that the ports would be a tour disposal when we needed them,  this is a heavy blow.    IregretThere is no gainsaying Ji,ir.   de Valera&apos;s view that any the policy of neutrality commands widespread approvalTHE RIGHT HONOURABLE ANTHONY EDEN, M. C. . M. P. ,

regret it all the more as in so many ways the Government ofSire have &quot;been helpful to ma since I came here, and this setbackover the ports has obscured the bright side of the picture.On the credit side we must record -(a) Instant reporting of presence of German submarinein Dingle Bay.(b) Arrangement for immediate signalling to us of presenceand whereabouts of enemy submarines.(c) Acceptance of Naval Attache&quot; here with facilities fortravelling and checking up the efficiency of the Eirecoastal watch and ward service.(d) Holding up, at my request, a series of emergency ordersimplementing neutrality in detail.(e) Retention of Admiralty tug at Cobh.(f) Acceptance of the fact that,  whatever the regulations may be,  cur surface craft will pursue and attackhostile submarines in the territorial waters of Eire.(g) Exclusion from instructions to coastal organisationscf azry mention of aircraft.    To-day our aircraft areflying over the headlands of Sire, and even inland, andnothing is being said.Since I saw Mr.   de Valera on Saturday, I have taken theopportunity of stressing, in interviews with the Secretary for external Affairs,  the loss of life which may be incurred in thewinter months owing to cur lack of facilities at Berehaven forrendering help at that critical point, where there is not evena tug.    No doubt, Mr.   de Valera was again consulted about this,for yesterday I was told that we may maintain a tug at Berehaven

I said that we should need at least two tugs to deal withthe situation.    The Secretary for External Affairs said thatI might ash for the second tug later on, and I gathered that itwill probably be granted.    It is quite understood and agreedthat the tug or tugs, will carry a gun.    I hope that thisfacility may be of some use to the Admiralty.    I was not-authorised to make the suggestion, but it seemed to me to hethe moment to try to get something.In Government Buildings it was expected that I shouldbe leaving for London yesterday evening, and Mr.   de Valerasent a message asking me to assure Mr.  Chamberlain of hisgenuine friendship, but to tell him he could not grant whatwas impossible.Y our s s incerely,(Sgd. )    J. L.   MAFFEY.
