Last week in speaking of the announcement aboutthe Russo-German pact I observed that it contained asuggestion that some peace proposals were likely to beput forward and I said that if such proved to be the case we should examine them in consultation with the Governmentsof the Dominions aixd of the French Republic In the lightof certain relevant const GeratloriScBefore I inform the Rouse of the results of thatexamination: I must ask hon Members to recall for a fewmoments the background again at which these proposalsappear,,2.0 At the end of August IU Mo Government were actively engaged in correspondence with the German Government onthe subject of Polandc      It was evident that the situation was dangerous but we believed that it should be possibleto arrive at a peaceful solution If passions were notdeliberately stimulated and we felt quite certain thatthe German Government could if they desired influencetheir friends in Danzig in such a way as to bring about a relaxation of tension and so create conditions favourable to calm and sober negotiation,,      It will, be remembered thatin the course of this correspondence the German Chancellorexpressed his wish for improved relations between our twocountries as soon as the Polish question was settled, towhich Ho Mo  Government replied that they fully shared the wish but that everything turned on the nature and methodof settlement with Polando     We pointed out that a forciblesolution would inevitably Involve the fulfilment   of our obligations to Poland and we begged him to enter into directdiscussions with the Polish Government in which the latterGovernment had already expressed its willingness to take part-o

3. As everyone knows these efforts on the part ofHVM. Government to avoid war and the use of force were in vain.    In last the Presidentof the Unites States made an appeal to Herr Hitlerto come to a conference in order to prevent warbreaking out in Europe and thereafter the King of the belgians, the Queen of Holland, His Holiness the Pope,and Signor Mussolini all tendered their good offices in -vain.      It is evident now that Hitler was determined to make war on Poland and whatever sinceritythere may have been in his wish to come to an understanding with Great Britain it was not strong enough to induce him to postpone an attack upon hisneighbours      On the 1st September Herr Hitler violatedthe Polish Frontier and invaded Poland, beating downby force of arms and machinery the resistance of thePolish Nation and Army.     Polish towns and villageswere bombed and shelled into ruins, and soldiers and civilians alike were slaughtered wholesale and insontravention, at any rate in the later stages, of allthe undertakings of which Hitler now speaks with prideas though he had fulfilled&apos; them-.ko It is then, after this wanton act of aggressionwhich has cost so many Polish and German lives,sacrificed to satisfy his own insistence on the use of force, that Hitler&apos; now puts forward his proposals.5, If...

5.      If there existed any expectation that theseproposals would include some reparation for thislatest crime against humanity, following so soon uponthe violation of the rights of the Czechoslovak nation,it has been doomed to disappointment*   The Polishstate and its leaders are covered with abuse.   Whatthe fate of that part of Poland which he describesas the German sphere of interest is to be does not clearly emerge from H.&apos;s speech, but it is evidentthat he regards it as a matter for the considerationof Germany alone and to be settled solely inaccordance with her interests.    The final shapingof this territory and the question of the restorationof a Polish state are, in Herr Hitler&apos;s view,problems which cannot be settled by war in thewest but exclusively by Russia on the one side and German,;/ on the other.6.     We must take it, then,  that the proposalswhich Herr Hitler puts forward for the establishmentof what he calls &quot;the certaintjr of European security&quot;are to be based on recognition of his conquests andhis right to do what he pleases with the conquered.It would be impossible for G.B. to accept anysuch basis without forfeiting her honour and abandoningher claim that international disputes should besettled by discussion and not. by force.7*     * * a

7,      The passages in the speech designed to givefresh assurances to Herr Hitler&apos;s neighbours I passover, since they will know what value should be attachedto them by reference to the similar assurances he has given In the past.    He objects strongly, he tells us,when a foreign statesman charges him with breakinghis word.    But who was it said in November 1935&quot;Germany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the internal affairs of Austria,  to annex Austria,  or to conclude an Anschluss,&quot;?Who was it in May 1936 said -&quot;The lie goes forth again thatGermany to-morrow or the day afterwill fall upon Austria or Czechor-Slovakia,    I ask myself always?who can these elements be who willhave no peace, who incite continually,who must sow distrust, and want nounderstanding?&quot;These are the words of Herr Hitler himself.    Yet inMarch 1938 German troops without warning marched intoAustria.Who in September 1938 said -.&quot;The Sudetenland is the lastterritorial claim which I have tomake in Europe ..... I have assuredMr.Chamberlain, and I emphasize it now, that when this problem issolved Germany has no more territorialproblems in Europe.&quot;And who said -:,We have assured all our immediateneighbours of the integrity oftheir territory as far as germany is concerned.    That is no hollow^phrase;    it is our sacred will..&quot;As before,  these are Herr Hitler&apos;s very words.    Yet it isthe same Herr Hitler who complains if others doubt hisgood faith.But .,.

8.        But not less disturbing than these examples of failure to adhere to his pledged intention are thsradical departures by Herr Hitler from the lohgprofessed and fundamental principles of his policy andcreed.The first of these principles forbad theinclusion bf non-Germans within the Reich.On September 26th, 1938, Herr Hitler said?-&quot;We are not interested in suppressingother nations.      We do not want to seeothef nations among us. &quot;And on September 28th he repeated with greatearnestness to me that he had no wish to include inthe Reich people of other than German race.Yet within less than a year Germany has ineffect included in the Reich eight or nine millions ofCzechs, and now claims the right to dispose of the fate of many more millions of Poles.9, A further feature which may be said tohave dominated Herr Hitler&apos;s policy was his adhorrenceof the Soviet Bo Ishevlst system.In 1936 Herr Hitler said:-&quot;We see in Bolshevism a bestial, maddoctrine which is a threat to us.    i cannot make a pact with a regime whosefirst act is not the liberation of workmen but of the inmates of gaols. &quot;InIn .. *

In 1937, he s ai d: -We look upon Bolshevism as upon an intolerable danger to the world;we shall try to keep this danger away from the German people by every means at our command ..........  we should avoid all contacts with thesepoisonous bacilli .-. *. *..... Any treatylinks between Germany and present-dayBolshevist Russia would be withoutany value -whatsoever. &quot;As late as the end of April, 1939, (barelyfour months before, he made his pact with theSoviet) he said:-&quot;Tf the sub-human forces of bolshevism had proved victoriousin Spain,  they might easily havespread across the whole of Europe&quot;,By August,   the whee-l^had comjeL-full circleand we find him saying:-&quot;The pact of friendship between germany and Soviet Russia willnot only render possiblepeace but a happy -and permanentco-operation. &quot;

10.       This repeated disregard of his word and thesesudden reversions of policy bring me to the fundamentaldifficulty in dealing with the wider proposals inHerr Hitler&apos;s speech.     The plain truth is, and everybodyknows it, that in the light of past experience it is nolonger possible to have faith in the word^of the presentGerman Government, and therefore no reliance can beplaced on any agreement to which they put their name.11. I am certain that all the peoples of Europe,including the people of Germany, long for peace, a peacewhich will enable them to live their lives without fear,and devote their energies and their gifts to thedevelopment of their culture * the pursuit of their idealsand the improvement of their material prosperity.     What acontrast between such a peace and the horrors of war onwhich Herr Hitler has dilated at such length in his speech.     But what stands in the way of such a peace?     Itis Germany and Germany alone which by her repeated acts of aggression has robbed all Europe of tranquillity andimplanted in the hearts of all her neighbours an abidingsense of insecurity and fear.12. Many        the pacts and conventions whiC-h germany has signed in the past dealing with the limitation of theuse of arms and weapons of warfare.      But they have notsufficed to prevent her from using any of these weaponswhen it suited her purpose and something much more solidthan pacts and conventions are wanted now to give backto the world the confidence which has been shattered.Do ...

Do we then want to crush Germany as Herr Hitlermaintains?     By no means.     It is not, and neverhas been part of our policy to exclude a germany which will live in amity and confidence with us from her rightful place in Europe.     But the peace whichwe are determined to secure must he a real and settledpeace, not an uneasy truce interrupted &quot;by constantalarms and repeated threats and mobilisations.     Peacecannot be settled or real if it is to be achieved bydictation.IS.       His Majesty&apos;s Government do not in this war seekmaterial profit for themselves - they know all too well that in modern war between Great Powers victor andvanquished suffer cruel loss alike.     But surrender towrong-doing spelt the extinction of all hope, and theannihilation of all those values of life which havethrough centuries been the inspiration of human progressBelieving this, the British people areresolved to make every effort in their power to win for themselves, as for others, liberty through respect for law, and to establish the right of all peoples- freed from the dark shadow of fear, to decide their own lives and destinies.14, The conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government aretherefore as followsHerr Hitler ..

Herr Hitler rejected all suggestions for peaceuntil he had overwhelmed Poland, as he had previously-overthrown Czechoslovakia.      peace*) conditions cannot he acceptable which begin by condoning aggression.The so-called peace proposals in Herr Hitler&apos;sspeech are vague and uncertain and they contain, no suggestion of reparation for wrongs dene to czechoslovakia and to Poland,Even if his proposals were more closely defined and contained suggestions for reparation for these wrongs itwould be useless to discuss them until a preliminarycondition had been satisfied,     Germany must firstconvince the world that her aggressions will cease andthat her pledges will be kept.     Acts, not words alone,must be forthcoming before the Allies,-would be justifiedin ceasing to wage war to the utmost of their strength.There can be no new and better world order of thekind that all the nations want until this preliminarycondition has been fulfilled:    only so would the way be opened for discussion and ultimately for settlement.The issue is therefore plain. Either Germany must give convincing proof of the sincerity of her desire for peace by definite acts and by the provision of effectiveguarantees of her intention to fulfil her undertakings orwe    * r

we must persevere in our duty to the end. It is for germany to make her choice.
