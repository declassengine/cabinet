THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO. y uWAR CABINET.CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.COMMENTS ON GENERAL GAMSLIN?S OBSERVATIONS ONOUR APPRECIATION ON THE POSSIBLE COURSE OF THE&apos; WAR (PAPER NO    C. O.S, ( 9&apos;Jf35In accordance with the instructions of the WarCabinet, the Chiefs&apos;  of Staff Appreciation on the possible future course of the war  (Paper No. CCS. (39)  35) was handed to the French Permanent Military Representatives, and their comments were invited.     The French Permanent Military.Representatives referred the Appreciation to their superiorsin Paris.      Subsequently, General Gamelin&apos;s observations were received, and a copy is attached&apos; to this Report as Annex.I.We have the following comments to make with reference tocertain of the points raised.COMPARISON OF FORCES.   (Paragraph 3 (a)).2. Assuming that we accept the French view that germany must leave 30 Divisions to hold Poland and watch Russia,she would have available in the near future for action onthe Western Front 100 Divisions.3. According to the latest information, the French have&apos;63 Divisions on the North-Eastern front.      There will shortly be 4 British, making a total of 67-     In addition to these the French have from 12 to 14 Divisions of Fortress troops on that front, but General Gamelin does not seem to have takenthese into account.      It seems, therefore, that a truecomparison of forces would be:-Germany 100 DivisionsFrench and British   79 Divisions.OFFENSIVE ACROSS FRANCO-GERMAN FRONTIER.   (Paragraph 3(b)).4. It will be seen that General Gamelin considers thata German offensive across the Franco-German frontier is)not improbable.      Further elucidation of this view wasi sought at a meeting on 29th September between the British&apos; and French Permanent Military Representatives.     The latterconfirmed that General Gamelin considered a very vigorousattack even on to tbo.Maginot Line was a possibility.The latest information of movements behind the Germanfront tends to confirm, this view..(50) 61.

o1 &apos;3INTERVENTION IN BELGIUM.     (Paragraph 3  (c) and (d) ,5- (i) By land forces.      The general problem of intervention by French.and British troops in Belgium is dealt with in the first part of the Note referred to inparagraph 3 (c) of General Gamelin*s observations.    this note is attached at Annex II.     General Gamelin also refers,in paragraph 3(d)? to the question of the forces to besent to Belgian territory for the purpose of holding the scheldt.6. The British Field Force, which forms a part of the armies of the North East commanded by General Georges, isat present taking up a position from Maulde on the Scheldt,to Menin on the Lys.      General Gamelin has a project, whichcan only be put into effect in favourable circumstances,for swinging forward the British Field Force, and the french army on its left, to the line of the Scheldt.     In that casethe British Sector would be from Maulde to Bossuyt.7. There is no intention of carrying out this projectunless there has been previous planning and preparation withthe Belgians, or unless sufficient time can be gained by theBelgian defence for the new position to be properlyorganised.      It is this project which forms the subject. ofGeneral Gamelin&apos;s letter of 23rd September to general ironside to which reference is made.8.        (ii) By air forces.      The co-operation of air forces with the French Army, in withstanding an attack throughBelgium, has two aspects.      First, an offensive againstthe advancing German columns.     Plans for such action arenow being worked out with the French General Staff and AirStaff by Officers who have been specially sent over toFrance for the purpose.     Secondly, action by fighters and anti-aircraft artillery to withstand the attacks of the, German air force.     At the last meeting of the Supreme Warp\ Council, the French asked for further assistance in this matter, and certain additional measures were approved by the[ War Cabinet on 27th September.sTHE BALKAN QUESTION.    (Paragraphs 4 and 5).9- We do not propose to comment on General Gamelin&apos;observations in this paragraph.     A detailed study of the balkan question is being made by the French and BritishPermanent Military Representatives.     As regards the pointmentioned in the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 5^ we arenot prepared to agree that, if Italy were hostile, the combined British and French Fleets could secure the sea communications of allied forces in the Balkans, at any ratein the early stages of war.     Our views on   this point were communicated to the French by our Permanent military representatives.(-Signed)     C.L.N. NEW ALL....

ANNEX_I.London- 27 th September, 1939.General Gamelin&apos;s Observations on the ReportMcRc(J)(39)1 of the British Chiefs ofStaff dated 18th September.3-*    Paragraphs 1 toi 7;    Agreed generally with French views.2,    Paragraphs^ 6 and t:    There would appear to he littleliKeTihobd o?.a.German-Russian offensive alliance.      TheSoviet Government has profited from the situation by seizingPolish territory more or less without striking a blow.They could repeat this action in the case of Bessarabiawithout thereby coming into the war on the side of Germany.35*   Hypothesis B (Paragraphs 9 to 2h: Attack on Franco-British forces with Italyremaining neutral) calls for thefollowing observations  : ......(a) Germany will no doubt need more than 15 divisions to hold Poland and to watch Russia; it would seem that about30 divisions can be set aside for these tasks.If it is possible for Germany in the near future tobring her land forces up to 130 divisions, France and Englandcan, in approximately the same time, bring theirs to 65to 70 divisions on the North Eastern front;    this figurecould be increased by the forces which could be taken fromthe Alpine and North African fronts if Italy&apos;s neutralitybecame certain.(b) Offensive action against France on the frontier between the two countries is not so very improbable;    it isa possibility with which we have to reckon and one whichmoreover would not take us unawares  (certain recent information even leads to belief in its imminence).(o).       The question of intervention on Belgian territoryhas already been dealt with in note 212/CEMI submitted onSeptember 20th by the French Delegations     This note&apos; brings&apos;out in particular the necessity for British Air Forcesparticipating aotiyoly in -the case of an attack from german forces in.vadj.ng Belgium^(a.)       Finally, the question of the forces to be sent toBelgian territory for the purpose of holding the Scheldt wasthe subject of a letter No. 50 Cob/DN of September 23rdfrom General Gamelin to General Ironside.4*    Hypothesis C (Paragraphs 25 to ,29:    German offensive inthe South East 01 liiurope witn Italy remaTnjn^ neutraXTTThis hypothesis must now include the considerationarising from the presence of the Russians on the late Polish-Roumanian frontier, namely that Germany cannot invadeRoumania except through Hungarian territory without agreementfrom Russia having been obtained previously.If such an offensive gave us the help of Turkey the reaction of the Allies would be to move our land and air

forces from their Hear East bases (the Levant and Egypt)to Balkan bases (Turkey in Europe - Salonica).5. Paragraphs 30 to 54- (G-erman attack in a Westerlydirection or in a Southeasterly direction?, Italy being.,hostile)0     These hypotheses have already been thesubject of numerous exchanges of view in the course ofgeneral Staff Conversations.The picture of the consequences of Italy&apos;s entry into the War such as has been painted by the BritishChiefs of Staff is perhaps on the gloomy side.It is to be hoped that the action of British andFrench Fleets would enable us to obtain such superiority in the Mediterranean that supplies for the Allied&quot;forcesin the Balkans would not depend entirely on the Caperoute and Anatolian railways.6. As to the hypothesis of Turkey joining forces with italy to attack us in the Near Eastp it does not appearnecessary to consider this at the moment.

2l2/C.B.-i:.Is.note RELATIVE TO OPERATIONS IN HOLLAND,BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG.By extending the action of her Armies in Luxembourg,Holland and Belgium, Germany increases by more than 500 k.me the front on which she is in contact with the Land Forcesof Britain and Prance.     She can thus develop her attack in regions where progress is easy and fortifications are few or incomplete -- If Germany reaches the Prench Frontier she is inpossession of bases of departure for aerial attacksituated at less than 200 kom, from Paris and London,- She threatens the English coast0- She can exploit regions which are populous, rich in agricultural and mining products and industriallywell equipped..It is therefore likely that when Germany wishes to makeher military effort against the Western Powers, she willinvade Luxembourg, Belgium and all or part of Holland.The moment at which she will make this effort cannotbe accurately determined, since it is dependent upon theaction which Germany is now able,to complete in the east of Europe, but this moment may be close.In view of this danger the High Command has already taken measures for security.Troops have been placed on -the Northern Frontier ofFrance in order to ensure its defence, and forces arebeing held In reserve in order to parry a German offensivemade through neutral territories.

-4-The course to he followed hy Anglo-French troops will vary, according to the moment at which the Belgianscall for our assistance if this call is not made in time, the Anglo-french troops will absorb the Belgian troops55 on the french frontier or close to it, in the best conditions of defence which are possible under the circumstances.If the call is made in time the Anglo-French troops will enter Belgium in order to support Belgian resistance.But irt this case it is the intention of the French Commandnot to engage in. an encounter battle and to avoid offering-columns on the march as targets to enemy aircraft. thus the action of allied troops in Belgium is conditional upon their having been called for in time and upon their havingthe period of time necessary for taking up. position.Among various recognised lines of resistance in belgium mention was made of (Paper No. A.F.C.(J) 65) :-The line of the Scheldt from Tournai to Oudenardewhich links up in the South at Maulde with theFrench defence line and in the North with theBelgian &quot;National Centre of Resistance&quot; in the region of Ghent.The Meuse from Namur to Liege and the &quot;Albert Canal&quot;,It had already been mentioned (Paper No. A.F.C.(J)65) that it was not possible to consider initially a supporto.f Holland by Franco-British troops in the event of Hollandbeing attacked and calling for assistance from the allies.And possibly Dutch troops ifthey retired in that direction.

Aircraft Action.(a) By Bombers.The action of this air arm aims,  in accordancewith previous agreements (Paper No. A. F.C.(j) 96),above all at retarding the progress of Germancolumns at points which they are obliged topass and at bringing all weight to bear insupport of the main engagement.(b) Action by Fighters and Anti-Aircraft Artillery.In accordance with German tactical principles and with methods employed by them in Poland itis to be expected that the German land offensive -through Belgium and Holland will be supportedby a powerful air attack.    This air attack,which could be led by more than 1,200   bomberswould aim at annihilating Belgian resistance,at retarding the movements of our troops,disorganizing our rear,. and at annihilating ourown air forces -both in-the air and at- their bases.In opposition to this powerful aerial attack the French have at, their disposal, on the totalNorth-Eastern Front,  only 13 Fighter Squadrons1^i.e.  312 aeroplanes of which almost half(6 groupes) are allotted to the land forces andare fully engaged by these duties in support of thethe land co-operation aircraft.    Furthermore,the rear and the movements of allied troops towardsthe Northern Frontier and in Belgium require areinforcement of A.A.  Units as protection fromthe air.x Total number of German long range bombers;approximately 1,750./ It should be stressed that so long as the attitude ofItaly is doubtful, 7 Fighter Squadrons&apos; are maintained in opposition to Italy (four in the South-East andthree in Tunisia).

The intensive use which the enemy may make of hisaviation on the battle field and on the rear of the battlezone creates a danger which could have a decisive influencon the issue of the battle.    The co-operation of BritishFighter Units and A.A. Artillery is indispensable in orderto meet it.For,  if the enemy makes an attack in full force against our Northern Frontier, it is France which isimmediately affected and the whole fate of the war might thus be decided at one blow.It is,  therefore, necessary that Great britain should participate in this battle with all the means ather disposal.Measures of Destruction to be anticipated.The German advance across Holland and Belgiumcan be retarded by measures of destruction, which shouldbe organised, if possible,  in agreement with the belgian and Dutch General Staffs.In order that these measures of destruction caneventually be completed or maintained by our Bomber1 Units,it is indispensable -(l)    that they should be in possession of a generalplan of these measures,  and(2)    that they should have identified the principalobjectives to be destroyed or at least shouldpossess in each case technical data which couldbe used as a bombing objective card.In view of the danger which German occupationof the Flemish coast would create for Great Britain,  itwould be necessary,  in order to effect them withinopportune time, to have decided upon the measures of destruction and obstruction which would prevent the enemyfrom utilising this coast.
