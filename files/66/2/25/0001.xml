THIS &quot;OOGUM.iij.-iT IS THE PRQPS31TY OP .IIS BRIT;A:NIC&apos; MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT!/TO BE&apos;KEPT UNDER LOCK AL-iD key it is requested that special care may be&quot;takento ensure the secrecy of this document.SECRETf7pTT39)75 Copy ho..WAR      cabinet memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF ST^TE POR i^RAt the meeting of the War Cabinet on 23rdSeptember, 1939,  (W.M.  (39) 24th conclusion minute 17)the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs exiolained thathe favoured the voluntary withdrawal of the Tientsingarrison at an appropriate moment which would probablyarise after a settlement of the Tientsin incident.Agreement (i)  to this Minute gave discretion to Sir robert craigie to indicate such a course to the JapaneseGovernment if he was satisfied t iat this course was essential to a satisfactory settlement-.     At a later meeting on 2 Ha September (W.M.  (39) 30th ConclusionMinute 9) it was stated that prospects in tnis matter wereencouraging and that we should be well advised to take nohasty action..Altnou^h the general attitude of the UnitedStates in China is still nebulous, we have receivedindications that they mean to maintain their rightfulClaims in the Far East.Meanwhile/

Meanwhile the recent floods have rendered the&quot;Barracks temporarily uninhabitable and we are faced witha serious repair programme.     The authorities in Tientsinhave power to carry out emergency measures to repair thebuildings but it is estimated tnat the main repairprogramme will cost about  10,000.      The work must be putin hand at once in order to finish it before the snow andfrost season, and unless it is done it is doubtful whether we can keep the battalion iii Tientsin this &quot;/inter withoutrisk of many casualties from ill health.A decision as to the retention of the battalionat Tientsin is thus required as soon as possible.From the military point of view this battalionis a dangerous detachment and should be withdrawn,      I donot, however, without a discussion by my colleagues,prejudge the political implications. I remark only that if the move is to be made the present moment is mostopportune, as we have honourable and valid reasons forwithdrawing provided by the insanitary livm0 conditions at Tientsin5 by the expense involved in repairing the barracks there and by - it must be added - our committmentsin Europe.These reasons will become less convincing as time passes and money is spent on barrack repairs1.( Intd. )    L.
