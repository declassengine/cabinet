MILITARY STRATEGY TO BE ADOPTED IN THENEAR EAST INCLUDING- THE  BALKANS .REPORT.1. In accordance with the c onelusions of the second meeting of the Supreme War Council;,  the British and FrenchPermanent Military Representatives submit the followingcombined appreciation of the broad Military strategy to beadopted in the Near East,  including in particular the balkans.REVIEW OP PRESENT SITUATION IN THE BALKAN STATES.2a    Political Factors.    Rumania and Greece have beenguaranteed by France end England against aggres&amp;iony andtheir sympathies as well as those of Yugoslavia,  areunquestionably on the side of the Allies;    but their feaivof Germany is so real that we must expect them to do allin - thed-J? pov/ei?.-jto- ..a**o-.id a f-ending&quot;&apos;t3-eimaziy-unla.ss...they are actually attacked.    In the case of Greece in particularsany. pressure on the part of the Allies to induce her.toagree to measures which might give offence to germany would almost certainly cause serious internal difficultieswhich might ultimately react to our own disadvantage.Bulgaria being a &quot;revisionist&quot; leans towards the axis power.3-    Economic Factors..    The most important economic resources in the Balkans are the grain and oil supplies in Rumania,which might be essential to Germany.4. . Military Factors. A factor common to all the balkan states is their weakness in war material. The Yugoslavsand Bulgars    are traditionally   good fighters, but in

general it may be said that none of the Balkan powers would be capable of serious resistance to invasion by a first-class power.5o      Turkey.     Provided that her deficiencies of war materialare made good, Turkish forces should be capable of strong resistance to.attack from, any quarter,   .AIMS OP ALLIED POLICY IN THE BALKANS AND THE NEaR EAST.6. The aims of Allied Policy are:(a) To hold and wear out enemy strength away from the Western Theatre of war.(b) To prevent Germany from obtaining controlof economic resources in the Balkans.(c) To provide strategic cover for Franco-Britishinterests in the Near East and in particular to close the Mediterranean to enemy shipscoming from the Black Sea..(d) To prepare a theatre of operations with aview to ultimate offensive operations.(e) To furnish visible evidence of our desireto stand by the Franco-British guarantee to Rumania and Greece,,CONDITIONS AFFECTING ALLIED STRATEGY IN THE BALKANS ANDTHE NEAR EAST.7. Russia&apos;s intentions are obscure.      It is still possiblethat her intervention will act as a brake on Germanpenetration into the Balkans.      On the other hand, the dangerexists that Russia may use her influence with Turkey toprevent her from co-operating with us.    As, however, her^policy is at present uncertain, we have thought it better notto qualify our conclusions by reference to possibleRussian action..The problem of allied, strategy in the Balkans and near East is, therefore, examined under the following broadhypotheses:-(A) Italy neutral - No German attack in SouthEastern Europe.(B) Italy neutral - German attack in South eastern europe.(C). Italy hostile - No^jGermanattack in SouthEastern Europe-^-&apos;(D) Italy hostile - German attack...in^South JSas-ternEurope.

(A)  ITALY NEUTRAL - HQ GERMAN ATTaCK. IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE.8.       This is the present situation,,      The importance of italian neutrality has already been agreed between theBritish and French Higher Commands.      In considering this condition, however, we cannot say for how long Italianneutrality will be maintained, or Germany will refrain fromadvancing into the Balkans.    Our strategy should, therefore,take into account the possibility that condition A may at anytime and with little warning change into condition B,C or D.9.       In this situation, the establishment of a Balkan Blocbenevolently neutral towards the Allies is desirable because-(a) It should help to ensure Italian neutrality.(b) It would restrict the actual area of Militaryoperations until such time as our resources are fully developed.(c) At the present time we can ill afford the greatdrain on shipping resources and supplies whichmight result from an extension of.hostilitiesinto the Balkans and Near East.The disadvantages of Balkan neutrality so long asItaly is also neutral are that it allows Germany free access to neutral resources in the Balkans and also allows Germanyto concentrate all her strength on the western Front;10.     Ve must rely primarily on diplomacy and economic assistance to maintain Balkan neutrality, but there arecertain Military measures which would support this actions(a) Provision of arms to those Balkan States whichcan make the best use of them.(b) Establishment of Allied forces in Syria and egypt for employment in the Near East orBalkans if this should be necessary at alater stage.11.      No.part of our present Military resources should bedissipated on countries which are unlikely to be able touse them to good effect.      For this and the following reasons, we should, therefore, concentrate on providing-4-

as fully as possible for Turkey rather than for Roumaniaor any other Balkan States;(a) Turkey, if she is properly armed, cannot be overrunby Germany, whereas Roumania can easily be swamped.(b) Material given to Roumania would be in danger of falling into German hands and being used against us(c) If Turkey holds out in Thrace, we might  be ableultimately to get into   Roumania &apos; to assist  thatCountry.(d) To a limited extent Turkey can be supplied and supported by land from the Middle East.    OtherBalkan States could not be so assisted.^e)    A strong Turkey would be one of the most important factors in ensuring a neutral Italy.(f)    It is thus clear that Turkey is the key to thesecurity of our whole position in the Near Eastand Balkans.12. Our resources do not allow us to supply arms&apos;inappreciable quantities--to other Balkan States without pre-judice to our own needs and the strength of Turkey.    Neverthe-less, we must do what is possible to support our diplomacy bytoken supplies, and by helping these States to purchase abroad.IS. The concentration of French forces in Syria andBritish forces in Palestine and Egypt would constitute the clearest manif estation-t-o-- the -Balkan Powers of our strength in the,,Mi-ddle East.    It is, however, ess-ential-that--whateverforces may be concentrated in this area shoiild have sufficient reserves to enable them to survive a temporaryseverance of their communications;, should Italy&apos; turnhostile.14*    CONCLUSIONS TO (A).V.E RECOMMEND THAT:(i) Cur policy should be to maintain the neutrality of Italy,  and to consolidate the Balkan Statesinto a benevolently&quot; neutral bloc.(ii) We should endeavour to build up our potentialmilitary resistance to Germany by concentratingour available resources on supporting Turkey,and by forming an amply equipped strategic reserve in Egypt and Syria as forces become available. .

m(iii) We should do what is possible to support ora?diplomacy by sending token supplies of warmaterial to   Roumania, Greece-and Yugo-Slaviajj and by helping these States topurchase further supplies abroad,,(B)  ITALY NEUTRAL - GERMAN ATTACK IN SOUTH-eastern europe.15. If Germany develops an attack in South-eastern europe, Roumania is likely to be her first objective.    Itis unlikely that anything we can do would prevent her from being quickly overrun if she were attacked in the nearfuture.    The most we could hope to do would be to persuadeRoumania to offer the maximum resistance of which she is capable, and at the same time destroy her oil fields before they fall into German hands.16. Although the conquest of Roumania alone would open upthe most valuable economic resources in the &quot;Balkans, germany might well press oh towards the Bosphorus and the Aegeanwith a view to:- *(a) Subsequent action in the Near and Middle East.(b) Obtaining access to the Mediterranean.The attitude of Bulgaria might be a deciding factor in determining Germany^ course of action in this respect.17^ In these circumstances,  we consider that our policy should be generally the same as in Hypothesis A;that is to say:(i) We should concentrate on backing Turkey with war material.(ii) We should endeavour, by diplomatice action andeconomic measures, backed up if possible bytoken supplies of arms to Greece and yugoslavia, to maintain a Balkan bloc, which-&quot;&apos;&apos;might be turned to good account if Germany/s .already precarious^line of o&amp;xwmxnj-aajtdsm wajpeextended towards the Aegean.

 g.       In the event of a German drive towards the Bosphorus andAegean, the above policy should enable us to form a defensivemilitary front with Turkey in Thrace.fiALONICA.19,       If there were a danger of Greece being overrun, thequestion would arise whether Allied forces should be sent to salonica.20.      Ho such commitment should be accepted except at the invitation of Greece and with the prior agreement of Italy.21*       Even in these circumstances any force committed to salonica must be restrict a small scale and a purelydefensive role.    Moreover, the decision to send a force to salonica must only be taken after fully weighing the followingmilitary riskss(a) We should become involved in a military commitment to which it would be difficult to set a limit.(b) A severe strain would be    imposed on our shipping resources.(c) The possibility of Italian hostility cannot be eliminated.    In this event,  it might not be possibleto maintain a force at Salonica so long as a hostileDodecanese threatened the route through- the Aegean,and any attempt to do so would hamper the operations of the British Fleet in other and more importantareas.    Moreover, the force might be exposed to a heavy scale of air attack.22i,.        CONCLUSIONS ON (B ).(i) Roumania is likely to be Germany&apos;s first objective.Nothing we can do is likely to prevent Roumaniafrom being overrun.t(ii) Bulgaria5s attitude may be a deciding factorj in determining whether Germany will press on towardsthe Aegean after the conquest of Roumania.(iii) If Germany does press on, we should concentrate on building up our resources on Turkey, backed by ourown forces in the Levant and Middle East, with aview to forming a military front with Turkey in.Thr ac e-. /(iv) No military commitment should be undertaken at salonica except at the invitation of Greece andwith the prior agreement of Italy.    The role of any force sent to Salonica must be limited tostiffening Greek resistance, and must be purelydefensive.

(G) ITALY HOSTILE - NO GERMAN ATTACK IN SOUTH-eastern europe. &quot; &apos;23* If Italy comes into the war against us, our firstobject will be to concentrate on eliminating her from they/ar by strangling her economically and by attacking hercolonies.    If no German attack has been developed in the balkans, our main concern in that area will be to co-operate with Turkey in attacking Italian trade and the Dodecaneseand to give Greece directly or indirectly any help possibleagainst Italian aggression.224-* With Turkey on our side, Italian trade with the black sea would be completely severed, operations againstthe Dodecanese could be undertaken, and -Greece could be assisted by Turkish forces.      If, however, Turkey should remain neutral, our difficulties would be greatly increased,since control of the sea routes to and from the Black Seawould be more difficult and operations against the dodecanese might have to-be. delayed..   Moreover, Turkey wouldnot help Greece,25. In the defence of Greece the Allies have a special-interest from the naval, point of view in the integrity of the mainland sou.th-.of the line Gulf of Corinth and EuboeanChannel.      Additionally, under the Tripartite Convention wehave agreed on the importance of not allowing an enemy to seize Salonica and of making the defence of this region-inter-allied in character.26. Greek forces are clearly insufficient to cover thedefence of all her frontiers, but an Italian offensive againstGreece is likely to be most unwelcome to Yugo-Slavia anaalmost certain to bring Turkey to the assistance of Greece..It is, therefore, desirable -(a) that the&apos;Allies should take action, diplomatic andmilitary, to encourage Yugo-Slavia to givepositive aid to Greece;(b) that we should be prepared to support any-

immediate military assistance which Turkeymay he able to render through Thrace in thedirection of Sal-nica-The prevision of more direct ass-stance t:. Greece by naval action and particularly the despatch of an Allied force to salonica will depend upon the neutralisation of Italiannaval and air strength in the Eastern Mediterranean.27-     CONCLUSIONS ON (O).(i) Our first object should he to eliminate italy from the war,(ii) With Turkey on our side, we should &quot;be in a goodposition to take acti n to neutralise italy in the Eastern Mediterranean;    but with Turkeyneutral our difficulties would.be increased and v/e could do little to help Greece.(iii) With regard to Greece, we should enc-urageYugc-Slavia to give positive aid to Greece,and we should be prepared to support any immediate military assistance which Turkeymight be able to render through Thrace in thedirection of Salonika,(iv) Until Italy is neutralised in the eastern mediterranean, it would be impracticable toestablish any Franco-British force at Salonica.(D)  ITALY HOSTILE - GERMAN ATTACK IN SOUTH-eastern europe.28*       If with Italy hostile Germany should attack in theSouth-East, Allied strategy would be faced with a serious problem.      In this case the only sound strategy would be toreinfoiece    strength rather than weakness..29.      Turkey is the only country among the Balkan states which is capable of resisting a first-class power and thatajf until she has received --considerable material support.We&quot; should aim, therefore, at building up a Balkan front based*n Turkey in order to protect Allied interests in the middle east.     The first consideration   f our own forces in theMidde   East would, however, be the security of Egypt and syria.

30c In the worst possible, and we hope unlikely, caseof; Turkey being neutral or even hostile, we should be faced with a very grave military situation in the Near andUiddle East and might be compelled to develop a front in syria and to stand on the defensive there.31a CONCLUSIONS on (D).(i) With Italy and Germany both attacking in the balkans Allied strategy should concentrate on the support of Turkey.(ii) If Turkey in such circumstances failed us, weshould hold, a defensive line in Syria.summary op conclusions.320 The following is a summary of the conclusionsarrived at under each Hypothesis, which we consider will help to realise the aims of Allied policy, as set out inparagraph 6 above.      As Russia&apos;s intentions are at presentuncertain, we have excluded reference to the possibleinfluence of Russia.(a). ITALY NEUTRAL - no GERMAN ATTACK in SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE.\/E REC0t.-n.i3HD THATs(i) Our policy should be to maintain the neutrality.of Italyv, and to consolidate the Ballcan Statesinto a beneYoi^atlx jaeuirel KLoo.(ii) We should endeavour to build up our potentialmilitary resistance to Germany by concentratingcas1 available resources on supporting Turkey,and by forming an amply equipped, strategic reserve in Egypt and.

If Germany does press on, -we should concentrate on building up our resources on Turkey, backed by our own forcesin the Levant and Middle East, with aview to forming a inilitary front with turkey in Thrace.No military commitment should be undertaken at Salonica except at the invitation of greece and with the prior agreement ofItaly.      The role of any force sent to salonica must be limited to stiffeningGreek resistance, and must be purelydefensive.ITALY HOSTILE - NO GERMAN ATTACK IN SOUTH-eastern europe.(i) Our first object should be to eliminateItaly from the War.(ii) With Turkey on our side, we should be in agood position to take action to neutraliseItaly in the Eastern Mediterranean;but with Turkey neutral our difficulties would be increased and we could do little to help Greece.(iii) With regard to Greece, we should encourageYugc-Slavia to give positive aid to Greece,and we should, be prepared to support any&apos;immediate^military assistance whichTurkey might be able to render throughThrace in the direction of Salonika.(iv) Until Italy is neutralised:&apos;In the eastern mediterranean, it would be impracticable to establish any Franco-British force at salonica.ITALY HOSTILE - GERMAN ATTACK IN SOUTH-eastern europe.(i) With Italy and Germany both attacking inthe Balkans Allied strategy should concentrate on the stipport of Turkey. -(ii) If Turkey in such circumstances failed us,we should hold a defensive line in Syria,,(iv)

33* Broadly speaking, the measures we have recommendedconsist in :(i) Giving the utmost possible support to Turkey.(ii) Organising in the Levant and Egypt an amplesupply base and a well-equipped Franco-British force.(iii) Encouraging the establishment of a durableBalkan bloc, benevolently disposed towardsthe Allies.(Sgd. )    D.
