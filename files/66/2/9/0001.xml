THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT---i------T-&quot; ^ to BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.H R B T.n.S. (59) 56.W A R     C A BINE T.. CHIEFS O.F STAPP-COMMITTEE.RUSSIAN THREAT TO IMDIA010 We have had under consideration a Memorandum^bythe.. Secretary of estate for India in which he refers tothe growing fears of Russian aggression entertained bythe Afghan Government.      The Memorandum raises three questions in particular:-(i)    The possibility of Russian air attacks on india,(ii)   Measures to impede a Russian advance intoAfghanistan,  and(iii)    Improvement of our intelligence organisation in Russian Turkestan.20 We have very little information; concerningRussian activities in Central Asia, but what little evidence we have indicates that Afghan fears may net be wholly unjustified.On the other hand it is doubtful whether theSoviet,  in view of her pre-occupation in Europe and theFar East,  is prepared at this stage to embark on operations which would bring her into open conflict withthe British Empire.?aper No.W.P.

RUSSIAN AIR THREAT.3. Present information indicates that the Russian airgarrison of the Central Asian Military District is still at its peace strength of 58 aircraft.    This force includes only18 &quot;bombers of the obsolete type which are incapable of attacking objectives in INDIA.4. The capacity of the district is such that if theSoviet were determined on major air. operations againstINDIA it would be possible for them to concentrate a forceof approximately 4D0 aircraft,  of which some  80 might bebombers.    Considerable preparations would, howeve/&quot;, benecessary before a force of this size could be moved intothe area and if our Intelligence Organisation were adequate we could rely on a reasonable measure of warning.5. Modern Soviet bombers have a radius of action toenable them to attack KABUL, the North-West frontier province and to penetrate further mnto INDIA.    Owing,however, to the standard of efficiency of the Russian AirForce and to their policy   of not employing their air force against distant objectives unconnected with land operations?it is very doubtful if in fact the Soviet would attackobjectives bejrond the North-West Frontier.6. The air forces at present in INDIA are clearlyinadequate to dispose of the threat of a large concentration of Russian air forces,    We regard it as most improbable,however, that the Soviet would attempt such operations atthe present time.    Attacks on INDIA would require theemployment of modern long-range bombers, and it is likely that they will require nearly all available aircraft ofthis type to support the large armies they.have mobilisedalong their western frontiers,

While the defence of INDIA against Russian air attack may well call for an increased scale of air defence in the future we have no hesitation in saying that the threat does not at present justify the allocation of aircraft or anti-aircraft weapons to that country at the cost ofthe air defences of Great Britain, the British ExpeditionaryForce or of defended ports ahroado We recommend,,however, that the existing anti-aircraft battery In india should he used for training additional personnel, whowould then he ready as soon as more equipment &quot;becameavailahle.8, As far as active air defence is concerned the most that could be advised at present is tihs provision, whenavailahle, of conversion sets to enable a small proportionof &quot;bomber aircraft to he converted into fighters 0     Thisquestion is already under discussion with the Government ofINDIA.RUSSIAN ADVANCE ON AFGHANISTAN.90 The authority of the Afghan Government is fairly well established in the Southern and Eastern Provinces of thecountry, but not in the north, where the inhahitants areracially akin to those of the Soviet Republic across theOxusg.     No action of ours could stop a Russian advance intothe Northern Provinces of Afghanistan, but such an advance would not directly affect the security of INDIA, except for a somewhat increased scale of air attack from aerodromes in afghanistan, provided Afghan authority was upheld south of the hindu-Kuslu     The danger of a Russian annexation of theNorthern Provinces would lie in the resulting loss of revenue and the possibility of the rapid spread of Communism to Kabuland Kandahar, leading to the disruption of the Afghan Government10.       It is to he noted that propaganda is the most potentweapon at present available to the Soviet Government and that the spread of such propaganda in India may lead to serious internal disturbances

-4-arising simultaneously with a Russian occupation of theNorthern Provinces of Afghanistan.    The Government ofIndia should take all possible measures to prevent the dissemination of such propaganda and to counter it bysuitable propaganda of their own.11.       A Russian advance south of the Hindu Rush we regard asa very remote contingency and.a step which would, in any case,require months of - preparation by the Soviet.22.       In the event of a Russian advance in the NorthernProvinces immediate action by us might save the situationin KABUL before it had deteriorated too far.    The decision as to what action should be taken would, of course, be one for His Majesty&apos;s Government to make at the time.    We thinkit advisable, however, to stress certain difficultieswhich would almost certainly arise:-(a) We would have no troops with which to support theAfghan Government, even if this were desirable.We could afford only diplomatic and economic help.(b) It would be difficult for us to give the AfghanGovernment any material assistance,  so long ascommunications between India and Afghanistanremain as bad as they are at present.    any improvement in the roads from Kabul to Pshawarand from Kabul through Kandahar to Quetta is ,therefore, to be welcomed.13.       In conclusion we would say that we do not think thepresent situation calls for any measures on our part to counter a possible Russian advance into Afghanistan, otherthan the maintenance of our present policy of friendlysupport of the Afghan Government.

A 7&apos;&apos;IMPROVEMENT OP OUR INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION INRUSBIAN TURKISTAN.14.       We fully endorse the opinion of the Secretary ofState for India that our Intelligence Organisation should be strengthened to deal with Russian Turkistan.    We doubt whether that field can be properly covered from Peshawarand Quetta where the present Government of India IntelligenceBureauxare located and recommend that the possibility ofestablishing an advanced Bnreau at Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharifor Herat be fully explored.    The difficulty of adopting   &apos; &quot;this course lies in probable Russian reactions. Theestablishment of a British Consulate at any of these places would probably result in  a demand by the SovietGovernment for the establishment of Russian Consulates atJalalabad, Ghazni and Kandahar, and it would be difficult for the Afghans to refuse such a request.    Alternativelyit might be possible to re-establish the Meshed Bureauwhich was shut down in 1936.15.        The question of sabotage is again one for detailed investigation by the Government of India.    The permanentways of the railways in Turkistan would probably be the most useful objective,  since the Russians have only two linesavailable, repair facilities are few and existing roads donot offer adequate means for the concentration of land or air forces.    We need hardly emphasise that no informationas to our intentions in this respect must reach either theRussians   or, until the occasion arises, the AfghanGovernment0(Signed)    0.1.IF.
