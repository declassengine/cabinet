Home Waters General.&apos;r\&apos;H.M.S7 &apos;Roytil:: Oak - was - torpedoed. - and sunk during the night theI3tK-14th October&apos; whilst at anchor in Scapa Flow. 810 lives were lost: this attack&apos;is believed&apos; to&apos;have; been the work of a U-boat which had penetrated theboom defences. No definite evidence in support of this theory has yet been produced, nor is it clear how the attacking craft entered and left (if she has yet left).2. The Polish submarine Orzel, which had escaped from Tallinn, arrived in the Firth of Forth on the 14th October.3. In, an air raid on the Firth or Forth on the 16th October,FOES. Southampton was hit by one bomb, which pierced the upper deck and passed out through the shipls side before exploding. ELM. ships Edinburgh andMohawk were hit by splinters and sustained slight material damage. casualties were as follows :-Southampton: 1 dead and 7 wounded.Edinburgh: 1 dead and 6 wounded.Mohawk: 16 killed, including the captain, and 44 wounded.FOES. Iron Duke, which is being employed as base depot ship at Scapa Flow,was damaged by two near misses in an air raid on the 17th October. Shedeveloped a heavy list but was safely beached. Casualties : 1 dead and 24 sufferingfrom slight shock.During the week two destroyers, Juno and Boreas, were bombed by aircraft in the North Sea without effect.Enemy aircraft were active in the vicinity of Scapa Flow on the 18th Octoberbut no bombs were dropped.4.   Seven armed merchant cruisers are now employed on the northern patrol.German Attack on Trade.5. The U-boat attack on trade has been renewed with increased vigourduring the week under review. The attacks, almost without exception, have takenplace in the Western. Approaches and well out in the Atlantic.The French tanker Emile Miguet (14,000 tons) was sunk on the 12th Octoberafter leaving her convoy on her own initiative. The behaviour of this ship&apos;s?eaptain prior to leaving Kingston, Jamaica, resulted in the route of the convoybeing changed at the last minute.On the 13th October an outward bound convoy was attacked shortly afterdispersal and the s.s. Heronspool (5,200 tons) was sunk. The s.s. Stonepool(4,803 tons) in the same convoy was chased, but escaped, and returned to harbourdamaged by gunfire.A homeward bound unescorted convoy from Kingston, Jamaica, was attacked on the 14tli October and two ships were sunk the s.s. Lochavon (9,205 tons) andthe French s.s. Bretagne (10,000 tons). The s.s. Karamea (8,457 tons) was shelledand chased, but escaped. She was not armed. The French tanker Louisiane(6,903 tons), which left this convoy at a dispersal point on the 12th October, was sunk at day break on the 13th October. The masters of both the Bretagne and consider they would have escaped if they had been armed, as thesubmarine attacked at close quarters and on the surface.An unescorted convoy homeward bound from Gibraltar was attacked onthe 17th October about 150 miles north-west of C. Finisterre with the loss ofs.s. Yorkshire (10,184 tons), the Commodore&apos;s ship, and s.s. City of Mandalay(7,028 tons). Three other ships in this convoy s.s. Sagaing, City of Guild fordand Gartbrattan were chased but escaped.6. In addition to the above-mentioned ships the s.s. Sneaton (3,677 tons)and the French s.s. Vermont (5,186 tons) have also been sunk by U-boats duringthe week.
The s.s. Imperial Star and Clan Macbean were attacked but escaped. Theformer, which is a 16-knot ship armed with a 6-inch gun. was twice attacked on the 17th and 18th October. The . s.s. Lough yjsls missed by a torpedo 30 miles. of Belfast on the 14th October. This was the only attack not in the western approaches. .   ..7. Three neutral ships have been reported sunk during, the week.; TheGreek s:sAris (4,810 tons) by a U-boat in the Western Approaches; the NorwegianLorentz. W. Hansen (1,918 tons) by U-boat or mine in mid-Atlantic; and theNorwegian Gressholm (619 tons) by mine N. of the Texel.8.   Losses of shipping by enemy action up to noon the 17th October were as follows : No. Tonnage.British    ............      ...      41 178,831Allied      ...............        5 38,972Neutral    .........      ...       ...      23 55.424Total       ............      69 273,327The rate of sinking as compared with the rate during the peak period in 1917works out at approximately 10 per cent, for numbers and 21 per cent, for tonnage.Anti-Submarihe Operations,9. Two 740 ton U-boats were definitely accounted for on the 13th October U 42 by H.M.S. Imogen in the Western Approaches, and U 40 by the DoverMine Barrage. Survivors were picked up in both cases. What was originallybelieved to be a third successful attack on the same day was subsequentlydisproved.Promising attacks were carried out by Eclipse on the 13th, Inglefield onthe 14th, and Inglefield and Ivanhoe on the 16th in the Western Approaches; byAfridi and Hastings on the 16th in the Firth of Forth; and by the 4th destroyer flotilla on the 18th off St. Abb&apos;s Head. Several other attacks have been carriedout without definite result. An attack by the submarine Sturgeon in theSkagerrack on the 14th October was probably successful.10. There are now sixty-two auxiliary anti-submarine trawlers and twentyanti-submarine yachts in commission.Convoys.11. Escorts of E. Coast convoys have been considerably strengthened, andcloser co-operation with Fighter Command arranged.French naval authorities have undertaken to provide escort for all convoysbetween gibraltar and the Western Approaches.Approaches,12. On account of the renewed U-boat activity in the Western Approachesoutward bound convoys have been ordered to keep in company for a further48 hours. It has been decided to revert to independent sailings in theMediterranean.13. The total number of vessels convoyed up to noon 17th October was1,642, consisting-.. Of 1,563 British, 67 Allied and 12 Neutral ships. Of this number 3 were sunk (this does not include the Yorkshire and City of Mandalay).The first Bergen convoy, escorted by a cruiser and four destroyers, crossedsafely on the 15th October.Mining.14.   One further lay is required to complete the Dover barrage.In all about fifty German mines have been washed up on the East Coast.;Many of these appear to have been laid by surface minelayers, and are of the[20165] b 2
. horned contact type. Information received from prisoners indicates that german submarines are laying a type of magnetic mine. Magnetic sweeps are now available.The German mined area in the North Sea has been extended to the westward, and two additional mined areas have been declared by them in theBaltic.&quot;Accidents.15. H.M.S. Amazon and s.s. Aractaca were in collision on the 18th October.There were no casualties.German Merchant Shipping.16. The Hamburg-America liner Halle (5,889 tons) scuttled herself offDakar, West Africa, on the 16th October to avoid capture by the French cruiserDuquay-Trouin.A German steamer carrying iron ore to Germany was reported aground onthe Swedish Coast on the 16th October. There have been reports of German ships in neutral ports attempting to disguise themselves as neutral ships, and furtherreports have been received of German ships from Atlantic ports returning toGermany via the Kattegat. In South American waters there seems to be a concentration of German shipping at Pernambuco.Economic Warfare.17. The total tonnage of cargo so far seized in prize in Great Britain is337,949 tons. Against this wTe have lost 148,150 tons of cargo in British shipsdestined for Great Britain, to which must be added some 30,000 to 40,000 tonsof cargo seized in prize by the enemy or sunk in neutral ships.MILITARY. SITUATION.Western Front.Opera-lions.18. From the 12th to the 15th October German operations were limited topatrolling and artillery harassing fire. During the night of the 15th-16th Octoberconsiderable movements were observed in the Merzig area, and in the early morning of the 16th the enemy launched an attack on a 4-mile front betweenApach and Mandern, on a sector which runs from the point of junction of theFrench, Luxemburg and German frontiers. The attack, which is believed to havebeen carried out by one division, was preceded by an hour&apos;s artillery preparation.It appears to have been made with the limited objective of gaining some&apos;high ground, known as the Schneeberg, which was occupied by the French andoverlooked the country towards Trier. The attack was opposed by advancedFrench elements only.During the afternoon of the 16th the Germans launched three further attacks on the Saar front, The first of these took place near Foret St. Arnaul and wasunsuccessful; the second on the sector between the R,. Saar and the E. Blies,and the third between the R. Blies and the R. Schwalb, to the south ofZweibrucken. On the morning of the 17th the enemy were active in the Warndtforest and Ohrenthal salient. In each case French advanced posts retired toprepared defensive lines.German Movements.19. During the period under revieAV the density of enemy troop movementshowed a decrease on the previous week. It should be noted, however, thatunfavourable weather conditions limited the amount of distant air reconnaissancewhich could be carried out, and troop movements may have taken place without being reported.
The distribution of enemy divisions on various sectors of the Western Frbntis believed to be as follows : Total       ......      .........      65      (89) 85(Note. -The disparity between the figures 85 and 89 is due to the identification-tion of elements of certain divisions in more than one sector.)It will be seen that the. main concentration remains in the Moselle-Saar-Rhine sector, with an important subsidiary concentration opposite the Limburgprovince of Holland. The increase in the number of Western Front divisions overlast week&apos;s totals is accounted for by the arrival of active infantry and mechanizedformations from Poland. One hundred and thirty German divisions in all havenow been identified.20. Considerable bridging activity has been reported. Many new pontoonbridges have been built, or are in process of being built, across the P. Rhinebetween Honnef (south of Bonn) and Nackenheim (south of Mainz) and on theR. Saar, in the region of Merzig.Further reports have been received of the accumulation of large quantities ofbridging material at Urgingen and Herzogenrath, both places close to the dutch frontier.21. The fortifications on the line Kaldenkirchen-Geldern-Goch-Kleve,which have until recently consisted of field works only, are being reinforced byconcrete constructions.In the Saar, considerable new work has been noticed on the defences, whichare chiefly anti-tank ones, south-west of Landsttjhl.Careful study of air photographs reveals that the Germans are building a third fortified line on the Western Front. This line, so far, consists of strong points only (including artillery and anti-aircraft positions) and extends from theAhr valley in the Eifel to Kaiserslautern, with an isolated post in the Kinzigvalley (Black Forest). The general line runs some twenty-five to thirty milesbehind the main line of defence.22. Several centres are reported to have been established behind the Germanlines for the special training of troops in attacking concrete emplacements.Large quantities of chemicals, gas and heavy calibre ammunition are said tohave been sent to the Western Front during the last week of September, togetherwith coast defence guns from East Prussia. Neither of the above reports has yetbeen confirmed.23. Swiss sources report that the towns of Karlsruhe, Merzig, Pirmasens,Saarbrucken, Zweibrucken, Saarlatjtern and Bergzabern have been whollyor partially evacuated by the civil population. Luxemburg sources statethat Monschau (south of Aachen) and German towns in the Moselle Valleyare being gradually evacuated.The British Expeditionary Force.24. As a result of intensive labour during the past week the permanentdefences of the British Sector have been greatly strengthened by field works.Soviet Russia.Russian mobilization.25. Weekly Resume No. 5 referred to a report of general mobilizationthroughout the whole of the U.S.S.R. Later information shows that mobilization-tion has probably been limited to Western and parts of Southern Russia.Another report goes so far as to say that demobilization of territorials inthe occupied parts of Poland and in White Russia is already taking place.Minimum. Maximum.North Sea Including Rheine       ...Excluding Rheine including AachenExcluding Aachen R. MoselleMoselle-Saar-Rhine,Upper Rhine  ......2 218 &quot; 2810 1323 2912 17[20165]
Earlier this year territorial formations were in the process of being turnedinto regulars, so that this report probably refers to recently mobilized reserve divisions. If so, the disbanding of such formations will not greatly affect themilitary preparedness of the country, for they are ill-equipped and their main-tenance is no doubt proving a burden to the transportation system:Congestion and disorganisation seem to have taken place already on the moscow-Leningrad railway and are reported to be the cause of the postpone-ment of the entry of Soviet troops into Estonia, which was originally due totake place on the 9th October, was then postponed to the 12th, and later tothe 18th.Soviet relations with the Baltic States.26. Reports of Soviet demands on Finland have varied considerably. Thereis little doubt that they include the use of the Finnish islands in the Gulf off inland itself, and that Finland would probably be prepared to meet such ademand. Further demands are said to include the use of the ports of Abo andHango, sites for a number of coastal batteries and aerodromes, and facilities onthe railways along the Gulf of Finland. The latest reports have not included theAaland Islands, but it is unlikely that they are entirely absent from the discus-sions. In spite of many rumours there is no confirmation of undue military activity on the Soviet side of the Finnish frontier, though peace-time formationshave been brought to war strength, and a new Corps Headquarters is reported at Petrozavodsk on the Murmansk railway.- It would always be easy, however,for extra troops to be drafted into the Karelian Isthmus from the Leningrad area.The Finnish authorities appear to be aiming at achieving the maximumdegree of military readiness before the resumption of the Soviet-Finnish talks.General mobilization is, in fact, taking place, though it has not been publiclyproclaimed. The General Staff hope to have 300,000 men under arms by the endof the week. Two armies, containing a total of eight or nine divisions, are tobe formed for the defence of the eastern and southern frontiers, the rest of thecountry being garrisoned by reservists; the morale of the troops is good, butthere is some shortage of equipment. A further report states that two Finnishinfantry regiments and a group of artillery were disembarked on the AalandIslands on the 13th October.A limited evacuation of Helsinki, Viborg, Tammerfors and Abo has beencarried out smoothly, and the ports on the Gulf of Finland have been closed to shipping.The. 6th Norwegian Division is reported by a reliable source to have beenmobilized and concentrated in the Alta area, near the Finnish border.27. The supplementary agreement concerning base areas and the transportof Soviet troops in Estonia was finally signed on the 10th October, and the latestdate received for the general entry of Soviet troops is the 18th, although no reports of their entry are yet to hand. Some advance parties, however, appearto have arrived at Baltic Port, Klooga and Haapsalu, which gives confirmationto previous reports that aerodromes and garrisons were to be established at thelast two places, although neither of them was mentioned in the published treaty.. The main Soviet forces to be sent into Estonia are said to be one infantry and one cavalry division with mechanical transport. It is reported that SovietGarrisons are to be stationed in Estonia (and Latvia) for the duration of the waronly. There seems, however, to be reason to doubt whether the Soviet would not look for, and find, some means to avoid implementing such an undertaking,especially as it has been reported that the Soviet Commissar made use of ailpossible ambiguities in the negotiations for the Soviet-Estonian Pact in an effort to obtain the right to station garrisons in the centre of Estonia.28. It is reported that, under the Soviet-Lithuanian agreement, the Sovietis to have many aerodromes in Lithuania and is to fortify the Lithuanian-german frontier, a suggestion which has come from several sources. 30,000 Soviet troops are to be stationed in the country. The Lithuanian authorities are said to be convinced that Soviet policy has a definite anti-German bias.Press reports state that the Soviet is to maintain garrisons at four places and aerodromes at three, but there is no confirmation of this.
Soviet activity elsewhere.29. The report in Weekly Resume No. 6 that eighteen Soviet divisions were concentrated on the Caucasian frontiers appears to be an exaggeration, as wassuggested at the time. Recent reports show that there may now be four cavalryand seven infantry divisions actually in the Trans-Caucasian Military District,which lies along the Turco-Soviet frontier.There are still considerable concentrations of Soviet troops suitably locatedfor action against Rumania. There are, however, no indications that such action is imminent, though there are signs that the Soviet press may be preparing theground for demands on Rumania. It is not unlikely that action in this area hasbeen postponed pending clarification of the Turkish attitude.Poland.30. Some units of the Polish army are apparently still resisting in areas such as the Suwalki salient, the Carpathians and the north-west part of thepinsk marshes, where the country is difficult.Italy.31. There has been no unusual military activity during the past week. a degree of partial demobilisation, possibly in the form of indefinite leave, is indicated.Serious deficiencies are reported in the armament and equipment of someformations.The Far East.32. There has been little fighting in China during the past week. Reportsof the withdrawal of Japanese forces from South China, possibly to reinforceCentral China, and staff arrangements in the latter area indicate that the Japanese-may recommence operations in the Yangtze Valley. In South China the japanese have put into effect their public announcement that they would withdraw from certain areas on completion of punitive operations north of Macao. Althoughmilitarily sound, this withdrawal has had an encouraging effect on the Chinese.33. The latest report received from Tientsin states that delays to british nationals are &quot; almost as bad as ever.&quot; Fundamentally, the anti-British attitudeof the Japanese army in North China has not changed.At Shanghai the commander of the United States forces has informed theBritish commander that it is considered inadvisable to send United States marinesinto the British defence sector in the western district of the city. This presentcautious attitude on the part of the Americans may be due to a desire to await a reply to the representations which have been made by the United States ChargedAffaires in Tokyo regarding the activities of desperadoes and &quot;officials &quot; ofthe Japanese-sponsored puppet regime in the area concerned. Nevertheless, it ispossible that United States marines would render assistance in a grave emergency in which American interests and nationals were threatened,*34. The Kulangsu dispute, regarding the safety of Japanese nationals inthe city, was settled on the 18th October by an agreement between the japanese and the Council of the International Settlement. American and Japanese marineshave withdrawn. The British and French sailors, who were landed at the sametime as the American forces, were withdrawn on the outbreak of the european war. The Japanese have now, apparently, been granted a share in policing theSettlement.AIR SITUATION.German Air Force.North Sea Operations.35. In addition to reconnaissance activity over the North Sea and the attacks on the destroyers Juno and Boreas, the German Air Force have carriedout three small bombing raids during the past week; one against naval units in* Note. In September the United States Naval   Commander-in-Chief   authorised the.American commander to send marines into the western district with the consent of the british commander, in the event of any serious emergency involving United States nationals.
sthe Firth of Forth a,nd the other two against naval units at Scapa. The raidon the Firth of Forth did not exceed twelve to fifteen aircraft, and was made upof personnel from a number of different units. It is possible therefore that itwas intended mainly, as a training operation to give experience to selectedpersohneland- to test out the&apos; strength of the defences. (The results of these attacks are described in thei naval paragraphs above.) .On the 17th, a German reconnaissance aircraft proceeded to the north foreland area, where it reported the number of ships lying in the Downs. it also :seht back a weather report. The aircraft then returned to Germany. Ithas been confirmed that there were a large number of ships lying in the Downsat the time.Western Front.36. During the afternoon of the 12th October, a DO-17 aircraft coming from the west flew over the region of Lyons at a medium height (6,500 feet) anddisappeared in the region of Nantua, and on the 17th October another aircraft was observed on the line Eesancon-Monibard-Chaumont. No other enemyreconnaissances were carried out over French territory.Location of German Air Force.37. Neutral sources have been active in reporting large-scale movements of the German Air Force. None of these reports have been confirmed, and it isbelieved that there have been no major changes during the past week.Air Defence of Great Britain.Defence of Rosyth.38. The raid on Rosyth on the 16th October was preceded by reconnaissance flights, which were attacked by fighters but succeeded in escaping into clouds.The enemy bombers flying singly or in pairs attacked between 1415 hours and1654 hours. They were engaged by the fighters and AA. defences, two enemy aircraft being shot down by fighters and two by A.A. fire. None of our aircraft were lost in this engagement.Defence of Scapa.39. The raid on Scapa on the morning of the 17th, which damaged theIron Duke, was by one squadron of aircraft. One aircraft was shot down. byA.A. fire and another probably damaged. In the afternoon there was a furtherattack by two formations, one of six and another of four aircraft. One Heinkelwas shot down.  Enemy bombs caused no damage in the afternoon attacks.Approach of Enemy Aircraft to East Coast.40. The following details of threatened enemy raids on the East Coast onthe 17th October were reported :  (i) Two raids were plotted approaching the Suffolk area. Fighters were despatched but failed to intercept. One of these raids did not cross the coast, but the other made a land fall at Southwold, and passedinland to Ipswich. AA. units engaged without success. The enemydropped no bombs.(ii) Four raids were reported to be approaching further north, but nonewere confirmed as enemy. Fighter patrols were despatched to investigate.(iii) Several enemy reconnaissances were plotted in the area betweenScarborough and Alnwick and fighters carried out a total of17 patrols. One of the patrols shot down an enemy aircraft 20 miles east of Whitby; another shot down one of the four aircraft whichhad attacked the destroyer Juno.   The crew were picked up by Juno.On the 18th, on receipt of further enemy plots off the East Coast, a numberof fighter patrols were carried out over the sea. One enemy aircraft was reported as down in the sea ten miles east of Kessingland.
JBovatiev Operations. ..Propaganda. &apos;   r&apos;&quot;. -:        &apos; ,     &apos;K &apos;41. On the 15th-l6th October seven bomber&apos;/aircraft left, this country to drop leaflets over Germany containing extracts from the speech made by&apos; thePrime Minister on the 11th October. Seven aircraft operated from england, butsix of them were compelled to turn back before reaching German territory owingto ice accretion; the seventh pilot reached Germany and reports that he droppedhis leaflets over the Berlin-Potsdam area, where he circled for half an hour.V ;two aircrafts of five which stood ready for a similar operation from an aerodrome in france started, but were recalled by wireless because of the unfavourable weather conditions; one of them came back, but the other failed to acknowledge the recall signal and has not returned.Six aircraft carried out a similar operation from this country on the night of the 18th-19&apos;th October and distributed leaflets over Hamburg, Hanover and bremen. Five aircraft returned safely to their aerodrome of departure arid oneforced landed in France.Reconnaissances of possible targets in the Ruhr.42. On the 13th October two aircraft operating from an aerodrome in Francereconnoitred specified objectives in the Ruhr. One of the aircraft returned with good photographs, obtained in spite of fighter opposition; the second aircraft &quot;didnot come back.Operations against the German Fleet.43. A striking force of bomber aircraft has been held ready to attack unitsof the German fleet found operating in the North Sea; no targets judged suitablefor attack have, however, been reported by reconnaissance aircraft.Air Component of the Field Force.44. Five Blenheim aircraft of the Air Component in France carried out a reconnaissance.of North-West Germany. Four returned to this country; the fifthis believed to have crashed in flames in Germanj&apos;, the crew being saved.Another reconnaissance was made on the 17th October between Munster and bremen.  Photographs were taken.Operations of Coastal Command Aircraft.45. Routine patrols, anti-submarine patrols, searches, reconnaissances andthe escort of convoys have been maintained daily. In addition to merchantshipping six German destroyers and a number of suspicious trawlers were sightedfrom the air during the week. Three submarines were attacked, but with whatresults is not known.Operations of French Air Force.46. Owing to unfavourable weather there has been very little air activityduring the week. Some reconnaissance flights were carried out in the SaarRegion, but with small results on account of bad visibility and in some cases onaccount of the activity of enemy fighters.
