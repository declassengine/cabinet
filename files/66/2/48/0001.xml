REPORT BY SIR JOHN MAFFEY OR HIS INTERVIEW WITHMRa DE VALERA ON THE S1ST OCTOBER, 1959*lo I was received &quot;by Mr, de Valera this morning atllo30 and remained with him for an hour and a halfoSo In accordance -with the instructions received inLondon, I approached Mr, de Valera on the subject of facilities at Berehaven.        His uncompromising answer to every line of approach was a categorical &quot;non possumus&quot;.In this attitude there was nothing anti-British, though he indicated more than once that if we had paved the wayto Irish unity, Ireland today might - only &quot;might&quot; - have&quot;been able to co-operate with us.3* The conversation began by my talking with Mr.de Valera listening.      I was able to bring out all the points in the case entrusted to me with full emphasis.      I toldMr0 de Valera that I came to him straight from the PrimeMinister Js room in the House of Commons,, that the wordswould not be mine but the Prime Minister^.     Mr0 de Valeralistened with keen attention, but I was talking to a manwhose mind had been made upe(In this record I am not repeating the argumentsused by me as they are already fully given in my brief.This record of the conversation may, therefore, appearone-sided.      In fact, it was not so).4. Mr., de Valera told me that he knew this issue wouldbe raised and that no adjustment of his view or of hisanswer was possible.       The creed of Ireland today was

neutrality,,     No Government could exist that departed fromthat principle.     The question of the ports was at the verynerve centre of public interest in that matter, and thepublic mood would react with intense violence to any actioninvalidating their integrity.     If a demand were made - he fully realised that no demand was being made - he would be forced at whatever cost to treat such a situation as a challenge, and his Parliament would endorse his measures0If, ea the other hand, facilities were voluntarily affordedin breach of neutrality, his Government could not live.     Infact, his Government could not attempt to put any suchconcession through and no other Government which mightendeavour to meet our request could survive for twenty-four hours.     He fully understood the cogency of all the argumentsbrought to support our request, but he had to deal with the,,matter from the practical point of view of what was possiblein Ireland, and in that regard there could be no question asto what the verdict must be.5. He would greatly regret a German victory.     Hissympathies were with the Allies, but if there was on thewhole, perhapsr a vague majority sentiment in favour of theAllies, any encroachment upon an Irish interest would create a swift swing over of opinion.     Many people inIreland were ready enough to acclaim a British defeat atany price, though that view might be based on ignorance.It had its roots in, history.6. No attempts to move Mr. de Valera from this position on the grounds of humanity, the practicaleconomic needs of Ireland in relation to sea-bornecommerce and her reliance upon our efforts, the danger-a-

of German success to which his people were not alive,produced any effect on a stance which had evidently beenfully studied and predetermined.7. In regard to the Convention of 1938 which settledthe fate of the ports, he maintained that there Gould havebeen no mental reservations on our side justifying any belief that Eire would adopt any particular course in theI event of a world conflict, I said that, nevertheless,such mental reservations had existed, and that the pathof generosity had been followed as an act of faith andin the belief that in the hour of need the hand of friendship would be extended.     He talked a good deal onthis point indicating in sum that we had no right to expect to derive advantage from what was not ours-     Sucha view would justify encroachment by Germany on Holland or belgium.     Moreover, he was certain that if the ports hadnot been handed over, the position for us today in ireland would have been one of grave friction and danger.(At this point In our conversation the telephonerang with an enquiry from the Kavas Agency, who asked for confirmation or otherwise of a rumour that facilities atthe ports had been demanded.     Mr,, de Valera at onceissued a denial.     This must have been a bit of quickguessing on the part of the press watching my recentmovements).8. I said that the decision he had to make was oneof immense gravity and that I hoped he would not give hisfinal answer here and now but that he would take time toconsider the matter in all its bearings in view of thePrime Minister&apos;s special approach to him.     The history ofIreland was one of lost opportunities.     Today the opportunity

list)lay with him.    Who could, see any hope fox4 a united ireland on the lines of our present conversation?   What BritishGovernment would eves surrender the ports of the Northafter this experience?    I asked him at one stage whether he was &quot;being quite honest with himself.    His country neededguidance amid new and unforeseen perils from a mind free from prejudice and ancient grievances.    Did he feel todaythat he could give that guidance?    He answered with duedeliberation and said that with an open mind he had workedover these issues again ana again knowing that the questionof the ports might arise at any moment, and. he and his ad-visers had always seen their course quite clearly whatever the draw-backs.    He knew and understood his people andhis problems, and he well knew that no other answer waspossible.    There would be no point, therefore,  in deferringan answer pending consideration,    I said that in view ofthe gravity of the issues, it seemed to me desirable-thathe should discuss the matter personally--With Mr, Chambe.r3ain,but he said that it wou.ld.be a pity to take this step,since it could not in any way alter matters.-.    His policy had been quite consistent0    His goal had been to maintainneutrality and to help us within.the Mmlts of that,neutrality to the full,extent possible.&apos;.      The measuresarranged with- me - in regard to information and liaison were all evidences of this, and of tho faat that he was beinghelpful, perhaps beyond the strict definition of neutrality.9, The discussion passed to more general lines,and Mr. de Valera again stressed his admiration for mr, Chamberlain, who, he said, had been genuinelyhelpful in regard to the Irish question.    In so far

as this tragic situation had developed, in Europe, he found himself in full agreement with everything that Mr. Chamberlainhad done,    I said that Mrc Chamberlain knew this andappreciated it, and this had e nc enraged him to send the message of which I was the bearer.    &quot;England.&quot;,  said.Mr. de Valera,  &quot;has a moral position today.    Hitler&quot;might have his early successes, but the moral, positionwould, tello    Any action against the Irish ports wouldshake our position of moral strength&quot;,    I said. &quot;Not ifhelp were voluntarily conceded.&quot;.    He replied &quot;No, but thatwould, stir up trouble which would quickly compromiseyour moral, position&quot;,10, He spoke -of the possihili-tie-s of peace and saidthat Hitler did not want war and that a.-reasonable-solutionembodying a partially restored Poland was to be had,    I asked by what agency0    He said that he thought italy might act through Mussolini,    That, today,,  seemed- theonly hope,    Roosevelt had,, he feared, put himselfcompletely out of court as an arbitrator-iowixig-to-hiainept letter of appeal and remons.te-an.coo11, Before leaving I said that his reply toMr, Chamberlain&apos;s request would cause deep and naturaldisappointmento    I added that in the ccairse of our conversation I had. necessarily to. reve-al to him certainvital facts regarding the position and strategy ofthe submarine campaign, and I must ask him to safeguardthat.infoWnetion, as knowledge of the Prime Minister&apos;request, the reasons for it and its rejection., would doharm to our cause.    He appreciated this but said naturally

3f3?the must report the substance of our conversation to hiscolleagues.    I pressed upon him the Importance ofmaintaining the greatest reserve in regard to informationlikely to prove helpful or encouraging to our enemies,and he undertook to do this0It is noteworthy that he had evidently expectedour request to be for facilities at Lough Swilly ratherthan Berehaven.Glearly he has had up to date informationof the recent movements of the Grand Fleet.(Int5d)    J.L.M..Dublin.21st October, 1959.

APPENDIX.INSTRUCTIONS FOR SIP JOHN MAFFEY.1. A glance at a chart of the Atlartiic will show how ships carrying trade from all over the world convergeto the southward of Ireland and the approaches to theEnglish Channel.2. In this area there are at any time more ships andmore valuable cargoes to be found than anywhere else in theworld.     These ships include not only those bringing tradeto England and Scotland, but also those bringing trade toIreland which is largely passed through Liverpool and otherEnglish West Coast ports and subsequently trans-shipped insmaller ships across the Irish Sea.3. Since the present war started, an   unrelentingU-boat attack has been taking place on this trade,  andthis attack has recently been intensified.      immediate measures were taken to put the shipping into convoy and toescort those convoys by anti-submarine craft.      The numberof ships available for escort work is, however, far belowthe requirement, and many ships and groups of .ships have tocome in unescorted because of the lack of these vessels.The recent threat of air attack on our East Coast trade hasalso made it essential to withdraw a number of escortingcraft from the &quot;Western Approaches.      Further, owing to thesame shortage of escorting craft, it is not possible totake the convoys out as far to the Y/estward as could bewished.      The U-boats have recently realised this weaknessdue to lack of escorting craft and they have been operatingfurther and further out to attack the ships when unescorted.4. Our patrolling aircraft are also a. most important

07 05  zJWeapon against the stibmarine, hut their range is limitedarid the submarines are now operating outside the areathat they can patrol*5a        It has now become imperative that we shouldescort our convoys both inwards and outwards to and from aposition further to the Westward;   working as we are fromPlymouth and Milford Haven it is impracticable to do this.Our destroyers and other escorting vessels have, since thebeginning of the war been running at their extreme capacity *Many of the vessels themselves are now beginning to show the signs of strain, and their crews are worked to theextremity of human endurance from lack of sleep and rest.It is not possible to produce  the extra destroyers andescort vessels to relieve the situation, and with thecoming of the winter months, and the far worse weather tobe expected compared to that which has prevailed since theoutbreak of war, the situation must go from bad to worseunless something can be done.       There is one way in whichthis situation can be relieved, and that is by the eire government permitting the use of a harbour by anti-submarineunits of the Royal iTavy and the Royal Air force     Berehavenis the most suitable harbour.6* The Southern coast of Ireland is by natureplaced in a position to control the approaches to theEnglish Channel, and with escorting craft and other craftbased on this port, it would be possible to escort our trade scores of miles further to the Ytfestward, therebyimmensely increasing safetye     Similarly, flying boatsoperating from this port can provide security by drivingthe U-boats under very much farther to the West than whenthey are operating from English portse   The suffering and

loss caused by the U-boats in the last six weeks have been serious^ but the comparatively fine weather that hasprevailed throughout this period has greatly reduced thetoll of humaii life0     With the winter months, this situationmust change j, and the chances of survival of the passengers and crew of any ship torpedoed in the weather that is to beexpected are very remotey**        Under the agreement of 1958 the rights of the UnitedKingdom under the Treaty of 1921 in respect of the defended ports in Eire were transferred to the Government of Eire,It is fully appreciated that that agreement was unconditional,,But there is nothing in the agreement to prevent theGovernment of Eire from according facilities to vessels of the Royal Navy to make use of Eire portse     The UnitedKingdom Government have always felt, and have indeed made it clear to the Government of Eire before and at the timeof the 1938 discussions, that in their view in a state ofemergency circumstances might arise which rendered itimperative, in the interests of both countries, that such facilities should be accordedo     These circumstances havenow arisen,.     For the reasons given above, such facilities are of vital importance in order to enable the Royal Navy to perform its function of protecting against attack trade whichis vital to secure the supplies required, not &quot;only in GreatBritain but also in Eire     There is no chance that, so faras Eire is concerned, such supplies can be protected byother means.     It is sufficient to refer to the activities ofGerman submarines in attacking neutral shipping of the scandinavian countries? including shipping destined forother neutral countriesr to prove that no shipping and. nosupplies for whatever destination are safe from attack.-9-

Moreover, although the problem now in.&quot;&apos;view is concernedwith trans-Atlantic shipping, the same considerations apply as regards the direct trade between Eire andGreat Britain, upon which the economic life of Eire is largely dependenta&apos;   80 It does not appear that any publicity need begiven to an arrangement under which Royal Navy vesselswould be authorised to make use of Berehaven as a portfor replenishing supplies and fuel and. for givingessential rest to personnel0     It might be urged that suchan arrangement would go &quot;beyond what has hitherto beenaccepted as the limit of neutral rights and duties, but any extension of this character could surely be justified on the need for securing protection for essential suppliesagainst illegitimate attack,90 Sir John Maffey is requested to bring the aboveconsiderations to the personal attention of Mr, de Valera,to urge upon him in such manner as he considers best the vital importance that the facilities mentioned should be accorded to the Royal Navy at Berehaven, and to do his utmost to secure this object0Dominions Office020th October; 19-39c^/Annexed to these instructions were anumber of detailed and historicalnotes not reproduced h.eres7
