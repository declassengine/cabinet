i&quot; a weekly RESUME (NO.4) OP THE NAVAL,  MILITARYAND AIR SITUATION J12 NOON 21ST SEPTEMBER TO.13 NOON 28TH SEPTEMBER)! &quot; \NAVAL SITUATION.Naval Operations.- . . . . &quot;10 During the week the outstanding incidents in home watershave heen those which arose from the escorting home of thedamaged submarine Spearfish.    On 26th September when returning from covering these operations the Home Fleet was engaged by enemy aircraft.    Three enemy flying boats shadowed the Nelson,Rodney and Ark Royalc    Fighters flown off by Ark Royal had some difficulty in finding the enemy aircraft, but all threewere engaged ,  one was damaged, and another brought down,This flying boat was later found by H.M0S. Somali, the crew of four were taken prisoners and the boat sunk.    Threeattacks were carried out  on the Ark Royal about 2e30 p.m.by single aircraft on each occasion.    No hits were secured inany attack.    A little later Hood and Repulse were attacked.The latter received a glancing blow from one bomb and the damage was superficial.    About half an hour later a high levelattack at 12,000 feet was delivered by aircraft attacking inwaves on        H0Mo  Ships Aurora and. Sheffield, which with fourtrihal destroyers were  escorting the Spearfish. Twenty sixbombs were dropped without effect,  the Spearfish reaching.the firth of Forth in safety on the morning of 27th September,Mining.2. On the 20th September a British mined area was declaredextending from the Humber to the Tyne, of an approximate width of20 miles and about 20 miles off the coast..-1-

Thus2,496 merchantmen of 14,600,000 are still available for tradingand cargo carrying.3e    The Northern part of the Dover Barrage is completed, and this in effect, covers the Channel from the Goodwins to the FrenchCoastal Channels.    The laying of the Southern part of the barrage has begun.4. The Minesweepers and Auxiliary minesweepers continue to search and keep clear the more important coastal Channels andApproaches to main harbours.    Many of the auxiliary minesweepersare still waiting to be relieved by properly equipped vessels which will probably be ready about the middle of October.British Shipping.5. During the week ending 1200 Thursday, the 28th Septemberfour British merchant ships were reported lost.    Two of these were sunk outside this period but their loss was not knownearlier.    The decline in percentage of loss is considerable, aswill be seen from the following tables-Percentageof total losses in period By Submarine  By Mine Total April.1917&apos; -        l?2.- &quot;Tonnage.

7e During this week 7,000 tons of wheat and other cereals and 8,900 tons of sugar destined for Great Britain were lost inBritish ships sunk by enemy action.    However, on balance for theweek the British net gain was 43,450 tons of assorted goodsintercepted from reaching the enemy, and since the war beganthe net gain is 121,350 tons,,    It may &quot;be noted that of this lastfigure 60,500 tons of fuel oil is included.    This counter-balancesthe 59,000 tons lost by enemy action and the net gain in iron,manganese and other mineral ores is 138,700 tons,80 The Royal Sceptre.    Thirty two survivors from this ship,which was sunk by a U-boat on the 5th September, have now been landed at Bahia in the British merchant snip Browning.Apparently the U-boat stopped the Browning after sinking theRoyal Sceptre and instructed her to search for the latter&apos;s boats0The Master of the Royal Sceptre was killed and nine of the crew,wounded by gun firs while abandoning shipeNeutral Shipping Losses,9. Four neutral ships of 6,963 tons have been sunk by german submarines either by torpedo or by the use of explosives? duringthis weekc    Previously,  in addition to one fishing smack tonnageunknown,  six neutral ships of 22,870 tons had been sunk, 5 by mine, one either by mine or torpedo, thus making a total ofapproximately   30,000 tons.80..        In the cases of one Swedish ship and two Finnish ships it isremarked that they were sunk in waters in which the German navy would have found little difficulty in bringing them into ports asprizes0    The cargoes of these ships were either cellulose or sawntimber,    neither of which are on the German contraband list, jjiany case this does not justi^y-tJae-^inking. of -a neutral ship andthere   is no case on record during either the last war or thepresent,  of the intentional destruction by the Allies of a neutralship.    There is no evidence that the German submarine Commanders

in these&apos; cases tried to ascei-tain and establish the nature of the -cargo the ship carried.Anti-Submarine. Operations,lle       Only twenty three attacks on U-Boats have been reported during this week,  three of which have been by aircraft.    It isconsidered that the submarine was definitely damaged in oneof the aircraft attacks 150 Sc S.W. of Ireland.    In two other attacks,  one by aircraft 70 miles southwards of Land&apos;s End andone by two destroyers off the Tyne, there are possibilities ofsuccess.    Two of the above three aircraft attacks were by flying boats from the Coastal Unit and the other was by a shore basedFleet Air Arm unite12.       Six commercial trawlers have now been fitted out for anti-submarine work and left their fitting out yards.    The work offitting out these trawlers is proceeding satisfactorily and.between 20 and 30 more should be ready by the 8th October.Convoys.130       Between 20 and. 30 convoyn are in operation throughout theworld. As this figure does not include a number of French convoys?it can be said that the convoy system it? almost in full operation.    In actual fact the complete cycle will start on the2nd October.14.       Up to date more than 700 ships have been convoyed inwardsand outwards without loss.    Among the ships convoyed so farthere have been 16 Allied and 4 neutral: merchantmen.-4-

15.        The ITorth German Lloyd-Steamer-Minden, 4165 tons,which left Rio de Janeiro on September 6th was boardedwhile in a sinking condition by RhlVhS,  Galypso about330 miles north west of Cape -Wrath on September 24th.Forty six members of her crew were taken off as prisoners.15,        Since the outbreak of war five German merchant ships of 23,649 tons have sunk themselves in order toavoid capture,      German merchant ships are moving aboutbetween South American ports and. three of them have leftPernambuco nominally for the Panama Canal en route forVladivostock0      It is believed, however, that they may betrying to make for Las Palmas, where the seadrome vesselOstmark is still reported active.      The SpanishAuthorities, however, profess to be assured that these activities are purely civilian and commercial.German-Navy.17.        The main German Fleet appears to be still in thevicinity of Wiihelmshaven.      A German Battle Cruiser hasbeen reported off Heligoland on the 23rd.      German naval units have been reported, in the area of the declaredGerman minefield on one or two occasions.18.        The German patrol in the Kattegat is reported to consist of fast motor boats in the Little Belt andtrawlers and old torpedo boats between the Skaw andMarstrand.      Daily air patrols are also carried out up&apos;the Sound and the Little Belt and. on the west coast ofJutland,,

19,       The German submarine activity during the past weekhas been principally directed against neutral shipping.It is estimated that at least seven large submarines havebeen at sea during the last week and may still he out.Italy.20.       Generally speaking there has been no apparentchange in the positions of the main squadrons.     Wirelesstraffic appears to remain at its normal level, activityis confined to local exercises and movements of escortingvessels, and submarines to and from colonial possessionsfor relief purposes.Japan.21.       ITo change has taken place in the generaldisposition of the Japanese Fleet.22.       The Russian invasion of Poland has so affectedopinion in Japan that negotiations for the direct or indirect purchase of German merchants ships are at a standstill..23.        In China the Japanese have not finally pressedtheir demand for the withdrawal of the forces ofbelligerents, but they are obstructing all movements ofgunboats and their stores on the Yangtze, and are in aposition finally to isolate them.U. S. S. R.24. Soviet Naval activities continue to be reported inthe Gulf of Finland.

\\25.        The escape of the Polish S/M Orzel from Tallinnproduced an immediate Soviet reaction.      Units of theSoviet Fleet have been.at sea searching for her forseveral days.26, A Moscow broadcast claims that the Russian Mine-sweeper Metallist has been sunk by an unknown submarinein the Gulf of Finland.27.        There is now reason to suppose that the Soviet ispressing Estonia to agree to the establishment of a russian naval base on the Estonian coast and to subjectEstonian foreign trade to Russian control.

MILITARY SITUATION.GERMAN WESTERN FRONT.General.28.       During the period under review the German armies haveshown little activity apart from local patrols and artilleryharassing fire.     Activity has been mainly confined to theair.     German efforts to dislodge the French from positionsthey have gained in the Saar area have been unsuccessful.Evacuation of certain villages in the Trier area bythe civil population has been reported, and in Aachen, inaddition to invalids and children, -plant and stocks ofcertain factories have, been transferred to less vunerable areas.Troop movements.29.       The number of divisions definitely identified in western Germany has increased during the last week from 1+2to 1+3, by the identification of a new division.      There hasbeen also a slight change in the location of these divisionsjone division from opposite the Dutch frontier and one or two divisions from the Trier area have moved to the area aboutAachen.In addition there are units opposite the Belgian andLuxemburg frontiers, which according to their numberingbelong in peace time to divisions which are believed, to havebeen engaged, in the fighting in Poland.      The Germans havebeen at great pains to conceal the identity of these units and. therefore it has been impossible to discover if they areactive or reserve.      Until this has been ascertained itcannot be established whether these units are advanced parties of active divisions to be moved from Poland to the Western

Front or whether they are reserve units which have never been in Poland,30,       Numerous reports have been received of the imminenceof a Gentian attack on Belgium and Holland, but on theevidence available it appears that there has been so far nolarg&apos;j scale transference of troops from Bast to West,     Thereare, however, the following troops within easy distance ofthe Belgian and Dutch frontiers(a) Twelve infantry divisions,(b) Elements of twelve other divisions, some ofwhich may be mechanized.,(c) Three to four tank regiments,  totalling 800 to900 tanks, north of Karlsruhe and presumablyavailable for operations.Fortification work.31.       Fortification work has been actively continued inthe following sectors of the German Western Defences:-(i) Opposite the Dutch frontier,(ii) Opposite the Luxemburg frontier,(iii) In the Saar sector,Communi ca ti ons.32.        Improvements to roads leading towards the dutch frontier have continued.GERMANY.Calling up of^personnel.33.        It is believed that personnel of classes which have so far not carried out any military service have now been called up for training,      A start has been made with the1911 and 1912 classes containing men of the classes which germany could not conscript because of the provisions of theTreaty of Versailles,

GERMAN EASTERN gRONTIER.General.3k.        German forces are reported to be withdrawingaccording to plan to the line of demarcation (see paragraph38 below),Troop movement(35,       The only confirmed troop movement reported on this front is the withdrawal to Prague of one Austrian division(kkth) which is known to have suffered numerous casualties in Poland,,36.        There have been, reports of considerable troop move--ments by rail from Sillein towards Bratislava and Vienna.No details of this movement are, however, yet known. Itis possible that some of these moves have been necessitated by the internal troubles in Bohemia and Moravia,POLAND.37.       The Polish Government and the Conuiander-in-Chiefentered Roumanian territory on 17th September.     Polishmilitary action daring the period under review has therefore been limited to the defence of the Warsaw area and of theHel Peninsula,  together with guerilla warfare- in other partsof the country.      Reports of 27th September indicate that negotiations for the surrender of Warsaw are in progress.Open opposition in Poland is unlikely go last much longer,except possibly in the Prypet marshes where the country is most favoxirable for the operation of guerilla bands.      the hostility of the Ukrainian and White Russian peasants towardsthe Polish governing classes should greatly facilitate thetask of the Soviet forces in cleaning up Eastern Poland.

SOVIET RUSSIA.Operations in Poland0380        It was announced on 23rd September that the Soviet andGerman Governments had agreed that the line of demarcation ,between thoir two armies should, be from Forth to South:-The River Pissa up to its confluence with the River Narew,thence along the Narew to its confluence with the River Bug,thence along the Bug to its confluence with the Vistula,thence along the Vistula to its confluence with the River San,,and thence along that river to its source.      This line of demarcation does not, however, necessarily represent thefinal political solution.39.        In their advance towards this line the Soviet forces have encountered, very little resistance.      The latest Sovietcommunique states that on 2bth September their troops had reached the general line:- Suwalki-Osoviec-Brzesc-Cheln-Zamosc-Rawa Russlca-Sambor.It is generally agreed, that about 30 infantry divisions,12 cavalry divisions and 10 mechanized brigades are atpresent operating in Poland.Activities in the North.hG.        It was reported on the 22nd and 23rd September that17 military trains left Leningrad for Murmansk.      TheNorwegian Government are said, to be apprehensive of anattack against Norway across Finnish territory, which nearMurmansk is only 20 miles wid.e at its narrowest point.      Thereare however, no Norwegian objectives of any importancewithin striking distance of Murmansk and. it is more probablethat these movements were precautionary measures to strengthen the defences of Murmansk in view of the possibility ofhostilities with Great Britain.

Activity on the Baltic States Frontiers.hi.       Reports indicate considerable military activity inthe neighbourhoods of Kingisepp, Pskov, Vitebsk, andPolotsk.Activity on the Roumanian Frontiers.h2.       Reports of considerable military activity along theRoumanian frontier have been received.     The existing Sovietfortifications are apparently being strengthened, and agentsare reported to be actively collecting information about the communications on the Roumanian side.Soviet Mobilisation.43.       It has been officially announced that those called upfor service during this month will be considered asmobilised until further notice.      This means that the SovietGovernment will have ready mobilised some 70 to 80 divisions in ad.dition to those engaged, in Poland.BALTIC STATES.Estonia.44. .     Reliable reports of Soviet troop concentrations near the Estonian frontier, combined, with an outburst of anti-Estonian propaganda in the Soviet press, have caused considerable anxiety as to Russia&apos;s intentions,  in spite ofthe Soviet Governments recent reiteration of its intentionsto respect the neutrality of the Baltic States.      Estoniahas not, however,  ordered, any general mobilisation.Latvia.45.        The influx of Polish refugees has ceased, since theLatvian-Polish frontier was closed by the advance of theSoviet troops.There is at present no confirmation ofa report that theU.S.S.R.  intends to occupy the Daugavpils area which controls the railways to Riga and Wilno.

Lithuania.1+6.        Contact with Soviet forces has been established along the greater part of the frontier.      It is reported fromLithuania that relations between the two armies are cordial,ROJJMANIA.1+7.        There are no important changes to record in thegeneral situation as given in Weekly Resume No.3.     Thepossibility of having to meet an attach from Russia had caused the Roumanians to construct a few hasty field defencesin Bessarabia at the end of August.      The change in thesituation since that date has apparently led. to a decisionto construct a further line of defences.BULGARIA,1+8.        There appears to have been no recent increase in thestrength of the Bulgarian Army, which has not yet exceeded50% of its war strength.      Bulgaria continues to receiveconsiderable quantities of war material from Germany.TURKEY.1+9.       Rumours have been current that considerablereinforcements,  amounting to about two army corps, have been moved, from Anatolia to Thrace.      No confirmation has beenobtained, and. the 2nd Army Corps is believed to be still in western Anatolia.YUGOSLAVIA.50.        The strength of the Yugoslav Army continues to increase and. it is thought that the nucleus of some reserve divisionsmay have been formed..GREECE.51.        The actual measures to be taken as a result of therecent Italo-Greek accord, have not been announced..      It seems

probable that they will not be brought into full effect in greece until some time in October,,ITALY.Troop MoveSo52,       The only troop movements worthy of note are minorreinforcement of the land frontiers, which may, however, be either simply reliefs or alternatively the replacement as a precautionary measure of formations sympathetic to nationals of neighbouring powers,New formations.53.       There is still no confirmation of the duplication offormations located in Albania,      Meanwhile there are indications that a new division, which was down to be formedafter the re-organization of the Italian Army towards the endof 1938, may now be located in Sardinia.      Some additionalAlpini battalions have been formed,Libya.5k.        It appears probable that the   reinforcement of Libyamay now have been completed.      The explanation of the increase^which is officially stated to be a defensive measure in viewof the French concentration of troops in Tunisia and not a threat against Egypt, appears probable,Albania.;ft3;;.\;vfejf f&apos;&quot;v-;h55.       The withdrawal of Italian forces from the immediatevicinity of the Greco-Albanian frontier is confirmed.      A.report that one or two formations had returned to Italy has notbeen confirmed, but there are definite indications that reliefsof personnel may be in. progress.

Dodecanese.56.       According to Italian official information theArmy garrison consists of one infantry division at war strength and the despatch of extra units or formationshas been denied.      It seems probable, however, that military units of the garrison are maintained at a strengthbetween 20% and 5Cf  above the normal war establishment.Italian East Africa.57.       Some black shirt units are believed, to have beenrepatriated, coring the first half of the month,     Thegeneral situation remains unchanged.Generala58.       Although defensive measures have been completedthere is reliable evidence that some reservists recentlycalled up have been permitted, to return home, leave hasbeen granted to soldiers for seasonal agricultural work,and. some impressed, animals and vehicles have been returnedto their owners.      It is also reported, that some anti-aircraft personnel (militia) have been discharged..      Ingeneral,  the military measures appear to have been some-what relaxed.IRAN.&apos;59.       Iranian posts on the Soviet Caucasian frontierhave been reinforced as also on. the Southern Iraq, frontier and in the oil area. 1CHINA.60.       Major operations have developed, in central Chinaduring the past week.

6f*0Following recent operations in northern Kiangsi,which appear to have been in the nature of a diversion orholding attack,  the Japanese on 22nd September launched an offensive further west, in northern Hunan.      The objectof these operations may be confined to inflicting a heavy defeat on the Chinese forces in north east Hunan(estimated at approximately 100,000 men) or may beextended to the capture of Changsha, the provincial capital and an important road, rail and river junction.     Japanesenaval units, operating on the river approaches, arealready reported to be within 25 miles of the city.The operations, whilst giving active expression to japan&apos;s determination to concentrate her main effort onfinishing the China campaign, are probably designedpolitically to impress the Chinese with the futility offurther resistance and to influence waverers among theChinese leaders to side with the &quot;puppet&quot; government of occupied China which they are hoping to proclaim.Meanwhile underground activities for peace are not beingneglected by the Japanese.6l.       The Press reports renewed fighting in the Cantonarea.      The situation at Tientsin shows some improvement,whilst at Shanghai the Japanese have not pressed their&quot;friendly advice&quot; for the withdrawal of foreign garrisons.In Manchuria notwithstanding the Russo-Japaneseagreement to cease operations on the Mongolian-Manchurianborder, Japan is still taking precautions.      There arereliable reports of several thousand troops landedrecently in the Port Arthur-Dairen area.      It seems probablethat these troops have been sent direct from Japan, as thereare no indications that the strength of the Japanese forcesin China has been seriously reduced.

AIR. SITUATION.Distribution, of the German Air. Force.62.       During the last week of August the Germansreinforced their North West area by 400 long range bombers, bringing the total bomber strength withinimmediate striking range of this country up to about850 aircraft.      Since 1st September, they have graduallywithdrawn these reinforcements and about 12th Septemberseveral Gruppe moved to the East.It is interesting to note that this move coincided with reports from neutral sources that the Germans hadtransferred a whole air division from East to West.A further reduction of the air strength in the N.W,area took place about the 17th September, and was againaccompanied by circumstantial reports of a largeconcentration of German bombers in the West in preparation for air attack on England.     The last ofthe reinforcing units have now been identified at their home stations in South Germany, and the long rangebomber force in the N.W. area is back to its peaceestablishment of some 460 aircraft.63.       There is no reason to suppose that the return of these units indicates more than the desire to carryout the necessary maintenance, which must now benecessary on aircraft which have been operating in the open for a month.      Moves back to the North-West areacan be made in a few hours, but it is normally some days before the signs of such a redistribution are sufficientlysure to amount to confirmation.

The Germans have undertaken no bombing operations against objectives behind the French line, and there hasbeen only limited activity in their reconnissance and fighter operations on this front.Italian Air Force.64.       No fresh moves of squadrons have been reported-.U.S.S.R. Air Force.65.       Reports indicate that the Russians have two groups of air forces in Northern Poland and anothertwo Groups in Southern Poland.Operations by French Air Force.66.       French aircraft have made day and nightreconnaissance flights behind the Siegfried Line.     Theaircraft were old types and they have not been wellmatched against modern German fighters;   up to the 18thSeptember the French had lost eleven aircraft.     Theyhave brought down two German fighters, one, which isof latest type, having been secured intact.     We haveno reports of any French bombing operations.ROYAL AIR FORCE OPERATIONS.Reconnaissances in North-West and Western Germany.67.       A number of daylight reconnaissances have beenmade by Bomber Command units in England and by the advanced Air Striking Force in France.      Roads and railways leading from N.E. Germany to the West, the areabehind the German line, aerodromes and balloon barrageshave been reconnoitred.&apos;

. Enemy fighter opposition was slight, and,although on certain flights anti-aircraft fire has beenintense up to 23,000 feet, in general it has not beenaccurate.      We have, suffered no losses,Operations against the German Fleet.68.       A force of 12 Hampden aircraft made a reconnaissance of the Heligoland Bight to attack german naval surface vessels which might be observed in thatarea0j     No suitable targets were found.Propaganda.69.        The War Cabinet at their 17th Meeting decidedthat leaflet dropping should be continued, not -necessarilyat regular intervals but when thought desirable,      Duringthe period under review leaflets were dropped on two occasions during reconnaissance operations.70.        It is expected that a balloon unit, which islocated in Prance for the despatch over Germany of propaganda leaflets attached to balloons, will be ready for operations within a few days.Naval Co-operation,-71.       Routine patrols,  searches,  convoy patrols, specialreconnaissances and intensive anti-submarine patrols,particularly in the Western Approaches have been maintained throughout the week.      Seven enemy aircraft have been sighted during the.last four days resulting in four combats.      One flying boat was compelled toland in Iceland and was interned.
