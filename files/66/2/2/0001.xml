(39) 52.TO^BE^EPT UNDER LOCK AND^KEY^It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.NOTES ON THE GENERAL SITUATION.1.   I AM anxious to place my view upon the present changing- situationbefore my colleagues in a complete form.2. Although the Russians were guilty of the grossest bad faith in therecent negotiations, their demand made by Marshal Vorosshilof that russian armies should occupy Vilna and Lemberg if they were to be allies of Poland,,was a perfectly valid military request. It was rejected by Poland on grounds which, though natural, can now be seen to have been insufficient. In the resultRussia has occupied the same line and positions as the enemy of Poland, whichpossibly she might have occupied as a very doubtful and suspected friend. Thedifference in fact is not however so great as might seem. The Russians havemobilised very large forces and have shown themselves able to advance fastand far from their pre-war positions. They are now limitrophe with Germany, -and it is quite impossible for Germany to denude the Eastern front. A largeGerman army must be left to watch it. I see General Gamelin puts it at at.least twenty divisions. It may well be twenty-five or more. An Eastern frontis therefore potentially in existence.3. But it is possible that a South-Eastern front may also be built upin which Russia, Britain and France will have a common interest. The leftpaw of the Bear has already closed the pathway from Poland to Rumania.Russian interest in the Slavonic peoples of the Balkans is traditional. the arrival of the Germans on the Black Sea would be a deadly threat to Russia.And also to Turkey. That these two countries should make common cause toprevent this is a direct fulfilment of our wishes. It in no way conflicts withour policy towards Turkey. It may well be that Russia will deprive Rumaniaof Bessarabia; but this does not necessarily conflict with our major interest,which is to arrest the German movement towards the East and South-East ofEurope. Rumania which gained enormously from the late war, in which shewas rescued from utter defeat by the allied victory, will be lucky if she gets,out of this war with no greater losses than Bessarabia and the southern part of the Dobrudja, which latter she ought willingly to cede to Bulgaria inthe interests of a Balkan bloc. The reactions of the Russian movement so faras it can at present be judged should be favourable throughout the balkans and particularly in Yugo-Slavia. Thus besides the&apos; potential Eastern front, a potential South-Eastern front may be coming into existence, reaching in acrescent from the Gulf of Riga to the head of the Adriatic and thence perhaps onacross-the Brenner to the Alps.4. Of course we should much prefer that all these countries should fallat once upon the sole and common foe, Nazi Germany; and this possibility shouldnot be excluded as time goes on. It would come very near if Germany struckthrough Hungary at Rumania, and to a lesser degree if she struck at Yugo-Slavia. The policy we are pursuing of fostering this front, of strengthening it[20034]
and endeavouring to throw it into simultaneous action should any part of itbe attacked, seems absolutely right. This policy implies a renewal of relationswith Eussia as the Foreign Secretary has swiftly foreseen. It also compels ouradherence to the policy declared by the Prime Minister of not committing ourselves to.particular territorial solutions, and concentrating the whole effort of Britainand France upon smashing Hitlerism, and also of making sure that the GermanTerror: is not renewed upon the Western democracies for a long time to come..This last point which appeals so much to the French is exactly expressed by thePrime Minister?s words : &quot; Our general purpose .... is to redeem Europe fromthe perpetual and recurring fear of German aggression, and enable the peoples of Europe to preserve their liberties and their independence.&quot; This cannot be repeated too often or too widely.:5. Upon this general appreciation our handling of the Turkish negotiationscan more easily be considered. I cannot feel that there is the same urgency about them as there was when Hitler was reported to be about to invade Rumaniawith twenty-eight divisions, &amp;c. It now seems possible that that man may be warned off his Eastern career- but of course he may renew his threat at anytime, and we besides have a main interest in bringing all the Balkans and eastern front into hostile action against Germany. Neutrality so formidable asto be unmolested, is a great deal; but hostile action is what is needed to preventthe whole strain being thrown upon the &quot;Western front. It therefore seems mostimportant to make the Turkish Treaty. At present there are two treaties thesham one which has some diplomatic value, but imposes no obligation uponTurkey; For this we should pay something, but not too much. But I wonderwhether, if the Turks come back from Moscow with good news, i.e., with news inthe general tenour of these notes, we might not be able to get the real treaty by adding to what we have promised already, the support of a French army corpsfrom Syria and a British contingent from Egypt, to be sent to the aid of Turkeyif at any time she was drawn into war through fulfilling her obligations toRumania. . This would seem to be in the general line of the French ideas.Nothing could be worse than that they should go to Salonica. Nothing could bebetter than that they should go to Constantinople. It is suggested that, in spiteof Russian complications, this line might be explored.6, If it should turn out that Hitler is barred in the East; which, of course,is not yet certain, three courses are open to him : (1) A major attack on the Western front, probably through Belgium,collecting Holland on the way.(2) An intensive attack by air upon British factories, naval ports, &amp;c, or perhaps on the French air factories.(3) What the Prime Minister calls &quot; the peace offensive.&quot;Personally, I shall believe that (1) is imminent only when at least thirtydivisions have been concentrated opposite Belgium and Luxemburg. As to (2),it seems a very likely thing for that man to do; but he may not do it, or he maynot be allowed to do it by his generals, who now are presumably more powerful,for fear of making a mortal blood-feud with Great Britain, and perhaps drawingin the United States by the air massacres which would be inevitable. as for (3) : if he has not tried (2), it would seem our duty and policy to agree to nothing that will help him out of his troubles, and to leave him to stew in his ownjuice during the winter while speeding forward our armaments and weaving-up our alliances. The general outlook, therefore, seems far more favourable thanit did in the autumn of 1914, when a large part of France was occupied and russia had been shattered at Tannenberg.But there always remains No. 2.   That is the immediate pinch.W. S. C.September 25, 1939.
