3 iFinancial Secretary to the Treasury :x. We are reporting to you as members of a Conference corx-intervened by you on behalf of the Government to consider theproblem of compensation to owners of private &quot;propertydamaged by enemy action. In lieu of definite terms of refer-ence, we decided to take as our instruction the letter sent by theChancellor of the Exchequer to each of us in which he not onlyoutlined the general situation including the Governments de-clarations of policy, but also stated that we were to examinethe practicability of evolving any scheme for mutual protection against risk of war damage to fixed property in private owner-ship, excluding ships, cargoes, and commodities, which -arealready covered by the Governmenfs insurance schemes. he went on to say that the Government must maintain the viewthat no scheme could be acceptable which would promise toprovide an unlimited amount out of public funds for compen-sation, and that the object of the enquiry was to examine any suggestions that might be made consistently with that essential condition. If a practical scheme could be evolved, it would notnecessarily be rejected merely because it involved some Govern-ment contribution of reasonable and asoertainable dimensions.The Conference were also asked to advise whether participa-tion in any scheme which they thought it practical to recom-mend should be compulsory on all property owners or whetherit should be voluntary. The day by day proceedings of the Con-ference would have to be confidential, but when the time comesthe Government would be glad to consider how far the conchi-sions of the Conference could be published.2. When the Conference was convened the country was atpeace. Now it is at war, and the Governmenfs plans are being laid on the basis of a three years&apos; war. We feel it essentialthat our report should be presented with all speed. Accord-ingly, this report has been prepared in a severely practicalform and with the minimum elaboration. Having recited what we are asked to do, our first step is to set out as shortly aspossible the situation as we find it.In October, 1936, the Committee of Lloyd&apos;s followed the example of the Insurance Companies in refusing to accept in-surance against war risks to property, and shortly afterwardsthe President of the Board of Trade announced in April, 1937:&quot; After careful review of all the circumstances, the Govern-ment reached the conclusion that no scheme of insurance ofproperty in this country against war risks on land would be appropriate to the conditions of a future war so far as theycan be foreseen to-day. In the opinion of the Government themost effective form of protection against air raid risks lies inthe effective prosecution of their present programme of rearmament -ment.  If, however, the conditions arise which any scheme of20499 A a
insurance would be designed to meet, it will be for the Govern-ment of fee day to consider making to owners whose propertyhad suffered damage such compensation as may be possible atthat time,&quot;In April, 1937, an interdepartmental Committee was setupby the Cabinet to consider the implications of a scheme for com.compensating the owners of private property damaged in war,This Committee reported in June, 1938, and on its recommendtions subsequent Government policy and action have been largely based.3. The Government Scheme. The following represents in itsbroadest outline the Government scheme as indicated toParliament:  (a) They accept the principle that&apos; the loss ought notto be left to lie where it happens to fall. They regard therisk as one which affects the whole community, and theparticular person or particular property which is struck asthe casual ^victim of a general peril.(6) Accordingly they adopt the principle that the burdenmust be placed on the broadest back and that the com-munity as a whole should bear the burden of compensation.(c) This compensation should be on the highest scalecompatible with the circumstances of the country after and Inot before a conflict.(d) This compensation will be made from public funds Iand in accordance with a scale which would at any rate Ipay in full up to a certain limit of loss, and thereafter would be graded.(e) Damage should be recorded and assessed as early as \possible after its occurrence, and the administrative\machinery to deal with this should be created at once.(/) It is recognised that certain sections of the general problem require special urgent treatment, in particular:-fi(i) Questions   affecting   the   contractual  relations T-between    freeholders,     leaseholders,     mortgagors,!mortgagees and other persons interested in property, ff(This has been dealt with by legislation so far as the hwar period is concerned.)(ii) The necessity for providing without delay for lie jlrepair and restoration of certain classes of fixed:property including housing essential to the conduct d \the war.   (Legislation has been passed to deal wiihfcthis.)Marine risks and stocks of material and material in progress,have been dealt with under the War Risks Insurance Act and^
the particular field of private property with which this Confer-ence is to deal embraces fixed property, plant, equipment, andfurniture under private ownership.a. In Parliament, in the Press, and elsewhere a measure ofdissatisfaction with the Government scheme has been expressed.Complaint is made that the scheme is too vague and indefinite,and that it is not understood why a mutual scheme of insurancecannot be devised. Apprehension is expressed that confidenceamong property owners will sink to a low level carrying with itharmful repercussions. In view of this dissatisfaction theGovernment convened this Conference. Accordingly we inter-pret our duty as involving us in commenting on the government scheme as well as advising specifically on the practicability ofany scheme for mutual protection, and, if such, a scheme befound practicable, whether it should be compulsory or voluntary.5. In examining this problem we have had in front of us the relevant Government papers together with a large number ofschemes arid suggestions which have come from representativeassociations and individuals, to all of whom we are indebted.Further, we have had the advantage of considering the views of,and discussing the problem and many of the schemes with,Government officials and representatives of varying interestssuch as Building Societies, the Co-operative Movement, theAssociation of British Chambers of Commerce, the Federationof British Industries and others. In the evidence put beforeus in regard to dissatisfaction with the Government scheme,we are impressed by the almost universal appeal for somescheme which will strengthen confidence and give an addedfeeling of security. We feel bound to say, however, that theredoes not appear to exist amongst these various representative bodies uniformity of view as to the precise nature and scope ofthe scheme that they would have the Government adopt or full: appreciation of the scale and implications of this and other problems which may have to be dealt with after the war.Accordingly, we make our comments fully realising the im-portance of anything which will yield an added sense of security.It is essential, however, that such sense of security should bewell-founded.;We&apos; would say at once that emerging from all our investi-. gations has come the conviction that the problem is much moreone of broad principle than of detail, and it is our hope thatthe usefulness of our, Report will rest mainly on the implications-tion of our comments on the Government scheme and the other schemes and not on any detailed analysis of these schemes..6. The essence of the Government scheme is that it proposes1; to place the burden of providing compensation for loss on theI broadest back,&apos;that of the community as a whole. The essence20499 a 3
of all the other schemes and suggestions is that this bwhole or in part should be placed On the back of the property owners as a section of the community and such schemes are all based on the assumption that this back is broad enoughto carry the burden.   Implicit in practically every such schemesuggested is the idea or conception that the principle ofjnumality among property owners possesses some distinct meritof which the Government scheme neglects to take advantage.This difference of opinion seems to us to constitute the coreof the whole issue, and we regard it as arising from a differ-ence of outlook in regard to and appreciation of the picture ofour national situation as it may be at the end of this war, awar which we will win through the effective utilisation of all our resources.   Any such picture of what the Government ofthe day and the nation will have to face after the war must inevitably be one in which practically every important elementor factor is to-day entirely indefinite and incalculable.   Intothis picture there must enter such problems as the planning of reconstruction of damaged property and even areas of pro-perry.   Probably some of this in the future national interestwill not be replaced either in its existing form or location. Thevalue put on this property to-day may not necessarily afford a reliable indication of its ultimate replacement cost.   On theother hand some classes of undamaged property may have in-creased in value owing to the fall in purchasing power of moneythat so often accompanies war and to high costs of replace-ment.   Other classes of property, particularly certain indus-trial buildings with their equipment, may decrease in value.Into the problem will enter questions of priority in labour,material, and finance for reconstruction.    There will be the difficult question of the ultimate relationship of mortgagor andmortgagee in regard to damaged property. There will be claims for compensation to meet many varieties of loss and hardshipnot only in connection with losses of fixed property but alsoover an obviously wider field.   Only one thing is clear, andthat is that the Government of the day and our people willtogether have to set to and restore the damaged capital assets of the country.   If this is an outline picture of the conditions at the end of this war, then in our view this is not the timeto fix with any rigidity the exact means and methods by whichthe great task should be discharged.   The factor of damagedproperty and its compensation will be merely one of manyclaims on the national resources available after hostilities, andto-day the character and magnitude of both claims and re-sources are unpredictable.    In regard to fixed property theaverage damage created per ton of bombs dropped is indefinite; the tonnage of bombs dropped per unit of time&quot;&apos;equally indefinite, and the length of the war is also indefiniiIt is of course possible to make hypothetical assumptions
these indefinite factors, and we have had before us materialpreparfed by the Service authorities. at an early stage in theGovernments investigation of the general problem. This wehave had reviewed and re-examined in the light of to-day&apos;sconditions. We are not in a position to contest either the assumptions Or the figures, but we can say that they renderany scheme based on any recognised insurance principle quite impracticable. It is this consideration as to the possible andindefinite extent of risk which has led those carrying on thebusiness of insurance to decline to regard the risk as an insur-able, proposition.The conflict of outlook to which we have referred as representing the core of the main issue consequently leads tothe demand that the Government should commit themselvesnow to a definite plan to be applied after the war; on the otherhand the Government say, we think with wisdom, that theymust preserve freedom of action until they have the wholepicture in front of them. The Government clearly feel that,having accepted responsibility for compensation, and havinggiven the promise to meet this by putting the burden on thewhole community after the war, they must decline now to tietheir hands by defining any particular method by which theywould impose the final burden on the community. Anymutuality scheme either independent of, or complementary to,the Government scheme, also involving either premiums paidby property owners during the war, or annual levies after thewar, appears to constitute an unjustifiable earmarking bothduring and after the war of one section of national resources for one particular objective. If this earmarking possessed anyspecial merit it might well be considered, but we are bound toconfess our inabihty to see it in any other light than impairingthe freedom of the Government to discharge in the best way inthe light of the post-war picture the ultimate responsibility theyhave assumed.From these considerations, it would appear that no schemeof mutuality could be safely embarked upon by the property owners to meet full capital loss. Just as the Government arein the presence of the ; unknown, so are they. If theGovernment representing the whole nation shrink from tyingits hands now in regard to method, how much more should alimited section of the community pause before shoulderingburdens which they cannot measure and which experiencemight well prove they were unable to bear.7- We will now refer to what might appear to be an incon-sistency in the Governments plans for dealing with various classes of property. Having accepted the principle that eofn-pensation for fixed property must be made by the community as a whole, that mutual insurance is impracticable, and that
little can usefully be done until the end of the war as regardsthe means and methods of imposing the new burdens on thecountry, the Government have as a matter of fact selected:jcertain other classes of property and have put intopractice mutual. insurance schemes for these classes. these schemes apply to marine risks and to stock and material inprogress. In addition, the Government propose to lend Statefunds during the war for the repair and reconstruction ofdamaged fixed property including housing essential towards the effective maintenance of the life of the community- in war-time.We think the answer to this apparent inconsistency: should beobvious, and its adoption regarded as justifiable. The deter-mining factor in this instance is that such property must bereplaced to enable the war to be carried on. In, the case of marine risks there does exist experience on which to build an insurance scheme. The magnitude of the total risk is small corn-pared with that of fixed property, and the war requires that ships be kept in commission and that they be renewed. - In thecase of commodities and materials in progress, broadly thesemust be renewed and replaced to enable the country to carryon. Here the nature of the risk is to some degree analogous tothat of fixed property, there being no past experience as a guide, and the possible damage runs into high figures. Accord-&apos;ingly, the Government compulsory insurance scheme for com-modities and material in progress discloses in its- practical application some indication of the realities of the risks expressedin the magnitude of the premium and the short period whichit covers. It is of course true that the payer of the premiumscan perhaps pass on the cost of insurance to, the consumer of the product, but the high premium rate and the short period haseven now become the subject of grave anxiety;and concern in-industry and among consumers:      &apos; -    - - - 1The only justification for adopting to-day this type of insurance scheme is, as we have said, the necessity for replace-ment or repair or restoration at once for war purposes. It is,however, much more a compulsory levy&apos; on owners of&quot; thisessential type of property than an insurance scheme and the incidence of the levy is spread through increased prices iri ameasure of varying equity. It thus illustrates the weaknessesand dangers associated With any&apos; mutual scheme which&apos;-would&apos;involve compulsory payments now&apos;to meet either partly or infull damages which cannot come &quot;within the &quot;category,of necessary restoration until the end Of &quot;the war,&quot; when other relevant circumstances have supervened and the most equitablescheme.can be best established. . In. regard to the employmentof funds lent by the State for the repair and.reconstruction oifixed property including housing, thei justincation-orests entirely on the essential need to enable..the&apos; war to be. carried on.
furthermore, this is not capital compensation, but represents a loan which will be secured by a first charge on the property and on the ultimate compensation payable.8. Continuing our comments on the Government scheme, wecome to a further&apos; inconsistency which we view with realconcern. The Government say that compensation will bemade in accordance with a scale which would at any rate payin full up to a certain limit of loss and thereafter be graded.In other words discrimination will be exercised. The reasonfor this unconditional promise to pay in full up to a certainlimit of loss would appear to be based on meeting the case ofthose who need it most the small owners. There may,however, be many who own small properties within the limit,whose need is less than might appear because they own other forms of property, and there may well be many owners ofproperty above the limit whose need is greater than thosewithin the limit. We regard the Governmenfs decision onthis as inconsistent and discriminating in principle, but possiblyjustifiably excusable on account of its simplicity in dealingwith the case of the small man. We would add that inanalysing the ownership of fixed property, we are struck bythe fact that this form of property does not in reality belong to any privileged class, but that vast numbers of the communityare either directly or indirectly interested in the ownership ofthis property. Bearing this in mind, we can find no justi-fication whatever for the proposal for grading above the limit.9. All these considerations and comments lead us to the sameconclusion as that reached by the Government, that the state should pay compensation (which we assume would be paid in cash or Government Stock) on the highest scale compatible withthe general situation of the country after and not before a conflict, and to this we would add that in our view the objectiveI should be at the end of the war to establish the best method orRlan to pay compensation in full.   In considering this methodI it has to be borne in mind that the liquidation of the cost ofleompensation may well be spread over a much longer period of years than that taken by the physical process of restoration.Further, all our investigations and comments lead us to theTdefinite conclusion that no mutual scheme put before us, andjftio scheme of that type which we are able now to devise in-regard to compensation is practicable or sound, or would give better security or justify greater confidence than the Govern-fment scheme. &apos;   &apos; ; &apos; *&apos; &apos;lo. We do not think that compensation for movable property,plant, equipment and furniture, can be dealt with separatelypom compensation for buildings, and throughout our Report-^erences to. compensation for property fixed or otherwise must06 read as comprising compensation not only for buildings butr?-iso for their contents.
ii. Our comments up to now have dealt only with thequestion of compensation for loss of capital values, but wedo not feel that this covers the whole question. It still leavesopen the possibility for a much less ambitious scheme, that ofproviding by mutual insurance for the payment to owners ofdamaged property an annual amount representing a given rateof interest on the assessed damages, the payment of this tocontinue until the ultimate capital compensation sum has been discharged at the close of the war.It has been represented to us that the postponement of capitalcompensation till after the end of the war would cause hardshipamong various classes of persons interested in property. we need only mention as examples of the embarrassment thatmight arise cases where rent for alternative accommodation hasto be found, or where charitable trusts and others are unable to rely on their income from rents or mortgage interest in orderto fulfil their responsibilities. From this point of view, we have considered the possibility of a limited mutual scheme to safe-guard these payments.In the first place, it has been made clear to us that such ascheme would be of very little assistance to industry and businessgenerally or to institutions engaged in mortgage business on alarge scale. Their chief interest centres naturally on the pay-ment of capital compensation. We have therefore concentratedour attention on the possibility of a limited scheme involving the levying of contributions on and the making of &quot; interest&quot;payments to owners of dwelling-houses only. It appears thatthe practical application of such a scheme would be a matterof great difficulty in war-time conditions. It would entail the registration of all dwelling-houses, the collection of premiumsfrom millions of house-owners and the payment of claims insuch a form as to ensure that no one interested party in any,damaged property gets more than his fair share of the paymentmade in respect of that property. No doubt these are very realobjections to the scheme, but the more fundamental difficultylies in the fact that the problem of &quot; interest &quot; payments re-peats in miniature the problem of capital compensation.Admittedly, the scale of the problem is more limited, but, if thescheme is to be self-supporting -and it appears to us that itwould have to be so the premiums fixed would necessarily be high in relation to the benefits to be derived from the schemeand in many cases might be well beyond the capacity of theowner to pay. There are very many house-owners Who wouldobject strongly to contributing compulsorily the high premiumsrequired in such a scheme and would prefer to take the risk of damage to the property in which they were interested. More-over, it seems to us that the really vital cases of hardship will
be met, so far as is practicable under war-time conditions, bythe arrangements in force for relief of distress in general and forthe repair of damaged houses by Local Authorities and by thereliefs granted under the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act andthe Landlord and Tenant (War Damage) Act. Our recommenda-tion accordingly is that the Government should watch this aspect of the question closely and take whatever steps may seem appro-priate to extend the provisions already made for the relief of immediate hardship, where it can be shown to exist, rather thaninstitute a scheme of great practical complexity and of doubtfulvalue.12. The legislation to which we have already referred doesoffer a very substantial measure of relief to various interests,but there is a further problem to which as yet no solution hasbeen found. The ultimate relationship between mortgagors andmortgagees in respect of damaged property has not yet beenprovided for. It is clear that the liability of the mortgagorunder his personal covenant, while it may be kept in abeyanceduring the war, will nevertheless remain binding upon him afterthe emergency statutory protection has been withdrawn. Itseems to us that the problem is one that must be left until afterthe war, but it does appear desirable that, when that time comes,the Government, in deciding what compensation should be paidto any owner, should give consideration to his obligations tocreditors in respect of the damaged property in such a way asto divide any ultimate loss equitably between the differentinterests concerned in the property. Consideration will also have to be given to the somewhat similar problems that will arise as between lessors and lessees.13. As we have neither found nor devised any practicablemutual scheme it is clear that the question whether such ascheme should be Compulsory or Voluntary in form does notarise at present, but we would say that had any of the mutualschemes appealed to us as satisfactory the element of compulsionwould have been essential. The overruling factor in regard toany of these schemes must be the necessity of spreading theburden over the whole field of property-owners. While it is apoint of minor importance, we would refer to the question ofthe grading of risks according to geographical or other aspectsof vulnerability. Here again the deciding factor must be thatof genuine mutuality or spread, and it seems to us that con-tributions under any scheme would have to be at a uniformrate throughout the different parts of the country.14. We have considered the problem of the considerable,growth in recent months of schemes run by private organisa-tions purporting to give in one form or another protection against war risks to property on land.   The President of theBoard of Trade stated in Parliament on the 27th July, that he
could only advise all who are invited to insure their property in this way to consider whether an undue proportion of con&quot;.tributions may not - be appropriated to management expenses and. also to consider the severe limitation which events mayimpose on the amounts which may be available for compensa-tion in individual cases. He also said that he had no power under the present law to take any action in regard to thismatter, and that he proposed to await the outcome of out enquiry.We are impressed by one factor; common to all such schemes.That is the complete inadequacy of the contributions requestedfor the purpose of forming any really effective fund, thedemands upon which in the way of payments for compensationmay well prove very heavy. It should be noted that these schemes contemplate the payment of contributions to the endof the war only.In some cases the premiums paid are as low as 2s. 6d. percent, for certain areas and we are not aware of any case inwhich the maximum premium rises above 15s. per cent.While we do not suggest that there is any intention to induce the public by misrepresentation to subscribe to these schemes,we are of the opinion that many of the appeals made to thepublic on behalf of the promoters are put in such a form as infact to mislead the public into thinking that a substantial ele-ment of cover against the risk of damage is offered to them.We have received the strongest representations frompractically every representative body coming before us asking that steps should be taken to curtail the activities of the pro-moters of schemes of this kind. Clearly there is in equity noreason to prevent any body of citizens from combiningtogether to form a pool out of which they may derive some measure, however small, of compensation for their losses, butit is a very different matter to allow large scale advertising and widespread circulation of prospectuses to the general public.We recommend therefore that the appropriate GovernmentDepartment should consider;, the most suitable method ofcurtailing the public activities of the sponsors of such schemesby prohibiting circularisation of the general public in the formof prospectuses or advertisement. We do not feel competent to recommend in detail the course of action that should be pursued, but we are convinced that some such action as wehave indicated is necessary in the public interest.15. As regards the administrative machinery to give effectto the Governments plans for compensation, we approve ofthe plans for this which have been prepared by the Government,and during the course of our enquiry we sent to you a recom-mendation that those plans should be put into effect at once.We were glad to learn that this had been done.
i3i16. We would summarise our Report as follows:  (i) We were asked &quot;to-examine the practicability ofevolving any scheme for mutual protection against the risk&apos; &quot;of war damage to fixed property in private ownership &apos;&apos;.We have done so and failed either to find or to deviseany scheme of the mutual protection character whichwould be practicable or justifiable.: (2) At the end of the war.in the light of the general,national situation, the Government and the people willhave to. make their plans to restore as promptly and-effectively as possible the damaged capital assets of thecountry and to-day is not the time to fix with any rigidityprecise means and methods by which this great task shouldbe- discharged.(3) The^ Government, having accepted responsibility for. compensation and having given their promise to meet thisso far as possible by putting the burden on the com-munity, should not be tied to-day by any definite method. of imposing that burden.&apos; (4) The Government should always have before them asthe desirable objective the payment of compensation in full.(5) While agreeing with the Governments proposal to:  pay compensation in full up to a certain limit we see no justification for the proposal to grade above that limit andwe&apos;&quot; recommend   the   Government   to   reconsider   that&quot;proposal (para. 8).&apos; ; (6) Certain matters should be the object of careful attention by the Government:  (a) Special cases of hardship (para. 11).(b) The relationship of mortgagors, mortgagees andother interested parties after the war (para. 12).&apos; (7)&apos; Measures  should  be   taken  to  curtail  privately -organised contributory.schemes (para. 14).17.

- uStatement of Government Policy on the aboveReporti. The Report of the Committee under Lord Weir&apos;s chair-manship must be read in the light of two statements which havealready been made on this subject in the House of Commons,and which are, for convenience, reprinted as Appendices below.They are (i) the statement of general policy made by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer on the 31st January, 1939, and (2)a statement made by the President of the Board of Trade onthe 17th July, 1939, in which it was announced that a confer-ence was to be convened to examine the practicability of evol-ving a scheme under which contributions would be collected from property owners and the proceeds thereof distributed whenlosses occurred. ;2. The Report shows that the Committee has submitted the government&apos;s scheme to a most careful examination and hasmade a close study of the practicability of any mutual scheme.In the result the Committee reports that it has failed eitherto find or devise any scheme of the mutual protection character which would be practicable or justifiable or which would give any better security or justify greater confidence than the Govern-ment scheme. Subject to a point which is referred to later,the Committee has come to the same conclusion as the Govern-ment, that the State should pay compensation on the highestscale compatible with the general situation of the country afterand not before a conflict. ;3. The conclusion of the Committee against the practicability of any mutual scheme applies not only to provision against theloss of capital values but also to any payments in the natureof interest pending the payment of compensation by the Govern-ment at the end of the war. In this connection the Committeerefers to the arrangements which have already been made forthe relief of distress in general and for the repair of essentialproperties, and to Other emergency measures of interest to property-owners. The Government will certainly, as the Com-mittee suggests, keep the working of these measures under Ireview with a special eye to their efficacy in relieving cases of hardship. &apos;.4. The point in the Government scheme to which the Com-mittee directs special attention is the reference in the statementof the 31st January last to the fact that compensation would bepaid in full up to a certain point and thereafter be graded, Inthe first place, the Committee suggests that the Government..should always have before them as the desirable objective the
payment of compensation in full. On this it is not possiblefor the Government to say more at present than that they doregard this as the objective but the possibility of attaining it depends, as has already been made clear, on the total extentof the damage and on our financial circumstances at the endof the war. In the second place, the Committee asks theGovernment to reconsider the decision that, above the limit upto which compensation is payable in full, it should be graded.This matter is closely bound up with the question what total amount of money will be available to pay compensation,whether graded or not, at the end of the war and when thetime comes to decide that question the Government will cer-tainly bear in mind the views of the Committee on the questionof grading.5. Arising out of its enquiry the Committee points out thatthe ultimate relationship between mortgagors, mortgagees andothers interested in property which may be damaged has notyet been provided for. The Committee concludes that thesettlement of this problem must be left until after the war. Thatconclusion accords with the view of the Government. Thematter has, of course implications wider than those at present under consideration but the Government will give it careful con-sideration in connection with the payment of compensation under their scheme.6. Finally, the Committee has, at the invitation of the Gov-ernment, expressed its views on the recent growth in thenumber of schemes promoted by private organisations andpurporting to give in one form or another protection againstwar risks to property on land. The Committee refers to the inadequacy of the contributions under these schemes for thepurpose of forming any really effective fund and while it doesnot suggest that there is any intention to induce the public by misrepresentations to subscribe to these schemes, the Com-mittee is of opinion that many of the appeals made to thepublic on behalf of the promoters are put in such a form asin fact to mislead the public into thinking that a substantialelement of cover against the risk of damage is offered to them.The Committee points out that while there is no reason toprevent any body of citizens from combining together to forma pool out of which they may derive some measure of com-pensation for their losses, it is a different matter to allow scaleadvertising and widespread circulation of prospectuses to thegeneral public. The Committee recommends, therefore, thatthe Government should consider the most suitable method ofcurtailing the public activities of the sponsors of such schemesby prohibiting circularisation of the general public in the formof prospectuses or advertisement. The Government are in full agreement with the views of the Committee in this matter and
have decided that it would be in the national interest to giveeffect to its recommendation. Legislation for this purpose willbe introduced immediately. .7. Read in conjunction with the statement made on the&apos;31stJanuary, 1939, the Report shows that, after the fullest enquiry,the Government plan remains the only one which at one andthe same time meets the reasonable claims of those who mayhave the misfortune to suffer damage to their property andhas regard to the widest interests of the community as a whole.The State is pledged to give them the maximum assistance thatit can afford and that is undoubtedly the highest security theycould have.8. It may be useful to conclude this statement with a refer-ence to the measures which the Government have already takento set up the machinery necessary to carry out the scheme ofcompensation announced in January last. It was then ex-plained that, although compensation could not be made avail-able until the total losses are known at the end of the war, itwould be necessary to assess damage as soon as possible after it occurred in each case. With that object Local Authoritieshave been instructed to furnish early information as to damagedproperties to the Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue De-par tment, which will be responsible for the collection of claims and recording of damage. The staff of the Valuation office will be assisted by a panel of professional men possessing the&quot;necessary technical qualifications whose services will be calledupon as may be necessary in each District and arrangements to that end have reached an advanced stage. Forms on whichclaims to compensation may be made by persons who sufferdamage have been distributed and will be obtainable if theneed arises at the Local Town Hall or office of the LocalAuthority or at the office of the local District Valuer. TheCentral Compensation Board over which one of His Majesty&apos;sJudges will preside&apos; will&apos; be set up in the near future. In themeantime an Advisory Committee has been appointed, underthe chairmanship of Mr. A, Andrewes Uthwatt, to advise as tothe general principles on which damage is to be assessed. ThisCommittee includes the Presidents of. the Royal Institute ofBritish Architects, the Chartered&quot;Surveyors&apos; Institution, andthe Auctioneers and Estate Agents&apos; Institute, a past Chairmanof the British Insurance Association and a Director of the Bankof England. The Report of the Committee will be published indue course.
en f* e*Z (x*appendix i.statement by the chancellor of the exchequer in the house ofcommons.31st January, 1939.Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity with your permission and withthe leave of the House, to state the conclusions reached by the Govern-ment on the subject of compensation from public funds in respect of loss or injury caused to persons or property in this country arising from enemy action, such as bombardment from the air or from the sea, orfrom counter-action taken against any such attacks. The general principle which the Government think should be applied is that such loss or injuryought not to be treated as merely the concern of those who directlysuffer it, but must be regarded as falling upon the community as a whole and consequently as constituting a proper subject for compensation from public funds. In other words, the loss ought not to be left to lie whereit happens to fall, for the risk is one which affects us all, and the par-ticular person or particular property which is struck is the casual victimof a general peril which the State is engaged in doing its utmost to resist and counteract.As regards individuals, the Government have had under considerationarrangements for giving compensation from public funds in respect of death or of injury involving serious disablement caused by air raids orother warlike action. A scheme is being worked out to cover casualties to civilians, its purport being that, in addition to persons enrolled asvolunteers in air raid or other such services who might be injured orkilled while on duty, the scheme would apply to casualties among civilianswholly or mainly dependent for their livelihood upon their employment or occupation. Provision will also have to be made in the scheme forother cases where need arises.The rate of compensation for persons injured or for dependent widowsor children of persons killed, would, broadly speaking, be calculated by reference to the standard rate of compensation and to the conditionsapplicable to the private soldier recruited for service in connection withthe same hostilities.As regards members of the Mercantile Marine, it is proposed that inthe event of their death or injury due to war perils at sea, compensationshall be payable on the basis of rates applicable to personnel recruitedfor service in the Royal Navy during the same hostilities.As regards the various types of private property houses, furniture,factories, stock in trade, etc., the problem presents many grave com-plications. The suggestion has been made that the Government mightinstitute an insurance scheme, collecting premiums from owners and under-taking to pay in full for any subsequent damage whatever may be itsextent. This proposal has been exhaustively examined, and the insuperable difficulty is that no possible basis for an actuarial calculation exists.If the total damage was slight, then no doubt the compulsory exactionw a substantial premium from every owner of private property in thecountry at regular intervals might over a period build up a sufficientfund, though the management of such a fund would present difficulties ofits own. But, equally, if the damage was heavy and prolonged, the fundso built up might be wholly inadequate, and to avoid this risk as far aspossible premiums might have to be raised to a figure not generally acceptable and not suitable for compulsory and universal collection. Itis these considerations, no doubt, which have led those carrying on the
business of insurance to decline this class of insurance, for the risk is notin fact an insurable proposition. The Government, therefore, cannotcontemplate a scheme which would commit the community to so vagueand indeterminate a liability. That does not mean in the least that individual properties which suffer ought to be left to bear the lossunaided; but that the compensation should be on the highest scale com-patible with the circumstances of the country after and not before a conflict. When the extent of the damage to property in private ownershipis known, such contribution will be made from public funds as the cir-cumstances make possible, in accordance with a scale which would at anvrate pay in full up to a certain limit of loss and thereafter would liegraded. Although compensation cannot be made available until the total losses are known at the end of such a conflict, it would be necessary to assess damage as soon as possible after it occurred in each case, and ascheme has been drawn up for this purpose which can be put intooperation immediately it is required.There will be a compensation board presided over by one of HisMajesty&apos;s Judges and the collection of claims and recording ol damagewill be in the hands of the Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue as a nucleus, with additional professional assistance. Various questions affect-ing the contractual relations between freeholders, leaseholders and other persons interested in property must be specially dealt with. These problemshave been examined by a Committee appointed by the Lord Chancellor,the report of which will be published immediately.I have dealt so far with private property in general but I must nowmention certain particular- categories of property. The necessary defer-ment of compensation until the end of the emergency would in the absenceof special steps result in the holding up of necessary repairs to essentialproperty which has been damaged. Accordingly a plan has been worked out for the emergency reconstruction of essential property including where necessary housing accommodation.No less urgent is the question of stocks of commodities. Stock in tradeis quantitatively a. very much smaller problem than that of property ingeneral and from the point -of view of the community as a whole it is vital to secure the continued flow of necessary supplies to this countryupon which our existence during the emergency would largely depend.Such imports are financed on the basis that they will be disposed of indue course after being brought here. If they are destroyed by enemy action the private finance to import other goods in their place may not be available.Our plans in this connection are two-fold. In the first place we shallshortly announce a comprehensive scheme for marine war risks. So faras hulls are concerned, the Government have made an arrangement withthe several Mutual War Risks Associations in this country under whichthey will re-insure the Associations, up to 80 per cent, of the value ofthe ships as fixed under the agreement, in respect of claims arising outof loss or damage due to action by or against the King&apos;s Enemies. There-insurance will be without premium for voyages which are current when an emergency arises, and thereafter will be on a premium basis. Theprinciple of the scheme for cargo insurance is that, those customarilyoffering insurance of such risks will form a pool and the pool will beable to reinsure King&apos;s Enemy risks with the Government. This schemeis designed to operate in time of peace with the special object that by giving complete cover to all engaged in trade there should be- no checkto the flow of goods into and out of the country during any period 01anxiety or emergency. Comparable facilities will also be made availablein time of war. -There will also be a scheme to cover goods between ship and warehouse.
APPENDIX II.statement by the president of the board of trade in the house ofcommons.17th July, 1939........   My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to convene, on behalf of the Govern-ment, a conference of four or five gentlemen of recognised ability and toask them to examine the practicability of evolving any scheme for mutualprotection against risk of mr damage to fixed property in private owner-ship, excluding ships, cargoes and commodities which are already coveredby the scheme of the Bill. The Government must maintain the viewthat no scheme could be acceptable which would promise to provide anunlimited amount out of public funds for compensation, and the objectof the further inquiry is to examine any suggestions that may be madeconsistently with this essential condition. But if a practical scheme couldbe evolved, it would not necessarily be rejected by the Government merely because it involved some Government contribution of a reasonable andascertainable amount. Steps are being taken to constitute and convenethe conference at once, and the conference will be asked to advise whetherparticipation in any scheme which they think it practicable to recommend should be compulsory on all property owners, or whether it should bevoluntary. The conference will have power to call into consultation such persons as they may think are able to assist them in their deliberations.The day-by-day proceedings of the conference will have to be confidential,and, indeed, some of the matters with which the members of the conference will have to deal are necessarily secret; but, when the time comes, theGovernment will be glad to consider how far their conclusions can bepublished.......(20499 1)   Vvt. 943A  50   10/39   P- St.   G. 390As regards essential stocks on land, we have found it practicable to devise an insurance plan. This will cover all goods which in the opinionof the Board of Trade are essential to the life of the community duringwar including the maintenance of the export trade. The scheme will be worked through the fire insurance companies and Lloyds. As the owners of such goods will receive compensation in full immediately, a premiumwill be charged in war. There will be no premium in peace, but it willbe necessary for the persons concerned to register at a nominal fee sufficientto cover expenses with their insurer and they will be allowed to -ask forendorsements of their policies as required from time to time. In warthe scheme would be compulsory and the fee for delayed registrationwould be increased. This scheme will cover all goods of the class I have mentioned whether they are raw materials, commodities or in course- ofmanufacture, and the scheme applies to importers, manufacturers and merchants. Retail trade, owing to its diversity and to the great numbersof traders involved, represents an especially difficult problem, details ofwhich are still under examination. But it is our intention in one formor another to cover retailers who stock essential commodities againstdamage to those stocks.In framing the plans, of which I have now given the outline to theHouse, we have had the advantage of consultation with the insuranceinterests and, as I have already said to the House, the scheme for insur-ing essential stocks will be worked on behalf of the Government throughthe fire insurance companies and Lloyds. But it is right to emphasise that the scheme is a Government scheme and no responsibility for itattaches to the insurance interests.
