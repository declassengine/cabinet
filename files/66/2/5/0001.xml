(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)MOST SECRET COPY NO.- TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEYW.P.(39)55,        my---------------------It is requested U.., -: . f-Ta; be taken to question of Russian threat to india memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India.9 JAs the Cabinet will be aware, the AfghanGovernment are becoming increasingly apprehensive ofRussian aggression.    Should it become apparent that itwas the intention of the Soviet Government to create a diversion in this direction, consideration of the position on the North-West Frontier of India would become urgent.The present Indian War plan provides only for a strictlydefensive policy on the frontier even against the minormenace, i.e. an incursion by Afghan forces similar to.that of 1919, known as the Third Afghan War, anda fortiori against aggression by a First Class Power..    I attach a table showing the approximate allocation of theforces, other than external defence troops, at present available in India. .Russian communications in the direction of afghanistan are poor and it would be desirable on anysign of the movement of Russian troops to endeavour toincrease their Inefficiency by organising sabotage on a comprehensive scale.   We have not much information aboutthe present attitude of the native population in RussianTurkistan., but, subject to any information that can beobtained on this point, it seems not unlikely that some ofthem, or refugees from that country in Afghanistan,might, with the offer of reasonable inducements, takereadily enough to this form of warfare,

I should imagine however that it is much more likely that a Russian diversion in this direction wouldtake the form of air raids and I am mainly concerned topoint out that there are in India no forces capable ofdealing with air raids by a First Class Power.   There is-   in the whole of the country no more than one solitaryanti-aircraft battery consisting; of eight 3&quot; guns; thereare no fighter aeroplanes at all.   Quite apart from any material damage which raiding aircraft might do, theknowledge that they were practically immune from attack would have a demoralising effect on the people and wouldhave a most damaging effect on our prestige not only inIndia but throughout the Near and Middle East.   Mypersonal knowledge of Russian Central Asia is not sufficiently recent to enable me to form any opinion ofthe possibility of serious Russian air attack from that quarter; but I do suggest that it is a matter which calls for examination.&apos; In present circumstances it is desirable that weshould do everything possible to strengthen our intelligence organisation in the countries bordering on Russian Turkistan with a view to getting furtherinformation about conditions in that country and anylight that can be obtained on the intention of the soviet authorities.    I am taking this matter up with theCovernment of India.Z.INDIA OFFICE,21st September 1939.
