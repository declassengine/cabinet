THERE seems to be some misunderstanding about the proposal under examination. Everyone can see how necessary it is to have Italy friendly and how desirable to have her an Ally. The best way to work up good relations witha country or with a person is to develop common interests and, as far as possible,partnership in a common policy. Once engaged on this path, one thing leads toanother, and confidence ripens into comradeship.2. The Foreign Secretary has pointed out that a wide common field may -be open to Great Britain and Italy in Balkan politics. A question arose thenwhether a military and naval Detente could not be established. The militaryDetente would take place between Italy and France. In the naval sphere itwould be between Great Britain and Italy, with France coming along. I havenever contemplated a bargain about reducing the garrison of Egypt. This,indeed, might follow from the establishment of security in the Mediterraneanthrough the close co-operation of Great Britain and Italy. No one would wishto keep a large army in Egypt simply to build up what is called a reserve inthe Middle East, irrespective of the general military situation. Obviously thestrength of our Army in Egypt will be reviewed from time to time. But if theFrench and the Italians reached a degree of friendly relationship, which enabledthem both to bring home an equal number of divisions, it would be all tothe good.3.   There   remains   the   question   of   a   naval   arrangement   in   theMediterranean.   The essence of such a plan is that no submarine craft except those belonging to the Mediterranean Powers should be allowed in these waters.This would free the inland sea from the disturbance of U-boat warfare.If Italy, France and Great Britain could agree upon this, and would take joint action against non-Mediterranean-owned submarines, it would be greatly to our advantage.   We can certainly stop all German surface craft from entering.I Therefore there would be no hostile warships in the Mediterranean, exceptI perhaps U-boats which Italy, France and ourselves would combine to forbid, and\ even to put down.  The mere process of Italian ships acting with ours would beof extreme value.4. W.P. (39) 85 by the Chiefs of the Staff observes paragraph 10 that&quot; Germany has a right to send submarines into the Mediterranean, and that italy, as a neutral, has no right to stop her,&quot; but the whole point is that if ItalyMe-morar.idum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.[20158]
were induced to take part in the arrangements proposed above, she would nolonger be a neutral in the ordinary sense. President Roosevelt is trying to putdown U-boat warfare in the domestic waters of the United States, and we arein full accord with him; yet no one has impugned American neutrality. It maywell be that a united declaration against non-Mediterranean submarine craftoperating in the Mediterranean could be made without leading to a declarationof war by Germany on Italy. Of course, if Italy did not wish, or did not dare,to take a part in such an arrangement, the Whole question falls to the ground.But even so, conversations upon these lines might give something to talk about,and could do no harm. They would show our desire to draw Italy into our system.5. No question of the general rights of belligerency at sea arises. these rights are valued because they are often a help to us, and we are fully entitled to waive them for good reasons in any particular case. This would be a special arrangement for a special occasion, and we should, of course, safeguard by a clause in the Agreement all existing principles of international law.6. When I read in Clause 10, Sub-Section 4, of W.P. (39) 85 that &quot;theAllies could not in any case relax their anti-submarine precautions,&quot; I mustobserve that it was only yesterday that the withdrawal of another flotilla fromthe Mediterranean rendered it impossible for us to take any anti-U-boatprecautions so far as commerce is concerned, and to keep our remaining flotillafor the protection only of our Fleet.   We have, in fact, &quot; relaxed &quot; already.7. Lastly, there is the whole question of contraband and squeezing Germany.This has got to be arranged for with Italy anyhow, quite independently of anynaval arrangement between Britain, France and Italy. Nothing, in any such agreement as has been mooted, would relieve us from pressing Italy hard uponrationing or self-rationing. But a friendly basis reached in the diplomatic,military and naval spheres might be a help and not a hindrance in this. nothing in the conversations suggested with Italy would prevent the strictest measuresof contraband control being applied to other Powers in the Mediterranean. Onthe contrary, one would hope that with the aid of Italy, or without any fear ofItaly, they might be carried to a sharper stringency than at present.8. To sum up, it would be a great advantage to us if Britain, France andItaly could jointly say : &quot; Keep the U-boat warfare out of the Mediterranean &quot;;and, secondly, the mere process of trying to say this might bring about Anglo-Franco-Italian co-operation.W. s. c.A dmiralty, October IS, 1939.
