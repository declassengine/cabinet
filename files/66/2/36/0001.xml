iCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAiESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 9 QIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.AIR   POLICY.Draft Memorandum for communication to the French.The British Chiefs of Staff have recentlyexamined the principles which,, in the face of thesituation which now confronts the Allies,  should govern the employment of the British- bomber.f orce,and the manner, in whi.ch....the&amp;e--principles should beput into effect in various alternative situations.2. On the question of principle, the conclusions which they have reached and which have been generally approved by the War Cabinet, are as follows:-..(a)....The Allied inferiority vis-a-vis Germany in existing air-^-trengtiis.     From &quot;this . it follows that for the present the Initiative is withGermany;    our-action, roust--be conditioned by her action.It also follows that,  so far as enemy actionpermits, we should conserve and develop our resources until the gap in numerical strength is narrowed.      In particular, we should notfritter away our striking force on unprofitableobjectives in deference, to public clamour forretaliation or public criticism at Inaction.(b) On the other hand, we must not shrink from usingall that we have got if enemy action againsteither France or ourselves looks like beingdecisive.      In that event, our striking force must be employed at all costs in the manner that holds out the best hope of obtainingdecisive re sail ts against Germany.

(c) Germany7s weakest spot is the Ruhr, the heart of which is about the size of Greater London, andin which is concentrated approximately 60% ofGermany7 s. vital industry.    It contains, moreover,a population which might &quot;be expected to crackunder intensive air attack.    Such attacks wouldinvolve a heavy cansalty roll among civilians,including women and children.(d) We should not be the first to utake the glovesoff&quot;.    From this it follows that until and unless Germany, by killing large numbers of civilians, either by indiscriminate air attackon Prance or Great Britain,  or in the course ofa violation of Belgium, gives the necessaryJustification, there could be no question of attacking the Ruhr,  or anything other thanstrictly military objectives.3. The application of the above principles to various alternative hypotheses may be illustrated asfollows;-(i) If the enemy confines his attack,  either onthe French or ourselves, to strictly military objectives, we should reply by strictly limitedattacks on corresponding German objectives,i.e. we should continue our present bombardmentpolicyc(ii) If the enemy attacks convoys or even our east coast ports indecisively, i.e.  if they are not doing vital damage - we&apos;should still not do anything to invite retaliation which might dous vital damageo(iii) If the Germans should either undertake intensiveand indiscriminate air action against france or ourselves, or alternatively, if they wereto attack France through Belgium and causes considerable civilian casualties in the processof violating the latter, we should attack the Ruhras our first and chief objective.    In the latteralternative this attack would be combined with &apos;action against any favourable military targetspresented by the advance of the German   forces.The delivery of an attack on the Ruhr would,of course, be a matter for decision by theBritish War Cabinet at the time.4. The British Chiefs of Staff would be glad to be informed whether the French High Command are inagreement with the views oxpr onaod in paragraphs 2 and 3aboveTerrace, S.W.I.October,  1939.
