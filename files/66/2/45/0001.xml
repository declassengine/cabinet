OW.P.(59)  95,WAR CABINETcBELGIUM AND HOLLAND;    MEASURES TO BE TAKENIN THE EVENT OF AN INVASION BY germany.Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio,covering Progress Report.On Saturday,   7th Octobers (War Cabinet 40(39)Conclusion 6), I was asked by the War Cabinet to co-coordinate the preparations and action of Government Departments in giving effect to the recommendations of the Chiefs of staff committee for the eventuality of a German invasion ofBelgium and/or Holland (.W.P. ( 39)90) .20 A progress Report is attached herewith which  shows the action already taken with a view to reducing some ofthe useful assets which Germany would be likely i(to acquireby an occupation of either of these countries, as well asthe further action which would be taken so far as circumstances permit if the emergency should arise.So After taking stock of the situation in a preliminaryway I arranged with the Foreign Office to communicate withHis Majesty1s Ambassador at Brussels and His Majesty&apos;minister at The Hague explaining the position in this matter,giving them certain instructions and asking their adviceas to whether any approach could be made to the respective governments, and if so, in what form and on what subjects.These letters were sent on 12th October,    In neithercountry did our representative think it advisable to take

up the question on a diplomatic footing at the present stage.      Both the Belgian and Dutch Governments, asthe War Cabinet are aware, refuse officially to admit thatthey are in any immediate danger of attack, notwi thstandingthat they have large forces on a war footing for that very contingencya     The real truth seems to be that theyare terrified of taking any action which might be used byGermany as a pretext for a breach of their undertaking toleave these countries alone,,      Nevertheless, our diplomatic representatives may be able to effect a certain amountthrough their Service and Commercial Attacheso4o It will be seen from the attached Report, and fromthe summary of it in the following paragraphs, that it hasbeen possible one way or another to prepare a fairly com-prehensive scheme.     Moreover, there is a good deal ofevidence that the Belgian Government and people are determined to prevent their assets falling into German hands in the eventof invasion,,5. In this present phase, apart from making plans for theemergency under consideration, the main object of our arrange-ments is to reduce stocks in Belgium and Holland of such thingsas gold, oil fuel and other raw materials and the number ofships in port.     .In the absence of co-operation by the belgian and Dutch Governments we can only work through private channels,but even so, something has been accomplished.GOLD AMD SECURITIES.6. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Brussels has ascertainedthrough private channels that the greater part of the Belgiangold reserve is in Englandc    Another part is in New York, and onlya small proportion - probably about one sixth - is left in Belgium.This part is not in Brussels nor in Antwerp, but it is understood to be at some place not far from the Coast,    No special precau-tions have been taken for safeguarding securities in the possess-ion of the Rational Bank, though the Governor is alive to thenecessity of preventing them from falling into German hands.    It. ^    &apos; 111 wMMU

looks,, therefore, as though the Belgians could be relied onin an emergency to deal with gold as they did in 1914.The Ambassador has-been instructed, however,that if, in the last resort, the Belgian Government should,be caught without a plan, he is to.use his utmostendeavour to induce them to send out of the country as muchas possible of the gold and securities that still remainthere .7. Similar instructions were sent to the british minister in Holland, and in this country also progress has beenmade so far as gold and foreign securities are concernedthrough a private channel-So The Chancellor of the Exchequer was good enough tosee the Governor of the Bank of England in my presence andarranged with him that he should send, an emissary to sound the Governor of the Nederlandsche Bank as to what they were doing.    This emissary has now returned and reports that since February, 1939, the Nederlandsche Bank has heldoutside Holland 60% of its total gold stock, or approximately 110 millions out of a total of  185 millions.    The amountremaining in Holland., therefore, is only  75 millions ascompared with a figure of  110 millions as stated in the annex to the Chiefs of Staff Report,    The Governor of theNederlandsche Bank is anxious to export a further  hOmillions, which would leave only 20% of the gold stock athome. . Shipment would be first to London and afterwards tothe United States of America.    The Governor was impressedhimself by the urgency of the question but did not expecta decision by the Dutch Government for a week or two.    Hewas anxious, by the way,, that the fact of a special visit to him should not be made known through diplomatic channels.

Referring to foreign securities he added that the bigDutch companies appeared to have taken adequate steps ontheir own initiative to safeguard their holdings.   Asto other holdings of foreign securities, he said that theGovernment have for the time being abstained from takingemergency measures which they feel might adversely affectpublic confidence,9o That, in summary, is how the question of gold standsat the present moment .    It is a good deal less unsatisfactorythan when we began to move.    Now that the authorities concerned have been put on their guard we may hope that stocks may be still further reduced and that prompt action may be taken in an emergency*NON-FERROUS METALS.10o The Minister of Economic Warfare has ascertained that stocks in Holland and Belgium are not large.    Theonly problem in this field is copper, of which a considerableamount passes into Belgium, some for re-export to Germany.The Ministry of Economic Warfare are taking action toreduce both stocks a.nd imports.    Belgian and Dutchrefineries and smelters will probably be closed down and oreswill be treated abxaoadnOIL,11c The Ministry of Economic Warfare reports that thereare 600,000 tons in Holland., but consultations with the shell Company indicate little chance of getting any of thisremoved in time of peace.    The Dutch experts consider thatall stocks could be destroyed at short notice.   A managing director of the Royal Dutch has left for Holland and willtry to find out whether the Dxitch Government have made anyplans to destroy the oil in an emergency.    Prom the listannexed to this report it will be seen that if the emergencyarises His MajestyTs Representatives in Belgium and Hollandare to impress on the Governments the urgent need of action

O d Jto.destroy thei oil stocks, or failing such action, toco-operate in demolition plans which are being worked out in detail between the War Office and Admiralty,Plans are also being worked out by the Air ministry for the destruction by air of the main oil stocks in belgium and Holland by aerial bombardment for possibleexecution if all other means fail,12, Prom the above it will be seen^ thereforej, thatthe plans for the destruction of the oil are threefold.First by the Belgian and Dutch authorities with or without British co-operation; second by the War Office,whose personnel would be taken over by the Admiralty indestroyers (see below)j and third, in the last resort,by the Royal Air Force.    Stocks of oil at Zeebruggewould be dealt with by Naval blocking parties (see below),and at Ghent and Bruges by the French.13o The necessary information on these matters is in the possession of the Military Attaches at Brussels and atthe Hague so that, under the authority of the Ambassadoror Minister respectively, they can try and. arrangeco-operation with the Dutch and Belgians.WHALE OIL.Hj.0 There are 29,000 tons of whale oil which belongs tous in Holland.    Efforts are being made through His Majesty&apos;s

Minister to secure the release of this oil in return for delivery, in instalments, of an equivalent amount to holland by us.DOCK AND HARBOUR FACILITIES.15o       The arrangements made include plans for preventingdock and harbour facilities so far as practicable from falling into German hands.     These vary very considerablyat the different ports, but pending further information which we are obtaining, I am unable to say whether theywill be worth putting in execution except at Zeebrugge andOstendn16o       In the case of the Dutch ports and Antwerp, forexample, His Majesty^s Representatives will do what theycan to try and induce the Government concerned to make planswith this object,17c       In case the Governments do not take any action,however, British plans are being prepared and in some cases are well advanced0180       For example, plans have been worked out and preparations completed for sending British destroyers toYmuiden (for Amsterdam), Flushing, Hook of Holland andAntwerp to carry out local demolitions of harbour and dockfacilities and coast defences,,     Arrangements have been made between the Admiralty and the Foreign Office for the officers concerned to visit these ports.     Certain reconnaissanceshave also been completed under War Office authority,19.       In the case of Ostend and Zeebrugge, the admiralty have made more definite plans and preparations.     Blockships have been prepared;    personnel has been selected, andtraining is proceedings     Discussions with a view to Frencheo-operation are in progress.      The signal arrangements are complete.     Air protection has been arranged with the Air

Ministry.     Everything is ready, therefore, for the blocking of these harbours in case of necessity,      Theresponsibility for deciding the moment when the blockshipsare to be despatched rests with the Admiralty, and theFirst Lord will obtain a decision e.g. from the PrimeMinister or War Cabinet according to circumstances.     Theresponsibility for ordering the ports to be blocked will&apos;rest with the Commander-in-Chief of the French armies of theNorth-East (General Georges), who, it is assumed will have thefullest knowledge of the military situation in Belgium.Four alternative lines of communication from General Georges&apos;Headquarters to the Admiral in command of the Blockshipsare available.     In the last resort, however, the naval officers on the spot might have to act on their responsibility :and should be instructed accordingly.ROLLING STOCK.20.     With a view to the removal or destruction of Belgianrolling stock, and particularly heavy locomotives which are ofgreat importance, the French have been approached through thepermanent Military Representatives.     The French representatives have accepted the responsibility and passed the matter on to paris.21.      In addition, His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in belgium and Holland have been asked, in an emergency, to impress onthese Governments the importance of removing or destroyingrolling stock and particularly locomotives.      This latterprovision applies also in respect of mechanical transport.His majesty&apos;s Representatives in Holland have also been askedto impress on the Government the importance of preventingXffiTal and shipbuilding facilities, and particularly submarinesunder construction., from falling into the hands of theGermans.     The Naval Attache is in possession of details.

GABLES.22.     The Admiralty have prepared a plan for disconnecting allcables from Holland and Belgium at the appropriate moment,SHIPPING,  INCLUDING TANKERS.S3,;     The Board   of Trade have taken action in respect ofshipping.     They report that the Dutch are fully alive to thedesirability of getting tankers into safety.     Action has beentaken through Sir Andrew Agnew, who will do all he can to furtherour objects.24.      Some weeks ago a Dutch shipowner made enquiries from theBoard of Trade as to whether accommodation could be found forhis ships- in this country in the event of a war emergency.Conversations are proceeding between the Board of Trade and arepresentative of Dutch cargo shipowners to make arrangements for ships to take refuge in British ports in an emergency.25.      In Belgium the Consul-General at Antwerp has been told tomake discreet enquiries of companies concerned as to whatprovision is being made for removal of shipping in case of anemergency.26.     The Admiralty are including in their plans arrangementsfor the destruction of dredgers, tugs? etc., in an emergency.27.     The War Office consider it important to secure the removalof barges from Belgian rivers and canals and particularly out ofthe river Scheldt, upon which the army relies as an obstacle to aGerman advance.      They have approached the Board of Trade with aview to the purchase of Belgian barges on a large scale so as tomove them over to the United Kingdom before the emergency arises.The Military Attache In Brussels has been asked by the War Officeto try and induce the Belgian Military Authorities to arrangefor the Scheldt to be kept clear of barges.

AIRCRAFT AND AERODROMES.28o An Air Mission will be sent to Belgium in anemergency which., together with the Air Attaches in belgium and Holland, will take all possible steps toensure that the Dutch and Belgian authorities remove all aircraft,, civil and military, and trained personnel before it is too late,  and destroy all aerodrome facilities.,The Air Attaches have been instructed on this subject and as to the evacuation of aircraft of civil operatingcompanies and technical personnelo     The question of thedisposal of military aircraft is under discussion withthe FrenchoMACHINE TOOLSo29o Lists of the types of equipment which it would-be most desirable to remove or destroy have been obtainedfrom the Ministry of Supply and forwarded to the Foreign.Office for communication to His Majesty&apos;s representatives in Belgium and Holland, who are being instructed, to impress on the Governments the importance of preventingthese tools from falling Into enemy hands intacto     Theywill take this matter up the moment an emergency arises,if not beforeoPOWER STATIONS,i    i    ii i.............30o If His Majesty&apos;s Representatives think such acourse desirable, the Military Attaches in Belgium and holland are to draw the attention of the staffs to theimportance of including Power Stations in the generaldemolition plans.ACTION IN AN EMERGENCY.3l0 Should an invasion by Germany of Belgium orHolland, or both, take place the f following action willbe required to set the scheme in motion:-

(l)   A decision by the War Cabinet to put the wholoscheme in operation,(S) A decision by the War Cabinet to authorise theAdmiralty, if Belgium is invaded, to despatchblock ships to Ostend and Zeebrugge;(3)    In the case of an invasion of Holland, adecision by the War Cabinet as to whetherthe destroyers are to be despatched^,(4)    If the War Office are prepared to implement their plan fcr the destruction of the main oil stocks in Holland and Belgium, a decision^bythe War Cabinet as to whether the Armydetachments are to bo sent in the destroyers,(5)   His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Brussels and/or theBritish Minister at The Hague to be informed by the    Secretary of State for foreign affairs of the decision of the War cabinet and instructed to take the pre-arranged action,(6)   A decision at the appropriate moment empowering the Admiralty to disconnect cables between this country and Belgium and./or Hollandre spe c tIvely,32. I should be glad of authority to arrange forthe communication of these arrangements to the french authorities,    I think that the safest channel would be through the Naval, Military and Air liaison systems,but perhaps the Chiefs of Staff Committee could beauthorised to concert the necessary arrangements.    Inany event I would propose in any such communication to refer only very briefly to the fact thatarrangements are being made through the proper channelsfor the reduction and removal of gold supplies.33. A specimen copy of the fourth edition of the periodical Progress Report showing the state of progress on 23rd October, 1939 is attached herewith,      I propose Ukeep in close touch with this question and to submitfurther periodical reports as occasion may require.(Signed)    HANKEY.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.83rd October, 1939.
