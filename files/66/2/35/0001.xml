NO-.WAR CABINET.PpSSIBLE,DETENTE WITH ITALY:&apos; IN&quot; THE &quot;MEDIWrRANLSAn&quot;.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.At the 46th Meeting of the War Cabinet on 13thOctober;, 1939s  the Chiefs of Staff were invited, to submit a report on the suggestion for a Mediterranean detente,and. for the mutual withdrawal of land and air forces..fr-omNorth Africa.Mediterranean Detente.2. The proposal made to the War Cabinet was that itwould be in the common interest of Great Britain, france and  Italy to keep the war from spreading in theMediterranean,  and. that some agreement with Italy might therefore be possible which would forbid belligerent actsin that area.General Aspects3. Proposals to neutralise a particular area of thehigh seas in which belligerent acts would be forbidden areanalogous to the restrictions in the rights of Sea Powerscovered by the general term &quot;The Freedom of the Seas&quot;.

The Declaration of Paris and. the Declaration of London areexamples.    The supporters of these measures argue that itis to our interest,  as the Power most dependent on seabornetrade,  to have that trade protected from enemy attack by international agreement,, and that, for that alleged security,,we should abandon all or part of our power to interfere withthe seaborne supplies of our enemies.    This argument isbased on the fallacy that any such agreement will be respected by our enemies in time of stress., whereas the only suresecurity is to have the strength and power to defendour sea communications by our own forces.4. Again,  if we abandon the right to restrict theseaborne trade of our enemies, we abandon what is ultimately.the greatest power we possess and the only sure guarantee that we can ultimately win the war.    Generally speaking,therefore, any proposal to restrict belligerent rights at sea is to our disadvantage and should be resisted,,5. The resolution by the Panama Conference to form anon-belligerent zone round the American Continent is,  ofcourse, a case in point.    Only the need for securing U. S. A.friendship, and the possibility that the operation of therestrictions in practice would bring the U.S.A.  into the war on our side, could justify our acceptance of this zone, andeven if we accept it from the U,ScA0, we should certainly not accept it from any other Power.6.- While on general grounds,  therefore, we should oppose the creation of special regimes at sea, proposals made in time of war to depart from our historic attitudemust be given most careful consideration, from the point ofview of any irnmediate advantage that they may bring to us.

Naval. Aspee u . t,70 The discussions in the Wan Cabinet made it clear thatthe elimination of German submarines from the Mediterraneanby an agreed policy among the Mediterranean powers was themain idea underlying the proposal in paragraph 2,, and it isdesirable therefore,,  to examine this aspect first,particularly as we have, at present, nothing to worry aboutfrom German surface and air attack in that area080 The proposal would be intended&apos; to bar german submarines from the Mediterranean while admitting Britishand French submarines0    Under International Law belligerentshave certain rights,,  and Germany as a belligerent is clearlyentitled to send submarines into the Mediterranean;and it would be a hostile act for Italy,  as a neutral,  to attempt to prevent her from doing so    Therewould be no just ification In law for treating german submarines as pirates and we should be wrong in maintainingsuch a claim.    Only If submarine warfare is exceeding thelimits imposed in the Submarine Protocol does it becomeillegal,,9 c. There would seem to be small reason to hope that italy would enter into such, an agreement with the risk ofincurring immediate German hostility,,    Even if she did, wecould not depend on her active assistance at sea,  unless sheactually entered the war on our side0    The Allies would not,therefore, be able to relax any of their precautions against German submarines,  such as the provision of patrols and escorts0

10. From the above we conclude that:-(i) Any proposal to restrict belligerent&apos;rights at sea would be to our general disadvantage,,(ii) Germany as a belligerent has the right to sendsubmarines into the Mediterranean,,(iii) Italy as a neutral has no right to attempt to stop herc(iv) The Allies could not,  in any case, relax theirant i- submarine ine pr ec aut ions.-,Contraband Control in the,Mediterraneanllo An important consideration is how the &quot;neutralization&quot;proposal would affect the exercise of contraband control by theAllies in the Mediterranean area,120 It is assumed that in no circumstances should weabandon control of contraband in the Straits of Gibraltar,and at Suez before it enters Egyptian waters.    But inexercising contraband control we commit belligerent acts;and if the Mediterranean were neutralized, we should be debarred from such exercise inside the Mediterranean itself.13. .       The relaxation of Allied control inside theMediterranean would open up to Germany supplies of Melillairon ore, Roumanian oil and the surplus resources of Russia.It would remove the last defence of contiguous neutrals inthe Mediterranean against German demands both for their ownproduce and for the use of their transport facilities,-Moreover,  it would greatly reduce our own ability to bring pressure upon these neutrals should we later desire it,14. It would be very doubtful whether any self-rationingagreement with Italy could be made so effective as to compensate us for the d.irect control which we should lose.In order to save time preliminary views of theMinistry of Economic Warfare on this aspect ofthe problem have been ascertained,,

9Q94* O eiIndeed we are informed that considerable importation is already.,taking place (by means of false bills of lading etc,),  ofwhich the Italian Government themselves are not aware,159 There is evidence that the German exports drive,which started in the second week of September,  is alreadywaning because German agents cannot redeem their promises tosupply0    Any weakening of the control of imports of rawmaterials at the moment might enable a part of these promisesto be redeemed and would further handicap Allied exporters,,Moreover,  should it be found possible at a later stage in thewar directly to attack German export trade as a retaliatorymeasure,  the difficulties in putting this into effect wouldbe immensely increased,,16. German command of Roumanian and Russian resources,and her economic domination of South Eastern Europe, must therefore be most unfavourable to the Allied cause    So faras can be seen Germany might well cover all her minimumdeficiency requirements by imports from the Mediterranean and black Sea Countries,  supplemented by such supplies from out-side the Mediterranean as would inevitably reach her throughneutrals despite control at the entrances.17. With the breakdown of our economic pressure in theMediterranean,  our contraband control in the North Sea wouldbecome almost valueless0    In any event its maintenance wouldresult in discrimination against Diitch, Belgian andScandinavian trade in favour of that of the Mediterranean and.Black Sea Countries,    Such discrimination would also extend to oversea suppliers,  and American oil interests would corn-plain of the advantages given to Russian and Roumanianproducers.    This state of affairs would be untenable for political reasons

18.Even if we assume that we should in no circumstances abandon control of contraband at gibraltar and Suez, we conclude from the above that;-&quot;(i) .jfcfeutj?.alijsing the Mediterranean involvesremoving Allied Contraband Control frominside that sea.(ii) Germany would be able to draw freelyon Black Sea Countries for suppliesshipped to Mediterranean ports*(iii) Germany could obtain valuableadditional supplies of deficiencymaterials from Spain, Spanish Morocco,Greece, Turkey and perhaps Egypt.(iv) The loss of our control would not be compensated by any self-rationingagreement we could make with Italy.(v) Germany&apos;s present export drive wouldbe facilitated, her difficulties inobtaining foreign exchange would bedecreased, and Allied reprisals against their export trade would be rendered moredifficultoJ^viJ-JStorthern Contraband Control would&quot;b-e-c-ome practically ineffective even ifpolitJx;any.....pra^ticahle.    The whale. .structure of our economic pressure would be. in danger of collapse.

20o We turn, therefore, to examine the military implications of a mutual withdrawal of land and air forces as a possible means of bringing about the desired detentewith Italy.21o An agreement which Involved the withdrawal of anyof our land and air forces from the Middle Ease area as a&quot;Whole. would have the following military &quot;implications:-(a) The Italians could move forces back to Libyafar more quickly than we could to the Middle.-. Easto   Apart from this question of relativetimings a sudden reinforcement of the middle east might involve serious problems of shipping and escort at a difficult moment,,(b) The reduction of our forces in the Middle east would be in direct contradiction to our presentprojected policy of building up a reserve inthe Middle East,    This reserve is now all themore necessary in view of the possible consequences of Russian pressure on Turkey, andof the possibility of Russian activity in the balkans,,  Iraq and Iran.(c) A show of force is the only argument that countswith oriental nations,,    A-weakening of our forces at the present moment would give anopportunity to subversive elements to createtrouble in Egypt, Palestine,  Iraq and the ArabworId generallyft(d) Any reduction of onr forces in the Middle east would greatly weaken our influence in Turkey,Greece,  and the other Balkan Countries.- (e) It is most undesirable that any agreement shouldbe reached which might prevent Dominion forcesconcentrating in the Middle East.,  either aspart of the Middle East reserve or en route for service elsewhere,,Mutual Withdrawal of La&apos;id jijid Ai? Forces,19. Our consideration of the general and naval aspectsof the proposal to keep war from spreading to theMediterranean makes it clear that it would he against our interests to attempt to bring about a detente by means ofneutralizing that area,-

/will be seen from the foregoing that anywithdrawal of forces from the Middle Bast area as a whole would be strategically unsound.Redistribution of land and air forces in the Middle East.,22,   &quot;      An alternative suggestion has been made that we mightredistribute our forces within the Middle East area,  sinceeven a partial withdraw! from Egypt might have some value in improving our relations with Italy.,    Any such proposalmust be judged in the light of the following considerationsr-Even if we ourselves could be satisfied as to thegenuineness of Italian   assurances it is most unlikely that the Egyptians would be equallyconfidents    So long as the Egyptians fearItalian attack they would be unlikely r.o agreeto any reduction In our land or air forces inEgypt.We nave giver the Government of India an under- i..-vtaking that Indian troops in the Middle Eastwill not be located in Palestine, where theymight&apos;be involved in internal distrubances,unless that country :i s threatened by externalattack.-. Of a total of rc-oghl.y three, divisions in Egypt,, one is an Indian, division,     ......._______Even if we could satisfy the Egyptians and get their consent to withdrawal of substantial numbers to Palestine, we should still be at a -great.military disadvantage,.    The whole essence of the defence of Egypt is the necessity of forestalling the Italians in the western desert,.    Distance for- distance the advantagelies with them for the following reasons.-(i)    The Italians could at any time recon-concentrate on their frontier withoutinforming us and probably without our knowledge,(ii)    If the forces cjii which we depend for thedefence of Egypt were located largely in Palestine,  there would be twobottle-necks, the single line railwayend the crossing of the Suez Canal,between our main forces and the western desert.    Air attack, which could be verysudden on these corarmini cat ions, and sabotage to which the railway isparticularly liable, might effectivelyhamper our concentration and prevent us geeting our troops to the WesternIt(a)(h)(o)

No redistribution of land or air forces involving areduction in the garrison of Egypt can therefore berecomraendedo23. From the above therefore we conclude(a) Withdrawal&quot;by us of forces from the Middle Eastarea as a whole would be strategically unsound.It is indeed our&apos;intended policy to build upadditional forces tliers.(b) No redistribution of forces within the area is tobe recorrmehid-eds24. It is possible that the French might be prepared toconsider a withdrawal of troops from North Africa for somequid pro quo in Libya from the Italians.    Their problem is notthe same as ours in that they can reinforce Africa again more quickly than we can, although not so quickly as the Italianscan.    Moreover the North African garrison constitutes ish-eia? OTiljrimmediate reserve outsid.e France for use in case of needagainst German attackssGeneral Conclusions.25. To sum up :-(i) It would, be impossible to neutralise theMediterranean since the Germans are fullyentitled to extend their submarine activitiesinto that seac    In any event the neutralisationof the Mediterranean and. the abandonment of contraband Control within that sea would resultin a breakdown of the economic pressure uponwhich we mainly rely for the ultimate defeat ofGermany.(ii) Any restrictions, on the strength of our forces inthe Middle East as a whole would cut across ourpresent policy of building up a reserve in that area.    We have to be prepared to meet threatsIn the Balkans and in Asia,  quite apart fromthe menace of Italian attack on Egypt.(iii) The transfer of a portion of the Egyptian garrisonto other parts of the Middle East would be unsoundfrom a military point of view owing to thedifficulty of rapidly reinforcing the western desert.

(iv) If the War Cabinet consider that any useful purpose would he served bypursuing the question of a reduction of italian forces in Libya on the basis of acorresponding reduction of French forces in north Africa,, the French will have to be consulted.(Sgd.)
