ANNEX.,DRAFT TELEGRAM FOR DESPATCH TO PRIME ministers of AUSTRALIA. NEW ZEALAND. CANADA. SOUTHAFRICA AND TO THE GOVERNOR GENERALOF INDIA.1*     Most secret and Personal.     In reply- to requestrecently received for advice &quot;as to the military position which would he created in the event of Russia declaring war and co-operating with Germany in military action&quot;,following Appreciation has been prepared:-2o       It should be stated at the outset that His Majesty^s.Government in the United Kingdom consider it unlikelythat Russia will adopt this course for the following reasons:-(i) She is in process of realising her ambitionsin the Baltic^ has barred the German path to roumania and the Black Sea, has extended her influence in SeE*Europe and, acting through Turkey, will px&quot;storage&quot;bly be ableto exclude the naval forces of other countries from the black Seao     All this has been achieved without war andits accompanying riskso(ii) Her abiding aim is to spread world revolutionsTo achieve that object her policy is likely to be to induceGermany and other countries to exhaust themselves in war,while herself remaining outside the struggle.(iii) Too close a co-operation between Russia andGermany is likely to antagonise Italy, Spain and portugal and thus to encourage the building up against russia of a new political coalition..

3... Assuming that, despite the above, Russia decidesto fight on Germany-&apos; s side, the salient features of themilitary position which would arise ore summarised in the paragraphs that follow.4.     At sea submarine warfare would probably be intensifiedin home waters.    More determined action by German surfacevessels would hove to be expected and the availability ofthe ice-free port of Murmansk would broaden the base of theenemy1s operations.   A minor thro t to British;trade might develop in the Pacific.5.    On land and in the air direct military co-operationWith Germany seems unlikely on any appreciable scale.Germany already has large land forces and a preponderancein aircraft, and there would be political dangers in theacceptance of Russian troops on German soil.     russia might, however, supply some technical troops and certain types of aircraft for use on the Western Pront.6.        In the economic sphere Russian support would slowup the effect of our economic pressure on Germany, who might feel she.could afford to play a waiting game on thewestern front in the hope that pressure of neutral

opinion and of our own peoples would compel us tomake peace while her military strength was stillunimpaired.     At the same time any economic assistance which Russia might render to German;/ wouldcorrespondingly restrict her own military activities and vie e ver s a.7. Russian propaganda, which is an immediatemenace to our interests, would be intensified;,particularly in the Middle East.      By the use ofthis weapon combined with military action she couldcause us serious embarrassment by locking up allied forces in secondary theatres, and in particular Iran,Iraq and Afghanistan.8. So far as Iran is concerned, Russia could easily penetrate both with propaganda and with smallmilitary forces into the Northern Provinces, and suchpenetration might develop into a throat to theAnglo-Iranian oil fields, which we should have to resist.

9.        Russian penetration in Iran would of itself causedisturbances in Iraq, and a further advance would threaten the Mosul Oilfields and our overland communications fromthe Persian Gulf to Egvpi4     We should be bound to resist any such advance,10.       Russia might absorb the Northern Provinces of afghanistan, and the consequent unrest fostered bypropaganda would probably spread to India.     In addition,Russia might undertake long range air action against objectives in India.     Although any large scale attacksare unlikely even a light scale would make the internal security problem acute0     No reinforcements could then bedrawn from India,,     On the contrary there might be callsfrom India for land and air reinforcements, particularly the latter.11.       Unless Italy were definitely friendly, thedespatch of adequate forces, particularly air forces, &quot;toIran, Iraq and India would be extremely difficult.      $Butsee paras. 2 and 14j.12.       Even if Russia did not openly fight on Germany&apos;aside but were benevolently neutral towards her, many ofthe embarrassments summarised in the paragraphs 4-10would operate, though in some cases to a reduced extent.13,       It will be seen from the above that a close association between Germany and Russia would have seriousmilitary implications,     On the other hand this association can be bought by Germany only (by theabandonment of Nazi principles and by sacrificingGerman interests in the Baltic and S.E. Europe.     This maywell lead to a revulsion of feeling in Germany which may

9 &amp; K&amp; 0 -3bring Russo-German antagonism to the surface sooner1 thanHerr Hitler intendse At the same time this associationcan only be bought by Russia at the expense of herprinciples, and the abandonment of these will antagoniseall that independent public opinion in outside countries who have hitherto been sympathetic towards the Communistregime and ideals014c       Elsewhere, particularly in the Mediterranean areaj,the UoSoAo and in Roman Catholic countries generallyssentiment is likely to be influenced in our favour*     in short, we may later be in a position to mobilise world opinion to rally to a Christian front as against anti-Christian forceso15*       Request referred to in paragraph 1 above wasLpnt received from Prime Minister of Commonwealth of Australia,fstr-alia)This appreciation is being telegraphed to him and toother Prime Ministers0\ Australia   15o       This Appreciation is being telegraphed also toUy).other Prime Ministersc
