(39) 82.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND : KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE EFFECT OF THE DROPPING OF LEAFLETS IN GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN accordance with the conclusions reached by the War Cabinet on the2nd October (39 (34), Minute 2), I circulate to my colleagues a memorandumsummarising the information available as to the effect of the dropping of leafletsin Germany, together with a memorandum by Sir Campbell Stuart summarising the arguments in favour of continuing this practice.H.Foreign Office, October 9, 1939.Memorandum foe the War Cabinet summarising the Available information regarding the effect of the dropping of leaflets in germany.OUR information, which is necessarily fragmentary, comes from (1) foreign government, (2) private sources in neutral countries, and (3) our own secretsources.  The greatest weight attaches to the first category of reports.(1) Foreign Governments.A. U nfavourable.Denmark.On the 11th September the Danish Minister in London said that, as a sincerefriend of this country, he much regretted the damage which was being done toour position in neutral countries by the dropping of leaflets since this placedneutral Governments and populations in a difficult and embarrassing position.Holland.On the 10th September the Dutch General Staff stated that in their opinionmore harm than good was being done by leaflet dropping. Our leaflets only gave the impression in Germany that we were not pursuing the war seriously andwere afraid to arouse reprisals. The same impression prevailed in friendly and neutral countries (this was confirmed by our own secret reports : see under (3) Abelow).Belgmm.The British Embassy at Brussels was informed confidentially by the BelgianForeign Office on the 13th September that the Belgian Ambassador in Berlinhad reported that the effect of the leaflets was the opposite to that which theBritish Government desired.   They had only aroused German memories of 191810618   [20108] b
when they had been urged to get rid of their Government, but had not benefitedby so doing. The Belgian Consul at Cologne and German deserters in Belgiumhad sent similar reports. The Belgian Ambassador in London and the BelgianMilitary Attache in Paris spoke on similar lines on the 23rd September and the27th September respectively.The Belgian, Dutch and Danish Governments have all complained about theaccidental dropping of leaflets on their territory. As it seems to be impossible toavoid this, the irritation caused to these well-disposed neutrals is an important factor to be taken into consideration.France.On the 10th September the French General Staff, while admitting that therewere two opinions on the subject, said that they thought our leaflets had convinced the German people that we did not mean to fight seriously and that they had alsodiscouraged our Polish allies.B. Favourable.Greece.On the 23rd September the Greek Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed HisMajesty&apos;s Minister that the dropping of leaflets had had a great effect accordingto their information from Berlin.(2) Private Sources in Neutral Countries.A. Unfavourable.Denmark.His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Copenhagen reported on the 8th September thatreliable neutrals arriving from Berlin all took the view that the British. leafletshad an unfortunate effect. Unless bombs were also dropped the Germans would think that Great Britain and France were afraid to fight.Yugoslavia.On the 10th September His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Belgrade said that theGerman propaganda was making great play with our leaflet dropping, andpointing out in particular its uselessness to our Polish allies. Sir B. Campbellrecommended from the point of view of opinion in neutral States that if the leaflets must be dropped, we should not mention the fact in our broadcasts.Holland.A report of the 12th September from Amsterdam quoted a German who hadbeen in Holland during one of our raids as saying that no one in germany would dare to look at the leaflets.According to a further Amsterdam report of the 18th September, animportant German business man had said that the pamphlets had no effect and only convinced the German people that Great Britain was not serious. TheGerman propagandists had been delighted that we had provided them with sucha useful line of internal propaganda.A further Amsterdam report of the 25th September confirmed the two previous reports.Egypt.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo has reported widespread criticism ofour pamphlet dropping among the foreign communities in Egypt.Belgium.A report of the 25th September quoted a Belgian business man with goodcontacts in Germany as reporting that he had heard no mention of the Britishleaflets during a visit to Germany.
B. Favourable.Denmark.His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Copenhagen on the 13th September reported that,although the style of the earlier leaflets had been criticised, the German Partyauthorities seemed to be afraid of their possible effects. According to a GermanRoman Catholic priest, the leaflets were much sought after.Sivitzerland.His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Basle forwarded on the 13th September reports that,although the German upper classes were scornful of our pamphlets, the lowerclasses were impressed by this proof of the potentialities of the R.A.F.Holland.According to the Amsterdam report of the 25th September already quoted above, the leaflets had at least had the effect of surprising the German people inthat the British aircraft had in fact been able to cross the frontier.(3) Our Own Secret Sources.A. Unfavourable.According to a report of the 11th September, the M.1.5 representative in holland agreed that the Dutch General Staff thought the effect of our pamphletshad been most unfortunate. The German people were contemptuous of them andirritated by them. It was, however, suggested that a more objective type ofpamphlet which did not personally attack Herr Hitler might be successful.B. Favourable.A report of the 17th September quoted unofficial neutrals of no greatstanding as having reported that the leaflets had had some effect upon the manin the street in Germany.According to another secret report of the 17th September, a Dutch resident in Berlin stated that the third pamphlet had been effective as compared with thefirst two, which had been complete failures.According to a report of the 24th September from a competent channel intouch with representatives of the German middle class not normally favourable to the Nazis, the effect of the pamphlets might be insidious, although they hadnot been very successful so far.A well-placed German source, who has proved very reliable in the past,said at the end of September that the dropping of leaflets instead of bombs had&apos;done much to convince the German people that the British were sincere in statingthat they were not fighting the German people, but only the Nazi regime. Thefact that the Allied aircraft had been able to enter Germany in spite of theso-called invincible German defences had also had a good effect. In the opinionof this source, propaganda and economic warfare were the Allies&apos; most potent,weapons. The leaflets would be more useful if they were shorter and in biggerprint.As a doubtful case, it might be mentioned that, according to Sir CampbellStuart&apos;s principal German expert, the first full mention of Mr. Knickerbocker&apos;scharges of corruption against German leaders was only given publicity in theGerman press and wireless immediately after the first dropping of the leafletscontaining these charges, although these were dropped three days after thecharges had first been made. It is, however, arguable whether this wasadvantageous or not, since it might have been better not to have provoked a publicrefutation in Germany, but to have allowed insidious rumours to percolate from neutral countries and to spread secretly without any reply from the GermanGovernment.It can be argued that it is yet too soon to pass judgment on this wholequestion. It is generally agreed that the first leaflets, which had to be put out at very short notice, were not entirely successful and that the whole position was[20108] b 2
prejudiced by the unnecessary dropping of leaflets over neutral countries. the later leaflets have, however, been more vigorous, and seem to have been more effective. With experience the leaflet writers are learning their business in thelight of the actual war conditions. At this stage, when the Germans have notyet really felt the effects of war, owing to their easy victories in the East and the comparative calm in the West, the leaflets cannot be expected to have animmediate and devastating effect. For the time being they have concentrated upon the useful task of exposing the Nazi leaders and the S.S., &amp;c. more constructive propaganda will be possible when our own war effort on the western front and elsewhere is more apparent.Foreign Office, October 9, 1939.Memorandum by Sir Campbell Stuart&apos;s Department.j .... .SINCE the outbreak of hostilities five leaflets have been disseminated inGermany. Three of them were general in character; one was the Prime Ministersbroadcast; and one contained allegations against Nazi leaders of having placedmoney abroad. A number of others have been drafted and are ready for issue -when required. Sir Campbell Stuart has naturally been most anxious to obtain information of the reception accorded to his Departments efforts in Germany,and has sought evidence of it in the wireless and press of Germany and neutral countries and in the reports he receives from Service and secret sources.Reference by Goring to British leaflets and the drastic and extensive measures taken to prevent their being read by the German public have clearly indicated that the Nazi Government regard them as an effective weapon. Sir Campbellhas, moreover, reason to suspect that an attempt to counteract the propagandaof his Department by German leaflets which purport to emanate from GreatBritain has begun.  This matter is being investigated at the moment.The German press and wireless have made few references to British leafletsexcept as an echo of G6ring&apos;s speech. The American wireless has containedfavourable references; the Italian wireless, on the other hand, has not mentionedleaflets. The French press has also been generally favourable. The Dutch,Danish and Swiss press have published full translations of the texts. On thewhole, however, few indications of value have been received from these sources.According to information from private sources abroad, many of the judg-ments passed upon the merits of British leaflets have been coloured by the&apos;&apos; leaflet versus bomb &quot; controversy, and as a result leaflets have in some quartersbeen regarded with unfair disfavour.Certain of the secret reports received have indicated that the first distribu-tion of leaflets aroused considerable interest and discussion. They have undoubtedly had a &quot;novelty&quot; value. For instance, news from Berlin given inan M.I. 1 (b) report indicated that recipients had been considerably impressed.Similar intelligence was received from Aachen. Further reports indicate thatthe later leaflets have made a stronger appeal than the earlier. On the otherhand, there have been -suggestions that some Germans have regarded leafletdistribution as a sign of weakness. Such conflict, however, as exists in the reports received may well be explained by the fact that, whilst certain types of Germans,to whom the leaflets are particularly addressed, are impressed, others are not.This, however, is only to be expected in view of the conditions which prevailin Germany.News from France that British leaflets have been found on prisoners has ledto enquiries from the French military authorities, inasmuch as a questionnairefor prisoners had been furnished to them some time ago, but no reply has yet beenreceived. It is hoped that, as the number of prisoners captured increases, infor-mation far more detailed and accurate than any hitherto received will be obtained.The following reasons support the view that propaganda by leaflets shouldnot be interrupted except for serious cause. It is not to be expected that, untildeep divisions appear in Germany, propaganda can do more than sow doubts andmisgivings.  The effects at which it aims will, however, only be achieved by steady
and persistent effort. It may, at the moment and for some time, be impossible to hope for more than the establishment of a reputation for trustworthiness; butit would be an achievement indeed to realise this aim.The deliberate policy which has governed the efforts of Sir Campbell Stuart&apos;department cannot be divulged to the public and at the same time kept from theenemy. Unless, however, it is explained, his leaflets are likoly to be judged in thiscountry as independent exercises rather than as steps towards a clear objective.As the war intensifies, both the scale and variety of his activities seem certain toincrease and, consequently, the difficulties of explanation will be enhanced. Thereare, therefore, strong reasons for keeping these activities beyond the range ofparliamentary questions and open controversy in the newspapers.The decision of the Government to make the terms of British leaflets actuallydistributed in Germany available to members of Parliament and to allow them tobe published in the Press may have been inevitable, in view of the apparentreasonableness of the argument that it would be absurd to keep from the british public matter freely given to its enemies. It has, however, had some unfortunateeffects. The criterion by which leaflets should be judged is, of course, the Germanversion. The public, which is generally ignorant both of German and theGerman mentality, naturally judges the leaflets from British standpoints. Atany time public controversy in regard to a particular leaflet which offendsparticular British susceptibilities may arise. Such a controversy would obviouslygive the German propagandists an excellent opening. The fact that leaflets havenow to be considered from the point of view of Parliament and the Press as wellas that of the German reader presents, of course, an additional difficulty to thosewho draft them.Leaflets, moreover, may often have to be prepared in the light of informationnot generally available to the public and, indeed, unsuitable in the public interest for public disclosure. Their purpose, therefore, may easily be misunderstood. Itmust also be remembered that there is an inevitable anomaly in giving publicity tothe output of a secret Department and thus challenging discussion of its methods.
