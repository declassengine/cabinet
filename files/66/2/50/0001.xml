COPTS EC R El20th October, 1939.GeQ.,GrLe General Commandant en Chef&amp;es Forces Terrestres.Wo, 90 Cab/FTMy dear Friend,Prom the information which I have received (Note l) it wouldappear to me that the German High Command intends to increase.se the numberof its formations by raisiiiv additional divisions.   For each activedivision there would &quot;be a new &quot;divioion de forsaation&quot;.   Apparently ourenemy&apos;s programme of reinforcement is to be carried out at the latest bynest Spring.The German Array would then have a total of about- 160 divisions of which at least 120 - 130 could be employed on the yestern Front.To guard against such an increase of hostile forces I havealready withdrawn a certain number of units from the Army of the Alps andfrom North Africa for use in the North-Eastern Theatre of Operations.of North Africa., however,  denen&amp;s essentially on the attitude of Italy whichat present remains uncertain.In the event of this Power declaring herself hostile, a large partof the division- withdrawn from the Alps and from Tunisia would have to beIn addition I have ordered the examination of the conditions inwhich the new formations -may be constituted^The effort which the French Arm; &apos; will be called upon to make mightThe withdrawal of the major part of tha forces in the South-Bastsent back (as ffar as the Alps are concerned anyhow by the Spring) 0entail the formation o:if 10 new divisions.It is essential that the british army-ote 1.information which no doubt you also have received.

Army should assist so that we way be in a position next Spring, to opposeour enemies with forces at least comparable to theirs .Moreover according- to the figures which have been communicated tome, the general total of your land forces would bo about 930,000 men(including 130,000 overseas),,   Ha van; deducted the 160,000 men of theBritish lixpeditionary Force, there would remain in Great Britain for- the52 divisions, for the formation of which you have provided, a strength ofabout 650,000 men which might prove incidentally to be inadequate.I therefore deem it necessary to ask you to consider:-first, a speeding up of the realization of the initial programmeenvisaged,then, the formation of additional formations0I do not think, in that respect, that you will meet any seriousobstacle regarding the numbers and their training.     On the other hand theprovision of armament material is liable to raise certain difficulties.Gould they not be overcome partly by an intensification of manufacture,and partly by placing orders abroad?While submitting these suggestions to you, allow me to emphasizeonce more the necessity of the common effort which we must undertake inregard to effective strengths so that we may- not find ourselves thiscoming Spring, in a dangerous state of inferiority in face of the german forces*-  Yours very sincerely(Sgd.)     M. Gamelin.P.S.     I am attaching a copy of a Note of the 14th October? 193.9,, -drawnup by my 2s.tsm&amp; Bureau on  he available German personnel.

It attains for personnel between the ageof 20 and 48 a total of about 11,000,000 men (personnelphysically fit - Czech personnel not included) see attachedtable.Some 6,000,000 men would therefore still be available.These sources theoretically consists mainly of thefollowing elementsA. Young element.Glasses of young men born in 1918 and 1919  (21 and 20 yearsof age)  already registered and medically sxarai ned  (note l)B. Adult element.Glasses 1911 and 1912 (27 and 28 years of age) who have not done their compulsory training: (pe.ce.nily Y*Q.$istered)/1,025,000 men.Classes 1908 and 1909 (30 and 31 years of age,&apos; neither trainednor registered yet.1,500,000 men.Note 1.  their incorporation was expected In the Autumn of 1939,except for the third batch of the 1919 classes which was postponed to the following year., -1-- .

The demands made upon thenormal effectives represents 5 0 to 3-3&quot;% .With regard to the mere problem of labour it was possible to  -apply the mobilisation measures taken so far by the Germanswithout any great repercussion on the economic life of thecountry and in any case without introducing a seriousmodification in the mode of external life Inaugurated by theGerman policy of aggression since March 193o,(Sgdo)    ORAUCHE.Various reports indicate even that certain men of over40 years, of age mobilised in the liRSATZ have been recently returned, to their hea3?ths.

DRAFT LETTER Jg.Ojj._TES. CHIEF OF THE II.SERIAL GBlMlgRAL STAFF TO GENERAL GAiXELISI have read your letter of the 20th October, in which you refer bothe number of divisions of which the Germans will be able to dispose next:Spring, with great interest.We are in general agreement with your conclusions that they are capable of waking an enormous land, effort, a3.though we are doubtful ifsufficient allowance of fit men has been made for the requirements ofindustry, and further you appear to have made no allowance whatever forwastage.     However, we will examine your figures and let you have any commentowhich &quot;nay be of value. \As regards our own effort, I think you have omitted in yourcalculations to take account of the British Expeditionary Force now inFrance, for having deducted the 160,000 men who are now in France from the930,000 men which you assume to be the total of our land forces you conclude that only 650,000 men remain over for the 52 divisions.     But of these 32divisions 5 are already in France and if your total of 650,000 were, right itwould represent the number available for 27 divisions and not for 52.You would like me, however, to point out what is the actual position.     Thetotal of our land forces in Britain next month will be about 855,000, and v;eshall continue to call up further quota.ssYou ask me to consider a speeding up of the realisation of the initial programme envisaged.     This we have already done to the extent ofmore than one division.     My Secretary of State authorises me to say thathis colleagues in the V:rar Cabinet are, without qualification, impressed with the supreme importance of ensuring that there should be an adequateAllied force in France and this as quickly as possible.     You are, ofcourse, aware of the considerable forces which we are maintaining to coverour commitments throughout the world, notably in t.-.e Par and Middle Bist.At the present stage, however, it is not man-power or our ability to trainit which limits the rate of our expansion.     The limiting factor is the  .speed with which industry can produce the equipment required.      In this.... 1 field/

field there is intense activity and our aim is the creation at theearliest possible date of the largest British Army which can be effectively maintained., &quot;......This brings me to your second request - the establishment eladditional formationg^-^My Secretary of State authorises me, on behalf /of the T/ar Cabinet, to say that the 32 divisions which you mention do not represent the whole of the forces which will eventually be created.     &apos;.Veare awaiting the latest -forecasts for the output of material from theMinistry of Supply and this mil enable us to formulate with more precisionithe future dates for the despatch of furtner contingents./&apos; &apos; * 0 &apos; i iAt a later stage it will be possible to give you more details and I feel sure that you Vvdll be impressed by the magnitude of the effort which Great Britain is making.      You may be without any doubt that we are all whole-heartedly anxious to ploy our part in every way to the maximum of our strength.
