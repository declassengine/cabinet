THE&apos; HEED BJZWZ^VTuJ.Ig&amp;O&amp;VlTOUH^BY -TH^-(W,l?-i4 . rjZIEE OffNAVAL StfAgg.A glance at a chart of the Atlantic &quot;Till show howships carising trace from- all over the world converge tothe Southward of Ireland and the approaches to the english channel.In this area there are at any time more ships andmore valrtable cargoes to he found than anywhere else inthe world.      These ships include not only those bringingtrade to England and Scotland, but also those bringingtrade to Ireland, which is largely passed through liverpool and other English &quot;Test Coast ports and. subsequently trans-shipped in smaller ships across the Irish Sea.-Since the present war started, an unrelentingU-boat attack has &quot;been tailing place on this trade., and. this attack has recently &quot;been intensified.      Immediate measures were taken to put the shipping into. .cxuiv-oy and.to -escortthose convoys by anti-submarine craft.      The number ofshdps--avaiilable for--aaaovt.. work is-, however^--f-a^b.edow--ther3miire!!iont? and. many ships and- groups of ships have tocome in unescorted because of the lack of these vessels.The recent threat of air attack on our East Coast trade has also made it essential to withdraw a. number&apos; ofescorting craft from the western Approaches.     Further,...... ^owing to the same shortage of escorting craft, it is notpossible to take the eon^oya out aa far to the V/estwardas could, be wished..      The U-boats have recently realisedthis weakness due to lack of escorting craft and they have&apos; - -been operating further and further out to attack the shipswhen unescorted,,

Our patrolling aircraft, are also a most importantweapon against the submarine,- hrt their range is limited andthe submarines are now operating outside the area that they canpatrol.It has now become imperative that we should escort ourconvoys both inwards and outwards to and from a position further to the Westward;    working as we are from Plymouth and milford haven it is impracticable to do this.      Our destroyers andother escorting vessels have since the beginning of the war       ,been running at their extreme capacity,     1:1 any of the vesselsthemselves are now beginning to show the signs of strain, andtheir crews&apos; are worked to the extremity of human endurancefrom lack of sleep and rest.      It Is not possible to produce the extra destroyers and escort vessels to relieve the situation,and with the coming of the winter months, and t?ae far worseweather to be expected compared to that which has prevailedsince the outbreak of war, the situation must go from bad toworse unless something can be donee      There is one way in whichthis situation can be drastically and quickly relieved, andthat is by the Eire Government giving the use of one or more of their ports to the Royal Navy and the Royal Air&quot;&apos;Force.Berehaven is the most suitable port.The Southern coast of Ireland is by nature placed in aposition to control the approaches to the English Channel, andwith escorting craft and other craft based on this port, itwould be possible to escort our trade many miles farther tothe Westward, thereby immensely increasing safety.      Similarlyflying boats operating from this port can provide security bydriving the U-boats under very much farther to the West thanwhen they are operating from English ports0     The sufferingand loss caused Ky the U-boats in the last six weeks have been serious, but the comparatively fine weather that has prevailed

throughout this period has greatly reduced the toll of &quot;human;V;valife.     With the winter months, this situation must change,and the chances of survival of the passengers and crew of anyship torjhedoed in the weather that is to ho expected are veryremote*A new threat has recently arisen to our shipping In theform of Warships or raider attack on the high seas.-    One ofthese raiders is at large to-day,  and. others may appear atany momentb      In the face of this hew threat, it has become necessary to escort our convoys in open waters &quot;by surfacewarships i.e. battleships and cruisers0     These warships comeright across&apos; the Atlantic, but when they rdach the U-boat areatheir duty is over,  ana they themselves need an anti-U-boatescort, thus further drawing on our limited, resources.     Wereit possible for these ships to proceed, be oiled and turnedround at Berehaven instead, of Plymouth, a great deal of unnecesary steaming through submarine infested waters weald &quot;be&apos;avoidedwith consequent reduction to risk and the release of escort-ing vessels to assist further in the protection of trade.All these reasons make it of vital Importance that theport which is naturally situated to control these waters shallbe available for the use of the Navy which protects Irish asp&apos;well as British tra.de and. soil.(intl&apos;d. )
