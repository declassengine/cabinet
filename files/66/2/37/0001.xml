8 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .87.olslSlIIIITO BE KEPT UNDERTOOK AMD KEY.It h requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET,COPY NO.    I^fAIR OPERATIONS IN THE EVENT OF A german invasion OF THE LOW COUNTRIES.(Previous reference: W,P,-(S9) 45 (Also Paper No.0.0.8.  (59)  45))&quot;.Memorandum by, thev Chief s of Staff Committee.1. It will be recalled that the War Cabinet attheir Meeting on the 23rd September35 had before them aReport by the Chiefs of Staff on the subject of air operations in the event of a German invasion of the low countries, from which the following is an extract..it will be impossible to subject theGerman columns to the full weight of our.air attack without causing casualties toDutch and Belgium soldiers and civilians.7.     Nevertheless we emphasise that theopportunitsr of inflicting&apos; a real blow onthe enemy will be a fleeting one, and thatour Commanders will run the risk of lettingit slip,  if they do not have the discretion to put their pre-arranged plans intooperation immediately they get certain information of the German movement.8.     We therefore ask for authority to giveour Commanders this discretion.&quot;2. The War Cabinet agreed:-&quot;(l) That the Foreign Secretary should be invitedto renew his representations to the BelgiumGovernment as to the need for initiating staff conversations forthwith, in the most emphaticmanner,  and. that no possible room for doubtshould be left in Belgian minds as to thereason why, in out view,  such conversationswere essential.(2) to defer a decision on the recommendations made by. the Chiefs of Staff in their Reportuntil after the receipt of the Belgian replyto (l) above,  and &quot;until fuller information v\rasobtained as to the Belgian plans.&quot;s W.M.(39) 24th Conclusions, Minute 11.

3&apos; In spite of the explanations that have beengiven to the Belgian authorities both in London and in brussels, there seems little likelihood of theiragreeing to Staff Convorsations or of our being able toobtain any fuller details of their plans than we have atpresent *4. There are no new factors -affecting the considerations set out in our Report referred to above,except that the British Army is now in the line, andthe possibility/ of attack more imminent.     The essence of the problem is that, if the Germans start a majoroffensive, either through Belgium or through Luxembourg,they must be checked from the outsat by the Royal AirForce in co-operation with the French Air Force.5. The air plans for this operation have been worked out in detail;    but  If they are to be effective it mustbe possible to implement them at the right moment.Even a few hours&apos;  delay might cause this fleetingopportunity, which would not recur,  to be lost.    Inthese circumstances there will be no time for discussion6. We therefore ask, as a matter of urgency, for adecision by the War Cabinet as to whether we and ourCommanders may have discretion to put our pre-arrangedplans for checking the German advance at the outset intooperation immediately we obtain certain information ofthe German movement,(Signed; 0.1:.IT.
