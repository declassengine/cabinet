gpTRjOGUMSMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,SECRET. WAR CABINET.WoPo(59)- 67. COPY NO.      24Action by Gorman destroyers in removing from aSwedish ship rescued British Seamen.NOTE BY THE FIRST LORD.Last week a Swedish ship rescued eleven Britishsurvivors from a British ship sunk by a U-boat,      A German seaplanewhich witnessed the incident reported it to Germany, and two destroyerscame up, and took the eleven British merchant-seamen prisoners,carrying them off to internment for the duration.       A minor official of the Ministry of Information rang up a junior in the Press-section in the Admiralty, who without the slightest authority said, informallyover the telephone, as his personal opinion, that the Germans werewithin their rights in taking this step.     This was immediatelypublished.-      To-day at the Cabinet the Foreign Secretary showed methis statement, attributed to the Admiralty, and published in the newspapers.       Thus y/e are made to condone an outrage at sea, followed up by a vindictive pursuit, and giving encouragement to furtherill-usage.     We are made to do this at the very time that we havelet large numbers of Germans of military age go freely out of theUnited Kingdom, and when we are not taking Germans of military agefrom the many ships that come into our hands unless they aretechnicians or suspected agents.I Venture to clear up this point with my colleagues.(Intd.) W.S.C.30th September,1939.
