naval SITUATION.North Sea.THE principal item of naval interest during the past week was an encounterbetween British naval forces and German aircraft. On the 8th October aircraftsighted a German force, consisting of one battleship, with three cruisers and two destroyers, off the Norwegian Coast proceeding northwards. British naval forces were disposed to intercept them, and a force of 12 Wellington bombing aircraftleft to attack, but failed to locate them in bad visibility and returned. TheGermans are believed to have turned back during the night the 8th/ 9th October,and returned via the Kattegat.52. On the 9th October the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, with destroyers in company, whilst carrying out a sweep off the Norwegian coast in connection withthe above incident, was bombed by German aircraft intermittently over a periodof about four hours without effect, although over 100 bombs were dropped. Atleast four separate high-level bombing attacks were made by groups of six aircraft and one dive bombing attack by a single aircraft.3. During the week German aircraft also attacked two minesweepers offLowestoft and a destroyer in the North Sea. Reports have been received that german flying boats are frequently &quot;seen by trawlers in an area about 50 miles off Cromer.4. Three German destroyers or cruisers&apos; were reported by aircraft about100 miles to the Eastward of the Shetland Islands on the 7th October, butfurther search in bad visibility failed to produce any contact with this force.On the 10th October there was some activity by German light forces off the,Dutch coast, apparently in connexion with the movement of German shippingbetween German and Dutch ports.German Attack on Trade.5. A small ship the Glen Farg (876 tons), which was sunk off the Orkneys and a trawler the A Isey, sunk off blyth--are the only known British victims of U-boat attack during the week. The Loch Goil (9,482 tons) struck a floatingmine in the Bristol Channel but was beached off Swansea.6.   Neutral losses were as follows : Dutch s.s. Binnendijk (6,873 tons), sunk off Portland by either torpedoor mine.Finnish s.s. Indra (1,999 tons), mined off Terschelling.Swedish s.s. Visttda (1,018 tons), sunk by U-boat off the Shetland Islands.7.   The total losses since the beginning of the war are as follows :  Totalgross tonnage.27 136,4223 13,0311 5,0511 21032 154,714Also six fishing vessels.8. It is now considered certain that the ship which sank the s.s. Clementoff Pernambuco on the 30th September is the Admiral Scheer. No further attacks have been reported. A Norwegian ship reported having encountered an armed raider on the 28th September 200 miles E. of Bahia. It is believed this may have been the Schivabenland.By submarineBy mine by surface craftCause unknown
9.   Without making allowance for losses, the number of U-boats estimatedbe in service now -is 78, of which 28 are of the very small type.  The anticipatedfuture totals are : January 1940    ...      ......      ...      ...      102March 1940       .;.      ...       ...........    122Anti-Submarine Operations. &apos;: ^^-H^410. The weather has been unfavourable for anti-submarine activity duringthe past week. Six attacks on presumed submarine contacts Were. carried out between the 5th and 7th October, of which two were by aircraft and one by a french patrol boat. It seems unlikely that any damage was done to the U-boatsjn any of these attacks. :        - ,On the 11th October there were one or two submarine reports, one off Cromer,one off Tyne. On the 12th October the trawler Lochtula attacked a submarine in liverpool Bay, and the hunt was subsequently taken up by two destroyers withpromising results.       *Mining.12.   The Dover barrage is nearly completed.13. Many floating mines have been reported in the southern part of theNorth Sea. A large number have drifted on shore in Suffolk and Essex : sixteenof these are definitely German, some are Dutch, others British. No doubt the hard gales of the last week account for this.Casualties.14. Destroyers Escapade and Vivacious collided leaving. Mil-ford Haven.The Troopships Francpnia and Alcantara which were in collision in theMediterranean whilst in convoy will require two weeks and one week respectively to effect repairs.Convoys..15. Ships from the West Indies are being evasively routed to Halifax,there to join the Halifax convoys which will be strongly escorted. Many french ships are sailing in British convoys. Sierra Leone convoys are being escorted by both British and Trench warships. Over 1,300 ships have been sailed in convoysince the commencement of hostilities and no ship in convoy has yet been lost by enemy action. Arrangements have been made for the co-operation of british aircraft in case of attacks on convoys passing up and down the East Coast.German Merchant Shipping.16. The Northern Patrol cruisers have captured the Cap Norte, a Germanliner of 13,000 tons, which was returning from Brazil with a cargo of petroleum and food-stuffs. This is the biggest German ship taken so far, and is the secondship to be captured at sea that has not scuttled herself.17. Six German merchant ships have reached Norwegian waters from the atlantic during the week under review, including two of over 13,000 tons. Fortyare now believed to be at sea outside European waters, and many of these are nodoubt trying to make for Germany. In addition, 270 German merchant ships were believed to be still in neutral ports on the 10th October. Of these it isbelieved that 47 are capable of being converted to armed merchantmen.Economic Warfare.18. Bad weather has seriously handicapped the work of Contraband Control.Sixty-seven neutral ships are at present under examination in the three detentionports of the United Kingdom. The total tonnage of cargo seized in prize in GreatBatOain up to the 7th October is 314,888 tons.[20130] b 2
South American Division.19. The strict application of the neutrality regulations in S. America,which from our point of view is very desirable in order to restrict enemy activities&apos;may somewhat hamper the activities of our S. American Division and make itnecessary to make fuller use of the Falkland Islands.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.British Eexpeditionary Force.20. The 2nd Corps and remaining G.H.Q. Troops have now moved forward,and, by the 12th October, the B.E.F., with the 51st French Division undercommand, will have completed the taking over of the Lille sector of the french frontier defences, from -Maulde (north of St. Amand) to Armentieres.German Movements.21. German operations on the Western Front have been confined throughoutthe week to minor attacks and reconnaissances in the area between the Rhine andthe Moselle.  There have been no operations south of Karlsruhe.More interest attaches to the moves of German reinforcements and thedevelopment of German fortifications. A total of 126 German divisions has been identified. Of these, 58 divisions (as opposed to 52 a week ago) are known to beon the Western Front, and elements of a further 20 divisions have been indentified in the same theatre.   The distribution of these divisions is believed to be asfollows : Minimum.    Maximum,.North Sea to excl. of Kleve      ...... 2 2inch Kleve to incl. Aachen     &apos;...... 14 24excl. Aachen to R. Mosel        ...... 10 12R. Mosel to R. Rhine     ......... 21 27Upper Rhine front         ...      ... -    ... 11 15Total     ......      ... 58 78Note. Elements of each of two divisions have been reported in two differentsectors.   Hence the maximum figure is reduced from 80 to 78.It will be seen that the largest coneentration is in the Rhine-Moselle sector, andthere are indications that this area may be further reinforced in the near future.22. General Von, Reichenau, who commanded the German mechanisedformations in peace, is reported to have established his headquarters at Marburgon the 9th October, and to be assembling an army to the north-east of Coblenz.It is estimated that these mechanised formations had completed the refittingnecessitated by the Polish Campaign by the 7th October, and that, since then,they have been ready for action on the Western Front. It is doubtful, however,whether there has yet been any actual concentration of mechanised divisions west of the Rhine, although elements of one armoured division and one light divisionhave been reported in the area between Kaiserlautern and Karlsruhe and ofone light division north of Dusseldorf.23. In forward areas the bulk of German rail movement has been betweenFreiburg and Basle, but no big increase in the forces on the southern half ofthe Rhine front has been established.24. Work is still in progress on German fortifications between Emmerichand the Saar. New fieldworks have been identified in the Eifel sector andinundations have been made, by means of barrages, in the valley forming the outer edge of the fortified zone south-east of Pirmasens. An item of interest is a work, possibly an aerodrome with underground hangars, which has been located south of Aachen.Pontoon bridges have been built across the Rhine, south of Mainz, and ona tributary of the Rhine at a point south of Rheinau (south of Kehl).Engineer stores and pontoon equipment are reported by a reliable source tohave been brought up to the area Emmerich-Geldern-Kleve-Rees a&amp;d -magfofrindioato oporationo acroao the Dutch frontier. -
Soviet Russia.The Russian Army in Poland.25. The artillery expansion, on which the Soviet decided a year ago, has apparently not progressed very far, for Russian formations in Northern Poland,presumably drawn from the important White Russian military district, are reported to have only 48 field guns and howitzers per division and 12 mediumguns and howitzers per corps.It has been suggested, however, that the Soviet did not move completeformations into Poland, but employed picked units from a number of formations.This theory is indirectly confirmed by the variety of regiments identified,though there is reason to suspect that some renumbering of units has been carriedout in order to confuse foreign observers.Reports criticising adversely the efficiency of Red Army units in Poland arestill being received.Soviet relations with the Baltic States.26. The Estonian Government has accepted most of the detailed demands made by the Soviet military mission.In addition to the published agreement, the Soviet may obtain an air base at Klooga Lake (near Baltiski) and possibly another at Virtsu. It is also reported that Soviet troops are to be stationed at Haapsaltj, apparently as a mobile reserve to oppose possible landing operations. The movement of soviet troops into Estonia was to have started on the 9th/10th October, but/appears-tehme been postponed.^       &amp;e* Z6*^ .Under the published terms of the Soviet-Latvian Pact, which was signed on the 6th October, the Soviet Union has obtained rights to establish naval bases at Libau and Windau, to build aerodromes for the Red Air Force on Latvianterritory and to station coastal artillery between Windau anc^jBiTRAGS (at theN.W. corner of the Gulf of Riga). &apos; 7According to the Latvian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Govern-ment adopted a reasonable attitude during the negotiations. Troops will numberfrom 25,000 to 35,000, and details of the location of aerodromes and defences areto be worked out by military missions.By her treaties with Estonia and Latvia the Soviet has obtained effective control of the coast from Lithuania to Leningrad, including a dominating position at the entrance to the Gulf of Riga. Her strategic position in the Baltic is,therefore, very greatly improved.It is difficult to forecast the future of these States, but it is most unlikely thatthe Soviet can afford to allow them to maintain their cultural and economic entitiesowing to the effect which contact with normal conditions might have uponRed Army troops.27. According to Press reports, the Soviet-Lithuanian negotiations have resulted in the cession of Vilna to Lithuania in exchange for the right to establishSoviet garrisons and air bases in the country and the free use of the Vilna-Libaurailway. There is no confirmation of reports that the Soviet Government hasdemanded the construction of fortifications on the Lithuanian-German frontier.28. The Soviet has adopted a somewhat threatening attitude to Finland inconnection with the forthcoming talks. This has led the latter to mobilise some50,000 to 60,000 men, and to deploy forces along her more vulnerable frontiers.The scope of the Soviet demands is not yet known. But, if they are excessive, itis quite probable that the Finns will resist.It is reported that the Soviet has a total of four divisions on or near theFinnish frontier. It is assumed that this total does not include the normalgarrison of the Leningrad area, and in any case these forces could be reinforcedquickly if necessary.Sweden is naturally apprehensive of Soviet action against Finland and theAaland Islands, and appears also to fear a Soviet attempt to seize the northern -Norwegian ports. The Swedish Army normally discharges all its conscriptpersonnel in the autumn, but these men are being retained with the colours inview of the general situation. The Government is taking measures to improve the training and armament of the forces, but is unlikely to produce effective resultsfor several months. It is, therefore, doubtful whether Sweden will be preparedto give Finland active support if the latter resists Russian demands.
Soviet activities elsewhere.29. There have been no further signs of concentrations on the Roumanianfrontier, where Soviet forces are estimated at . between twelve and fifteendivisions. The bulk of the Roumanian Army has been moved into EasternRou manic.Soviet military activity in the Caucasus appears to be continuing. Onereport stated that there were at least eighteen divisions in this area, but this isthought to be an exaggeration.The Balkans.Yugoslavia.30. Four defensive lines are being constructed in the area enclosed by therivers Danube and Tisa and the Hungarian frontier. They are designed tomake an attack by motorized formations across the Hungarian frontier asdifficult as possible till the wet weather begins about mid November.Little information is available regarding the state of the field defences onthe German frontier, but they are believed to consist of two lines; one justsouth of the frontier, and the other about twenty miles from the frontier.Bulgaria.31. The tension between Turkey and Bulgaria appears to be diminishing.It is expected that the divisions at present concentrated near the Turkish frontier and maintained at a higher establishment than other Bulgarian formations will shortly be reduced in strength.Greece.32. It has been officially announced that, as a result of the Italo-Greekaccord, the Greek forces will be returned to their normal peace locations. the classes of reservists due for release are to be discharged, but it appears that thestrength of formations near the Albanian frontier will be maintained by trans-ferring from Southern Greece men whose period of training has not beencompleted.Italy.33. There has been no appreciable increase in military activity. It isofficially announced that two new infantry divisions have been formed, but it isnot yet known whether these are to be first-line divisions or merely trainingdivisions for reservists. Some expansion in Alpini units has been effected by increasing the number of battalions in each reaiment. There is, however, no confirmation of the reported formation of additional Alpini divisions.The total reinforcements to date in Western Libya are estimated at one corps of three divisions with some corps and army troops and possibly one additionalinfantry division. Reinforcements in Eastern Libya appear to be confined to onecorps headquarters and some additional artillery. There are indications thatsix battalions of native troops have been duplicated, thereby providing sufficientinfantry units to complete two native divisions. The attitude in Libya remainsdefensive.Reliefs of Italian Army personnel in Albania have continued. Arrivalshave again slightly exceeded departures, but no new units have been identified.Reports show that the coast and anti-aircraft defences of ports are now being&apos;systematically installed.The Italian press of the 30th September announced the formation of the fascist Albanian Militia, organised in four legion headquarters, with general headquarters at Tirana.Iran.34.   Iran has taken the following precautions :   Two/^divisions, totalling/   - 18,000 men in all, have been^gisvod to the Caucasus frontier; one division, 8,000-l^f^^-   strong, is on the Turkestan frontier.  In the oil-field area, strong police guards
are protecting the refinery, and troops are guarding Abadan island, the pipe-line and the Iraq frontier northward from Mohammerah.The two strong divisions stationed at Teheran have not been moved.Tar Bast.35. In Central China, Japanese forces, operating southwards towardsChangsha, have withdrawn. This withdrawal was probably occasioned by under-estimation of maintenance difficulties and over-confidence which resulted in minortactical reverses. The Japanese withdrawal has been orderly, but it appears thatthey have sustained considerable losses in men and material. The success has hada markedly favourable effect on Chinese morale.In South China, sporadic fighting continues near the border of the LeasedTerritory at Hong Kong and the Japanese have had to increase their troops asa result. There is ample evidence that these reinforcements are not directed against the Colony.36.   The situation at Tientsin has improved.At Shanghai the activities of the police of the &quot; puppet &quot; regime are causingdifficulties in the western district of the city, which is in the British defencesector.AIR SITUATION.Distribution of German Air Force.37. No major moves have come to light during the past week, and it appearsthat the German long-range bomber units are still at their normal aerodromes.Reports have been received of intensive work on aerodromes in north-west germany. The land in this area is liable to be wet in winter and it is probablethat the Germans are constructing runways on their aerodromes.Trench Air Force.38. During most of the week bad weather made air reconnaissances difficult.Some useful flights were made over the areas to the east of Luxemburg, and airphotographs have disclosed that the Germans are constructing defence works inthis sector.   Low clouds have reduced the losses from German fighter aircraft.Effectiveness of German Anti-Aircraft Fire.39. Pilots have reported that German anti-aircraft fire is extremelyaccurate. Nevertheless, very few aircraft have been destroyed by this means in western Germany. On the 8th September a French reconnaissance aircraft was brought down at a height of 16,000 ft., and on the 11th September a similartype of aircraft was destroyed by ground machine-gun fire. Four other aircraft were missing during September and may have been shot down from the ground.It is more probable, however, that they were lost by fighter action.It therefore appears that of the twenty-seven French aircraft lost during september as a result of enemy action, only two are known to have been destroyedby AA. fire, although the loss of four more may have been due to the same cause.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.40. With the exception of the employment of bomber aircraft against german naval forces referred to in paragraph 1 above, our bomber forces in thiscountry and with the advanced air striking force in France have undertaken no major operations during the current period.Royal Air Force Component of the Field Force.41. The movement to France of the operational and ancillary units of theRoyal Air Force Component is now complete except for the aircraft of one squadron.
Reconnaissances to report on road and rail movements in North-western germany have been made in daylight. One aircraft which reconnoitred thearea Munster-Osnabruck-Bremen brought back a useful general report andphotographs which revealed no abnormal activity; the pilot stated that heencountered heavy fire from anti-aircraft guns and from the coast defencesbetween Borkum and Juist.Co-operation with Naval forces.42. Coastal Command aircraft have carried out a total of 57 patrols andsearches and 44 escorts for convoys in Home Waters during the week. In additionto the sightings of enemy vessels referred to above, a large number of merchant ships have been reported. Aircraft have sighted submarines on only three occasions.German sea reconnaissance aircraft have encountered our air patrols on three occasions. On one of these three Hudson aircraft shot down a Germanflying boat 95 miles east of St. Andrews.  A Danish trawler picked up the crew.
