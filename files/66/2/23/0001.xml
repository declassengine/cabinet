mWEEKLY RESUME (NO. 5) OF THE NAVAL, MILITARY .AND AIR SITUATION (12 NOON 28TH SEPTEMBER TO12 NOON 5TH OCTOBER!. : &quot;NAVAL SITUATION.General.la Our Naval forces have been re-disposed to meetthe new situation consequent on the report of a raideroff the N.E.  Coast of South America.      Cruisers on foreignstations are being concentrated in strong groups in themore important areas,  the older 6&quot; cruisers relieving8&quot; cruisers so as to free the latter for this purpose.2. Submarine patrols in the North Sea are being maintained.3. Six armed merchant cruisers are now working up,and more are completing fitting out shortly.Mines.h* There are three more lays to complete the southernportion of the Polices tone-Cape Grinez deep minefield.This, will then complete the whole Dover barrage.China Fleet.5. Japan is still not pressing her demands against us.However, five of our gunboats have been withdrawn from the Yangtse and negotiations are proceeding in the hope offurther easing the situation in Tientsin..Accidents.6. H.M.S. Barbara had a fire lasting several hours butrepairs should, be completed, by the 9th October.H.M. Destroyer VANOC has had an accident with herpom-pom and one rating had. died of injuries and 3 others are in hospital at Liverpool.

4   $i. i *3Attacks on British Shipping.7. Buring the week under review 2 British ships have&quot;been lost viz:-30th September 8, Ss  Clement (5051 tons) Sunlc by-raider 70 S.E. of PernambucOo5th October.      S.S. Glen Parg (876 tons) by submarine E. of Orkneys.8. On 5th October S.S. Marwarri (8O63 tons) wasbeached in the Bristol Channel after an explosion inNOol0 hold - not yet known whether internal orexternal.9. Out of 37 Vessels sunk, apparently only threehave been destroyed in disregard of International Law.The three cases in point are the Athenia, Aviemore,and Hazelside.      The case of the Athenia was given somuch publicity that nothing.more need be added.      Inthe case of the S,S. Aviemore the track of the torpedowas seen a few seconds before the explosion.      Itcannot, however, be said that the crew were left in open boats, as a destroyer escorting a convoy was onlytwenty minutes away.      The case of the Hazelside is ratherdifficult.      Undoubtedly two warning shots were fired,but according to the Chief Engineer, shelling commencedextremely quickly and went on during the abandonment of the ship, and a torpedo was fired, into the ship whilethe crew wwre getting the small boat away.

Neutral Shipping.10.      The following neutrals have been lost by enemy action -Date.       Nation-       Name.      Sohnage.      Place.      Cause.ality.12.28th Sept.

S/MLand End.11. On Lth October, the Norwegian Hoegh Transporter,I+91L tons, was mined off Singapore.      The Master failed. to comply with British instructions for avoiding theminefield.      This is the first neutral to strike aBritish mine.12.. The submarine which sank the Finnish Walma on23rd September gave  her a certificate to say &quot;she hadto be destroyed on the ground of the destination ofthe freight.&quot;       The Master of the Norwegian Takataas,sunk off Bergen on 28th September, has stated that theCommander of the German submarine refused to look at the ship&apos;s papers and said he had orders to sink all ships with cargo for Great Britain.13. Among the neutral ships taken into a GermanContraband station is the Swedish Korsholm 2,6h7 tonswith Finnish wood pulp and paper for Wilmington,Delaware U.S.A.

Convoys.lh. The total number- orf ships convoyed up to 3rdOctober was 992.      No ships in convoy have yet been sunk by enemy action.In consequence of the sinking of S.S. Clementall sailings from Santos and. Rio d.e Janeiro have been suspended for the present.U boat operations.15. There has been a marked decline in U boatactivity.      This is attributed to various causes viz:-(a) the change-over of submarines at the endof the first month of the war;(b) the increased, efficacy of our defensive measures, which tend to make attacks,particularly on convoys, more hazardous;(c) the weather;    and(d) U-boats making passage to the coasts of the americas to operate there,16. In a broadcast on the 30th September the Germansstated that they intended, in future to regard, every Britishmerchantman as a warship.      They stated that several german submarines had been attacked by British merchant shipsrecently, and that,  therefore, although German submarineshad hitherto conformed, to International La?/ in future theymust retaliate.17. Reports indicate that German submarines are continuing to attack neutral ships in the Skaggerak andthe vicinity.      The German contraband control service inthe Kattegat and Skaggerak is still being maitained by destroyers, aircraft   and submarines.18. There is a report of two large submarines offLisbon, which,  if true, confirms the belief of german submarines operating further afield.

19* Submarine bases are suspected, in the CanaryIslands and. it is estimated that seven or eight largesubmarines may now be in the Atlantic,      It seems clearthat many submarines   are coming out, both from the GermanBight and. from Kattegat,      Those operating in the north sea and Skaggerak are likely to be of the smaller type.20, The submarine which sank the Greek S.S. Diamantislanded 28 of the crew of that ship in Dingle Bayon S.W. SOast of Ireland on hth October.Anti-Submarine operations.21, Very few contacts have been made and only ninehunts have been carried out, with indecisive results.Twenty-two A/S Trawlers are now in commissionand. a- further 31 should be commissioned during the nextseven days,        In addition to these,  one A/S Yacht is in   -commission and six more should, be ready within a week.These latter are at present being fitted with depth charges only.      It is intended to fit guns and asdics,later.JErjrman Fleet.22. No further reliable information of German mainunits has been obtained, during the last week.      With theexception of the raider reported to have siuak theBritish S.S.  Clement, no main units appear to be at sea.The raider is. reported by survivors to be the Germanpocket battleship &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;.      For two reasons,however,  the identification is open to doubt.      In thefirst place there was a good report of the admiral scheer&apos;s presence in the Schilling Roads on 2U.th Septemberwhence she could not have reached. Pernambuco in six days.The raider-was also reported to have a tripod   mast andthe only known ships in the German-Uavy to&quot;be so fitted-5-

innI t iare the cruisers Hipper and BTucher.      It may be thatthe raider is one of these two ships disguised to looklike the Admiral Seheer with the object of drawing ourheavy ships from Home Waters,23, The Greek steamer Papelemos which left p/uenos Aireson the 13th September and is due  at St. Vincent, Gape VerdeIsland on the    8th October reports that she has on board the Captain and. Chief Engineer of S0S3  Clement,,      Vi/hen theClement was sunk on 30th September off Pernambuco,Papelemos must have been between Pernand Horanha and.St.  Pauls Rocks which indicates that the raider or attendantvessel proceeded, at any rate at first,  in the direction of cape Verde   Island,,2h. It is interesting to note that the admiral scheer having Diesel engines, has a radius of actionivhich would probably enable her to proceed from Germanyto South America and back without fuelling, whereas theHipper class, being turbine ships would presimiablyrequire to re-fuel on arrival at South America.Economic Warfarec25o No neutral ship has yet been seized in prize.The total tonnage of cargo so far seized in prize is289,L56o      In comparison only 139,250 tons in British shipsdestined for Great Britain had been lost by enemy actionup to the end of September.26,, In view of the action of the Soviet Government indeclining to allow British ships in Russian ports to clear for home until their cargoes had. been.paid for in american dollars or Swedish-kroner, it is intresting to note that the official Russian Export Agency hasapproached Finnish, Swedish and. Norwegian firms to supplyships to export Russian timber to Great Britain.      Itshould., however, be noted that the Germans have declared

41Qlibtimber to tie unconditional contraband and in two cases have sunk ships without more ad.o, merely for having had on board cargoes of contraband for Great Britain,German Merchant Shipping.27.        The HacU?ids considerable engineering activityis reported, on board this ship and in German workshopsashore at Las Palmas.      The Ascuncion at Las Palmasis. reported to be likely to sail shortly, as well asthe Madrid,     The Monte Pascoal and Prosyder were reported 2h0 miles east of the Amazon on the 28thSeptember and it is thought that the Scharnhorst maytry to reach Vladivostok from Kobe.      The North GermanLloyd steamer Columbus, a potential raider, has beenlying at Vera Cruz (Mexico) since September 9th and isnow reported to have left that port for Anton Lizard.owith the Mexican neutrality guard.s on board..      There are various reports from different parts of the world,of pending sales of German merchantmen, but exchange difficulties seem to be holding up negotiations.28c A report from CallaOyPeruj,states that the german ships  Ixalco-tis^ Hermonthis^ Leipzig and Munchen were dueto sail from Callao on the night of the 3rd or night ofhth October,      They were to be met by 3 submarines andsubsequently by Deutchland or Graf Spee which would, armthem.      The last report received of whereabouts ofDuetchland was on 22nd September and. of Graf Spee on2hth September when both were reported in theWilhelmshaven area.MISCELLANESOUS INTELLIGENCE.29. The Naval Attache, Holland,  stated that Dutchsecond mate of a ship who left Hamburg on the 28th September &apos;overland reported that three German ships of the Hamburg

American line between h and 1 thousand tons ballastedwith sand would leave Hamburg within U.8 hours accompaniedby 6 U-boats.      The object of the merchant ships wouldbe to act as decoys,  enabling the submarines to attachexamining vessels,30. The British Consul at Las Palmas reports thatthe G-erman aeroplane Nordwind has returned and beenhoisted on board the Ostmark.      In other words,  theycontinue to operate in neutral. waters.,31. There have been further reports of Masters ofships being made to sign a form by German submarines,saying that they will not go to sea again duringhostilities,

MILITARY SITUATION.WESTERN THEATRE.British Expeditionary Force.32.        The 1st Corps and G. H. Q.  Troops are now taking overthe sector allotted to the British Expeditionary Sbrce.The movement of the 2nd Corps to its Assembly area will be completed by the beginning of next week, after which it will proceed to take over a portion of theBritish sector.Operations.33.        The French have had some minor successes in the saar area and   ave repulsed all German efforts to dislodgethem.German operations have been confined to minorreconnaissances and some artillery fire in the sectorbounded by the Moselle and Rhine.      There have been nooperations on the Rhine Front,  i.e.  south of Karlsruhe.German Troop Movements.34.       A week ago 43 German divisions were reported on theWestern Front.      There are now at least 52 divisions,  inaddition to which elements of several other divisions havebeen reported.      To what extent the increase is due to thetransfer of divisions from Poland or from Central germany is not known.      The main flow of reinforcements has beentowards the sector between the Moselle and Rhine.      certain increases in the number of troops on the Dutch-Belgianfrontiers and on the southern half of the Rhine frontierhave also been reported.

-re has been no big concentration of Germanmechanized units in the frontier regions and it is believedthat the majority of the mechanized divisions are refittingin Germany.      They could, however, be quickly moved to anysector * where an offensive was contemplated.terman, For 11 f,1 cat ions j35.       New defensive works have been reported in thefollowing areas  ;(i)    Opposito the Southern Belgian and LuxembourgFrontier.(ii)    Between St. Wendel and Tholey (Saar).(iii)    On the Rhine front opposite Gerstheim.(iv)    In the area Mulheim - Istein,Barrages, possibly for inundation purposes, are being built in the area west of Pirmasens,Switzerland.36.        The Swiss have reinforced their covering troopsopposite the German frontier in the Basle region.Spain.37 a        The 1937 Class,  consisting of some 50,000 men, wasordered to be discharged on 23rd September.      Four classesremain with the Spanish Army.Numerous troop movements noted  on the Franco-Spanish frontier may be caused by reliefs, urgent defenceworks,  reorganisation of the Army or a reinforcement of thefrontier covering troops,      Activity has been shown in theconstruction of frontier defence works,Inuring September a net  increase of about 5,000 menin the garrison of Spanish Morocco was reported, principallynear the Franco--Spanish Moroccan frontier and the TangierInternational Zone,

. 4 OOI 0 i&apos;jEASTERN THEATRE,Poland.38.     &quot;Organised Polish resistance came to an end with thefall of Warsaw on-the 27th September, Modlin on the 28thSeptember and the Hei Peninsula on the 1st October.Guerilla fighting is probably still going on in outlyingdistricts.The Russian Advance in Poland.39o        By 28th September the Red Army had reached thegeneral line; Grajewo (45 miles N.W.  of Biailystok) -Miedzyrzec (40 miles West of Brest-Litovsk) -Szczebrzeszyn (40 miles S.S.E.  of Lublin) - Przemysl.Since that date no official communiques have been issuedregarding the line reached by the Red ArmycThe rate of advance during the period 23rd september to 28th September was between 6 and 10 miles per day.This was considerably slower than the initial rate and.affords indirect confirmation of a report that a veryserious breakdown had occurred in the petrol supply of theArmy.The equipment of the first line divisions of the red army is said to be good, but that of the reserve divisionspitiable.      The cavalry and infantry are described as anundisciplined rabble, but the appearance of the armouredtroops is satisfactory.      In northern Poland the soldiersappear to be greatly impressed with the standard   of living of the people.

I O cJgjoyj^et^ermaii. Agreement.40.       The Polish territory allotted to Germanyunder theagreement with the Soviet includes Danzig, West Prussia,Posen and Polish Silesia, all of which have been incorporate-ated in the Reich..By accepting the new political frontier the Soviethas given up a frontier of a certain strategical strength in favovir of one with few military advantages.      On theother hand,  since the new frontier approximates closely tothe &quot;Curzon Line&quot;,  she has put herself in a much stronger position politically and has got rid of a large and hostilePolish population.According to the terms of the Treaty she undertakes to provide Germany with further raw materials, to he paid for hy Germany in manufactured goods over a long period.This contrasts with the previous agreement, according &quot;towhich Russia was to obtain from Germany up to seven years&apos;credit for the purchase of German manufactures.      The newtrade agreement is,  on the surface, highly beneficial fromthe German point of view.      It is however doubtful whetherSoviet industry, already in a most unsatisfactory state,can wait years for its new plant without further serious loss of efficiency, which would inevitably cause a shrinkageof the volume of industrial raw materials available forexport to Germany.Russian Mobilisation.41,,        It has now been announced in Moscow that mobilisationi s proceeding smoothly throughout the whole of the SovietUniont    whereas former statements indicated that mobilisationwas only taking place in western European Russia.

-te.   ^It is difficult to assess the reasons for this measures, asthe Soviet has already mobilised as many formations as she could efficiently employ without undertaking majorhostilities in the V/est, and further mobilisation mustreduce output which is already hardly sufficient to meetthe elementary needs of the population.Hungary,,420        Unconfirmed reports indicate a considerable degreeof demobilisation to be in progress.RUSSIA AITD THE BALTIC STATES.Estonia.43.        ^here was considerable tension prior to theconclusion of the new Soviet-Estonian treaty on the 29thSeptember.      The Estonian territorial army was placed at12 hours notice, but the Government decided not to mobiliseunless Soviet  broops actually crossed the frontier.Under the ^terms of the treaty the Soviet may main-tain air and naval bases at Baltiski (Baltic Port) and onthe islands of Dago and Oesel.      A Secret report statesthat the Soviet Is to be allowed to maintain a total of25,000 men at these places.      A Soviet Military Missionunder the commander of the Leningrad District has arrived in Estonia to work out the military details.It is now reported that the Soviet Government made further demands on the 4th October for the establishment ofan aerodrome at Vurtsu (opposite the island of Oesel) andgarrisons at Rohukalu and Haapsalu (opposite the island ofDago).      she also demanded the transportation of troops forthese garrisons by train across Estonia to avoid danger of submarine attack.      It is reported that Estonia is notprepared to accept these demands.

Latvia.44.        Russian concentrations on the Latvian frontier havebeen maintained, in spite of the conclusion of the Soviet-Estonian treaty.      The Latvian Government thereforeanticipate that they will be faced with demands of the type made to Estonia.      The demands are foreshadowed as including the use of the p-?rts of Libau and Windau asSoviet naval bases and extra-territorial rights on therailways,,Finland.45.        The Estonian-Russian agreement caused the immediatereinforcement of Finnish Coast defences.      It is possiblethat Finland may anticipate Russian demands by the offer of the islands of Hodland and the Laransari group in returnfor economic concessions.Norway.46.        Additional Norwegian troops ana supplies are saidto have been sent to Sydvaranger in the extreme north east of the country.      This is presumably the result of reportedRussian troop movements to Murmansk.THE BALKANS.Roumania47,       As a result of agreement between the Roumanian andHungarian Ge eral Staffs,  some Roumanian troops are believed to have been withdrawn from the Hungarianfrontier, but details are lacking.      Otherwise there appears to be no important change in the situation.

. Soviet military activity on the Besserabian frontiercontinues and fortifications are &quot;being strengthened.    Themain Russian concentration, variously estimated at fromfive to nine divisions, is in the centre, hut there are indications of another concentration further east.BULGARIA.48.        The estimates of the present strength of the bulgarian Army (total 12 infantry divs, and 2 mobile divs.)are confirmed by a reliable source.    four active infantry divisions,  one active mobile division and two reserveinfantry divisions are located near the Turkish frontier,where it appears that work on fortifications and communications is being carried out..:0\;&apos;;.;-:\    :   &quot;&apos;;t&apos; O/,/  O &apos; OO vGREECE,49,        Though details regarding the relaxation of defensive,measures on the Albanian frontier have not been disclosed,,it is believed that an eventual withdrawal and reductionof garrisons are contemplated, but that these measures willbe carried out slowly,.    In the winter the mountainouscountry becomes almost impassable,TURKEY.50,        Work on the    tos-tificatIons near the Thracianfrontier is being actively pursued and it seems that the defensive system on this frontier is to be more extensivethan was at first con templated.    It is believed that anew formation is being raised at Istanbul and that it may ultimately be expanded to the strength of a corps.    It isofficially stated that there are still only seven infantry divisions,  one cavalry division and an armoured brigadein Thrace.

It is too early to estimate the effect of the russo--German pact on Turkish military dispositions, hutuntil the Erzurum-Erzincan stretch of railway has beencompleted in a few weeks1  time, it seems unlikely thatthere will be any change in the normal garrison of eastern Anatolia.YUGOSLAVIA.51o        The situation in Yugoslavia is unaltered.There are indications that the rapid success of armoured units and aircraft in Poland has caused the YugoslavGeneral Staff to modify their plan to hold a long line offrontier.MIDDLE EAST.Reinforcements from India for Egypt.52.        One divisional headquarters and an infantry brigade group, being the remainder of India&apos;s External defence troops, arrived at Suez on the 3rd and 4th October.&apos;&quot;Turco-Soviet and Iranian-Soviet frontiers.53.        There are indications that Soviet forces on &quot;theTurkish and Iranian frontiers have been reinforced byarmoured troops and aircraft.,    A report that three Russiancavalry divisions have also arrived in this area isunconfirmed.Sinkiang.54.        Thez^e is no confirmation of the press reports of &apos;the movement of 300,000 troops into Sinkiang.    It isconsidered that the figure must be a gross exaggeration,though it is possible that some Soviet troops have been

1 goloomoved into the Province either to extend the zone underSoviet control southwards with a view to making futurediversions on the Indian frontier, or to reinforce the.Chinese communist armies in N.W.  China0ITALY.General.55.        There has been some transfer of troops from theGerman and Yugoslav frontiers towards the French frontier,but it is still uncertain if these moves represent reliefsor reinforcements.No further classes appear to have been called up infull and some reservists are being&apos;granted leave forseasonal agricultural work or are being replaced by othersnewly called up.Previous reports to the effect that certain infantryformations despatched overseas were being replaced in their peace garrisons by newly raised formations are not yetconfirmed.    The decision announced by Signor Mussolini to incorporate 172 black shirt Militia battalions in the ranks of the Army is of political rather than military interest.Some desertions across the Yugoslav frontier continue.In general, military activity remains somewhat relaxed.Albania.56.        There is still no confirmation of the reportedwithdrawal of one or perhaps two divisions from Albania,but there are indications, that one division may be withdrawn in the near future.    Reliefs of army reservist-personnel have continued.    Arrivals have slightly exceededdepartures.    There are further indications that units havereverted to-their normal peace stations from areas near the Greek frontier.

57.        There has &quot;been no- reinforcement^ of^XJA^ya^-d3Jring^the-past week, but small quantities of material continue toarrive.    There are indications that the Italians may beproceeding with the formation of the native army corps of two divisions, which is expected to be organised from thenative units existing in the colony.Dodecanese.S8..       The total strength of regular army personnel hasbeen reduced by 10 to 15 per cent.FAR EAST.Military Operations.59.        The Japanese are pEessing their southward advanceagainst Ghangsha, the capital of Hunan.    operations have been delayed somewhat by rain, whilst Chinese resistance has beenstronger than for some months past.    The Japanese claim to be within twenty miles of their objective.Sporadic fighting has occurred in the vicinity of the border of the Leased Territory at Hong Kong where Chineseguerillas, probably aided by regular troops, have attackedJapanese posts.    It seems unlikely, however, that the Chinesewill achieve any important results.Japanese reinforcements to Manchuria60..       In Manchuria the Japanese are still taking precautions against Soviet Russia.    The daily landing of troops, horsesand stores at Dairen has continued during the past week..Situation in Tientsin.61..       Japanese losses of war material due to floods are estimated at  6,000,000.    The flood waters have suddenlyreceded from the city leaving the British Concession dry on28th September.

AIR SITUATION.Distribution of German. Air Force.62.       No large scale moves of the German Air Force havebeen noted during the past week.     There are indications,however, that units sent during September to reinforceEast Prussia are being withdrawn.      Reports which havebeen current of large concentrations of bombing aircraft in the Aachen area have not been confirmed.      In viewof the lack of suitable aerodromes in this district thereports are unlikely to be true, and it is probable thatthey refer to units of Army Co-operation and fighter aircraft which have been moved up from their peace timestations east of the Rhine.Possible ob jectives of German Air Force.63.      -A number of reports have been received. ind.iC8.tingthat the German plan in the event 03? attack on GreatBritain is to concentrate against her ports and shipping.It is impossible to say whether these reports have beenput about deliberately, but they are in line with views which have been expressed, by Field. Marshal Goering.jfest-grn Front.6br.        German fighter aircraft&quot; have been active on theFrench Front during the last week, particularly in the saar sector.      Several reconnaissances over french territory have been carried out both by day and. by night,  on one occasion over Montmedy.Reinforcements of fighter aircraft are statedto have arrived on the Saar front recently and A.A.  gunsand searchlights to have been put in position in theMosel valley and on the Uosel-Rhine front.

Air Operations on the Western Front by the French AirForce.65. The French Air Force has continued to undertakereconnaissances of road and rail movement in western germany.     Owing to difficult weather and heavy enemyopposition it has been impossible to obtain a completepicture of the movements which have taken place duringthe past week, but there have been indications of movements in the general direction of the Ruhr duringthe period 23rd-50th September.Attacks against French reconnaissance aircraft by enemy fighters have continued, but the French fighters arenow taking a more active part and have shown theirsuperiority over the M.E. 109.     The French claim thaton the 30th September they shot down seven Germanfighters.Italy.66. There is no evidence of recent moves of units ofthe Italian Air Force, nor of preparations for war.Evidence continues to be received that Italy is anxiousto make use of her neutrality to improve her export trade,and in particular to supply armaments, including aircraftmaterial.Operations in Poland.67. From information obtained from eye-witnesses itappears that the effect of the heavy German high explosivebomb when dropped in soft ground, is very local.     the explosion expends itself vertically and bombs whichhave dropped within a few&quot;, yards of people have leftthem unshaken.

Royal Air Force Operations.Reconnaissances in North west and West Germany.68, Day and night reconnaissance flights have beenmade by Blenheim aircraft over north-west Germany, mainly to establish the density of traffic on roads and railways,and to examine German air dispositions.
