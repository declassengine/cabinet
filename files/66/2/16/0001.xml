THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GQYERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND  KEY. ^ JIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.Sjfi ORE T. COPY NO.    -74^^0^0,(39)  5. WAR___CABINET.STANDING INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON CENSORSHIP.MEMORANDUM ON THE INTERCEPTION AND EXAMINATIONOP MAILS ON NEUTRAL VESSELS.General.1* The following proposals are made as the result ofa conference at which the Attorney-General was present andthe Foreign Office, the Admiralty,  the Ministry of economic warfare and the War Office (Censorship Department)   were represented.      They have also been agreed to by all membersof the Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Censorship,except as stated in paragraph 7. below,It is laid down in the War Book that the policy tobe adopted with regard to the divex-sion of mails is to be thesubject of a Cabinet decision after the outbreak of war.Voluntary Diversion.2. So far as mails on ships which call voluntarily at british ports are concerned, we have always claimed theright to subject these to full censorship under MunicipalLaw.Involuntary Diversion.3. So far as mails on ships which are brought in ordiverted here are concerned, the position under internationallaw differs in respect of    inward mails,  i.e. mails which door may contain packets or letters for the enemy country,  andoutward mails, which may contain packets or letters from theenemy country.Legal a spec t s. of . inv o luntary diversion.4. under Hague Convention XL of 1907,  to which HisMajesty&apos;s Government were party, postal correspondence of-1

neutrals or belligerents, whether official or private in character, which may be found on board a neutral or enemyship at sea is inviolable.     If the ship is detained, the correspondence is to be forwarded by the captor with theleast possible delay,      It has been suggested that thisArticle constitutes an absolute prohibition on interferencewith, and the examination of   mail bags, whatever may bethe nature of their contents.     The other view is that the immunity is to be enjoyed only by postal correspondence,and the belligerent is, therefore, at liberty to examinethe mail bags, and if necessary their contents, in orderto see that they constitute genuine postal correspondenceand not articles of a noxious character, such as contraband.Action regarding involuntary diversion during 1914-18e5B In the last war none of the belligerents   acceptedthe first view, though they gave different grounds forrepudiating it.     The view taken in this country was thatthe general right to search for contraband entitled afull examination of mails.   . In fact, essential information from the point of view of the Contraband Committee and thePrize Court and the security services was obtained by this examination.      If, when the examination was completed, no grounds for condemnation were found, the postal packetswere released and sent on to their destination.     The moment at which they were sent on depended on the exigencies of thesituation,,      In the latter part of the last war very wide powers with regard to diverted mails were exercised underthe Reprisals Order-in-Council.Reasons for applying involuntary diversion during thepresent war.6. The experience gained in. 1914-18 justifies a renewal of the examination of diverted    mails during the present war for the following reasons :-

(a) The essential evidence by which evasions ofthe blockade were detected and by which&apos;&apos;contraband was identified was produced fromthis sourceo(b) This examination was one of the principalsources by which plots and agencies abroadwere detected,,(c) The material obtained from such examinationwas used as a spear-head for the attack on enemy finance and tradeoThe Contraband Committee attach the greatest importance to the evidence which might be obtained as aresult of this examination.S.9.ard ..j-2f ^rade^ j)J^e^.t ions 070 It is only fair to add that the representativeof the Board of Trade on the Committee has expressed concernat the probable effect of the examination of divertedmails on neutrals, and also to the proposal in paragraph 2.of the draft letter annexed to this memorandum, that mailsshould be forwarded after examination at the expense ofthe countries either .of origin or of destination.Method of applying examination of diverted mails.8c If it is decided that diverted mails should be subjected to examination $, this will bo carried out, at liverpool by the Censorship Staff, who havethe necessary linguistic and other qualifications forscrutinising the mails from all relevant points of view.This will, of course, involve delay, but every effort will be made to minimise it, especially in the case ofships which have come in voluntarily for examination.Scope of examination of diverted mails.9. As the ostensible object of the examination of mailsis the search for contraband, it can at present only be

applied to mails bound to Europe.     For the present/therefore, it is not proposed to examine mails outward bound from Europe, except in the case of ships, whichcall at a British port in the ordinary course of trade.It may be possible in future to extend the policy of examining outward mails, either because the examinationof mails on ships which call in the ordinary course oftrade shows a considerable transport of obnoxiousdocuments or in consequence of the adoption of apolicy of stopping German exports on grounds of reprisalor otherwise.Mails on ships outward bound from Europe wouldnot be examined except in the case of ships which callat the above ports in the ordinary course of trade.Action to co-ordinate procedure and toinform Foreign Governments.10. Should the recommendation in paragraph 11 &quot;below be approved, the Dominions Office, India Office and BurmaOffice will be informed in order that His Majesty&apos;governments in the Dominions and the Governments ofIndia and Burma may be consulted with a view to theiradopting a corresponding procedure;    the Colonial office will also be informed in order that the colonial governments may be requested to take similar&quot; action.The War Book contemplated that if a decision were taken in the above sense, a communication would besent to representatives of Foreign Governments in london as a formal notification to their Governments.     Adraft for this purpose is annexed.

&apos;   Question for decision.118 The Standing Inter-departmental Committee onCensorship therefore recommend that mails on neutral ships inward hound to Europe and diverted to Ports inthe United Kingdom or Northern Ireland should he submitted to a full and thorough examination (although noReprisals Order-in-Council has been issued), but thatmails on neutral ships outward bound from Europe shouldnot be examined except in the case of those ships whichcall at the above ports in the ordinary course of trade.(Signed)    F.G. BEAUMONT-NESBITTChairmanOn behalf of the Committee.Richmond ^errace, S.W.I.30th September, 1939&quot;

ANNEX.Draft of proposed communication to Foreign Governments.,His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State forForeign Affairs presents his compliments to the      0.00.000.Representative, and has the honour to inform him that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom find itnecessary, owing to the state of war existing between thiscountry and  ................ , to examine certain seabornemails on ships calling at, or diverted to, British ports inorder to ascertain that they do not contain articles of contraband or obnoxious documentSo2. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom desireto conduct this operation with as little inconvenience aspossible to foreign nations.      If it proves impracticable tosend the mails on by the same vessel, they will be conveyedafter examination, to the port from which they can be most conveniently re-shipped, and there held at the disposal ofthe countries of origin or destination, to be sent on at theexpense of such countries to the places to which the mailsare addressed.,3. His Majesty1 s Government are prepared, as an act ofgrace, to grant exemption from examination to(a) Letters and postal packets which areaddressed to, or bear an externalindication that they emanate from,a State Department, Embassy orLegation of any Power not at war withHis Majesty.(b) Official diplomatic and consular bags.FOREIGN OFFICE,000000*9460     19c      o oThe ........... ...00.00.0   Representative.richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,30th September, 1939.
