As 1 stated on Thursday last,  the responsihilityof the Ministry of Information for nev/s has not extended in any way beyond the provisions of means-jtar^its communications to&apos; the press,    A review has nowbeen made of the arrangements for the distributionof news,  including the question of direct contact between the Press and the Departments,,    The subjecthas been fully discussed with the representatives ofthe Press with a view to meeting their conveniencein the matter.As a result it has been, decided that there shallbe a reversion to the practice existing prior to theoutbreak of war, whereby the press representatives had direct contact with the various GovernmentDepartments ^^h&amp;a-^lJ^pW^txo^tB^^nap^-vea furnishingthe Pres6h,w&quot;ith all official communications in such,/&apos;manne&apos;RPAs was found /most appropriate *   Each      /Department will therefore now make its own arrange-ments for communicating^hews to the Press// / /representatives. \The/Press Sections of ,the various/ / /Departments, at present housed in the.Ministry ofInformation, wihl return to their respectiveHe a^oua rt-ers ^p)It has, however, been represented to theMinister that the mechancial facilities provided inthe building occupied by.the Ministry for the receiptand. distribution of Government communications have proved of great convenience to a large section ofthe Press..,    There is no present intention to do away with these facilities/Nrhich will remain availablefor use by individual Departmentsito the extent towhich these Departments,  (after consultation with thepress representatives with whom they deal) ma;/ find it generally convenient to utilise them.

I should add that some difficulty must be expected in connection with the supply and distribution of news In ttime of war:    the revised arrangements now proposed are intended to reduce difficulties to a minimum and I feel sure that I can rely upon the Press to co-operate in them?smooth workingsThe new arrangements will come into force onWednesday morning next.As regards censorship, the responsibility forcensorship must rest, like the responsibility for news andits distribution, upon the Departments which are concernedwith the subject matter      Departments will, of course,exercise their ov/n censorship as regards the news that they give out     The censorship of anything based upon the newswill, as before, be operated by Censor Officers guided bythe directions of the DepartmentseIn the event of questions arising as to any particularcensorship operation, the Minister in charge of theDepartment affected will answer for it in Parliament0It is proposed to modify the present arrangement forthe central operation of Censorship by the appointment ofSir Ronald Lindsay as Director of Censorship0The Censorship which, as the House will realise? isconcerned only with material or messages voluntarily submittedby the Press, is at present housed in the building occupiedby the Minister of Information and it is not proposed tomake any change in its location^     If experience shows thatthe revised scheme for the issue of news is practicable and meets the needs of the situation I shall be glad to arrangefor consideration to be given to the location of the censorship staff, if there should be a need for any change^
