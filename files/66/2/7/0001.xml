THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  Septerhffer 1939.MOST SECRET.Oodv No. O, /fW.P. (39) 57.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that speciai care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.NORWAY AND SWEDEN.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.Chartering Norwegian Tonnage.THE Norwegian Delegation is approaching, and in a few days the Presidentof the Board of Trade hopes to make a bargain with them by which he chartersall their spare tonnage, the bulk of which consists of tankers. As Norwegianseamen are shy of sailing under war conditions, it may be that we shall have toman the ships on what is called a &quot;bare-boat charter.&quot; This prospect, ifunavoidable, should not deter us. The Admiralty consider the chartering of this tonnage most important, and Lord Chatfield has written strongly urging itupon them.German Supplies of Iron Ore from Narvik.2. At the end of November the Gulf of Bothnia normally freezes, so thatSwedish iron ore can only be sent to Germany through Oxelosund in the Baltic, orfrom Narvik at the north of Norway. Oxelosund can only export about one-fifth of the weight of ore Germany requires from Sweden. In winter normally themain trade is from Narvik, whence ships can pass down the west coast of Norway,and make the whole voyage to Germany without leaving territorial waters untilinside the Skagerack.It must be understood that an adequate supply of Swedish iron ore is vital toGermany, and the interception or prevention of these Narvik supplies during thewinter months, i.e., from October to the end of April, will greatly reduce her powerof resistance. For the first three weeks of the war no iron ore ships left Narvikowing to the reluctance of crews to sail and other causes outside our control.Should this satisfactory state of affairs continue, no speciai action would be demanded from the Admiralty. Furthermore, negotiations are proceeding withthe Swedish Government which in themselves may effectively reduce the suppliesof Scandinavian ore to Germany.Should, however, the supplies from Narvik to Germany start moving once more, more drastic action will be needed.Relations with Sweden.3. Our relations with Sweden require careful consideration. Germany actsupon Sweden by threats Our sea-power gives us also powerful weapons, which,if need be, -we must use to ration Sweden. Nevertheless, it should be proposed,as part of the policy outlined in paragraph 2, to assist the Swedes so far aspossible to dispose of their ore in exchange for our coal; and, should this notsuffice, to indemnify them, partly, at least, by other means.  This is the next step.[20056]
Chapter and Insurance of all available Neutral Tonnage.4. The above considerations lead to a wider proposal. Ought we not tosecure the control, by charter or otherwise, of all the free neutral shipping we can obtain, as well as the Norwegian, and thus give the Allies power to regulate thegreater part of the sea transport of the world and recharter it, profitably, to thosewho act as we wish ?And ought we not to extend to neutral shipping not under our direct control the benefit of our convoy system ?The results so far achieved by the Royal Navy against the U-boat attackseem, in the opinion of the Admiralty, to justify the adoption of this latter course. This would mean that we should offer safe convoy to all vessels of allcountries traversing our sea routes, provided they conform to our rules of contraband, and pay the necessary insurance premiums in foreign devisen. Theywould therefore be able to contract themselves out of the war-risk, and withthe success of our Anti-U-boat Campaign we may well hope to make a profitto offset its heavy expense. Thus not only vessels owned by us or controlled byus, but independent neutral ships would all come to enjoy the British protectionon the high seas, or be indemnified in case of accidents. It is not believed atthe Admiralty that this is beyond our strength. Had some such scheme for the chartering and insurance of neutral shipping been in force from the early days of the last war, there is little doubt that it would have proved a highlyprofitable speculation. In this war it might well prove to be the foundation of a League of Free Maritime Nations to which it was profitable to belong.5. It is therefore asked that the Cabinet, if they approve in principle ofthese four main objectives, should remit the question to the various Departmentsconcerned in order that detailed plans may be made for prompt action.Ill w. s. c.Admiralty, September 29, 1939.
