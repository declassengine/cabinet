For this reason the service has at present been entirely suspended by this country;but it is s till continued by the French authorities toa limited extentD     It is understood that certaincensored Press calls are allowed and, in urgent cases,

calls to or from the Balkan Legations.      In France,a full Military &quot;Control&quot; has been established and allthese calls are also listened to, as described inparagraph 3.5. During the last war no such cable telephonefacilities existed and there is, therefore, no precedent for -guidance;Demand for Service.6.-        The Ministry of Information is pressing for facilities for rapid telephonic communication of newsto the Balkan countries, particularly as German news,is speedily disseminated whereas British news is liableto delay.      The communication would be restricted tothe transmission by Press correspondents of censoredmessages from the Ministry itself.7. Both the Balkan Legations in this country andtheir Governments have been endeavouring to obtain permission to. make calls.Military,  Censorship Positions8. The Controller of Postal and telegraph censorship regards this telephone service via germany as likely to prove a serious source of leakage ofinformation unless the most rigid safeguards as to the.persons permitted to telephone,and the matter to betelephoned, are Imposed.      He urges that only Presscalls for the purpose of dictating a previously consoredscript should be permitted and that in no circumstances should conversations be allowed.      The Foreign Officeconcurs in the suggested prohibition of conversations on the ground that with certain Balkan states, therewould be a possibility of leakage of information ifdiplomatic calls were permitted.

9 O&apos;Alternative methods of cbimmunlcat!ono90 The Committee feel that, so far as Foreign Missionsare concerned, the subject matter of a conversation could,in the majority of cases, equally well be transmitted by telegram in cypher^     Also the Missions concerned are at liberty to telephone from their   Embassies and Legations inLondon to the Heads of their own Missions in the fourneutral countries mentioned in paragraph 1 above, whencethe information can be conveyed to Balkan countries.RECOMMENDATIONS.Telephone Censorship Control.10o The Standing Inter-Departmental Committee onCensorship submit for approval the following recommendations for the extension of existing facilities and the consequentialinstitution   of telephone censorship control:-(i) . That the Controller of Postal and telegraph censorship should be empowered to authorizethe use of cable and radiotelephone services by business firms and individuals where sucha course seems appropriate(ii)    That all users should be warned that callsare subject to censorship.,(iii)    That the power conferred in   (i)    above shouldbe exercised with careful discretion, whilebearing in mind the need to provide as fully as possible for the requirements of theexport trade?and that the control should be particularly strict on the radiotelephone services.(iv)    That calls as i:a (i) above should be only in english and French0(v)    That an overseas telephone censorship control should be authorised in this country, staffedby officers under the Controller of Postal and telegraph Censorship.,(vi)    That the telephone censorship control shouldhave power to listen to all overseas callsother than Government and Diplomatic and press calls and to disconnect any callsimmediately should undesirable conversationtake place.Telephone Service to the Bal^kans.11. The Committee, with the concurrence of the Ministry-4-

?of Information, also desire to submit the following recommendations for telephone services to the Balkans:-(i)    That telephone communication between theUnited Kingdom and the Balkan countries by-way of Germany should be permitted on condition that it is strictly limited toconsored Press calls by duly accredited Pressrepresentatives and by the Press attaches ofthe Poreign Legations concerned and that all such calls are made from the Ministry ofInformation, by dictating from a previouslycensored script:(ii)    That the number of authorized representatives should be limited and their names recordedwith the Gensorshop Authorities,(iii)    That no conversation of any kind, either bydiplomatic representatives or other persons,British or foreign,  should be permitted, except on service instructions, ar prearranged withthe Censor.(iv)    That the Poreign Office should inform thevarious diplomatic Missions concerned to this effect.(Signed)    P.
