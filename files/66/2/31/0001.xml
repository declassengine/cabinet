BRIDGES.Secretary,Richmond Terrace, S.W.1*10th October, 1939.

Last week in speaking of the announcement aboutthe Russo-German pact I observed that it contained asuggestion that some peace proposals were likely to beput forward and I said that if such proved to be the case -we should examine them in consultation with the Governmentsof the Dominions and of the French Republic in the lightof certain relevant considerations.Since then the German Chancellor has made his speech,but before I inform the House of the results of our examination of it, I must ask Hon, Members to recall fora few moments the background against which his proposalsappear0At the end of August H.M. Government were actively engaged in correspondence with the German Government onthe subject of Poland.      It was evident that the situation was dangerous but we believed that it should be possibleto arrive at a peaceful solution If passions were notdeliberately stimulated and we felt quite certain that theGerman Government could if they desired influence their friends in Danzig in such a way as to bring about a relaxation of tension and so create conditions favourable to calm and sober negotiation.      It will be remembered thatin the course of this correspondence the German Chancellorexpressed his wish for improved relations between our twocountries as soon as the Polish question was settled, towhich Ho M. Government replied that they fully shared the wish but that everything turned on the nature and methodof settlement with Polande     We pointed out that a forciblesolution would inevitably involve the fulfilment of our obligations to Poland and we begged the German Chancellor

to enter into direct discussions with the Polish GoverniKeH&amp; &quot;In which the latter Government had already expressed its willingness to take part.As everyone knows, these efforts on the part ofH. Mo Government to avoid war and the use of force werein vainc     In August last the President of the UnitedStates made an appeal to Herr Hitler to come to aconference in order to prevent war breaking out in Europe*At about the same time the King of the Belgians, the queen of the Netherlands, His Holiness the Pope, and sign or Mussolini all tendered their good offices, butequally in vain,,     It is evident now that Herr Hitler was determined to make war on Poland and whatever sinceritythere may have been in his wish to come to an understanding with Great Britain it was not strong enough to induce himto postpone an attack upon his neighbour.      On the1st September Herr Hitler violated, the Polish frontier and invaded Poland, beating down by force of arms and machinery the resistance of the Polish Nation and Army,As attested by mutual observers, Polish towns and villageswere bombed and shelled into ruins;    and civilians wereslaughtered wholesale, in contravention, at any rate inthe later stages, of all the undertakings of which herr hitler now speaks with pride as though he had fulfilled them.It is after this wanton act of aggression, which hascost so many Polish and German lives, sacrificed to satisfyhis own insistence on the use of force, that the german chancellor now puts forward his proposals.

If there existed any expectation that in theseproposals would be included some attempt to make amendsfor this grievous crime against humanity, following so soon upon the violation of the rights of the Cxechoslovaknation, it has been doomed to disappointment.      ThePolish state and its leaders are covered with abuse.What the fate of that part of Poland which Herr Hitlerdescribes as the German sphere of interest is to bedoes not clearly emerge from his speech, but it is evident that he regards it as a matter for the con-sideration of Germany alone, to be settled solely inaccordance with German interests.     The final shapingof this territory and the question of the restorationof a Polish state are, in Herr Hitler&apos;s view problems which cannot be settled by war in the west butexclusively by Russia on the one side and Germany onthe other.We must take it, then, that the proposals whichthe German Chancellor puts forward for the establishmentof what he calls &quot;the certainty of European security&quot;are to be based on recognition of his conquests andhis right to do what he pleases with the conquered.It would be impossible for Great Britain toaccept any such basis without forfeiting her honour and abandoning her claim that international disputesshould be settled by discussion and not by force.

---yfsfi passages in the speech designed to givefi?ea$z assurances to.. Herr Hitler9 s neighbours Ipass. overs since they will know what value should \\:ihe attached to them hy reference to the similarassurances he has given in the past.But it would he easy to quote sentencesfrom his speeches in 1935, 1936 .and 1938 statingin the most definite terms his determination notto annex Austria or conclude an Anschluss with her,not to fall upon Czechoslovakia and not to make anyfurther territorial claims in Europe after theSudetenland question had been settled in September1938.Nog can we pass over Herr Hitler8s radicaldeparture from the long professed principles ofhis policy and creed, as instanced by the inclusion,in the Reich of many millions of Poles and Czechsand the pact with the Soviet Union, concluded after

This repeated disregard of his word and thesesudden reversals of policy bring me to the fundamentaldifficulty in dealing, with- the wider proposals in theGerman Chancellor!s speech,        The plain truth is that,after- our past experience, it is no ,Longer possible to rely upon the unsupported word of the present GermanGovernment,,It is no part of our policy to exclude from herrightful place in Europe a Germany which will live inamity and confidence with other nations.    On thecontrary, we believe that no effective remedy can befound for the worlds ills that does not take accountof the just claims and needs of all countries,  andwhenever the time may come to draw the lines of anew peace settlement, His Ma:]estyrs Government would feel that the future would hold little hope unless such a settlement could be reached through the methodof negotiation and agreementsIt was not therefore with any vindictive purposethat they embarked on war.      Whatever may be the issueof the present struggle, and in whatever way it may bebrought to a conclusion,  the world will not be the sameworld that we have known before0      Deep changes will inevitably leave their mark on every field of men&apos;sthought and action,  and if humanity is to guide arightthe new forces that will be in operation all nations will have their part to play,,

C 3 dHi s Ma jesty&apos; s G-ov eminent know -all - too-- well that .in modern war between great Powers victor and vanquishedmust alike suffer cruel loss0     But surrender towrong-doing would spell the extinction of all hope, andthe annihilation of all those values of life which havethrough centuries been at once the mark and theinspiration of human progress.I am certain that all the peoples of Europe,including the people of Germany, long for peace, a peacev/hich will enable them to live their lives without fear,and to devote their energies and their gifts to thedevelopment of their culture, the pursuit of their idealsand the improvement of their material prosperity.     Thepeace which we are determined to secure, however, must bea real and settled peace, not an uneasy truce interrupted by constant alarms and repeated threats.     Vi/hat stands in. the way of such a peace?     It is the German Governmentand the German Government alone, for it is they who byrepeated acts of aggression have robbed all Europe oftranquillity and implanted in the hearts of all their neighbours an ever-present sense of insecurity and fear*-6-

I would therefore sura up the attitude of H. M0Government as followsHerr Hitler rejected all suggestions for peace until he had overwhelmed Poland, as he had previously overthrownCzechoslovakia,,     Peace conditions cannot he acceptablewhich begin by condoning aggression.The proposals in the German Chancellorfs speech arevague and uncertain, and contain no suggestion for rightingthe wrongs done to Czechoslovakia and to Poland^Even if Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals were more closelydefined and contained suggestions to right these wrongs,,it would still be necessary to ask by what practicalmeans the German Government intend to convince the world that aggression will cease and that pledges will be keptftPast experience has shown that no reliance can be placed upon the promises of the present German Government,Accordingly, acts - not words alone - must be forthcomingbefore the Allies would be justified in ceasing to wagewar to the utmost of their strength,,      Only when worldconfidence is restored will it be possible to find solutionsof those vital questions of disarmament and restoration oftrade which are essential to the well-being of the peoples^There is thus a primary condition to be satisfied.Only the German Government can fulfil it.      If they willnot, there can as yet be no new or better world order of thekind for which all nations yearn.The issue is therefore plain.      Either the German Govern-ment must giwe convincing proof of the sincerity of - their-......desire for peace by definite acts and by the provision of effective guarantees of their intention to fulfil their undertakings or we must persevere in our duty to the end^It is for Germany to make her^ choice.
