Our conclusions on-German sto-barracks, productivecapacity, sources of wartime supply and rate of consumptionare given in the paragraphs which follow.    The figures given are based on the information obtained from the petroleum Department, the Service Intelligence Departments3the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Economic Warfare,in collaboration with the Board of Trade.    All information in the possession of the Oil Companies has also beenmade available&apos; to us without reservation.    nevertheless we feel bound to emphasise that, owing to the number of &apos;unknown, factors involved, the results of our investigationmust-, to some extent, be based on reasonable assumption.Where we have given figures, we have been at pains toestimate the position in a light favourable to Germany.^The composition is given in theAppendix.

cf jl&apos;    GERMAN STOCKS OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS ON 1ST SEPTEMBER. 1959.5. Our estimate of commercial and Government stocksheld in Germany on 1st September, 1959 is as follows 1-Commercial Stocks if million tons.Government     !I 1 to a maximum of &apos;1-J million tons.Total Stocks Not likely to be more than5 million tons, includingstocks of aviation spiritheld at aerodromes.In arriving at the above figures, we gave due consideration to the figures of German tankage which, we estimate, do not exceed the following:-Coromercial Tankage 2-j? million tonsGovernment       &quot; li &quot;        &quot;Total 4 &quot;       &quot;4. There is Insufficient information available aboutGermany&apos;s consumption and replenishment to enable us toestimate the change in stocks since the outbreak ofwar.ESTIMATED ANNUAL RATE OF CONSUMPTION FROM 1ST SEPTEMBER, 19595. Our estimate of Germany&apos;s oil expenditure  (including that of Bohemia, Moravia and half of Poland) for the first six and the first twelve months from 1st September, 1959 isas follows:-1st 6 months. 1st 12 months.Navy 600,000 tons 1,200,000 tonsArmy 72^,000      &quot; 1,625,000    &quot;Air Force 700,000      &quot; 1,400,000    &quot;Industry,  etc .5,000,000      51 6,0.00,000    &quot;5,025,000 10,225,000    &quot;

(b) Imports.7- Russia and Poland.Soviet industrial expansion and increase of mebhanisa-tion, particularly in agriculture, has created a domestic demand for petroleum products which has greatly exceeded theincrease in production of petroleum in Russia, in spite ofevery endeavour to speed up production.Since 1954, although the output of crude petroleum hasincreased by nearly 6 million tons, exports have fallen by over 5 million tons.    Thus in 1953 the exports were wellbelow 1 million tons and by 1940 they were expected practically,to disappear.    It seems clear, therefore, that Russia couldnot export any material quantity of petroleum to Germany except at the expense of her own industry or agriculture;    and we are advised that It is most improbable that Russia would beprepared to harm her economic development In any way for Germany1s sake.Apart from the question of supplies, there are very substantial transport difficulties in Russia.    A large pro-portion of the domestic supplies have to be conveyed very longdistances, and although the facilities are being used to capacity, they do not at present suffice to distribute to thewestern and northern parts of the Union all the oil products which they require.    The supply to Germany would be furthercomplicated by the change in the railway gauge at theformer Polish frontier.For these reasons it would appear to be very unlikelythat Russia would find it possible to export to Germany in thefirst year of war any significant quantity of petroleum.So far as Poland is concerned,  it should be rioted that nearly the whole of the oil-bearing area is in Russia&apos;s hands.We understand that three large refineries, representing 40per cent, of effective refinery capacity have been.destroyed.In any case,, the average Polish, production in recent years was only 500^000 tons per annum*

To be on the safe side,  however, we estimate thatGermany might conceivably obtain up to 500,000 tens from poland and Russia combined in the. first year,  ecual amountsbeing obtained in each period of six months.8, Roumania.Roumanian oil output in 1958 was approximately6% million tons and it is considered unlikely that this figurecan be substantially increased in the twelve months commencing1st September, 1939-      Her internal consumption in 1938 wasabout 2 million tons, and it may be taken that she has ordinarilyan exportable surplus of 4^ million tons.On the basis of the existing situation, i.e. withRoumanians oil commitments to other countries and thepresent degree of her independence from German and Russiandomination, we do not consider that Germany could obtain in thefirst year more than 2 million tons, of which not more than800,000 tons &quot;would be obtained in the first six months.Combined German and Russian pressure on Roumania, how-ever, might force her to grant additional supplies to germany at the expense of existing contracts with other countries.This would be a breach of neutrality and might cause difficul-ties for Germany with Roumani- &quot;!s other customers, notably Italy.These difficulties would doubtless be ignored;    but, in anycase, transport facilities set a limit to the amount of oil which could be sent to Germany.      Even if Germany were ineffective control of all existing means of road, rail andriver transport, we do not think that  she could obtain more than. ^ million tons a year at the outside.     Weconsider it unlikely,  however, that in practice the transportposition will be favourable enough for this total to bereached.

In the unlikely event of Germany, gaining complete control of Roumania with the oil wells undamaged, thetransport limitations would still prevent her from&apos;obtaining more than 4 million tons a year.9&apos; Other Countries.We do not consider- that there is any possibilityof Germany obtaining oil from any other petroleum-producing country in Europe.    Her only hope, therefore,of obtaining additional imports lias in evading our contraband control by organising transit or re-exporttrade through neutral countries.    This shows thenecessity of watching the re-export trade with a view tothe institution of a rationing system should occasiondemand it.    As regards transit trade, the  chief dangerappears to lie in the facility with which petroleummight- at present be routed across Italy, particularlythrough the port of Trieste.    Our success in dealingwith this transit trade will depend on the nature ofsuch agreements regarding war trade as it may be found possible to reach with Italy and with other neutralpowers adjacent to Germany, and on the efficacy ofthe contraband control measures adopted.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.10.       Germany&apos;s stocks and supplies of petroleum products from all sources for a period of 12 months from 1st September, 1939* may be summarised asfollows:-

her war reserves.    This conclusion is based on theassumption that.contraband control measures are successful in preventing the re-export of petroleumto Germany from adjacent neutral countries and that means can be found of dealing satisfactorily with the potential transit trade through Italy.12.       We are unable to say how much of Germany1s stocksof oil consists of aviation spirit and it does not follow that because her oil position generally may be critical in the Spring of next year, the suppliesof aviation spirit will then be nearing exhaustion.1J.       Finally,   we desire to call attentionto the great importance of Roumania as the .onlypetroleum-producing country in Europe from which germany can- get-any -subsJfcaDfc-jql quantities-of oil products .Signed on behalf of the Su.b-*Gojnmittee*GEOFFREY LLOYD,Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.13th October, 1939.
