ENCLOSURE.DECODE OF TSLEGRAiVl FROM PRIME MINISTER, PRETORIATO HIGH COMMISSIONER, LONDON.DESPATCHED PRETORIA - 4th October, 1939.RECEIVED LONDON - 4th October, 1939.No,410.     Your telegram of 29th September No.477, i submit following remarks on peace discussion you report.Any German peace offer now will not be sincere but will be simply meant as a peace offensive  to weaken us.It will be dangerous for two reasons.    (a) idea of peace is infectious and our entry into peace discussions at thisearly stage might have serious effects in weakening the at present firm and unanimous will to resist which is agreat moral and military asset.      (b)    Germany has justwon first round in a spectacular way and our apparentwillingness to take peace talks now might be construed byneutral and world opinion as a tacit admission that weare not certain of our ability to see the struggle through and neutrals might take hint and make terms with Germanywhile there is yet time.To my mind any peace offensive now should be net ina resolute spirit which would prevent any such defeatistImpression.     A peace offer should be met by preliminarydemand of an agreement for a restoration of the status quoante both in Czechoslovakia and Poland.     Any apparentweakening on our part at this stage would be a fatal mistake.(2)     A resolute attitude is all the more necessary as President Roosevelt made an appeal for a peace conferencebefore attack, on Poland which was contemptuously rejected by Germany.     To appear willing to enter peace talks nowwithout demanding at least Polish restoration might create a lamentable impression in America.     It is very important for our cause to keep American opinion and moral support

increasingly with us.     Indeed any peace moves which donot in some way bring United States into picture may prove a mistake.      It might be considered advisable to consult Government of United States informally on any german peace offer especially in view of president roosevelt&apos;s earlier initiative.(5)   As regards argument that Russia has alsotaken part in partition of Poland without our looking upon her as an enemy&amp; the case and guilt of Russia differmaterially from that of Germany and there is no goodground at present for assuming Russia has acted otherwise than in self defence against menace which Germany&apos;s rapidadvance constituted to her interests.     Even admitting thedisreputable character of Russia&apos;s interventions the great difference between the two cases call at present for different treatment and this should be insisted on for guidance public opinion.      It is of course possible that future developments may place Russia&apos;s action in a moresinister light but there is no reason to sssume thatat present.(4)   As against any German peace offensive afterwhat has happened I am all for an attitude of deliberatefirmness and strength and confidences     Germany1&amp; militaryweakness is greater and her moral weakness much greaterthan in 1914,     To manifold dangers of Nazism world is far more alive than it was in 1914 to menace ofPrussianisr/u      It would be fatal mistake, to undermine byweak peace moves the immensely stonger moral position weoccupy to-day.     Hitierism is universally recognised asa menace to every fundamental aspect of our Westerncivilisation.Use your influence in this direction and if you think it advisable give Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs a copy of this telegram.3  mutilated word-
