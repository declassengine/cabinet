The Report of the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee,which has been drawn up in collaboration with the Intelli-gence department of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, isattached.3. As &apos;a   next step we have considered the action necessary to draw up a plan icr achieving the objects setout in paragraph 1.4. The various items which require attention, either from the point of view of denying them to the enemy or salv-ing them for Allied use, are summarised in paragraph 20of the Report.     The Departments concerned vary from itemto item and in most cases more than one Department is con-cerned.      The action we propose in respect of various items is as follows;Gold and Negotiable Se curitjes- (paras. 10 and 11.)5. It will be for the Treasury in collaboration with theBank of England, and the Foreign Office, to examine thepossible means of getting the bullion and negotiablesecurities into some place of safety.    The transport   ofnany hundreds of tons of bullion presents o difficult problem and the loading would 10.0.0 o long time.       Theidco.1 would of con.so be to hove the gold tronsferred tothis country or to the United States of Auerica.

Dock and Harbour Facilities.(Para. 5 and Aoox. I.)6. Demolition plans should be workedOffice and Admiralty in consultation. TTrade might assist as technical advisers.be worked out by the Waration.      The Board of stocks of Raw Materials  (Paras.  11-14 a:11-14 and An ox. IV).7-We suggest that action to ensure reduction of stocks to the lowest possible level should be initiated by the Ministry of Economic Warfare, using the good offices of British firms with interests in the Low Countries.     Thedestruction of stocks of raw materials, particularly non-inflammable materials, would be a very difficult business -and we doubt whether it would be practicable in the circum-stances likely to arise.Railway rolling stopks, inland water. craft and mechanical transport.      (Para, lb&quot; and Apex, V) .8. Railway rolling stock would have to be evacuated ted intoFrance and we suggest that any arrangements necessary shouldbe made by the French by whom railway timings would have tobe given.      It would not he possible to evacuate the wholeof the rolling stock,  or even the majority, if the railways were under air attack.      In these circumstances, destructionof rolling stock would be the ne.v:t best thing.     Owing to difficulties of co-ordination, we do not recommend, however,that this should be undertaken by British personnel.9- Any inland water .cra.ft concentrated at the ports whidwere receiving attention from demolition parties (vide above)  could be dealt with as part of the port facilities.We do not think It would be practicable to undertake thedestruction or collection of craft scattered far and wideon the inland waterways themselves.10 -        Detailed plans for the evacuation cf mechanical transport would have to be left in the hands of the belgian and Dutch Authorities.     The only co-operation which theAllies could give would be to arrange for their speedyreception and traffic control behind the Allied lines.Naval Basesr Shipbuilding Yards and Shipping under construction,11.       Plans for the demolition of these facilities come under the same category as those for the destruction of.harbour facilities in &apos;6 above.-2-

Aerodrome Facilities.ISo While aorodrosnes -.are likely to jjocoivc some damageby oner-y bonbiag, laatlng daaaga cssa only be achieved-ifthe landing grounds arc ninccUCables.13.       We recommend that the Admiralty should beresponsible for disconnecting the cables from holland and Belgium.Stocks of Uranium.14.       It has been suggested that Uranium might form thebasis of a new and immensely powerful radiactive bomb.We do not know whether the Germans have succeeded in producing such a weapon but it would be better to be onthe safe side, and to restrict their supply to the czechoslovak source only.       It would not be practicable to move large stocks of raw uranium ore after the outbreakof hostilities owing to its bulk.     Unless arrangements canbe made beforehand, this would have to be left.      Informationas   to the stocks of ore and of refined uranium productsnow in Belgium could best be obtained from Lord Stonehaven,Vice-president of the Union Miniere Company who are theprincipal producers and are believed to be the only stock-holders in Belgium.     Any negotiation for the removal ofthis material, could &quot;ke carried out through the samechannel.Shinning.15.       The Board, of Tirade would be the appropriate department to deal with the question of shipping.      Ifthe proposal of the First Lord of the Admiralty containedin Paper No. W.P.(39) 57 is proceeded with, the difficulties would be to a large extent overcome.      It might be possiblein default of this, however, to arrange with Dutch and belgian owners that the shipping should be brought outof the ports to French and British ports immediately on theoutbreak of hostilities.Aircraft and Aircraft Personnel.16.       We suggest that the Air Ministry should beauthorised to make arrangements, perhaps through the medium of Imperial Airways, that the Sabena and K.L.M.Air Lines should fly out all civil aircraft to Alliedaerodromes at the beginning of a German invasion.Similar arrangements might be made for the evacuation of skilled aircraft personnel.

-4*.    -ii.   *-*Oil and Flax -Seed. -17o Arrangements to reduce stocks to the lowest possiblelimit and to bri^ surplus into Allied, territory should bemade through the Ministry of Economic &quot;Warfare.     Thedestruction of any stocks which could not be removed wouldhave to be tackled as part of the demolition plans c:; thevarious ports.Machine Tools.18. The wholesale evacuation of machine tools after the invasion has begun is out of- the question owing to transport difficultieso     Nor would the Belgian and. DutchGovernments be likely to permit any such action in anticipation of an invasion.     The most that could be donewould probably &quot;be to get away valuable and easily portableequipment such as standard gaugess measuring instrumentsetc.     The Ministry of Supply could no doubt advise on thequestion.      The Ministry of Economic Warfare could perhapsprovide, the necessary contacts with the firms concerned.Warships and Aircraft.19. With regard, to the evacuation of Service aircraft and naval crafts it seems.that the most that could be donewould be to inform the Dutch and Belgian Authorities ofthe routess harboursg and aerodromes to be used in anemergency.      In default of full Staff Conversations to concert military plans as a wholes something might be donethrough the Naval and Air Attaches.Conclusion;30. Prom the foregoing it will be seen that aconsiderable number of Departments and individuals willbe concerned in examining the methods and feasibility of achieving our object.SI. Mo,reover9 it may be found on investigation thatapproaches in certain directions are well worth pursuingexhaustively while others may soon prove abortive and haveto. be dropped,,     The question of priorities may arise,,22. There is however no time to be lost and it isessential that Departments should press on with theirpreparations as rapidly as possible.     As the French aswell as ourselves axe involved9 we have arranged;, in anticipation of the approval of the War cabinet for the&apos;problems in which the French are primarily concerned to bereferred to their Permanent Military representatives forimmediate examination.25. In view of the urgency and complexity of the whole problem we recommend that the responsibility for kee- in:?; touchwith Departments and. with the Anglo-French Liaison Sectionsand ensuring that action is proceeding expedition-:!;; :nd onthe right lines should be vested in a Minister of the WarCabinet.(Signed)    DUDLEY POUND.&quot; R.F.

HiWAR CABINET.CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.MEASURES TO BE TAKEN. Hi THE EVENT OF GERMANYOVERRUNNING HOLLAND OR&quot;BELGIUM OR BOTH.    &quot;Report by.the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee in colla-boration with the Intelligence &quot;Departiaent of the Ministryof Economic Warfare.In accordance with the instructions of the Chiefsof Staff at their 32nd Meeting., we submit the following report on the nature and location of the resources in holland and Belgium which it would be desirable to denyto the enemy or to obtain for our own use,  in the eventof an invasion of those countries by the Germans.2. This Report is concerned mainly with the economic resources of the two countries.      The safeguarding of thenaval, military and air forces themselves would, of course,be a purely operational question, in which the attitude and action of these forces most be, the biggest factor.This consideration applies particularly to the land forces.3. The Governments of Holland and Belgium are patentlyanxious to avoid doing anything that might come to theears of the.German Government and be regarded by them asa hostile act.      This attitude was exemplified by the-1-

Belgian refusal of our proposal for Staff conversations.It is therefore extremely unlikely that either ofthese Governments would agree to any joint preparationof plans for salvage or destruction.      It is possible,however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government coulddiscreetly draw their attention to the problempresented by the danger of these assets falling into German hands in the event of a German attack.His Majesty&apos;s Government could also suggest that thetwo Governments might consider, if they had not already done so,  the possibility of themselvespreparing plans to remove at short notice suchassets as might be transportables to greater safetyin the United Kingdom or Prance.      It could beadded that His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome such action on the part of Holland and Belgium andwould for their part gladly give all assistancein their power to facilitate the removal and,where removal was impossible, the destruction ofsuch assets.Maritime Resources    (see Appendix I).4o   Naval Forces.      The majority of the Dutch Navyis in the Netherlands East Indies.      Ships in home waters are light craft of no fighting value, anda few submarines.      These latter should be salvedfor our use if possibles  otherwise destroyed.There is no Belgian Navy.

g.    Shipping.,    Particulars of the Dutch and BelgianMercantile Marine are given in Appendix I,    It is reportedthat at the present time considerable Dutch tonnage is held up in home ports.   We need all the shipping we can get and Dutch shipowners, might be open to offers tocharter on reasonable terms, as the high rate of war riskinsurance is driving them out of business.6.    Docks and Harbours.    Particulars of the docks and harbours in Belgium and Holland are given .in Appendix I.It would be desirable to deny the use of these facilities to the enemy by destroying them.    In particular, the iron ore handling facilities at the Port of Rotterdam would beof great value to Germany,  since ships conveying iron ore from Sweden could move down inside territorial waters anddischarge their cargo, at Rotterdam into river craft for transport direct to the Ruhr.. Air Resources (see Appendix II.)*f* The Belgian and Dutch Air Forces are small, eachabout 200 strong.      Any spare aircraft, pilots, skilledpersonnel and material not required for immediateoperations might be moved either to England or to France,before the territory was completely overrun.     Similarlycivil aircraft could be flown out to safety.     Aerodrome&apos;facilities should be destroyed.Economic Resources.8. Neither Holland nor Belgium is self-sufficient incereals and feeding stuffs.      They are mainly manufacturingcountries and consumers of raw materials rather thanproducers.      If they were overrun by Germany she would obtain little or no economic advantage from them onceshe had consumed the existing: stocks of raw materials.-3-

They would in fact prove in the long run a liability,owing to their requirements in feeding stuffs.The machine tools in the factories would be ofno value to Germany without the necessary raw&quot; materials,and in any case she is well supplied already with machine tools.      On the other hand, some of this machinery would be of value to the Allies if it couldbe got out of the Country in time.9. In Appendix III details are given of the belgian and i)utch industries.     Estimates of the stocks held inthese countries are given in Appendix IV.     this information has been supplied by the Ministry ofEconomic warfare.     The magnitude of the problem clearlymakes- i-t jrnp^a^qti-^-abis to deny to the enemy or to removefor our own use all stocks and equipment.     The only practical proposition is to concentrate upon certain items of particular value either to the enemy or to ourselves.      These items ape oons4daj?s-cL ija- h-a-i?/sXX*wij3^paragraphs.Gold Reserves anc Securities.10. ,     The gold reserves-of Belgium and Holland amount3eto about  70 million and  110 million respectively.The total weight of this bullion, amounts to about1800 tons and its evacuation which would be a matter of theutmost importance would, present a considerable problem ifit had to ;;e undertaken in a hurry when transport facilitiewere disorganised.     At present this- gold is believed to bes tpred af&apos;^3lrLtB&amp;crllffl *,juO. &apos;the-4Iag.uft ^pfipe^tjivftlyj.. -lie!the r ofwhich is very well placed for its rapid evacuation inan emergency.liqte: II.M. Treasury has particularly requested -chatthis information, which is highly confidentialshould circumstances be divulged.

11.        In addition, both countries have large surasinvested overseas which,  in the case of American companies,are largely represented by bearer bonds and stocks, the negotiation of which it would be difficult to prevent.The total value of these bearer bonds is believed to beabout  200 million,  of which the larger part belongs to holland.      It would be of the utmost importance to ensurethat these valuable assets did not fall into the handsof Germany, and it is possible that the banks might beprepared to ship them to New York if cheap war riskinsurance could be provided.Raw Materials.;12.    0j.1.      Present stocks of oils of various natures are estimated as follows (vide Appendix IV paragraph 3,4,24.and 25Belgium. Holland.Tons. Tons,(a) Mineral oils. 200-250,000 750,000(b) Oil seeds,vegetable oiland whale oil. 12,000 56,000Of the 56,000 tons of oil, other than mineral, in Holland,.29,000 tons consist of British owned whale oil waiting tobe- hardened for the account of Unilever Ltd.. , London.The Dutch Government refuses to release this oil exceptagainst the equivalent amount of vegetable oil.1S*    flax,    Belgium is one of the principal flax producing countries of Europe.      The other two chief flax producingareas are in the Baltic States and the U.S*S,R, and if Belgium,mwe or are, \:5Q ^^fl/1^1 -fe depend on our Northern Irelandsupplies until fresh areas were brought under cultivation.

Stocks should therefore be evacuated If possible.      Itwould be essential to get out of Belgium sufficient flaxseed to start new cultivation going.      The destruction ofany growing crops should be ensured-,14.    Other raw materials.      The more important stocks ofother raw materials now in Holland and Belgium arethose of non-ferrous metals, chiefly zinc;     6op-poo? and tinleather;    and also small but valuable stocks of nolybdonum,feEWTO-manganosowolfram, chrome, antimony, nickel, etc.15 .       A number of British firms have commercial interestsin Holland and Belgium; it might be possible to use their influence to secure a reduction of these stocks of rawmaterials to the lowest possible level.      These firms areas follows:-(i) Copper)Tin      ) British Metal Corporation.Zinc    )lily   C 0&quot;D&quot;D GX* )Cobalt) Rhokana Corporation.(iii) Industrial Diamonds.    Diamond Corporation.(iv) Nickel. Mond Nickel Co. Ltd.Societe de Nickel, Le H^vre(through French Mission)(v) Iron and steel and Ferro- (through French Mission),alloys,,(vi) Vegetable oils. Unilever Limited,(vii)  Oil Shell Transport.Transportation.    (vide Appendix V).l6.       The chief items of importance to Germany are:-(i) Rolling stock,  including tank wagons and, inparticular,  the Belgian heavy freightlocomotives -(ii) Dutch i... . :.:::.&amp; water craft suitable for Rhine traffic,(iii) Ileav;;/ road vehicles in both countries.

The problem of evacuating large quantities of rolling stockacross the frontiers into Prance would be a difficult one,particularly under air attack,,Armament and Aircraft industry    (vide Appendix VI)ffl17. The armament industry of both countries is of minor importance and chiefly concerned with small arms.    Theaircraft industry is also on a small scale and is confined to the manufacture of airframes only.     There is no aero-engine industry in either country       The maximum output isprobably less than 40 airframes per month, in either country.Particulars are given in Appendix VI of 11 lightnaval craft and 9 submarines which are believed to be under construction in Dutch shipyards,.Cable So-18o Except for one Italian owned cable from La Panne toLisbon all overseas cables from Belgium and Holland lead toEngland and can easily be disconnected.Uranium,,19.       Certain stocks of Uranium which is a potential source of atomic energy are held in Belgium by the Union Miniere duHaut Katanga,,    The only sources of Supply are in Czechoslova-kia, the Belgian Congo and Canada^     Scientific experimentswith the object of using this ore as a source of energy or as an explosive have been inconclusive, but steps should betaken to remove or destroy Belgian stocks in case Germanscientists should succeed in utilising its potential energyPConclusions..,20*         The most important of the resources in Belgium and holland, which it would be desirable to deny to the enemy,in order of priority in each category are;-(a)    From the Economic point.....of^vigw.(i)    Gold and negotiable securities (Paragraphs10 and 11)o(ii)    Dock and harbour facilities, especially at rotterdam (paragraph 5 and Appendix I).(i-ii)    Stocks of raw materials, especially oil and flax(Paragraphs 11-14 and Appendix IV).(iv)    Railway rolling stock, inland water craft and mechanical transport (Paragraph 15 and appendix V)0

(b) From the Naval point of view-,(i) Submarines under construction (Appendix VI para. 5(e)c(ii) Naval seaplane station at Veire (Appendix I para. 5).(iii) Dockyard.,  submarine and mine depot at Willemsoord(Appendix I para..  6):(iv) The shipbuilding, operational and base-facilities atAmsterdamYmuiden (including the Orange Locks machinery),Rotterdam.Middle sburg.Flushing..-Antwerp.In this connection,  it is considered that special care should be taken to ensure the destruction of all dredgers,dredging machinery and navigational aids.Note.    The Naval Staff have prepared plans for blockingZeebrugge and 0 stend,(c) From the Air point of view.Aerodrome facilities (Paragraph 6 and Appendix II).(d) Stocks of Uranium (paragraph 19&apos;).21.       The most important resources which we could utilise are -(a) Shipping (paragraph 4).(b) Civil and military aircraft and trained personnel  (paragraph 6),(c) Oil (paragraph 11),(d) Flax seed and, if possible stocks (paragraph 12).22.        Little can be done towards destroying or salvingthese resources unless plans can be prepared beforehandpreferably in conjunction with the Dutch and Belgianauthorities.25.        For destruction of stocks and installations onany considerable scale,  specially trained field engineerunits would have to be held in readiness,  suitably equipped and with all f-rar g ...:.?r4-c&apos; ]  in advance.    For this an

early decision is essential.    The objectives which they could most profitably tackle would be those at or near to the portsor the French frontiers, since the personnel could then be ,.withdrawn at the last moment.    Any destruction carried out byagents left behind after the Germans had overrun the country would be on a very small scale and could not be expected tohave any appreciable effect.    The War Office are making a preliminary investigation &apos;(so far as this can be done withoutReconnaissance) of the objectives which could suitably be attacked and the methods of destruction which could beemployed.24.       While other plans are in preparation it is suggestedthat the Foreign Office should be requested to take action onthe lines indicated in paragraph 3 above-and that the Ministryof Economic Warfare,  in conjunction with other interested departments might approach the firms concerned with the objects -(a) Of suggesting to Dutch Banks the desirabilityof transferring securities to the United(States of America (vide Paragraph 10).(b) Of securing a reduction in the stocks of rawmaterials maintained in Belgiun and Holland,(vide paragraph 14).(Signed) R.C.

APPENDIX VI.ARMAMENTS INDUSTRY.BELGIUM.I.    Land Armamentso(a) The Belgian Armament industry consists of - certainstate factories and a number of private firms witha considerable capacity for manufacturing rifles and small arms ammunition.(h) Only one firm (Cockerill) is capable of manufacturing guns on any scale.(c) There are numerous small explosives factories allcontrolled by the Government,(d) There is no manufacture of Tanks.    Cockerill could make chassis and armour but engines wouldhave to be imported.(e) Belgium has imported anti-aircraft and otherartillery on a considerable scale from theSwedish firm Bofors.      She exports&apos; rifles,cartridges and machine guns.(f) Fabrique nationale d&apos;armes de guerre. Luettich(Liege) hold colt M.G. licence for Europe and aBofors licence for 3.22 A.A.  guns.&apos;2.     Naval Vessels.Until very recently Belgium has not built naval vessels, but in November, 1938 it was announced that theGovernment had decided to build a &quot;police&quot; or Tisheryprotection&quot; vessel.      The new ship was to be built at theHoboken Yard at Antwerp, to be about 2,000 tons with a speed of 22 knots, to be armed with guns and to be generally modelled on the Italian torpedo boat &quot;Grecale&quot;.3e     Aircraft.The outstanding features of the Belgian aircraft industry are:-(a) It cannot from its own resources producecomplete aircraft.     All aero-engines ofmilitary significance and certain other components must be imported.

(b) It is concentrated almost wholly in thefollowing firms of which the output of the &apos;last two is negligible..V    \  &apos; . . &apos; &apos; .      &apos;S.A.B.O.A. at Brussels.Avions Pairey at GosselScStampe et Vertigan at Antwerp.Penard at Brussels.(c) Actual output in recent years has notexceeded 75 aircraft p.a.(d) If efficiency of management and equipmentwere better, available space would permit a maximum output of 450 airplanes per annum.HOLLAND.4.     Land Armaments0This industry is weak and consists of theGovernment Arsenal where field guns and machine guns areassembled, three firms manufacturing component parts, acartridge factory and two factories which manufactureexplosives.In addition, the following two firms would be of use for armament purposes:-lo    H. Staaigietery, Zuylen near Utrecht wheresteel castings up to 80 tons can bemanufa c ture d02o    V/alzwerk van Leer at Velsen which has some ofthe finest rolling mills in Europe for steelplates.All gun barrels, heavy guns and anti-aircraft guns aresupplied by Bofors, Sweden. &quot;    Machine guns fromFabrique Rationale Liege.

i P o -5.   Naval Armaments.The following programs is under consideration or in hand*(a) Two cruisers of 8,300 tons with 10 5.9&quot; guns and 21&quot; torpedoes each (projected hut not yet started).(b) One flotilla leader 3,350 tons with 6 5*9&quot; guns.   Workbegun October, 1938 and due for finishing sometime in1940.(c) Six destroyers of 1,620 tons each are in hand and afurther two are projected.(d) Licence has been obtained from the U.K. to manufacturemotor torpedo boats.      19 are projected.    One ordered by the  Dutch Navy from U.K. has just been completed.(e) Nine submarines of which two are just completed. &quot;two are to be launched in December, 1939 and two in March1940    (No information regarding the other three).(f) Three &apos;gun boats (building).(g) One minelayer (finished - believed to be ready forcommissioning..)(h) Six mine-sweepers (Projected)s6.   Aircraft.- There are two up to date aircraft factories:-Koolhoven Vliegtuigen, Rotterdam.&apos; Fokker, Amsterdam.In addition the following three firms together makeDornier bombers.Aviolanda, Rotterdam.De Schelde, Vlissingen.Werkspoor, Amsterdam.The capacity of the Industry as a whole probably does notexceed 20 machines a month.There is one Company, N.V. Kromhart, Mo tor en. PabrikAmsterdam which manufactures Armstrong Siddeley GenetEngines under licence.     Production, however, is extremelysmall.
