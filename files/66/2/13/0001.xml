Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1939.jSECRET. V Copy No.W.P. (39) 63. ^TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that speciai ca; o may be-taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.RESULTS OF TREATY NEGOTIATIONS WITH TURKEY.I CIRCULATED to my colleagues on the 20th September the text of thex\nglo-Franco-Turkish political treaty [W.P. (39) 40]. The treaty, together withthe military convention and the financial agreement, with which I deal below,were initialled at Angora by the British and French representatives and by theSecretary-General of the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the28th September. The Turkish Government expressed the hope at the time thatthe fact that initialling had taken place should be kept secret pending the return of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs from Moscow. They did not,however, themselves observe this stipulation, but allowed the news to be issued on the 29th September, with the result, of course, that publicity in the press has followed.2. I drew attention in the memorandum of the 20th September[W.P. (39) 40] to the fact that the second protocol to the treaty, covering thepoint thai Turkey could undertake no obligation involving her in hostilities withRussia, was to be kept confidential. The Turkish Government have not kept this condition, but have allowed it to be known that this protocol exists, no doubt inorder to assist their Minister for Foreign Affairs in his talks at Moscow. I donot think that the point matters much, but in the light of what has occurred, Ihave now suggested that the second protocol should be published in full whenthe rest of the treaty is made public. It is more important that the separateexchange of notes, engaging the United Kingdom and France to assist Turkeywhen an attack by a European Power reaches the frontiers of Bulgaria or Greece,should be kept secret, and I have expressed the hope to the Turkish Governmentthat they will adhere to this condition.3. Subject to the foregoing remarks, I do not think any further commentis required on the text of the political agreement, which was approved by the WarCabinet on the 21st September [War Cabinet Conclusions 22 (39) ]. I should,however, mention that a minor point is that, in order to meet a Turkish constitu-tional requirement, a provision has been added in all three annexes to the political agreement specifying that each is an integral part of the treaty itself. I havenot yet received the wording of this provision, which has not accordingly been included in the political agreement of which I annex copies for convenience ofreference.  (Annex A.)4.   The military convention, of which the text is attached (Annex B), was concluded at the instance of the Turkish Government.   It was negotiated inAngora in August between the Turkish General Staff and a French military[20069] B
officer, General Huntziger. The British Military Attache in Angora was presentduring the discussions. The text of the draft convention was brought to london by General Huntziger and accepted by the Deputy Chiefs of Staff. With a fewminor amendments it was approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government.5. The convention, among other things, defines the measures to be taken asregards (1) the Dodecanese in the event of war with Italy (Article 3),(2) the defence of Salonika (Article 4), and(3) assistance to be given to Roumania in the event of aggression against their by a third Power (Article 6). The main feature of the convention is that, as the Prime Minister wrote in his letter to M. Daladier onthe 11th August expressing his appreciation of General Huntziger&apos;work, it includes all the points we would wish to include without involving us in any undesirable commitments.6. The final text of the financial agreement was despatched by bag fromAngora on the 30th September and should be available early this week. Theagreement defines the forms of financial assistance which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the French Government have agreed to give to Turkey, namely :(1)  25 million credit for the purchase of war material in the UnitedKingdom and France,(2) a gold loan of  15 million, and(3) a loan of (a)  2 million (from His Majesty&apos;s Government) and (&amp;) the equivalent in francs of  1-1 million (from the French Government), tobe used primarily for liquidating frozen balances in the Anglo-Turkish and Franco-Turkish Clearings respectively.7. The agreement provides further that a Turkish military mission shall come to London in order to draw up a programme for the supply of the warmaterial to be purchased under the  25 million credit [(1) above], and also toreach agreement in regard to that part of this material of which Turkey is inurgent need for the defence of her Thracian frontier. Finally, by the &quot; suspense &quot;clause, it is agreed that the political treaty shall not come into force until this war material, urgently needed, has been delivered. It has been made quite clear to the Turkish Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the FrenchGovernment, for their part, are under no obligation to hand over the  15 million gold until the treaty comes into force.8. The proportions in which His Majesty&apos;s Government and the FrenchGovernment are to provide &quot;the armaments credit and the gold loan have still to be decided between the two Governments. The present position is that, ofthe armaments credit, His Majesty&apos;s Government have already granted 10 million and the French Government 460 million francs. As regards the 15 million gold loan, the French Government have so far refused to contributemore than  4 million, but are being pressed to increase their share.H.October 1, 1939.

They will be preceded as faras possible by naval and air action, with a view to gaining command of the sea and air, to isolate the islands in question, and to immobilize their garrison.The plans to be adopted for these operations (organisation of command,successive phases of the operation and corresponding objectives, forces to beemployed, collection and preparation of the necessary transport, protection of landing parties, &amp;c), will be drawn up in the course of discussion between the staffs concerned when the present military convention has been put into force.French participation will include air forces brought from the Levant, forwhich air bases in Turkish territory will be equipped in time of peace.Article 4.The Contracting Governments recognise the importance, in the event of aggression by a third Power, of not allowing this third Power to seize Salonika;and of making the defence against the common enemy in this region inter-alliedin character from the outset.It is, however, understood that the defence of Greek territory is essentially the task of the Greek Army.As regards the measures to be taken for the integrity of the territory of greek Thrace, and for the maintenance of communications with TurkishThrace, the Turkish Army will help in the threatened zone in accordancewith the general conditions outlined in Article 2.It is admitted that any action by sea with a view to hampering the enemy&apos;scommunications in the lower Adriatic and Ionian Sea would be an effectual aid to action on land for the defence of Salonika.
France is ready to help at the outset in the defence of the Salonika regionwith an expeditionary force transported from the Levant under conditions tobe stated below.With a view tp facilitating liaison between the allied forces operating inthe Balkan theatre and neighbouring maritime regions, and in order to co-ordinatetheir activities, France is ready to send a high military officer to Salonika.The Turkish Staff agrees to inform the Greek Staff of these measures, andif possible to examine the initial measures to be taken in consequence in Greekterritory.   British and French Staffs will be kept informed of these contacts.Article 5.Turkey agrees to facilitate the transport of Allied Forces through her territory and through the Sea of Marmora.

It is understood that troops coming by rail from the Levant throughTurkish territory will use the same trains from one end of the journey to theother and that these trains will be sent back as soon as. possible to their stationsof origin.3. Moreover, subject to agreement with the Turkish Authorities, the allied forces shall be allowed to organise and provision bases for their own use in turkish harbours and aerodromes. The necessary understandings will bearranged in peace-time between the Staffs concerned.Article 6.The Contracting Governments recognise that in the event of aggression bya third Power against Roumania, the defence of Roumania is, in the first instance,the task of the Roumanian Army.2.
