this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT        1 2TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.- COPY NO^&apos;    WAR CABINET.CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE..NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE TURKISH MISSION.Note by the Chiefs of Staff.Present Position.I A Meeting of Ministers on 2nd October, 1939s at which the Chiefs of Staff were present, approved the general lines which the. British and French Permanent Military-Representatives should take in their discussions with theTurkish Mission.2. The main points made ware:-Firstly, that everything within our power should bedone to meet the Turkish requirements without endangeringthe safety of the Allied Forces in France or the defence ofGreat Britain.Secondly, that it was Important to gain time in thediscussions until the Treaty had been signed, and that everything should be done to avoid revealing how far thecupboard was bare for fear of undesirable Turkish reactionsbefore the signatures were appended to the Treaty.5. At this time it was gene rail;- envisaged that theAnglo-Franco-Turkish Treat1, would be signed within a fewdays of General Orbay&apos;s arrival in England.First Plenary Meeting.4. The first plenary Meeting between the British andFrench Representatives and the Turkish Mission took place onWednesday,   4th October, 1939-      The Meeting was confined toa general discussion.      Detailed examination of the Turkishlists of requirements, both those submitted before the Warand those contained in their later and &quot;immediate&quot; list,was delegated to sub-committee work with technical experts present.     While it had always been appreciated thatit would be impossible to meet all the Turkish demands, thereis little doubt that the collective French and British offerscan be made auite attractive.Technical Discussions.5. Technical discussions to examine and clarify theTurkish demands were carried out on the 5th, 6th and 7thOctober.      So far no indication has been given to GeneralOrbay as to what can and what cannot be done to meet hisimmediate requirements.

 * I. dFuture P r o c edure.6. As a result of the prolongation of the visit ofthe Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs to Moscow, itis now probable that the signature of the Treaty will be postponed for some time.It is evident that in this inter-regnum    everything possible must be done to prevent an actual deadlock withthe Turks,     At the same time,, it is impossible for theY Permanent Military Representatives to postpone showingtheir hand as regards what can in fact be supplied to turkey.7- General Orbay himself has expressed the hopethat the difficulties with the Soviet, and consequentialdelay in signing the Treaty, would not result in a delay in supplying Turkey with the materials she urgentlyrequire,&apos;:. .    - Delay and procrastination is. foreign to theTurkish soldier and in particular to Marshal FevziChakmak, and he Is only likely to interpret any such,action as lack of goodwill or bureaucratic&quot;incompetence.The Turkish General Staffs support may only last so longas they are convinced of British sincerity.      Thewithdrawal of their support will play into the hands ofthe pro-Germans, of which Turkish business men with longconnections with Germany are a factor not to be lightlyneglected.Offers of Troops to Turkey in the Event of War.8. The possibility of making an offer to theTurkish Mission of Military assistance in- the event ofTurkey being engaged in War,, with a view to the omission of the &quot;suspensive&quot; clause in the Treaty, has receivedpreliminary consideration by the Chiefs of Staff.      Thequestion has been referred to the French to obtain theirviews and the extent to which French Military assistance could be promised, but no reply has as yet been received.Next Plenary Meeting.9. The Second plenary Meeting of the British andFrench Representatives with the Turkish Mission hasalready been arranged lor 11 a.m.  on Monday, 9thOctober.      The Representatives appreciate that thesituation has changed from that which applied lastweek, but they are reluctant to suggest a postponement of this meeting lor fear of confirming any impressionwhich may already be latent in the mind of GeneralOrbay that attempts are being made to delay matters.It is intended at this meeting to avoid making any definite promise of equipment to the Turks beyond.(a)    what we had already contracted to supply to them before the warjand,      (b)    what is already in the S.S.   &quot;Lassell&quot; and&quot;Clan Menzies&quot; in Istambul (already promised them)

21km&apos;.&quot;but to indicate generally those items of war and rawmaterial which we could deliver fairly soon, and alsoindicate those items.not available in the nearfuture, but which the Turks might obtain more easilyfrom a neutral country such as the U. S. A. or Sweden..   . &apos;v f   f &apos;     $ f:;&apos;f   r fwfwff;In this way, it is hoped to get through this meetingwithout conveying the impression of reluctance on our part tsupply equipmenti but this position can no longer- be held.Directions to British Representatives.10.       Subject to the approval of the Cabinet, we therefore propose to issue the following instructions to the BritishPermanent Military Representativess-(a) The Turkish Mission may nor be informed of the extent to which all their outstandingdemands can be fulfilled.     This would include thelatest and &quot;immediate&quot; list on which the fate of the&quot;suspensive&quot; clause is believed to depend. .(b) Those items of the pre-war demands whichcan be supplied (whether already contracted for ornot) may now be shipped to Turkey.(c) Such offers or promises now made should not be conditional upon theTreaty being signed.(d) Actual shipment of such material in thelatest and &quot;immediate&quot; list  .-s can bo suppliedshould commence as soon as practicable.The question of making an offer of military asristancas a counter to mateiwial assistance will be referred to theCabinet whan the French reactions have been obtained.(Signad)  R.2.C. PEIRSE (for C.A.8.)&quot; R.F.  ADAM    (for C.I.G.S.)&quot; T.S.V. PHILLIPr  (for C.N.f.);hmond Terrace, S.W.I.,8th October, 1939-
