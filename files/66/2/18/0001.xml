IMINISTRY OP INFORMATION. VRevised draft statement to be madeby the Prime Minister in the Hou.seof Commons0(Reference:    W.M.(39) 3Uth Conclusions;, Minute 18).Note by the Secretary^I circulate by the Prime Minister&apos;s direction,for the information of the War Cabinet, the attached revised draft Statement which he proposes to make in the Houseof Commons on the subject of the changes&quot;in   the Ministryof Information.(Signed)    E.E, BRIDGES,Righmond Terrace, S.W.1.2nd October, 1939.

as I stated on Thursday last, the responsibilityof the Ministry of Information for news has not extendedin any way beyond the provision of means for itscommunication to the Press0     A review has now been madeof the arrangements for the distribution of news, includingthe question of direct contact between the Press and theDepartments.      The subject has been fully discussed withthe representatives of the Press with a view to meetingtheir convenience in the matter.As a result it has been decided that there shallbe a reversion to the practice existing prior to theoutbreak of war, whereby the Press representatives haddirect contact with the various Government Departments,those Departments themselves furnishing the Press with allofficial communications in such manner as was found most appropriate.     Each Department will therefore now make itsown arrangements for communicating news to the Pressrepresentatives^It has, however, been represented to the minister that the mechanical facilities provided in the buildingoccupied by the Ministry for the receipt and distributionof Government communications have proved of greatconvenience to a large section of the Press.     There is no present intention to do away with these facilities, whichwill continue to be utilised as a channel by which officialcommunications will be issued to the Press.   - In any case inwhich official communications are made direct by Departments,the same communications will be issued through the centralchannel.I should add that some difficulty must be expected in connection with the supply and distribution of news intime of war:    the revised arrangements now proposed are intended to reduce difficulties to a minimum and I feel sure that I can rely upon the Press to co-operate in their-1-

smooth working.The new arrangements will come into force onMonday morning next.as regards the censorship? which is at presenthoused at the Ministry.of Information, the responsibilityfor censorship must rest, like the responsibility for news and its distribution, upon the Departments which areconcerned with the subject matter.     Departments wills ofcourse, exercise their own censorship as regards the newsthat they give out.     The censorship    which, as the house will realise, is concerned only with material or messagesvoluntarily submitted by the Press will, as before^ be operated by Censor Officers guided hy the directions ofthe Departments,.In the event of questions arising as to anyparticular censorship operation, the Liinister in charge ofthe Department   affected will answer for it in Parliament.Sir Walter lionclcton has been appointed controller of Censorship;    he will at the same time supervise thearrangements for the central communication of news tothe Press.
