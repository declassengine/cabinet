The War Cabinet at their meeting on the and ofOctober were informed that the Prime Minister of Australiahad made urgent enquiry as to the implications of the intervention of Russia on the side of Germany,They agreed-&quot;That in order to meet, the request of thePrime Minister of Australia as soon aspossible.,  the Chiefs of Staff should prepare a brief Appreciation of theMilitary position which would be created in the event of Russia declaring war, andco-operating with Germany by militaryac determination  &quot;X2, At their meeting on 6th October when they had underconsideration aiRcpcrt on the strategy to be adoptedin the Near East,  (W.P., (39) 70) prepared by the British andFrench Permanent Military Representatives in collaboration,the War Cabinet agreed to invite the Chiefs of Staff;-&quot;as a corollary to this Report to examine thepossibilities of action by Russia in the balkans,  acting either alone or in concertwi th G e germany,&apos;;3. The Appreciation which we now submit is rendered in fulfilment of the above instructions.- We have found itoonvenien&apos;0 to cover both questions in a single document.4,. In our examination of these problems, we have foundthat it would be quite possible for Russia to do serious harm to the Allied cause while remaining nominally neutral,      Wehave,  therefore,  thought it right,  although not strictlywithin our Terms of Reference,  to include in the AppreciationW.M.(39) 34th Conclusions, Minute 14.x- W.M, (39) 39th Conclusions,  Minute 7,

the military implications of a Russia benevolently-neutraltowards Germany hut aot actually hostile to us,5. Political Assumptions.We are advised by the Foreign Office that theattitude of other Powers to the present situation may beexpected to be as followsJAPAN will do nothing to assist Germany and Russiabut will use the opportunity to obtain all possible concessions from the Allies,ITALY will not care for a German-Soviet combination, but may be tempted to join it if she thinks it is likely to bethe winning side.TURKEY will be much embarrassed and is unlikely tofight Russia.      If Italy tomes in against us, Turkey may help us provided she can do so without herself coming intoconflict with Russia.GREECEVi11 be much influenced by the Turkish attitude.ROUMANIA, BULGARIA, YUGOSLAVIA and HUNGARY will be atthe mercy of Germany and Russia and cannot be expedted to offerserious resistance to a combination of these two Powers.SPAIN will be anti-Bolshevik but may be influenced bythe attitude of Italy and the prospect of gain from the war(Tangier, Gibraltar),THE BALTIC STATES and FINLAND are helpless in the face of Russian aggression,IRAN,  IRAQ, and AFGHANISTAN if attacked, would resistif adequately supported.

gussian Pojlicyo6* JRussia1 s abiding aim is to spread world revolution, &quot;0To this end she will doubtless try to extend her influence as and where she can, and in particular to regain her oldterritories in order to improve her strategical position and toform fresh centres of propaganda0   She would prefer a weakGermany as her neighbour and she certainly does not want Germanpenetration into the Balkans down to the Black Sea,    If she could ensure thac not only Germany, but also the British Empire,emerged exhausted from the struggle she would, serve her ownends best.7. In spite of her great man power and natural resources, wedo not consider that Russia is likely to embark on activehostilities which are liable to lead to a heavy military commitment.   Any economic assistance, which she renders to germany would correspondingly restrict her military activities and vice versa.    In particular It would impose a heavy strain on hertransport system, which is one of the weakest, links in hernational organisation.    She may well doubt the capacity of her military forces to sustain large scale operations against a first-class power outside Russian territory.    Moreover, sheprobably realises that a war with us would give us theopportunity to build up a new Anti-Comintern Front among thepowers dissatisfied with the German-Russian Agreement.RUSSIA NOMINALLY NEUTRAL.8. We consider first the military implications of a Russiabenevolently neutral towards Germany though not in a state ofwar with the Allies..Propaganda.9. In the first place this state of affairs would provideRussia with a golden opportunity of extending the field ofCommunistic activities throughout the world.    There are alreadyindications, both in France and Great Britain, that theCommunist Party are aligning themselves with the pacifistmovement. It is clear that immediate and far reaching steps mustbe taken if Russian propaganda.is to be met.    This applies

particularly to Iran;, Iraq and Afghanistan,&apos;&amp;conqmlc Assistance to Germany.10.       Russia could, without talcing military action,  renderGermany the maximum economic assistance within her power and -thus make good,  to a limited extent,  German deficiencies incertain raw materials.      This might involve a further reductionin the Russian standard of living, which is already low, huteven then Germany would not he immune in the long run from our economic pressure,  although its action would he slowed up.11.        In South-Eastern Europe it seems that Russia may haveblocked Germany&apos;s way, and this presents us with the more immediate threat of an offensive In the West.      On the otherhand Germany might feel that In view of her improved economic position she could afford to play a waiting game for the timebeing.      She might refrain from an early offensive in theWest,  in the hope that if the present inaction continued throughout the winter,  the pressure of neutral opinion and ofour own peoples   would force us to negotiate peace while her military strength was still unimpaired,,Direct Military,, Assistance to Germany.12.        Even though nominally neutral, Russia might adopt the&quot;non-intervention18 tactics of the Spanish War and permit theGermans to use her Naval and Air bases.      She might even makeover some of her warships and aircraft to Germany.      Suchaction would, afford Germany direct support-.Indirect Assistance to Germany..13.        On land and. in the air there are certain steps that Russiacould take,  either alone or in concert with Germany, which wouldnot necessarily involve her In war with the Allies,    These wouldmainly profit herself,  though some would indirectly assistGermany by locking up Allied forces in secondary theatres ofwar to the serious embarrassment of the Allies.      She mightachieve these diversions mainly by the extensive use of propaganda,  combined perhaps with the threat of military action,while confining her actual military commitment to the minimum.

140       The secondary theatres are as follows(a)   The Baltic.All the Baltic States are likely to fall to.Russia,without any military action on her part.      Finland mightresist far reaching demands hut would eventually he forcedto give in.      No immediate threat    to British interests would fee involved,(fe)    The Balkans.The Russian annexation of Bessarafeia seems quite possible and Bulgaria might take over that part of theDobrudja to which she lays claim, probably with Russianconnivance.      While the possibility of a German-RussianAgreement to partition Roumania cannot be entirely excluded,it does not seem likely that Russia would wish Germany to penetrate further towards the Black Sea and the Straits.Germany&apos;s requirements from Roumania are, moreover,economic and so long as these are satisfied she appearsunlikely to attack in this direction, especially asHungary would probably resist the passage of German troops.Although the Balkan Pact requires Turkey to assistRoumania against Bulgaria, it is possible that Turkey mightnot intervene in such a situation in view of her presentundefined relations with Russia.      Moreover, there is nothing that the allies could do to assist Roumania.While we do not rule out entirely the possibilityof concerted action in South-Eastern Europe with a view todividing the Balkans into German and Russian spheres of influence, there are at the moment no indications of suchaction.

(c) Caucasian Frontier.Action against Turkey through the Caucasus seemsimprobable but a concentration of force by Russia on her ownside of the frontier would probably keep Turkey neutrals,(d) Iran.It would be an easy matter for Russia to penetrateboth with propaganda and with small military forces into thenorthern provinces of Iran.    Iran is particularly susceptible to propaganda and her forces are of a very low category*Should such penetration develop Into an actual militarythreat to the Anglo-Iranian oilfields, we could not avoidopen hostilities with Russia.(e) Iraq,.Russian penetration in Iran would cause disturbances in Iraq and might threaten the security of our overlandcommunications from the Persian Gulf to Egypt.    The serious-ness of such a threat would depend on whether Italy washostile or neutral.      With Italy hostile and the Red sea route uncertain, the security of the overland route would beof great importance.    We should probably only be able to drawfrom India the necessary forces to safeguard it0(f) Afghanistan.The absorption of the Northern Provinces of afghanistan by Russia is a feasible proposition.    This   might&quot;cause the fall of the Afghan Government and the consequentunrest would spread to India.    Our Internal securityproblem there would be seriously increased by Bolshevik propaganda.    India as a source of reserves might be driedup and we might even have to reinforce the country.

Further Russian action in China and Manchria is unlikely for the present, but this state of affairs willcontinue only so long as it suits Russia.    Her inactionin this area is to our disadvantage in that it tends to free Japan&apos;s hands.RUSSIA OPENLY HOSTILE.-,15o We now turn to the situation that might develop ia state of war were to exist between Russia and. ourselvesAt Sea.16. Home Wapers and Baltico    Russian hostility wouldmean a large increase in the total submarine strength ofour enemies, though the Russian submarines may be less efficient than the German.    With the addition of Russiansubmarines operating from German bases, the submarinemenace in Home Waters would be intensified, andwe should have to expect greater lossese    Even if theGermans would, not trust the Russians far enough towithdraw all surface forces from the Baltic, moredetermined action by German surface vessels would have tobe expected.    The availability of the ice-free port ofMurmansk would broaden the base of the enemy&apos;s naval operations, particularly those of his raidersn    Thearrangements already in force to deal with German trade would, be applicable to Russian trade in Northern waters and into the Baltic.

oi r*10&apos;317o       Black Sea and Mediterraheario      Our activities in eastern Mediterranean are largely conditioned by thecircumstances of Italy4 s attitude towards us.      We assume that, with Italy hostile, Turkey would join the allies-but it seems certain in vie?/ of Russo-Turkish relationsthat our naval forces would be excluded from the black sea.      Contraband control would be established, in theDardanelles however, and Russia would be effectively cutoff from the Mediterranean..        With Italy and Turkey bothneutral,  our warships would still be excluded from the black Sea, and there would be no contraband control in theDardanelles themselves..      the most we could do would be toestablish a patrol outside the Dardanelles for contraband control and to prevent- the     egress of Russian submarines.18-       Far East.      Considerable submarine forces and somelight surface forces are based      Vladivostok.     Attack lysubmarines and mining as far south as Hong Kong would be apossibility,  though the freedom of action of Russian naval forces in this area would be hampered to some extent byuncertainty as. to the attitude of Japan.-;    These threatswould call for the strengthening of our depleted, naval forces in China, which would be difficult even if italy were neutral.19.        Vladivostok plays an important part in the economic life of Eastern Russia, but owing to lack of bases we- could do little against Russian trade in this area,  except to alimited extent by contraband control in Canada, applied teRussian imports from America.

20o On land and in the air direct Russian co-operationwith Germany seems unlikely on any appreciable scale forthe following reasons:-(a) If the large forces which Germany can employin the West (up to 100 divisions)  cannotbring her victory additional Russian forces will noto(b) Germany already has a preponderance in aircraft and Russian types are, for the most part,obsolescent]ascent.(c) There would be political dangers to germany in the acceptance of Russian troops - on hersoilcRussians direct co-operation would thereforeprobably be limited to the supply of some technical troops and certain types of aircraft for use on the WesternPronto21o Indirectly she could contribute to Germany&apos;seffort and cause us grave embarrassment by extending thescope of her operations in Central Asio as follows:-(a) Iran and Iraq0Prom the military point of view it would benecessary for us to step in, even at the cost of declaring war on Russia if and when our interestsin the Anglo-Iranian and Mosul oil fields werethreatened; or with a hostile Italy, if ouroverland communications in the Middle East weremenaced.      This situation might require,  inaddition to reinforcements from India, thewithdrawal of forces from the Middle East, In the face of a hostile Italy this might not be possible.(b) Afghanistan , and,. India.Prom advanced bases in the Northern provinces of Afghanistan Russia might undertake long rangeair action against objectives in India.    Althoughany large scale attacks are unlikely, even a lightscale would make the internal security problem acute0No reinforcements could then be drawn from India;and, worse still,  there would be loud andinsistent calls from India for land and air re-infercements, particularly the latter.    These couldnot be provided unless Italy were definitelyfriendly.

SY   SWgnnmapy of Conclusions on Russian Co-operation with Germany *224       (a) Russian propaganda, particularly in the middle east, which is an immediate menace tc our interests would he intensified.    Urgentsteps should he taken to counter this.(h) German-Russian economic co-operation would slowup the effect of our economic pressure on germany, and she might feel she could afford to play a waiting game,, -(c) Russian intervention may have blocked the way in South-Eastern Europe to German penetration,but at the same time it protects to someextent Germany&apos;s flank and rear0    Inconsequence the West is more than ever the decisive front and is likely to be the scene of any immediate German offensive.    DirectRussian co-operation on the Western Frontwould probably be limited in character.(d) It is by   penetration into Iran, Iraq, and afghanistan that Russia could cause us themost serious embarrassment,,    This combined w^itha hostile Italy would present a problem almostinsoluble with our present resources in theMiddle East.    Even with Italy neutral theposition would be most serious0    Only if italy were definitely friendly,  could we afford todenude the Middle East of land and air forcesin order to reinforce the threatened area..(e) The danger of Japanese alliance with Germany has passed but the lapse of Russian interest inChina will tend to free the hands of Japan.We cannot assess where the balance of advantage. lies.(f) If Russia wore openly, hos tile, sub marine..warfarewould probably be intensified.in home waters *.More determined action by German surfacevessels would have to be expected and the.availability of the ice-free port of Murmanskwould broaden the base of the enemy!soperationso    A minor threat to British trade might develop in the Pacific.(g) Partly because of the slowing up of our economic pressure, and partly in consequence of thedispersion of our strength in secondary theatres,the date when the Allies could pass to the offensive on land and in the air would probablybe postponedo

(h) A partnership between Nazi Germany andBolshevik Russia must, however, be an uneasyone.    Contact with the Russian Armies and thedisqptietihg effect of the Russo-Germanrapprochement will increase the chances of an internal break up in Germany, especially if shesuffers any military reverses.(Signed) E.E.C.
