THE SITUATION REACHED IF THE SINO-JAPAFESE HOSTILITIES ON 25th SEPTEMBER?  1959, ANDESTIMATE OF CHINEFE CAPACITY FOR RESISTANCEaDuration of War-.1. Sino-Japanese hostilities have now &quot;been in progress for 2 years 5 months.      This in itself is an indication of thefailure of japan&apos;s original plan which envisaged a quick war.Japanese Progress and Control.2. The Japanese forces have overrun approximately a quarter of China proper- and are in control of all the majorports.      Owing to the activities of Chinese guerilla forcesJapanese control is limited to certain centres and to lines ofcommunication;    Chinese irregulars continue to take considerabletoll of the Japanese garrison posts (Japanese casualties withinthe occupied territories of North China alone are at present about 10,000 a month).In -addition, the Chinese Armies remain in the field.Present Japanese Operations.5. Large-scale military operations by the Japanese forcesin China ceased temporarily in May this year with the failureof their attempted drive north-west of Hankow,      offensive operations are now reported to have recommenced in centralChina and&apos;Japanese troops are stated to be converging onChangsha (capital of Hunan) from the north and east,      no progress reports have yet been received,,

Japanese Inten.tione.....aj^^Prosngjrbs^40 Japanese intentions are net, clear, but it is possiblethat the Japanese Army is making a further attempt to finishthe &quot;China affairi! by military action,    it is considereddoubtful, however., whether such successes as the JapaneseArmy can achieve would contribute materially towardsrealising her aims in China which remain primarily economic.For this her chief requirement is time in which to consolidatein the territory already gained,,The. Morale factor minister: Chinese ,Reslstano;do5, The main factor affecting China&apos;s capacity for resistance-tance is morale,,    Up to the present this has remainedsurprisingly good.    It should be remembered however thatChinese morale is sustained mainly by propaganda emanating from Chungking,  the seat of the Government,  and that morale inChungking,  is,  in turn, to a great extent dependent on thesupport afforded by foreign Powers - particularly the more powerful democracies.    Chinese morale Is reported, to havebeen affected, at -least to some extent, by the agreement reached by the British and Japanese representatives in theirpreliminary discussions prior to the recent Tokyo conversations.The outbreak of war in Europe has also tended to foster a feeling of isolation in Chinese government circ ii..esc    It islikely that this feeling will be increased, by recent developments in the Russian attitude towards Japan0Supply of War - Material tot.China.,60 The supply of war material to China. Is now confined toany aircraft and munitions which may be furnished by SovietRussia and. despatched overland.,,  and supplies entering south-west China through Haiphong (Indo China) or along the Burma-Ynnan road (limited capacity, but open all weathers)*    There

is probably sufficient war material in China at the moment for present scale hostilities to continue for about 9 months.Minor arsenals manufacture small arms - and, in some cases,light machine guns - and their output should be sufficient for guerilla warfare to be maintained for an indefiniteperiodsChinese Capacity for Resistancea7e To sum up, there are at present no grounds for believing that Chinese military resistance is likely to collapse^(ii) WHETHER, FROM THE PURELY MILITARY POINT OFVIEW,  IT IS TO OUR ADVANTAGE THAT SINO-JAPANESEHOSTILITIES SHOULD CONTINUE OR CEASEo8.. We have always recognised the danger of becomingembroiled with a first class power in the Far East when weare at war with germany     Moreover so long as the neutrality of Italy is not definitely assured, a possible extension ofthe war to the Far East must be prevented by any means inour powere     Any circumstances, therefore, which preventJapan turning the whole weight of her military effort against us are to our advantage09* The China commitment is a serious embarrassment to japan from the economic as well as from the Army point ofview, since large-scale military operations overseas inevitablybring a heavy strain on a country&apos;s economic structure0Japan&apos;s requirements of imported raw materials have greatlyincreased, while she has lost many of her export markets and much of the income from shipping which she needs to pay forher importse     Moreover, the maintenance of a big army in theField involves not only direct financial expenditure on alarge scale, but also the withdrawal of large numbers of menfrom productive work in industry and agricultures

On. the other hand, the Japanese Fleet is hardlyengaged; there are considerable air- forces surplus to japanese requirements in China;    and there are alsosufficient troops available to undertake operations against our outposts in the Far Easto10s       The fact remains however that so long as Japan hasthis commitment in China, she is unable to concentrate onus, and the continued drain on her economic resources mustreact on her capacity to wage war in the future against a major power0llo       On the other hand, so long as the conflict proceeds,the greatest care will be needed lest the Japanese, whoattribute Chinese resistance partly to our backing, becomeexasperated to the point of provoking hostilities at a timewhen our embarrassments elsewhere must seriously prejudice our capacity to defend our interests in the Far Easto     Theextent of this danger must depend to some degree on theattitude of the United States of America,,Apart from this consideration, from the military point of view, the prolongation of the war is to ouradvantageo(Signed)      C.L0N, NSWALLcDUDLEY POUND.EDMUND IRONS IDE otonond Terrace, S*W41028th September, 1939c
