At their 307th Meeting, held on 20th January, 1938, the Committee ofImperial Defence had under consideration a most secret summary of the positionof gas warfare in Germany. The Chairman thought it &quot; desirable that we shouldtake stock of our own position with a view to see how far our preparations were adequate,&quot; and the Committee agreed : &quot;(a) that the Service Departments should prepare memoranda for theinformation of the Committee of Imperial Defence, showing in some detail the present position as regards (i) Defensive arrangements to meet gas attack.(ii) Arrangements to use gas offensively, in case we were compelled todo so in retaliation,(hi) Arrangements for the use of incendiary bombs, etc., etc.&quot;These memoranda were to be forwarded to the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence.2. On receipt of these memoranda, the Minister for Co-ordination, requested the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in the first instance to examine theReports and to advise on the following points (a) Whether the position in regard to preparations for Chemical Warfare asrevealed by the Reports can be regarded as generally satisfactory.Jfi) Whether the Reports revealed shortcomings in our preparations in any marked resuects.3. The Deputy Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee considered the memoranda attheir meeting on 28th July, 1939.4 In considering the question of deficiencies in the arrangements for the offensive use of gas, they recalled the decision that the War Office should beresponsible for the supply of mustard gas for both the army and the R.A.F. andfor charging it into weapons, and that provision of mustard gas should bemade by the establishment of three new factories. In the interests of convenienceas well as economy, as opposed to considerations of vulnerability, it had beensubsequently agreed that supply should be shared equally between two new;factories instead of three.5. These two factories provided a manufacturing capacity of 90 tons a weeknow in operation, capacity for a further 130 tons a week by November, 1939,and a final 90 tons a week by April, 1940 a total of 310 tons a week. Recentexpansions of the Army and R.A.F., however, had led to increased requirementsof mustard gas for both Services, the total combined figure of requirements nowbeing 870 tons a week.
6. The Sub-Committee accordingly recommended -; &quot;That the construction of an additional factory for the manufactureof mustard gas with a capacity of at least 300 tons per week should be sanctioned and that at the same time the question of how much furthermanufacturing and bulk storage capacity is needed should be investigated.&quot;7- The Sub-Committee stressed the need for holding reserves of filled gasweapons, even when manufacturing and bulk storage capacity is adequate to meet all requirements, in order to have means immediately available for retaliation;and in view of the fact that it had now been found possible to store filled con-tainers without danger of deterioration they recommended &quot; That both the War Office and the Air Ministry should be authorized tostore a reserve of filled gas weapons in peace time.&quot;, ...8. The Sub-Committee also recommended-&quot; That the Departmental Memoranda under consideration (see para. above) should be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence after those:     by the Service Departments have been brought up-to-date and that theWar Office and Air Ministry should review the requirements laid down in1936 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1465-B).&quot;9. The Sub-Committee \s report would in normal circumstances have been circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence ; but in view of the international situation, consideration by that Committee became impracticable, and it wasdecided that the matter should be discussed interdepartmentally between theTreasury, the Home Office, the Service Departments and the Ministry of Supply.10. Two meetings have accordingly been held to review the position. Thesecond meeting was attended by representatives of the Admiralty, Air Ministry,Treasury, Home Office and Ministry of Supply..     The main conclusions resulting from the meetings were as follows : (a) The additional 300 tons a week plant recommended by the Deputy... Chiefs of. Staff (see paragraph 6 above) will cover only 50 per cent, ofthe quantity of mustard gas which detailed investigation shows to benecessary for the Army and Air Force by September, 1940.(b) The Army requirements in Phosgene are likely to be in the nature of 80to 100 tons a week and are additional to its requirements in mustard,,,, gas.       &apos;. - ;/-. -(c) The present 5  tons a week B.B.C. (lachrymatory) plant is quiteinsufficient for Army requirements.11. The erection of plant for the manufacture of mustard gas takes aconsiderable time and, if sanction for a new factory for 300 tons capacity is obtained now, it is improbable that more than 400 tons a week, including the310 tons already approved, can be produced by September, 1940, and 600 tonsa week by March, 1941, as compared with the minimum requirements of thetwo Services at September, 1940, of 1,200 tons a week. If, therefore, provision is to be made to enable adequate action to be taken should the German Governmentresort to the use of poison gas, it is of the utmost importance that sanction shouldbe obtained now for the erection not only of the factory recommended by the deputy Chiefs of Staff, but also of a factory on a site to be selected to increaseexisting capacity to the minimum requirements of 1,200 tons a week referred toabove. Otherwise production will lag far behind requirements throughout thewar.12. The Army requirements in Phosgene must be regarded as additional tothe above requirements in mustard gas and in addition to the erection of thenecessary plant for the manufacture of Phosgene, orders should be placed&apos;how forthe Livens drums and cylinders in which the Phosgene will be used.
13- We should, therefore, be glad if an immediate decision may be givenwhether provision may be made on the basis recommended by the interdepart-mental conference, namely : (a) Mustard gas Plant to increase production from 310 tons (which hasalready been approved) to 1,200 tons a week.The cost of plant for 900 tons of mustard gas a week includingcharging plant, storage of gas weapons, etc., and the plant for producingthe necessary intermediates is estimated at  8,000,000.(6) Non-persistent gas 100 tons a week Phosgene plant and the Livensand cylinders required for use with this gas.The cost of plant for 100 tons of Phosgene a week is estimatedat  600,000.(c) Lachrymatory Gas Plant to increase production of B.B.C. from 5 tons a(which has already been approved) to 30 tons a week.The cost of this increase is estimated at  200,000.L.
