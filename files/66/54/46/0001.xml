(2)Mr. Eden to Sir A. Clark Kerr (Moscow).Foreign Office, 3rd September, 1944.(No. 198 Citizen.)(Telegraphic.)(fop Secret.)Your telegram No. 42 Citizen (of 31st August: Roumanian Armistice).Following are our comments : Title and Preamble.(a) The Armistice should cover all the United Nations Governments at warwith Roumania. We assume Soviet Government have this in mind. We, in anycase, must have time to consult and seek concurrence of the Dominions.(&amp;) Signature by political representatives on Allied side will raise difficulties with the Dominions and other Allied Governments who will all wish to sign-Best way of avoiding this is for the Armistice to be signed on the Allied side by one military representative. His Maiesty&apos;s Government will be glad toauthorise a Soviet general to sign on their behalf. Please inform Soviet Govern-nient and ask whether they agree with this procedure which would follow Italian *precedent.  We are confident that Dominion Governments will agree.(c) Final wording of preamble will depend on decision as regards (&amp;).Article 1.We think explicit provisions should be made for disarming and interningenemy troops and nationals in Roumania.Article 4.(a) First sentence. After &quot;return&quot; add &quot;if desired.&quot; Reason for thisaddition is that many British subjects interned in Roumania may not wish toreturn to this country, and we must not give Roumanian Government pretext to deport them.(b) Second sentence.   After &quot;citizens&quot; add &quot;and displaced persons andrefugees.&quot;Article 5.Delete last eight words, and substitute &quot; or because of their race, and willrepeal all discriminatory legislation and restrictions imposed thereunder.&quot;Article 6.What do the Russians mean by war material ? In our view it should hereinclude all material or equipment belonging to, used by, or intended for use by[28145] b 215. Roumanian civil administration is restored in the whole area of roumania separated by not less than 50-100 kilometres (depending on geo-graphical conditions) from the front line, Roumanian administrative bodiesundertake to carry out instructions and orders issued by the Allied (Soviet) high command for the purpose of securing the execution of these armistice terms.16. An Allied Control Commission will be established which will undertake the regulation of and control over the execution of present terms under the general direction and instructions of Allied (Soviet) High Command.17, Allied Governments consider decision of Vienna Award incorrect [sic]and agree that Transylvania (whole or greater part) should be plainly Roumaniansubject to reconsideration at the Peace settlement.18. Present terms come into force at the moment of their signing and will operate until conclusion of a final peace between the U.S.S.R., United Kingdomand United States of America on the one hand and Roumania on the other hand.Done in Moscow in four copies each in Russian, English and Roumanianlanguages, all four texts being authentic.Date 1944.On behalf of Governments of U.S.S.R., United Kingdom and United Statesof America.On behalf of Governments and High Command of Roumania.
enemy military or para-military formations and members thereof in connexionwith their operations. We do not think it should cover all enemy property (e.g.,a German-owned factory in Roumania). We consider that separate provision should be included specifying that enemy property (other than war material)should be held at the disposal of the United Nations.Article 7. - -(a) The Roumanian Government are not concerned with the use and disposalof United Nations ships after they have been handed over, and the first para-graph of this article should accordingly stop at &quot;may be.&quot; This does not mean that we waive any right or claim we have to British ships; on the contrary,we consider that all Allied ships should at once revert to their owners. We agreethat the Soviet Government should have temporary use of these ships &quot; in thegeneral interests of the Allies,&quot; but the terms and duration of such use will bematters for discussion between the Soviet Government and the Allied Govern -ments concerned.(b) Line 2 : after &quot; belonging &quot; add &quot; or having belonged.&quot;Article 8.We assume that where enterprises, installations, &amp;c, are United Nationsproperty, instructions will only be given after consultation, so far as this ispossible, with the United Nations Government concerned.Article 9.This is contrary to our policy as set out in my telegram 193 Citizen. We donot think that it is possible at this stage to fix final figure and the article onlyrefers to Soviet claims.   We suggest following redraft :-&quot; The Roumanian Government will comply with such provisions as theAllied (Soviet) High Command may prescribe regarding restitution,deliveries, services or payment by way of reparation. In fixing the amountof reparation account will be taken of the fact that Roumania has not merelywithdrawn from the war, but has declared war and in fact waged war againstGermany and Hungary.&quot; The first sentence is lifted textually from theItalian Armistice, in which Soviet Government concurred.Article 10.Please confirm that this refers only to identifiable objects. We want to be certain about this, as this article will create an important precedent for restitutionvis-a-vis other enemy countries.Article 11.We suggest the following redraft: &quot;The Roumanian Government under-takes to restore in complete good order property, rights and interests located inRoumanian territory of the United Nations and their citizens.&quot;Article 12.We should like this article to start &quot;Roumania will deliver commodities. . . .&quot; and to make good the omission by adding the following additionalarticle : &quot; The Roumanian Government will make available such Roumaniancurrency as the Allied (Soviet) High Command may require. Roumanian-Government will withdraw and redeem in Roumanian currency within such time limits and on such terms as the Allied (Soviet) High Command may specify all holdings in Roumanian territory of currencies issued by the Allied(Soviet) High Command, and will hand over the currency so withdrawn free of cost to the Allied (Soviet) High Command.&quot; If, however, the SovietGovernment object you can accept Article 12 in its present form, provided thewords &quot; local currency &quot; are added after &quot; services &quot; in the sentence we wishto acid to Article 16 (see below).Article 15.Omit words &quot;issued by the Allied (Soviet) High Command,&quot; and add atthe end of the article &quot;of facilitating the work of such missions as the Alliesmay send and meeting Allied requirements for the re-establishment of peace and security.&quot;
Article 16.(a) Add the following sentence &quot; Roumanian Government will furnish itfree of charge with all the facilities, supplies and services it may require.&quot;(b) Please confirm that powers conferred under numerous articles on Allied(Soviet) High Command will, in fact, be implemented through Allied control commission.Article 17.You should suggest, but need not press, that contents of this article mightmore suitably be couched in form of a separate declaration. In any case, wewould like wording to conform to my telegram No. 192 Citizen.Article 18.(a) Our comments on the preamble apply here also.(b) We consider there should only be two authentic texts: Russian and english.We have following further additional comments : (a) There is no longer any reference to the independence and sovereignty of roumania.  Can you explain this ?(b) There is no mention of the Roumanian navy and merchant fleet. Wethink it essential that the Armistice should provide for the operational control bythe Allies of all Roumanian ships whether in Roumanian or foreign waters foruse in the general interest of the Allies, as was clone in the case of Italy. Por your own information, two Roumanian liners now at Istanbul (Constantinople) are ofconsiderable importance. Way in which these ships should be used and their ultimate disposal would be matters for discussion and settlement between theAllies.(c) We think a denunciatory article is required.(d) We suggest additional article similar to Article 11 of BulgarianArmistice.(f?) There is no mention of the Danube. We therefore suggest adding some such provision as &apos;&apos; The Roumanian Government will comply with Allied instructions for thecontrol of navigation on the Danube and connected transport facilities.&quot;(/) It is very desirable that Roumania should sever all relations with Japan.We recognise that it may be difficult to include this in the Armistice itself, but you should ask Soviet Government whether they agree that an instruction tothis effect should immediately be issued to the Roumanian Government underArticle io.
