THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.secret. Copy No.W.P. (44) 475.27th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.ARMISTICE TERMS FOR BULGARIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate, for the information of the War Cabinet, a report, whichI asked Sir William Strang to write, on the preparation of the draft armistice terms for Bulgaria by the European Advisory Commission.A. E.Foreign Office, 27th August, 1944.Report by the United Kingdom Representative on theEuropean Advisory Commission.IT was agreed some weeks ago between the United Kingdom, United Statesand Soviet Governments that Armistice terms for Bulgaria should be worked out by the European Advisory Commission. The British proposals, on lines approved by the Armistice and Post-War Committee, were circulated to theCommission on the 26th July. Proposals by the United States Delegation on similar lines were circulated on the same clay. In spite of repeated inquiries byMr. Winant and myself, it was not until the 24th August that the soviet representative was in a position to start discussions. The United States and united Kingdom Delegations had, however, meanwhile harmonised theirrespective proposals and were able to enter upon discussions in the commission with substantially identical views. Meetings of the Commission were held onthe 24th and 25th August as a result of which a draft of Armistice terms forBulgaria was recommended by the United Kingdom and United states representatives to their respective Governments (see Annex). The soviet representatives promised to state the view of his Government as soon as possible,but said he would not be able to do so before Monday, the 28th August.2. During the discussions the Soviet representative urged (1) that weshould draft an Armistice and not an instrument of unconditional surrender;(2) that the terms should not be so stringent as to make it unlikely that Bulgariawould accept them, in view of the political and military importance of gettingBulgaria out of the war as soon as possible; (3) in particular, that provision should be made not for the military occupation of Bulgaria, but merely, on the precedent of the proposals made by the Soviet Government for Roumania, forliberty to move forces across Bulgarian territory if the military situationrequired. In the draft as it left the Commission some account has been taken ofthe Soviet views. The Article dealing with the entry of Allied forces intoBulgaria (Article 4), which goes somewhat further than the Soviet proposal, isbased on suggestions made by the Vice-Chiefs of Staff.3. Meanwhile, approaches from the Bulgarian Government had made thepreparation of terms a matter of urgency. On the 16th August His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Ankara received M. Moshanov, ex-Speaker of the BulgarianParliament, who inquired at the instance of the Bulgarian Government on whatterms Bulgaria could come out of the war. M. Moshanov did, however, suggestthat it would be better for Bulgaria to wait until after the completion of the harvest before taking a definite step. On the 23rd August, however, HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador received a further and more pressing message fromM. Moshanov at Istanbul saying that he was authorised to treat and asking thatcontact should be ro-established as quickly as possible. His Majesty&apos;s AmbassadorAvas instructed on the 25th August to ask M. Moshanov to go to Cairo to meet[28098]
Lord Moyne and the United States Representative. On the 26th August thedraft terms recommended by the European Advisory Commission were sent toLord Moyne, who was instructed to hold them until his United States colleaguereceived instructions to concert with him in presenting them to M. Moshanov,and until it could be decided whether the formal concurrence of the SovietGovernment should be awaited or not. The Soviet Union is not, of course, at warwith Bulgaria.4. It now appears that M. Moshanov has temporarily returned to Sofia,leaving in Istanbul, however, aM. Kisselov, who is equally empowered to treaton behalf of the Bulgarian Government. In the circumstances, His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Turkey has been instructed to arrange for M. Kisselov&apos;s immediate departure for Cairo, to be followed by M. Moshanov as soon as hereturns.5. Meanwhile, further examination in London of the draft termsrecommended by the Commission has shown that it would be safer from thefinancial point of view if one or two of the articles could be made somewhatmore explicit. At the suggestion of the Treasury the amendments underlinedin the Annex have been put to the United States Government for their considera-tion. They have been discussed with Mr. Winant who has agreed to recommendthem to Washington.(Signed) W.
