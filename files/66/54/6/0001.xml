(44) 45622nd August, 1944WAR CABINETREHABILITATION OF RETURNED PRISONERS OF war memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR war at the end of the war with Germany, we shall be faced with the problem ofrehabilitating a considerable proportion of the 100,000 or so British prisoners in german hands; when the Japanese war ends, we shall have the same problem as concerns about half that number of British prisoners held by the Japanese, a much greater percentageof whom will, however, stand in need of rehabilitation treatment.There are, broadly speaking, two aspects of the problem. First, a considerable proportion of the British prisoners of war treed from German prison camps will be menin the younger age groups who will, after a due interval of leave, re-training, etc., takea further part in the war against Japan. Secondly, a considerable number of theBritish prisoners in Germany will be eligible for release from the Service at the end ofthe German war, under the normal age and service rules governing release.As concerns the first category, rehabilitation will form part of the process of re-training the soldier to make him an effective fighting man against the Japanese: andas such it is, in any case, an Army responsibility. It is with the ex-prisoners of war who are eligible for release on their return to this country that the policy line is not soclear; for these men will not represent a continuing asset to Service manpower, and willdesire their release from the Army at the earliest possible date.After the 1914/18 war, the Service Departments did not assume any responsibilityfor rehabilitating ex-prisoners of war. That policy was, however, the subject of a gooddeal of criticism at the time, and public opinion to-day expects from the Governmentconsiderably more in the way of shouldering after-care responsibilities in respect ofService personnel than it did a generation ago. Further, the conditions in Germanprison camps, and emphatically in Japanese prison camps, during the present war, havebeen such as to do considerably more mental harm to prisoners than in the last war.When the first batch of prisoners of war returned recently to this country and were discharged from the Service, a number urged that steps should be taken by the Army torehabilitate them for return to civil life. My Department, in conjunction with the other service Departments and the Ministry of Labour, have, therefore, given some con-sideration to the problem; but it is clear that the Ministry of Labour are unable to assistbeyond establishing a small experimental rehabilitation centre for the training and resettlement of disabled persons: not more than about 250 cases can be dealt with atthis centre.I think that there will be a considerable public demand that the Government should undertake the task of correcting, so far as possible, those special psychological disabilitieswhich inevitably arise from prolonged captivity in enemy hands, and I consider that theresponsibility for this work should be undertaken by the Service Departments; I under-stand that the Admiralty and the Air Ministry share this view.   It is difficult to giveeven an approximate estimate of the numbers of men who may be in need of treatment to restore their mental balance and outlook when released from the prison camps; buta very rough computation gives an estimate of the order of 35,000 needing mentalrehabilitation during the 12 months following the defeat of Germany, and willing to stay in the Army for the period necessary to undergo rehabilitation treatment.   It isclear that we should neither desire, nor be able, to compel men who would otherwise be eligible for release from the Service to undertake such treatment, and it may well bethat large numbers will not be so willing: my estimate above is based on about one-halfol the releasablc ex-prisoners of war desiring to have rehabilitation treatment-Copy-No.
The kind of treatment I have in mind would be of the nature of lectures, films,discussions and so on, designed mainly to bring the ex-prisoner of war up to date with current affairs and problems, together with an element of physical rehabilitation bygames, physical training, etc.; the length of the course might vary from 6 weeks for themore tractable cases to 3 months for the more severe.It may be urged that these rehabilitation plans should be applied equally to those&quot; broken in the wars &quot;. But the case of the prisoner of war is a special one: hisdisability is a psychological one of a peculiar kind, for which the Army is in the best position to give the prompt, simple treatment that is required. The other cases are toa greater extent covered by the existing machinery, and are not so readily dealt withas a special group.I am therefore instructing my Department to plan rehabilitation courses for ex-prisoners of war on the lines I have indicated broadly above, and to consult with theuther Service Departments and the civilian Ministries concerned in the framing of thoseplans, so as to ensure not only a common policy among the Service Departments, butalso the necessary integration of the treatment provided by the Services in this connec-tion with the measures undertaken by the Ministries of Labour, Health, Pensions andothers, to assist the ex-Serviceman on his return to civil life. As, however, the matter is of considerable general and political interest, I think my colleagues will like to know what I am proposing.PJ.G.The War Office,2.2nd August, 1944.(1344/188)   85   8/44   w.c.p.   18832
