THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 473.26th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.Civil Air Transport.THE INTERNATIONAL POSITION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE telegrams from the Lord Privy Seal about his recent conversations withMr. Berle* show that we have reached a critical stage in the negotiations for thepost-war ordering of international civil air transport.The announced policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. Following the talks with Mr. Berle which took place in London in april last, the Lord Privy Seal made a statement in the House of Lords on the 10th May.As he then explained, it was agreed that we and the Americans should go forward to an international conference on the basis of the proposals for the internationalhandling of civil aviation, which had been agreed at the Commonwealthconversations some six months previously. The broad purpose would be &quot;to draw up an international convention on air navigation, to be implemented by anInternational Transport Organisation, which would evolve standards, seek to eliminate uneconomic competition, work out for each nation an equitableparticipation in world air transport and maintain broad equilibrium between air transport capacity and traffic offering. On these general principles, the UnitedStates and Great Britain are in agreement.&quot;Later in the same speech the Lord Privy Seal stressed that the foundations of any enlightened approach to the subject of international air transport were(i) the elimination of uneconomic competition; (ii) the setting up of nationalquotas in international air transport; and (iii) equilibrum between the trafficcapacity and the traffic offering on international air routes.3. This is the latest but not by any means the only pronouncement of theGovernment&apos;s view that international collaboration is essential &apos;&apos; if the air isto be developed in the interests of mankind as a whole, trade served, internationalunderstanding fostered and some measure of international security gained.&quot;(Vide Government statements in both Houses of Parliament on 11th March. 1943.)Mr. Berle&apos;s Latest Proposals.4. The policy which Mr. Berle has now put forward and to which he isseeking our adherence is radically different. The failure of his talks with theDominions, the Dutch and other nations has convinced him that international regulation is the policy uppermost in the minds of the small nations that they,at any rate, agree with us. The aspirations of the American airlines, however,run counter to any form of international control. In these circumstancesMr. Berle appears to have reached the conclusion (a) that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing bilateral conversations on the lines of those alreadyheld; and (6) that the United States of America should launch out at once intowhat he calls post-armistice civil aviation, i.e., should acquire operating rights,in the first instance, in Spain, and should then move out on to the other air routesthroughout the world as facilities can be secured. He invites us to keep in step with him in this policy. An international conference might be held later on&quot; to review the position and straighten out any difficult points.&quot;* Nor. 4197 from Washington and 411 and -112 from New York :  also circulated as c.A.T.

American Approach for Facilities.5. Two further telegrams have now come in from the Embassy in washington which are reproduced as Appendices I and II. The latter elatedAugust 15th is particularly important. It shows that the Americans havenot thought fit to wait for our comments the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s telegram circu-lated on the 12th August was our first intimation that comments from Londonwere required-and have despatched instructions to their Missions abroad to approach the Governments concerned for facilities. It is understood that theUnited Kingdom Government will be one of the Governments to be approached.The position now reached.6. The situation is now serious. It&quot; was clear from, the London talks withMr. Berle that the proposal for an International Authority with executive powers was not likely to be acceptable to the Americans. What they wanted wasto secure Freedoms I and II (the right of transit and the right to land for non-traffic purposes) and to make as few concessions as possible in return. they accordingly tried by bilateral negotiations to secure the support of other nations for their views, so that they could press them at an international conference with good prospects of success. Having failed in this attempt, the)&apos; have abandoned the idea of an international conference at which broad policy would be discussed and are unashamedly trying to secure the facilities they want through bilateralbargaining, no doubt baiting their hook with the offer of transport aircraft. Ifthey succeed, any hope of orderly development in the field of post-war civil air transport will have vanished, and none of the principles which we have declared to be the foundation of any enlightened approach to the subject (see paragraph above) will&apos;have been achieved.The courses open to us.7. The Americans have beaten the gun and we must act quickly. Twocourses are-open to us :-(a) to inform the Americans that we agree with the action they have taken and that we propose to do likewise this is what Mr. Berle hopes; or(b) to make it clear that we do not agree; that, in our view, the action theyhave taken is inconsistent with the conclusions of the London con-ference; that we adhere to the plan agreed at the Commonwealthconversations; that, if the Americans are unwilling to take theinitiative in summoning an international conference on the basis ofthat plan, as they agreed to do during the London talks, we.shall doso ourselves: and that meanwhile we shall feel obliged to make ourposition clear to our own public and to the world.8. It is unnecessary for me to recapitulate the arguments in favour of thepolicy we have already put forward. It has been endorsed by the C.A.T. Com-mittee and by the War Cabinet and accepted by the Dominions.The importance of transport aircraft.9. The biggest card held by the Americans is transport aircraft. If weannounce that we stick to our principles, the Americans, knowing that most of thenations represented at an international conference would probably support us,will do their best to win them away by threatening to withhold aircraft. This is,however, a dangerous game for the Americans to play and depends for its successentirely on the continued inability of this country to meet the aircraft require-ments of those nations whose attitude to international co-operation is the same asours. If we can assure our friends that we can before long meet their require-ments, with converted types, perhaps, in the first instance, but in due coursewith new types as good as those produced in America and cheaper, our position will be very strong.   It is clear that the American menace fills them with alarm.10. Thus, the crux of the matter is the production of transport aircraft inthis country. The Minister of Aircraft Production and I have from time to timeconsidered what more could be clone by, e.g., the recruitment of more designers, to expedite the production of our new Brabazon types, and approval was recentlygiven by the War Cabinet to certain proposals which he put forward. The time has now come for more drastic action. The war in Europe and the Far East isstill very much with us, but we cannot indefinitely accept a position which allows
the Americans apparently with the acquiescence of their Chiefs of Staff to devote resources to post-war objectives while we concentrate exclusively on thewar. I hope that the Minister of Aircraft Production and I will shortly be in aposition to bring forward new proposals. Additional resources will almost certainly be needed.11. If, as I trust, we can speed up the production of converted types suchas the York, the Tudor, and the Avro XXI and the design and production ^ ofthe Brabazon types, our position will be much strengthened. The danger period will be the next two or three years. Already the Dutch and the Belgians have indicated that, provided our new civil types are available without undue delay,they will accept converted types to cover the interim period. Other nations maywell follow suit.The strength of our position.12. Accordingly, if we can offer delivery of good transport aircraft, thevarious nations (the U.S.S.R. possibly excepted) may well be ready to range them-selves with us and to resist American blandishments. If this happens, the positionof the United States of America will not be happy. Her prospects of obtainingoperating rights in exchange for aircraft by bilateral agreement will have receded,since she will be negotiating not with individual countries but with an Inter-national Authority. And the bases controlled by the nations represented on theAuthority will be world-wide and strategically placed. In fact, it might not belong before the United States of America would be obliged to join in.Possible objections.13. Are there then any drawbacks to the policy of standing firm on theconclusions of the Commonwealth conversations ? It may be argued that theAmerican position vis-a-vis ourselves is generally so strong that we cannot afford to pursue a line of action opposed to theirs and that the course of prudence is to fall in with them while the going is good rather than be coerced later when wehave lost their goodwill.   My reply to this is as follows :  (a) We and the other nations who may be expected to side with us have atrump card in our hands in the form of bases. The Americans realisethis and the haste which they are making is an indication of theiranxiety to make the maximum use of a fleeting opportunity.(b) In many other fields of economic activity, we may have no alternative but to bow the knee to Washington. If we were to abandon ourposition in the field of air transport when it is manifestly in our long-term interest and in the interests of the peace of the world that weshould adhere to our plan we could hardly expect to hold our ownanywhere. Moreover, the other nations would feel that they hadbeen betrayed. Finally, the Government would have to explain toParliament and the country, as well as to the Dominions, why we had changed our policy in such, a vital and sensitive matter as the exploitation of the air.   This would not be easy.A merican plans for commercial expansion.14. There is a further point. Mr. Berle has said that he must satisfy&quot; the long queues waiting to be transported &quot; and that accordingly he intends to &quot; move out for traffic.&quot; Mr. Berle does not specify what types of passengermake up the long queues or why they should be transported across the world by air in the middle of a world war. The usual response of Washington when wehave asked them to agree to projects of our own, projects with a direct warpurpose, has been that they constitute an unwarranted diversion from the war effort. This must be our answer now to Mr. BerkVs present proposals. We cannotallow the Americans to start a commercial race when our resources are, or shouldbe, devoted to the speedy termination of the war.Summary.15. To sum up, the issues are grave and the time has come to take a firm line.I recommend that Mr. Berle should be told in plain terms :  (a) that we stand firm on the line agreed at the Commonwealth conversations,i.e., on the Balfour Report;
(b) that, in our view, an international conference should be held as soonas possible at which we, for our part, will table the proposals inthat Report;(c) that if the Americans will not take the initiative in summoning theConference, we will; and(d) that at a time when resources should be concentrated on the prosecution of the war, w-e cannot agree to the widespread development ofcommercial air services.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, 26th August, 1944.APPENDIX I.From Washington to Foreign Office.(No. 4361.) 13th August, 1944.In the absence of Berle, Morgan, Head of Civil Aviation Division of state department, informed member of my staff that Berle had been assured byBeaverbrook that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have no objection to theUnited States Government going ahead with bilateral negotiations for landingrights along certain routes indicated in Civil Aeronautics Board&apos;s announcement(my telegram No. 3196).  State Department accordingly proposed to go ahead.2. Member of my staff said he thought it unlikely that Beaverbrook wouldhave felt able to give this assurance without confirmation from London, andMr. Masefield subsequently confirmed that this was correct. Morgan has therefore decided to suspend action for a few days since he did not wish, in the absenceof Berle, to go ahead and risk an intimation from His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat they after all did not agree.3. Morgan, however, urged member of my staff to secure the earliest possiblestatement of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this point, since pressure on state department from all directions to start negotiations was extremely strong.4. I understand that Beaverbrook has been in touch with Berle personallyon this point and above is reported for record. May I have very early instructions as to what should be said to State Department ?APPENDIX II.From Washington to Foreign Office.(No. 4393.) 15th August, 1944.My telegram No. 4361.State Department now inform me that as no comment has been received fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government since Lord Beaverbrook was informed on 3rd Augustthat the United States wished to go ahead with bilateral negotiations for landingrights, they propose to send off by air mail to-day instructions to various UnitedStates Missions abroad to approach the Governments concerned. I understandthat this will include approach to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom.2: Further pressure appears to have been put on the State Department sincedespatch of my telegram under reference.
