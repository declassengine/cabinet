THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 480.30th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.Copy No.  o t)FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL AVIATION.Note by the Prime Minister.SINCE this matter was discussed in the War Cabinet on the 20th June,minutes have been addressed to me on the subject by the Lord Privy Seal and theSecretary of State for Air.   Copies of these two minutes are annexed.2. I agree with the proposals in the Lord Privy SeaEs minute. I am willing that an additional Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Air Ministry shouldbe created in order to deal exclusively with civil aviation while it remains underthe authority of the Air Ministry.3. At the close of the war the control of civil aviation should pass to theMinistry of Transport.w. s. c.10 Doivnina Street, S.W.1,&apos;30th&apos;August, 1944.ANNEX I.Prime Minister,AT a meeting of the C.A.T. Committee on the 17th July, the Secretary ofState for Air being absent, I was unanimously authorised to address to you thefollowing minute : When the C.A.T. Committee wras set up, its duties were defined by the WarCabinet as (1) To assume responsibility for discussions on civil aviation with theDominions and for a subsequent International Conference.(2) To review, in consultation with the Machinery of Government Committee,the Departmental Organisation and Ministerial responsibility for post-war civil aviation matters and to recommend whether any changes should be made before hostilities cease.[28105]
These tasks have been accomplished.Discussions with the Dominions have taken place and resulted in a wide measure of agreement.Preliminary discussions in relation to an International Conference have beenheld with the Americans. It is, however, certain that considerable time willelapse before this Conference can take place.The C.A.T. Committee has 7-ecommended by a majority vote that civil aviationbe transferred to the Ministry of Transport after the war.The Machinery of Government Committee has concurred in this recommenda-tion, which is, however, opposed by the Secretary of State for Air.The Machinery of Government Committee has recommended that the respon-sibility for the war-time planning of civil aviation for the post-war period shouldbe determined by the War Cabinet.The C.A.T. Committee, having fulfilled the purposes for which it was created, should now therefore be wound up. It is my further recommendation that the War Cabinet should decide to restore that responsibility for the wholeheld of civil aviation for the duration of the war to the Secretary of State for Air.B.ldth July. 1944.ANNEX II.Prime Minister.Civil Aviation.iYou have received a minute from the Lord Privy Seal recommending that (i) responsibility for civil aviation as a whole should be restored, for the duration of the war, to the Secretary of State for Air, with whomconstitutionally it has always rested;(ii) the C.A.T. Committee should be wound up.This minute was unanimously endorsed by the C.A.T. Committee at a meeting which I was prevented by indisposition from attending.I do not dissent from the recommendations, but there are one or two commentswhich I wish to make.Tf the recommendations are approved, it will be necessary, sooner or later, tomake a statement in Parliament, for both Houses have been told that the lord privy Seal is the co-coordinator of the Governments post-war policy in the inter-national field and both Houses know of the existence of the C.A.T. Committee.With so many issues of civil air policy still undecided the War Cabinet havemy proposals before them and with so much still to be done in the internationalfield, such an announcement by itself would be hailed by our critics as a furtherdisplay of dilatoriness on the part of the Government. If the announcement isto be well received, it must include positive evidence that we mean business.
We should, I think, satisfy Parliament, at any rate for the time being, if wewere in a position to say (a) that an additional Parliamentary Under-Secretary was being appointedto the Air Ministry who would devote his whole time to civil aviation;(This is the solution which the Minister of Labour advocatedwhen the Cabinet last discussed this subject.)(b) that we had reached a decision that B.O.A.C. was to remain the singlechosen instrument for the development of our overseas air transport.(B.O.A.C. was the creation of the Conservative Government, andI hope that agreement can be reached on this one point without much difficulty.)If the first of these proposals meets with your general approval, perhaps you would authorise me to discuss it with the Chancellor as Chairman of theMachinery of Government Committee? I would not propose to trouble youpersonally with the second, but would ask that the subject of civil aviation shouldbe put clown again for consideration by the War Cabinet at an early date.(Intld.) A. H. M. S.29a July, 1944.
