THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (44) 472.2%th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.Civil Air Transport.CIVIL AIR CONVERSATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.Memorandum by the Lord Prtvy Seal.I. Sir Archibald Sinclair in his Paper* recommends us to ask Mr. Berlefor an International Conference on Civil Aviation forthwith or, alternatively, tosummons a Conference ourselves.2.   I am opposed to acting independently of the United States.3. Berle should be invited to postpone his project for moving out on to thecivil air routes of the world and he should be asked to hold an international conference as soon as possible.4. But if he does not consent we should offer to join him in declaring thatthe International Conference should be held after the War.5. In the meantime we should go forward on civil air operations in parallel with the United States, avoiding so far as possible any clash of interests.6. The United States will offer us a small share of her civil aircraft production for the development of our own air routes. We should refuse the offerwith thanks. It is imperative that our air line development should be based on british equipment and should go forward without delay.7.   Mr. Berle proposes : (i) That we should agree to an interim arrangement wherebv transport air-craft would be released from military use and air lines established ona non-exclusive basis to the principal centres of population. Inparticular he mentions Spain, the Western Mediterranean, north africa, the Middle East and South America,(ii) That an International Conference should be held at a later date (with no powers of regulation). Arrangements made during the interim period would be reviewed at this Conference.8. Mr. Berle makes complaint against B.O.A.C. policy; but only to justifyhis intentions of going forward. His complaint is, in fact, founded on amisapprehension.9. In my opinion Berle&apos;s new project is an Election programme. It alsotakes account of the present favourable disposition of the United Statescommunity towards Civil Aviation. America is building high hopes on CivilAviation in the period of reconstruction.10. Even so, Berle was no doubt subjected to pressure from the operational and manufacturing sides of the Air Transport Industry. Before pressure wasapplied he was satisfied with an agreement which, in effect, postponed everythinguntil after the Election. This agreement was made when Howe and I workedtogether at a meeting with Berle in New Brunswick.II. Later, when Berle propounded his new plan he demanded an immediateinterview and would not be put off. Thereafter, vexatious pressure was put onus down the line. There were misleading statements resulting in a declaration that the State Department would go forward without awaiting our decision.* W.P. (44) 473.[28096]
12. Firm and vigorous rejection of these proposals for immediate actionrestored us to a normal basis of negotiation.13. From this recital it will be seen that the United States has set its faceagainst projects for the International regulation of Civil Aviation.14. Thus we have come to the parting of the ways We can either go forward with the Americans or we can stand on our previous policy of inter-national collaboration excluding the United States. The issue involves the wholefuture of British Civil Aviation.  It must be decided by the War Cabinet.15. An answer to Berle$ will be sent in the form attached. It provides the necessary explanation to Parliament.16. I recommend an immediate and aggressive programme for theproduction of British aircraft suitable for Civil Aviation.B.Givydyr House, Whitehall, S.W. 1,2Qth August, 1944.Draft Telegram.For Berle from Beaverbrook.1. I have.now had an opportunity of consulting my colleagues on the subjectof your proposals to me of the 3rd August elaborated in your telegram of the23rd August.2. We ask you for a postponement of your project&apos;for moving out on tothe civil air routes of the World.3. We still feel that the next step should be to hold an international conference on the basis agreed between us in London last April, at the earliest date convenient to us both.4. If for domestic reasons you should find it difficult to hold a conferencein Washington at the present time, we shall understand your position and standready to call a conference ourselves in London.
