THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 486.1st September, 1944.FINANCE OF RELIEF.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their meeting on the 29th August (W.M. (44) 112th Conclusions,Minute 1) the War Cabinet asked me to report further in the light of thediscussion on the United States proposals for sharing the cost of relief in themilitary period.2. After consultation with the Minister of State, I attach as an appendix a draft telegram suggesting the line we should take.3. I understand that the Minister of State&apos;s view, in the light of his recent discussions in Washington, is that this is a reasonable line for us to take with the americans. It will largely achieve my object of limiting our liability, since itcalls a halt before we have incurred a net burden of more than  12^ million.4. The United States reaction may be to say that at the review called forin paragraph 2 (c) of the draft telegram the only action possible to limit furthernet expenditure by us will be to see that U.N.R.R.A. assumes financial responsi-bility for relief in the Balkans. I recognise that it is difficult to decide now at what point this will be possible. It will clearly be desirable anyhow on financial grounds that U.N.R.R.A. should assume financial responsibility as soon as it canbe arranged.  It is no doubt verv desirable, further, that U.N.R.R.A. should at theO */ .....earliest possible moment take full 7esponsibilityT for relief in the Balkans, whichis likely to be one of the chief fields in which it can be useful. I do not think,therefore, that we should have reason to object if the Americans took up theattitude suggested.5. With this explanation, I invite my colleagues to approve the draft telegram attached.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,1st September, 1944.APPENDIX.Draft Telecram to Washington.Ministers have considered question of finance of relief in the military periodon the basis of a paper following the lines of Mr. La\v&apos;s letter to the Chancellorof the 11th July. They noted that while the State Department have not felt ableto accept our proposal for division of the net cost based on U.N.R.R.A. propor-tions, their own plan goes a very considerable way to meet our difficulties. they decided, therefore, that they would be prepared to accept a solution on the linesof the American plan.[28127]Copy No.WAR CABINET.
2.   This decision is subject to three provisos : (a) First, Ministers expect the proportions of 64/36 as between the UnitedStates on the one hand, and the United Kingdom and Canada on theother, to be modified in our favour after taking into account the factors mentioned in Relief 288. Though we think we could arguefor still better terms, we think a reasonable settlement would be to fix the proportions at 70/30 see my immediately following telegram.(b) Ministers took the view that the proposed settlement should extend overthe wdiole field outside the scope of U.N.R.R.A. i.e., it should be understood that whatever the mechanism (compare Sever 704) for theprovision of supplies for relief and rehabilitation not sponsored by .N.R.R.A., no other financial arrangements should be contemplatedunless and until the billion dollar plan is exhausted. This accordswith our Parliamentary authority which rests on the Chancellorsspeech last January when presenting the Vote of Credit in which he asked for  80 million for relief and rehabilitation plus something that might be required before U.N.R.R.A. began operations. TheAmerican plan occupies the place of that something. Mr. Law&apos;party on arrival in Washington will be able to give further explana-tion of our position as necessary.(c) Ministers recalled that the United Kingdom proposal that the net costof relief in the military period should be based on the proportions ofthe United States and United Kingdom contributions to U.N.R.R.A.was coupled with the propositions that U.K.R.R.A. should assumefinancial responsibility for relief in the Balkans at a very early stage and should be empowered to pay for supplies which it might benecessary to send into ex-enemy territories., They do not wish toraise the latter question at this point but they assume that on the first the United States view remains the same as theirs. They assume that the United States estimate of 80 per cent, repayment is basedon this view. In these circumstances they think it must be clearly understood between us that if and when it becomes likely that morethan $200 million worth will have to be given away, the whole situation should be reviewed afresh between the United States, canada and the United Kingdom.3. We understand that Canada&apos;s request for membership of the C.C.A.C./S.is about to be granted. In these circumstances we think that further clarification of the billion dollar plan should be carried on in three-party negotiations withthe Canadians included. We believe that in fact they have been kept fairlyfully in touch with discussions up to date. But we think it proper that theyshould now be more definitely associated with further progress.4. We are telegraphing separately about the machinery required for implementing the American plan in reply to your Relief 355.
