THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.W.P. (44) 495.3rd September, 1944.SECRET.Copy No.WAR CABINET.SIGNATURE OF THE ARMISTICE WITH THE AXIS SATELLITES.Memorandum by the Secretary&apos; of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Italian Armistice was signed by General Eisenhower on behalf of theUnited Nations Governments at war with Italy. By adhering to this precedent of a single military signatory we shall avoid the difficulties inherent in signatureby more than one representative or by political representatives. This applies particularly to the Dominions, who, though they are quite ready to agree that amilitary representative should sign on their behalf, would each wish to signseparately if there was a question of signature by political representatives.2. Without prejudice to signature of the Instrument of Surrender for germany which clearly stands by itself, I propose, therefore, to try to arrange that the Armistice with the Axis Satellites should be signed by one military representative on behalf of all the United Nations Governments who are at warwith the particular Satellite. In the case of Bulgaria, we have suggested thatGeneral Wilson or his representative should sign. In the case of Roumania, Ihave informed the Soviet Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladly authorise a Soviet General to sign on their behalf. I would propose tomake similar communication in regard to Finland. In the case of Hungary the signatory would be either a Russian or an Anglo-American General depending onwhere the Armistice is concluded.A. E.Foreign Office, 3rd September, 1944.12503   [28141]
