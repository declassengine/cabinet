NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Carrier-borne aircraft of the Home Fleet have made several attacks onthe Tirpitz.Packing, in .Sumatra, has been heavily attacked by carrier-borne aircraft ofthe Eastern Fleet.Our patrols have fought many engagements in the Channel.A convoy of 34 ships from the UK. has arrived intact in North Russia.Northern Waters.2. Between the 21st and the 24th carrier-borne aircraft made several attacks on the Tirpitz in Altenfiord. H.M.S. Duke of York and ships of the Home Fleetcovered and supported the operations. On every occasion the Tirpitz was covered by smoke and no results could be observed. Four hits and one possiblehit with 500-lb. bombs and two possible hits with 1,000-lb. bombs were claimed.Attacks were also made on aircraft, hangars, radar stations and shipping in theHammerfest area by fighters. Seven of our aircraft were lost. On the 29thanother attack was made on the Tirpitz : but again, owing to smoke, no results were seen.3. The Russian battleship Archangel (late Royal Sovereign) arrived in aNorth Russian port with eight destroyers transferred from the Royal Navy onthe 24th.   On the following clay a convoy of 34 ships from the U.K. also arrived.4. H.M. S/M Satyr on patrol off the south-west of Norway probablytorpedoed a 3,500-ton ship on the 20th and, two days later, probably obtained hitson a convoy of five ships.Home Waters.5. On the 29th (D + 83) the number of troops landed in Normandy reachedtwo million. The totals up to p.m. on that day were 2,004,438 men, 421,147vehicles and 3,153,476 tons of stores.6. The week has been remarkable for the number of actions fought in theChannel.Early on the 24th, H.M. ships Melbreak and Talybont (destroyers) withM.T.Bs. engaged enemy R-boats and other craft off Cap d&apos;Antifer under the fireof shore batteries. One armed coaster was sunk, one auxiliary was probablytorpedoed and a trawler was left on fire.On the following night there were several engagements with ships fromHavre. U.S. P.T. boats chased four E-boats and damaged one of them. M.T.Bs.attacked a convoy north of Cap d&apos;Antifer and probably sank a trawler.H.M. ships Talybont (destroyer) and Retalick (frigate) in an attack on E-boatspreceding the convoy sank one, seriously damaged another and probably damaged a third. M.T.Bs. severely damaged two R-boats in an action at close range.Other M.T.Bs. engaged five T.L.Cs. and sank one of them. H.M.S. Bleasdale(destroyer) covering convoys, intercepted two E-boats, one of which was damaged.Our forces sustained only superficial damage and three slight casualties duringthe night.On the night of the 25th/26th the French destroyer La Combattante,HALS. Thornborough, (frigate) and M.T.Bs. intercepted a convoy of coastersescorted by auxiliaries and R-boats south-west of Fecamp. Two coasters andone R-boat were sunk, two coasters probably sunk and two other ships drivenashore.  M.T.Bs. also damaged a trawler off Boulogne on the same night.Early on the 27th, H.M. ships Middleton (destroyer) and Retalick, withM.T.Bs. and U.S. P.T. boats, attacked a force of eight T.L.Cs. off Gap d&apos;Antifer.Four of the T.L.Cs. were sunk and one was driven ashore. Middleton sustainedslight damage and one casualty.On the following night L,a Combattante, H.M.S. Thornborough andM.T.Bs. sank two 1,400-ton coasters and damaged two trawlers and some R-boats in a convoy northbound off Cap d&apos;Antifer.On the night of the 29th/30th H.M. ships Cattistock (destroyer) and Retalickintercepted a large convoy of at least 14 ships northbound from Fecamp. TheCattistock&apos;s bridge was hit and her captain killed. The Retalick, whileshadowing the convoy to Dieppe, drove off three E-boats and came under heavyfire from the shore.
7. Off the Dutch coast M.T.Bs. attacked a convoy on the night of the 24th/25th and torpedoed three ships, two of which are believed to have sunk. Twoniohts later M.T.Bs. intercepted another convoy off Ijmuiden and, in a sharpengagement with the escorts, torpedoed and probably sank an M-class mine-sweeper.   One M.T.B. was damaged and had one casualty.8. H.M.S. Gleaner (minesweeper) was damaged on the 25th by a mine west of Havre. On the 27th, while sweeping off Cap d&apos;Antifer, H.M. ships Britomartand Hussar (minesweepers) were sunk and Salamander (minesweeper) was damaged but was towed to port. The U.S. L.S.T. 327 was damaged, probably byniine,Dsouth of the Isle of Wight. H.M.S. Melbreak (destroyer) was bombed and damaged off Fecamp on the night of the 27th/28th : there Avere 14 casualtiesincluding 2 killed.Bay of Biscay.9. H.M.S. Warspite carried out a bombardment of Brest on the 25thin support of military operations.   Several heavy batteries were silenced.10. On the 26th, H.M.S. Albrighton (destroyer), in conjunction with aircraft, intercepted two trawlers off Penmarch (south of Brest) flying whiteflags.  Albrighton sank the trawlers after taking 22 prisoners.11. Reconnaissance of Brest on the 28th showed that the large dry dockhad been seriously damaged : ten huge craters were seen. The battleship hulkClemenceau was sunk.Mediterranean.12. Unloading figures on the coast of Provence up to 0600 on the 26th were208,896 men, 36,998 vehicles and 106,693 tons of stores and ammunition.13. The garrisons of Marseilles and Toulon capitulated on the 28th.Bombardments by Allied ships had continued during the week. On the 23rd theU.S.S. Nevada (battleship) engaged coastal batteries near Toulon and the cruisers Tuscaloosa and Brooklyn shelled the Cannes area. On the following day the Nevada and the U.S. cruisers Quincy and Philadelphia covered mine-sweeping operations by a bombardment north-west of Marseilles. The Frenchcruiser E7nile Bertin bombarded Nice harbour and damaged a bridge across theRiver Var. On the 25th, H.M. ships Aurora and Sirius (cruisers) and the french ships Lorraine (battleship) and Gloire (cruiser) bombarded the Mandrier area;the Emile Beriin and destroyers shelled troops and coastal batteries near Nice,and the U.S.S. Augusta (cruiser) bombarded the approaches to Marseilles. Onthe 26th, further bombardments were carried out by the U.S. ships Augusta andPhiladelphia, H.M. ships Aurora and Sirius and the French ships Lorraine andGloire. On the 27th H.M.S. Ramillies and two French cruisers bombardedMandrier.  Three U.S. destroyers also shelled coastal batteries and other targets.Aircraft from the escort carrier force continued their attacks on communica-tions in the Rhone Valley, in addition to attacking bridges and troop concentrations.14. An attempted attack by human torpedoes or explosive motor-boatswas broken up on the night of the 24th/25th by our inshore patrols off Antibes.On the following night destroyers drove off an attack by explosive motor-boats,of which they sank eight.On the 27th the U.S. destroyer Ericsson captured four U-boat officers and46 ratings attempting to escape in a fishing-boat from Toulon. Thirty-oneprisoners were also taken from boats by other U.S. destroyers.15. An advance party arrived to open the Port de Bouc on the night ofthe 27th/28th. Two berths are already available. The port of St. Raphael was opened earlier in the week.At Toulon the entrance to the harbour has been blocked but it can be cleared.Six berths will be available after dock repairs have been carried out.Reconnaissances of Nice and Villefranche show that the harbours havebeen severely damaged by demolitions but they are reported to be open to small craft.16.. Off Genoa, on the night of the 24th/25th, coastal forces torpedoed two ships, one of which sank. On the following day coastal forces in the Gulf ofGenoa torpedoed a destroyer.[28123]
17. In the Gulf of Trieste, on the night of the 24th/25th, coastal forcessank a 2.000-ton cargo ship. H.M.S. Loyal (destroyer) shelled enemy positionsnear Pessaro on the 28th.18. HM. S/M Vivid damaged a small tanker by shellfire on the 11th north of Suda Bay.East Indies.19. Early on the 24th aircraft from H.M. ships Indomitable and Victorious.which were supported and covered by Allied ships of the Eastern Fleet, attackedcement works near Padang (west coast of Sumatra) and Emmahaven, the port ofPadang. Complete surprise was achieved : there was only moderate anti-aircraft fire and little air opposition. The cement works were hit by a large number of heavy bombs. At Emmahaven one ship of 3.500 tons and another of 2,500 tons were set on fire and the harbour installations were severely damaged. In addition,fighters attacked the airfield at Padang. One of our aircraft was lost during theoperation.Anti-Submarine Operations.20. Twelve attacks were reported during the week. Of these, six wereby shore-based aircraft, two by carrier-borne aircraft and four by warships.Between the 20th and the 24th aircraft from HATS. Vinclex (escort carrier),escorting a convoy, probably sank one U-boat and possibly sank another off theNorth Cape. Two U-boats were possibly sunk in the Bay of Biscay bvH.M. Canadian destroyers of the 11th escort group on the 20th and by frigates ofthe 15th escort group on the 24th.21. During the passage of the convoy to North Russia 23 sightings and14 attacks were made by aircraft from HM. ships Vindex and Striker.Enemy Intelligence.22. Photographic reconnaissance on the 27th showed the Liitzotv, Eugen,Hipper, nurnberg, Koln and the two Schlesien class battleships all at Gdynia.23. Reconnaissance of Elbing shows that the production of Elbing classdestroyers is going forward at the expense of the Narvik class. Six Elbings arenow building and five are fitting out. There are now no effective enemy destroyers west of Germany. The twro Narviks at Bordeaux and La Palliceare reported to have been paid off: the destroyers bombed in the Gironde on the24th are now out of action.24. The effective strength in the Channel and Biscay ports is now about50&quot; E-boats between. Den Helder and Boulogne; 40/50 R-boats, 25 T.L.Cs. and six M-class minesweepers between Calais and Boulogne; 20 M-class minesweepersand six T.L.Cs. between Den Helder and Dunkirk; and 30/35 minesweepersbetween Brest and Bayonne.25. On the Biscay coast, Loctudy, Benodet and Concarneau (north ofLorient) were reported to be clear of the enemy on the 28th. On the 29th theGermans were reported to have evacuated St. Gilles sur Vie (40 miles S.W.of Nantes). At Sables D&apos;01onne, further to the south, all bridges were blownup and the harbour entrance was blocked to all but small ships at high water.Noirmoutier was still occupied.26. It is reported from Bayonne that nine small ships have been scuttledin the harbour and extensive demolitions carried out. St. Jean de Luz harbourhas also been mined.U-boats.27. In Home Waters U-boats appear to have begun operations in coastal areas where there are focal points for shipping. There has been a lull in thecentral part of the Channel.The evacuation of the Biscay ports is thought to be far advanced.In the entire Mediterranean also not more than six U-boats are believed to remain.28. In preparation for a projected offensive in the autumn, the germans are concentrating on twro pre-f abrieated types of U-boat of 1,600 tons and
180 tons. Both are believed to have an abnormal submerged speed. They arelikely to be fitted with an underwater breathing apparatus known as &quot; Schnorkel.&quot;Of the larger type there are estimated to be 28 on the slips, ten fitting out and four launched and working up. Corresponding figures for the smaller typeare five, nine and four or five.Enemy Attack on Shipping.29. During the week two ships were sunk by U-boats in the English channel and a U.S. tanker, in convoy, was sunk off the north coast of Ireland (R). One$mall tanker was sunk by mine in the assault area off Arromanches.Protection of Seaborne Trade.30. During the week ending the 27th, 631 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 207 were in ocean convoys and424 in British coastal convoys. One escort carrier, 31 destroyers (including 11U.S. destroyers) and 67 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employedon escort duties. Three homebound convoys, consisting of 165 ships, and fiveoutward-bound convoys, of 207 ships, reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.31.   Mines have been laid by surface craft in the English Channel.  aircraft have laid mines in the Baltic, off the Biscay ports and in the Danube.Mines have also been laid by U.S. aircraft off the Andamans.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.32. There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy aircraft in home waters.Off the Normandy coast a small dangerous area has been declared north ofCourseulles. Forty ground mines were destroyed, bringing the total of minesdestroyed to date up to 1,155. The approaches and entrance to the Caen Canalhave been swept.33. In the south of France a large dangerous area has been declared fromfive miles east of Toulon to 30 miles west of Marseilles, and searched channelshave been established. On one day of the week 38 mines were destroyed north-west of Marseilles.The mine totals are 5,425 ground and 5,667 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.34. Air reconnaissance of the Gironde on the 25th shoAved that 15 ships, ofover 72,000 tons total, were being scuttled below Bordeaux. Many of these had been blockade runners. At Bordeaux there were, in addition, five ships of atotal of 19,500 tons.35. It is reported that Finnish ships which have been detained in Swedishports are to be confiscated. In some cases the Finnish companies have beennegotiating for the transfer of their shipping to Sweden and the Germans are trying to divert these ships from Swedish waters to other routes.36 The Rumanian mercantile marine has been almost annihilated duringthe war and, prior to the fall of Constanza, it was believed to consist of no morethan seven ships. Of these, five totalling 17,650 tons were at Constanza and thetwo liners Bessarabia and Transilvania, each of 6,672 tons, are laid up atIstanbul.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.37. The Russians have captured Tartu and made further progress towardsValka from the east.[28123] b 2
Central Sector.38. In spite of German counter-attacks the Russians have gained a littleground S.W. of Lomza.Southern Sector.39. On the evening of the 23rd the Rumanians declared their willingness to accept an armistice, and two days later they declared war on Germany.Profiting by the situation thus created, the Russians have made very rapid head-way. The two thrusts comprising their offensive in this sector linked up on the25th, resulting in the encirclement of a German force, estimated by the Russiansat 12 divisions, in the area S.W. of Kishinev. Since then the Russians havereached the Danube, taken Galatz, and overrun the fortified &quot; Galatz Gap&quot;between the Carpathians and the town. The Germans report that the russian troops are advancing through the Carpathians in the area of the Hungarianfrontier. The Russians have also continued southwards and have captured Ploestiand reached the general line of the railway Ploesti-Constanza on a front of about80 miles. A Russian armoured force thrust southwards to take Constanza inco-operation with the Russian fleet. This port will be extremely useful for theRussians, who can send supplies there by sea from Odessa, thus avoiding thedifficulties of the change in railway gauge; it may be presumed that the bulkof Rumanian rolling-stock is safely7 in Rumanian hands and therefore at thedisposal of the Russians.The German forces south of the Galatz Gap appear to have lost cohesion,and it seems unlikely that they will be able to offer any firm resistance to a furtherRussian advance through Rumania.Northern France.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.40. The past week has seen further spectacular advances in northern france.&apos; U.S. forces have driven out east and N.E. of Paris, across the Marneand Aisne. All enemy south of the Seine has been liquidated and British and canadian troops in force are across the river streaming out to the Somme.12th U.S. Army Group.41. The Third U.S. Army, under General Patton, continued its advancessouth of Paris to the east and N.E. against very little opposition. At the begin-ning of the week, U.S. forces pushed out beyrond Sens to Troy^es and by the 29th.troops of the First and Third U.S. armies were up to the Marne on the 50-milestretch of the river between Chateau-Thierry and Paris, with advance elementsup to the Aisne. On the following day, they captured the important towns ofVitry, Chalons, Reims and Soissons while leading elements advanced east to within 20-25 miles of Verdun and N.E., across the Aisne, to the outskirts of Laon.The First U.S. Army was widely extended in this period. On the right itsforces moved quickly and were in contact with forces of the Third U.S. Armyacross the Aisne; in the centre other forces, with General Leclerc&apos;s FrenchArmoured Division leading, moved into Paris after its liberation by french forces of the Interior, and finally quelled the last remnants of resistance. Onits left flank, it expanded the bridgehead at Mantes Gassicourt.In Brittany the attack on Brest, with support from the sea and air, wasbegun on the 25*th, but, although U.S. forces have made some headway, the enemygarrison of some 20.000 troops is still putting up a strong resistance.21st A rmy Group.42. At the beginning of the week, while the British and Canadian Armiesdeveloped their advances east towards the Seine, U.S forces from the area ofMantes Gassicourt drove north along its left bank to Elbeuf and set a secondtrap for the Germans west of the SeineThe British and Canadian advances, which met heavy resistance in the coastalsector, contracted this new pocket and drove the Germans back N.E. to the Seinebetween Rouen and the sea where Allied air forces hammered at the enemycrossing places and did great destruction among the barges and river craft. Onthe 25th contact was established with the U.S. forces near Elbeuf and during&apos;the 25th/26th two new crossings were secured, when British troops fought their way across the River at Vernon and Canadians at Pont De L&apos;Arche some10 miles south of Rouen. During the next few days British and Canadian troopsclosed further up the Seine.   At the mouth of the River fighting was especially
fierce as the enemy engaged in desperate rearguard actions to protect the crossingplaces for his remaining troops to escape. By the 30th, however, the great loopsof the river into which the enemy had been pushed had been cleaned up andresistance south of the river had ceased.Further up the river the bridgeheads at Vernon and Pont de 1&apos;Archewere steadily expanded, and a new crossing was made east of Louviers. By the30th these separate bridgeheads and that at Mantes Gassicourt had coalesced toform a single lodgment across the river over 40 miles in breadth from which british armoured forces in strength were leading the hunt towards the Somme.At last light on the 30th these forces had passed Beauvais, Songeons and Gournayand armoured forces had reached Grandvilliers. On the left of this drive theCanadian armour was moving N.W., east of Rouen, and had reached an areaabout 3 miles S.W. of Buchy. The German News Agency reported the evacuation of Rouen, and it has since been occupied by our troops.A dministration.43. The progress of the battle during August has completely changed theadministrative situation in Northern France. Up to early August the allied armies had been contained within a small bridgehead. The policy at that time was to build up stocks of supplies, ammunition and petrol and to get as much aspossible over the beaches before winter.The advance across the Seine and beyond Paris has made things quite different. The L. of C. have lengthened out and the problem is now one of movement where the administrative services will be strained to the utmost inorder to maintain the momentum of our advance.Conclusion.44. It is estimated that in the two and a half months&apos; fighting- since the campaign in Northern France opened, the enemy has had 13 divisions destroyed and another 19 reduced to remnants.The German Seventh Army has been broken and driven back with crippling-losses, the initiative is now securely in Allied hands and the August battles havebeen decisive.Southern France.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)45. Lieutenant-General Patch&apos;s Seventh Army has continued to make swiftprogress against what remains of the German forces in Southern France.The Riviera flank has been steadily pushed out to the general line of theVar; opposition was encountered near the mouth of the river but patrols, andin one place a considerable force of infantry, have now forced the crossing.Farther north, strong; columns have ranged as far as the Col de Larche in theCottian Alps. Beyond Grenoble, U.S. troops moved out across the River Iseretowards Lyons and are now well established as far forward as Bourgoin.The most important action, however, has centred around the 20-mile stretchof the Rhone Valley between the gorge at Donzere and the River Drome. U.S.troops reached Carpentras on the 25th and at once attacked northwards throughVaison to Salles and Pierrelette. Meantime, troops from the northern sector hadswung westwards through Die and seized the high ground overlookingMontelimar from the N.E., although they do not appear completely to have closedthe main road to Valence. The enemy were then forced out of the MontelimarPlain up to the River Drome around Loriol. Here the bridges are down and attacks are developing along both banks.French forces, under General de Lattre de Tassigny, have captured Toulonand Marseilles. The garrisons resisted stubbornly and several days of street lighting were necessary before the final capitulation of both cities came on the28th. When U.S. forces transferred their activities to the north of the RiverDurance, French Armour passed through to the lower Rhone and occupied Ariesand Tarascon (25th), and Avignon (26th). Armoured columns are now operating-west of the river to Bagnols and Nimes.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)46. By the 25th the Polish forces had established themselves along theRiver Metauro from its mouth to Fossombrone. On the next day Eighth Armytroops continued the attack, and numerous crossings of the river were made.
Steady progress was maintained and enemy opposition was patchy, determined in some places and weak in others. On the 27th Fano was occupied, and on the29th the line of the River Foglia was reached at many places. Further inlandthe town of Urbino was occupied. On the 30th armoured cars entered the town of Pesaro, and readied the line of the River Foglia, which runs through thenorthern part of the town.In the mountainous country which overlooks the cOastal area, the enemypulled back in conformity with his withdrawals in the coastal sector. On the29th our mobile forces occupied the village of St. Angelo, which lies on themain Urbania-Sansepolcro road, and on the next clay Urbania itself was occupied. In the upper valley of the River Arno the enemy has been steadilypushed back by Indian troops, and by the 29th the town of Bibbiena was foundto be clear. Advancing north-westwards from the town, Indian troops regainedcontact with the enemy in the area of Poppi.In the area to the east and N.E. of Florence, the enemy has been forced towithdraw towards his Gothic Line positions. On the 26th troops from a Britisharmoured formation advanced astride the Pontassieve-Poppi road for some3 or 4 miles. Demolitions then impeded further progress. Between Pontassieveand Florence Indian troops crossed to the north of the River Arno, but build-upon the north bank was slow, as crossings had to be made under enemy shell-fire,and most of the bridges were demolished. Our troops were last reported in contact with the enemy some 3 miles south of Dicomano. From Florence to thesea no changes in our dispositions have taken place. Activity has been confined to patrol work and numerous skirmishes and fire-fights . with the enemy have resulted.Yugoslavia.47. The Partisans claim to have halted the German drive westwards intoMontenegro by a counter-attack, in which they have recaptured Kolasin (70 miles .E. of Dubrovnik). They also claim further successes against Bulgarian andCetnik forces in Serbia.Burma.Chin Hills and Chindwin.48. Our advance down the Imphal-Tiddim Road continues. Leading-troops are now 7 miles south of the Burma border. Enemy resistance is stillslight. In the Tamu area, our troops, advancing eastwards, have now reachedthe Chindwin River at the village of Hwemate.North Burma.49. Allied troops have captured the village of Pinbaw, on the Myitkyina-Katha railway.Pacific Theatre.50. Further TJ.S. landings have been made on Biak Island to prevent the escape of Japanese survivors.AIR SITUATION.General Review.51. In Normandy, German troops attempting to disengage were persistentlyharassed from the air; much mechanised transport was destroyed. The&quot;softening&quot; of the Brest defences continued. Strategical bombing was maintained on a large scale by home-based and M.A.A.F. aircraft against oiltargets, aircraft plants and industrial targets. The East Prussian bases ofStettin and Konigsberg were attacked in strength. Communications in northern italy were heavily bombed.There was a decrease in the number of flying-bombs launched against theUnited Kingdom.United Kingdom.52. Flying-bomb attacks are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and home security.&quot; Fighters flew 1,11.3 sorties against these attacks and destroyed75 flying bombs.
During the week, a F.W. 190 crashed on the North Foreland; the pilot wastaken prisoner.Home Waters.53. Aircraft of Coastal Command, 9 of which are missing, flew 869 sortiesinvolving 8,178 flying hours. Bomber Command aircraft (one crashed in thesea) laid 434 sea-mines.A number of attacks was made on shipping off the north and west coastsof France and off the Frisians, during which two E/R boats, an unidentified ship and an abandoned minesweeper were sunk and the following vessels left burning :four E/R boats, two escort vessels, a minesweeper, an armed trawler, two5,000-ton ships, one of 2,000 tons, one of 1,500 tons, two 800-tonners and oneunidentified ship. The results of several other attacks, though promising, couldnot be precisely assessed.Western Front.54. Tactical operations were aimed principally at the elimination anddemoralisation of the enemy&apos;s forces in retreat and the destruction of histransportation facilities. Strategically, the demolition of his resources in oil,aircraft, A.F.V., and armaments continued to provide the main activity for ourheavy bombers.A total of 29,407 sorties was flown, 23,659 tons of bombs were dropped andmore than 2,000 R.P. were discharged. Enemy losses in combat were 175 aircraft-destroyed, 27 probably destroyed and 66 damaged. At least 218 more aircraft and ten seaplanes were destroyed on the ground and on the water. During theweek, 174 Allied heavy and medium bombers and 154 fighters and fighter-bombers were reported missing.Operations by the G.A.F. showed little change from recent weeks. In theSeine area, where need was great, fighters were seldom seen; the maximum of250 wras estimated to have been airborne on the 24th but, later in the week, theday&apos;s figure fell to 75 for the total fighter effort in northern France. Up to60 long-range bombers operated along the Seine valley on one night, but theaArerage was appreciably lower and may be regarded as token operations for the encouragement of their land forces. The exception was a sharp and well concen-trated raid on Paris on the night 26th/27th, which caused a substantial amount of damage. Opposition in Germany was uneven night-fighters put upa measure of otroosition to the attacks on Stettin. TConigsberg, Riisselsheirn. andKiel, and during daylight about 50 fighters attempted interception in the Rostockand also in the Merseburg areas but, on the remainder of our offensive operations,fighter opposition was negligible or non-existent, possibly due, in part, to poorweather. A few jet-propelled fighters were sighted near Leeuwarden, four nearMinister and three over Belgium.France and the Lotv Countries.Operations were carried out, both by day and at night, against enemycrossings on the Seine, near Rouen, road movements between Rouen and Beauvaisand rail traffic east of Paris. Armed reconnaissances also extended to the Franco-German frontier and south as far as Lyons, jMedium bombers dropped 270 tons in an attack on M.T. vehicles concentratedwest of Rouen and, later, dropped 105 tons on the ferry at Duclair in the same area. A further 1,200 tons of bombs were dropped and over 2,000 R.P. were discharged on similar missions, and many attacks with M.G. and cannon weremade. This persistent harrassing of the enemy resulted in a heavy toil of transportation; the following are claimed to have been destroyed, besides largenumbers severely damaged : 1,450 M.T. vehicles, 70 heavy duty vehicles, 54 tanks,45 A.F.V., 21 staff cars, 50 horse-drawn vehicles and 110 horses, 3 ammunitiontrains and 11 ammunition trucks, 515 locomotives, 1,100 railroad cars and trucks(including 200 oil cars) and 40 barges.Medium and heavy bombers attacked the port of Brest in daylight and at night; a total of 2,250 tons of bombs was released with the object of immobilisingthe battleship hulk Clemenceau and shipping in harbour and dry dock, and of destroying the arsenal, batteries and strong-points guarding the town. Coastalguns at St. Brieuc (115 tons) and E/R boat pens and moorings at Ijmuiden,Holland (120 tons), were also bombed.
A total of 1,000 tons of bombs was dropped on ammunition, fuel and oil storage dumps in and near the battle areas and 225 tons were released on fivechemical works in north-east France and Belgium.Approximately 1,225 tons were dropped on long-range weapon installationsat Watton and Marquise and about the same tonnage on 12 flying-bomb launching-sites. An attack was also made on the experimental stations at Peenemunde andRechlin as reported in the next paragraph.
