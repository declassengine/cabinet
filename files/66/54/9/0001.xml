THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY of HiS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 459. .19*A August, 1944. j       HWAR CABINET. J ./FINANCE OF RELIEF IN THE MILITARY PERIOD.Memorandum by the Minister of State.THE War Cabinet on the 20th January endorsed the view that the figure of 80 million, or 1 per cent, of our national income, must be regarded as themaximum United Kingdom contribution to relief in all areas and at all times.2.   From this would follow that any expenditure on relief which we incurred ,in the military period would be debited against our contribution to the united nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.3. This view was put to the State Department and they were told that theChancellor of the Exchequer would express this view in presenting to parliament the Vote of Credit, which would include our contribution of  80 million toU.N.R.R.A.4. The State Department dissented strongly, and maintained that thecontributions by the member Governments of U.N.R.R.A. of 1 per cent, of their national incomes were contributions to relief to be administered by U.N.R.R.A.,and were not for relief outside U.N.R.R.A., e.g., in the military period. In theview of the State Department, no other interpretation of the Atlantic CityResolutions was possible, and if we persisted in our interpretation they thoughtit would be impossible to secure Congressional approval to the United Statescontribution to U.N.R.R.A., and thereby the whole structure of U.N.R.R.A. wouldbe endangered.5. The upshot was that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in presenting the vote of Credit to the House of Commons on the 25th January, 1944, used thefollowing language : &apos;&apos;&apos; We recognise that during this period relief to the civil population willhave to be administered at first by the civil affairs staff of the commander in the field. We realise, therefore, that the burden of a measure of relief mayfall on us which, in practice, may turn out to be in addition to our 80 million.&quot;6. We then endeavoured to reach an agreement with the United states authorities that, for relief supplies outside U.N.R.R.A., the cost of procurementin countries other than the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada (inso far as it is not recovered from the recipient countries) should be divided between the United States and the United Kingdom in the relative proportions of our contributions to U.N.R.R.A. Any loss incurred in making supplies available from domestic sources would, under this arrangement, be borne by thesupplying countries. We had a reasonable case for putting forward this proposal,especially as it puts the emphasis where it really ought to be from our point ofview, i.e., on our foreign exchange difficulties.7. Nevertheless, after prolonged discussions, it has been found impossibleto reach an agreement on this basis.8. The present position is that Congress has authorised the provision ofthe full United States contribution to UN.R.R.A of $1,320 million; and for thecurrent financial year has actually appropriated $800 million of this sum. we and the Canadians have each voted our contribution of  80 million and$77 million respectively.9. For the military period, the United States authorities have actuallyappropriated $563 million, and we have stated that, in addition to our 80 million contribution to U.N.R.R.A., we shall have to finance some relief inthe military period, the exact extent of which we do not know, but which we hopewill not be large.12484   [28046]
10. The principal difficulty we have to meet in this regard is that neitherwe nor the Americans can accurately forecast what will be the cost of providingrelief in the military period. We have, therefore, necessarily to work on a seriesof assumptions, knowing as we do so that in the event these may prove to be wrong. What, however, we can do is to take every step we can to safeguardourselves against having to assume an unknown liability for an unknown period and in proportions which clearly clo not fairly represent the respective financialstrengths of our two countries.11. It is clear on a review of the protracted discussions which have takenplace in Washington that the United States authorities, while recognising our foreign exchange difficulties, have approached the problem from an entirely different angle to ourselves, and that there is little hope of reaching a solution onthe lines set out in paragraph 6 above. The United States authorities have,however, made tentative proposals for a solution on other lines. In dealing withthese proposals we should recognise on our own part that.some effort has beenmade to meet us, and consider whether we should really endanger our interests ifwe agreed to attack the problem on the United States lines.12. What the United States suggest is that we. the Canadians and theyshould agree to procure supplies for military relief up to a total of 81,000 million.This amount is an estimate of the supplies that ought to be procured if theAllied Commanders are to have means of supplying civilian populations duringan initial period of six months in the European countries for which the Anglo-American forces would be responsible. The six months is taken as the period during which the military may have to retain responsibility, though in some areasthey will be able to relinquish this responsibility earlier. The amount of81.000 million may therefore be too large. Equally, too, if things turn out verydifferently from expectations, it may be possible that .it may be too small. TheAmerican proposal, however, is that we should plan the financial arrangements onthe basis that S 1,000 million will be required, and we, on our part, should makeit clear that, in accepting the plan, we were not to be held to be giving any indica-tion that we should be prepared to extend our commitment beyond our share ofthis total.13. Under this proposal, the three countries would then agree to theproportion in which each would stand the loss on such part of the billion-dollaroutlay as is not recovered in repayments from the recipient countries. the canadians have tentatively agreed in respect of supplies from Canada to standa loss of up to 8 per cent, of the total, and whilst the United States authoritieshave yet to state exactly what part of the loss they would be prepared to stand,it seems fairly evident on an outlay of up to Si billion they should be ready tomeet some 65 per cent, to 70 per cent, of the bill. On this showing our share wouldbe somewhere between 27 per cent, and 22 per cent., or on an initial outlay ofSi billion the equivalent of say 8220 million to 8270 million, or between 55 million and  69 million. It is, of course, very difficult to say what proportionof the sum of  55 million to  69 million would be repaid by the Allies. TheUnited States authorities estimate that 80 per cent, would be repaid; in which case the net additional cost which we should have to finance would be some 11 million to  14 million. A safer estimate, probably over conservative, wouldseem to be 50 per cent.; in which case the net additional cost which we would incurfor military relief would be  27 million to  35 million. On this basis, however,Canada would be called upon to bear a loss of S40 million. Considerations bothof supply and of finance make it, in fact, very doubtful whether Canada wouldbe in a position to bear a loss of that size, and in that event the figure of&quot; 35 million for the upper limit of the cost to the United Kingdom might beincreased to  40 million.14. With oui-&quot; present preoccupation about the increase in our overseasliabilities, these sums are considerable. We are, however, committed to some financial burden for military relief in addition to our contribution to U.N.R.R.A.,and it is relevant to reflect that the difference in the burden falling on us betweenthe proposal that we have hitherto put forward and the new American plan is not likely to be so great as to give us good ground for refusing to do our best to find a solution along the lines of the American approach. Indeed, it is likely that even under our own plan the total net cost falling on the Exchequer (on thebasis of 50 per cent, repayment) would be in the neighbourhood of  30 million,while as shown in the attached Note on the Foreign Exchange Aspect, whichhas been drawn up in agreement with the Treasury, the maximum addition tothe United Kingdom foreign exchange liability under the United States plan ascompared with the United Kingdom plan is not likely to exceed  5-6 million.
It should be noted that, on the United States&apos; calculations, the cost of procurementby the United Kingdom for this plan outside the sterling area would be no morethan the sums we shall receive in payment from the Allies so that we should sufferno direct net loss of foreign exchange.15. This question cannot be considered solely in its purely financial aspects.Our failure so far to come to agreement with the Americans on this issue has caused much difficulty for both sides, has handicapped the work both of the combined supply and of the combined military planning machinery and, in somecases, has even prejudiced precurement for military operations. This has causedtension which, from a political point of view, it is most desirable to remove inview of the very important discussions on our general financial position in stage II and Stage III which are to be opened in the near future. Whilemilitary operations are conducted on a fully combined basis it is inevitable thatthe United States authorities should look to us to bear a share of the expenditureon relief which these operations involve, and our objective should be to reach an agreement with them as soon as possible on the proportions in which thisinevitable expenditure is to be met, and so remove a not unimportant cause ofirritation before discussions on issues of more vital importance commence.16. It seems desirable, therefore, to reach if possible a settlement of thisquestion. If the War Cabinet shares this view the suggestion of the ForeignOffice is that we should conclude an agreement with the Americans on a basislimited to an initial outlay of Si billion, which would leave us with a maximumrisk of not more than S300 million. We would, of course, do everything possibleto secure a more favourable division of the burden, but even if we have to go tothe lengths suggested above, it is to be hoped that our actual liability would bereduced by repayments from the recipient countries, at least to S150 million and very probably more nearly to 8120 million or  30 million.17. It will be essential that any settlement reached on the lines proposedin paragraph 16 should cover the whole field of relief outside the scope of u.N.R.R.A.. so that we should have a definite, though not precisely defined,measure of the liabilities assumed by the United Kingdom for. relief of all kinds.We have recently been faced with a proposal by the Americans to, abandonarmistice claims on the Italians for the lira element in the pay of Allied troopsin Italy. The reason for the American proposal is that administration has noappropriation from Congress within which it can conveniently finance further supplies to Italy. The proposal is open to very strong and various objections which we have telegraphed to Washington, and it now seems likely that the americans will agree to a modified form of their proposal which involves no alteration in our own arrangements for financing supplies to Italy and leavesunaffected the liabilities of Italy under the Armistice. The proposal, however,is an illustration of the sort of objectionable ad hoc arrangements which mightbe proposed to us at any time if we do not get a general settlement to cover thewhole field outside U.N.R.R.A.; this is an additional argument for attempting to reach a settlement as proposed in paragraph 16 above, but is also an argument for only doing so if it is a comprehensive one. We can hardly expect the UnitedStates to agree at this stage that if the proposed billion dollars, in addition tothe 1 per cent, contributions to U.N.R.R.A., should be exhausted before theessential needs are met, all further funds should come from the United States.But we should expect them to agree not to pursue other devices so long as thesefunds are available.18. In view, therefore, of the importance of reaching a settlement of thisquestion as soon as possible, I suggest that Lord Halifax should be instructedto open negotiations in Washington to that end. He would, of course, act inclose concert with the Treasury Delegation. An early start to these negotiations is desirable so that the question may be disposed of before the opening of thesecond Council meeting of U.N.R.R.A at Montreal on the 15th September.R, L.Foreign Office, IWi August, 1944.Note on Foreign Exchange Aspect.The principle of the United Kingdom proposal is that procurement in third countries including in that term the Dominions (other than Canada) and india as well as foreign countries should be divided between the United Kingdom andthe United States in U.N.R.R.A. proportions, which are roughly one to &quot;four.  The
principle of the United States proposal is that the United States should procureall that is required in the Carribean and Latin America other than the Argentine,and the United Kingdom should procure all that is required in other countries(outside the United States and the United Kingdom) apart from Argentina.Procurement in Argentina should be shared 50/50.The supplies at present estimated to be required for military period reliefby the Anglo-American forces have been valued in Washington at 3764 million.A provisional allocation of sources of supply has been made in Washington ofthe major portion of this amount up to a value of $643 million as follows :  Million dollars.United States ............      411-united Kingdom      ............      228 - 6Canada ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 3giving the proportions 64 per cent., 28 per cent, and 8 per cent. These figures are derived as follows. The United States share is 64 per cent, of the total:leaving 36 per cent, for United Kingdom and Canada. Canada has offered tobear up to 8 per cent, leaving 28 per cent, for United Kingdom.It is only possible, therefore, to compare the foreign exchange burden weshould be assuming under the United Kingdom and United States plansrespectively in respect of a portion of our liability in the total; a portionamounting to between $600 million and $700 million or little more than half ofthe billion dollars total in respect of which it is suggested we should accept theAmerican proposals.The total of 3rd Country Procurement under the Washington allocationsis as follows : Million dollars.Australian Wheat    .........     &quot;... 18-23French African Coffee       ...      ...     &quot;... 4-60.   Argentine Wheat     ............ 24-38Latin American Coffee       ...      ...       ... 7-26Caribbean Sugar      ...      ...      ...      ... 8-53Total      ............      63 00On the United Kingdom plan we should in principle be procuring 1/5 andour liability would be $12-60 million.On the United States plan we are responsible for Australian Wheat(100 per cent.) French African coffee (100 per cent.), and. Argentine wheat(50 per cent.) and our liability would be $35-02 million.The difference is, therefore, $22-42 million.If Australian wheat is excluded, the figures are f 8-95 million on the UnitedKingdom plan and $16-79 million on United States plan.The difference is then $7-84 million.The Americans forecast that 80 per cent, of the initial procurement will-be repaid by the recipient countries. Mr. Law puts a conservative estimate forwardof 50 per cent. On the American forecast the foregoing figures of $22-4 million and $7-8 million fall to be reduced to $4-5 million and $1-6 million. on mr. Law&apos;s conservative forecast the reduction would be to $11-2 million and$3-9 million.On this showing the maximum difference in the United Kingdom foreign exchange liability between the United States and United Kingdom proposals inrespect of rather more than half the billion dollars put forward as the limit inthe United States plan would be $11-2 million. It is difficult to say whetherthe difference on the whole billion dollars would be more than twice this amount.It would be likely to be more in so far as the amounts that could be drawn fromthe United Kingdom and perhaps Australia were reduced and the Argentinewas made a larger source of supply. On the other hand, is so far as the UnitedStates itself became a larger source of supply, this tendency would be neutralised.The foregoing calculations take no account of possible foreign origin of the content of supplies other than food to be made available by the United Kingdom,e.g.j medical and sanitary supplies, clothing, textiles and footwear and agricul-tural requisites. The total of United Kingdom responsibility for these isestimated in the Washington paper at $50 million.Foreign Office, S.W. 1, ldth August, 1944.
