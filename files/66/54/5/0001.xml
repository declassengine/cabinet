THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.   &apos;SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (41) 455.\Wi August, 1944.WAR CABINET.FINANCE OF SUPPLIES TO ITALY.Memorandum by the Minister of State.SINCE the occupation we and the United States have been sending to Italysuch relief supplies as are necessary to prevent disease and unrest. these supplies have been financed on our side by Vote of Credit, and on the Americanside by a War Department Appropriation. The War Department now statethat on account of an undertaking given to Congress they can no longer acceptfinancial responsibility for supplies to Italy, The Americans proposed accordingly to make available to the Italian Government the dollar equivalent of UnitedStates&apos; troops&apos; pay in Italy, thus putting the Italians in a position to pay for supplies from the United States.This procedure was objectionable to us. It might imply a breach of theArmistice terms, under which the Italian Government are responsible for the costs of occupation. Further, it would be quite impossible for us to follow theAmerican example and make the sterling equivalent of British troops&apos; pay avail-able to the Italian Government. But it was clearly undesirable that the americans and ourselves should have differing policies towards Italy. we accordingly took the matter up with the Americans and after much argumentthey have agreed that the equivalent of their troops&apos; pay shall only be madeavailable as a conditional advance, without any alteration of Italy&apos;s liabilitiesand without prejudice to the final settlement. On this basis the american proposal, though still in some ways objectionable, can be accepted.This, however, is not the whole story. There is a Presidential election campaign in America and there are 6 million Italian votes distributed over twoor three key States. In order to attract these votes the Americans wish to extend the field of supplies to Italy to cover general economic Rehabilitation. Thusthey propose to treat Italy better than we are treating the smaller Allies. It is unnecessary to develop here the consequences of such action.When I was in Washington I saw Mr. Stettinius and half a dozen officials from the State Department, the Treasury and F.E.A. They were anxious tomake an immediate announcement of their new Italian policy, but agreed to postpone it for ten days so that I could consult the War Cabinet. The ten daysnave now expired, and after considerable discussion with the Foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for War, a telegrain*Tias been agreed and despatched to Washington. It was necessary to act at once since there was very real danger that if we did not send a reply the Americans would go ahead with theirannouncement.The telegram states, first of all, that in no circumstances can we agree atthe present time to any programme of Rehabilitation for Italy. It goes on tosay that we will agree to the Americans making United States troop pay avail-able to the Italian Government, provided (1) That it is made clear that such payment is by way of advance,.and iswithout prejudice to the final settlement with Italy.(2) That no mention is made of Rehabilitation.(3) That it is made clear that the difference between American practice andour own is not a difference of policy but simply one of financialprocedure.R. L.Foreign Office, l$th August, 1944.12483   [2803G]
