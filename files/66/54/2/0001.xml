(44) 452.IQth August, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER ONE YEAR AFTER THE DEFEAT OF GERMANY-DECISIONS REQUIRED FROM HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff.WE note that the directive* on &apos;&apos; Man-power One Year After the defeat of Germany &quot; has been accepted by the War Cabinet, as a general basis for planning. In-order to make the best use of the man-power now at our disposaland to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government of the extent to which military forcesof the size suggested will be sufficient to fulfil our military requirements, we require to seek from His Majesty&apos;s Government a firm statement of their policy on a number of current problems.2. There are, however, even more pressing reasons for seeking an early decision on certain matters. German forces may withdraw from certainterritories now held by them at any time and the collapse of German resistancemay not be long delayed. We cannot plan the military action to be taken in either event until we receive firm guidance.3. We detail below the matters on which we request immediate guidancefrom His Majesty&apos;s Government.Occupational Forces.4. What is His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy with regard to the occupa-tion of Germany and South-East Europe?(a) Germany.The ultimate size of the British force will depend upon : (i) Agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government ofthe United States on the areas to be occupied by British and UnitedStates forces respectively. Our report! has been forwarded to thePrime Minister.(ii) A decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the object of our occupation. Is the purpose of our occupation merely the maintenanceof law and order, and the enforcement of the armistice terms, or isit to be regarded as a &quot; punishment &quot; and patent mark to the Germanpeople of their defeat ? Furthermore, is it proposed to use Germanman-power to any great extent to help our occupational forces, e.g.,as armed gendarmerie?* W.P. (44) 431. f CCS. (44) 619 (0).[27982]
(iii) The extent to which it is intended to make use of the existing central german Government machine. This will be affected if it is decidedto dismember Germany. We hope to submit a report shortly on themilitary implications of the dismemberment problem. It is under-stood that when this report is ready, the Foreign Secretary will submit a paper to the Cabinet on the political aspect of the matter.We are at present examining the extent to which the land forces required for the occupation of Germany may be reduced by themaximum use of air power as a means of enforcing our control, andwe will shortly submit a separate paper on this subject.(b) South-East Europe.Our estimate* of the forces required for the occupation of Austria and part of Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Dodecanese is at present based on certain proposals put forward by the Minister of Statet but not yet confirmed by the War Cabinet. It will be appreciated that these figures refer to one year after the defeat-of Germany and that larger forces will probably be requiredinitially. A decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government on our requirements inSouth-East Europe is required with particular reference to the followingpoints : -(i) Austria and Italy. The share of the respective forces of occupationof Austria to be provided by His Majesty&apos;s Government and theGovernments of the United States and the U.S.S.R. The presentsituation is that the United States have expressed the desire to sendonly a token force, in which case British and Russian forces wouldhave to share the occupation.Do His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that the North-Eastfrontier zone is the only part of Italy which will require military occupation? Eor&quot;Austria and italy  we have provisionally allowed*46-,600 men. -(ii) Hungary. Has it been decided to send any forces of occupation toHungary ? We have provisionally allowed^ a token force of1,200 men.(iii) Bulgaria. What importance do His Majesty&apos;s Government attach tothe occupation of Bulgaria ? The Ministerial Committee onArmistice Terms and Civil Administration % have stated that it isa &quot;probable commitment&quot;; it is a large commitment for which wehave provisionally allowed* 46,600 men.(iv) The   Dodecanese. Confirmation   is   required   from   His   Majesty&apos;sGovernment that we should occupy the Dodecanese. The ministerial committee on Armistice Terms and Civil Administration\ regard this as an &quot; inescapable commitment,&quot; for which we have allowed^2,400 men.Assistance from our European Allies.5. To what extent and in which areas do His Majesty&apos;s Government envisagethe occupation of enemy territory by contingents drawn from our European Allies?Despite the great importance of obtaining maximum contributions from our Allies for the occupation of Germany, we realise that the use of minorAllied forces for the purpose will be restricted by many considerations, politicaland practical. We have put forward our views on the forces which our european Allies might be expected to raise and the methods of equipping them,in a report $ which has been approved by the Armistice and Post-War Committeeand has been forwarded to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. We have provisionallytaken credit for one Allied occupational group in the British zone being availableone&apos;year after the defeat of Germany.6. To what extent do His Majesty&apos;.s Government consider that our european allies can be expected to contribute forces to the war against Japan?Palestine.7. Has any decision yet been reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government on thefuture of Palestine? If so, at what stage is it proposed to announce our policy?* W.P. (44) 380.% A.C.A. (44), 5th Meeting.f A.C.A. (44) 23.g CCS. (44) 120.
It will be remembered that when we examined the scheme* now underconsideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government, we recommended : t(i) That no announcement should be made until after the defeat ofGermany.(ii) That authority should be given for the employment of British and indian troops in Palestine for internal security, if the necessityarose.(iii) That further consideration should be given to the demarcation of frontiers.The extent of our military commitment in the Middle East, which we arenow considering, will be influenced by the future policy as regards the boundaries of Palestine and the adjoining territories.3. Do His Majesty&apos;s Government envisage the maintenance of a striking force available for use in Europe or elsewhere?We have allowed for an air striking force of 30 Heavy Bomber Squadronsdisposed in tbe United Kingdom and Middle East. The function of the force isintended to be -(a) to back up the occupation forces, which, both land and air, have been cutto a minimum on the assumption that such backing would be available;(b) to enforce the observance of the Armistice and Peace Terms by direct action if necessary;(c) to enforce the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Europe generally, incase of need;(d) to deal with any emergency that may arise in Europe or elsewhere.Maintenance of a Striking&quot; Force.We propose! to place in the Middle East a strategic reserve of land forces of166,500 men. As this would be our only Imperial strategic reserve, it might haveto be drawn upon to deal with an emergency in the Middle East, India or Europe,or to take part in the war against Japan.Defence of the United Kingdom.9. Are His Majesty&apos;s Government satisfied that the forces reserved for thedefence of the United Kingdom should be confined to a nucleus for Air Defence ofGreat Britain and for Coast Defence, capable of expansion to full war strength intwo years?Indian Man-Power.10. Can it be assumed that, after the defeat of Germany, the full mobilisa-tion of man-power in India will be continued? Furthermore, what is the policy regarding the employment of Indian divisions for occupational duties in Italy andgarrison duties in Egypt, pending their participation in the war against Japan?Apart from the internal security commitment and forces required for thedefence of India, which remain relatively constant, India is now maintaining; one armoured and twelve infantry divisions outside India. The provisional estimatedrequirement! for Indian formations one year after the defeat of Germany for service outside India is one armoured and eleven infantry divisions. From this itwill be seen that plans are based on the assumption that no substantial demobilisa-tion of Indian man-power will take place.Dominion Contribution.11. To what extent do His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that theDominions should be invited to assist in (a) The occupation of Europe;(b) The war against Japan?* P. (M) (43) 29. f CCS. (44) 62 (O). $ W.P. (44) 3S0.
Preliminary conversations have already taken place with representatives ofAustralia, Canada and New Zealand, but little progress can be made until futurestrategy has been decided.  No approach has been made so far to South Africa.Use of German Man-Power in the War against Japan.12. Is it agreed to make use of German man-power during the war against japan ?  In what capacity and under what conditions ?In estimating the requirements of man-power for employment with theBritish Army, allowance has been made* for the employment of enemy labour to effect a saving of 55,000 personnel.(Signed) A.
