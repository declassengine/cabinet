(44) 476.28th August, 1944.. WAR CABINET.KILLING OF SURVIVORS OF S.S. PELEUS BY U. 852.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.IN my Memorandum of the 12th July (W.P. (44) 388), I brought to theattention of the War Cabinet an atrocity committed against the survivors of atorpedoed Greek Merchant Ship, and raised the question of the treatment of the crew of the U-Boat, and the representations to.be made to the German government about the incident.  The War Cabinet agreed*that (a) action should be taken to retain the whole crew of the U. 852 in theUnited Kingdom, and that care should be taken to separate thosebelieved guilty of this crime from those who had given testimony.Stringent precautions should also be taken to prevent the escape ofany member of the crew;(b) for the present, at any rate, no advantage was seen in any publicdisclosure of information on this matter or in any formal protest to theGerman Government through the Protecting Power. The position could be reconsidered, however, if fresh circumstances arose.2. All the crew of U. 852 except one have been brought to the UnitedKingdom for detention in accordance with the War Cabinefs direction. Theexception is an Engine-Room Rating called Tibbe, who was very seriously injuredwhen the U-Boat was sunk, both legs being paralysed. The Military Authoritiesin the Middle East reported on the 10th August that Tibbe had been seen by the mixed Medical Commission, who had recommended him for immediaterepatriation. The International Red Cross have also interested themselves inTibbe&apos;s case. He is now en route for the United Kingdom, and the question is whether he should be allowed to be repatriated in the forthcoming exchange onthe 8th September, or whether he should be deprived of his right of repatriationon the ground of his connection with a War Criminals case. I am advised that legally the detention of Tibbe in the United Kingdom could be justified onthis ground.3. Tibbe&apos;s condition is reported to be serious, his expectation of life being-given as less than six months. His condition is also expected to deteriorate on the voyage. There is no reason to suppose that Tibbe himself was in any wayimplicated in the atrocity. As he was below deck he could not participate andis not in a position to give evidence of any value. Furthermore, Middle EastAuthorities report that it is most unlikely that Tibbe has any knowledge of ourinvestigation of the atrocity. He has been extremely ill ever since he was captured, and is believed to know nothing of the interrogation which has been proceeding.4. If Tibbe is detained some reason would have to be given, but it wouldbe undesirable to give the true reason as we do not wish the Germans to know thata War Criminals trial is being prepared. We might, however, detain him on theground that his condition is too serious to allow him to travel.[28101]
5. The War Office and Foreign Office have been consulted, both of whomconsider that in view of the facts set out in paragraph 3. Tibbe should be allowedto proceed to Germany. - This will prevent any risk of the Germans makingdifficulties in the forthcoming repatriation, which may happen if Tibbe is not included.6. A further point is that the three Greek survivors have arrived in theUnited Kingdom, and have been found to be fully aware that we hold as prisonersthe men responsible for the atrocity. They will undoubtedly have told the wholestory to the Greek Seamen&apos;s Union, and the Greek Government will soon hear the full facts if they have not already. It is therefore necessary to reconsider the War Cabinet&apos;s conclusion referred to in paragraph 1 (b) above. I proposethat the Foreign Office should approach the Greek Government and suggest a formal protest to the German Government upon the facts as related by the threesurvivors. At the same time they should insist upon the Greek Governmentmaking no reference to the capture of the crew of the U. 852 in the protest,and giving no publicity to the case owing to the risk of reprisals upon allied prisoners in German hands.7.   I accordingly ask the War Cabinet to approve:  (a) the repatriation of Tibbe;(b) reference to the Greek Government on the lines of my preceding para-graph.A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1,28th August. 1944.
