THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 469.26th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE UNITED NATIONS RELIEF AND rehabilitation administration.Directive by the Prime Minister.WE are parties to the U.N.R.R.A. Agreement. Apart from our obligations as one of the founder members, it is in our interest to make this Administrationa success. If it fails, the consequences to us will be far-reaching. Such a failure,moreover, would prejudice our attempts to secure orderly international collabora-tion in other and more important fields, both political and economic, in thepost-war period. We should therefore support this Administration in theungrateful task it has been called into existence to discharge.2. This support must be given in active form. I would therefore ask all departments concerned, both military and civilian, to bear in mind that it is thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to give the fullest possible assistance toU.N.R.R.A. in order to enable the latter to carry out its tasks successfully. that being so, I would ask all departments to co-operate as closely as possible with thestaff of U.N.R.R.A. in the planning and carrying out of civilian relief workin those fields where U.N.R.R.A. will be operating, or in which they have an interest. I would, too, ask departments, if they are approached with the request to release experienced personnel for work with U.N.R.R.A., to do all they canto comply with such requests. It is obviously to our advantage to have as manyBritish subjects as possible working in U.N.R.R.A., and to see that these Britishsubjects are of suitable calibre.3. In agreement with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I have asked the Minister of State, in view of the political implications of the successor failure of U.N.R.R.A., to be responsible for following the activities of this administration and to report progress to me as circumstances demand.W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,26th August, 1944.
