THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of..........TOP SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 479.30th A ugust, 1944.WAR CABINET.SCALE OF ATTACK AGAINST THE UNITED KINGDOM.(Reference : W.M. (44) 90th Conclusions, Item (3) (a).)Report by the Chiefs of Staff.IN this report we appreciate the risk of attack against the United kingdom during the latter part of 1944 by (a) Aircraft.(b) Airborne Forces.(c) Seaborne Forces.A. Attacks by Aircraft.Availability of Forces.2. The bomber force which could be employed for attacks against theUnited Kingdom during this period is unlikely to exceed 275 long-range bombers and 25 fighter-bombers.Likelihood of Attack.3. This bomber force is much more likely to continue, so far as the growingdifficulties of fuel and crew shortage allow, to be employed against targets onthe Continent and in sea-mining. It is possible that the Germans might for some reason or other temporarily divert part of this force from the Continent foroccasional or isolated attacks on the United Kingdom. Such a reason might balfour, for example, black-out regulations were lifted in London. In these circum-stances the Germans, for spite or propaganda reasons, might order an attack against London.Scale of Effort.4. If the Germans did decide temporarily to employ their bomber force against the United Kingdom, the maximum scale of effort would probably notexceed 50 to 60 long-range bomber sorties on any one night. It is extremely unlikely that any sustained or intensive effort would be made.5. The jet-propelled Me. 262 may come into use during the next few months and might be employed as a fighter-bomber, with a radius of action up to200 miles. These aircraft are likely to be employed only by day and might be usedto carry out small-scale &quot; sneak &quot; raids against targets in South-East England.Bomb Load.6. The bomb load carried is likely to average 1-^-2 tons per aircraft, theMe. 262 carrying up to 2,000 lbs.[28114]
Efficiency of Attack.7. A high proportion of the aircraft despatched would probably fail to reach the target area, no concentration would be achieved, and the attacks would not be pressed home.  If the black-out were lifted, concentration would be more effective.Areas of Attack.8. In view of the fighter defences of this country and the general inefficiencyof the German Air Force, attacks would probably be confined to the area southand east of the line Humber to Portsmouth. North and west of that line, and inScotland (including the Orkneys and Shetlands), only isolated flights by two orthree reconnaissance aircraft might be carried out, and no L.R. Bomber activity islikely. The possibility even of isolated small-scale attacks on Northern Irelandand the Faroes is so remote as to be negligible, for reasons of range and of lowpriority of the targets.Probable Targets.9. Owing to the comparatively light scale and probable ineffectiveness of the attacks, especially if directed against comparatively small target areas, london would be the most likely objective for long-range bomber attack. Attacks might also, however, be made on ports south and east of the line Humber to Portsmouth.10. Airfields in South and East England may be attacked by night by up to10 intruder fighter-bombers.B. Attack by Airborne Forces.11. With the development of the situation in France, any serious Germanattempt to disrupt or sabotage Allied operations by parachute troops directed against the United Kingdom can now be ruled out. A spectacular coup, such asa parachute attack against Chequers, is now even more remote than formerly, butin conditions of modern warfare reasonable precautions against some suchoperation must still be maintained. The attempt, if made at all, would be unlikely to exceed one battalion of parachutists (say, 600), carried by some 50 Ju. 52s orHe. Ills, of which possibly a third might with luck reach the target.C. Attack by Seaborne Forces.12. Seaborne raids would now be even more hazardous than before&quot; Overlord.&quot; The ports of departure are diminishing, the fuel required couldless easily be spared, and the demands for naval craft in the Baltic are growingmore exacting. Furthermore, the targets the enemy could attack by seaborneraids would provide him with objectives even less worth while than before:: Overlord.&quot;Conclusions.13. The success of operations in France has strengthened our view that,with the exception of the remote contingency mentioned in paragraph 11 above,sea- and airborne attacks against the United Kingdom will play no part inGerman strategy.14. We believe that the likelihood of air attacks will diminish and willhave been virtually eliminated by the end of the year.(Signed)    -    C. PORTAL.ANDREW CUNNINGHAM.A. E.
