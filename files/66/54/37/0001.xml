(44) 487.    -1st September, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER 1944.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their meeting on the 12th July, 1944, the War Cabinet decided that thereshould be a review of the man-power situation towards the end of August, forthe purpose of fixing intakes into the three Services for the four months from september to December, and of determining final allocations of man-power forthe second six months of the year (W.M. (44) 90th Conclusions, Minute 1). Itwas subsequently decided by the War Cabinet that, for purposes of man-powerplanning, Departments should estimate their man-power requirements for thesecond six months of the year on the assumption that the war with germany would not continue beyond the end of June 1945, and the Service Ministers andthe Minister of Production were invited to submit estimates of requirementson this basis (W.M. (44) 106th Conclusions, Minute 6). The Ministerial Com-mittee on Man-Power have considered, in the light of the general man-power situation, the Memoranda submitted by Ministers since this decision,* and have invited me to report their views to the War Cabinet.Intakes into the Services for September to December.2.   The requirements put forward by the Service Ministers are as follows :  M en. Women.Royal Navy         ......      31.000 3.500Army        .........      75,000 16,000tR.A.F...........       2,0001 nil.Total    ......     108,000 19,500t A.T.S. only. In addition, 2,120 nursing officers and V.A.D.&apos;s are required during thesecond half of 1944.t This is the balance still to be supplied, after allowing for the actual intakes in July and august, of the net intake of 9,700 men and women who are required by the R.A.F. in thesecond half of 1944, on the assumption that the Royal Air Force will not be expanded beyondthe size to be reached by the end of 1944, approved by the War Cabinet. (W.M. (44) 100thConclusions).3. Unless we were prepared to accept the drastic step of wholesalecancellation of deferments of fit young men in the munitions and other essential industries, the maximum numbers which can be made available for the Forcesin the four months from September to December are 69,000 men and 8.400 women.To do even this, while balancing the man-power budget, it will be necessary toincrease the cuts on the munitions industries beyond those provisionally imposed* Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 453).Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P.

in July. We recommend, however, that the full numbers available should be calledupon to meet the needs of the Services, and that the distribution should be asfollows :  .Men. Women.Royal Navy         ...... - 7.000 2,400Army      *......... 50,000* 5,000R.A.F.......... 2,000 nilNursing Services   ......          nil &apos;     1,000Total......      59.000 8,400* Including 6.-100 men from the E.A.F. Deterred List, being the balance of 10,000 to be released from the List for call-up to the Army by the end of October.These intakes are to be regarded as showing the numbers to be actually provided in the months from September to December, and no allowances are to be made forany excess or deficit of intake as compared with allocation during July and august. Thus, the Army would not have any deduction from its allocation of50.000 to balance the excess intake over allocation of about 4,000 men in july and August, nor could they claim any intake of women in addition to the 5,000proposed above as compensation for deficiency of intake below the allocation(amounting to 1,790) during those two months.4. In addition to the intake of 7.000 men for the Royal Navy, we proposethat up to 10.000 men should be given to the Navy to replace an equivalent numberof volunteers for coal-mining who may be released from the Navy.Civil Defence.5. We appreciate the need to maintain the strength of the Civil defence services in the London area so long as it remains the target for flving-bomb androcket attacks. Even in the London region, however, it seems probable that theclanger of such attacks will have disappeared before the end of 1944, and thenew appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff of the risk of air attack against theUnited Kingdom (W.P. (44) 479) justifies a considerable further release of personnel in the less vulnerable areas. Accordingly, we consider that the originalprogamme for the Civil Defence services, involving a net reduction of 50,000 overthe year 1944 (27.000 being non-replacement of ordinary wastage and 23,000 beingactual releases), requires no modification.Sapphj Departments.6. The provisional allocations laid down in July involved the followingreductions in the munitions labour force of the Supply Departments during1944:-Admiralty...............        50,000Ministry of Supply............      170,000M.A.P................      180,000Total   ...      ............      400,0007. The First Lord of the Admiralty states in W.P. (44) 471 that it is notpossible to accept a heavier cut on the Admiralty labour force than the provisionalfigure of 50,000. Since, however, a large part of the force is employed onpreparations for the Japanese war. and since the Prime Ministers Directive(W.P. (44) 431) contemplates a reduction in the size of the Naval forces employedin Stage II, we.consider that a further cut should be possible, and recommendthat the reduction in the Admiralty industrial labour force during 3 944 shouldbe increased to 68,000, giving a labour force of 850,000 at the end of the year.8. The Minister of Supply considers that the proposed reduction of 170,000in their man-power will lead to a short-fall on deliveries to the Services thisyear. The man-power situation is such as to make it necessary that the targetreduction of 170,000 should be achieved, and we are satisfied that, in view ofthe present war situation and of the stocks of munitions already built up, itshould be possible for the necessary cuts to be made without leading to shortages of any items which are really needed. In order to assist the Ministry of supply in carrying out the reduction, and to minimise the risks involved in a short-fall of deliveries, we strongly recommend that the War Office should he asked to review again their requirements with a view to ensuring that their demands
do not lead the Ministry of Supply to retain labour on the production of munitions of which the supplies are already more than sufficient.9. The decision of the War Cabinet that the expansion of the Royal AirForce should not proceed beyond the level reached at the end of 1944 has enableda further reduction of 18.000 to be made in the M.A.P. labour force, giving atotal reduction of 198,000 over the whole year. There should be no difficultyin achieving this.10.   The allocations which we propose are as follows : Reduction to beReduction during       achieved during the1944. second half of 1944Admiralty ...... 68,000 46.500Ministry of Supply      ... 170,000 92,900M.A.P.......... 198,000 118.000Total    ...... 436.000* 257,400* In the provisional allocations for the munitions industries approved in July it was alsocontemplated that the munitions industries working on account of other Government Departments(the home and export trades) could suffer a net reduction of 10,000 during 1044. It now appears,however, that, far from being able to reduce their labour force, these industries have had tohave it increased. It is necessary- to allow an allocation of 13,000 for this, so that the net decreasein the munitions industries as a whole will be 423,000.Industries and Services in Groups II and III.11. The War Cabinet decided in July that industries and services inGroup II should be provided with net increases in their labour forces totalling75,000, as against an original allocation of 123,000. It was also decided thatthe allocations for coal-mining and merchant navy should remain unchanged,while no further increase should be necessary in the allocation for inland transport. In order to carry out these conditions it has been necessary to imposesevere cuts upon the net increases allocated to other industries and services concerned. To some extent these cuts may be justified by the changes in thewar situation but Ave feel bound to stress their severity, and we propose themonly because of the fact that even though it were possible, from the point ofview of the man-power budget, to allocate a larger number, we have consideredthe case of each industry and service and found that it would not in practice be possible to supply the labour needed. Taking all the relevant factors intoaccount, we recommend a distribution of the global allocation of 75,000 inaccordance with the following table : Group II.Numbers to achieve- he suppliedOriginal mentJan-      Revised       in secondAllocation.*     June 1944.

For those industries and services in Group III which require increases in their labour force, the War Cabinet allocated in July a global total of 35,000as compared with an earlier allocation of 49,000. It was also decided that theallocation of 15,000 for nursing and hospitals -should not be subject to any[28129] &apos; b 2
redaction We have examined the needs of the various industries and services concerned, again taking into account the actual possibilities of labour supply, andthe fact that releases from Group III will be far below expectation, we recommendthat the global allocation should be 31,000, distributed as follows : Thousands.Footwear ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 1-5Furniture ...       ...       ...       ... 3Cotton ...      ...      ...      ...      ... other Textiles............. 3Paper ............... 0-2Rubber (including tyres)        ...       ...      ...      3Relief and Contingencies       ...       ...       ...      0-316Xurses and hospital domestics       ......      153113. It was hoped in July that releases from industries and services inGroup III would total 125,000 over the year. We now consider that the maximum number which we can expect to obtain over the year is 95,000. The followingTable shows the basis of this estimate. (It will be noted that two of the industries which were expected to release labour are now shown as requiring net increases.)Thousands.Building and Civil Engineering &quot;..       -70Distributive Trades   ...      ... - 4Leather Goods......       ... - 1-Clothing ...............       -12Woodworking ...      ...      ... --- - 7-5Printing ...      ...      .-- H- 3Building Ancillaries  ...       ... ...       - - -       - . 5Insurance        ...      ... - 0-5Professions      ...      ...       ... t 3Banks    ............ 1-95Most of these releases have already occurred, so that from now on the objectivewill be largely to maintain the present position.14. On the basis of the allocations which we recommend, the man-powerbudget for the year 1944 would turn out as follows : Thousands.Demand.   Supply.Intakes into the Armed Forces ...      ...      332Net reduction in Civil Defence ...       ...       ... 50Net reductions in munitions industries :Admiralty    ............... 68Ministry of Supply          ...       ...       ... 170M.A.P................ 198Other Government Departments (increase) 13Net increase in Group II industries and services       75Group III industries and services (net increase and decrease) ...       ...       ...       ...        31        95Intake into the Armed Forces from the un-occupied       ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 42-Estimated decrease in occupied population asa whole        ...      ...       ...       ...       ...      175626      623There is thus a small deficit of 3,000. We consider that it is reasonable to accept this slight degree of unbalance.
r 9dZ15.   Our recommendations can be summarised as follows(i) Intakes into the Services during the four months from September toDecember should be as follows-: Men. Women.Royal Navy      ............         7,000 2,400Army      ......       .........        50,000 5,000R.A.F................          2,000 nilNursing Services         .........           nil 1,00059,000 8,400These intakes are subject to the following points : (a) There should be no carry-over into this period of surpluses or deficienciesof actual intakes as compared with allocations during July and august.(b) 6,400 of the Army intake of 50,000 are to be obtained from the RAF,Deferred Service List.(c) The Royal Navy should release up to 10,000 volunteers for coal-mining.and receive equivalent compensation in the form of additional newintake.(ii) Reduction of the Civil Defence services should take place in accordancewith the original programme, i.e., a net reduction of 50.000 over the whole year,consisting of 27.000 non-replacement of ordinary wastage and 23.000 actualreleases.(iii) The allocations for munitions labour working for the Supply Depart-ments should be as follows : Year To be achieved1944- July-Dec. 1944-Admiralty ............        68.000        46,500Ministry of Supply     .........      170.000       92.900M.A.P.    ...      .:.      .........      198.000      118.000In order to assist the Ministry of Supply in achieving the target reduction, thereshould be a further review of War Office requirements.(iv) The allocation of man-power for 1944 to industries and services inGroup II should remain at 75,000 and be distributed as shown in the table inparagraph 11. The allocation to those industries and services in Group IIIwhich need increases in their labour force should be fixed at 31.000 and distributed as shown in paragraph 12. For those industries and services in Group IIIwhich are to release labour, the target of releases for the year 1944 should befixed at 95,000 workers.J.
