(44) 470.25th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.RE ALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.AT the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 12th July, 1944 (W.M. (44)90th Conclusions, Minute 2), the War Cabinet decided that publication of thedraft White Paper on the scheme for the reallocation of man-power after the endof hostilities in Europe should stand over until after the Summer Recess.2. I am getting more disturbed, particularly as a result of the successfulprogress of the war each day, that this scheme has not been published and thatthe Forces have no knowledge of what is to happen should the war withGermany end.3. If no announcement is made we shall be badly handicapped in dealingwith both sides of industry, and I urge that the decision should be taken that theGovernments plans should be revealed to the country at the earliest possible moment.4.   It will, of course, be necessary to decide on the method of publication.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service,25th August, 1944.[28087]
