THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECEET.W.P. (44) 463.24:th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER REQUIREMENTS IN THE CIVIL DEFENCE services from JUNE 1944 TO JUNE 1945.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.THE War Cabinet at their meeting on the 14th August, 1944, invited the Service Ministers to submit estimates of man-power requirements for thesecond half of this year and onwards on the assumption that the war withGermany would not continue beyond the 30th June, 1945 (W.M. (44) 106th Con-clusions).In view of my general responsibility for the National Fire Service, thePolice and the Civil Defence (General) Services, I wish to make the following comments : 1. At the meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Man-Power(M.P. (44) 4th Meeting) it was decided that, apart from losses from normalwastage, 11,000 men and women should be released from these Services by theend of September.2. Wastage has been proceeding at about the rate estimated, and arrange-ments have already been made for the quota of releases from the Police and theNational Fire Service; though the full quota may not materialise by the end ofSeptember. The National Fire Service, although not called upon to deal withincendiary raids on any scale, is rendering great assistance in coping withflying-bomb attacks in other directions and in post-raid work. At the instanceof the Ministry of Labour notice of discharge from the General Services willnot become operative until the end of October, unless work has been found for those due to be released in the meantime. Moreover, on account of flying-bomb attacks, it has been necessary to strengthen the Warden Service in London.Should the use of new weapons of the weight foreshadowed materialise in thenumbers estimated at the end of July a substantial increase in this service at any rate will be necessary. It is unlikely, therefore, that the full reductioncontemplated in the General Services, amounting to 4,000, will be achieved bythe end of September.3. A revised estimate of the man-poWer requirements of the three groups of Services for the second half of 1944 cannot be made until (i) a furtherappreciation is received from the Air Ministry of the probable duration and scale of flying-bomb attack : and whether any extension of its geographicalrange is likely; and (ii) some firmer estimate can be given of the date,characteristics, range, weight and scale of rocket attack. Another relevant factoris the prospect of the Allied military occupation of the Pas de Calais and theLow Countries (on the assumption that the extreme range for the effective useof the revenge weapons against this country requires launching sites in these territories); I hope that this prospect will soon be realised.In short, our man-power requirements must be related to the current scale and nature of attack from the air and are not necessarily affected by theassumption now to-be made regarding the duration of the war.4. In the meantime, in accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet(W.M. (44) 90th Conclusions), a scheme is being prepared in my department for the further release of personnel in the less vulnerable areas, to be put intoimmediate operation when the War Cabinet decide that the risk of disbandingthese Services in those areas can be accepted.H.
