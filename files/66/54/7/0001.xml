THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1-944.Copy No.WAR CABINET.SOCIAL INSURANCE.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.1. At their meeting on the 4th July the War Cabinet decided that thepublication of Parts I and II of the White Paper on Social Insurance (W.P. (44)356 and 357) should take place when the House re-assembled after the Recess(W.M. (44) 87th Conclusions).This decision was announced by the Prime Minister, in reply to a question by Mr. Tinker, M.P., on the 11th July, in the following terms : &quot; The Government have completed the preparation of the White Paperembodying their proposals for social insurance generally; for a system of family allowances and for replacing the existing system of workmen&apos;compensation by a new scheme. It is their present intention to publish theWhite Paper in time for it to be discussed when Parliament re-assemblesafter the Recess.&quot;2. Members will expect a reasonable time to study the White Paper before it is debated; and if publication is delayed until the House has re-assembled itwill probably prove difficult to hold the debate within the first three or four weeks after the re-assembly.This might be inconvenient from the point of view of Government business.It might also mean delay in the passage of the Bill to establish a Ministry of social Insurance, and, as I indicated in my memorandum, W.P. (44) 356. theearly establishment of the new Ministry is necessary for the preparation of thecomplicated legislation that will be needed to implement the proposals in theWhite Paper.3. I therefore suggest that the White Paper should be published before theHouse re-assembles (this would be in accord with the terms of the Prime Ministersanswer to Mr. Tinker), and I think that the most convenient date to aim atwould be about a week or ten days before re-assembly. There should be an interval of two or three days between the publication of the two Parts. I askfor authority to proceed accordingly.W.4 Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,22nd Augttst, 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 457.22nd August, 1944.
