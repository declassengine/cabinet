MIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROF STYMJESTY&apos;S GO^G &apos;2 C -R E TV/.p.(hu) U97COPY NO.101U. N. R. R. A.Note by the Minister of StaiThe Cabinet at its meeting on 29th August&quot;1&quot; decidedthat &quot;the position with regard to relief arrangements for italy would require special examination by the War cabinet and is reserved for further consideration.&quot;2. I am about to leave London to attend the second meeting of the Council of U.N.R.R.A. at Montreal where thequestion of relief to Italy will be discussed, and Ishould, therefore, be glad of guidance before mydeparture.3. It will not be possible, in my judgment, to securethe approval of the Council that U.N.R.R.A.   should conductgeneral relief work (including the provision of foodstuffs)in Italy, and I should be glad of confirmation that mycolleagues would not wish me to put forward this proposal,U* Apart, however, from this major question, thereis a minor point concerning U.N.R.R.A.   and Italy on whicha ruling by the Cabinet is also required before Montreal.The Cabinet Conclusions of 29th August are presumably tobe read, notwithstanding the last paragraph, as authorising-ing U.N.R.R.A.   to function in Italy in looking after .displaced persons (excluding enemy nationals) and in fighting epidemics - both questions of interest primarily to the United Nations rather than to Italy.      I should beglad of confirmation on this point.5. The Americans are, however, anxious (andU.N.R.R.A.   is apparently agreeable)  that U.N.R.R.A.   should undertake rather wider functions of more direct benefit toItalians.      The Americans are proposing that U.N.R.R.A.should look after displaced persons of enemy nationality aswell as of Allied nationality in Italy,  and that they shouldalso render assistance in the provision of   medical aid and supplies for the preservation of public health, and in the care of children.      The total programme would not exceed( $50 million,  the bulk of which would be spent on the imported medical supplies.6, The Americans have promised a detailed statement oftheir proposal but this lias not yet been received.      We shall,however, almost certainly   be pressed by the Americans togive our general approval at Montreal to such proposals,and the recent announcement in connection with the PrimeMinister&apos;s visit to Italy will probably increase the pressure on us.+ W.M. 0-lh) 112th Conclusions, Minute 2

7. The American proposals in a way represent a compromise between keeping U.N.R.R,A.  out of Italyaltogether, on the one hand, and allowing it to operate in It ly as if it were Allied territory, onthe other.      It might,  therefore, be useful if theUnited Kingdom delegation to Montreal were to beauthorised to agree that U. iA R. R.-i.  should assist indealing with displaced persons of enemy nationalityin Italy,  if.this proves to be necessary, and shouldalso assist in the matter of public health to theextent suggested by the Americans.8. I should be glad if my colleagues would leave me discretion to reach agreement on these points with the Americans, with a view to common action at the U.N.R.R.A. Council Meeting.      Aspart of that agreement I would try to arrange that neither we nor they would press the issue to a voteif we find that the sentiment of Russia and of thesmaller Allies is very much against U.N.R.R.A.acting in this manner.T)     T- -Li-.
