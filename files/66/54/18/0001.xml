V&quot; OVERLORD &quot; SECURITY.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.1. At their meeting on the 9th August (W.M. (44) 104th Conclusions,Minute 10) the War Cabinet considered a note by me on the following&quot;Overlord&quot; security restrictions: (1) The visitors&apos; ban in the coastal area between the Wash and Southampton;(2) The suspension of the Aer Lingus Teoranta and the Swedish A.B. AeroTransport services; and(3) The restrictions on telephone calls between Great Britain and Ireland.2. In accordance with the War Cabinefs decision at this meeting thequestion of removing the visitors&apos; ban was taken up with Supreme HeadquartersAllied Expeditionary Forces, and the ban was removed on the 25th August.3. With regard to the remaining restrictions, the War Cabinet decided to reconsider in two to three weeks from the 9th August:(a) the removal of the special restrictions on telephone calls between GreatBritain and Ireland; and(&amp;) the resumption of the Aer Lingus Teoranta Service.The War Cabinet took note that the question of the restoration of the SwedishA.B. Aero Transport Service would be considered by the Security Executive withthe Departments concerned.4. Neither Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces nor theSecurity Service raise objections to the removal of the special restrictions ontelephone calls between Great Britain and Ireland or to the resumption of theAer Lingus Teoranta Service. It would seem that now that the special restrictions on travel to Ireland have been removed, these other precautions areunnecessary, although the 100 per cent, censorship of Irish telephone calls will, ofcourse, continue.5. The Security Executive have ascertained that the Departments concerned are strongly in favour of a resumption of the Swedish A.B. Aero TransportService and that neither Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forcesnor the Security Service would object to the restoration of the Service.6.   I accordingly suggest that the War Cabinet should now sanction : (a) the removal of the special restrictions on telephone calls between GreatBritain and Ireland,(b) the resumption of the Aer Lingus Teoranta Service between GreatBritain and Ireland, and(c) the resumption of the Swedish A.B. Aero Transport Service betweenGreat Britain and Sweden.O. L.Ministry of Production,Great George Street, S.W. 1,25th August, 1944.[28084]
