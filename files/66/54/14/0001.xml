AtStettin, two torpedo-boats, seven E/R boats and three sperrbrechers were seen.The enemy is reported to be well advanced with preparations for the thoroughdestruction and obstructive mining of Havre; mines are also likely to be laid in the Seine estuary. On the 20th, reconnaissance located two corvettes, threeescort ships, a sperrbrecher, 12 E/R boats and three landing craft at Havre.U-boats.22. There has been considerable U-boat activity off the Norwegian coast,but- there is as yet no evidence that any large number is at sea in the Atlantic.A number of U-boats are operating on the convoy route to North Russia. Thereare now probably not more than 20 U-boats in the Biscay ports. NineteenU-boats were seen at Gdynia, seven at Hela, 13 at Stettin, two at Rostock, seven(four fitting out) at Danzig, 16 at Kiel, two at Emclen and eight at Bremen.Enemy Attack on Shipping.23. During the week a tanker and another ship in convoy were torpedoedeast of Durban, and a U.S. ship was torpedoed in the Bay.of Fundy.   One ship
previously damaged and in tow, and two small ships in convoys to andthe assault area were sunk in the English Channel. One ship was torpedoevfby E-boats oft&apos; Dungeness but reached port. A U.S. ship was damaged by a mine or torpedo S.W. of the Isle of Wight, and a ship was mined in the assaultarea; the fore part of the ship sank and the after part was beached. A ship in the West 1&apos;ndia docks was seriously damaged by a flying bomb.A report from the Mediterranean indicates that two cargo ships were mined and sunk in the assault area off Provence but no details are yet known.Protection of Seaborne Trade.24. During the week ending the 20th, 733 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 315 were in ocean convoys and421 in British coastal convoys. Two escort-carriers, 30 destroyers (including12 U.S. destroyers), 78 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes, were employed on escort duties. Three homebound convoys, consisting of 135 ships, and fouroutward-bound convoys, of 180 ships, reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.25. Mines have been laid by surface craft in the English Channel, and aircraft have laid mines off Kiel, in the Baltic and off the Biscay ports.Mines have also been laid by aircraft in the Tavoy and Chindwin riversin Burma.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.26. During the week minelaying by one or two enemy aircraft was suspectedoff Hastings and in the Thames estuary. E-boats may have laid mines off Ostend.A dangerous area was declared off the Lizard where six moored mines have been destroyed.Enemy minelaying off the Normandy coast was on a somewhat heavier scalethis week and a small dangerous area has been declared off Arromanches.Thirty-eight ground mines were destroyed and 15 others exploded simultaneously,making a total of 1,102 mines destroyed in this area up to date. The search ofthe Avant Port and Darse Transatlantique at Cherbourg has now beencompleted.It is reported that the enemy has laid mines off Penmarch.27. In the south of France sweeping in the Gulf of St. Tropez was nearlycompleted on the 16th, and 75 moored and 12 magnetic mines have been &quot;destroyed in the Gulf of Frejus. Miuesweepiug is in progress iii the Hade d&apos;H vexes.Mines have been reported off Cape Beiiat.The mine totals are 5,385 ground and 5,661 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.28. Between the 16th and 31st July, six enemy ships totalling 16,090 tons were sunk or captured or became constructive total losses. The total of enemy losses for the month of July amounts to 18 ships of 39,889 tons of which eight of 12,568 tons were in the Mediterranean.29. Recent reconnaissance of the Eastern Baltic has shown that many large and modern cargo ships continue to operate from Danzig and Gdynia; there is,however, a complete absence of small cargo ships at Pillau.30. It is reported that Allied minelaying in the Danube has proved most effective. At one time, traffic was entirely suspended except for ships which were carrying urgent military cargoes. It is estimated that 20 ships and 250 bargeshave been sunk in the river by Allied mines.Swedish Intelligence.31. The Swedish Government, which had already cancelled the insurance of swedish ships trading to German ports on the North Sea, has now withdrawn it also from ships trading to German ports on the Baltic, thus ensuring that infuture no Swedish ships will trade to any German port. This will deprive theGermans of the use of 360,000 tons of cargo shipping which have hitherto been[28075] b2

This will deprive theGermans of the use of 360,000 tons of cargo shipping which have hitherto been[28075] b 2
available to them for trade in the Baltic. The loss to the Germans of this tonnageis far more serious than the destruction and damage caused by the intensivecampaign by the Navy and Air Force during the last 4-i months, which resulted,in the Baltic and Northern waters, in the destruction of 97,000 tons of shipping and in damage to 65.000 tons.MILITARY SITUATION.North-West France.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.32. The past week has seen notable triumphs for Allied arms in northern france. The main fighting strength of the German Seventh Army has been broken; the Normandy pocket has been liquidated; a bridgehead has been wonand held across the Seine, and Paris has been occupied by French Forces of theInterior.12th U.S. A rmy Group.33. The encircling drive by the Third U.S. Army has developed swiftlyduring the past week. &quot; In addition to driving northwards behind the Germanpositions in Normandy, advances have been made eastwards to Orleans and to theRiver Seine where, fifty miles south of Paris between Fontainebleau andMontaigis, an armoured column has penetrated 15 miles to the east of Sens.Twenty-five miles N.W. of the capital a passage has been forced across the RiverSeine at Mantes-Gassicourt. In spite of repeated enemy counter-attacks thisbridgehead is now firmly established and two strong bridges have been constructedover the river.From the area of Mantes-Gassicourt, the main U.S. advance has continuednorthwards west of the river on a broad front and at great speed. Gaillon, Evreuxand Conche were captured by the 22nd and contact established with British forces on the left flank at Laigle. ; This advance was maintained on the following day when forward troops reached Elbeuf some 10 miles south of Rouen.Meanwhile forces of the First U.S. Army have been engaged in assisting withthe liquidation of the Normandy pocket.With the arrival of U.S. forces near the outskirts of Paris, a general uprisingof the French Forces of the Interior took place within the city and a communique issued from General Koenig&apos;s headquarters has announced its liberation. Frencharmoured forces are now entering the city.21st Army Group..34. During the week the Second British Army has been engaged in the liquidation of the Normandy pocket.After reaching the general line Conde Sur Noireau-Flers on the 16th, Britishtroops, despite heavy fighting and delays caused by enemy demolitions and mine-fields, pushed deep thrusts into the pocket from three sides, and gradualhmopped up the disorganised remnants of the enemy. Fierce fighting, very heavy artillery fire, and our air attacks, created conditions of frightful destructionand carnage.On the east side of the pocket, very heavy fighting took place during the closing of the Falaise-Argentan gap. On the 17th the Canadians capturedFalaise, which to the last was bitterly contested by the enemy, and a day laterPolish armour and French armour made the first contact across the gap in thearea south of Trun.By the 20th, the gap was firmly closed, and during the next few days therewas furious fighting in the area of Chambois, as the enemy made desperateattempts to extricate his trapped divisions by attacks both from within and from outside the pocket. These attacks were successfully held and the pocket was finally eliminated on the 22nd. It has not yet been possible to make a tally ofthe enemy dead and prisoners, but it is known that the proportion of dead isvery high.Since the elimination of this pocket, the Second British and First CanadianArmies have pressed forward on a wide front towards the Seine, and by the23rd, the leading troops of these armies were on a general line Verheuil-St. Neubourg-Orbec-River Touques.On the right flank British troops have made contact with U.S. troops driving-north, and the position of the enemy left west of the Seine is precarious.
Southern France.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)35. Within 24 hours the Allied landing in Southern France was beyond alldanger of repulse. A U.S. Corps, operating against only slight resistance, movedwest from its beaches across the high ground towards the valleys of the RiverArgens and Real Martin, and a firm perimeter, some 15 miles deep, had been secured by the 17th; Draguignan, Frejus, Le Luc and Carnoules were allcaptured, and in the south, Bonnes was threatened.From this perimeter, the task of exploitation was pushed rapidly forward.Northwards, a Task Force entered Casteilane on the 18th, the following dayelements reached the River Durance south of St. Auban, and on the 21st. itentered Gap. U.S. infantry are now operating in this sector, with advance unitsprobing towards Grenoble (which they are reported to have entered on the 23rd),and westwards in the general direction of Valence and Montelimar.In the centre, U.S. forces were directed towards Pertius and Aix. Opposi-tion was met east of Brignoles and there was some delay until the town fell onthe 19th, but from there movement has been rapid and Aix was captured thenext day. Forces are now approaching Apt and patrols have reached the main road from Marseilles to Avignon between Salon and La Fare.The French, under General Larminat, began taking over responsibility forthe coastal sector on the 19th, and at once launched attacks against Toulon from north and east. Progress has proved difficult against determined resistance butthe city is now isolated. Ilyeres was taken on the 22nd. French armour and infantry, having passed north of Toulon, are now closing in on Marseilles.16,500 prisoners had been captured up to noon on the 22nd.Russo-German Campaign.Northern Sector.36. The Russians advancing from the Lake Pskov area have cut the railwayTartu-Valka, the only rail link between Tallinn and Riga.Farther south, the Russians have made more progress to within 60 miles of Riga on the east. West of Riga, howrever, German counter-attacks led to therecapture of Tukums, thus restoring land contact with the German forces north of that city.Central Sector.37. W.S.W. of Kovno, Russian forces reached the borders of East Prussia,where they are meeting stiff opposition.West and S.W. of Bialystok, the Russians have advanced to a point 15 miles.S.E. of Lomza and are established on the Bug along a 40-mile stretch N.E.of Warsaw.It is now clear that the Russians hold bridgeheads across the Vistula30 miles south of Warsaw and just south of Deblin. During the week they havebeen attacking from those bridgeheads and also from their larger bridgeheadN.E. of Cracow, but no very substantial progress has been reported.Southern Sector.38. The main news of the week has been the opening of a double russian offensive in this sector. One Russian force, pushing southwards between therivers Siret and Pruth, has captured Jassy and advanced to a point 38 miles.south of the town. Another force, advancing from small bridgeheads across thelower Dniester, has cut the railways Tighina-Barlad and Bucaz-Barlad and isnow only 60 miles N.E. of Galatz.General.39. After a relative pause of three weeks, due partly to German counter-attacks and partly to the Russian need to re-group and reorganise their L. of C.after five weeks of rapid advances along the whole front from&quot;the Gulf of Finlandto the Carpathians, the Russians now appear to be resuming their offensive atseveral points. In particular, they have launched new attacks in Rumaniapresumably in order to exploit the possible German weakness resulting from thetransfer of German forces from this sector to the Central Sector of the russian front.Italy.40. On the 18th, Polish and Italian troops re-opened their offensive inthe Adriatic sector.   By the 23rd, Polish troops had established themselves on
the south bank of the River Metauro from its mouth to a point some three miles to the east of Fossombrone.On the left of the Poles, Italian troops have pushed forward from Frontone;Pergola was occupied during the early part of the period under review, and onthe 23rd, the towns of Aqualagna and Cagli were entered without opposition.Indian troops have made slight advances in the mountainous country tothe north of Subbiano. Elsewhere along the front activity has been confined tovigorous patrol work.Little information has been received as to the situation in Florence.Yugoslavia.4-1. The German drive westwards into Montenegro lias continued againstlittle or no Partisan resistance and the Germans, having entered Kolasin (70 milesX.E. of Dubrovnik), have captured the landing ground at Negobudje 20 milesfurther N.W.In Serbia, however, the Partisans have considerably extended the area under their control. On the 18th they captured the important Bulgarian base of Lebane(30 miles south of Nis). They have also carried out extensive demolitions on theNis-Skoplje railway and on the 11th, captured the town of Boljevac (40 miles north of Nis).In western Bosnia the Partisans have re-captured the important road centre of Mrkojicgrad.Burma.Chin Hills and Chindwin.42. Leading elements of our troops advancing&apos; south down the Imphal-Tiddim Road have reached a point five miles south of the Burma border againstslight enemy resistance.In the Tamil area our troops are within six miles of Sittaung on the chindwin river and have occupied the village of Witok, 1G miles south of Tamuon the Tamu-Kalewa road.North Burma.43. , Allied forces have captured a village four miles N.E. of Pinbaw onthe Myitkyina-Katha railway, whilst other elements of our forces have reachedKazu, 20 miles south of Myitkyina on the Myitkyina-Bhamo road.Pacific Theatre.New Guinea.44. All organised resistance to the U.S. forces 16 miles east of Aitapeceased on the 9th. Enemy casualties to this date in this area amount to 7,625killed and 94 captured.Vogelkop.45. Further U.S. landings have been made in the area of Sansapore inthe Vogelkop peninsula against negligible enemy resistance. Japanese located in the peninsula appear to be making south-westwards towards the southernapex of Geelvink Bay.AIR SITUATION.General Review.46, Although offensive operations by Allied aircraft were considerablyrestricted by bad weather conditions, strong support was given to Allied troopsin northern France and heavy attacks were made on communications in France,on Bremen and on a synthetic oil plant in the Ruhr.There was an increase in the number of flying-bombs launched against theUnited Kingdom.M.A.A.F. strategic bombers attacked oil targets over a wide area in southern and eastern Europe.
United Kingdom.47. Flying bomb attacks are reported under &quot;Enemy Activity and home security.&quot; Activity against flying bombs was considerably reduced owingto bad weather, which primarily affected the fighters: 1,741 sorties were flown and 77 flying bombs destroyed. Despite the weather, however, A.A.achieved the remarkable figure of 303 destroyed; in addition to 20 by balloons.For the month of July, fighters flew a total of 9,634 sorties and destroyed921 F.Bs. 2,240 IT.A. guns were deployed at the 2nd August, and during july.A. destroyed 365 F.Bs. The curtain of balloons at the 31st July totalled1,969 and 119 F.Bs. were destroyed in the month.On one night of the week, ten enemy aircraft operated, during flying bombactivity, off the east coast and Thames estuary. On the following night, aDo. 217 crossed the south coast and was shot down by A.A. over Kent.Home Waters.48. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 1,082 sorties during theweek; six aircraft are missing.Attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Dover Strait and in the Bavof Biscay. On the night of the 17th/18th, two E/R boats exploded and a thirdwas set on fire off Cap Gris Nez, and on the following night, two furtherE/R boats were probably sunk off Gravelines and two minesweepers damagedoff St. Nazaire.On the 20th, two armed trawlers in harbour at Les Sables-d&apos;01onne were seton fire,&apos; and on the following day two minesweepers and an auxiliary were set on fire off Le Verdon.Bomber Command aircraft laid 120 sea-mines.Western Front.49. A total of 17,020 sorties were flown during the week and 9,121 tons of bombs were dropped.enemy.y long-range bomber activity was generally on a lower scale than previously, the average scale of effort being 7Q sorties per night. Reconnaissanceactivity remained on a very low level and was almost entirety confined to weather-reporting sorties. Fighter operations were a little more intense than last weekand the main task appeared to be to give direct support to the German Armyin its. struggle to disengage to the east.Enemy losses in combat were 97 aircraft destroyed, three probably destroyed and 41 damaged; 24 Allied bombers and 137 fighters and fighter-bombers are missing.France and Belgium.^50. Although operations were considerably hampered by unfavourable weather, the Allied air forces again gave full support to Allied troops in northern france, not only by heavy attacks on enemy communications, concentrations oftroops and armour, dumps and other targets in the battle area but also on railways, roads, bridges and barges in north-eastern France and Belgium.The damage caused to enemy transport was very considerable, and itsextent may be gauged by the results achieved by Spitfires, Typhoons, Mustangs.Thunderbolts and Lightnings on the 18th, when, in fine weather, about 1,120M.T. vehicles were destroyed and a further 1,300 probably destroyed or damaged.The attacks carried out by Mosquitoes and Mitchells on the following night oncrossings over the Seine and on enemy movements west of the river were, accord-ing to reports, some of the most successful since the landing and claims were toonumerous to assess accurately.About ten bridges over the River Risle were bombed by Marauders andBostons and seven over the River Meuse by Fortresses. Attacks were also madeon several railway centres, including the one at Connantre (70 miles E. of Paris),which was bombed by Halifaxes and Laneasters; a preliminary interpretation of photographs shows a heavy concentration of bombing in the western portionof the yard.In the above attacks, about 3,800 tons of bombs were dropped and hundreds of rocket projectiles fired.Among other targets attacked were fuel depots in France and Belgium(1,560 tons), a flying bomb supply depot near Paris, and eight launching sites(878 tons), four airfields in eastern and north-eastern France (650 tons), shipping at Brest (265 tons), U-boat pens at La Pallice (118 tons) and an aero-engineworks near Metz (144 tons).* The results of some of the attacks referred to above are given in Appendix YIT.
Germany.51. Bomber Command aircraft made heavy attacks on Bremen and on the synthetic oil plant at Sterkrade (near Essen) on the night of the 18th/ 19th, aboutf,200 tons being dropped on the former and 750 tons on the latter. A Mosquitowhich flew over Bremen about 40 minutes after the attack found an area of veryintense and unbroken fires covering an area of four by one-and-a-half miles withthick smoke rising to 23,000 feet (see Appendix VII). * At Sterkrade, the markerswere accurately placed and there was a good concentration of bombing.In addition, small-scale attacks were made on Berlin, Mannheim, Cologne,Harburg (near Hamburg) and on synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr.Mediterranean Front.52. During the week ended dawn on the 22nd, Allied aircraft of theM.A.A.F. flew a total of 12.970 sorties, of which 2,442 were by heavy bombers;8.216 tons of bombs were dropped. 115 Allied aircraft are missing and 21 enemy aircraft were destroyed.In the South of France and in Italy, the Tactical Air Force maintained heavy attacks on communications and military targets. The M.A.A.F. strategic bombers attacked oil installations in Southern Germany, Austria. Poland, Hungary,Slovakia and Rumania; a number of other targets were also attacked in SouthernEurope.*South of France.53. Enemy communications provided the principal targets for the medium,light and fighter-bombers: many railway bridges were attacked and a number of successful results achieved. At least 215 units of rolling stock, 21 bowser trucks,32 locomotives and 220 M.T. were destroyed; in addition a great number of these units were damaged. Numerous hits wrere obtained on road bridges and approaches and storage dumps. Close support was provided in the fighting areas for Alliedground forces and many hits obtained on enemy gun positions. Light-scaleattacks were maintained on small harbours along the coast. Valence airfield was attacked and fighters flew defensive patrols over the beachhead. Everynight light bombers carried out armed reconnaissances over the French/Italiancoastal districts, attacking roads, harbours and transport. In these operationsAllied aircraft flew a total of 2,226 offensive sorties; enemy fighter reaction was negligible.o   oSmall-scale operations by enemy bombers were carried out, with radio-euntrolled bombs, against the landing areas.Italy.54. In this area. communications were the principal targets. A heavy attack, by fighter-bombers, was made on the railway centre at Alessandria, and several smaller-scale attacks were made on similar targets. Two spans of a bridgeat Parma were destroyed and a number of other bridges hit. Roads and railwaytracks were cut in many places and several locomotives and many M.T. destroyed.In the only operation carried out, in this area, by heavy bombers, Liberatorsdropped 211 tons on the railway bridge at Ferrara. ! Close support was providedfor Allied ground forces, particularly in the Adriatic sector. In these operationsAllied aircraft flew a total of 2,327 offensive sorties.- Yugoslavia and AIbania.55. In two attacks, heavy bombers dropped 319 tons on Nis airfield. other aircraft effectively attacked oil storage cisterns, railways, roads, rolling stockandM.T.S. and E. Germany and Austria.56. A night attack, by a mixed force of bombers, was made on the SteyrDaimler Puch works; 201 tons were dropped.Heavy bombers of the M.A.A.F. dropped 526 tons on three oil refineries in theBreslau area, 333 tons on an oil storage depot at Lobau (Vienna), and 324 tons on two oil refineries in the Vienna area, where an aircraft factory (227 tons), thesouth industrial district (167 tons), and Markersclorf airfield (320 tons) were also attacked. From these operations 51 bombers and 7 fighters are missing, 99 enemy aircraft were shot down.
Rumania and Bulgaria.57. During the week, attacks were made by the Strategic Air Force on oil refineries in the Ploesti area; a total of 1,400 tons of bombs was dropped. Photo-graphs, taken subsequently, showed that a great deal of fresh damage had beendone and many cisterns wrecked. Twenty-six heavy bombers and three Welling-tons are missing from these operations.The airfield at Alibunar (35 miles N.E. of Belgrade) was attacked by89 Liberators, which dropped 155 tons.Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.58. In Poland, M.A.A.F. strategic bombers attacked two oil refineries, with good results, in the Cracow area (488 tons) and in Slovakia, the oil refinery atDubova (158 tons). At Dubova, two of four large crude oil cisterns and 24smaller ones were left burning.In Hungary, the railway centre at Szolnok (233 tons), two airfields (357 tons),and an oil refinery (171 tons) were attacked. Good coverage was obtained at the oil refinery and the airfields; at Szolnok very severe damage was done and at least400 units of rolling stock wrecked.Russia.59. During the week the Russian Air Foi*ce has maintained a high scale of activity, of which a large proportion has been by ground-attack aircraft. Thelong-range bomber force, in the absence of reports, is assumed to have been almostentirely inactive.It is estimated that the German Air Force now has some 1,800 aircraft onthe Eastern Front, of which over 1,000 are in the Baltic States, East Prussiaand Northern Poland.Burma.60. Allied aircraft, for the week ended the 22nd, flew a total of 2,075sorties, of which 1,215 were by bombers and fighter-bombers. Transport aircraft flew 1,316 sorties, carrying 2,976 tons, 3,827 men and evacuated 1,901 casualties and 2,272 men.The principal Allied air activity has been in the Chindwin-Manipur area,where many types of military targets have been attacked and close supportprovided for Allied ground forces. Medium bombers have continued to laymines in the Chindwin River. In central Burma many effective attacks weremade on railways, roads, bridges and airfields. Liberators laid mines in theTavoy River and fighter-bombers destroyed many river craft in the Arakan.China Zone.61. Allied aircraft for the week ended dawn on the 21st, flew a total of842 sorties, of which 649 were by bombers and fighter-bombers. Thirteen allied aircraft were lost and 27 enemy aircraft destroyed.

In attacks on storage areas at Yochow and70 miles to the north at Puchi, very severe damage was done. At Sunghai(115 miles S.S.W. of Changsha) and at Kiukiang (30 miles S.E. of Hankow)extensive damage resulted from Allied air attacks.A Liberator obtained 4 hits on a cruiser, which subsequently sank, 100 miles.N.E. of Hong Kong. In the South China Sea a number of small vessels were sunk.  Heavy bombers attacked naval bases at Mako and Hong Kong.Pacific.New Guinea and Halmahera.62.   In Dutch New Guinea, Allied aircraft made fairly heavy attacks onarumerous targets, especially in the Sarmi, Babo, Manokwari and Geelvink Bayareas.   In the Sarmi area a series of successful attacks were made on enemy[28075] c

The Portable Harbours of Normandy.At the Quebec Conference, when plans were prepared for the assault uponNormandy, it was decided to build artificial harbours on the French coast inorder to ensure the essential requirements of the army when landed. Two siteswere tentatively chosen, one at Saint Laurent and the other at Arromanches, wherethe Calvados Reef, offshore, already gave some shelter from the north-east. ByJanuary 1944 definite requirements could be stated for the two ports. Two deep-water ports were needed: and between them they were to be able to discharge around dozen of liberty ships concurrently, without interruption from the weather.Many other ships were to be anchored outside and discharged to shore by barges and light craft when the weather allowed. It was also required that about thirtycoasters should discharge direct on to piers in all weathers. At other piers, land-ing ships were to discharge their tanks and M.T. vehicles dry-shod and at thegreatest possible rate. Finally shelter was needed for all the thousands of landing craft along the whole 50-mile length of the beaches, since these could not withdraw to England at the onset of heavy weather. It soon became clear that this lastrequirement could not be met by the provision of the two main harbours, and itwas therefore decided to lay five separate breakwaters, in shallow water, for thecomfort of small craft in bad weather. These breakwaters would, of course,have to be laid almost as soon as the assault began.In the final plan, two of the shelter breakwaters were combined into the design of the two deep-water harbours. A total of 24.000 feet (4 miles) of block-ships was required for these shallow-water harbours. The Allied merchant fleetswere combed for those ships which had proved least economical to run. Theblockships were, however, required to steam to their&quot; sinking positions, since thebreakwaters had to be complete shortly after D-day. &apos;With U.S. assistance, over 100 large tugs were assembled together with alarge HQ. for their servicing, repair and general organisation. The tugs workedcontinuously for two months before D-day, assembling equipment&quot;; and on D-day and after they had not only to assemble the portable harbours, but also to towammunition barges, lighters, constructional stores, and all the equipment of agreat war-harbour.On the afternoon of 7th June, when the areas had been carefully swept,three old warships and 53 other ships, specially ballasted, fitted with scuttlingcharges and otherwise made ready, steamed into their allotted positions. A fourthlarge worship, the Courbet, had to be towed there. When scuttled stem to sternin their berths they formed some four miles of breakwater, behind which landing craft using the beaches could shelter. By p.m. on 9th June this shelter was in being off St. Martin de Varreville and St. Laurent (for the First Army) and offLe Hamel, east of x\rromanehes, Courseulles and Ouistreham (for the SecondArmy). Of these four miles, more than 2.000 feet were formed by the fourwarships. The merchantmen varied between 366 and 450 ft. in length. All wereballasted so as to reach their berths in two fathoms charted depth. They were then sunk by scuttling charges in such a way as to leave about two feet of free-board, not counting bulwarks, between their &apos;; islands&quot; at normal high water.Their superstructures are all armed with Bofors A.A. guns from which a formidable-able barrage can be put up.While these ships were being sunk the first tows left England with elementsfor the construction of the cleep-water harbours. These were breakwater-units vast concrete caissons which could be toweel into position and sunk by the openingof special sinking valves. All these caissons were 200 feet in length : theirheight and width varied with the positions which they were to take up : thelargest (weighing 6,000 tons each) were 60 x 60 feet, the smallest, 30 x 30 feet.They numbered in all about 150, and were built, some in dry-docks and otherson side-launching ways on suitable beaches in southern England. The latter were launched when half-built, and completed when afloat.For the inside of the harbours many miles of floating roadway were made,designed to lead out from the beaches to special pier-heads. The pier-headpontoons were of vast proportions. At each corner they had an 80-ft. pilewhich could be raised or lowered. On arrival these piles were driven down intothe sea-bed, and the pontoons slid up and down them with the 24-ft. rise andfall of the tide. The roadways between the pier-heads and the shore were made from steel girder-bridges in 80-ft. spans, between floating pontoons. Eachroadway was towed over in sections of six spans, and had a sloping ramp at itsshore-end.
In addition to the protection given by the blockships, another mile offloating breakwater was provided oft&apos; each port. This was made of steel units,200 feet in length, cruciform in section and 25-ft. deep. About six of their25 feet showed above the surface. They have wide flanges and are water-ballasted. They acted as an effective damper on the weaves in fairly roughweather but they could not withstand the unprecedented weather of 19th, 20thand 21st June. At Arromanches the Calvados Reef gave good protection to theportable harbour from the north-east. At St. Laurent, however, there was somuch damage that (since the capture of Cherbourg had very greatly diminishedits importance) no attempt was made to reconstruct the deep-water caissonbreakwater anld the material which could still be used was concentrated atArromanches.The immense and well-equipped harbour now in existence off Arromancheshas amply fulfilled its purpose.By the 9th July the target figure of 6,000 tons discharged daily had been achieved although the L.S.T. pier was not completed till 17th July, and only two of the three stores-piers were then in operation. During the gale ofI9th/21st June the blockship breakwaters allowed thousands of landing craftto ride out the gale under their lee; some discharge of essential stores continued,even at that time. The harbour is now two miles long, with  four pierssurrounded by breakwaters with three entrances. Seven liberty ships and agreat many coasters can be berthed inside; some of these unload alongside thepiers, others into amphibious carriers of which up to 400 run continuously fromthe ships to the top of the cliffs on each side of Arromanches. The harbouralso shelters depot and repair ships, a floating dock, and the coastal craft whichconstantly engage enemy light forces which put out from Havre.APPENDICES I, II and III will be published periodically.APPENDIX IY.Enemy Merchant Shipping losses as assessed to 31st July were as follows :-Sunk, CapturedOr Constructive ISeriouslyTJU a-m a e c!.Damaged.Total.j                             1 i    Gross    ! xt NO.           rp   ^         I   NO. j    ions.    1				Gross    I x-rr.      0            NO. ions.
