(44) 466. v\25th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.INSTRUCTIONS TO UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATION TO second session OF U.N.R.R.A. COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Minister of State.THE Council of U.N.R.R.A. assembles for its Second Session on the15th September in Montreal. This Session of the Council was to have been heldin June, but was postponed on account of the travel ban. As the United Kingdommember of the Council. I shall be attending this Session together with theMinister Resident in Washington for Supply, who acts as my alternate on theCentral Committee of U.N.R.R.A. and represents the United Kingdom on theCommittee on Supplies. The Departments concerned have nominated officials to accompany me.2. In asking my colleagues to approve the general line to be taken by theUnited Kingdom Delegation at the U.N.R.R.A. Council. I think it unnecessary to rehearse all the various items on the agenda. Several of these are formal in character or involve no points of sufficient substance for Cabinet consideration.There are, however, a few questions upon which I am anxious to know the viewsof my colleagues since, even if they are not raised specifically, they must underlymuch of the discussions which I expect will take place at Montreal.3. The meeting at Montreal will be held at a critical time for U.N.R.R.A.Whereas the first meeting at Atlantic City last November was mainly concernedwith the making of plans for the future and the establishment of proceduresintended to facilitate the orderly distribution of relief supplies to the liberated countries, this Council will take place when large areas will already have beenrecovered from the enemy and when several, if not all, of the European allies will be counting on their countries being liberated in the very near future-Interest will therefore naturally be centred on practical matters and on thepresent and the immediate future and on the relief supplies and services whichthe liberated areas can actually count on receiving from or through the assistanceof U.N.R.R.A. during the next six months or so. Several of the paying allies are already distinctly sceptical of U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s ability to help them and are showing signs of feeling that they would stand a better chance of obtaining supplies if they were to act independently instead of through the U.N.R.R.A.machinery. Unless the U.N.R.R.A. administration at Montreal takes a construc-tive line and indicates clearly that U.N.R.R.A. will be in a position to provide some definite measure of assistance to.the liberated countries in the next fewmonths, there is, I think, a real risk that U.N.R.R.A. will break up and that several of the paying allies will decide to go their own ways. This, in my opinion,would be most unfortunate not only from the general but from the UnitedKingdom point of view. Not only would it mean the break-down, almost at the outset, of the first attempt to set up an international post-war organisation a break-down for which we, as one of the authors of the scheme, would probablyget more than our fair share of the blame; it would mean the start of a scramble onthe part of the paying allies for the limited quantities of supplies available which,at best, would handicap the smooth working of the Combined Boards and at worstprejudice our own prospects of obtaining supplies from overseas or of preventingprices getting out of hand; it would mean the increase of pressure on ourselves12492   [280811
for assistance from the non-paying allies, pressure which we might find it difficultto resist; and it would make it more difficult to have handled on an internationalbasis the overall problems of displaced persons and health which we had hoped to see entrusted to U.N.R.R.A. We ought, therefore, I feel convinced, in ourown interests to do everything we can at Montreal to uphold and strengthen theposition of U.N.R.R.A. within its functions as agreed at Atlantic City and toencourage the Administration to take a line calculated to gain rather than lose the confidence of the allies. This is particularly necessary in view of the tendency of Governor Lehman to adopt almost a defeatist attitude in regard to the extentto which U.N.RRA. can assist the liberated countries.4. The financial position of U.N.R.R.A. When I visited Washingtonrecently I discovered that the Director-General and some of his staff were inclined to adopt a highly pessimistic attitude on the question whetherU.N.R.R.A. would have sufficient financial resources to discharge the taskallotted to it. As a result he was proposing to inform the member governments that U.N.R.R.A. eculd only cover a much narrower field than that envisaged inthe U.X.R.R.A. Agreement and at Atlantic City. A further consequence of thisSfenerai attitude&apos;was that Governor Lehman was extremelv hesitant to take onany immediate tasks. He was. for instance, most reluctant to assume responsi-bility for looking after Yugoslavs being evacuated from Italy to North Africa.In discussion with him I took the line that at the present time he had no informa-tion which indicated clearly what the cost of a programme of operations on thelines conceived at Atlantic City would be and that (even if he had) for him tosay now that he could not carry out such a programme would be to invite the member governments to go their own ways rather than, to act in concert indealing with the relief problem. I formed the impression &quot;that Mr. Lehman hasallowed his financial difficulties to loom nr.necessarily large in his mind. He has probably not fully seized, for instance, the extent to which the United kingdom has improvised &quot;a vast war effort and improved the standard of national nutritionon the basis of imports of only a fraction of pre-war : nor the rapidity withwhich (to judge from 1919-20) Europe, if properly encouraged to help itself,can recover by various means some ability to pay for imports. I told him that, if at a later date it became clear that the work to be done was larger thanthe funds would cover, he stood a better chance of securing more money ifU.N.R.R.A. had efficiently carried out its task in the meantime than he would if he had held back from present opportunities in order to conserve his resources for the doubtful liabilities of the future. The State Department strongly supported this line and it was clear that they felt that if U.N.R.R.A. made agood showing from the outset the chances of obtaining further funds later onfrom the United States would be reasonably good. In these discussions I wascareful to emphasise, both to Governor Lehman and to the United states authorities, that the United Kingdom would find it very difficult to providegoods and services for U.N.RR.A. to implement the financial contribution wehad already set aside and that there could therefore be no question of ouragreeing, or even implying, that at a future date we would be ready to agree toput up further money for U.N.R.R.A. I hope my colleagues will agree that itAvas right for us to dissuade Governor Lehman from trying to strike a balanceat this stage between present assets and future liabilities and to encourage himto go ahead with those things he has to do, and that they will agree that weshould pursue the same line at Montreal.5. Consumption Standards. At the Montreal meeting member governments will have presented to them a report by the Director-General on the wrork of theU.N.R.R.A. organisation since the first meeting of the Council nine months ago.This report, of which we have seen a draft, contains a section on the supplies which U.N.R.R.A. has been trying to obtain for relief purposes. The requestssubmitted by U.N.R.R.A. to the Combined Boards for allocations are recited,together with the replies received from the Combined Boards. These replies aregenerally unsatisfactory from the point of view of U.N.R.R.A.. and I understandthat the Combined Boards themselves are now preparing a statement showingwhy they have found it impossible to make more extensive provision to meetU.N.R.R.A. requirements. This statement will show that the supplies requested by the military authorities for relief during the military period of responsi-bility have in many cases taken up&quot;all the supplies which were available overand above the needs of the fighting forces and the civilian populations of theworld outside Axis,control. It is to be hoped that this statement of the quantityof supplies provided for the military period of relief will go some way towards
explaining why U.N.R.R.A. itself has not been able to make greater provisionfor the non-paying allies in the post-military period and why the paying allieshave not been able to make further progress themselves with the procurementthey wish to initiate. As.I have already said, however, it seems inevitable thatthere will be very considerable pressure from the allies, both paying and non-paying, for some definite indication as to the relief supplies likely to become available to them during the next six months or so. It is, I think, desirablethat the United Kingdom delegation should adopt as sympathetic and construc-tive an attitude as possible towards such pressure from the allies and that weshould, in so far as the matter rests with us, do whatever we properly can to seethat as much satisfaction as practicable is afforded the allies even at the riskof adopting a rather less conservative attitude in respect of certain suppliesthan in the past. Such an attitude on our part especially if a similar linewere taken by the Americans would not only strengthen the position of u.N.R.R.A., but I think make it more difficult for the allies to press for areduction in the consumption of British civilians, so that more supplies couldbe available for relief purposes. If any such pressure does develop. I would propose to make it clear that the British people have been at war for five yearsand are now preparing for fresh efforts to beat Japan; their standards of consump-tion have been reduced as low as they can possibly be reduced; and that we cancontemplate no further reduction since this could only be made at the expenseof our war effort which it is in everyone&apos;s interest to maintain at the highest possible pitch. After an European armistice we shall be obliged to raise ourstandards in certain directions; but while we do so we shall make due provisionfor meeting our relief obligations, and we are prepared to endure some curtail-ment on this account of the relaxations which we.allow to ourselves. Such astatement might well focus attention on the American levels of consumption, butthat would, I think, be no bad thing since, even though no action to reducethese levels may be practicable before November, some reduction in them maybe necessary before long if adequate supplies are to be available for the liberated areas in Europe and the Far East.6. U.N.R R A. and enemy countries. There is also the question of the role to be performed by U.N.R.R.A. in enemy or ex-enemy countries. AtAtlantic City we attempted to keep the door open for U.N.R.R.A. to conductoperations in enemy or ex-enemy territories if circumstances showed that thiswould subsequently be desirable -since among other considerations there wereobvious advantages from the financial point of view in entrusting U.X.R.R.A.with the responsibility of making relief supplies available to enemy countries.The reaction of the European allies was, however, very strongly against thegeneral idea of relief for enemies being provided by U.N.R.R.A., and wordswere inserted in the resolutions adopted at Atlantic City which made itnecessary for the Council to approve any kind of work which it is proposedthat U.N.R.R.A. should undertake in enemy countries. Until recently, bothwe and the Americans, anxious to see it made possible for some of the financial burden for providing relief supplies to enemy countries to be passed on toU.N.R.R.A., had hoped that it might be&apos;possible for the position to be furtherclarified at Montreal. It is now clear, however, that it would be a mistake forus at this time to suggest that U.N.R.R.A. should undertake any general relief work in Italy or elsewhere in enemy or ex-enemy territory for the benefit of theenemy population concerned. The Allied Governments are aware of u.N.R.R.A.&apos;s own fear that its existing financial resources will be insufficient for its work on behalf of the allied peoples, and they would undoubtedly receivevery badly any suggestion at this time that U.N.R.R.A. should spend money on providing goods and services for enemies at the probable expense of the Allies.It will, therefore, I think, be better to try to avoid this issue being raised inits widest form i.e., of U.N.R.R.A. being allowed to undertake the relief of enemy or ex-enemy populations though we should do nothing which would prevent such a development in the future, since if relief becomes necessary eg., for Austria it might well be less costly for us to employ U.N.R.R.A. than any other alternative which would be open to us. There are, however, twoparticular cases affecting enemy countries in which I think it is important toenable U.N.R.R.A. to operate.&quot; U.N.R.R.A. should take over the care andrepatriation of the nationals of the United Nations displaced into enemy territory and function in health matters, e.g.. the control of epidemics whichmight spread through enemy territory across the frontiers into allied countries.Both of these works are primarily for the benefit of the United Nations andnot for the benefit of the enemy, and I think it is clear that in their own interest
the Allies will agree to U.N.R.R.A. being permitted to undertake them. In theparticular case of Italy there is, I think, an immediate task which U.N.R.R.A.might assume in connexion with the care of Yugoslavs arriving across the adriatic. I hope my colleagues will agree that we could support a proposal that U.N.R.R.A. should be authorised to undertake the care and repatriation of displaced persons (other than those of enemy nationality) and the fightingof epidemics in and on the frontiers of enemy territory.It is also very desirable that U.N.R.R.A. should be authorised to arrangefor the evacuation from Allied liberated territory of enemy or ex-enemy nationalswho have been settled in Allied homes. This would be in accordance with theline taken by the Allies at Atlantic City.7. General attitude. The points I have mentioned above are the only onesupon which I think it necessary to trouble my colleagues at this stage. It is always possible, of course, that other questions of importance may arise uponwhich I shall need guidance. In this case I shall have to refer home. On thegeneral issue, however. I take it that my colleagues would wish the UnitedKingdom delegation to make clear in their dealings at Montreal thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to support U.N.R.R.A. to the best oftheir ability. I feel that no other attitude would be consistent with our positionas one of the two original sponsors of U.N.R.R.A. I feel too that, for the reasons give above, if we allowed U.N.R.R.A. to collapse, as it might well do, if not given support and help at this stage, this would be extremely unfortunate forus politically and would cost us dear in money and supplies.R.
