THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.Copy No.WAR CABINET.BLACK-OUT POLICY.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.1. The War Cabinet, on the 31st July, 1944 (W.M. (44) 99th Conclusions,Minute 8), considered the report of the Committee on Black-out Restrictions(W.P. (44) 417), and agreed that no announcement should at that time be made about relaxation of the black-out and that the date and extent of any relaxationshould be considered by the War Cabinet at the end of September. In themeantime the War Cabinet directed that local authorities and other bodies concerned in all parts of the country should be told that they could make preparations for the resumption of street and industrial lighting on the scalesuggested in WP. (44) 417.   This has been done.2. The main proposals of the Committee on Black-out Restrictions were that part of the country north and west of a line roughly St. David&apos;s Head-Bletchley-Goole-Falkirk-Dingwall-Tongue should be considered a &quot; less vulner-able &quot; area within which relaxation of lighting restrictions should be allowed.These relaxations were :  (a) Higher street lighting up to 0-2 foot candles for centrally controlledlighting, and up to 0-02 foot candles for lights which cannot beswitched off on a warning, the lighting to be screened above thehorizontal. 0-2 foot candles compares favourably with much pre-warstreet lighting, and 0-02 foot candles is roughly equivalent to sidestreet lighting.(b) Internal lighting in houses, factories, offices, &amp;c, to be relaxed to a&quot; dim-out &quot; instead of a complete black-out.(c) External lighting for industry should be allowed at a maximum of 1 footcandle for working areas and 0-02 foot candles for movement.(d) Certain improvements in the lighting of side lamps on cars and cyclelamps.3. It was stated at the time that the area then proposed as the &quot; less vulnerable &quot; area was subject to alteration as the war progressed and arrange-ments were suggested in the Committee&apos;s report for including South Wales andSouth-West England in the &quot;less vulnerable &quot; area at a later date.4. Since the Committee reported more than a month ago the war situationin Europe has appreciably improved, and the Report by the Chiefs of Staff onthe &quot; Scale of Attack against the United Kingdom &quot; .(W.P. (44) 479), dated the30th August, 1944, provides a new appreciation of the risk of attack duringthe latter part of 1944.5. I have considered again, in the light of this appreciation, what alteration in the proposals for relaxing the black-out can be made. British Double SummerTime ends on the 17th September, 1944, and it would be desirable, if relaxationsare to be made, that they should be announced before that date, for the black-outis usually most criticised at the end of Double Summer Time.6. The simplest method of relaxation would be to allow the whole countryto benefit at the same time and I have carefully considered this point. Such astep would ensure that London and the South-Eastern counties, which have been most heavily attacked by flying bombs recently and by piloted attacks earlier inthe year, would benefit as well as other parts of the country, and in some waysthis would be desirable. On the other hand. London and South-Eastern Englandhave always been the main target of enemy attack and, according to the Chiefsof Staffs recent appreciation, are likely to remain the main if not the sole objectof any attack which may be made by piloted aircraft. Such attacks are consideredmore likely and more effective if the black-out were lifted in that area.7. I therefore suggest for consideration two alternative schemes for relaxing the black-out: (a) The relaxations recommended in the Report of the Commit tee on Black-out Restrictions should be introduced, but the area should be extended[28134]SECRET.W.P. (44) 490.2nd September, 1944.
to cover the whole of England, Scotland and Wales, except that partSouth and East of the line  lumber to Southampton Water (see mapattached); or(b) Relaxations as above should be introduced in the same area as above,but in addition that part of the country South and East of the lumber-Southampton Water line should also be allowed to relaxdomestic lighting to a dim-out, and to introduce improved industrial and vehicle lighting, but not street lighting.8. The suggestion in 7 (a) above would allow all the relaxations suggestedby the Committee on Black-out restrictions in the area which the Chiefs of Staffnow consider unlikely to be raided by piloted aircraft and would mean extending the area which the Committee originally proposed by adding South Wales, South-West England, North-East England north of the  lumber, and Eastern Scotland.The result would be, however, that in Lonclan and South-Eastern England therewould be no relaxation, although the matter could again be considered from timeto time in the light of the war situation then existing.9. The suggestion in 7 (b) would allow all the relaxations suggested by theCommittee to be applied over the whole of England, Scotland and Wales, exceptthat in London and South-Eastern England (i.e., South and East of the line lumber to Southampton Water), improved street lighting would not be permittedat this stage. I suggest that improved street lighting in this area should be excluded because very little of it is capable of central control, and would therefore have to remain alight during an alert, a fact which might cause considerableapprehension to people, especially in large built-up areas like London, and aid theenemy&apos;s inferior pilots if the enemy attacked. In addition, there are so manyseparate lighting authorities in and around London (25 in the L.C.C. area alone)that relaxation of street lighting could only result in very patchy lighting, depend-ing on the state of street lighting equipment and whether the individual lightingauthorities decided to take advantage of the relaxation or not. It might, ofcourse, be possible to compel authorities to act uniformly, but such action wouldnot be without its difficulties.   Later on many of these difficulties should pass.10. The relaxation to a i; dim-out &quot; of domestic, office and other lightingwould be achieved by using existing or other opaque curtains, which would haveto be of sufficient thickness to screen windows so that excessive light was notvisible from them. This would allow the use of ordinary peace-time curtains orblinds, except the most flimsy ones, so that in the streets the black-out would bereplaced by a &quot; dim-out.&quot; As even this in thickly populated areas would mean a considerable total of light, complete obscuration would be required on an alert,either by drawing the black-out curtains or by extinguishing the lights. It is recognised, however, that this provision will be ineffective in areas where there areno sirens, and e\en in areas served by sirens there Avill be frequent cases of failure to obscure on a warning.11. It is realised that the extension of all relaxations, except improved street lighting, to London and South-Eastern England would relieve the general publicof what has been considered by many to be a depressing requirement and wouldalso obviate the renewal of warnout black-out material in many cases. On theother hand, many people in London and South-Eastern England would beapprehensive of a relaxation they would regard as premature, and if Londonwere bombed they might attribute any destruction caused to the raising of the black-out and unite in condemning the Government^ precipitate action &quot;inthe last few weeks of war.&quot; And many of those who had advocated relaxationmight well join in&apos; the condemnation.12. Nevertheless, the Allies are now moving so fast towards Germany that,provided there is general agreement in the War Cabinet, I consider what riskthere is might be taken and that the relaxations suggested in the report of theCommittee on Black-out Restrictions could be applied over the whole countryexcept that increased street lighting should not be allowed south and east ofthe line  lumber-Southampton Water. This area would be subject to such adjustments on the coast as the Admiralty consider necessary to avoid assistingenemy submarines or surface craft.H.
