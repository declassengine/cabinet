THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of ..............................................................TOP SECRET Copy No.R.A. (44) 24.5th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.Rocket Consequences Committee.Report.WE* were appointed by the War Cabinet at their Meeting on the 28th July,1944, t to concert action and plans to meet the contingency of rocket attack onthe scale which then seemed possible. Matters in regard to which action was tobe taken forthwith and the lines on which plans were to be prepared, togetherwith the Ministerial responsibility in respect thereof, were set out in an annex to the War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions.t which is reproduced as Appendix I to thisreport. We were granted discretion to settle matters brought before us, reportingto the War Cabinet as and when necessary.2. Since the date of our appointment the position has undergone a funda-mental change, as a result partly of the latest intelligence about the rocket andpartly of the progress of the Allied Armies, and at their meeting on the 31stAugust, 1944.J tne War Cabinet authorised us to base our plans on an up-to-dateappreciation by the Chiefs of Staff of the possible scale and duration of attack.3. The possible average weight of combined rocket and flying bomb attacksuggested in this appreciation as a basis for planning is up to 80 tons of H.E.a day falling in London Region, which should be compared with the averageof 48 tons a clay experienced during the worst week of flying bomb attacks.Rocket attack may start at any time from now onwards, but the enemy is unlikely to be able to launch rockets or flying bombs against London on any appreciablescale after the Allied armies have crossed the Franco-Belgian frontier.4. It is clear that, if the appreciation summarised above had been available at the date of our appointment, the action ordered and the planning authorised by the War Cabinet would have been on a reduced scale. It has seemed to us,however, that in view of the possibility that London may yet have to undergo a short period of heavier attack from flying bombs and rockets combined, acomplete reversal of the action and planning initiated would be a mistake atthe present juncture. We have therefore directed that, whilst action which is of value from the point of view of flying bomb attack alone (apart from its valuefrom the point of view of possible rocket attack) should proceed, plans on a moreambitious scale to meet the contingency of severe rocket attack should, so far aspossible, be kept on a paper basis. We propose that the matter should be reviewed again in, say, a fortnight&apos;s time.5. We think it right to record that in reviewing our plans in the light ofthe new appreciation we have assumed that, in spite of the increasinglyfavourable outlook, there will be no relaxation of offensive action with the object* The Rocket Consequences Committee comprises:  The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (in the Chair),The Minister of Labour and National Service,The Minister of Production,The Minister of Health,The Minister of War Transport,with power to consult other Ministers as necessary.I W.M.

of preventing the initiation by the enemy of rocket attack during the probablyshort time left to him in which to do so, or. if rocket attack is initiated, of reducing the scale of such attack to a minimum.6. The action recorded and the plans summarised in the report are based onthe assumption that it would be the Governments intention to maintain, for aslong as conditions under rocket attack made it feasible, a policy of &quot; stand fast.&quot;by which we understand the maintenance of the seat of Government and thecontinuance of war production and other essential activities in London.7. We proceed to deal with the action taken and plans made under a numberof separate heads : I.-Evacuation ((2)  (a) and (b) ; (3)  (a) and (b)).*(a) A ction taken in advance of rocket attack.8. The evacuation areas have been extended to include 27 Boroughs and urban Districts around the Metropolitan area, and evacuation facilities have beenmade available to all mothers with children of school age or under. Theevacuation of organised parties of unaccompanied children and mothers with children has continued, and there has also been a considerable evacuation ofmembers of the priority classes under private arrangements.9. The total number of persons (excluding holiday makers) who have leftLondon is estimated to have been 1.450.000 on the &quot;31st August, including280,000 evacuated in organised parties under the Government Evacuation Scheme.The population of London has thereby been reduced to 5.450.000. We deal below(paragraph 21) with measures to maintain the tempo of evacuation, so far as thisis now possible, and to discourage a drift back.(b) Plans to be operated in the event of rocket attack.10. The arrangements for the evacuation of organised parties of the priority classes and the issue of travel vouchers and billeting certificates to members of the priority classes who could make private arrangements would continue as long as practicable. In addition, the following plans are being madeto meet the possibility of a spontaneous move to leave London on a large scale : (i) Evacuation by rail.11. In order both to assist in maintaining the observance of the &quot; standfast &quot; policy and to secure a measure of order at the stations and in the reception areas, a &apos;&apos; Voucher Scheme&quot; (the details of which -ire set out in Appendix II)would be operated, should the circumstances at the time appear to the WarCabinet to warrant it. Although it would be possible, without such a scheme, toregulate, by means of train arrangements only, the flow of refugees into the reception areas, it might prove impossible to prevent chaos arising at the Londonstations or to maintain the running of ordinary trains. It is estimated that thenumber of persons who could be moved each day by long-clistance trains, includingmovement under the Government Evacuation Scheme and a &quot; Voucher Scheme,&quot;-would be 150.000. The question of the necessary publicity for a &quot; VoucherScheme &quot; of evacuation is dealt with below (paragraph 22).(ii) Evacuation via &quot;fringe&quot; areas.12. Temporary accommodation in Best and Reception Centres in the&quot; fringe &quot; areas&quot; (i.e., areas outside the London Region and within a radius of40 miles from the Centre of London) is sufficient only for 700,000 persons (or, if theSouth-Eastern Region is excluded, for 500,000 persons), and we are satisfied that itcannot be materially augmented. This accommodation would be used for dealingwith any spontaneous movement that might take place towards the &quot; fringe&quot;areas, whether on foot or otherwise, and for this reason there would be no organisedevacuation into these areas. Rest and Reception Centres in the &quot; fringe&apos;&quot; areas are being got ready to operate and plans are being made to ensure that refugeeson their way to these areas are directed to the Centres, with the aid, if necessary,of special transport. Bus and rail transport would be provided to move refugeeson to more distant reception areas if the &quot; fringe &quot; areas became overcrowded.* References are bo Appendix I.
13. Billeting of persons on private householders or accdmmodating themin premises on a family or communal basis involves the provision of beds, blanketsand other necessary equipment. The stocks of such goods which the Ministryof Health can ordinarily draw upon are insufficient to provide for any further large-scale evacuation from London and the possibility of drawing upon other resources is being examined interdepartmentally.14. Co-ordination of the planning of the evacuation of the civilian population, of industrial workers (see III below) and of Government staffs (seeIV below), in accordance with the War Cabinefs directions,^ is being effected by an informal working party comprising representatives from the official committee on the Evacuation of Government Departments, the Health Depart-ments and the Ministry of Production.II.-Hospitals ( (2) (c) ).Action in advance of rochet attack.15. On the 30th August, the numbers of patients and staff evacuated from vulnerable areas amounted to 14.126 and 1.608 respectively. Of these,5,291 patients and 580 staff have been accommodated in Scottish hospitals. Themovement is being carried out without interfering with the reception andevacuation of battle casualties arriving from France or from more distanttheatres. The number of vacant beds in vulnerable areas in the London areaavailable for casualties amounted on the 30th August to 28.249 and, in addition,8,179 beds could be made available at a few hours&apos; notice by discharging patientsto their homes.Ill-Production ( (2) (d) ).Action in advance of rocket attack.16. The orderly dispersal from London of a limited amount of production which is (a) of a unique, or nearly unique, character; or(6) of special importance, either by reason of operational needs or because a large proportion of an important production is in the London area,is proceeding subject to the limitations that no move is being carried out which (c) could not be substantially completed by the 15th October;(d) would involve a loss in the production concerned of more than the equivalent of two months&apos; output.In view of the revised appreciation of the probable scale of attack, a high degree of flexibility in the arrangements is being preserved. The movement is mainly one of personnel rather than plant and, in order to avoid prejudicing the&quot; stand fast&quot; policy, it is being justified by the need to remove the productionof certain essential supplies to less vulnerable areas and not on the security ofthe workers. &quot; Adoption billeting,&quot; whereby the receiving factory arranges forthe accommodation of incoming workers, is being used to the greatest possible extent. Arrangements have also been worked out by the departments concerned for dealing with the personal and financial problems of the transferred workers and their dependants. ...IV.-Government Staffs ( (2) (e) ; (3) (e)).(a) Action in advance of rocket attack.17. The transfer of the 10.000 headquarters staffs, formerly housed in pooraccommodation with no form of shelter, is well advanced.(b) Plans to be operated in the event of rocket attack.18. Enquiries have shown that, of the present total headquarters staffsin London (130,000)-(a) 13,000 would be required to remain in London;(b) 85,000 might be evacuated to the provinces;(c) the remainder might be dismissed or &quot; stood off.&quot;* (8) ((/) of Appendix I.[28135] b 2
19. Citadel, deep shelter or other protected accommodation below groundcould be provided for the 13,000 at (a), and the necessary detailed plans arebeing worked out. Office accommodation in the provinces for the 85,000 at (b)could also be provided, and the necessary plans are being worked out under the aegis of the Official Committee on the Evacuation of Government Departments.The provision of living accommodation for this staff would present greater difficulties. No actual move of staff covered by (b) would be made unless a ministerial direction to that effect had been given, and the plans are being so framed as to permit of their being operated gradually. With regard to the staffsat (c) it is felt that, in view of the shortage of man-power, it would not be rightto contemplate the &quot; standing off&apos;&apos; of any staff for an indefinite period.20. It is the intention that, so far as possible, the dependants of CivilServants should be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded todependants under the scheme for the movement of key industrial workers (seeIII above). Steps would also be taken to evacuate the families of Governmentstaff who had to remain in London in the event of the evacuation of the staff at (b) being carried out.Y.-Publicity ( (2) (f) and (g) ).(a) Action in advance of rocket attack.21. The aim should be to secure the maintenance of the evacuation of the priority classes and of others with no war duties in London. The PrimeMinisters statement in the House of Commons on the 2nd August* created apropitious atmosphere, and discreet use of the Prime Ministers exhortation hasbeen made by the Minister of Health in the course of publicising the arrangementsfor the evacuation of the priority classes. A further display of posters has beenarranged and Press advertisements are being prepared. There is a serious risk,however, lest as a result of the end of the holiday season, the slackening of flying-bomb attack and the rapid growth of optimism about the end of the war, movementout of London on any appreciable scale may cease and be replaced by a driftback. The Ministers concerned are considering if any further steps can be takenby general publicity to counter such a development.(b) Plans to be operated in the event of rocket attack.22. The War Cabinet have already approvedt a scheme under which, assoon as rocket attack was confirmed, drastic restrictions would be imposed for aperiod of at least 48 hours with the object of denying all information to theenemy about the effect of the attack. The Departments concerned are considering,with due regard to security requirements, what would be the most appropriateform of publicity for the &quot; Voucher Scheme &quot; if it were decided to operate it.YI.-Double Summer Time ((2) (h) ).23. The Lord Presidents Committee decideclj that double summer time should be extended to the 17th September, and a public announcement to this effect was made on the 3rd August.YII.-Demolition, Clearance and Repairs ((3) (c) ).24. On the basis of present figures and plans the labour forces likely to beavailable in the event of rocket attack for demolition, clearance and repairswould be as follows :- (i) House repairs.Civilian- 60,000-70,000.Services (excluding A rmy) 4,000.$(ii) Repairs to buildings other than houses.Civilian 15,000.* Official Report, Column 1478.t W.M.  (44) 98th  Conclusions, Minute 2.t L.P. (44) 39th Meeting.5 This labour might alternatively be employed, either in whole or in part, on demolition,clearance and repairs to essential services (see (iii)), and might possibly be augmented.
(iii) Demolition, clearance and repairs to essential services.Civilian London War Debris Survey (10,000).Civil Engineering labour (under paragraph 25 below) (10,000).Services Special Force, London (Army) (7,000 net).*In the event of heavy and continued rocket attack, demolition, clearance and repairs to essential services would constitute the major problem. The forces thatwould be available for these purposes (see (iii) above) would, as at present, besubject to the general co-ordination of the Senior Regional Commissioner for london, who would be responsible for deciding priorities where necessary.Special Force, London, would be under the orders of G.O.C., London District,to whose staff the War Office have appointed an engineer officer of suitablestanding and experience (with a skeleton staff) who is familiarising himself withthe problems with which he would be faced in the event of rocket attack and establishing relations with those with whom he would be associated. In theevent, recourse might well be necessary to the precedent of 1940-41 when a SpecialCommissioner was appointed with the dutj&apos; of &quot; co-ordinating and facilitating the work of the authorities responsible for the restoration of roads and publicutility services damaged by enemy action, and with the duty of organising the clearance and salvage of debris.&quot;25. Arrangements have been made whereby, if and when the need arises,civil engineering contractors and their labour and plant may, under the directions of the Minister of Production, the Minister of Labour and the Ministerof Works, be transferred from any contract (except those on limited lists to beprepared by the Ministry of Production for the purpose), without the necessityof discussion with the individual Department concerned. The necessary arrangements for the transport and accommodation of the labour referred to under (i) to (iii) above are being examined.VIII. Feeding in London.26. The key to the problem of feeding those remaining in London under conditions of rocket attack lies in the retention of the labour required both to distribute food-stuffs and to operate commercial catering establishments, BritishRestaurants and other communal feeding places; stocks of food-stuffs are adequate.27. The Minister of Labour and National Service is taking all possible steps to provide and maintain adequate staffs for feeding establishments and,as an emergency measure, is prepared to direct women into catering work on thebasis of the conditions recommended by the Hetherington Committee for domesticworkers in institutions. The Minister is also making arrangements, in conjunc-tion with the Supply Ministers, whereby factory canteens would, in an emergency,provide meals for the families of their employees and others living in theneighbourhood.IX. Warning System.28. We have been informed of the arrangements already in being and in course of preparation for giving the warning of rocket attack, and have reachedthe conclusion that, in view of the many uncertainties in the situation, no public statement should be made at present, but that the question of making one shouldbe reconsidered as a matter of urgency if and when there is clear evidence ofthe imminence of attack. We also reached the conclusion that, although thePortsmouth-Southampton area is clearly within range of the rocket weapon, the warning should not be given there unless and until there is some evidence thatthe enemy is seeking to attack it.H. M.(On behalf of the Committee.)Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 15th  September, 1944.* It cannot be assumed that this Force would be wholly available for demolition, clearance and repairs to essential services, since in certain circumstances it might have to undertake rescue work.
Annex to Minutes of a Meeting of the War Cabinet held on Friday,28th July, 1944.(W.M. (44) 98th Conclusions.)Ministers responsible for action and Planning.Minister of Health.Minister of Food.Minister of War Transport.Minister of War Transport.Minister of Information.Minister of Health.Minister of Production.Minister of Labour.Supply Ministers.onanceiior oi me r^xcnequeiMinister of Works.jfrime Minister.Minister of Information.Home Secretary.(1) Plans should be made to meet the contin-gency of rocket attacks on the scale which now seemed possible, and certain action should betaken at once.(2) The following were the matters in regardto which action should be taken forthwith : (a) The evacuation of the priority classesshould be stimulated, and these classesshould be extended to include mothers withschoolchildren.(b) An estimate should be made of the extentto which the population of London hadbeen reduced since the flying bomb attacks had started. Enquiry should be made asto the considerable movement of populationinto London which was reported byrailways to be taking place, and as to thereasons for this movement, with a view toa decision on &quot;whether any steps should betaken to check it.(c) Steps should be taken, without publicity, tomove patients from the London hospitalsto hospitals in other parts of the country.This might involve drawing on the hospital accommodation set aside for Servicecasualties.(d) The process of shifting production fromfactories in London to factories elsewhereshould continue, particular attention being-paid to key factories.(e) The 10,000 Government staffs at presenthoused in poor accommodation with noform of shelter should be moved to other accommodation either in London or else-where.(/) In his forthcoming statement on the war situation the Prime Minister would giveparticulars of the casualties caused by flying bombs, and would emphasise that members of the priority classes would dowell to take advantage of the facilities for evacuation. He undertook to considerpassages submitted to him by the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home security and the Minister of Health.(9)(h)In addition, editors might be remindedconfidentially about the danger of rocketattack in such a way as to keep the publicaware of its possible imminence while taking special care not to cause alarm.The Lord Presidents&apos; Committee would consider whether, from the point of view cfdefence against flying bomb and rpck . attacks, it would be advisable to continuedouble summer time for a further period after the 13th August.
(3) Plans should be prepared to meet the con-contingency of rocket attack on the following lines : (a) Transport and accommodation should beavailable in order to enable up to 2 millionadditional persons to be evacuated from london to safe areas within a period ofthree to four weeks. Alternative plans should also be made for moving the same number in a shorter period to a distance ofsome 20 miles from London.(b) The emergency arrangements for dealingwith a large exodus on foot from london should be brought into a state of readiness.(c) Arrangements should be made to enable thesupply of building labour available for the clearance of debris and the repair ofdamaged houses in London to be reinforcedfrom both civilian and Service sources.(d) The co-ordination of the shifting of pro-duction from factories in London to factories elsewhere with the transfer of theCivil population under the evacuationarrangements should be studied.(e) Arrangements, to be operated in the eventof rocket attack, should be made for theevacuation from London of non-essentialGovernment staffs and for the allocation ofthe most highly protected accomodation to those staffs who must remain in London.APPENDIX II.Voucher Scheme.1. Subject to the effects of damage to the railways, three classes of trainswould operate from London : (i) Ordinary trains, on which normal fares would be paid for ticketspurchased at booking offices, would be available for persons travellingon business, members of the Forces and those who decide to move outindependently.(ii) Special evacuation trains for the priority classes, as at present,(iii) Extra trains to selected destinations to carry persons holding vouchersissued by the local authorities. On these trains the passengers wouldhave no choice of destination. These trains would run only to thedestinations agreed between the Ministry of Health and the Ministryof War Transport, the numbers a day to each destination also being agreed.2. The vouchers, printed on different-coloured paper according&apos; to the station at which the holder must entrain, would give no. indication of destination but would show day of departure and the approximate hour at which the holder should present himself at the station. (This is important to avoid large crowds ofvoucher holders thronging the stations all day.)3. The distribution of vouchers would be decentralised to a number of distributing Centres to be organised by the local authorities of the metropolitan area, who have already indicated their willingness to undertake the task. Anofficer of the Ministry of Labour and National Service would be present at eachCentre to advise on the grant of vouchers from the point of view of themaintenance of essential war work in London. The arrangements would ensureflexibility in bulk allocation of vouchers to Distributing Centres.4.   A flat rate of 5s. would be charged for the vouchers with no remissionsMinisters responsible forA ction and Planning.Minister of War Transport.Minister of Health.Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security.Minister of Food.Minister of Health. &apos;Home Secretary.Minister of Food.Minister of Labour.Minister of Health.Minister of Works.Minister of Food.Minister of Production.Minister of Labour.Minister of Health.Chancellor of the Exchequer.Minister of Works.
