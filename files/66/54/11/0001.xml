It is issued for the personal use of............/sL^C+aJ^TOP SECRET Copy No.offW.P. (44) 461.22nd August, 1944.WAR CABINET. ]AXSITUATION&quot; IN WARSAW.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.vI circulate to my colleagues herewith (1) a translation of the latest messagereceived by the Polish Government from the General Officer Commanding,Warsaw, about the situation there, together with (2) the text of the six latestmessages, dated the 18th, 19th and 20th August, from an escaped British R.A.F.prisoner of war, Sergeant Ward, who is with the Polish Underground Army in warsaw, and has been sending frequent messages about the position there.A. E.Foreign Office, 22nd August, 1944.(1)Telegram from Warsaw.The lack of effective help, with the exception of a few droppings, is the main reason why Warsaw has become a beleaguered city and the Home Army is forcedto a defensive position. The liquidation of the numerous points which theGermans hold in the capital is impossible in view of the lack of offensive weapons and ammunition. The Germans are up to now sticking to the defensive and theydo not dare up to now to pass over to the offensive. We do well understand thattime is working against us, and that the prolongation of the present phase of ourfight brings with it bad results for the city in its beleaguered condition. above all there is a deterioration in the food supply, sanitary arrangements, and alsomorale of the population in view of the fact that whole quarters are burnt downand that the population is exposed to the terrors of bombardment and to beingmarched off by the Germans. The Soviet Army is again, in the last few days,standing again inactive at the gates of Warsaw. There has only appeared anannouncement by General Rola of a march for the liberation of Warsaw and the punishment of those guilty of spilling the blood of the people of Warsaw through a premature rising. In spite of this, early action on the part of the Soviet Armyseems doubtful. The breaking of the deadlock and the overcoming of existingdifficulties is not possible without serious droppings of arms and ammunition.The prolongation of the present phase leads to the total obliteration of Warsaw.In the course of the nineteen days 70 per cent, of the buildings of the city havebeen burnt and destroyed.(2)(No. 625.) ISth August. 1944.From J. Ward, No. 542939.The main situation in Warsaw has not changed. In the centre of the cityfighting continues to be very heavy. The enemy continues with the ruthlessdestruction of the city by air bombardment, with tank 75 mm. artillery, and withhalf explosive and half incendiary mines propelled by mine throwers.

(No. 626.) - l$tk August, 1944.From J. Ward.The. people of Warsaw call the Germans&apos; minethrower the moving cupboardon account of the fact that it gives out a sound like that of a heavy piece of furniturebeing moved, followed a few seconds later by a number of terrific explosions.The Prudential Building on Sq. Napoleon, the highest building in Warsaw,was hit three times by mines and once by bombs. It is completely burnt out. Thepavements in Warsaw have been turned into grave-yards. In many places one cannot walk on the pavement without treading on fresh graves.(No. 627.) mh August, 1944.Addressed to especially.   From J. Ward.Sir, reply to my telegram received.I was born Birmingham. Maiden name of mother Anne ElizabethMargewws [sic&apos;], father&apos;s John Ward. Address, 54 Madison Avenue, Wardend,Birmingham, 8.Sir, I beg for more detailed orders. For three years I have worked in Polishunderground army. Now, acting on advice of the Polish staff here, am combiningmy military duties as acting It. in A.K. with that of War Correspondent. all my telegrams are without censure.(No. 634.) &apos; 20th August, 1944.From J. Ward, No. 542939 R.A.F.Thousands of people are each day rendered homeless in Warsaw andhundreds killed. The German forces make no difference between civil population and troops of A.K. The ruthless destruction of property goes on unhinderedby any scruples. There are thousands of civilian wounded men, women andchildren suffering from the most horrible burns and in some cases from shrapneland bullet wounds. Each day battle of Warsaw is prolonged the cost mountinghigher. But the determination of the population to figlit to the last man is onlystrengthened by this German barbarism.(No. 635.) 20f/i August, 1944.From J. Ward, No. 542939, R.A.F.On practically every open piece of ground in Warsaw are being dug wells.The shortage of water is &quot;starting to be serious. If in ten days the city receivesno relief then the (?)food will also give out. Rations are already very short.It is no exaggeration to say that the situation of Warsaw is desperate. On the outskirts of the city are huge concentration camps full of women and childrenliving in the open air without food or help of any kind. They are dying of hungerand disease under the most terrible conditions. The Germans show no mercy tothese helpless people. They have no men to look after them. The men were shotwhen the women and children were taken prisoners.(No. 636.) 20^ Atigiist, 1944.From J. Ward, No. 542939, R.A.F.The Germans have in many areas got over from the defensive to the attack.The high school on Noakowski street was taken by Germans at 5 hours on the19th August. The attack was carried out under a heavy artillery barrage &amp;ndsupported by tanks. The lack of ammunition and weapons is being heavily felt by the Polish forces. Despite these drawbacks, however, the troops of A.K.continue to fight with magnificent courage. Other attacks from the german forces on the night of the 19th August south of Av. Sikorski were firmly held.40 per cent, of the city centre is already completely destroyed and another 20 percent, badly damaged. Reports from the suburbs also tell of the terrific destruc-tion. The Germans are carrying out their attempt to destroy Warsaw. Lossof life among civil population and in A.K. is very high.
