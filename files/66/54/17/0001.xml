THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944:The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.   It is issued for the personal use of .v^^^rr^y^..TOP SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 467. /25 A August, 1944. /WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER FOR THE SUPPLY DEPARTMENTS IN 1944.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.1. The total reductions which the various Departments were provisionallyasked to make for the whole year 1944 are as follows : Admiralty..................       - 50,000Ministry of Supply ......      .....,       -170,000Ministry of Aircraft Production..........       -198,000*2. In W.M. (44) 106th Conclusions, Minute 2, I was asked to submitestimates of man-power requirements for the munition industries on the revisedassumption made by the War Cabinet that the war in Europe will end before june 1945.3. (a) A dmiralty. Since practically the whole of the Admiralty industriallabour as at present planned depends upon the scale of operations envisaged inthe Japanese war, the assumption has no effect upon Admiralty requirements.The Admiralty consider that they can adjust their programme to conform to theprovisional allocation proposed. I am not yet in a position to review the effect upon the Admiralty labour requirements of the Prime Minister&apos;s directive thatthe strength of the Navy in Stage 2 should be cut by 200,000.(b) Ministry of Supply. The fact that casualties in the Army have been less than was anticipated means that more formations will be fighting-later in this year and early next year than was originally supposed,and consequently no reductions in requirements for the remainder of this,year are likely to be made. The Ministry of Supply are now engagedin reviewing their programmes in detail but do not think that they can make programme cuts which would conform to the new man-power allocation.They consider, therefore, that if their labour force is reduced as proposed therewill in consequence be a short fall of some 10 per cent, on their deliveries this yearto the Services. This will not be spread equally between all deliveries. More-over, production programmes do not in all cases match requirements, and this applies particularly to the War Office. The Ministry of Supply consider,therefore, that they have a strong claim for some increase in the proposed allocation if this should prove possible. In their view some small relief may result from the assumption that the war will have ended by June 1945, but thiswould be entirely absorbed in reducing the extent of their shortfall onprogrammes.(c) Ministry of Aircraft Production. It has been agreed that the M.A.P.labour force needed at the 31st December, 1944. to provide for the R.A.F. ceiling of 522 squadrons is 1,623,000. It was further agreed (W.M. (44) 106th Con-elusions) that this decision would not be affected by the revised assumptionregarding the end of the war.4. Lest these conclusions should appear to show disappointing results fromthe new assumption on which we are working, I must point out that in the first* Raised from 180,000 under W.M. (44) 100th Conclusions, Minute   i.[28085]
half of next year when we shall be in an even tighter position for man-power,the effect of the assumption will be to release quite considerable numbers ofworkers, especially in primary production and the production of components. Atthis time the cutting clown of programmes in their later stages should have the dual effect both of stepping up the production of complete equipments and alsopermitting some substantial increase in the allocations for non-munitions work.5. The saving on the provisional allocation to M.A.P. provides a margin of 18,000 assuming that the total reduction during 1944 of the man-power in the munitions industries (including work for other Government Departments) isstill to remain at 410,000. The events of the last year have shown that a largenumber of unpredictable demands of an urgent operational nature come forward in the course of any campaign. I am convinced that we should be well advised to retain this 18,000 as a reserve against such emergencies. I propose that itshould be held at the disposition of the Minister of Labour and myself for allocation to meet such special needs.6. With this change, therefore, I recommend that we confirm the provisionalallocations made in July for the remaining months of 1944.7. The final revisions of the mid-year strengths of the three supply departments are now available. I suggest that we should take this opportunityto adjust the current allocations for the second half-year to accord with them.If my proposals in paragraphs 4 and 5 are accepted the allocations would be asfollows : Ministryof Supply.     Admiralty.      M.A.P. Total.Strength at 1st January,1944   .......&apos;..     1,469,300        918,000       -1,821,300       4,208,600Revised Allocations foryear 1944    ......    - 170,000      - 50,000      - 198,000      - 400,000*Target     Strength     at end-1944&quot;     ......     1,299,300        868,000        1,623,300       3,808,600Actual     Strength     at30th June. 1944     ...     1,392,200 896,500        1,741,300        4,030,000Balance for second half1944   .........     - 92,900       - 28,500       - 118,000       - 221,400*O. L.Ministry of Production,Great George Street, S.W. 1,25th August, 1944.* There are, in addition, 10,000 in the Munitions Industries to be released from the work ofother Government Departments during the year. Allowance is made in each case in the total for the full allocation of the reserve of 18,000 proposed in paragraph 4.
