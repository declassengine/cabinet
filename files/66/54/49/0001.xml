(44) 499.4th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.ARMISTICE TERMS EOR HUNGARY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN view of developments in South-Eastern Europe, Hungary&apos;s exit from thewar is unlikely to be long delayed.I suggested to the United States and Soviet Governments earlier this monththat the question of armistice terms for Hungary should be discussed at theEuropean Advisory Commission. The United States Government have agreed.The Soviet Government have not yet replied. I have pressed for an answer,but if the Soviet Government make any difficulties about discussion at theEuropean Advisory Commission, I am ready to propose, and try to agree, terms for Hungary through diplomatic channels.I submit in an annex the terms I would like to propose. The Soviet Govern-ment may be disposed to impose harsher terms on Hungary than on Roumania.From our point of view I see advantage in treating Hungary and Bulgaria on similar lines. The draft terms for Hungary are thus modelled on the draftBulgarian Armistice which emerged from recent discussions at the european advisory Commission and which takes into account the views expressed thereby the Soviet representative and the terms which the Soviet Government intend to impose on Roumania.Two special issues arise in the case of Hungary. The first is the questionof Transylvania. The whole of Transylvania was handed over to Roumaniaafter the last war under the Trianon Settlement. Roumania also received a large area in the Hungarian plain to the west of Transylvania proper, but this is covered by the phrase Transylvania for the purposes of this paper. There are estimated to be over 1,500,000 Magyars in Transylvania, as compared with over .000,000 Roumanians. Unfortunately the two populations are inextricablyintermingled. In particular, one large and compact Magyar community theSzekels is in the extreme eastern part of Transylvania next to Roumania.Under the second Vienna Award of 1940 the Germans and Italians dividedTransylvania in two by a line running from west to east, leaving the southern and larger part in Roumania, and the northern part, with about 1,000,000Magyars going to Hungary. His Majesty&apos;s Government never recognised this second Vienna Award, carried out under the auspices of Germany and Italy,both of them enemy States. If the whole of Transylvania is to go either toHungary or Roumania, the Roumanians, being considerably more numerous, havethe better claim. Hence the clause in the proposed Roumanian Armistice Terms,to which we have agreed, that &quot; Transylvania or the greater part of that terri-tory &quot; should be restored to Roumania. This is in any case the firm intentionof the Soviet Government. But, having regard to the very large Hungarianminority, some modification of the Trianon Settlement may be desirable. no final solution of this problem can, however, be reached untii the eventual peace settlement. We have provided for this in the Roumanian Armistice Terms by[28153]
making the restoration to Roumania . of the whole or the greater part ofTransylvania &quot; subject to confirmation at the peace settlement.&quot; The only practical interim arrangement is to restore the Trianon frontier as it existed before the second Vienna Award imposed by Hitler in August 1940.Hungary also acquired territory under earlier awards of Hitler, i.e., Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia and a strip along the southern frontier of Slovakia from czechoslovakia, and districts to it south belonging to Yugoslavia.The general formula in Article III is designed to cancel all theseacquisitions.The second issue is the question of military occupation. The Bulgarianarmistice does not provide for military occupation. In the case of Hungarythere is no reason why we should object to it, but, as we ourselves never intendedto provide more than a token force for the purpose. I think we should leave it tothe Soviet Government to suggest this. Without knowing more of the Sovietattitude towards Hungary it is difficult to judge the right note to strike.If the terms for Hungary are approved, I propose :-(a) that they should be communicated to the E.A.C., if the Soviet Govern-ment agree to discussion in that body;(b) that they should be communicated to the United States and soviet governments by the Foreign Office, if the Soviet Government makes any difficulty about adopting the E.A.C. procedure.A.
