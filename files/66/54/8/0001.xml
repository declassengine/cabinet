Aircraft Carriers Disposition and Movements.1. Fleet Carriers.H.M.S. VictoriousH.M.S. Furious(i) During the period under review, three abortiveattempts were made to attack the German battleshipAdmiral von Tirpitz in her Northern berth, on each occasion our forces being obliged by unfavourable weather to retire without attacking.(ii) In addition to the operations mentioned above,a vigorous offensive has been maintained against enemy merchant shipping in Norwegian waters.In a series of five strikes, on the 6th, 8th, 14th and15th May and the 1st June, Naval aircraft operating from these two carriers or from the Escort CarriersH.M.S. Searcher, Striker and Emperor, sank or seriously damaged six merchant ships totalling some30,000 G.R. tons, one escort vessel and two armed trawlers and probably damaged seven ships ofapproximately 20,000 G.R. tons.On two occasions when aircraft failed to locate enemyconvoys, the fish-oil factory at Stadlandet and the oil tanks at Kjoholen were selected as alternative targets and were sucessfully attacked.Six aircraft (2 Barracudas, 2 Hellcats and 2 Wildcats)were lost by enemy action in these operations. Germanfighters put in one&apos;appearance only, when Llellcats, intheir first combat with Messerschmidts and Focke Wulfs,shot down three enemy aircraft without loss to them-selves. A total of eleven enemy aircraft were destroyed,one probably destroyed and two damaged during thisseries of operations.H.M.S. Formidable (iii) At 0230/17th July the German battleshipH.M.S. Admiral von Tirpitz was again attacked at her berth inIndefatigable   Kaafjord.   This time the enemy was on the alert and h.M.S. Furious had started putting up smoke well before our aircraftarrived. All aircraft of the first strike had to bombblind as the smoke screens formed an almost solid blanketup to 800 ft. and obscured both the ship and the shoresof the Fjord. Only 3 or 4 pilots caught a glimpse ofthe target and most bombs were therefore dropped wherethe flak was thickest. Hellcats attacked a variety of targets and left an enemy trawler burning.  One Corsair[28041] b
crashed on shore. As the second strike was about to be flown oft&apos;, the ships ran into a thick fog bank. further operations were abandoned.H.M.S. Furious In the last week of June, the 1st Cruiser Squadron,with only this one carrier in company, completed an operation designed to maintain the threat of invasionon the South Coast of Norway, but the enemy refusedto react to these activities.H.M.S. Illustrious      In company with the U.S. Saratoga, a combinedstriking- force of British and American aircraft attacked the Japanese-occupied port of Sourabaya on the17th May. Some 10 enemy ships (totalling approximately35,000 G.R.T.) and two floating docks were all heavilyhit by bombs while the important Braat NavalEngineering Works and the Wonokromo oil refinery were both completely destroyed. In addition. 2 enemy air-craft were shot down, 19 were destroyed on TanjongPriot airfield, and 15 more at Malang airfield, where ahangar was also set on fire and many other aircraft were damaged.Two of H.M.S. Illustrious&apos;^ Avengers crashed on take-oft&apos; but both crews were rescued. The combined strikeconsisted of 45 bombers and 40 fisrhters, only one ofwhich was lost by enemy action.On the 21st June, and after parting company with herAmerican consort, H.M.S. Illustrious flew off a strike of15 Barracudas, escorted by &quot;16 Corsairs, to attackmilitary objectives in the Andaman Islands. weather conditions were poor, with five to seven-tenths cloud at,500 ft. and heavy local rain, but the Mount AugustaRadar Station was completely destroyed while the MountHarriet Radar Station and its tower were damaged.Barracks and power-houses on Ross Island and atAberdeen Harbour, together with the Saw Mills onChatham Island, were all hit with bombs, fires were leftburning at the Seaplane base in Phoenix Bay and 2single-engined enemy aircraft were set ablaze on PortBlair airfield.One Barracuda failed to return, and anti-aircraft fire,described as heavy, damaged five other aircraft. Four ofthese safely landed on. The pilot of the fifth was forcedto abandon his Corsair over the Carrier but was rescuedunhurt.H.M.S. Illustrious On the 25th July the Japanese-held Naval base atH.M.S. Victorious    Sabang was heavily bombarded by major units of theEastern Fleet.Precise details of the part played by carrier-borne aircraft are not yet known but Corsairs strafed theenemy radar station, shot down 1 Sally and 1 Zeke andspotted for the battleships. Four other enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.One camera-equipped Corsair force-landed in the seabut the pilot was rescued and five other Corsairs,damaged by flak, all safely landed on.An attempt, some hours later, by enemy aircraft toattack our retiring forces was turned when still somedistance from the Fleet and after a difficult chase incloud 3 Zekes were shot down and 2 other aircraft were damaged.H.M.S. Victorious       Both sailed to join Eastern Fleet on the 12th June.H.M.S. IndomitableH.M.S. Formidable      Will probably sail to join Eastern Fleet at the end ofAugust.H.M.S. Implacable       Will join Home Fleet during October after the shiplias been worked up.
2. Escort Carriers.(i) In addition to the operations in Northern waters referred to inparagraph 1, item (ii), nine other Escort Carriers have covered and supportedtwenty-three convoys for either a part or the whole of their voyages during the3 months now reviewed. In all, these particular Escort Carriers have spent202 days at sea entirely on Trade Protection duties.(ii) Since June, each convoy on the United Kingdom-Gibraltar route hasbeen provided with an Escort Carrier for fighter protection against the increasedrisk of air attack in those waters.   H.M.S. Nairana has destroyed 2 Ju. 290s.(iii) Except in Northern waters, where as a result of 12 attacks,R.M.S. Fencer probably sank 3 U-Boats and HALS. Activity destroyed1 Blohm and Voss Ha. 138. the enemy&apos;s cautious tactics have denied these EscortCarriers the opportunities they have sought.(iv) Two other operations, both directly related to the landings in Normandy,were also undertaken.Immediately before and after D-Uay, H.M. Ships Pursuer, Tracker andEmperor, provided fighter cover for those Support Groups which were operating in the S.W. Approaches to intercept U-Boats on passage from the Lower FrenchAtlantic ports to the invasion area. Persistent low cloud hampered the fightersbut on the 9th June H.M.S. Purstter&apos;s aircraft destroyed 1 Ju. 88 just as it wasabout to attack a Sunderland on A/S patrol.On the 19th June H.M.S. Fencer and H.M.S. Striker stood North andby means of bogus W/T traffic hinted to the enemy that major operations aimed at his Northern Coasts were imminent. The limited endurance of their destroyerescort forced the carriers to retire before positive results could be achieved, butU-Boats did concentrate in Northern waters at a time when they were required bythe enemy elsewhere.(v) At various times, and in more normal routine anti-submarine activities,six escort carriers, H.M. Ships Vindex, Nairana, Biter, Striker, Emperor andTracker, have co-operated with several A/S Escort Groups spending in theaggregate 58 days at sea on such duty.Aircraft from these ships have had few opportunities to attack owing to thecautious behaviour of the German U-Boat command but on the 8th May aSwordfish operating from FI.M.S. Vindex attacked a U-Boat which had beenbrought to the surface by ships of the 5th Escort Group. Two accurately placeddepth-charges caused this U-Boat to break in two and sink immediately.(vi) Although several other contacts were secured and at least two sightingsmade at different times by aircraft operating from the other Escort Carriers,no evidence of damage was secured in any attack.(vii) H.M. Ships Hunter, Stalker and Attacker, all with a complement ofSeafires, arrived at Gibraltar on the 26th May and are now operating in mediterranean waters. Detailed information as to their activities has not yet reached the Admiralty but 30 per cent, of the aircraft carried have been lent tothe Tactical Air Force in Italy during June and July to gain operationalexperience.On the 15th July H.M. Ships Khedive, Pursuer. Searcher and Emperorsailed from United Kingdom to join these other vessels for future operations in the Mediten-anean.(viii) After refitting at Durban. H.M.S. Battler is again employed escortingtroop convoys, while H.M.S. Begtim and H.M.S. Shah are active on Anti-U-Boatoperations and general escort duties.Two other Carriers, H.M.S. Atheling and H.M.S. Ameer, are now also in eastern waters where it is expected H.M.S. Atheling will eventually act as thetraining carrier for squadrons working up in the Indian Ocean.(ix) Other Escort Carriers have been employed in transporting reserve and replacement aircraft from the United States to the British Isles, South africa and the Eastern Theatre.- (x) The two deck-landing training carriers, H.M.S. A rgus and FI.M.S.Ravager, were relieved for short periods by H.M.S. Trumpeter, H.M.S. Khediveand H.M.S. Rajah, and altogether during the period under review, these fivecarriers have qualified 275 pupils and given refresher courses to 20 others inaddition to training handling parties.(xi) H.M.S. Pretoria Castle continues in service as Trials Carrier.[28041] B 2
3. M.A.C. Ships.Nineteen of these vessels, two of which are under the Dutch Flag, are nowin service and in the aggregate have spent 817 clays at sea during the past three months.In the main these voyages have been uneventful but on the 25th May threeSwordfish armed with rocket projectiles and flown off from the M.A.C. shipsEmpire Mackendrick and Anyclus, attacked a U-Boat in the Western Ocean.This submarine fought back and escaped, slightly damaging all three aircraft.Section II.-Detached Naval Squadrons Operating from Shore Bases.4. (i) Since the first week in May, three squadrons of Swordfish and fivesquadrons of Avengers have operated under Coastal Command in general patrolduties by clay and night off the Dutch and Belgian coasts and in the english channel.Although some squadrons have not been so employed for the whole of theperiod under review, these aircraft have collectively contributed materially to thesuccess of recent cross-Channel operations. In addition to their intended, and successful, employment in harassing enemy surface and submarine forces, Sword-fish aircraft have laid smoke screens to protect convoys on passage up and downChannel, and have provided illumination for attacks by light coastal forces.Avengers on patrol have shot down two flying bombs.It is intended to start withdrawing these squadrons gradually as they arerequired for service afloat in Escort Carriers.(ii) A Naval Fighter Wing of forty sea fires was lent for operations ashore tospot for the fire of bombarding warships in Operation &quot; Overlord.&quot; This Wing,together with a Royal Air Force Spitfire Squadron and a United States NavalSquadron of aircrews landed from cruisers and battleships, and equippedtemporarily with Spitfires, operated from the Royal Naval Air Station, Lee-ou-Solent under command of the Tactical Air Force. This Inter-Service, Inter-Allied Organisation worked smoothly and well, and provided all the spottingaircraft required except that they were supplemented by some Royal Air ForceTactical Reconnaissance squadrons on D-Day.When not required for bombardment spotting the Wing carried out normaloffensive and fighter escort duties, during which seven enemy aircraft were destroyed or damaged.sea fires of this wing were responsible for destroying four German humantorpedoes. These were sighted during dawn patrols, early in July, as they werereturning to Le Havre from the anchorages off the beaches.Section III. Aircraft.5. British Aircraft.(i) The Seafire XV, with folding wings and a Griffon engine, is now startingproduction in place of the Seafire III. Squadrons will start re-equipping withthe new type at the end of this year.(ii) The Mosquito decklanding trials, referred to in the last report, havebeen most successfully completed. The aircraft was flown off at the normal allup weight of the Standard Fighter Bomber (about 22,000 lbs.) and was landed proportionate weights up to 20,000 lbs. which is the maximum weight for which the arrestergear of HATS. Imjylacable and Indefatigable is designed.(iii) Firefly squadrons are now operating from aircraft carriers as dayFighter-Reconnaissance aircraft and units of Night Fighter Fireflies should startforming before the end of 1944.6. American Aircraft.The Corsair and Hellcat continue to give excellent service. Both of thesetypes are now being received with fittings to enable them to carry bombs, andHellcats are being modified in the United Kingdom to carry Rocket Projectiles.Reports from the United States state that the Corsair is a good dive-bomber, and preliminary trials in this country confirm this statement. One squadron will be trained in dive-bombing for operational trials.The negotiations on assignments of United States aircraft to the Royal Navy,referred to in the last report, were completed in June. They produced a more satisfactory result than on the last occasion, and the assignment of United Statesfighters for the second half of 1944 is proving adequate to our needs.
