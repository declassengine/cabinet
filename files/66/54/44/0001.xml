THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 494.3rd September, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE OIL AGREEMENT.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a note by the Chairman ofthe Oil Control Board, dissenting from my paper W.P. (44) 454.The Minister of State generally approves my paper. The Minister resident in Washington for Supply and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury have also given it their approval.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S. W. 1,3rd September, 1944.Note -by the Chairman of the Oil Control Board.My view of the agreement differs considerably from that expressed in theLord Privy seal&apos;s report.I do not think the proposed Commission is well described as a Cartel. TheCommission will be entirely composed of Government representatives and is directed to work upon expansionist and non-restrictive principles. These arenot the features of a Cartel.Lord Beaverbrook stresses &quot; the dangers inherent in this international oilcartel &quot; and approaches the future in a resolutely defensive spirit.But I see some advantages. I agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequerwhen he said that &quot; the effect of the Memorandum was to give us a 50 per cent,share in the regulation of fcbc world&apos;s oil,-which was a marked improvement onthe&quot; present position, under which we were entirely at the mercy of the oil interests,and it placed us in a better position to consider the advantage of the consumer,who would be much worse off were there to be no inter-governmental arrangementat all.&quot;If, as a result of the chain of events feared by Lord Beaverbrook. surplusoil from the United States issued into the world market without the consent ofthe Commission, endorsed by both the British and American Governments, thenthat would be contrary to the agreement.  But I do not believe this will happen.Nor does the agreement, as I read it, give American production or any otherproduction the right to a pro rata place in world markets equivalent to pre-warexports. It lays down certain principles&apos; which oil experts believe will bringabout a considerable expansion of production in the Middle East, from whichwe may expect to benefit. World prices are bound to be influenced by increased production of the low-cost Middle Eastern oil.G. L.Westminster House, Millbank, S.W. 1,30th August, 1944.[28142]
