(44) IGOth Conclusions)the War Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that the assumption which should govern the currentaircraft programme should be that the Royal Air Force would notbe expanded beyond the size to be reached (under present plans) bythe end of 1944, that is to say, 522 squadrons.(2) Agreed that, the detailed implications in this decision should be worked out by the Minister of Labour and National Service, the Minister ofProduction, the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of aircraft Production, any unresolved difficulties being submitted tothe War Cabinet for final settlement.2. Discussions between our several Departments have now taken place, andthe following agreed conclusions are recorded for the information of the WarCabinet : (i) A net intake of 9,700 men and women will be required by the R.A.F.in the second half of 1944.(ii) The M.A.P. labour force will be reduced during 1944 by 198.000 to1,623,000. It is estimated that this will mean a reduction of 130.000in the strength of the labour force as at the 30th June, 1944.(iii) The aircraft programme is being adjusted to conform with this reducedlabour force.(iv) The M.A.P., in co-operation with the Ministry of Labour and NationalService, will achieve the required decrease by endeavouring to spread the cuts evenly over the rest of 1944 so far as this is practicable,(v) The Minister of Labour and National Service accepts the obligationto replace wastage where found to be necessary in factories unafftcted by the reductions in programmes, and any wastage which may occurat other factories in excess of the planned reduction in the labour force. &quot; He will, if necessary, take special steps to achieve this. TheM.A.P. on their part will assist the Ministry of Labour by arrangingprogramme cuts so far as possible in areas where labour is most needed,(vi) In the London area a different situation requiring separate considera-tion will arise if factories have to be evacuated and dispersed.E.
