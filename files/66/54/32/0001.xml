4 ?ffja&amp;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.THE WARTIME DEPARTMENTS.Report by the Chairman of the Machinery of Government Committee.Introduction.1. The following Departments depend for their existence on Orders inCouncil under the Ministers of the Crown (Emergency Appointments) Act, 1939,which is due to expire at the end of the &quot; emergency &quot; : Ministry of Production.Ministry of Aircraft Production.Ministry of War Transport.Ministry of Economic Warfare.Ministry of Food.Ministry of Home Security.Ministry of Information.Ministry of Fuel and Power.2.   In all these cases it will have to be decided : (a) whether the Ministry is to be continued after the expiry of emergency powers;(b) if not, which of its functions, if any, ought to be continued and to which department such functions should be assigned.3.   The future of the Ministries of Production and Aircraft Productiondepends on decisions taken on the general question of the organisation requiredafter the war for procuring Government supplies.   The Committee have thismatter under consideration but are not yet ready to report to the War Cabinet,se two Ministries are therefore not dealt with in this report.4. As regards the other six Departments mentioned in paragraph 1, theCommittee have given careful consideration to the problems raised in consultationwith all the Ministers concerned.* In all cases they had before them detailedanalyses prepared as a result of consideration and consultation at the official level, secret. fcrfpy No.  36W.P. (44) 482.31st August, 1944.WAR CABINET.Ministry of War Transport.5. This Ministry differs from the others in that it supersedes a peace-time Ministry and therefore exercises many functions derived from peacetimelegislation. At the end of the &apos;&apos; emergency &apos;&apos; the instruments setting up theMinistry of War Transport can be allowed to lapse and the Ministry of transport will thus again be brought into being.6. The Committee have already recommended to the War Cabinet(W.P. (44) 134) that the whole responsibility for civil aviation should ultimately be transferred from the Air Ministry to the Ministry of Transport, but that adecision in that sense should not be made public at this stage.7. As was mentioned in paragraph 2 of W.P. (44) 134, the Committee havealso formed the view that the functions in respect of docks, harbours and merchantshipping, which before the war fell to the Board of Trade and are now discharged by the Ministry of War Transport, ought after the war to be added to the* M.G. (44) 1st, 3rd, 9th, 10th, 12th and 15th Meetings,f M.G. (43) 11, M.G. (44) 2 and 8.[28117] B
responsibilities of the Ministry of Transport. There seems no reason why adecision to this effect should not be announced as soon as convenient.Ministry of Economic Warfare.8. After Germany is defeated and the blockade of Europe is lifted, the work required for economic&apos;warfare against Japan will not be enough in itself tojustify a separate Department, and on the conclusion of the war in Europe theMinistry of Economic Warfare should therefore be wound up. The prosecution of economic warfare against Japan should then be taken over by the ForeignOffice, but the terms of the announcement will have to be carefully considered in order to emphasise that economic warfare against Japan will be carried on with full vigour. The Committee do not think that such a step would be opento misinterpretation, for instance in the United States, China and the southern dominions, since it is well recognised that, whereas Britain is the senior partnerfor economic warfare against Germany, the United States is the senior partner for economic warfare against Japan, and that Washington is bound to be the centre of gravity for the United Nations&apos; war against Japan.9. The functions of the Ministry of Economic Warfare which can beregarded as permanent fall under two heads : (i) Planning for economic warfare, including the preparation of plans forreconstituting the machinery needed for carrying it out.(ii) Economic intelligence (including its financial aspect) and appreciationfor strategic and also, perhaps, for political purposes.10. Head (i) means the retention in peacetime of an embryonic Ministryof Economic Warfare, or of a plan for one; and this.should be the responsibilityof the Foreign Office.11. As regards head (ii), Ministry of Economic Warfare staff have hitherto been engaged on wrork which has arisen naturally from their other functions, but is really proper to the Foreign Office, in connection with the collection andappraisal of economic intelligence about foreign countries. This includes workfor the Service and other Departments which cannot conveniently be separated from work for the Foreign Office. The Committee agreed that the staff engaged on this work should be transferred to Foreign Office control, and in anticipation of War Cabinet approval certain administrative steps to this end have alreadybeen taken. The staffs present work includes much that is temporary (forinstance, the preparation of material on which policy decisions can be takenregarding armistice and peace treaty terms); but it is contemplated that as apermanent measure the Foreign Office should be more adequately equipped for thecollection and appraisal of economic intelligence about foreign countries, inorder to advise both the Foreign Secretary and other Departments interested.There are proposals to this effect in the White Paper on the reform of the foreign service,* and the transfer of Ministry of Economic Warfare staff represents a first step towards the desired end.12. The Committee also formed conclusions about the machinery forsecuring the central appraisal of economic information about all overseas countries (including the British Commonwealth and Empire), which will,however, be more conveniently dealt with in a later report.13. In the House of Lords on the 9th Mayt last the Minister of economic warfare adumbrated the possibility of arrangements on the lines suggested inparagraphs 8-11 above, without, however, indicating any firm government decision. There was no hostile criticism, and the Committee recommend that a firm announcement should be made as soon as convenient.Ministry of Food.14. The functions of the Ministry of Food fall under the following broadheadings : (a) The buying, selling, distribution and rationing of food, and control offood prices, which were not performed by the Government in peacetime.(6) Miscellaneous administrative functions in relation to food, a number ofwhich were to some extent performed by other Departments in peacetime.* Cmd. 6420.f Official Report, Cols. 046-8.
15. The functions5 at (b) above fall in their turn into two broad categories,namely, those concerned with the trade aspects.of food administration, for which,generally speaking, the Board of Trade were previously responsible; and those concerned with the health and nutrition aspects of food administration, for whichthe Health Departments were previously responsible. (For the general lines of nutrition policy the Health Departments, properly, still are.responsible, but theMinistry of Food&apos;s wartime duties and powers have enabled them to make a greatcontribution to the execution of nutrition policy, and as a matter of conveniencepolicy has been formulated by means of interdepartmental arrangements.)16. The Committee consider that so long as the functions at (a) persist,a separate Ministry of Food should be continued, and that it should also discharge the functions at (&amp;).. If and when, however, the functions at (a) are eitherabolished or reduced to a small compass, the functions remaining to the ministry will not prove commensurate with those of a first-class Department of State, andthe Ministry ought then to be abolished.17. It seems clear that reasons of scarcity, the continuance of the stabilisation-tion policy, the need to conserve foreign exchange and the pledges already given to British farmers will make it necessary that the functions at (a) shouldbe continued for at least the whole of tRe transitional period, and there is noreason why an announcement to this effect should not be made. The questionwhether these functions (and therefore a separate Ministry of Food) will be main-tained beyond that period depends in part on decisions on major questions ofpolicy which will not be taken until the need arises. Meanwhile no statement should be made on behalf of the Government which would prejudice this issue.18. As regards the functions at (b) a considerable number should be regardedas permanent, and the Committee have approved a detailed scheme as to how these functions should be distributed among other Departments, if and when theMinistry of Food is abolished. The Committee assume, in particular, that anational nutrition policy will be pursued more energetically than before thewar; when the Ministry of Food disappears the whole responsibility for theexecution as well as the formulation of nutrition policy will revert to the health departments, who will have the co-operation as necessary of the Agricultural and education Departments and the Ministry of Labour. The Health Departmentsought to interpret their responsibility for the health and nutrition&quot; aspects offood policy in a broad sense, as involving responsibility for co-ordinating theirown activities in that field with those of all other Departments concerned, andthey will of course, even while the Ministry of Food is still in being, continue, asthe Departments generally responsible for the health of the nation, to play their proper part in the formulation-of general policy. The Board of Trade, to whom would revert the functions of prevention or discouragement of excessive food prices and any necessary regulation of food imports, ought to take a similarlybroad view of their responsibility for safeguarding the interests of the consumer.Ministry of Home Security.19.   This Ministry&apos;s operational role will cease with the conclusion ofhostilities with Germany.   Its functions thereafter will be: (a) Temporary. Demobilisation of personnel, disposal of premises and stores, and collection of information about German experience underheavy raids&quot;.(b) Permanent. Planning against air attacks in a future war, includingstudy and research, the organisation of a permanent nucleus of theCivil Defence (General) Services (if approved) and plans for its rapid expansion at need.20.   It seems probably desirable to keep the Ministry together for somejp^-months after its operational role is over.   Thereafter a &quot;separate Ministry willnot be necessary.21. It is, however, very important that the responsibility for Civil defence planning in peacetime should be clearly defined. Before 1935 each department was responsible for those aspects of air raid precautions which were related to itspeacetime functions. In 1935 the Air Raid Precautions Department of the HomeOffice was made responsible for all aspects of air raid precautions. After theMunich crisis, however, it had become impossible for a small office to handle[28117] . B 2
operationally all the multifarious aspects of civil defence. Accordingly each department was again made responsible for those aspects which were appropriate to it. but worked in accordance with a general plan formulated under the aegis of a central Minister. This Minister (the Lord Privy Seal) operated up to theoutbreak of war under special powers, and his organisation and functions werethereafter reconstituted in the Ministry of Home Security, to which was assignedthe general responsibility, together with power to arrange for the exercise ofany of its functions by other Departments.22. The Machinery of Government Committee consider that the bestarrangement in peacetime is for a single Minister to be responsible for mostaspects of Civil Defence planning on the clear understanding that if war becomesimminent there must be immediate delegation to other Departments. The appro-priate Minister, in their view, would be the Home Secretary, who in this capacity would act for Great Britain as a wrhole. He should be assisted by inter-departmental arrangements, both official and ministerial, which would keep otherDepartments in touch and secure co-ordination with other defence plans. Liewould, of course, keep in close touch with the Secretary of State for Scotlandabout application of policy to Scotland.23. The organisation of emergency fire services and police services inScotland should, however, rest with the Secretary of State for Scotland and notwith the Home Secretary, since the former is responsible for peacetime fire brigades and police, and emergency planning cannot be separated from peace-time administration. Tor similar reasons the emergency medical and allied services should be planned by the Health Ministers and not by the Home Secretary.The Ministers exceptionally7 responsible for particular aspects of Civil defence planning would:*however, &quot;act in the closest accord with the Home Secretary as responsible for the general Civil Defence plan.Ministry of Information.24. The Machinery of Government Committee consider that it wall be essential to keep this Ministry in being until the end of the Avar with Japan,but that it should then be wound up as soon as possible. Thereafter each Govern-ment Department would be solely responsible for deciding what publicity was required in its own sphere.25. They have, however, been impressed by the number of services developedby the Ministry during the war which it will be desirable for the Governmentto retain permanently &quot;though on a suitably reduced scale. In considering this the Committee have had a general discussion about the usefulness and properfunctions of departmental public relations branches and have formed theconclusion that although these branches occasionally attract parliamentary criticism their functions, if properly conceived, are useful and indeed essential in modern government. Public relations staffs xii appropriate size will therefore continue to be necessary in a number of departments. They should not be allowedto grow too large and great care should be taken in their recruitment. public relations officers should be attached to Departments rather than to individual ministers.26. There are, however, certain services of a specialist or technical natureat present performed by the Ministry of Information which ought to be discharged by a single Department as a common service for &quot;all other Departments.This arrangement Avould lead to considerable economy in the staffing of depart-lnental public relations branches, and it might enable certain Departments which only rarely require public relations services to dispense with any7 whole-timepublic relations staff of their own.27. The services which the Committee have in mind are the distributionof Government announcements and material to the press and publicity agencies,particularly where special &quot; coverage &quot; is required; recording and filing Govern-ment photographs and making them available to Departments for purposes of&quot; visual propaganda,&quot; particularly in foreign countries; the production and dis-tribution of Government films; the timing and editing of any special Governmentpublications outside the normal Stationery Office range; and the provision of expert advice regarding the conduct of all publicity campaigns initiated by theGovernment. It will be seen that this Department would have no responsibilityfor policy, but would be purely a technical and executive agency at the serviceof the policy-forming Departments.   This would have to be made abundantly
clear in Parliament. The Department would not need day-to-day ministerialattention but should be answered for generally in Parliament by TreasuryMinisters in the same way as the Stationery Office with which indeed it may eventually be found practicable to amalgamate it. It might be called the Govern-ment Information Agency.Two other common services should be retained but not assigned to the Govern-ment Information Agency (a) the work of the Tours and Facilities Division of the Ministry, whichhas been and will continue to be of great use to other Departments,should be taken over by the Government Hospitality Fund;(&amp;) the work of the Exhibitions Division should, as before the war, be doneby the Department of Overseas Trade. That Department will inpeace have by far the largest interest and the most efficient and econo-mical arrangement will be for them to manage their own exhibitionswork and at the same time be responsible for doing similar work forother Departments as a common service.28. Opinions will differ as to the amount of publicity on the home front inwhich it is desirable for a Government to indulge in peace-time. As regardspublicity to publics overseas, however, whether in foreign countries, Dominions,India or Colonies it will probably be agreed on all hands that an energetic andskilful policy should continue to be pursued after the war. The Ministry ofInformation have built up for war purposes an elaborate organisation comprisinglarge numbers of expert staffs in overseas countries, and a central organisation in London which, in collaboration with all other Departments concerned, provides a vast mass of carefully considered material of both the &quot; news &quot; and the &quot; back-ground &quot; variety, which is used by the staffs abroad with such adaptations as thespecial needs of their station dictate.29. The Committee consider that this organisation and the technique whichhas been developed as a result of war experience ought not to be abandoned.There cannot, however, in the absence of a Ministry of Information, continueto be single and unified administration. The Committee recommend that theresponsibility for publicity abroad should be assumed by the four overseasMinisters, each in his own sphere. The four Departments should take over theappropriate parts of the Ministry of Information^ organisation and shouldtake care to ensure that at all times in future the staff, whether in london or abroad, concerned with publicity overseas is carefully selected and trained and possesses the necessary expert and technical knowledge. The Committee were informed hv-.the Minister of Information that he would make - enquiries amonghis temporary staff as to who would be willing to remain in the government service after the Ministry disappears.30. Much publicity material can be used with comparatively little modifica-tion for the purposes of two ur more of the-&quot;overseas Departments. those departments would, therefore, have to make careful arrangements forco-operation between their publicity staffs in order to prevent duplication ofwork. Since publicity abroad is of great importance to a number of otherDepartments (such as the Board of Trade, the Treasury and the Service depart-ments) inter-departmental co-operation will have to extend over a wide area.For certain services the publicity staffs of the four overseas Departments will find it useful to call on the Government Information Agency suggested inparagraph 27 above.31. It follows from this plan that whatever degree of control or guidanceis decided on respecting the overseas services of the B.B.C. should be exercised by the four overseas Departments, each in its own spher-e.32. It would be desirable to make an announcement in general terms about,the future of the Ministry of Information at an early date.Ministry of Fuel and Potver.- 33. In this Ministry there is concentrated for the first time the responsibilitytor the four main fuel and power industries, namely coal, petroleum, gas and electricity. The Minister has&apos; certain additional responsibilities in connexionwith coke ovens, coal tar, metalliferous mines and quarries.. 34. The Committee do not consider that the responsibility for these industries^ should again be split among different Departments.   It is of great
advantage that fuel and power policy should be considered as a whole and a proper balance maintained between the different industries.35. It is clear that all these industries will have special difficulties of theirown after the war, and the load of extra work will be only partially offset bythe disappearance of petrol rationing and the work involved in the wartimeprogramming &quot;of the procurement and distribution of petroleum products andto some extent of coal also. It seems inevitable that for a few years after thewar the functions will require the attention of a separate Minister of full Cabinetrank.36. It appears possible, however, that when long-term decisions of policy have been taken the functions of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, importantthough they are, will cause substantially less work and controversy, and after afew years may not be sufficient to justify a separate Department under a cabinet minister as a permanent arrangement.37. If and when this occurs it would, in the Committee&apos;s view, be whollyundesirable to assign any or all of the functions to a sub-department (likethe old Mines Department) under a Minister subordinate to a Minister of first-class status and exercising a certain degree of independent command. As soonas the responsibilities of the Minister of Fuel and Power cease to be sufficientto warrant his being a Member of the Cabinet, the Ministry should be amalgamated with another Department of State, the combined Departmentsbeing put in charge of a Minister of first-class status.38. The only Departments with which such amalgamation would seem tobe appropriate are the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Transport. It couldbe argued against the choice of the Board of Trade that that Department is responsible for the broad and general aspects of Britain&apos;s industrial and com-mercial wellbeing, and that the trend of modern administration has been to assign xo a separate Department responsibilities in relation to particular industries (such as transport, agriculture and aviation) when it has seemedappropriate that the Government should exercise a special degree of stimulation,protection, or control. The Ministry of Transport would be in some ways a more suitable choice, though it is evident that, if the recommendations made earlier inthis report are adopted, the Ministry of Transport will for some years after thewar have a number of novel and difficult problems of its own in relation to civilaviation and merchant shipping, to say nothing of&apos; the difficulties which willconfront it in connexion with roads and railways. When, however, policy on allthese matters has made some progress and administration has settled into itsstride it seems possible that an amalgamation of the Ministry of Fuel and power with the Ministry of Transport would not present an impossibly large administra-tive unit. The conditions which wall prevail some years after the war clearlycannot be foreseen with any certainty, but there would be no objection to anannouncement now that the Ministry of Fuel and Power under a separateMinister will in any event have to be retained for a number of years after the war.39. The Committee have reserved for further consideration the question ofthe proper allocation of responsibility for safety and welfare in mines andquarries, and recommendations on this point will be included in a later report.Summary of Conclusions.40. In the following summary of conclusions&quot; the recommendations whichwill require statutory authority on or before the termination of emergency powers are marked &quot;X.&quot; (The Machinery of Government Committee are not concerned with legislation which may be required by the Departments heredealt with merely in order to modify or strengthen their existing statutory powers, or perpetuate certain of their war-time powers). The recommendations on which it is suggested that there should be an early announcement of thedecision are marked &quot; Y.&quot;41. The Machinery of Government Committee recommend that the WarCabinet should (a) approve the following conclusions :  Ministry of War Transport.(i) After the emergency, the Ministry of Transport should be con-stituted in place of the present Ministry.
(ii) Responsibility for civil aviation should ultimately be transferredto the Ministry of Transport in accordance with recommendationsalready made in W.P. (44) 134.(iii) The functions in respect of docks, harbours and merchant shippingdischarged before the war by the Board of Trade, and now by the ^Ministry of War Transport, should be transferred to the Ministry of Transport on its reconstitution.Ministry of Economic Warfare.(iv) The Ministry should be wound up at the conclusion of the war inEurope-and the responsibility for economic warfare in Japanassumed by the Foreign Office.(v) The Foreign Office should be responsible in peacetime for planning for economic warfare, including plans for reconstituting thenecessary machinery.(vi) The work performed by the Ministry relating to the collection andappraisal of economic intelligence about foreign countries,including certain work for the Service and other Departments,should be transferred to Foreign Office control.YMinistry of Food.(vii) The Ministry should be retained for at least the whole of the jxtransitional period, and should, while it remains, continue todischarge its present miscellaneous functions.(viii) If and when Government buying, selling, distribution and price-control of food are no longer maintained, a separate Ministry ofFood should be dispensed with.(ix) In that event the Ministry&apos;s residual functions should be distri-buted among other Departments in accordance with the detailed scheme approved by the Machinery of Government Committee.Ministry of Home Security.(x) The Ministry should be abolished as soon as convenient after theconclusion of hostilities with Germany.(xi) After the disappearance of the Ministry its remanet functions,consequent upon wartime operations, and the general peacetimeresponsibility  for  Civil  Defence planning should,  with  the j Xexceptions indicated in paragraph 23, be assigned to the Home j secretary on the understanding that if war again becomesimminent there would have to be an immediate delegation of functions to other Departments.Ministry of Information.(xii) The Ministry should be retained for the duration of the war against japan.(xiii) In peacetime the Ministry should disappear;  each department should be solely responsible for publicity policy in its own sphereand public relations staffs of appropriate size will be necessary ina number of Departments. \(xiv) Such of the technical functions at present performed by theMinistry as will be required after the war should be maintainedas a concentrated common service to all Departments, both those with public relations staffs of their own and those without, on thelines indicated in paragraph 27 above.(xv) The expert common service organisation contemplated under (xiv)should be a purely executive Department answered for inParliament by Treasury Ministers. It might be called theGovernment Infoianation Agency and might eventually be combined with the Stationery Office.(xvi) Overseas publicity, which involves the employment of specialiststaff both at home and in overseas countries, should be theresponsibility each within his own sphere of the four overseasY
Ministers. Particular care should be taken to secure that the staff are properly selected and trained, and it will, in particular, be convenient if, on the dissolution of the Ministry, the Foreign Officetake over so far as possible its existing organisation in foreigncountries and the staff in London directing it.(xvii) There should be suitable liaison arrangements between the publicity-staffs of the four overseas Departments&apos;and between them andother Departments.(xviii) Such control or guidance as may be decided on in peace-timeregarding the overseas services of the B.B.C. should be exercisedeach in his own sphere by the four overseas Ministers.Ministry of Fuel and Power.(xix) The functions of the present Ministry should not again bedispersed.(xx) These functions will require a separate Ministry of Fuel and power under a Minister of first-class status for a number ofyears after the war.(xxi) It is desirable that if and when the responsibilities of the Ministerof Fuel and Powder are no longer sufficient to warrant his being a member of the Cabinet the Ministry should be amalgamatedwith another Department of State, the combined Departmentsbeing under a Minister of first-class status.(xxii) It is impossible to envisage the conditions wdiich will prevail atthat time, but the Department with ,which the Ministry might eventually be amalgamated is likely to be the Ministry ofTransport or possibly the Board of Trade.(b) Authorise the Ministers concerned to arrange for the preparation ofthe legislation necessary to implement the conclusions marked &quot; X &quot;above, to be introduced as and when appropriate.(c) Authorise the Ministers concerned, in consultation with the Chairmanof the Machinery of Government Committee, to announce in suitable terms the conclusions marked &quot; Y &quot; above, as and when they considerthat the occasion is opportune.(Initialled) J.
