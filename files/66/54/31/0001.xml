General demobilisation, either of the Armed Forces or of war industry,cannot take place until the end of the war against the Axis Powers and their total defeat throughout the world. The plan set out in this paper is framed onthe basis that the war against the Axis Powers is one war and that hostilitieswill first end in Europe, and it relates solely to the interim period between the defeat of Germany and the defeat of Japan. It is governed by the paramountconsideration that there can be no break in the war effort after hostilities ceasein Europe and that in association with the other Allied Powers at war with japan there, must be the maximum deployment of the forces needed to bringcomplete and final victory at the earliest possible moment.2. It follows that in the interim period the problem will not be one ofdemobilisation but of re-allocation of man-power between the Forces and industryin order best to provide for the requirements of the changed situation.3. As an essential part of this re-allocation of man-power, it will benecessary to continue the compulsory recruitment of men for the Forces in orderto bring relief to the men who have served for long periods and enable more ofthem to return to their homes. It will also be necessary to maintain the requisitecontrol over industry and labour during the interim period in which there willcontinue to be heavy and over-riding demands for munitions of war and other essential production.[28111]
4. Until the requirements for the continuation of the war against japan and for the garrisoning of occupied countries are finally known, it is impossibleto determine precisely the level at which the Armed Forces will have to be main-tained in the interim period. It is clear, however, that, taking the Armed forces as a whole, re-allocation between them and industry will be possible on asubstantial scale, although the rate of re-allocation must differ as between thethree Services.   Re-allocation must be governed by two main principles : (a) military requirements must over-ride all other considerations; and(b) the arrangements for the release of men from the Forces must be such aswill be readily understood and accepted as fair by the Forces and mustnot be too complicated for practical application.Release or Transfer from the Forces.5. The Government adhere to the view that a fair and reasonable scheme can best be secured on the basis of release according to age and length of service, butthey recognise that it will also be necessary to make a limited provision for certainurgent work of reconstruction on which a beginning must be made in the interim period. The plan accordingly provides for two separate methods of selectingmen for return from the Forces. Those selected according to age and lengthof service will form one class (Class A), and those selected on account of their qualifications for urgent reconstruction work will form a second class (Class B);these classes are separately dealt with below.6. It must be clearly understood that no man will be released or transferred from the Forces if his retention is considered necessary on military grounds,though the Services will make every effort to release men in their turn in whatevertheatre of war they may be serving.7. Men due for release or transfer from the Forces will be given an oppor-tunity to volunteer for a further period of service.Class A .8. The number of releases in Class A will correspond to the reduction inthe strength of the Forces and will be increased in consequence of the calling upof further new recruits. Men will be released by release groups based on a com-bination of age and length of war service, except that men of 50 years of age andover will be treated as a priority class to be released if they so desire before othermen. In general, war service means whole-time service in the Armed Forces sincethe 3rd September, 1939, which counts for Service pay. Owing, however, to military considerations, release will necessarily proceed at different rates in thedifferent Services. It will be necessary in some Services to deal separately withthe several branches and possibly with trades and ranks (or ratings) in those branches.9. Releases of men in Class A will begin as soon as practicable after the defeat of Germany, but there will necessarily have to be a pause during which theServices can identify the men who are to be released first and arrange for thereturn to this country of those who are overseas.10. The combination of age and length of war service will be on the basis that two months of service is equivalent to one additional year of age. On this basis,for example, a man of 22 years of age with four years&apos; service would be in thesame release group as a.man of 40 years of age with one year&apos;s service, and a man of 24 years of age with four years&apos; service would be in the same group as a man of- 30 years of age with three years&apos; service.Class B.11. The men in Class B, who will be specially transferred from the Forces,will be those identified as belonging to particular occupational classes specified by the Minister of Labour and National Service as required for certain urgentreconstruction employments. They will be mainly required to supplement thelabour force available for building houses against the time when sailors, soldiersand airmen will be returning in large numbers to civil life.12. In addition, Class B will include a limited number of individualspecialists, for whose transfer application may be made through GovernmentDepartments in accordance with existing arrangements.
13. The number of transfers in Class B will be small in proportion to thenumber of releases in Class A and transfers in Class B will not begin until a starthas been made with releases in Class A. In order to increase the releases in ClassA and to compensate for the transfers in Class B numbers of young men at presentdeferred, particularly in the munitions industries, will be called up to the Forces.The actual numbers for transfer in Class B will be determined from time to timein the light of : (i) the immediate requirements for the reconstruction employments; and(ii) the extent to which those requirements will be met by releases in Class Aand by transfer from munitions and other work at home.14. The selection of the required number of men from a particular occupa-tional class for transfer in Class B will, so far as. possible, be based on theprinciple of age and length of war service.Distinctions in the Treatment of Class A and Class B.   -15. It is essential to the scheme that there should be a clearly marked differ-ence in the treatment of the men released in Class A in their turn, and of the mentransferred to Class B out of their turn. Accordingly, the terms applying to thetwo classes will be sharply differentiated as follows : Class A.(1) On release they will be given eight weeks&apos; leave with full pay, ration allowance and, where applicable, family allowance, dependant&apos;s allow-ance and war service grant. Payment will be made by an advance onthe day of release, the remainder being paid at regular intervals.These payments will be given to assist in resettlement. In addition tothe period of eight weeks, men who are qualified will be given a further period of leave and payments as set out above in respect of foreign service; the method of assessment is set out in the Appendix. All these payments will be made for the full period, irrespective of whether the recipients are in employment or not.(2) At the expiration of leave as in (1) above they will be placed to a specialclass of Reserve, from which they would be recalled only in an extremeemergency.(3) They will be permitted to exercise their reinstatement rights and go backto their former employment. If they have no jobs to which to return,the Employment Exchanges will give them every assistance in findingemployment and will not, during the period in which they are receivingregular Service payments, regard them as subject to any powers of direction which are otherwise generally operative.Class B.(1) On transfer, they will be given three weeks&apos; leave with full pay, ration allowance and, where applicable, family allowance, dependant&apos;allowance and war service grant, and will then be placed to the Reserve.Payments due on account of foreign service will be held in suspenseuntil after the end of the war.(2) They will be directed to their reconstruction employments and this willpreserve their reinstatement rights.(3) They will be liable to be recalled individually to the Forces if theydiscontinue their reconstruction employment.(4) Men selected for transfer in Class B will not be transferred against theirwish, but it will be open to them, if they so desire, to await their normal turn for release in Class A. Once, however, a man has beentransferred in Class B he will not subsequently be eligible to apply for inclusion in Class A.Compassionate Releases.16. It will be possible for men to obtain release on compassionate groundsm accordance with the arrangements already in force.
Discharges on Medical Grounds.17. Men to be discharged on medical grounds will receive the same benefitsas men released in Class A.War Gratuities and Post-War Credits.18. In addition to the Service leave payments given on release to Class Ato assist in resettlement, or given on transfer to Class B, it is the Government^intention to introduce a scheme of war gratuities by way of reward for service.Separate announcements will be made in due course both about the amounts ofthese war gratuities and the date on which they and the post-war credits, whichare accruing in respect of other ranks&apos; service from the 1st January, 1942, willbe made available through the Post Office Savings Bank.Pensions.19. Men released or transferred who wish to claim pension for disablementdue to war service may apply to the Ministry of Pensions immediately on releaseor transfer, and if they do so any pension found to be due will take effect fromthe date of cessation of service pay and allowances.Civilian Clothing.20. Men released or transferred who have had at least six months&apos; service will be given civilian clothes in addition to such Service clothes as they will beallowed to retain.Women.21.&quot; The arrangements for release and transfer from the Forces described inthis paper will also apply to women with the addition that married women willhave priority over all others, if they so desire. The financial arrangements willbe on the same lines as for men. Civilian clothing will not be provided, but a cash grant and clothing coupons will be given instead. Certain articles of Serviceclothing will be retained.Appendix.Assessment of Leave and Payments in respect of Foreign Service.The practices of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force as regards leave for foreign service have differed, and in order to introduce an approximateequality between the three Services, it is necessary to have differing rules for the calculation of the leave to be given in respect of foreign service to men released inthe interim period.In the case of the Royal Navy, it has been the practice to grant seven days&apos;leave for each period of six months&apos; foreign service at the end of each tour. Inthe case of the Army and the Royal Air Force, comparatively little foreign serviceleave has been granted hitherto.In the circumstances, the existing practice of the Royal Navy will becontinued during the interim period and those released from the Army and theRoyal Air Force will have all their foreign service aggregated and their periodof leave or payments assessed at the rate of one day for each completed monthof foreign service subject to a minimum of six months&apos; foreign service.
