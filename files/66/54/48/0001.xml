THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.-,-j-Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 498.oth September, 1944.WAR CABINET.STATE MONOPOLY OF THE AIR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE Secretary of State for Air has proposed (W.P. (44) 268 and W.P. (44)277) that not only all overseas air services but all internal air services shouldbe in the hands of a nationally-owned monopoly. It&apos; is not quite clear whether there are to be two monopolies or one monopoly. In any case no private citizenin this country is to be allowed to carry passengers or goods by air to any foreignor domestic destination. He may build a ship, ply a ferry, or let out a canoeon hire for the afternoon. He may, subject to licence to avoid unnecessarycompetition, run an omnibus or a lorry service or own his own taxicab. Butonly a State monopoly is to be allowed to perform any of these functions oncecontact is lost with the surface of the ground or of the water. So amazing adoctrine deserves investigation.It is no exaggeration to say that the whole future of this country and ofthe Empire is bound up with the development of aviation. It is becoming increasingly clear that aviation will dominate the warfare of the future. Itis not merely that fighter and bomber planes will play in ever larger measuretheir specialised part or that the naval battles of the future will rarely be foughtat less than a hundred miles range. More than that. The armies of the future will comprise an ever-larger proportion of paratroops, and even those troopsthat themselves move on the ground will relyr more and more on air transport for their supplies. The transport plane for men and goods may well be the decisive military factor of the future, as the merchant vessel, the train andthe motor vehicle have been hitherto. The requisite planes, trained stall and manufacturing plant can no more be provided out of Air Force Estimates thanthe merchant ships or lorries required in this war could have been furnished outof Navy or Army estimates. They can only be provided by a development of civilaviation proportionate to the total of our defensive requirements.Civil aviation is destined, however, to play an even more important partin the peaceful development of the world. The speed and unlimited flexibilityof air travel will bring about a revolution in the economic and social progress of mankind even greater than that brought about by the railway train, the steam-ship and the motor-car combined. It is not only a question of high-speed trans-oceanic services. The aeroplane has abolished rivers and narrow seas. Itdemands no costly capital expenditure on roads or rails. It consequently affordsscope for an immense multiplication of passenger and light goods-carryingfacilities. It will be as natural to take an air bus from Brighton to Dieppe asto take it to the DeviFs Dyke, to fly Colchester oysters to Paris as to London.We are only at the beginning of the helicopter period when, for all but high-speed long-range flights, the landing ground will be as much a normal adjunctof the ordinary private house as the garage has become in the last twenty years.It is vital that we should be in the very forefront of this great world revo-lution. We are at present grievously behindhand as compared with the UnitedStates in the actual development of machines and organisation even moreperhaps in outlook and vision. But taking a longer view we have immenseadvantages in our central position, not only for European, but for world air traffic,and the scattered distribution of our territories over the world should be a powerful incentive, not only to link&quot; them up effectively, but, in the process, topick up a large volume of traffic on the way.[28154]
It is obvious that a matter of such paramount importance, above all in thisearly and largely experimental stage, cannot be left to unaided private enter-prise, to the mere unguided and uncontrolled profit motive. The State mustintervene, both to encourage and help and also to direct. The question is what form that intervention, that direction, are to take.Clearly they should, in the first instance, be directed to all those measureswhich are calculated to assist aviation generally, by whomever undertaken, andwhich are outside the capacity of ordinary private enterprise. It is for theState to provide research in every aspect, not only by conducting such researchdirectly through its own staffs, but by placing such facilities as wind tunnels,testing&apos; of materials, &amp;c, at the disposal of the public. Similarly, it is for theState to provide the aerodromes, making them equally available at the lowestpossible charge for all operators, just as roads and harbours and lighthousesare made available to all users. Thirdly, it is for the State, if it wishes certainroutes to be developed for political or strategic reasons, or certain standards ofspeed or comfort attained, beyond what private enterprise can afford to ventureupon, to see to it that these routes or standards are assured. It may directlyown air traffic over a certain route or it may subsidise it. whether by a singlecorporation selected for that purpose, or by competing companies. It may, inother cases, subsidise services complying with certain stipulated conditions. Itmay. in order to avoid purely wasteful competition, control by licence the numberof competitors over certain routes, domestic or overseas. But is it necessary, forany of these purposes, to destroy all private initiative, competition and experi-ment? Is that really calculated to promote the most effective development of aviation ?We must remember that aviation is still largely, in the experimental stage and. for that reason., is the very last subject to be, entrusted to a monopoly,whether State-owned or private.&quot; A monopoly is by its nature disinclined toexperiment. Its structure is hierarchical, and if those at the head.of it disbelievein a new idea and most new ideas are at first sight obviously unpractical andabsurd the new idea will never get its chance, for no one else (in this country at least) will be allowed to develop it. In time of war, when competition is amatter of life and death and finance does not count, these objections nury notapply. But what would Parliament or the Treasury say in peace to the&quot; wasteful &quot; expenditure of millions on an experimental type which, if it fails,will be held to have been bound to fail, or on an unpromising route wmich has failed to attract traffic ?I have always thought it was common ground that the case for public ownership wras strongest in respect of services universally required and providedby established methods not susceptible of any startling new developments. Water,gas, electric light, municipal transport, have long been recognised as suitable forsuch ownership. There may be a good case for nationalising the railways Iam not urging it myself. We have been mining coal for centuries, and the range of possible methods of extraction is fairlyr well known. There might be a case for a State monopoly there. . Even shipping has its w-eli-established technique.But is any one going seriously to suggest that all ships, including even barges and launches on our rivers and canals, should be owned by a State monopoly ?And if the principle of monopoly is manifestly absurd when applied to water transport why is it likely to produce good results in the new and experimentalfield of air transport?There may well be a good case for the State owning the service on particularroutes, or for a particular purpose such as internal postal delivery, or subsidisinga particular chosen intrumeiit for such purpose. That is likely to apply to the fast direct service from here to Australia and New Zealand or to other similarroutes where political and general economic considerations outweigh theimmediate financial loss. But is that really a reason for not allowing other organisations to develop routes which are likely to pay for themselves, or paywith a much smaller measure of assistance ? For years we subsidised&apos; the CunardLine in order to provide an Atlantic service of a certain speed. In more recentyears we were contemplating, with the Dominions concerned, a jointly subsidisedline in order&apos;to secure a British passenger service in the Pacific comparable withthe heavily subsidised American services. Has anybody Wer suggested that we ought therefore to put all shipping under a single monopoly ? Or that&apos;the crews of &quot;the Cunard suffered deplorably in morale&quot;&quot; because they only won the blueribbon of the Atlantic with State assistance?Nor can I see why the State should not subsidise different companies on different routes, or even, within limits, competing services over the same routes.
To talk of the State &quot; competing against itself &quot; is surely to miss the whole point.The State is not competing against itself when it spends vast sums on helpingits youth to compete against each other at school and in after life. It is promotingeducation. It is not competing against itself when it provides lighthouses orharbours for competing shipping lines. It is promoting the national interest in shipping. And if, directly or indirectly, it subsidises competing air lines, itmay be fully justified in doing so if the result is to increase enterprise and efficiency in aviation. Nor is the object of subsidy to enable private capital tomake excessive profits. Its object is to overcome difficulties and inevitable lossesup to a point at which efficiency can enable normal profits to be earned. Whetherthe object in view is. best achieved by a State-owned service or by a singlesubsidised service or by competing services, subsidised or unsubsiclised, is a matter for practical consideration in each case. The one method that is least calculated to promote efficiency and bold progress is that of a single monopoly covering all services, great and small. That is particularly true of the development of small-scale local services within this country or to Eire and adjacent parts of theContinent.What, indeed, is to be the relation of the proposed Government monopoly ormonopolies to air traffic under other national authorities? What is to happen if british shipping companies set up a Transatlantic service in Eire, with or without an Eire government subsidy ? Will their planes be forbidden to pick up or deliverpassengers in this country? If a Brighton hotel company has a working arrange-ment with a French hotel company to fly visitors over for golf and lunch inFrance, will it wait for the Government monopoly to inaugurate the service orwill not the service inevitably be provided by the French company ? Will that be good for British aviation? If the railwav comoanies in this country wish to run helicopter buses to collect local traffic in passengers or fresh vegetables, is nosuch service to be allowed until those who need it and realise its possibilities canpersuade the monopoly to provide it? Again, if they are forbidden to developfeeder traffic by air is a firm like Ffarrods or a newspaper like The Times to beforbidden to serve its customers by its own air delivery vans ? What aboutshipping companies who may wish to fly passengers straight from board ship totheir various inland destinations? Then what about construction? Is there tobe a monopoly of that as well ?If ever there was a subject suitable for the effective combination of Stateencouragement, guidance and control with the maximum of individual experiment,initiative and competition, it is this new domain of aviation. If ever there wasa subject in which the dead hand of monopoly might be calculated to do themaximum of harm it is in this same field. My plea to the War Cabinet wouldbe to add one more to the well-known list of the four freedoms : Freedom to Fly.L. S. A.India Office, 5th September, 1944.
