this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 484.30th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.WARNING TO NEUTRALS NOT TO GRANT ASYLUM TO ENEMYLEADERS AND WAR CRIMINALS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 29th June, 1943,1 circulated a paper (W.P. (43) 286) to my colleaguesabout a warning to neutrals against granting asylum to enemy leaders and war criminals. I also circulated a draft declaration which had been prepared inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General. On the7th July, 1943, the Cabinet decided that an approach to the United NationsGovernments on the lines suggested was premature and that the question shouldbe brought up again in three months&apos; time. Later in July, owing to the situationthen developing in Italy, it was, however, deemed advisable, in case ItalianFascists should attempt to take refuge in Switzerland, to make a joint Anglo-American (and where they had diplomatic representatives) Russian approach to the neutral Governments. As a result, the more general proposals referred toabove were allowed to lapse.2. I think we have now reached a stage of the war when it would be timelyto revive the question of preventing neutrals granting asylum to Nazi leaders and war criminals. It is true that the Lord Chancellor gave a wider -applicationto the warning in regard to Fascists when he said in the House of Lords onthe 7th December, 1943, that &apos;&apos; the earlier warning, which in itself was primarilyaddressed to the question of Italian refugees, of course is now extended and wellunderstood to be extended to the even more important case of German refugees,and the Declaration on German Atrocities which has been issued as a result ofthe Moscow Conference is addressed in the same way to warn neutral States thatwe, who are carrying the burden of the war and are determined that it shouldend in the re-establishment of decent rights for all free men, must call upon theseneutrals to recognise that they, too, have some responsibility and should not receive such refugees.&quot; The war has now reached a stage at which a furtherauthoritative pronouncement seems desirable at the highest level and on behalfof the three major allies. I would like, therefore, to revive the draft declaration with was put forward in June 1943, the terms of which are in my opinion stillappropriate, with one slight modification, namely, the omission of the last sevenwords &quot; and as an act unfriendly to themselves.&quot; A copy of the draft amendedaccordingly is annexed.3. If my colleagues agree that action on the above lines would be timely, Iwould propose that it should take the form of a joint declaration by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the United States Government and the Soviet Government, ratherthan a further joint approach through the diplomatic channel to the neutral governments. This would get round the difficulty that the Soviet Governmentare not represented with the majority of the neutrals. It would also secure themaximum authority and publicity for the statement and avoid giving the neutral governments any further opportunity to enter into unprofitable argument uponthe legal aspects of the question.4. I should be grateful for the authority of the War Cabinet to consult the United States and Soviet Governments on these lines.12499   [28118]
5. It will be noted that the draft, declaration does not actually refer to thecase of Quislings. Except where Quislings are specifically charged with havingcommitted, or having- abetted the commission of, a war crime, their offences havebeen committed against the laws of their own country, and are therefore by generalagreement the affair of the particular country directly concerned. It would therefore, in my opinion, considerably weaken the general effect of the proposed declaration to refer specifically to Quislings. I think that neutral governments may in any case be expected to show marked hesitation in giving shelter to such persons, if only irom the point of view of their future relations with the AlliedGovernment in question, whose primary concern this is. I should add that theUnited States Government recently instructed their representatives in Berne,Lisbon, Madrid and Stockholm informally to seek an assurance from the Govern-ments to which they are accredited that they would not grant asylum to Axisleaders or their tools. His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in these capitals have been instructed to speak informally in support of their United States colleagues, butto confine themselves to emphasising the endless trouble that neutral countries will be laying up for themselves if they allow such persons to enter their territory.A. E.Foreign Office, 30th August, 1944.ANNEX.Revised Draft Declaration.The Governments of1. Conscious of the responsibility which rests upon them for restoring,through the victory of the United Nations, the rule of justice throughout theworld:2. Believing that the due punishment of war crimes and offences is anessential step to that end;3. Recalling the grievous suffering caused to great numbers of innocentpeople by reason of the present war and by the crimes against law and humanitycommitted during the course of it by the leaders of the enemy nations, theirsubordinates and also by their accomplices in other countries;4. Being resolved that persons responsible for causing that suffering shallmot escape retribution; and believing that no neutral country would wish to afford them assistance in so doing;5. Reaffirm their determination to seek out those concerned wherever theymay be found;6. Considering that, after the victory of the United Nations, neutral countries also will have their contribution to make towards the restoration of the rule of justice throughout the world, and are no less concerned than the partiesto the present Declaration to secure that war criminals should not escape justice and that war crimes should be punished;7. Call upon all neutral countries to refuse asylum to persons fleeing fromthe consequences of their crimes or whose object, or probable object, in seekingasylum is to avoid falling into the hands of the United Nations, or who seek itin consequence or in anticipation of the defeat of their country or of its occupation by the forces of the United Nations;8. And declare that they will regard any shelter, assistance or protection given to such persons as a violation of the principles for which they are fighting.
