THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 462.23rd August, 1944.WAR CABINET.BELLIGERENT STATUS FOR POLISH UNDERGROUND ARMY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 21st August (W.M. (44) 109th Conclusions, Minute 3) the WarCabinet agreed that I should prepare, for their further consideration, a draft declaration to be issued by His Majesty&apos;s Government and, if possible, theUnited States Government also, to the effect that we recognise the Polish Under-ground Army as a fully combatant force entitled to normal treatment underthe laws and customs of war.2. I accordingly circulate a draft which is based on the model of thestatement issued by General Eisenhower last month to protect the French Maquis.As my colleagues are aware from earlier discussions, there are several serious difficulties in this problem, but I am confident that the enclosed draft has evadedall the major difficulties and that it is as far as we can go to satisfy the Poles.3. The Polish Prime Minister has again pressed in the most insistentterms for the issue of such a declaration. The position at Warsaw is becoming increasingly grave and, in. the absence of more effective support, such adeclaration, which should be issued as soon as possible, would be valuable in maintaining Polish morale at home. It should also have a good effect amongthe Polish troops under our command.4. I recommend, therefore, that I may be authorised to publish this declaration at once, informing the United States Government and asking themto associate themselves with it.A. E.Foreign Office, 23rd August, 1944.Draft Declaration.His Majesty&apos;s Government are receiving numerous reports which show that members of the Polish Home Army, who are engaged in active operations forthe liberation of their country, are being treated by the German militaryauthorities in a manner contrary to the laws and customs of war.His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore make this formal declaration :1. The Polish Home Army, which is now mobilised, constitutes a combatantforce operating under the orders and directions of the Polish High Command,and forms an integral part of the Polish Armed Forces.2. Members of the Polish Home Army are instructed to conduct their military operations in accordance with the rules of war, and in so doing theybear their arms openly against the enemy. They operate under responsiblecommanders. They are provided with a distinctive emblem or with Polishuniforms.3. In these circumstances reprisals against members of the Polish HomeArmy violate the rules of war by which Germany is bound. His Majesty&apos;^Government, together with their Polish Allies, are determined to track downand punish all those responsible for such crimes. Steps to this end are already being taken.12490   [2806G]
