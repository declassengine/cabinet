Printed for the War Cabinet, August, 1944Copy No.TOP secret the circulation of this   paper  has  been strictly   limited.    It   is   issued   for   the personal use of w.P. (44) 45321st August, 1944.WAR CABINETMANPOWER REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ARMY, 1944/45REVISED ASSESSMENTMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI circulate a revised assessment of Army manpower requirements for the balance of1944, prepared by the General Staff in the light of the latest available information.This review bears out the previous forecast that, given a larger intake in July and august, it should be possible to make some reduction in the run down of the Army. Thepresent estimate is that by the end of 1944 there will be a loss of the fighting elements oftwo infantry divisions and three armoured brigades.It has been possible also to reduce substantially the demand for the last four monthsof 1944, representing the numbers needed to prevent a further loss in the first half of1945.   This is because:-I. Casualties in the early stages in Normandy were below estimate.2. Very substantial internal savings have been achieved, notwithstanding our inability to reduce Anti-Aircraft Command Owing to DIVER; as many menas possible from these savings are being and will be retrained as infantry and armoured reinforcements.Although the period of overseas service is being reduced to 4% years or less,nevertheless provision must be made also for leave. In addition it is necessary toprovide for an interchange of personnel of long service in those formations which willfight in the Far East. I therefore ask the War Cabinet to approve an intake of 75,000men for the Army from September to December inclusive, together with the numbers for the Women&apos;s Services and for civilians as set out in the Annexure.PJ.G.The War Office,21st August, 1944.
ANNEXUREMANPOWER REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ARMY WITH particular reference TO THE ESTIMATED POSITION BY THE END  OF JUNE,1945,  AND THE  INTAKES REQUIRED  DURING  SEPTEMBER TODECEMBER, 19441. In W.P. (44) 316 it was estimated that, given an intake of 190,000 men and some19,800 A.T.S. between July and December, 1944 60,000 men to come in July and august-and assuming internal savings up to 25,000 could be achieved, it might bepossible to prevent the Army from running down in 1944 by more than three divisions&apos;worth of Infantry and two brigades&apos; worth of Armour; and to hold the Army at thisreduced strength during the first half of 1945.2. This forecast has been re-examined taking into account the latest information regarding casualties, necessary adjustments in commitments, and the actual allotmentsof men and women approved for July and August, 1944, amounting to 49,500 and4,500 respectively. The decision that planning should be based on the assumption thatthe war with Germany will not go on after the end of June, 1945, does not affect thepresent assessments. These deal only with the requirements of new intakes during thebalance of 1944 which will be trained and employed by mid-1945.A. Position at the end of 1944.3. It now appears probable that we shall be able to achieve internal savings from:  (a) Reductions in commitments, using the men released either as reinforcements intheir own arms or retraining them, where possible &apos;as Infantry, in time for employment this year. These reductions amount to some 56,000 and havebeen&quot; found largely by a cut in anti-aircraft in the Mediterranean, India,and Normandy.(b) Casualties to date being below estimates.   The overall position for all armsfor the months of April to July inclusive shows a saving of some 44,000,representing about 38 per cent, of the total estimated casualties. This savingwas largely because the casualties in the early phases of OVERLORD were much lighter than had been expected.4. The saving in casualties is not, however, correspondingly reflected in Armourand Infantry. In these arms the casualties after the early stages have been above theestimates, though the world-wide position has been partly offset by lighter losses in italy. The general trend of casualties figures is not such as to justify any reduction ofthe previous gross estimate for the rest of the year; but to the extent which it is found possible to do so, any marked surplus of reinforcements in other arms which may accruewill be retrained for Infantry or Armour.5. Account has also been taken of the fact that the relief of men with long service is at present resulting in 14,000 men being away from their units, and that from Octoberwhen the period of continuous overseas service is to be reduced to 4J years or less,the figure will rise to 25,000.6. The resultant position confirms the general conclusions of the review in Junethat a run down in die fighting strength of the Army could not be avoided. It now appears likely, however, to be rather less in Infantry, but in Armour rather more.The revised estimate of the loss by the end of 1944 is:  &apos; Two, instead of three, divisions&apos; worth of Infantry.Three, instead of two, brigades&apos; worth of Armour.B. Position by the end of June, 1945.7. If a further run down in fighting strength during the first half of 1945 is to be prevented it will be necessary for the Army to receive an intake during the months ofSeptember to December inclusive of 25,000 fit men suitable for Infantry and Armour.8. In arriving at this figure full account has been taken of:  (a) The transfer to Infantry and Armour of the maximum possible number ofsoldiers from formations cannibalized, having regard to medical categoryand suitability.   The estimate is some 28 per cent, of the total numbers.
(b) Absorption within their own arms of all remaining men from units actuallycannibalized. In assessing the numbers likely to be available fromcannibalization due regard has had to be paid to the limitations in respectof a reduction in rearward services as and when formations are cannibalized,as indicated in W.P. (44) 316, paragraph 7.g  It is essential, however, that there should be a margin to cover:  (a) Leave, which can no longer be postponed.(6) Additional intakes which will become trained during the first half of 1945, inorder to begin an interchange of personnel, within formations and units, sothat these formations, on completion of the war with Germany, can be moved to the East without delay and so release men to civil life from the Army moresmoothly. In this connection, even on the basis that the war with Germanycontinues until the middle of 1945, the possibility of moving divisions to theEast earlier must be faced.For this margin 50,000 men are needed, making a total requirement of 75,000 men.Other Categories of Personnel.10. The position with regard to the other categories of personnel, including theWomen&apos;s Services, is briefly as follows:  (a) A.T.S.The actual shortage at 30th June was 500 more than anticipated, andthe revised demand for the second half-year is 20,500. Deducting the alloca-tion for July and August of 4,500, the requirement for September-Decemberis therefore 16,000. To the extent that this is nol met an increase in the intake of men will be required.(b) Nursing Officers.The previous estimate for normal wastage and battle casualties has.proved too low and it is now necessary also to cover relief of Nursing officers with long service overseas. The revised demand during the period August-December is 1,500.(c) V.A.Ds.Against the allocation of 1,035 fQr io44. only 415 have been received upto the end of June.   The requirement for the last six months is 620.(d) Civilians.The intake of non-industrial civilians received has failed even to coverwastage. The new requirement is a demand for the original allocation of1,500, plus a further 1,200 to cover wastage for the remainder of the year a total of 2,700.Summary of Requirements for the Balance of 1944.11. The Army requires the following intakes during the period September-December, 1944:  (a) Men 75,000, plus a number equal to any shortfall in the allocation of A.T.S.against demand.(&amp;) A.T.S. 16,000.(c) Nursing Officers 1,500, less any received in August.(d) V.A.Ds. 620, less any received&apos;in July and August.(e) Non-industrial civilians 2,700.021st august, 1944.(b44/188)   90   s/44   w.o.p.   1ss31
