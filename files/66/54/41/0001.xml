September 1944.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited,   it is issued for the personal use of.................................   ....................TOP SECRET Copy No.W.P. (44) 491.1st September, 1944.WAR CABINET.OPERATION &quot;NEST EGG.&quot;Report by the Chiefs of Staff.PLANS are in preparation for the despatch of a force to the Channel islands in the event of the surrender of the German garrison.2. These plans envisage the despatch of a force consisting of three infantry battalions (one Regular, one Territorial Army, one composite Home Defence),one A.A. regiment (2 Heavy and 2 Light A.A. batteries), two Field Companies,Royal Engineers, and ancillary troops. This force is considered to be theminimum necessary to deal with the situation : there are some 15,000-20.000Germans in the Islands.3. The force has been scraped together from troops available in this countryand may lack initially the cohesion and joint training to be expected in a formation drawn from 21st Army Group. General Eisenhower has. however,reported that he cannot, at the present stage of the battle; hold forces availablefor a speedy occupation of the Channel Islands in the event of a sudden Germansurrender.4. Measures are now in train to prepare and concentrate by the1st September the troops lequired for this force. The necessary shipping will then be held at seven days&apos; readiness to sail. If the force were to be held atshorter notice than seven days, the effect on the &apos;&apos; Overlord&apos;&apos; maintenanceprogramme of locking up this quantity of coastal shipping would be considerable.5. We ask the War Cabinet to take note of the plans which are being madefor the occupation of the Channel Islands when the Germans are ready to surrender, and to give approval to the expedition being held at not less than seven days&apos; notice to sail.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.C. PORTAL.ANDREW CUNNINGHAM.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,1st September, 1944.[28136]
