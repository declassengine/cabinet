THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT        printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET. /Copy No.   ggW.P. (44) 451,26^ August, 1944.WAR CABINET.STAFFING OF THE COLONIAL SERVICE IN THE immediate post-WAR PERIOD.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN W.P. (44) 407 the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs circulated astatement which he has since made public on the subject of post-war recruitment for the Foreign Service.The Colonial Service also is in very great need of large reinforcements ofnew recruits and the same considerations apply as in the case of the foreign service. After consultation with the Prime Minister and the Minister ofLabour and National Service, I am therefore proposing to issue a Statement onthe lines of the draft included in the annex to this paper.I shall be obliged if any of my colleagues who have, any observations to make on this proposal will let me know before the end of August.0. S.Colonial Office, 2Qth August, 1944ANNEX.Statement on Post-War Recruitment for the Colonial Service.THE war has inevitably imposed a great strain upon the Colonial Service :and the present shortage of staff in relation to the heavy responsibilities whichthe future will place upon the Service makes the problem of post-war recruitmenta matter of special moment. ^Since the outbreak of war, many hundreds of serving officers have been released for duty with the Armed Forces. On the other hand, fresh recruitmenthas naturally been cut to a minimum, and for certain branches has virtually ceased to exist.Leave to temperate climates, which is essential if the health and efficiency of externally-recruited officers are to be maintained, is in general much overdue.In the Colonial Service in the Far East, the majority of these officers are in japanese concentration camps, and many of them will not be fit for furtherservice, while the remainder will require long periods of recuperation.A large number of officers by the end of the war will be due, or overdue, for retirement. Most of the rest will, as soon as practicable, need a substantial amount of recuperative leave if their efficiency is to be i-estored.For the above reasons, the. existing cadres will, at the end of the war,be much below their pre-war strength. But it is already clear that the pre-war strength will be a good deal below that required for our future tasks. an expansion in many directions will be urgently required in order to give effect tothe widely conceived plans for social progress and material development withwhich it is proposed to press forward immediately circumstances permit.[28086]
Under the schemes in prospect, it is hoped that the staffing difficulties willbe relieved in future by the recruitment of Government servants from local com-munities in the Colonies on a much wider scale than in the past. But it is clearthat there will still be a wide field for the employment of externally recruitedofficers, and fresh recruitment of such officers will have to be undertaken aspromptly as possible.It is accordingly the intention to make arrangements whereby, after the defeat of Germany, candidates from the armed forces 07- from amongst those employed on other forms of war work can be considered for appointment to thevarious branches of the Colonial Service, subject of course to the requirements ofthe military situation. Information about these arrangements will be madeavailable to all those concerned when the time comes and full details will begiven respecting the wide variety of openings which will exist in^ the colonial service.
