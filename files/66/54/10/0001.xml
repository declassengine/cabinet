THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.o0SECRET. Copy No.   ,W.P. (44) 460.24th A ugust, 1944.WAR CABINET.REDISTRIBUTION OF SEATS.1. Representation of the City of London.2. Number of  Seats to be  assigned  to scotland and to Wales and Monmouth.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.IT is necessary to ask the War Cabinet to consider again two matters whichwere dealt with at the Meeting of the 20th July, namely, the question of the representation of the City of London and the question of the number of seats tobe assigned to Scotland and to Wales and Monmouth.Representation of the City of London.1. On the question whether the City of London should continue to have two members or whether the number should be reduced to one, we understand thatthe view taken by the War Cabinet on the 20th July was that it would be desirableto avoid a decision on this question at the present stage, and that it should beleft to the Boundary Commissioners in the first instance to consider whether aspecial case exists for leaving the City as a double-Member constituency, with theresult that the question would not arise for decision until a Bill is introduced togive effect to a general scheme of redistribution recommended by the BoundaryCommissioners.For the reasons given in the Appendix to this Memorandum we do not thinkit is practicable to give the Boundary Commissioners the function of considering -this question, and we suggest that the best way of effecting the object which theCabinet had in view will be to provide in the forthcoming Redistribution of SeatsBill that there shall be no alteration of the boundaries of the Parliamentaryconstituency of the City of London, and that the City shall return such numberof Members, not exceeding two, as may be determined by the subsequent Act whichwill have to be passed in due course to give effect to the first general scheme of redistribution recommended by the Boundary Commissioners.2. The programme proposed by the Speaker&apos;s Conference is that the boundary Commissioners shall first divide the twenty abnormally large con-stituencies which have electorates of over 100,000 and that thereafter &quot;the boundary Commissioners shall begin to prepare a full redistribution schemeimmediately after the completion of the temporary scheme of sub-division ofabnormally large constituencies.&quot; Effect is to be given to this first general schemeof redistribution of constituencies throughout the United Kingdom by meansof a Bill. Subsequent schemes of redistribution recommended from time to time by the Boundary Commissioners will be effected by means of Orders in Councilsubject to affirmative resolutions.Under the plan we propose, settlement of the question whether the City is tohave one Member or two Members can be effected when a Bill is introduced togive effect to the first general scheme of redistribution, but cannot be postponedbeyond that date because after that date the procedure for giving effect to schemesof redistribution will be by Order in Council and not by Bill.[28069]
3. The Cabinet conclusions of the 20th July contemplated inserting in theforthcoming Bill provisions which would require the Boundary commissioners to deal with the City of London on the same lines as provincial double-member constituencies. As shown in the Appendix, any such course would entail great difficulties. Under the plan which we propose the Boundary Commissioners willhave no functions in connection with the City of London. They will simply set aside as available for the City of London two of the total number of seatsavailable for England; and if when the Bill to give effect to their scheme of redistribution is introduced Parliament should fix the number of seats for theCity of London at one, the total number of Members in the House of Commonswill be one less than the figure contemplated by the Boundary Commissioners asa possible maximum.Representation of Scotland and of Wales and Monmouth.4. The Speakers Conference recommended that, while the total number ofMembers of the House of Commons for Great Britain should remain substantiallyas at present (i.e., 591 excluding University seats), there should be no reductionin the present number of Members of the House of Commons for Scotland or for wales and Monmouthshire (i.e., 71 and 35 respectively). The War Cabinet,however, at their meeting on the 20th July decided, subject to a report being madeto the Prime Minister, that for the purpose of the first general redistributionthe principle should be accepted that there should be no reduction in the presentnumber of Members for Scotland or for Wales and Monmouth; but that theGovernment should not commit themselves to the acceptance of this principlethereafter.5. The Secretary of State for Scotland feels strongly that any departure from the unanimous recommendation of the Speakers Conference on this subject is undesirable and that to limit the assurance of a continuation of the presentScottish and Welsh representation to the period between the first and secondgeneral redistribution is bound to excite apprehension and controversy. In theSecretary of State for Scotland&apos;s view nothing is to be gained by inviting suchcontroversy at the present time. It appears to him that if Parliament is preparedto allocate 71 seats to Scotland and 35 seats to Wales at the time of the firstgeneral redistribution it is impossible to contemplate any modification in these numbers unless in the future there is some radical alteration in the ratio of theScottish or Welsh electorates to the electorate of Great Britain as a whole.Even if such a radical alteration took place and an adjustment in the relativenumbers of Members representing England, Wales and Scotland had to be made,the adjustment need not necessarily be effected by reducing the number ofMembers for Scotland or for Wales. The Secretary of State for Scotlandtherefore strongly recommends that the proposal of the Speaker&apos;s conference should be accepted without modification, leaving any subsequent adjustment inthe total Membership of the House of Commons, or in the representation ofEngland, Scotland or Wales, to be effected by legislation if a situation arises in which such an adjustment becomes imperative.6. As the War Cabinet is aware, the Home Secretary finds it difficult toadvise that such a permanent commitment should be accepted.7. We have discussed the matter together and we are agreed that, if theWar Cabinet are unable to accept without qualification, as the Secretary ofState for Scotland proposes, the recommendation of the Speaker&apos;s conference that there should-be no reduction in the present number of Members for scotland or for Wales and Monmouthshire, the right course is to provide in the forthcomingBill that the number of constituencies in Scotland shall be not less than 71 (andin Wales and Monmouthshire not less than 35) until Parliament shall otherwisedetermine; and to add a statutory requirement that each of the three boundary commissions shall review annually the aggregate number of electors for thewhole of Great Britain and for England, for Scotland and for Wales and monmouthshire respectively, and shall make a special report to Parliamentwhenever the number of electors obtained by dividing the aggregate for England,for Scotland or for Wales and Monmouthshire by the number of Membersassigned to that -country differs by more than 25 per cent, from the number of electors obtained by dividing the aggregate for Great Britain by the total numberof Members for Great Britain. If, for example, the electoral quota for GreatBritain were about 53,000 as it would have been on the basis of the 1939electorate it would be. the duty of the Scottish or Welsh Boundary Commission
to make a special report to Parliament whenever the figure given by dividing thetotal Scottish electorate by 71, or the total Welsh electorate by 35, was less than about 40,000\ The average number of electors per Member in Scotland, on thebasis of the 1939 electorate, was in fact nearly 45,000; so that a substantialalteration in the ratio of the Scottish electorate to the Great Britain electoratewould have to take place before a review would, on this formula, become necessary.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall,24th A ugust, 1944.APPENDIX.1. The number of electors for the City as shown in the 1939 Register was38,022. Of these 13,622 were electors registered in respect of their spouses&apos;occupation of business premises. When the Spouses&apos; Vote is abolished the electorate of the City on the 1939 basis will be reduced to 24,400. At the presenttime the electorate must be much lower, as many of the business premises havebeen destroyed. Possibly some of .them will be restored before the firstredistribution, but, so far as can be foreseen, the electorate of the City at thedate of the first redistribution cannot exceed 24,400 and will probably be less.2. The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended that the standard unit ofelectorate for each M.P. should be a quota ascertained by dividing the totalelectorate in Great Britain by the total number of seats in Great Britain otherthan university seats. It is estimated that the result will be to give a figure ofabout 53,000.The Speaker&apos;s Conference also recommended that the Boundary Com-missioners should not be required to modify an existing constituency if itselectorate falls short of or exceeds the quota by not more than approximately25 per cent. If, therefore, the standard unit be 53,000, the limits of tolerationfor single-Member constituencies will be 39,000 and 66,000.3. As regards double-Member constituencies, the Speaker&apos;s Conferencerecommended that, apart from the City of London, &quot; no county or borough shall continue to return two Members if the electorate falls short of double the quotaby more than approximately 15 per cent.&quot; The limit of toleration, therefore,for a double-Member constituency will be an electorate of about 90,000, andthe Speaker&apos;s Conference did not contemplate giving discretion to the BoundaryCommissioners to leave undisturbed a provincial double-Member constituencyof which the electorate is below the limit of toleration. If, however, such a constituency is within the limit of toleration, the Conference recommended thatdiscretion should be left to the Boundary Commission to maintain it if a special case can be made out. Their recommendation reads : &quot; Constituencies at presentreturning two Members shall be abolished except where, after local enquiry bythe Boundary Commissioners, it is found in any particular case that abolitionis undesirable.&quot;4. To enable the Boundary Commission to deal with the City of london as one of the double-Member constituencies with regard to which they are toconsider &quot;after local enquiry&quot; whether &quot;abolition is undesirable,&quot; it wouldbe necessary to refrain from applying any limit of toleration to the double-Member constituencies. If this were done, the Boundary Commissioners wouldhave discretion to find &quot; after local enquiry &quot; that abolition is undesirable notonly in the case of the City of London, but in other cases where an electoratemay be found to fall below the limit of toleration. Whether such cases will befound on the first review is uncertain. The double-Member constituencies&apos;ofDerby, Norwich and Blackburn had in 1941 estimated electorates of 81,300,81,700 and 83,700, but each of these boroughs has been enlarged, and it is possiblethat when the boundaries of the Parliamentary constituency are adjusted tothe borough boundaries the electorate will be found to be within the limit oftoleration. Moreover, it is arguable that the non-application of the limit oftoleration to these provincial constituencies would be unlikely to have any practical consequence, because the probability is that the Boundary Commissionerswill be unable to find a special case for allowing them to continue as double-Member constituencies, and as soon as they are divided the quota rules will apply.
Nevertheless, it would seem difficult to justify a provision which could berepresented as giving for an indefinite future period to these double-member constituencies in the provinces a privileged position in the sense that they willhave at least a chance of retaining the two Members, however great may be thefall in the number of electors. It would be represented by critics that for the sake of saving the position of the City of London the Government were creatingfor the double-Member constituencies in the provinces an anomalous position,that the Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended as an integral part of their scheme a limit of toleration for the double-Member constituencies other than the city and that there is no justification for rejecting their recommendation.5. The considerations of which the Boundary Commissioners will have totake account &quot; after local enquiry &quot; in the case of a double-Member constituencyin the provinces are of an entirely different character from any considerationsbearing on the question whether the City of London is to have two Members or one Member. It is appropriate to give to the Boundary Commissioners the function of considering whether Bolton, for example, with an electorate of 122,000shall remain a double-Member constituency or shall be divided into two single-Member constituencies; and, if it is divided, where the boundary between thetwo single-Member constituencies shall be drawn. As regards, however, the city of London, the question to be considered is not whether there is a special case for continuing the constituency as a single unit instead of dividing it into two parts, but whether there are special reasons why this constituency, where noquestion of splitting arises, shall, owing to its history and special position,continue to return two Members despite the fact that its electorate is numericallyinsufficient. This is not a question appropriate for determination by the boundary Commissioners.6. The City of London cannot be treated in the same way as other double-Member constituencies because under any general scheme of redistribution otherdouble-Member constituencies may be liable to have their boundaries altered,and it ought to be made clear in the statutory instructions to the BoundaryCommissioners that they have no discretion to alter the boundaries of theParliamentary constituency of the City of London or to throw the City or anyparts of the City into other constituencies.
