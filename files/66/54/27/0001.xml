THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 477.28th A tigust, 1944.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JULY 1944 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.GENERAL tje GAULLE visited Ottawa on the 11th July and left thefollowing day for Montreal and Quebec. He spoke at a public reception onParliament Hill, made a generally favourable impression and received anenthusiastic welcome.2. The sensation created by Senator Bouchard;s charge of subversive activities by French-Canadian extremists mentioned in the report for June hassomewhat quietened down, but in retrospect his exposure of the influence andaims of the Jacques Cartier Order, allegedly aiming at the establishment of anindependent State of Quebec, is seen to have marked a new stage in relationsbetween French and English-speaking Canadians. What previously had been confined to private discussions has now become a public issue. It is generallyconsidered that the violence of the reaction to the Senators charges on the partof the Quebec authorities (who promptly dismissed him from his post of chairman of the Quebec Hydro-Electric Commission), of the Roman catholic church and of almost the whole French-language press, is evidence which lendsmore support to the charges.3. The Minister of National Defence has declared the governments intention to retain the volunteer system of recruiting for the Armed Forces unless and until the numbers of volunteers fall short of requirements. He gave an assurance that there were enough general service troops in Canada to meet requirements for reinforcements up to the end of 1944. There was an increasein recruiting in June. Nevertheless, the Government are taking various stepsto induce men in the Home Defence Army to volunteer for overseas service, andare even appealing for recruits from men in the factories. At the same time,there is a surplus of recruits for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and it has been announced that recruiting has been suspended until the 1st October. In thisconnection it may be recalled that in April the Quebec Assembly passed by amajority of 55 votes to 4 a motion reaffirming the &quot; unyielding disapproval ofthis House to sending recruits overseas.&quot;4. An amending Bill to the Electoral Act designed to disfranchise allpersons of Japanese racial origin has aroused considerable controversy throughobjection in principle to racial discrimination. The Government have howpressed a revision making disfranchisement applicable only to those Japanesewho were previously barred from voting in British Columbia. In practice thismeans almost all those of Japanese descent in Canada.5.   The United Kingdom High Commissioner has reported that there are indications that a Federal General Election will take place in the not too distant[28100] copy No.
future. The term of the existing Parliament expires in April 1945, and this,in any case, fixes a limit beyond which the general election cannot be postponed.6. The Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Canadaattended for a short period at the Bretton Woods Conference. The CanadianDelegation was elected reporter for the main committee on the InternationalExchange Fund and has also provided a member for the Steering Committee.7. The sixth Victory Loan realised 81,407,547,650, some S200 million abovethe&apos;target.Service A activities.8. On the 3rd the Canadian M.T.B. 460 was sunk by mine in the Channel;there were six survivors. On the 5th H.M.C.S. Ottawa and Kootenay, in company with one of H.M. corvettes, probably sank a U-boat south of Beachy Head. early on the 6th the 12th Escort Group&quot; (H.M.C.S. Qu&apos;Appelle, Saskatchewan, Resti-gouche and Skeena) attacked four trawlers escorting outward-bound U-boats offBrest and sank three of them. On the night of the 8th/9th H.M.C. DestroyerHuron, in company with HAL Destroyer Tartar, engaged five trawlers W.NW.of St. Malo and scored several hits. Enemy shore batteries caused superficialdamage. On the night of the 14th/15th H.M.C.S. Haida, in company withHALS. Tartar and the Polish Destroyer Blyskawica, carried out a reconnaissance of the French coast, and when south of Brest sank one merchant ship and onetrawler and left another merchant ship sinking.9. On the 4th the Canadians launched a new attack west of Caen inconjunction with United Kingdom troops. The Canadians quickly capturedCarpiquet, but very severe fighting developed for the possession of an airfieldsouth of this village. The Germans subsequently launched several strong counter-attacks against Carpiquet village but all were stopped and several German tanks were destroyed. On the 8th, after a very powerful air bombardment. UnitedKingdom and Canadian troops launched a determined attack on Caen, whichwas captured by 5 p.m. on the following day. Our troops then rapidly moppedup the remaining Germans north and west of the Orne and the Canadianscompleted the capture of Carpiquet airfield. German reaction to our successwas very strong; nevertheless. United Kingdom troops succeeded in establishingthemselves firmly on the high ground north of Esquay, while the Canadians edgedtheir way forward into Louvigny, though they were compelled to withdraw fromthis village on the 11th.10. After the capture of Caen considerable reorganisation took place withinthe Second British Army, during which time all ground won was held and severalGerman counter-attacks repelled. On the 18th, after a very heavy air bombard-ment, armoured formations of the Second British Army launched an attack fromthe north between Caen and Touffreville. When this armoured thrust was wellunder way, the Canadians, in their turn, attacked across the Orne and capturedFaubourg de Vaucelles. the south-eastern suburb of Caen, following up thissuccess by securing Fleury and Cormelles the next day. Our armoured thrust,which had started so well, was finally halted by torrential rain which mademovement off roads impossible. During this pause imposed by the weather conditions United Kingdom and Canadian infantry, attacking south on either side of the Orne. succeeded in capturing Maltot and St. Martin by the 22nd:thus straightening out our line in this sector. Further west, however, a powerfulcounter-attack by German infantry and tanks on the night of the 21st/22ndresulted in the loss of the village of Esquay.11. On the 23rd the First Canadian Army under Lieutenant-General Crerarassumed command of the eastern sector of the Normandy bridgehead.12. On the 25th the advance south of Caen was renewed by an attack astride the Falaise road employing two Canadian divisions, the 2nd on the right, the3rd on the left. This attack met very severe resistance, but by noon Verriers andTilly la Campagne had been captured and the outskirts of May-sur-Orne hadbeen reached. Little further progress was possible although the Canadians clungfirmly to the ground they had won and stabilised their line in the area S.W. ofBourguebus.13. In the month of July 41 R.C.A.F. squadrons were operational overseas:25 in the United Kingdom, 14 in France, one in Italy and one in Ceylon.
Heavy bombers of No. 6 (R.C.A.F.) Bomber Group flew 2,592 sorties totalling12,347 operational hours, which was only slightly less than their total duringthe previous month. Forty-five bombers are missing from these operations. Themain targets were Flying Bomb bases, marshalling yards, factories, road and railway communications and tactical objectives in support of our armies inFrance.14. Canadian squadrons in Coastal Command flew 633 sorties totalling3,315 operational hours. One Wellington is the only aircraft missing from these operations. Four merchant vessels were claimed sunk, four set on fire and13 damaged; three escort vessels were sunk; one E-boat and one T.L.C. sunk.15. R.C.A.F. squadrons in 2nd Tactical Air Force flew a record numberof 8,909 operational sorties during July; 27 aircraft are missing from these operations.16. R.C.A.F. squadrons in the Air Defence of Great Britain flew 994 sortiestotalling 2,489 operational hours. Eight aircraft are missing from these operations.   Nineteen enemy aircraft and 44 Flying Bombs were destroyed.17. No. 417 Spitfire squadron located at Perugia airfield in Italy flew611 sorties and lost four aircraft.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.18. Mr. Curtin made a statement in the House of Representatives on the17th July on his mission abroad, including the discussions at the Prime Ministers&apos;Conference in London. His review covered the course and conduct of the warin the European and Pacific theatres, foreign policy and the discussions on hisown proposals for closer Commonwealth consultation. Referring to had discussions on the plans for the prosecution of the war against Japan, Mr. Curtinsaid that an important pointer to the progress of the operations was the factthat most of the formidable tasks imposed on General MacArthur by his directiveof April 1942 had been accomplished and he now confidently faced the most difficult phase, the offensive to defeat the enemy forces in the South-West Pacific.There had been general agreement in London on the lines of Australia&apos;s futureeffort in providing fighting forces, contributing to the maintenance of the allied forces in the Pacific and providing food for the United Kingdom. There was,Mr. Curtin said, a minimum fighting strength below which Australia would not go and a maximum beyond which her forces could not go, and the Governmentwas seeking to strike a balance between these limits.19. As regards improved machinery for consultation and co-operationwithin the Empire, Mr. Curtin said he did not seek to convert Mr. mackenzie king to his point of view, nor could he accept, from Australia&apos;s point of view,Mr. King&apos;s opinion that the present means of co-operation had worked with complete success. There were certain differences in the position of the variousDominions regarding defence and a pre-eminent characteristic of the BritishCommonwealth was its diversity within the framework of its unity. his proposals had been based on what Australia considered necessary in the lightof her war-time experience. By co-operation among themselves, the Britishpeoples could contribute to world security. Future co-operation was a matter ofbilaterial and multilateral planning and arrangements according to the strategic position of the Dominion concerned.20. For the first time since 1916, the Labour Party has a majority in the senate. As from the 1st July the four Labour Senators elected at the GeneralElection last year will begin their six years&apos; term succeeding four members ofthe Opposition.  The state of parties in the Senate is now Labour     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      22Opposition ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      1421. The Governor-General and Lady Gowrie have been entertained at manyfarewell parties given by Ministers and members of the Diplomatic Corps andthe major daily papers have all had editorials paying sincere tribute to the selflessdevotion of their Excellencies, especially praising the Governor-GeneraFspolitical wisdom and impartiality.22. M. Roger Monmayou has arrived in Canberra as the Representativeof the French Committee of National Liberation.[28106] b 2
23. The coal situation shows no sign of improvement. The Governmenthave made practical suggestions, such as the introduction of a second shift anda system of relief miners to fill the place of absentees, but they have been rejected by the miners&apos; representatives.Service A activities.24.   Two River class frigates were commissioned during the period.25. The strength of the Royal Australian Navy on the 8th July, excluding the Volunteer Defence Corps, was : men, 415,089; women, 27,003; total, 442,092.26. A total of 19,459 men had been released from the army to ruralindustry up to the 22nd July.27. The total strength of United States forces (Army and Air Corps) inthe South-West Pacific Ar ea on the 1st July, 1944, was 627,212, including133,607 of the Air Corps. The total strength includes 71,871 personnel who arenow in the South-West Pacific Area as the result of a transfer from the SouthPacific Area of a portion of the Solomon Islands group.NEW ZEALAND.28. Mr. Fraser has now returned to New Zealand from Europe and north america, and on his arrival at Auckland made a very full statement to the press.He subsequently made a report to the House of Representatives. He emphasised that a world organisation for peace was essential and that, while there was room for regional organisations, wrorld security could not be organised on a regionalbasis. He expressed satisfaction at the general conduct of British foreign policy,which had been a far-sighted embodiment of democratic principles and policies.He also praised united Kingdom Colonial policy. He said that New Zealandwas well satisfied with the existing system of Commonwealth co-operation, but would be agreeable to any improvements which would make it better if these were possible. He also referred to civil aviation, and said that Australia and NewZealand preferred international ownership and operation, but, if this was not acceptable, they advocated the most complete international control with a jointUnited Kingdom/Canada/Australia and New Zealand service in the Pacific.29. The Empire Parliamentary Association Delegations from the UnitedKingdom and Canada have visited New Zealand. The Acting Prime Minister,before their arrival, announced that their main object was to investigate the war effort of New Zealand and that the time allotted to public functions and entertain-rnents would have to be restricted. The Delegations have exoressed themselves as delighted with the warmth of the welcome they have received and impressed by what they have seen of the New7 Zealand war effort. They have found every-where sympathy with the people of Great Britain over the flying bomb attacks,but they do not think that the New Zealand people generally sufficientlyappreciate the extent of damage to life and property.30. The national caucus of the Labour Party has discussed the negotiations in London by Mr. Nash and Mr. Fraser on export and import prices. There havebeen signs of anxiety among the farmers as to the result of these negotiations,and it seems probable that the Government will have great difficulty with the farmers unless they are prepared to give them the benefit of increased prices.31. There has been considerable criticism of the decision of the Coal-MinesCouncil which has been accepted by the Government to increase the wages of theminers.32. The Leader of the Opposition has made a public attack on the allegedextravagant expenditure on furniture and equipment for the Minister and staffof the New Zealand Legation in Moscow7. The Acting Prime Minister has replied to this attack, but various papers have supported Mr. Holland on the grounds thatthe Legation is unnecessary and that, even if it is necessary, the expenditure isgrossly extravagant.Service A activities.33. H.M.N.Z.S. Kiwi, Breeze and Gale have been operating in the SolomonIslands area under the orders of Commander, South Pacific Area. H.M.N.Z.S.Matai and Tui have been refitting at Auckland.
34. The 80th and 81st Motor Launch Flotillas, comprising 12 fair miles,have also been operating in the Solomon Islands area, under orders of Commander,South Pacific Area.35.   H.M.N.Z.S. A rbutus has left the United Kingdom for New Zealand.36. Three New Zealand Army officers have arrived in the United Kingdomand are attending the present Staff College course. These officers all haveexperience in operations in the Pacific.37. Three New Zealand officers are now undergoing 16 weeks&apos; course inoperational research in Australia, to be followed by an attachment of two months to the Operational Research Section for work in the forward areas. Two NewZealand Army officers have arrived in the United Kingdom to join the Ministryof Supply to assist in research and development of army Signal equipment.38. About 6,000 ranks of the 3rd Division have now returned to NewZealand.39. A comb-out of the personnel on Royal New Zealand Air Force Stationswithin New Zealand is at present being undertaken in an effort to release man-power for other purposes and to ensure that the full use of man-power is beingeconomically employed in the Royal New Zealand Air Force.40. Since there are large surpluses of trained pilots, the New Zealand quota of pilots to Canada has been entirely suspended for three months and thereafter the quota will be reduced to 60 per cent, of the previous total.41. The 2nd New Zealand Division reappeared in the battle in Italy duringthe third week of the month when they took over from the French on the extremeleft of the 13th Corps in touch with troops of the United States Fifth Army ontheir left flank. On the 24th the New Zealanders were reported as fighting their way forward against strong opposition to the high ground overlooking Florencefrom the S.W. and making good progress.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.42. Supporters of the Government are greatly relieved to have the PrimeMinister back in the country, but he has been warned on all sides that he hasreturned to a political situation where criticism is noticeably accentuated. Sincethe close of the Parliamentary session, there has been a rapid and significantgrowth in the expressions of discontent. The new meat scheme, wdiich seeks to control prices, has caused much resentment in farming areas and has led to themost serious shortage of the war in the larger towns. There is also a severeshortage of dairy products and of many household commodities. Furthermore,demobilised soldiers and others are finding it almost impossible to obtain housing accommodation and prices are still rising. In these circumstances, there hasbeen a decline in the confidence felt in the United Party, while the nationalist party, on the other hand, is showing a definite increase in activity. It is confident that the tide has now turned in its favour and it is now making preparations forthe 1948 elections, which it believes will return it to power. The Party&apos;s line is tomake the most of present and possible post-war discontents and to exploit thecrudest forms of racial prejudice, including anti-semitism. It is making a deter-mined attempt to gain a foothold in the Rand, mainly by using the technique ofinfiltration into the Trades Unions.43. Mr. F. H. Mentz. Member of Parliament for West Dene, and Secretaryof the Nationalist Party of the Rand, was kidnapped from his home in Johannes-burg and brutally assaulted by a band of six men on the 22nd July. Dr. Malan,the leader of the Nationalist Party, in a statement following the assault, claimed that the Ossewa Brandwag could not be dissociated from the assault and hasappealed to all Afrikaners to resign from that organisation. In reply, Dr. VanRensburg says that Dr. Malan has merely seized an excuse to sabotage collabora-tion between the two parties. Apparently the origins of the assault lie in aquarrel between the two parties which arose in the following way. the nationalists had inaugurated a Party Republican Propaganda Fund and hadcollected some  20,000 in Cape Province and were then hoping to collect a further 80,000 from the Transvaal and the Free State. Subsequently, the ossewa brandwag inaugurated a similar relief fund which proved to be rather more
popular than that of the Nationalist Party. Mr. Mentz was a strong opponentof the Ossewa Brandwag&apos;s Fund and made a number of public attacks upon it.Two arrests were made, and, in spite of Dr. Van Rensburg&apos;s denials, PredicantStander, the Chairman of the Ossewa Brandwag, virtually admitted his party&apos;responsibility in a resolution submitted to the Dutch Reformed Church Synodappealing to Afrikaner groups to refrain from actions which provoked suchassaults. The incident is important in that it has again destroyed the efforts which were successful in the Wakkerstroom Election to bring about co-operationbetween the Nationalist Party and the Ossewa Brandwag.44. European agitation in Natal against the compromise agreement on theIndian occupation of property is increasing. The chief argument against the compromise is that it in no way restricts the purchase by Indians of property in european areas; that the process of purchase is being accelerated; and that intime, with the increase of the Indian population of Natal, it will be impossibleto continue any restrictions on the occupation of property in Indian possession.An official of the Durban City Council has made a statement to the presssuggesting that a possible solution of the problem of Indian penetration wouldbe a division of the city and its hinterland into regions in which the european and Indian sections respectively would have full scope for development. the division would be on voluntary lines, but would be encouraged by the provisionof proper amenities. The Nationalists are so encouraged by the recent trend ofevents in Natal that they are preparing with great fanfare to hold a ProvincialCongress in Natal, at which Dr. Malan will speak.Service Activities.45. On the 2nd the 6th South African Armoured Division, continuing their advance northward, occupied Sinalunga without contact, but as soon as the areaS.W. of Arezzo was reached some of the bitterest fighting since the fall of rome developed owing to the Germans presenting violent resistance to any furthernorthward movement. Nevertheless, on account of the steady pressure maintained by our troops, the Germans were obliged to continue to fall back slowly along the whole front, with the result that Arezzo Avas captured on the 16th and Anconaand Leghorn two days later. The South Africans, sharing in this generaladvance, pressed forward in the direction of Radda, which also fell on the 18th.Continuing their advance, the South African Armoured Division reached Greveon the 24th and carried their forward movement a few miles beyond the town.Hereafter, German resistance gradually stiffened as the outer defences of Florencewere reached, but, in spite of continued opposition, the South Africans succeeded in capturing Casciano on the 27th.EIRE.46. Mr. Dillon, Independent, speaking in the Dail on the 28th June,commented upon the Eire Governments reply to the United States recent request for the removal from Eire of German and Japanese representatives. He comparedthe attitude that would have been adopted by the Axis Powers in similar circumstances with the attitude of the British Commonwealth of Nations and theUnited States. He wanted to know what Mr. cle Valera&apos;s policy was with regardto the Commonwealth, because it wras fundamental to the whole question of post-war planning. Mr. Dillon told the Dail that he was in favour of Eire retainingmembership of the Commonwealth and using it for three ends : (a) to secure the unity of the Irish Nation and the abolition of the Border, (b) in order to make theinfluence of a predominantly Catholic nation effective in the councils of thenations of the world, and (c) in order to ensure for the people of Eire anopportunity of securing employment on equal terms throughout the territories ofthe Commonwealth of Nations, to which Eire at present belonged. Fie went on toask whether, if the influence of Eire within the Commonwealth was so vast, it was unreasonable to anticipate that in the post-war world, if the people of Eire werecordial participants in its activities, their influence would continue to be aCatholic influence, that the philosophy underlying the politics of the CatholicState would find effective expression not only within the limits of that Common-wealth, but, through it, on the world at large.47. Mr. Dillon said that he was convinced that unless a modus vivendi wasdiscovered for Eire&apos;s permanent membership of the Commonwealth, however that
Commonwealth might develop in the post-war period, there was no prospect of getting rid of the Border in their time. He wanted to get rid of the Border, notonly because that was the natural ambition of every Irish nationalist in Irelandand outside it, but because, if the Border continued, there would develop upon itsocial problems incomparably graver than any they had yet had to contend with.48. Replying, Mr. de Valera said that Mr. Dillon ought to know what thenature of their present relationships with the States of the British Common-wealth were. These were defined in two documents, namely, the Constitution,which gave certain powers in the executive domain, and the External relations act. There had been no suggestion by his Government that they proposed to change this in any way. Mr. de Valera did not propose to try to give any specialdefinition of the character of these relationships and he certainly did not thinkthat the present was the time to start discussing these matters when no advantagewhatever was to be gained. So far as their general attitude was concerned,they were quite prepared to play their part in any world organisation of states in which the sovereign character of those States was admitted and acknowledgedand association would be one of free will. They were prepared to play their part in preserving peace in the future and in trying to bring about better con-ditions for human beings in every country.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.49. The political stage recovered much of its old animation in July, with gandhi once more fully in the limelight. In a curious sequence of disclosuresto the press, both by the publication of correspondence between Rajagopalachari andJinnah and by statements to the press or conversations with individual corres-coorespondents, Gandhi became associated directly or indirectly with two sets of proposals, one a plan for settling relations between Hindus and Moslems underfuture constitutional developments, the other a scheme for the immediateestablishment of a National Government. As these proposals have been analysedand discussed at length in the debates in Parliament .on the 25th July (Lords)and 28th July (Commons), only a brief description of them need be given here.50. In the proposals for a communal settlement, which were propoundedto Jinnah by Rajagopalachari last April, with the alleged (and apparentlyauthentic) approval of Gandhi, the most noteworthy feature is Canclhi&apos;sconditional acceptance of the principle of Pakistan by the provision for a plebiscite after the war to determine the issue of separation in districts having an absolute Moslem majority. Conditions were attached which made acceptanceof the offer by Moslems as a whole very doubtful, and it was not surprising that Jinnah refused to commit himself without reference to the League. the hindu Mahasabha and the Sikhs protested loudly against the proposals.Moslem League papers were, on the whole, non-committal while welcoming the admission of the Pakistan principle. At the meeting of the Moslem league council, Jinnah announced that he had responded to a suggestion from Gandhifor a meeting and this would take place in Bombay in the middle of August.In his address he analysed the proposals in very critical terms. The league council gave him full powers to engage in the discussion.51. In the second set of proposals Gandhi made known his scheme for theimmediate establishment of a National Government responsible to the Legislaturecoupled with the immediate grant of independence to India, in return for which full co-operation in the war would be given by Congress. The Viceroy wasto be shorn of his reserved powers except that, during the war, he and theCommander-in-Chief would retain control of &quot;military operations&quot; the costof which would not be borne by India. These proposals closely resemble the line taken by Congress in the Cripps negotiations : they would involve fundamental changes in the Constitution, and, as was made clear in Parliament, are unaccept-able to His Majesty&apos;s Government even as a basis for discussion. They were first given to the press and were re-embodied in a letter sent by Gandhi to theViceroy towards the end of July. No reply had been sent to the letter before theend of the month.
52. It is too soon to appraise the effect of the publication of these proposals,in which the Viceroy believes that Gandhi&apos;s main objects are to secure the releaseof the Congress Working Committee and the transfer of real power to Congress.Foreign and Frontier Relations.53. Afghanistan. The War Minister returned to Kabul from the southern province where the situation continued quiet.54 North-West Frontier. The Afghan rebel, Mazarak, remained inhiding in the Madda Khel country, close to the Indo-Afghan border. He isbelieved to spend most of his time on the Afghan side, but to pay visits to MaddaKhel tribes on the British side of the border. The Waziristan authorities issued a warning to the British tribes by leaflet that if they harboured Mazarak theirvillages would be liable to air action.55.   The situation in Waziristan remained quiet.56. Tibet. The Tibetan Government maintained their unwillingness togrant visas for the additional seventeen persons whom the Chinese wish to send to Lhasa with Mr. Shen the new Chinese Representative with the TibetanGovernment to Lhasa. The latter was likely to arrive there at the end of themonth and stated in conversation with the Political Officer in Sikkim when hepassed through Gangtok that he had personal instructions from theGeneralissimo and hoped to bring about an agreed frontier between China andTibet with a large measure of autonomy for the latter country.57. Persian Gulf. Considerable interest was shown in events in Japan,and an even greater interest in the attempt on Hitler&apos;s life. The general beliefis that Germany is growing increasingly weak.58. An agreement has been brought about, largely through the efforts ofthe British Political Agent, for the restoration of friendly relations between theSheikhs of Bahrein and Qatar in connection with a place named Zubarah onthe Qatar peninsula opposite Bahrein. The embargo on trade and travel to Qatarwhich the Sheikh of Bahrein had imposed is now likely to be lifted to the generalconvenience.Finance.59. Gold Sales (previous reference December 1943). His Majesty&apos;sGovernment informed the&quot; Government of India that the imperative necessity ofconserving and increasing the external resources of the United Kingdom renders itimpossible for them to continue supplying gold for sale in India after Septembernext. The Government of India have acquiesced in this decision but there canbe no doubt that the withdrawal of this assistance will seriously weaken the anti-inflationary campaign in India. The question whether equivalent assistance could be obtained from America falls to be considered in the context of theChancellor of the Exchequer^ proposals regarding the United Kingdom balanceof payments.60. Monetary Conference. The strong Indian delegation which attended the Bretton Woods Conference pressed the desirability of making provision inany international arrangements for the liquidation of India&apos;s sterling balances.A similar proposition was advanced by the Egyptian delegation. The UnitedStates and United Kingdom delegations resisted on the ground that, whilst the monetary Fund would assist in providing a favourable economic backgroundfor the settlemepnt of financial claims arising out of the war, it would be over-burdened if, in addition, it were required to deal with such war-time legacies, andthe problem must, therefore, be settled between the countries directly concerned.The Conference as a whole accepted this view. It remains to be seen whetherIndian public opinion, which attaches overwhelming importance to the point,wall, as a result of this and of the inferior position relative to China which hasbeen accorded to India in the scale of quotas, be prepared to support theGovernment of India in a policy of co-operation in the Fund.Economic.61. Reciprocal Aid. Arrangements for the supply of raw materials to theUnited States from India under Reciprocal Aid were completed during the early part of July. The Government of India have agreed that, as from the1st April, 1944, raw materials (which phrase includes burlap and foodstuffs)
required by the United States for direct war purposes should be made available under Reciprocal Aid. The United States will continue to obtain their require-ments through the channels used previously but under the new arrangement theywill be reimbursed in dollars through the India Supply Mission in washington in respect of such goods as are agreed to be eligible for Reciprocal Aid.62. Export Price Control Scheme for Cotton Textiles. One effect of theexisting world shortage of cotton textiles is that importing territories have tomake their purchases in the market indicated by the Combined Board atWashington and are no longer able to take advantage of competition betweenvarying markets. They have in consequence no option but to pay the pricesdemanded by their particular market. To meet this situation the Governmentof India have initiated an Export Price Control Scheme relating export prices to those laid clown in their order of last year controlling domestic prices. this order stipulates the percentage above the domestic standard price which anexporter may charge, the percentage varying in the case of (1) actualmanufacturers and (2) middle-men, allowance being made where necessary forselling agents&apos; commission. This scheme will be most welcome in Middle Eastand African colonial territories where the high price of such an essentialcommodity as cotton textiles has placed a severe strain on their domestic economy.It should also make a substantial contribution to efforts in these areas to reducethe costs of the raw materials produced by them.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.63.   Royal Indian Navy.Nothing to report.Military.64. Italy. Indian troops continued to play a prominent part in the advanceof the 8th Army in the Central Sector.65. North-West Frontier. Action taken against the Eaqir of Ipi and his followers discouraged general tribal support and by the middle of the monthhostiles were beginning to disperse.   The situation was otherwise quiet.66. Burma. Throughout the month a relentless pursuit of the retiringenemy Avas maintained over difficult terrain and in spite of bad weather conditions. By the month&apos;s end their expulsion from Manipur State, which theyinvaded in March, was in sight. Large numbers of Japanese had been cut offEast and North-East of Ukhrul and were steadily annihilated. The enemy had also been completely cleared from the Imphal plain and were being steadilypushed southwards along the Tiddim road, down the track leading from Ukhrulto the Chindwin River, and down the Palel-Tainu road to the south-east ofImphal. Large quantities,of ammunition were abandoned by the Japanese andmany guns and some tanks were captured. A significant fact also was thatincreasing numbers of prisoners were taken.67. In North Burma, General StilwelFs Chinese, American and Chinditforces continued to make steady progress in the reduction of the garrison inMyitkyina, while the enemy driven from Mogaung withdrew south-west down the railway towards Katha.68. Air. Eastern Air Command flew an average of 2,500-3,000 sortiesweekly throughout the month. In spite of adverse weather conditions transport aircraft flew 4,882 sorties, carrying 7,305 men, 11,500 tons, and evacuating2.794 casualties. Supply dropping to troops in the forward areas continuedunabated in spite of very difficult conditions. The effort of the Strategic AirForce decreased somewhat owing to the switching of medium R.A.F. and heavyAmerican bombers to transport duties and also owing to bad weather. an indication of our air superiority is that Spitfires took over the role of short-range ground attack aircraft.69. Enemy air effort was on a very small scale. The numbers of theirlight bombers and twin-engined fighters in Burma appeared to have decreased,but single-engined fighters seem to have been maintained&quot; in strength throughputthis monsoon.[28106]c
General.70. Morale The news from all theatres of war encouraged hopes of an earlier end to the war than was previously expected and gave newr impetus tofighting spirit. The Japanese retreat in Manipur had an extremely good effect,particularly on Indian troops. Repatriation of British troops was clarified by recent orders, but the reason for the shorter period served by pesonnel of theR.A.F. to qualify for repatriation was not understood and deeply resented.71. The main anxiety of Indian troops continued to be the welfare oftheir families and connected subjects such as leave.72. Health. The hot weather had the effect of causing an increase in the sick rate among officers and B.O.Rs. Among Indian troops the sick rate remainedsatisfactory.73. Bombay reconstruction. This continued to progress satisfactorily. Bythe middle of the month the clearance of debris was 100 per cent, complete inPrince&apos;s Dock and 95 per cent, complete in Victoria Dock.74. Works. The general progress continued to be reasonably satisfactory.The Assam access road, which is virtually completed, carried traffic successfullythroughout its length during the first heavy rains.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Occupied- Burma.75. Dr. Ba Maw has sent a message to General Koiso on the formation ofthe new Japanese Government, assuring him of ,Burma&apos;s confidence in hisleadership, and also one of congratulation to Hitler on his recent escape.76. . According to the latest information, the Burma National Army consists of nine battalions, one of which is a heavy A.A. battalion and another Sappersand Miners.77. Reports indicate that, though the return of the British would probablybe welcomed in North Burma, little active co-operation can be expected fromvillagers there so long as there is any possibility of Japanese reprisals.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Shortage of Crawler Tractors.78. It is feared that agricultural production in the Colonies is likely to behandicapped to some extent during the coming year owing to the virtualimpossibility of obtaining crawler tractors in the quantity required. Crawlertractors for the Colonies can only be obtained from the United States and theamounts which can be released for civilian purposes are nowhere near equal tothe demand. Colonial requirements for the year 1944 are 282, and up to dateonly 18 (and these of the smallest type) have been released. The British ColoniesSupply Mission in Washington are trying to obtain good second-hand equipment,but even this is not easy to obtain and used equipment of this type requires very careful inspection indeed before purchase. The shortage of crawlers is a matterof some importance, since it is likely to handicap such important campaigns asthat for increased sugar production in several of the Colonies.Defence.79. A member of the Colonial Office has been included in the UnitedKingdom Delegation on World  Organisation talks in Washington in case
questions have to be discussed with the Americans which may affect british colonies.80. It was announced from S.E.A.C. Headquarters on the 4th July thatWest African troops were operating- with the late General Wingate&apos;s Chinditcolumns. The West Africans continued to form part of the Chindit Forces when these were placed under the command of General Stilwell and good reports ofthem have been recently received from S.E.A.C.81. On the 27th June the High Commissioner, Western Pacific, informed me that the Officer Commanding United States Troops in the Ellice Islands hadbeen ordered to withdraw all troops from Nukufetau Atoll except for twelve men.The Officer Commanding Troops said, in the course of casual conversation, thatthese men were being left at the request of the State Department. This Atoll inthe Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony is one of several which the United StatesGovernment claimed as belonging to&apos; them in an American aide-memoire of the16th August, 1939. The British title, however, has been held by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be indisputable. I have asked the High Commissioner if he canascertain anything more about the purpose of the retention of the United Statesparty in the&apos; Atoll, and particularly whether the troops may be a skeleton partyfor a reserve staging-point in United States trans-Pacific communications until more northerly routes are established.82. Opportunity was taken of the Cairo Conference on man-power to holddiscussions between&quot; Colonial Government Representatives and the ArmyEducation Camps staff on the pre-vocational training to be given to Colonialtroops in preparation for their eventual demobilisation.83. Particular importance is attached to training of these men. since fromthe general broadening of their experience by overseas service and by the standingthey will have acquired as a result of Army service they are likely to have specialinfluence among their own people on their return.84. The attention of all Colonial Governments has been drawn to the needfor making provision for the welfare of Colonial persons who have been blindedby war service of any kind, and for their treatment on modern lines. With theassistance of St. Dunstan&apos;s and the National Institute for the Blind, a memo-randum has been prepared which gives suggestions for the organisation of anInstitute for the Blind, which might well be organised on a regional basis toprovide facilities for blinded persons from adjacent Colonies where differences oflanguage and customs do not stand in the way. Such institutes would, of course,be capable of development to serve long-term civilian needs. An estimate has beengiven of the staff, blind and other, which would be required for such an institutionand St. Dunstan&apos;s have offered to assist Colonial Governments in the supply or training of blind staff. Suggestions have also been given for the training andemployment of blind persons having special regard to the less industrialised andmechanised economy of Colonial territories.85. Colonial Governments have been informed of the proceedings of theEmergency Legislation Committee of the War Cabinet, and have been reouested toexamine and classify their local War Legislation with a view to its progressiverepeal as conditions permit. All Colonies propose to retain at least their economic controls until the end of the transitional period between war and peace (Stage D).The legislative basis for such powers will be further considered.Civil Aviation.Bermuda.86. The Governor of Bermuda, who has recently visited this country,brought with him the Chairman and one of the members of the Bermuda AirportBoard. The opportunity was taken to arrange for them to see something of themethods of airport control and organisation in this country, and to discuss withthem various civil aviation questions affecting Bermuda.British West Indian Airways.87. Two of the Directors of British West Indian Airways have also visited the United Kingdom for discussions with the Colonial Office and the Air ministry on the subject of the purchase of the Hudson aircraft which have been obtained for the Company&apos;s use, and also the expansion of the Company&apos;s air services to[28106] &apos; d
ensure the most economical use of the aircraft now at the disposal of the Company,and to provide improved air communications between the various British colonies in the Caribbean Area.West A frica.88. Lord Swinton. the Resident Minister, West Africa, arrived in thiscountry on the 23rd July for consultations with Ministers and the Colonial Office.His discussions at the Colonial Office have been concerned with post-war develop-ment plans for West Africa and kindred subjects. It is expected that LordSwinton will take a short period of leave before returning to West Africa aboutthe middle of September. Lord Swinton was accompanied by Mr. Noel Hall, theDevelopment Adviser for West Africa, who also took part in the discussionsreferred to above.89. Cost-of-living difficulties among European officials have given rise toa lot of dissatisfaction in recent months in the three largest West african colonies. These difficulties formed the subject of enquiry by Sir C. Jeffries,who has recently visited West Africa for the purpose of discussing european and African service problems with the Resident Minister and the four Governors.As a result, agreement has been obtained to proposals for revising the basisof the existing scheme of separation allowances, and for introducing local cost-of-living allowances.Far East negotiations with regard to the future of Borneo.90. Discussions have now been opened between the Colonial Office and theBritish North Borneo (Chartered) Company, as to the terms upon which theadministrative control of the State of North Borneo shall be transferred fromthe Company to His Majesty&apos;s Government.91. A statement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposals as regardsSarawak has.been transmitted to the Rajah, and it is hoped that discussions withhis representatives will begin in the near future.West Indies.92. Sir Frank Stockdale, the Comptroller for Development and Welfare,and Mr. Wakefield, Inspector-General of Agriculture in the West Indies, areat present in this country for discussions.United States Bases Legislation.93. Draft bills (based upon a model) to implement the United Kingdom-United States Bases Agreement have now been prepared in the Bases Colonies.Not all of them have been received here, but it has become apparent that eachColony probably has many suggestions to offer which may be important to otherBases Colonies as affecting their bills. It has been decided that the best andmost expeditious way of dealing with the situation is to hold a conference inthe West Indies, of Law Officers from Bases Colonies, where views would be exchanged and, as far as possible, all outstanding points settled. arrangements have, therefore, been made for such a conference to be held in Trinidad com-mencing on the 7th August, which will be presided over by Mr. K. O. RobertsWray, my Assistant Legal Adviser, who has been closely connected with thenegotiations in connection with the Bases Agreement and the preparation oflegislation to give it effect. It is hoped that the conference will be able toprepare final bills for immediate introduction into the local legislatures.Recruitment of West Indian labour for the United States.94. Arrangements have been concluded for the recruitment of about20,000 workers from certain of the Colonies in the Caribbean, for employmentin the United States under the War Man-power Commission. A number ofthese workers have already arrived in the United States, the remainder areawaiting shipping.Report of Individual Colonies.Palestine.95. There has been no change in the general attitude of either the Arabor Jewish communities to military developments; they take the defeat of germany for granted, and are increasingly preoccupied with internal affairs.
96. The Arab scene is dominated by propaganda and activities on behalfof Ahmed Hilmi Pasha&apos;s National Fund for raising money to conserve Arabland. Otherwise, the Arab leaders seem as far from unity as ever, and personaljealousies predominate.97. Arab opinion awaits with interest the forthcoming Arab UnityConference, to be held in Egypt. Unfavourable comment was passed uponMr. Greenwood&apos;s article, published in Jewish Labour, in support of Zionistaims, and also on the commutation of the death sentence on a gangster of theStern group. The latter is stigmatised as weakness towards Jewish militarismand leniency not shown to Arabs in 1936-39. The American Republican pro-Jewish platform evoked practically no Arab press comment, but it has causedresentment among the townspeople.98. Jewish activities have been concerned with inter-party manoeuvresconnected with the impending elections for the Jewish Elected Assembly andthe Ffistadruth. Faction leaders are indulging in plain speaking against theformer direction of the affairs of the Yishuv.99. Refugee rescue schemes, focussed especially on Hungary, have been thechief preoccupation of the Jewish Agency leaders during July. The Jewishpress and politicians alike continue to call for unrestricted immigration. the lack of progress in Arab unity talks is a source of satisfaction to the Jews.100. There was a further recrudescence of terrorist activity on the 14th July,when the District Police Headquarters and the District Land Registry office atJerusalem wrere attacked and severely damaged by explosives and fire. Manysuspects were brought in for interrogation and a number are being detained underthe Emergency Regulations. Responsibility was boastfully claimed in apamphlet issued by the Irgun Zvi Leumi, their alleged object being to secure freeimmigration under the direction of the Jewish authorities. The Hebrew Presswas unanimous in the condemnation of what the Palestine Post characterised as&quot;criminal folly,&quot; but there was the usual tendency to make excuses for theperpetrators by hinting that they are crazed &quot; by the suffering of their people &quot;and by the indifference of the Government to those sufferings.101. Public security generally, apart from the incident above, gave no special cause for concern, but there was a continued increase of armed banditryin rural areas and of thefts in towns.102. The cost-of-living index of June was 238 (4 points above the Mayfigure, but 10 points below June last year). The food position is slightly easier,largely owing to the abundance of potatoes and temporarily increased suppliesof meat.Gibraltar.103. A further contingent of-Gibraltar evacuees, numbering about 3,100persons, left the United Kingdom on repatriation to Gibraltar.104. The preliminary arrangements for this contingent revealed that there patriation of the remaining evacuees would be much facilitated if they couldbe transferred beforehand from the London area. Such a transfer was also intheir own interests on account of the flying-bomb attacks, and the Government ofNorthern Ireland agreed, on being approached, to provide for them. Nearly all were accordingly removed to Northern Ireland in the course of the month.Malta.105. Lord Gort paid a visit to England at the request of the Secretary ofState during the month, and on the 20th July it was announced that his appoint-ment as High Commissioner for Palestine had been approved.Northern Rhodesia.106. With reference to the report for April, the conciliation proceedings in connection with the revision of the agreement between the copper miningcompanies and the Northern Rhodesia Mine Workers&apos; Union were resumed onthe 26th June and completed in twenty-four hours, all parties reaching agreement,Subsequently, however, the representatives of the artisans, consisting of about one-fifth of the European employees, decided not to sign the agreement and theartisans went on strike at one mine on the 3rd July and at two others on the 4th.These mines were compelled to close down.   There was no strike at Nkana and
production continued there. The artisans returned to work on the 6th at one mineand the 7th at two others after the managements had agreed to discuss their basicwage with the artisans. These discussions produced no agreement, but a strikeballot by the artisans failed to obtain a two-thirds&apos; majority for a strike. Thequestion of the artisans&apos; basic wage has now been referred to arbitration.Fiji and the Western Pacific.107. The Governor of Fiji has. with my approval, accepted a personalinvitation from Admiral Nimitz to visit him at Pearl Harbour.Trinidad.Franchise Committee.108. Since some opposition to the principle of universal adult suffrage maybe anticipated in the local Legislative Council. I have asked the Governor that thispoint may be separately debated there on a special resolution before the legislativesteps necessarv to give effect to these decisions are put in hand.109. The Report has been laid in the Library of the House of Commons andI have made a statement in the House on the subject.Bahamas.110. The Governor sent down to the House of Assembly a Bill to carry outthe recommendation of the 1942 Commission on the Riots that the secret ballotshould be extended throughout the Colony instead of, as at present, being confined to the island of New Providence in which the capital is situated. On my authority the Governor stated, in sending down this Bill, that it .was the express desire ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government that this measure should be passed.111. The House of Assembly has rejected the Bill, but the LegislativeCouncil, which is the Upper Chamber, is reported to have passed a resolutionunanimously condemning the action of the Lower House, and the press reportsthat they may be submitting a petition that this measure be passed over the headsof the elected Lower House. This could only be done by an Act of the imperial parliament.   I am awaiting a communication from the Governor on the subject.
