E.Foreign Office, 31st August, 1944.ANNEX I.REPORT BY THE EUROPEAN ADVISORY COMMISSION TO THEGOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE UNITEDSTATES OF AMERICA AND THE UNION OF SOVIET socialist republics.IN virtue of the Terms of Reference of the European Advisory Commission,agreed upon at the Moscow Conference, the Commission has given attentionto the terms of surrender to be imposed on Germany and submits herewith, for theconsideration of the three Governments, a draft Instrument entitled &quot; Uncon-ditional Surrender of Germany.&quot;We have individually reported to our respective Governments on the courseof the discussions which have resulted in:the settlement of the terms of the draftInstrument. It is unnecessary for us, therefore, to rehearse the history of those discussions. It should be sufficient for us; to say that the draft is designed as apredominantly military Instrument, consisting essentially of three parts. Thefirst is the Preamble, which includes unqualified acknowledgment on the part of12500   [28132] b
Germany of the complete defeat of the German armed forces on land, at sea andin the air. The second part is a short series of military Articles, which providefor the cessation of hostilities by all German armed forces, and which will enablethe Allied Representatives to carry out the more immediate measures of disarma-ment in Germany. The third part is a general Article setting forth the supreme authority of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Union of soviet Socialist Republics, with respect to Germany, - including the powercompletely to disarm and to demilitarise Germany, and to take such other steps asthe three Governments may deem requisite for future peace and security. TheArticle further states that the Allied Representatives will present additionalpolitical, administrative, economic, financial, military and other requirementsarising from the surrender of Germany, which the German authorities bind them-selves to carry out unconditionally. The Commission will submit in due course,for the consideration of the three Governments, drafts of basic Proclamations,Orders, Ordinances or Instructions laying down additional requirements as provided in the general Article.There are three matters in the draft upon which the Commission makessupplementary observations and recommendations.I.The Preamble states that the Allied Representatives, &quot; acting by authority oftheir respective Governments and in the interests of the United Nations, announce the following terms of surrender, with which Germany shall comply.&quot;The Commission has considered what action it should take or what procedureit should recommend in order to give effect to the statement that the allied representatives would be acting &quot; in the interests of the United Nations.&quot;In virtue of the discretion extended to it in its terms of reference, theCommission, has, as a first step, adch-essed a communication, a copy of which is annexed, to the Governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxemburg,Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Yugoslavia and to the French Committee ofNational Liberation, in view of their special interest in the terms of surrender for germany. After taking into account any views expressed in response to this communication, the Commission will consider further practicable steps lyingwithin its competence for consultation with these Governments and authorities,as well as with Governments of other United Nations.Note. The Representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on theEuropean Advisory Commission reserves his position in relation to th*-Polish Government in London.II.Article 2 (&amp;) of the draft Instrument states : &quot; The personnel of the formations and units of all the forces referred toin paragraph (a) above shall, at the discretion of the Commander-in-Chiefof the armed forces of the Allied State concerned, be declared to be prisonersof war, pending further decisions, and shall be subject to such conditions anddirections as may be prescribed by the respective Allied Representatives.&quot;The Commission recommends to the three Governments the following under-standing as regards Article 2 (b) :  &quot; Under Article 2 (b) of the draft Instrument of Surrender of Germany,there is no obligation on any of the three Allied Powers to declare all orany part of the personnel of the German armed forces prisoners of war : itis their right. Such a decision may or may not be taken, depending on the discretion of the respective Commanders-in-Chief. Prisoners of war sodeclared will be treated in accordance with the standards of internationallaw.&quot;III.Article 11 of the draft Instrument states : &apos;&quot; The Allied Representatives will station forces and civil agencies inany or all parts of Germany as they may determine.&quot;

Copy of Letter dated 25th July, 1944, from the Chairman of the european advisory Commission to the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Belgium,Czechoslovakia, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Nomvay, Poland and Yugoslavia,and to the Representatives in London of Greece and the French Committeeof National Liberation.(Secret.)Under instructions received from the Governments of the United States ofAmerica, the United Kingdom and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, theEuropean Advisory Commission has been entrusted with the task of making recommendations to the three Governments on the terms of surrender to be imposed upon Germany and the machinery required to ensure the fulfilment ofthose terms.The Commission has reached a point in its studies at which it would welcome an expression of the views of the European Allied Governments^ on any of thesematters which those Governments* would wish to convey to the Commission.I am therefore desired by the Commission to say that if theGovernment--should wish to lay before theFrench Committee of National LiberationCommission any statement of their views on any of the problems referred toabove or any exposition of their special interests in any of these matters, theCommission would be glad to receive such statements in writing so that it could take them into account in its further deliberations.I would emphasise that, since the work of the Commission in its presentphase has important military aspects, the proceedings of the Commission aresecret, and that it is essential that there should be no public disclosure either ofthe content of the communications which may be addressed to the commission by the Governments* concerned, or even of the fact that such communicationshave been made at all. The Commission therefore counts on the Governments^concerned to take the necessary security precautions to this end.ANNEX II.LETTER FROM UNITED KINGDOM REPRESENTATIVE  ON  THEEUROPEAN ADVISORY COMMISSION TO THE UNITED STATES.rS.!\.U    ouv1j11    ivuj. x n j. l v jjo.&apos;61st August, 1944.I HAVE the honour to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom have considered the draft Instrument of unconditional surrender of Germany agreed between the Delegations of the United Kingdom,the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and submitted bythe European Advisory Commission to the three Governments for approval onthe 25th July, 1944.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom approve the draftInstrument and assent to the understanding as regards Article 2 (b) recommended in Section II of the Report of the Commission.His Majesty&apos;s Government wish, however, to make their approval of thedraft Instrument subject to an understanding on. the following lines : (i) that the Instrument will still be open to reconsideration in the lightof any replies received from the European Allied Governments or authorities to the letter addressed to them by the Chairman of theCommission on the 25th July, 1944;(ii) that the text of the Instrument will, at the earliest convenient date, becommunicated to the Governments of the United Nations chiefly concerned, who will be invited to concur in its terms arid to authorisethe Representatives of the Supreme Commands of the three Powers to* Note.
