September 1944Copy No.WAR CABINET.SOVIET PRISONERS OF WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT their meeting on the 17th July the War Cabinet discussed the questionof the disposal of Soviet prisoners captured in France, and decided that theSoviet Government should be asked for their views. It was also decided (WarCabinet Conclusion 91 (44)) that if they replied asking for the repatriation of these men we should have to agree, but that we might suggest to the SovietGovernment that we should use them for agricultural labour for the time being.2. I attach as annexes to this paper the note communicated to the SovietEmbassy on the 20th July and the reply which was received from the SovietEmbassy on the 23rd August. It will be seen that the Soviet Government askfor the repatriation of the Soviet prisoners in the United Kingdom at the earliest opportunity and for transport to be provided by us for this purpose. They dcnot. however, mention the Soviet prisoners in the Middle East, who were also referred to in my note of the 20th July. The Soviet Government also state thatthe Soviet Military Mission have been instructed to get into touch through theWar Office with the Soviet prisoners here as was suggested in my note inagreement with the War Office.3. In the interval, the number of Soviet prisoners in the United kingdom has risen to 3,750, and an urgent decision is required on their disposal.4. In the meantime, also, a difficult position has arisen in the Middle East,where, under arrangements of some months&apos; standing, Soviet prisoners have beenscreened by a Soviet commission in Italy under Major-General Sudakov andthose selected by the Commission have been repatriated to the Soviet Union excepta few (less tnan I per cent.) who expressly stated that they did not&quot; wish to go.Those rejected by the Sudakov Commission have hitherto been retained as german prisoners in Egypt. The Soviet authorities in Cairo have now objected to thepractice adopted by the Middle East authorities of obtaining from each mana written declaration of his willingness to be repatriated, and have recentlyforbidden a newly arrived batch of prisoners to submit to an interview7 for thispurpose. Our Middle East authorities anticipate that the repatriation of the prisoners rejected by the Sudakov Commission will also shortly be demanded,adding that the distinction between &quot; selection&quot; and &quot; rejection&quot; by theCommission is obscure.5. In the meanwhile, the Secretary of State for War has informed me thatin view of the probability that if we do as the Soviet Government want and return all these prisoners to the Soviet Union, whether they are willing to returnto the Soviet Union or no, we shall be sending some of them to their death, hewould like a Cabinet ruling on the point. The Minister of Economic Warfarealso raised the point with the Prime Minister, who expressed the view that itwas dealt with rather summarily at the Cabinet of the 17th July and should bere considered after the Soviet Governments reply had been received. No real progress can be made towards clearing up the position here and in the middle east (where urgent instructions are now asked for) until this point is finally decided, and now that the Soviet reply lias been received I must ask for an urgent decision.6.   One argument advanced against sending these men back, has been that,if they were publicly tried and punished by the Soviet Government, the germans might take reprisals upon British and American prisoners in their hands.   Inpractice, however, I think and the Secretary of State for War agrees that the12501   [28137]SECRET.W.P. (44) 492.3rd September, 1944.
risk has already grown appreciably less. I do not anticipate that the germans will trouble about taking reprisals on British and American prisoners for any action which might be taken by the Soviet Government against their own nationals provided that such action is not accompanied by great publicity.I agree, however, that we must do our best to safeguard against any risk of suchreprisals, and I am prepared to ask the Soviet Government to give an undertakingnot to take action likely to lead to such reprisals until the risk has disappeared.7. As regards the humanitarian aspect of the matter, I l-ealise that manyof these men may have been compelled to join the German forces under greatduress and that it is possible that the Soviet Government may take harsh measures against some of them on their return. I have seen reports made both here andin the Middle East which appear to show that some of the men expect to be punished, and it has also been suggested that, if they felt that they had an entirelyfree choice, many would ask not to be repatriated. On the other hand, I have seenmany letters from prisoners here complaining that they have not been put in touchwith the Soviet authorities and asking that they should be sent back and given the chance of fighing in the Soviet forces against the Germans. Whatever may bethe truth of these reports, I recommend, after very careful consideration, that,provided we cover the reprisals point, we should agree to send back all Sovietprisoners of war, both here and in the Middle East. My reasons for this are thefollowing : (a) The pr/ma facie case against all the prisoners is that they were capturedwhile serving or having served in German military or para-militaryformations (the behaviour of which in France has often beenrevolting). A large proportion of the prisoners, for whatever reason,express willingness many anxiety to return to the Soviet Union.Of the remainder, I do not see that we have the means to judge as towhich served willingly with the Germans and which against their will.(b) A refusal to hand back to the Soviet Government their own nationals onthe ground that they might treat them too harshly would place us inan indefensible position. We have no legal or moral right to dictateto any Allied Government what steps they should or should not take in dealing with their own nationals who may have committed offencesunder their own law by serving with the German forces, and if any foreign Government were to adopt this attitude towards us we shouldtake the strongest exception.(c) If we agree to repatriate these prisoners we shall be treating the SovietGovernment in much the same way as we treat the other Allied Govern-ments whose nationals we have captured and to whom we return their nationals for employment, if so required, in their own forces. If were fused, the Soviet Government would accuse us of discriminatingbetween themselves and other Allied Governments. They would be highly suspicious of our motives.(d) We &quot;may have difficulty with the Soviet Government if we insist onretaining some of the prisoners selected for repatriation by theSudakov Commission on the grounds that they do not wish to returnto the Soviet Union.(e) If we refuse to hand back some of these prisoners both here and in theMiddle East, we may be saddled with them permanently, to our greatembarrassment.(/) Finally, we cannot separate this question from the problem of obtaining the speediest possible release of our own prisoners in Germany and poland who may be liberated by the Soviet advance. We shall haveto rely almost entirely on Soviet goodwill for ensuring that our ownmen are properly cared for and sent back as soon as possible, and ifwe make difficulty in returning to the Russians their own nationals itwill, almost certainly, react adversely upon their willingness to helpin restoring to us our own prisoners.8.   I therefore recommend-that the Cabinet should decide (1) to agree to the Soviet Governments request to repatriate their prisoners from the United Kingdom;(2) to instruct the Middle East authorities to send back all Russians whomthe Soviet authorities wish to have back irrespective of whether themen wish to return or not;Both these decisions would depend upon my obtaining from the. Soviet Government a satisfactory assurance that they would take no
action as regards bringing the men to trial and punishment during the continuation of hostilities with Germany.(3) to instruct the Middle East authorities to desist from the practice ofobtaining statements from Soviet prisoners of their willingness toreturn to the Soviet Union; and(4) to explain to the Soviet Government that shortage of shipping makes itimpossible for us to accede to their request that we should arrange for repatriation from the United Kingdom.As to this last point, I think that if the Soviet Government want these menthey should make their own arrangements to fetch them. While they are doing so we can employ as many as possible on useful work in this country, and the delaywhich will probably ensue before they are actually repatriated will probablyfurther diminish the risk of their taking any action wdiich might lead toreprisals by the Germans.A. E.Foreign Office, 3rd September, 1944.ANNEX 1.His Majesty&apos;s Governments Note of the 20th July, 1944.HIS Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents hiscompliments to his Excellency the Soviet Ambassador, and has the honour to drawhis attention to the following matter.2. During the Allied military operations in Normandy a number of Sovietcitizens have fallen into the hands of forces operating under the command of theSupreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Forces. These comprise Sovietcitizens who were found actually serving, or having recently served, in german military and para-military formations such as the Todt organisation, and also anumber who professed to have escaped or deserted from such formations. A largenumber of the men wrere, it is believed, formerly members of the forces of theSoviet Union. They have shown every desire to be hostile to Germany, and itappears that many of them joined these units or performed other work of amilitary or quasi-military character on behalf of the enemy owing to the harshconditions in which they had been detained as prisoners of war by the GermanGovernment. During evacuation from France some 1,114 of these Soviet citizenswere brought to the United Kingdom as prisoners of war and detained by theWar Office. About 470 were at first treat eel as civilian detainees. On a detailed investigation being made, it was found to be inappropriate to distinguish between these two classes, and the great majority of those who were being detained bythe Home Office have therefore been transferred to the custody of the War Office,by whom they are being detained as prisoners of war. There are also anumber of other Soviet nationals who have fallen into Allied hands in similar circumstances, who have been arriving for some time in the Middle East.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious as soon as possible to learn theviews of the Soviet Government as to disposal of these Soviet nationals, particu-iarly those who are now in the United Kingdom and any others who may hereafterbe brought here. While the matter is under consideration the men will beemployed on useful work in this country, particularly agricultural work.4. For military reasons and because of the lack of suitable accommodation,all prisoners of war brought to the United Kingdom from France are being-sent on as soou as possible to Canada or the United States. It was not possiblein the initial stages to distinguish to any great extent between the variousnationalities and categories of such prisoners while they were in transit throughthe United Kingdom, and it is understood that a few of the Soviet citizens above referred to have been included among the prisoners already sent on to Canadaor the United States.5. The Soviet Government will no doubt wish to ascertain in detail thecircumstances in which these Soviet nationals have come to serve in enemy military or para-military formations and the conditions under which they are at present being detained.6. For this purpose His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to make arrange-ments whereby the Soviet authorities in the United Kingdom may be put indirect contact with these Soviet nationals. It is suggested that the most convenient method of so doing would be for the Soviet military authorities inLondon to put themselves in contact with the War Office at a very early date to
arrange the necessary procedure and to discuss such matters relating to thetreatment and disposal of these prisoners as are of common interest to the twoGovernments.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to emphasise that, from the point ofview of the authorities in the United Kingdom, the matter is of urgency. Everyeffort will be made to avoid transferring overseas any more of the Soviet nationalsat present in the United Kingdom pending a reply from&apos; the Soviet Governmenton the points raised in this note. The Soviet Government will, however, under-stand the inconvenience of retaining large numbers of prisoners of war in thiscountry in transit camps. It would cause great difficulty, therefore, were adecision as to the disposal of these men to be much delayed.8. As the Soviet Government are aware, a similar problem has arisen in theMiddle East, where there are a number of Soviet nationals who have fallen intoAllied hands in Italy and elsewhere and who have been taken to Egypt asprisoners of war. The procedure that is being followed is that Major-GeneralSudakov has formed a commission for the purpose of segregating Soviet nationalswho are acceptable for further service with the Soviet forces from the Sovietnationals who are not so acceptable. The former class are being repatriated to theSoviet Union via the Middle East. The latter class are held by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as German prisoners of war. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose tocontinue this procedure unless the Soviet Government express any views to thecontrary.Foreign Office, 20th July. 1944.ANNEX 2.Soviet Xote of the 23rd August, 1944.(Translation.)THE Soviet Embassy present their compliments to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, and, with reference to his note ofthe 20th July, have the honour to state :  (1) The Secretary of Staters note above referred to indicates that the Britishtroops operating in Normandy have captured a certain number of soviet citizens, who are being held in the United Kingdom as prisonersof war, and that a few Soviet nationals, brought over to the UnitedKingdom from Northern France, have been sent to Canada or UnitedStates. LTntil the problem of these Soviet nationals has been settled with the Soviet Government, the British Government propose to employ them on useful work. The note adds that, sis they are anxiousto keep as few men as possible in the transit camps, the BritishGovernment would like the Soviet representatives to get into touchwith the British War Office with a view to discussing questions affecting the treatment of the prisoners of war, their accommodation,transfer and repatriation to the Soviet Union.(2) The Soviet Government consider that the Soviet nationals in question,most of whom have been forcibly deported to Germany by the Germanaggressors, should be sent to the Soviet Union at the earliest opportunity.(3) The Soviet Military Mission in the United Kingdom has been instructedto-get into touch with the British War Office and with the Sovietnationals, with a view to arriving at a complete understanding onall points connected with the maintenance of Soviet nationals in theUnited Kingdom and their repatriation to the Soviet Union.In this connexion the Soviet Embassy would be grateful if theBritish War Office would supply the Soviet Military Mission with alist of the Soviet nationals who are in British P.O.W. camps, state the location of these camps and also grant permission to visit the camps.(4) The Soviet Government would be obliged if the British Government wouldsupply the necessary transport for repatriating the Soviet nationalsirom the United Kingdom to the Soviet Union and also for assistancein repatriating to the U.S.S.R. those Soviet citizens who have alreadybeen sent to Canada or the United States.23rd August, 1944.
