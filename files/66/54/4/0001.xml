THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HtS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   A ugust 1944.&quot;SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 454.22nd August, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE OIL AGREEMENT.Report by the Lord Privy Seal, Chairman of the Ministerial Oil delegation to Washington.THIS is a cartel, almost world-wide in its scope, and regulating the produc-tion, distribution and retail prices of petroleum and its derivatives. Therewill be a danger that it will operate to raise or, at least maintain, price levels,bearing heavily upon the consuming public. This aspect must be carefully watched.The cartel has the support of all the oil companies on both sides of the atlantic, including Anglo-Iranian, Iraq Petroleum Company and Royal-Butch-Shell.The agreement frees American oil companies for the first time from lawsprohibiting combination for the regulation of markets.The American companies will be protected against the threat of competition from low-price producers abroad.It appears reasonable to assume that, after the war, there will be a contrac-tion in the demand for oil. Curtailment of production for the internationalmarket is therefore likely.But there will not be under the cartel any parallel curtailment of productionin the United States.This production is outside the control of the cartel and may not be curtailedby the Commission.It is not certain that American producers can be prohibited under their constitution from sending surplus American oil abroad.In any case, American production surplus to American consumption willinsist on a jjro rata place in world markets equivalent to pre-war Americanexports.In these circumstances, there is an urgent need to ensure that Britain is represented on the International Commission by strong men, independent of the oil companies and determined (1) to stand against any regulation of prices on the basis of high-costproducers and to the detriment of the consumer the world over;(2) to insist on the application of any restriction in production to theAmerican domestic supply as well as to other sources of supply;(3) to press strongly on the Commission the exchange difficulties of Britainwhen these arise.Only if there is a representation of this vigilant and resolute character can we hope to escape the dangers inherent in this international oil cartel.There is, at any rate, one real advantage in the agreement. It removes theMiddle East oil resources from the realm of international controversy, where theymight have been a cause of friction and possibly of bad relations with the UnitedStates.B.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W. 1,22nd August, 1944.[28039]
