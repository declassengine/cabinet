THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA,IESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,   August 1944.SECRET. Copy NoW.P. (44) 474.26th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.PARTICIPATION  OF FRANCE  IN THE  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THEEUROPEAN ADVISORY COMMISSION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN a letter dated the 25th July the Chairman of the European advisory commission invited the European Allied Governments and the French Committeeof National Liberation to communicate to &quot;the Commission in writing- any statement of their views which they might wish to convey to the Commissionon the question of the terms of surrender to be imposed on Germany and themachinery to ensure the fulfilment of those terms.2. The French Committee of National Liberation have sent a reply to theChairman of the Commission, in which they say, in substance, that in view ofthe capital importance of the German surrender for France, France could not regard herself as being bound by clauses in the elaboration of which she had taken no part; that the Commission was merely asked for French observations in writingwithout giving any opportunity for a French Representative to learn the views ofthe three Governments or to defend his own proposals by word of mouth; and that therefore the French authorities request that the members of the Commission willtake steps to allow a French Representative to discuss German problems withthem in conditions befitting the wide range of the French interests involved.3. By its terms of reference the Commission has discretion to inviterepresentatives of the Governments of other United Nations to take part inmeetings of the Commission when matters especially affecting their interests are under discussion.4. In view of the special position of France as regards German affairs,I propose to instruct the United Kingdom Representative on the Commission tosupport the request of the French Committee of National Liberation that a french representative should attend meetings of the Commission when German affairsare being discussed.5. I understand from M. Massigli that as soon as a French Governmentis established in Paris he will approach the United Kingdom, United States and soviet Governments with a further request that a French Representative shouldbe added to the Commission as a full member for all purposes. It is not necessaryfor us to take a decision on this proposal at the present stage. I would, however,recall the statement of the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the3rd August when he spoke of France being raised &quot; to her rightful place among all the Great Powers of Europe,&quot; adding that &quot;we shall presently once againhave to deal with the problem of France and Germany along the Rhine, and fromthat &quot;discussion France can by no means be excluded,&quot; and that he &quot;lookedforward to the closest association of the British Empire, the United States andthe Russian and French representatives in the settlement of these importantEuropean problems.&quot; I would also recall that in the terms of reference of theEuropean Advisory Commission it is stated that these terms of reference &quot;willbe subject to review by the three Governments if circumstances should arise which call for an extension of the membership and competence of theCommission.&quot;A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,26th August, 1944.12493   [28095]
