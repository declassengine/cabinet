DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).secret.P.  (kO) 199 ReviseCopy No.&apos;June 12th/ WAR      CABINETPREPARATIONS AGAINST INVASIONLEAFLET SUBMITTED BY THE MINISTER OF information herev/ith submit a redraft of this leaflet inthe light of the discussion which toc*k place in the WarCabinet this m&amp;rning, Wednesday, June 12th,    The alterationshave been underlined.    The original Section VII has been omitted, but I have added an alternative paragraph in whichthe public is warned that instructions will not be issued6h the wireless.It is suggested that the leaflet should beentitled:-If   theINVADERcomesWhat to do - and how to do it.D. C.

The Germans threaten to invade Great Britain.      Ifthey do so they will he driven out by our Navy, our Armyand our Air Force.      Yet the ordinary man and woman ofthe civilian population will also have their part to play.Hitler&apos;s invasions of Poland, Holland and Belgium were greatly helped by the fact that the sivilian populationwas taken by surprise      They did not know what to do whenthe moment came.      You must not be taken by surprise.This leaflet tells you what general line you should take.More detailed instructions will be given you when thedanger comes nearer.      Meanwhile? read these instructionscarefully and be prepared to carry them out.I.When Holland and Belgium were invaded,  the civilian population fled, from their homes..      They crowdedon the road.s, in cars? in carts, on bicycles and on foot, and so helped the enemy by preventing their ownarmies from advancing against the invaders,.      You mustnot allow that to happen here.      Your first rule,  there-fore, is:-(l)    IF THE GERMANS COME9  BY PARACHUTE, AEROPLANEOR SHIPo YOU MUST REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE.      THEORDER IS &quot;STAY PUT&quot;,If the Commander in Chief decides that theplaoe where you live must be evacuated, hewill tell you when and how to leave.      Untilyou receive such orders you must remain where you are.      If you run away, you will be exposed to far greater danger because you will bemachine-gunned from the air as were civilians in Holland arjd&quot;&apos;Belgium&quot;y and you will alsoblock the roads by which our own armies willadvance to turn the Germans out.II.There is another method which the Germansadopt in their invasions*      They make use of the civilian population in order to create confusion andpanic.      They spread false rumours and issue falseinstructions.      In order to prevent this5you shouldobey the second rule, whi?h is as follows(2)    DO NOT BELIEVE RUMOURS AND DO NOT SPREADTHEM.      WHEN YOU RECEIVE AN ORDER,  MAKEQUITE SURE THAT IT IS A TRUE ORDER AND NOTA FAKED ORDER.       MOST OF YOU KNOW YOURPOLICEMEN AND YOUR A. R, P.  WARDENS BY SIGHT,YOU CAN TRUST THEM.       IF YOU KEEP YOUR HEADS,YOU CAN ALSO TELL WHETHER A MILITARY officer is REALLY BRITISH OR ONLY PRETENDING TO BE SO.IF IN DOUBT ASK THE POLICEMAN OR THE AuRoPoWARDEN,      USE YOUR COMMON SENSE.

IV cRemember that if parachutists come down nearyour home, they will not be feeling at all brave.      Theywill not know where they areP they will have no food,they will not know where their companions are*     They will want you to give them food,, means of transport,, and maps.They will want you to tell them where they have landed.,where their comrades are, and where our own soldiers are.The fourth rule, therefore, is as follows:-(4)    DO NOT GIVE ANY GERMAN ANYTHING.      DO NOTTELL HIM ANYTHING.      HIDE YOUR FOOD and your BICYCLES.      HIDE YOUR MAPS.      SEE THATTHE ENEMY GETS NO PETROL.      IF YOU HAVE ACAR OR MOTOR BICYCLE, PUT IT OUT OF ACTION    .WHEN NOT IN USE.      IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO remove the IGNITION KEY; YOU MUST MAKE IT useless to ANYONE EXCEPT YOURSELF.IF YOU ARE A GARAGE PROPRIETOR, YOU MUSTWORK OUT A PLAN TO PROTECT YOUR STOCK of petrol AND YOUR CUSTOMERS&apos; CARS. remember that TRANSPORT AND PETROL WILL BE THEINVADER1S MAIN DIFFICULTIES. MAKE sure that NO INVADER WILL BE ABLE TO GET HOLD&apos;OF YOUR CARS, PETROL, MAPS OR BICYCLES.The Array, the Air Force, and the Local defence volunteers cannot be everywhere at once.     The ordinaryman and woman must be on the watch.      If you see anythingsuspicious, do not rush round telling your neighboursall about itw      Go at once to the nearest policeman,police-station, or military officer and tell thern exactly what you saw.      Train yourself to notice the exact timeand place where you saw anything suspicious, and try togive exact information.      Try to check your facts.      the sort of report which a military or police officer wantsfrom you is something like this:-&quot;at 5.50 p.m0 to-night I saw twenty cyclistscome into Little Squashborough from the directionof Great Mudtown.     They carried some sort of automatic rifle or gun.     I did not see anything like artillery.     They were in grey uniforms.&quot;Be calm, quick and exacts      The third rule, thereforis as follows(3)    KEEP WATCH.      IF YOU SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS,NOTE IT CAREFULLY AND GO AT ONCE TO the nearest POLICE OFFICER OR STATION, OR TOTHE NEAREST MILITARY OFFICER.      DO NOT RUSHABOUT SPREADING VAGUE RUMOURS.      GO QUICKLYTO THE NEAREST AUTHORITY AND GIVE HIM THE FACTS.

VoYou may be asked, by Army and Air Force officers to help in many ways,    For instance, the time may come when you will receive orders to block roads or streetsin order to prevent the enemy from advancing. Neverblock a road unless you are told which one you mustblock.    Then you can help by felling trees, wiring themtogether or blocking the roads with cars. Here, therefore,is the fifth rule:-(5) BE READY TO HELP THE MILITARY IN ANY WAY.BUT DO NOT BLOCK ROADS UNTIL ORDERED TODO SO BY THE MILITARY OR L.D.V. AUTHORITIES..VI.If you are in charge of a factory,  store or other works, organise its defence at once. If you are a worker,make sure that you understand the system of defence that hasbeen organised and know what part you have to play in it.Remember always that parachutists and fifth column men arepowerless against any organised resistance. They can onlysucceed if they can create disorganisation. Make certainthat no suspicious strangers enter your premises.You must know in advance who is to take command,y/ho is to be second in command, and how orders are to be transmitted.    This chain of command must be built up and you will probably find that ex-officers or N*&quot;C.O.&apos;s, whohave beenin emergencies before, are the best people toundertake such command.    The sixth rule is therefore as follows(6) IN FACTORIES AND SHOPS, ALL MANAGERS and workmen SHOULD ORGANISE SOME- SYSTEM NOWBY WHICH A SUDDEN ATTACK CAN BE RESISTED.VII.The six rules which you have now read give youa general idea of what to do in the event of invasion. more detailed instructions may, when the time comes, be given youby the Military and Police Authorities and by the local defence Volunteers; they will not be given over the wirelessas that might convey information to the enemy. these instructions must be obeyed at once.Remember always that the best defence of GreatBritain is the courage of her men and women. Here is yourseventh rule:-(7) THINK BEFORE YOU ACT.    BUT THINK ALWAYSOF YOUR COUNTRY BEFORE YOU THINK OF .YOURSELF.
