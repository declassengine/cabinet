THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-I-- I &quot; .....    &apos; I I -....U-......., Ml I .. ,,,, ,       , ,TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. IIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P.(40)174. ft*COPY k1.(Also C.O.S.(40)402.)27TH MAY, 1940.WAR CABINET.CONSTRUCTION OF AERODROMES AND naval bases BY THE UNITED STATES IN british colonies AITD DOMINIONS.Aide Liemoire by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.The Marquess of Lothian in Telegram No.314 of24-th May, suggested he should he authorised to informthe President that &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government recogmiise the seriousness of the new threat to America&apos;s security and thatwhile they are not in a position to discuss&apos; any modifications of sovereignty they would he prepared to consider immediatelease of areas to the United States for construction ofair fields or naval stations on any of those islands whichthe United States consider important from the point ofview of its own defence&quot;.He understands that the places in which theUnited States are most interested are Trinidad,Newfoundland and Bermuda.2.     We have given brief consideration to this proposal and from a military point of view we think that naval andair forces based at these points would materially improve the defences of the United States Atlantic seaboard againstseaborne and airborne attack from the Eastward and from. Brazil.5. We are therefore of the opinion that if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment authorised the Marquess of Lothian to put forward the suggestion it would be one that, if accepted, wouldreally meet a defence requirement of the United States. Atthe same time there is a risk that the proposal might appearto &quot;Isolationist&quot; circles as a bait to draw America into thewar.

4. We consider, subject to the agreement of theCanadian Government, that H.M. Ambassador at Yifashingtonshould be encouraged to make the proposal, as its acceptance would confer on ue two great advantages.(i) Our interests in these areas would be betterprotected as it will be mere than ever inthe interest of the United States to securethe outlying points in her defence system.(ii) The United Stages will, ba drawn closer to ourselves by the combined interest that both oountries will have in the areas inquestion^5. It occurs to us that an alternative method of approach, which might not arouse suspicion in the minds of the United States authorities that this is an attemptto embroil them, would be as follows:-   We should informthe United States Government that we have certainfacilities on these Islands, which we are prepared toplace at the disposal of United States forces.     Someimprovements and extension of these facilities might benecessary, which we might suggest should be carried outjointly by the two Governments.6. No doubt there will be constitutional and practicaldifficulties;    we are strongly of the opinion that theyshould not be allowed to stand in the way of an agreement,,which is obviously to the advantage of both parties.(Signed) PEIRSE.(V.

SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION AND WAR CABINET.&apos;.  .....    1     iii      .............   [        ii.. 1Prom: UNITED STATES OP AMERICA.. Decypher.      The Marquess of Lothian (Washington)24th May, 1940.D.      1. 31a.m. 25th May, 1940.R.    11. 20 a.m, 25th May, 1940.IMMEDIATE.SECRET.American- anxiety about its own security has broughtto the--frr\nt in public discussions the question of thefuture of British and Prenoh islands off eastern coast ofAmerica.     Many suggestions&apos;are being made for their disposal&quot;to United States in part payment of war debts.     Presidenthas always discouraged such discussion.      Privately I saythat there can be no question of discussing any suchtransaction at present.      I think however that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should seriously consider officially a formaloffer to United States to allow it to construct aerodromes and naval stations on British islands which are of importanceto its security.      I understand that the two places UnitedStates authorities are most concerned about are trinidad and Newfoundland:    Trinidad because an air base there wouldenable United States to deal with possible German and Italianair developments in (?Brazil) threatening the Canal, and newfoundland because of possible German threats (2 grps.undec.) (? overthrew rights of Iceland, and which to-day isquite undefended.      They are also interested in facilities atBermuda.      If you agree I should like tc be authorised toinform the President that His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the seriousness of the new threat to America&apos;s security andthat while they are not in a position tc discuss any modifications of sovereignty they would be prepared toconsider immediate lease of areas to the United States for construction of air fields or naval stations on any of these islands which the United States consider important frem thepoint of view of its own defence.     In effect this is only an exten&amp;ien of the proposal that was informally agreed to last year but never carried out.     I would not connect itat all with war debts instalment but I consider public announcement of our readiness to help the United states in organising its defence in this way would make a deepimpression here- and in practice would add to security ofour position and would involve active co-operation betweenthe United States and British Commonwealth in naval and air defence.     No member of administration has said anything tome.If you act now it would have all the advantage ofspontaneity.      The sooner you can give me the decision the better, as if proposal is.to have full effect Congress oughtto vote-appropriation before it adjourns early in June.RepeateoS-to Ottawa telegram No. 62.
