THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT.W.P.  (40)  182.30th May, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken  to ensure the secrecy of thisdocument0H A R     CABINETMAN-POWER FOR HOME DEFENCE.Memorandum hy the Secretary of State for War.1. The following is the statement referred to in W.M. (40)146th Conclusions, Minute 802. The question of Home Defence has now been reviewedfrom the angle of manpower, and the following is a summary ofthe decisions which have been taken and are now in process ofbeing carried out.(a) All the 18 Divisions (17 British, 1 Canadian) now athome will be brought up to full strength in infantry.The average infantry strength of these Divisions a month ago was 90j&amp;.      All these men will be taken from Holding -Battalions and will have had 4 months? training.     Thiswill add 7,000 infantry to these 17 Divisions.     the holding Battalions will be filled up with personnel fromthe Infantry Training Centres;   this personnel will be supplemented by a direct intake which will &quot;oe trained bythe Holding Battalions themselves. -&apos;   This last is a departure from previous practice, since Holding Battalionshave not previously trained recruits from the earlier stages.(b) It is proposed to increase the number of HoldingBattalions in order to enable them to take another15,000 men.     These men will be supplied by the InfantryTraining Centres whose output will be accelerated.(c) It is proposed to continue accepting volunteers as atpresent.     These men will be posted at once to TrainingCentres, together with the ordinary intake of recruits.It is estimated that these volunteers will number perhaps10,000.(d) As a result of a recent Cabinet decision (W.M.(40)127th Conclusions, Minute 15) it is proposed to call up10,000 for service in Labour Units.      All of these can be trained as riflemen if necessary.(e) The Army intake in early June will continue as arranged.     This will number 17,000 for Infantry.secret copy NO. J
3. When action has been completed on these proposalsshall have available in this country 17 British and 1 Canad;divisions at full strength in Infantry and approximately ggHolding Battalions of some 800 men each; 18 of theseHolding Battalions already exist. &quot;Most of the above men ^have had at least 4 months&apos; training. The greater part of&quot;these divisions are, however, seriously deficient in equipsand in ancillary services.4. It will be seen that as a result of this series $proposals we may expect to have a total of an additional60,000 infantry available as riflemen in the shortest possible time.5. I have not given detailed figures as to the RoyalArtillery and the Royal Engineers, but it is not anticipate that there will be any great difficulty in ensuring aparallel increase in the strength in personnel of these a;when training equipment is ready for them.6. Recruitment for the   Royal Army Service Corps andthe Royal Army Ordnance Corps present greater difficulties,for here the Army comes in competition with the needs ofindustrsr.     The Royal Corps of Signals is presenting certaitraining difficulties.     Further examination of these protlis now proceeding.A.E*THE&apos; WAR OFFICE,30th May, 1940.
