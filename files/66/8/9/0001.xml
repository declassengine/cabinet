Government of Indiafs Viewso3. The Government of India consider in their TelegramNo. 1016 of 15th May that land support to the Afghans can best be achieved by a simultaneous advance -(a) by the northern line to support the AfghanGovernment in the Kabul area for which thefollowing force will be required:-9 Infantry Brigades2 A.Ao Regiments3 Field Regiments1 Mountain Regiment1 Medium, Battery(b) by the sotithern line to forestall Soviet troops on the line of Helmand and stabilise theKandahar area   For this task the followingwill be required:-3 Mobile Brigades4 Infantry Brigades1 A.A, Regiment2 Field Regiments1 Medium, Battery40 In addition a general reserve of 3 Infantry Brigadesand 3 Field Regiments-5 and a minimum of 50 heavy and 57light A.A, guns for base and L* of 0. protection in India,will be required,?5* The Government of India consider that the followingair forces will also be required:-Northern line cpmpqnent 5 SquadronsSouthern&quot;7lInQ component 4 SquadronsMain Striking Foroe      &quot; 5 SquadronsFighter &quot;bifonee India 4 SquadronsFrgntier&quot;WatclT&quot;and&quot;&quot;Ward 2 SquadronsReserve&quot; 1 SquadronTotal 21 SquadronsProvision of Forces ^Required06. The Government of India propose that these forces should be provided as follows:-A.A. requirements (3 A.A. Regiments    )plus 50 heavy and 57 light A.A.guns) By His/ ) Majesty1 s.R.A.F. units ( 14 Squadrons) ) Government.All other new requirements (18 Infantry      By India.Battalions, a::K?illary units, etc.)/     There are already 6 R.A*F. and 1 IndianForce squadrons in India.

The Government of India make it abundantly clearthat without the provision of the aircraft and A.A.  gunsthey consider their proposals for Afghanistan, impracticable anfwould not agree to undertake tham*7. The earliest date by which India could raise andequip the additional 18 battalions etc.  is May, 1941.    IfRussian aggression should materialise before this date the Government of India consider they could implement their plans for the Northern Line only, and providing thfrywere released from their commitments in Iraq, and Iran.After May, 1941,  they would be able to carry out theircomplete plan in Afghanistan and meet their commitments in Iraq and Iran.8. The Government of India point out that, if theRussian threat does not materialise, the extra forces they propose to raise will be available for operations elsewhere.Steps are now being taken to begin raising these forces.9. Before dealing with these recommendations in detailwe think it advisable to consider certain broad strategicfactors affecting the problem.General SJyateyin nonsideratipneu10.       In our view it is impossible to isolate the problemof supporting Afghanistan against Russian aggression from our general policy for the conduct of a war with Russia.In an appreciation of the military implications ofhostilities with Russia (Paper No. CCS.(40) 252) wepointed out that the only effective means by which we couldstrike at Russia was by air attack on the Cauo-asian oilfields.      No land or air action on our part in Afghanistancan have decisive results against Russia.     A successful attack in the Caucasus, however, would probably result intime in the economic and military collapse of the soviet and, as a corollary, in the cessation of Russian accpressionagainst Afghanistan.  Moreover,as one of the two main lines ofcommunication from European Russia to Afghanistan runs throughthCaucasus   area, air attack on the Caucasus should limit theextent of Soviet operations in Afghanistan.      \-/e must emphasise, however, that in present circumstances,and still more if Italy is hostile, we have not theresources for an attack on the Caucasian oilfields..11.       An invasion of Southern Afghanistan from Heratwould be an extremely  lengthy    operation for the russians and could only be carried out after a long period spent in developing communications and building up stocks.Again an advance through the Hindu Kush passes inthe North would be a formidable undertaking and we see no reason why the Afghan Army should not b.  able to holdthese passe-s given a small amount of technical assistancefrom us.Kabul is essentially the key to Afghanistan;    andthe real danger is likely to come from air attack on Kabul.This, combined with loss of revenue from the Northern    .Provinces which would almost certainly fall to the Russians,might well lead to the disruption of the Afghan Government,

The military problem,   is therefore primarily one ofthe air defence and internal security of the Kabul area.120       We see no prospect in the predictable future ofbeing able to provide either the air support or the A.A.-equipment on the scale suggested by the Government of India.Moreover, even if this equipment could be made available from home when the emergency arises, it is very doubtful if it would arrive in India in time to save the situationin AfghanistanoProposals for Supporting Afghanistan,,13o       We consider that the Commander-in-Chief, in India,who is in close touch with the problem, is the best judge of what is required, and that we must accept his appreciation of the scale of operstions necessary to ensure completesuccesso     There is no prospect, however, of our being ableto provide him with any of the additional troops orequipment which he requires for his planc     Since we mustbe prepared to fulfil the pledge of assistance which we havegiven the Afghan Government, the Commander-in-Chief mustprepare an interim plan making use of the resources whichhe has in India, and we must accept the risks involved in operations undertaken with relative small forces, and withoutthe requisite air support,,     Operations would probably have to be confined to the Kabul area,,14.       It is very desirable that everything possible shouldbe done to enlist the sympathy of the tribes   on both sides of the border, thus possibly accustoming them to the ideaof British and Indian forces going to the help of the AfghanGovernment in the event of a Russian attack, and so reducingthe dangers and difficulties on the line of communications*It might even prove possible to make use of offers of tribalassistance against RussiaQ15.       We cannot agree to the suggestion of the Government ofIndia that they might be released from their obligation tosend a division for the defence of the Anglo-Iranianoilfields in order to provide a force for Afghanistan.Russia may embark on operations in Iran and Afghanistansimultaneously and the security of the oilfields may well beof greater importance than Afghanistan,       Our support to afghanistan must not therefore be at the expense of our interests in IranBCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMANDEATIONS016.       Our conclusions and recommendations are as follows:-(i)    We must accept the appreciation of the Commander-in-Chief in India of the scale of operationsnecessary to afford full support to afghanistan,;.     His proposals, however, involvethe provision of air forces and army equipment which are not at present available.     TheComtnander-in-Ohief should therefore, prepare an interim plan, based on resources atpresent existing in India, operationspossibly being confined to the Kabul area.

(ii)   We do not agree with, the suggestion ofthe Government of India that they might be released from their obligations toprovide forces for Iran/Iraq.     In theevent of war with Russia these forces will almost certainly be required inaddition to forces to support Afghanistan.(iii)   We recommend that everything possible should be done to enlist the sympathy of the tribes both on the Indian sideof the frontier and in Afghanistan.(Sgd.)
