THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.WT P.(40)220./264 y, June 25th. 1940. Copy no war CABINET.BALLOONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.The Air Ministry are anxious that the Balloon Barrageshould be completed to the present arjproved establishment of2,000 flying balloons with adequate reserves at the earliestpossible date.      It will in fact be necessary to increase thisestablishment to cover new commitments, particularly on theWest Coast and in Ireland.The speed at which the barrage can be brought up toestablishment and extended and reserves built up depends onthe rate of output of the balloons and on any steps that can betaken to reduce unserviceability and- wastage which are largely due to deterioration and wear of the fabric.It was understood that the rate of production was limited by the supplies of raw cotton available and the capacity for spinning, weaving and proofing the material, and that theexisting production programme, which will achieve an output of800 balloons a month by October 1940, was the utmost that couldbe attained.It was also understood that the present requisitionfor 10,000 balloons which would require some 16,000 bales ofraw cotton, representing more than three times the entire crop of Sea Island Cotton for 1940, would take more than a year tosupply.The Minister of Aircraft Production suggests that ifthis requisition is doubled the rate of production can beincreased.-    An increase in the rate of production would bevery welcome.I should be glad to have a revised forecast of(. production as early as possible.A.
