THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.R.(40)187,(Also C.0.S,(40)414. )51ST. MY. 1940.COPY NO.IkWAR CABINET.ICELAND.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.The War Cabinet on 27th May invited, us to reporton the size of the garrison which, in our view, should bemaintained in Iceland..2. Subsequently7 on 27th Hay, the Foreign Secretaryasked that consideration should be given to this question -&quot;whether,in view of the Imminent and very grave peril tothis country,, it would not be better to withdraw at once,while there is yet time, a force which appears to be ineffective as it is and which cannot be reinforced&quot;.3, Our objects in going to Iceland were to preventthe enemy from establishing bases for light naval forces and aircraft in Iceland;    and to establish an advancedbase for use by units of the fleet and ships and aircraftemployed on reconnaissance duties.4. We estimated that no scale of seaborne attacklarger than a raid was likely;   but that we could notneglect the possibility of one or two large ships evadingthe blockade and landing several thousands of men withrations and stores for several weeks and the groundechelon and stores for a bomber unit.Iceland would be liable to a light scale *fbomber attack from Norway;    and there was always thepossibility of an airborne landing.In addition, the internal security commitmentwould be increased in the event of a bombing attack onthe local population.5. The meet these threats it was considered necessaryto secure the Reykjavik area including the Hval Fjordand the three landing grounds in that area;    to secure the landing ground at Akureyri (150 miles from Reykjavik onthe north coast), and to provide a reserve.The force we estimated as required to carry out these duties T/as &quot;of the order of a brigade.....

An infantry brigade and ancillary troops under IBrigadier Lammie is now established on the Island, andiiarrangements are being made whereby the Canadian Governmentwill replace this brigade by a brigade of Canadian troops,6, Reconnaissance, has since shown that large, areaswithin forty miles of Reykjavik and other areas in the Islandare also suitable as landing pounds.The immediate threat of air landings in Iceland isprobably slightly reduced owing to the pre-occupation ofGerman air transport in France,  and their probable retentionfor operations against the United Kingdom,       On the otherhand,  the chance of a German ship reaching Iceland has not materially altered,,To Mr. Howard Smith has pointed out that, in the opinion  -on Brigadier Lammie,  commanding the troops in Iceland,  andof himself,  the existing force in Iceland is insufficient to deny Reykjavik to the enemy and to provide for thesecurity of the naval base.       They considered that, owingto the absence of anti-aircraft guns and adequate artilleryto deal with air or naval - attacks on any scale, Reykjavikis liable to destruction by a few shells or bombs.       Theywere thus unable In. fact to protect the local population,who have been given an assurance of protection,,80 The question at issue appears to us to be whether the objects of our occupying Iceland still hold good in presentcircumstances.        If so, we must provide the force required bythe Officer commanding troops there to the best of our ability.        If not, it is for consideration whether we shouldnot withdraw the force altogether,9. In our opinion, our objects as laid down in paragraph above stil&quot;  hold good, particularly so since the consolidation of the German position in Norway,We consider,  therefore, that we must continue inoccupation of the Island and that sufficient forces for thisPurpose should be provided as early as possible.10.       Brigadier Lammie considers that the principaladditional troops required in Iceland are:-2-Rifle battalions &apos; Machine Gun BattalionProbably   1 additional Battalion next winter6 Flying Boats1 Battery Heavy Anti-Aircraft, GunsAd^iLional Coast Defences,11, In view of the present emergency it is not possibleto provide the heavy anti-aircraft guns required for effectivedefence ..    Nor are any flying boats available at present whichcould be based In Fceland,    As a temporary expedient it isproposed to meet the emergency requirements in air reconnaissance

&quot;by establishing refuelling facilities in Iceland for theR.A.F. flying boat unit in the ,Shetlands.      The questionof despatching light aircraft .to Iceland is also underinvestigation.We also propose that the Canadian Government shouldhe invited to consider urgently the possibility of providing a unit of Hudson aircraft which would provide a valuablereconnaissance screen and support against enemy landings.Summary12.        To sum up, we consider that it is most necessary toretain our forces&apos;in   Iceland and to reinforce them assoon as possible.      Wo therefore recommend that theCanadian Government should be formally requested toprovide without delay, a total of five battalions, one machine gun battalion and the necessary aircraft, withthe addition of one battalion next winter.(Signed)    R.H..
