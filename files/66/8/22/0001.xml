DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WARCABINET.COPY NO. X*(p -SUPPLY OF MILITARY APPRECIATIONS TO THE dominion prime MINISTERS.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.1.Several requests have recently been receivedfrom His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth ofAustralia for information or appreciations on various matters connected with the war situation.      At themeeting of the War. Cabinet on the 26th May     I referredto one of these cases, namely a request from the PrimeMinister of the Commonwealth for information under elevendifferent heads as to the operations proceeding on theWestern Front.      The Commonwealth Government have also raised generally the question of the supply of fullerinformation as to the war than that which they are atpresent receiving.2.        Ever since the outbreak of war it has been thepractice to send to the Prime Ministers of Canada, theCommonwealth, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa,for their most secret and personal information, a dailytelegram recording the progress of operations.      Sincethe German invasion of Holland and Belgium thesetelegramsx W.M.(hO)139th Conclusions, minute 3.

telegrams have been sent twice every day.      Recently itwas arranged that a military officer should be appointed on the Staff of the Dominions Office as a liaison officer with the War Cabinet Secretariat and the service departments, for the purpose of preparation of these telegrams and other communications of a similar nature.3.        In addition, copies of the Weekly Resume by theChiefs of Staff circulated to the War Cabinet are sent tothe Prime Ministers of the four Dominions.      In view oftheir characters these documents are necessarily sent byocean mail, and consequently in the case of the more distant Dominions they arrive several weeks after the events to which they relate.Special telegrams are also sent as regardsparticular developments as occasion arises.Apart from these communications it is thepractice for me to see the four Dominion high commissioners daily and to give them orally informationas to current events.h.        The Commonwealth Government, as well as other dominion Governments, have expressed their appreciation of the daily telegrams, but these telegrams, whilesetting out the individual facts of the progress of operations at the moment when they are compiled,naturally cannot present a complete picture of theposition, as a whole, nor can they, except within narrowlimits, give an indication how the situation is expectedto develop in the future.      The requests received fromthe

the Commonwealth Government are clearly intended toelicit fuller information of this nature, which is underthe present procedure not provided for.5.        The oversea Dominions are committed to this war, like ourselves, to the utmost limit of their resources, and I feel that it is of the utmost importance that everything possible should be done to provide, notonly the Commonwealth Government, but the Governments ofthe other Dominions also with the fullest possible information as to the war situation.      If we are tosecure the maximum co-operation of the Dominions and toensure that any measures of Dominion assistance which maybe desired at any given moment shall be readily forth-coming, we must show ourselves ready to take themcompletely into our confidence.      At present there is somesign of a feeling that we are not telling them all that weshould.      There can, I feel, be no doubt that anyrequests which we may find it necessary to make will themore speedily be answered in a favourable sense if theDominion Governments have been prepared, by advanceknowledge of the general situation and guidance as tothe manner in which events are likely to develop, forsuch requests being made and if the requests do not comeupon them as a &quot;bolt from the blue&quot;.      Similarly, if atany time developments of a striking character take place(particularly developments unfavourable to the allied cause), there is every advantage in the DominionGovernments having been to some extent warned of thepossibilities in advance.      Apart from the effect on theDominion Governments themselves,  such advance warning mayenable

enable the Dominion Governments to prepare public opinion in the Dominion for the development when it takes place and thus lessen the shock to a community which,  owing toits distance from the scene of conflict, inevitably will fail to appreciate the trend of events without specialguidance.6.       We have in the past been able to obtain specialauthority to coramunicate secretljr to the Dominion PrimeMinisters summaries of military.ry appreciations submitted tothe Cabinet here as well as reports on the conclusions ofthe Supreme War Council.      I think it is most important that this practice should be continued and extended.7-        I hope therefore that the &quot;War Cabinet will giveits general approval to the principle that the DominionGovernments should be given continuously the fullest possible information virhich will enable them to realizethe general situation as it exists at the time and thefuture probabilities so far as they can be gauged.      entirely realize the impossibility, especially in a timeof stress such as the present, of preparing specialappreciations for Dominion Governments and it has beenmade clear to the Commonwealth Government that they cannot expect this.      I feel, however, that the needs of thesituation would be&quot; met if it were generally accepted that,whenever any paper on the military aspect of the war was brought before the War Cabinet dealing with a subject which is likely to be of general interest to theDominions or of interest to some particular Dominion orDominions, the substance of the paper should becommunicated from the Dominions Office to the1. Prime Ministers

i (Jprime Ministers of the four Dominions for their most secret and personal information,      It might he that insome, or even in many, cases it would he thoughtinadvisable to communicate the conclusions of the.WarCabinet, on the ground that this would involvedisclosure of military plans, a knowledge of which should,,in the national interest, be restricted within the narrowest limits.      In such cases, however, it wouldcertainly be of assistance if the Dominion Prime ministers could be made aware of the appreciation which the advisers of the United Kingdom Government had made of theposition and the arguments adduced for and against somecourse of action, without their being necessarilyinformed of the decision which had been taken.8.        If this, view is accepted in principle, the most convenient method of carrying out the general policy would, I suggest, be that I should have discretionthat, when a paper of this kind is circulated to theCabinet, I should have discretion to communicate itssubstance to the Dominion Prime Ministers.      TheQuestion how much of any such paper should becommunicated could best be settled between the dominions office military liaison officer referred to above and theWar Cabinet Secretariat, who would, of course, consult withthe Department concerned in any case of doubt.0.Dominions Office,3rd June, 19h0.
