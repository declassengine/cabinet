COPY NO._2-18TH JUNE.  192+0.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER IN THE    ARMY.Memorandum by the Secretary&apos; of State for War.Until recently the policy of the Army has been to take inmen on a regulated plan based on certain factors such as available equipment and training facilities, the rate ofdespatch to and anticipated casualties    of the ExpeditionaryForce, an^ subject to the need for leaving in Industry as many men as possible, especially tradesmen.2. The number of men in the Army at Home today, includingDominion troops is about 1,313,000, made up as follows:-275,000320,000151,000i3;ooo1+2,600Field Army Troops ex B.E.F.-&quot; &quot; &quot;      in U.K.Air DefenceCoas-t DefenceHome Defence BattalionsHolding Battalions (under disposal instructionsto make up Field force units) 2+9,000Training Units         (half to make up field force Units) 365,000Misc. Establishments 59,2+00Canadians 22,000Australians and New Zeaianders 16.0001,313,000*The average monthly intake is just under   50,000 under theNational Service Act, and about 27,000 volunteers.* &apos;Note.    From the point of view of immediate use it must berealised that apart from the 90,000 about to be called up, Air Defence of Great Britain and coast defenceamount to 16/4.,000, while some 150,000 of the   grandtotal have less than two months service.     The total figure includes 2+5,000 R.A.M.C. , 2+5,000 R,Aa0,C*,and 130,000 R.A.S.C , who are not trained to fights

5. In order to increase tlie number of men for HomoDefence and to replace casualties it has been arranged that an extra 90,000 men shall be called up in the nextfortnight, which vith volunteers and those already called up in June will make a total of about 165,000 for themonth. -4.-        In July if is intended to call up 50,000 to meetnormal expansion and wastage;    20,000 as an addition tothis figure,&apos; this increase will for the most part be trained and accoi-imodated by expanding the capacity ofTraining units;    30,000 to increase the manpower of anti-aircraft defence;    50,000 to form sixty new Home Defencebattalions.      With an anticipated 30,000 volunteers this total addition in July should be 180,000..5.-        This expansion will call tor an exceptionalincrease in officers-     This demand will be supplied in themain from the Officers Emergency Reserve..6..        It is proposed to create a number of specialcompanies of men selected from all units of the Array tobe trained as storm troops.      The intention is to aim atthe ultimate establishment of fifty such companies.7. Urgent consideration is being given to the increaseof establishments of battalions and to the question of adding a fourth battalion to the infantry brigade.    these would be made up from the extra recruits now about to be trained..8. Assuming that American supplies arrive there shouldbe no difficulty about rifles.      Similarly, clothing and personal equipment is adequate on active service scale,viz.. one suit per man.      On the other hand there will bea shortage of respirators due to damage and losses in theb    p   ^o ^ J o j-&apos; *3?rom the point of view of accommodation, which willbe mainly tentage for the present, the only difficultywill be in such stores as palliasses (though there areample- blankets), tables and cutlery.      In the coming winterthis srjecial Intake added to the return of the B.E.P. willmake the provision of additional hutting essential.A high standard of instruction cannot be expected in tlie new battalions.(Intd.)
