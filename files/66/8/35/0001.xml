THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC M&amp;JESTY-S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 1 0-7-------,_,__ X u iIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NOo  UAWAR CABINET.INTERNAL SECURITY IN IRAQ,Memorandum bv the Chiefs of Staff Committee.1, The adherence of Iraq to the cause of the Alliesis in considerable danger.     Anti-British feeling runshigh, particularly among the younger army officers.    Thereare doubts as to the loyalty of the army in an emergency and German exploits do more than merely evoke admiration.There are reports of Jlfth Column organisation, though these reports do not give precise information on the sizeor the power of such organisation as exists.     These arenot the only indications of coming disturbances, hut theyare the most important ones.2. The Iraqi Government has, up&apos; till recently, given&apos;the impression that it faces these difficulties with ameasure of impotence, or possibly connivance.      In lateMay certain repressive measures against public demonstra-tions,  and the press, were taken,      The Government havebacked this more resolute attitude with what may turnout to be a genuine effort to keep the younger officersunder control.3. The results of these measures are promising sofar as they go.      It is not, however, considered thatthey go far enough.      The attitude of the press is but asymptom,  and it seems that \:e should be wise to press our efforts for the betterment of the situation as far as toinclude those causes of the disease which we can identify.The following suggestions are put forward for considerationby the  v/ar Cnbinet.(i)    It should be demanded of the Iraqi Governmentto play their responsible p&amp;rt in implememting,not merely the letter, but the spirit of theTreaty,  and that public declarations, spokenor written, by Iraqi statesmen are essential.fijg C R E Tog.

An increase of propaganda, through theMinistry of Information, regardless ofexpense, should be initiated at once and every effort made to counteract Germanand Italian propagandao    The economic position of the people, as affected bythe war, should be examined, and moneyspent directly or indirectly for itsbetterment.    The importance of broadcasting cannot be exaggerated,,   Itis suggested that the Iraqi Governmentshould be induced to broadcast british propaganda from the Baghdad BroadcastingStation,,Ibn Saud should be encouraged in every way(including &quot;material&quot; encouragement)to a greater extent than heretofore, to demonstrate his friendship to thiscountry^The French should be encouraged to take aliberal line over the future of Syria, anddeclare the fact publicly,,   This might be fulfilled by such a step as a promise to ratify the Franco-Syrian Treaty after thewar0Since we are dealing with Eastern countries and people, the power of gold appliedpersonally, should not be forgotten.(Signed)   E.E.C.
