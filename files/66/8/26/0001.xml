THIJL 13 THE PROPERTY OF1113&quot;mfSrjmiG !-.J?.s?Yt.3 (yy-fraEuaEra?SECRET, COPY lTo.2-0W..P.  (1+0) 196.6th June, 191+0.TO EE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may &quot;be takento ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR      CABINETRE-ORGANISATION AND RE-EQUIPMEITT OF THE british expeditionary FORCE.Memorandum hy the Secretary of State for War.1. We have now In England, returned from France, the elements of twelve divisions, of the corns troops of threecorps, and of three corps headquarters (51st Division is stillin France).It is necessary to decide at once on the policy for re-organization and re-equipment.      If an attempt ismade to re-equip the full twelve divisions,it will inevitably mean that each division can only be given theminimum of equipment on which to train and that it willbe a long time before we can get complete formationsre-equipped.     From the point of view of the equipmentproblem it is very advantageous to reduce the number of divisions..2* The proposals are as follows :-(a) To re-form the five regular divisions andorganize them into two corps, each with oorpsheadquarters, as a prospective british expeditionary Force.     The remaining corpsheadquarters is being re-constituted for earlydespatch to France(b) To amalgamate the territorial (iIvisitaB with theirduplicate divisions, the resulting division talcingthe number of the original division.     This meansamalgamation as follows :-(i)   12th Division and&apos;i+1+th Division to become1+1+th Division,(ii)   23rd Division and 50th Division to become50th DivisionsAll four of these divisions have bean inFrance, so that it will be some time before    ,the amalgamated divisions will be fit to        Ytake the field,,(iii)    66th Division and 1+21&apos;id Division to becomei-!-2nd Division^(iv)   6lst Division and 1+Sth Division to become1+8th Division,(v)   lj.6th Division and 1.1.9th Division to become1.5.9th DivisioiioOf these six divisions, only one division in each pair - (l;.2nd, i+6th and 2+SthDivisions) has been in France*

3* This amalgamation will in effect mean that thereis only one divisional headquarters for the two divisions,and that artillery and ancillary services will &quot;be on asimilar basis.     But it is proposed to retain the infantry brigades of both divisions in the amalgamation.     Inaddition to the five Territorial Army divisions, we shall then have the equivalent of lhr independent brigades.Of these, five will &quot;be used to raise the motorisecl divisions in the Army, of two brigades each, to the normal figureof three, making all divisions homogeneous.     The remaining9 brigades will be retained as independent groups for homedefence, without prejudice to their rejoining theirdivisions if bifurcation is authorised, at a later date,for operations outside Great Britain.Lj.. This solution not only enables the amalgamateddivisions to be equipped at a faster rate than would bethe case if there were 10 instead of five divisions, butalso provides a number of independent brigades, eminentlysuitable for use in the defence of the country, and equipped with personal equipment, but on a lower scale otherwise,than the divisional bripjades.5* It is proposed to use the 16 regular battalionswhich are being withdrawn fmn India to &quot;stiffen&quot; certainselected Territorial Army divisions, on a basis of postingone regular battalion to an infantry brigade.6, These proposals are without prejudice to a futuresplit of the joint divisons referred to in paragraph 2.When this takes place it will be a great advantage to beable to make use of any regular battalions which it may bedecided to withdraw from the Middle East to &quot;stiffen&quot;brigades on the lines proposed in paragraph 5*7. I ask my colleagues to approve these proposals.THE WAR OFFICE8th June, 191+0AfE.
