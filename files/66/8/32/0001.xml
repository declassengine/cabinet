MSppCMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMHNT.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may he takfen toensure the secrecy of this document-    ISJj C g E T. \JW.P.(40) 202 (Revise).WaR cabinet July! 1940. w     n,VRT-KT[?m COPY No. _6lPROPOSED INSTRUCTIONS gOR AIRCRAFT and submarines WITH REGARD TO SHIPPING!- IN HOME WATERS.Memorandum &quot;by the First Lord cf the Admiralty.During the last three months a number of orders have been issued with.M. Ships and aircraft to sink merchant ships at sight in the North Sea andthe Skagerrak and off the Norwegian, Danish and German coasts.   I propose toissue instructions consolidating these orders;   and in view of the danger of invasion and the habitual use by the enemy of disguise, I suggest that the newinstructions should extend the area within which sinking at sight is permitted.The proposed instructions to submarines and aircraft are attached as annex i.    They go beyond the previous instructions in that they allow submarine-ines to attack any ship whether at sea or in port in the North Sea Between thelatitude approximately cf Narvik and the Straits of Dover, and east of curEast Coast mined area.   All the ports in the area are either enemy or enemy-occupied, except Swedish ports, and these are expressly excluded.   Theinstructions for attack by aircraft cover an area of much the same lengthfrom north to south, but its western limit is (over most of its length)about 90 miles east of the Western limit of the submarine area.No neutral vessel is likely to attempt to enter or leave the Baltic,but provision is made to ensure the safety of those neutral ships of whosevoyage we have been informed in advance.   A communication to the Governmentsconcerned will be found in Annex II.I now seek the authority cf the War Cabinet for putting the foregoingproposals into force.    They have been amended by the Naval andAir Staffs inthe light of the discussion at the meeting of the Chiefs of Staff onthe 14th June last (C.O.S.(40) 181st Meeting)A.V.A.ADMIRALTY, S.W.1.5th July, 1940.

2. ;       Ships- in Swedish territorial Yfaters may only be attackedif under way; ships located in the Channel defined in AdmiraltyMessage 11 53/1 2th April may &quot;be attacked at sight, -3.

ANNEX II.Notification to Neutral Governments.Indiscriminate attacks &quot;by German forces against neutral shipping in the North Sea and in particular against vessels desiringto enter or leave the Baltic has, as theSwedishFinnishEstonian Government will be aware, resulted in the totalLatvianLithuanianexclusion of innocent neutral shipping from the North Sea area.In these circumstances His ilajosty1s Government feel themselvesconstrained to remove the restrictions which they have.hithertoplaced upon the action of their own armed forces in this area,since it is clear that vessels found there can only be engaged in enemy military operations.    British forces have accordingly been instructed to attack at sight all vessels within the Easternportion of the North Sea and Kattegat area bounded by the followinglimits:-(a) the parallel of 69c North.(b) the longitude of 0o 09&apos; West and the eastern edge ofthe ares, dangerous from mines, established in notice to Mariners No.2931 of 30.12.39, and the longitudeof 2031&apos; East.(e)     the latitude of Ostend.2.       Should the Swedish        Government by any chance desireFinnishEstonianLatvianLithuanianthat one of its vessels should attempt to enter or leave the Baltic,special arrangements will be made by His Majesty1 s Government toensure its immunity from attack by British forces and for thispurpose any vessel intending to enter the Baltic should requestrouteing instructions from the Naval Control Service Officer atKirkwall, giving at least three days notice.   Any vessel intending to leave the Baltic should request routeing instructions from.M.Consuls at Stockholm        giving at least four days1 notice.HelsingforsTallinnKovno3.       In making the above communication you should emphasise thatthis is in fact a formality since in practice no neutral vesselshave attempted to enter or leave the Baltic since the invasion of norway, with the exception of pne Swedish vessel the S.S.BOTHNIAwhich was machine-gunned and captured by the Germans.
