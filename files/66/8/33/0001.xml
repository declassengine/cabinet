PLANS TO MEET A CERTAIN EVENTUALITY.Ai&amp; Memo! re for His Majesty&apos; s Ambassador at,,Washington.In the event of Prance being forced to capitulate,we intend to continue the struggle0     The military situationwhich would confront us would be as follows:-General Situationo2o All French European and Northern African territory and resources would become available to the enemy in due course, though elements of the fleet and certain forces inthe French Empire might continue to assist in the war.It is by no means improbable, however;, that the Frenchmight be forced to hand over their fleet and our enemieswould thereby gain a considerable accession of navalstrengths      All existing European neutrals, with thepossible exception of Turkey, would eventually fall under german or Italian military or economic domination and ourposition in the Mediterranean and the Middle East might be-ultimately reduced to denying the Suez Canal to the enemy.The attitude of India might be doubtful, but, with thepossible exception of Eire, the whole Empire would increase their efforts in our supporto      Japan might attempt a moreactively opportunist policy in the Far East0     Russia wouldprobably become alarmed at Germany1s success and cease toassist hereAbility to Defeat German.-/o30 We consider that in these circumstances the defeat of Germany could still be achieved but only by a combination of economic pressure, air attack on economic objectives inGermany, and with its resultant effect on German morale, andthe creation of widespread revolt in the conquered territories.40 It would be essential to secure the British Islesas the main base for the operation of naval and air forcessince we could not maintain our air offensive against germany from the American Continent nor employ our fleet effectivelyunsupported by the naval resources of this country.The final issue will therefore hang at first on our ability to withstand the great effort which the enemy islikely to make against Great Britain in the immediate future.If we can withstand the effects .of large scale air attack against our industry., oiar ports and centres of population,by denying to the enemy air superiority over this countryand its approaches, we hope to resist invasion successfully.In this connection the direct danger is the extremevulnerability of our aircraft industryoAt the same time, we shall have to withstandintensified naval and air attacks against our seabornetrade, to meet which there is an acute shortage of destroyers and flying boats0

5,        We should he in a good position to control the economic resources of the   Allied Overseas Empires, and we couldexercise Naval control of the wider oceans and focal pointsleading to the &quot;blockaded area so     This pressure would not,of itself, bring about the defeat of our enernieso      To acnievethis, full Pan-American economic co-operation is essential sothat raw materials of the world may be controlled at source.In effect, our ability to defeat Germany would ultimatelydepend on a complete blockade of Europe, which must include the cutting off of supplies via Russia.     Any relief topopulations in territory   occupied by the enemy would onlyserve to prolong the struggleo60        Without the full, economic and financial co-operationof the whole of the American Continent, the task might in theevent prove too great for the British Empire single-handed.Nevertheless,, even if the hope of victory in these circumstancesappeared remote, we should continue to fight as long as it washumanly possible to do so,7. It has been suggested that,  in the event of the tP-itedKingdom being overrun by the enemy,  the struggle could becontinued by the British Fleet from the American Continent.In resisting invasion, however, the whole of our navalresources in home waters would be thrown into the defence and a successful invasion would automatically imply the lossof a large proportion of our fleet.      The remaining forces,operating from America, would be faced with considerable&quot;problems of maintenance,  supply and manning, and the combinedGerman and Italian fleets, possibly strengthened by capturedunits of the French navy, might extend their activities well beyond the confines of Europe.     Without our air weapon andwith our ability to exert economic pressure through sea-powerconsiderably reduced, our chances of victory would be virtuallyat an end, even with the full military and economic assistanceof the American ContinentoFar East.8. The collapse of France would provide Japan with the temptation to take action against French, British or Dutchinterests in the Far Easto     We see no hope of being able to despatch a fleet to Singapore.      It will therefore be vital that the United States of America should publicly declare herintention to regard any alteration of the status quo in theFar East as a pasub belli.West Indies and South America.9* We regard the maintenance of the status quo in the west indies as of military importance, but we believe this to be assured by a recent resolution of the United States Congressre-affirming the Munroe doctrine in which it was stated that theUnited States could not tolerate the transfer of the colonial possessions in America of a European power to any non-Americanpower.

Assistance we would require from the Americas.10. Our full requirements from the American Continentare clearly a matter- for detailed examination hut, in broad terms, they would be as follows:-(a) The immediate and vital requirement wouldbe the provision at once of first line aircraft (including flying-boats)9.       . -destroyers., light naval craft, military equipment and supplies necessary tomaintain our defence forces in being,whilst our own production is beingdisorganised by the enemy.offensive andour reserves expended.     personnelpossibly on a voluntary basis,  to assist in manning ships and aircraft    are alsoneeded,,(b) For the further prosecution of the war weshould require arrangements to ensure;-(i)    the stoppage at source of all supplies to enemy countries andterritory in enemy occupation,and full co-operation In our contraband control against theremaining European neutrals, includingAsiatic Russia,,(ii)    the supplies of food, munitions,and raw materials, if necessary ona credit basis.,(ixi)    the provision of merchant shipping topljr between the Americas and theUnited Kingdom,(c) The Government    of the United States ofAmerica should add to their declarationregarding the West Indies a furtherdeclaration to the effect that any alteration to the status quo in theFar East would be regarded&quot;by them as ac a bus bellio
