THIS DOCUMENT 1*8 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.17.P. (UP) 176.28TH MAY,  19u1. COPY NO.    QOWAR CABINET,EXCESS PROFITS TAX.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.As I have to make a statement in the House of Commonstomorrow afternoon on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill,I ask as a matter of urgency for the concurrence of the WarCabinet in the proposal that the Excess Profits Tax should beraised to 100% in its application to all undertakings and notmerely in its application to &quot;controlled undertakings&quot;.Under the new Emergency Powers (Defence) Regulation,the Minister of Supply has power by Clause 1 to declare any war production undertaking a controlled undertaking and there-upon the undertakers are to carry on the undertaking inaccordance with orders made or directions given by any one ofthe Ministers concerned with questions of war production andof labour.Under Clause 2 of the Regulation the appropriate minister may, where necessary in the interest of the public safety, etc.give directions to any undertaking although it is not acontrolled undertaking.It had been proposed that the 100% Excess Profits Taxshould apply only to controlled undertakings which are, ofcourse, the establishments which will be principally engaged,directly or indirectly, on Government orders and to whichadditional labour will be directed; other trades and businesseswould continue to pay 60%.But I have received representations with which I agree,from the Minister of Supply both that great practical diffioultieswill arise in properly and fairly selecting the undertakings tobe declared controlled if this declaration carries with it ahigher tax liability and that, on grounds of equity, it is notright to put the imposition of 100% Excess Profits Tax on war production undertakings alone.    He instances the textile industry where very few firms can be said to be principallyengaged upon war production;    and he points out that those firms which have placed themselves at the disposal of the Governmentwould be likely to be the more helpful and patriotic ones,

9 9The First Lord of the Admiralty has informed me thathe concurs in the view of the Minister of Supply.I think also that, in the very grave times through which we are passing; it will generally he expected toy industry itself and will also accord with public feeling that the100/o rate of duty should apply universally while the warcontinues.I should like authority so to announce, the 100$rate applying from 1st April last.(Initialled)    K.W.Tre asury Ohambera,  S.
