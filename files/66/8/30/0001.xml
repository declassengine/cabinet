Up to the present,  it has been our policy toencourage the Balkan States to   form themselves into abenevolently neutral bloc.     This has, in fact, been partof our long-term major strategy of building up our resources for a long war.     Our Balkan policy has alwaysbeen considered on the basis of a neutral Italy.We are already committed to assist Greece, Roumaniaor Turkey in the event of an attack on any of those countries.3. We are how confronted with a new situation in whichthe position in Prance may in the near future become criticaland Italy is hostile.     Moreover, we are advised that unless Germany is able to improve her economic positionmarkedly in the near future, she will be in danger ofcollapsing in 1941.      In this situation, we consider itimperative to relate our Balkan policy to a short-termview, and to adapt it to the new conditions.Alignement Qf J^orces. V4. It would not be safe to make any assumption inadvance as to how a conflict in the Balkans, once started,would develop.      In all probability a general melee wouldresult, in which we should hope that Turkey, Greece and yugoslavia would be fighting on our side against Italy, whowould probably be joined by Hungary and Bulgaria on theother side.       Germany would probably intervene at an earlydate.       Roumania would be helpless.5. We do not rate the powers of resistance of yugoslavia and Greece as high.      In any event the Danube basin would soon be in German hands, and it would probably only be amatter of time before the whole of the Balkans^, at least as far as the Thracian Frontier of Turkey, was under German

or Italian domination.     A rapid subjugation of the balkans would probably involve a material diversion fromthe Western Front;   but a more deliberate invasion (whichcould be undertaken without drawing on the Western Front)would increase the economic dislocation referred to in.paragraph 7 below.Russia might well seize the opportunly of occupying Bessarabia.6. Nevertheless, now that Italy has entered the war against us we feel that there is little doubt that any military relief, however small, which we could obtain from a diversion in the Balkans would be to our immediate advantags ,even though we do not think that itwould materially affect the issue of the present battle inFrance.Economic Factors.7. From the economic point of view,  the advantages of spreading the war to the Balkans are on a short-termview more considerable.     The effect of military operations in the Balkans would be threefold:    communications wouldbe blocked with military transport;    agricultural andindustrial production would be interrupted in all spheres of operations, and to some extent elsewhere by the mobilisation of the Balkan armies;    and some damage to stocks and supplies as a result of operations or planneddemolitions would result.     The coming winter may well prove critical for Germany and we are advised by theMinistry of Economic Warfare that the partial loss of thisyearrs harvest in the Danubian Basin and the interruption of supplies of raw materials from the Balkan countriesgenerally, particularly Yugoslavia? would probably have important effects on German war economy next year.     the denial&apos; of Roumanian oil supplies would probably be decisive.The most we could hope for, however,  is a materialinterruption in the flow of these supplies, as a resultof sabotage and of the general dislocation of communications.8. We ourselves have little to lose economically fromthe spread of the-&apos; war into the Balkans,  since our importsfrom the Balkans have already been reduced to very small quantities as a result of the closing of the Mediterraneanshipping routes, and will be still further decreased now that ItaLy has entered the war.     Economically, therefore,there is no doubt that,  on a short-ternrview, it could onlybe to our advantage to bring about war in the Balkans, moreespecially before the coming harvest.     There are indications that Germany shares this view, since she appears to be making great efforts to keep the Balkans neutral.9. On a longer-term view (some 15 months in thecase of the harvest, but considerably less in the case of mineral production)  it might appear that the economiceffects of Balkan intervention at the present stage would react against,us, since Germany would by then have beenable to re-establish communications and to increase herimports from the occupied territories.   The long-term

disadvantages, however, are inherent in any event and are more serious if we do hot force the immediate issue since itis clear that as soon as Germany has reduced her commitments in France, she would he free to exploit the Balkans whenevershe liked with little or no opposition and. without the consequent interruption of her supplies which opposition would entail,Political Aspect,10..        From the political point of view, the overrunningof the Balkans by our enemies in the absence of any directsupport from our own forces, would almost certainly produceunfavourable reactions on our position in the Middle East,  *our military position in the Mediterranean and the middle east would be made considerably more difficult.     On theother hand, if we are ever to induce the Balkan Powers toenter the war on our side, we must do so while France isstill fighting, since in the possible event of a collapsein France while the Balkans were still neutral, the lastchance of bringing them in would have gone and they wouldquickly fall under enemy domination without a struggle.11. We consider, therefore, that if would be to our advantage in the present situation to encourage Yugoslavia  -and Greece to enter the war on the side of France, turkey and ourselves.     We recommend that we should make a direct and frank approach to the Turks, putting to them clearly the issuesat stake and urging them \under our own lead, to persuadeYugoslavia and Greece to take up arms on out side.Rec ommend at i ons.IS.        To sum up, we recommend:-(a) That our policy should be to do all we canto induce Greece and Yugoslavia to intervene on the side of Turkey, France and ourselves.(b) That we should make a direct and frankapproach to Turkey to concert with greece and Yugoslavia to form a common Balkanfront on our side.( c) that we should concert our policy withthe French on the above lines with theminimum delay.(Signed)    .C.L.IT, HEWALL.DUDLEY POUND.-R.H..
