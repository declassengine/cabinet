As a result, we haveincreased the output of trainers to meet his present necessities.Further, we have repaired the aircraft at his trainingdepots and also supplied spares, thus bringing into operation alarge number of machines that were idle.This is not a function of the Ministry of aircraft production, but was put into effect at the request of theSecretary of State as a temporary measure,I hold the view that engine production is now satisfactoryThere is a considerable improvement in Columns 7 and 9 and alsoin the free embodiment loans.There is now a pressing need for more airframes. HereI rely on a bigger production shortly in Scotland and in York-shire? for which I have made provision^The supply of aircraft is now in excess of the availablepilots.      The present output can be sustained and increased.(Intd,)    B..stry of Aircraft Production,Millbank,8.W.I.
