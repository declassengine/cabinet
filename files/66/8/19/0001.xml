WAR   CABINETWESTERN FRONT - BRITISH MILITARY    POLICY.Report fry the Chiefs.of Staff committee we have &quot;been instructed by the Was?  Cabinet s tolaalee recommendations as to the a?reply wtaJLcli   s&amp;omM toegiwii to the Freneli demands foa? assistsnae on the Western0F3*ont (vide message ^t*om M. mud. to the Prime MinisterNo. 1230/3)3.       &quot;The arguments for and against acceding to these demands are as follows:-Arguments in favour of supporting France .3, The outstanding reasons for doing everything possibleto sustain French resistance are -(a) A military and economic drain is forced on germany by the maintenance of her forcesin the field against France0(b) Large German land and air forces are contained,which could otherwise be employed in other theatres of war,(c) The French fleet, which is important,particularly in the Western Mediterranean,remains0effective,(d) France remains available as a base for operations against Italy especially asregards air operations against Italianindustrial targets,(e) The French North African Forces would containsome Italian forces.x W.M.

(f) Some Fx-ench support tc Turkey remainspracticableo(g) So long as Prance continues to fight, Spainmay be able to preserve her neutrality0(h) The French Colonial Empire remains stable.(i) The collapse of French resistance would be amost serious shock to the people of thiscountry and the Dominions0(3)    Finally., and most important of all, a France whichhas capitulate el. io Germany may well be ruled by a pro-0e5*fikjn Governments which, in the face, of therigours of our blockade and the bombardment ofFrench fcesritory might     w&amp;dA join the ranks ofour enoEti-os with all the military consequence   :that this implies.-:Arguments against suppertin^ France04. On the other hand. the:^ are powerful militaryarguments against acceding ia the French request.-*(i)    From all we have seen and heard of the leaders   ofFrancoy wo got the impre-ssioii that they have losthope of victory,.(ii)    The French have failed to hold a short, well &apos;fortified line, and have lost  some twenty-five divisions;      it therefore seems extremelyimprobable that they will be able to hold amuch longer line, which from all accounts,they have made no real effort to strengthen.Nor have they made any serious attempt torecapture the bridgeheads over the Somme,which are now in German hands0(iii)    It is extremely doubtful whether any forces that wo oro. send in the o.car future willmake any difference to the course of the battle which txio P3?oxw)b. regard as imminent *and all3go u.. lo doatsivo,(iv)    So far as Home Defence is concerned, thesituation has been radically altered by theGerman occupation of the Low Countries andthe Channel ports,     This confers upon the enemy the ability to bring their short-range bomber and fighter aircraft in superior numberswithin striking distance of this country,and correspondingly improves their chance ofobtaining local air superior!ty0     Everyfighter withdrawn from this country increases the risk of a decisive air attack on, or  a successful invasion of., this country.

(v) We endorse the opinion of the Commander-in-chief, Home Forces, that the forces atpresent in this country are, by reason oftheir lack of equipment and of training,barely adequate to meet a serious seaborneinvasion.     The return of the B.E.Fo, onwhich 1VL Reynaud places so much emphasis,  .though improving considerably the calibre ofthe man power available, does not at themoment greatly increase our defensive power,owing&apos; to the fact that they have lost all their equipment.(vi) Any forces despatched to France can virtuallybe written off.       So far as the land forces are concerned their base will be too faraway to permit their evaoiaatlais. being given any air support from the United. Kingdom.Apart from this, the maintenance of both land and air forces operating in France will be apermanent drain which, in the case of fighters,cannot be sustained without taking unacceptablerisks at home.-5, From the above arguments it will be appreciated thatthe United Kingdom is already dangerously exposed to a riskof decisive air attack and/or invasion.     We cannot, however,ignore the grave military consequences, particularly thosestated in paragraph 3(3) above which might arise should wegive no further support to France.      In consequence, we aredriven to recommend the acceptance of still further risks by sending reinforcements of the following order -

Land Forces.60 The first step which we recommend is, tore-establish a B.E.F. Headquarters in France.       Thisshould have a good pyschological effect on the French.7. As regards the despatch of Divisions to France,the position is as follows.The Canadian Division is in the most advancedstate of readiness for despatch overseas;    it isnow fully trained with its equipment nearing completion.     The Canadian Division constitutes themost effective mobile reserve for the defence ofthis country and can consequently he less easilyspared than any other Division,,8. The 52nd (T.^0) Division is fully trained andhas its full equipment of Bren carriers, Bren gunsand anti-tank rifles.     It has, however, only 12anti-tank guns out of an establishment of 48 and isdeficient in artillery.   &apos; This Division   could,however, be completed and be made ready for service bytransferring to it the artillery including A.T.forces of the 49th Division.The 52nd Division could commence to proceedoverseas within about seven days.9. The 43rd Division, which is next in order of readiness, has only just completed Company training,and is deficient in certain essential items of artillery equipment.     It is possible that a certain amount

of the artillery could be collected from various sources or possibly even provided by the French.     If the gravedeficiencies in training and equipment of this Division are accepted, it could be made ready for despatch sometimeduring the latter half of June.10.       It will be necessary to sena a proportion of Corpstroops with these divisions the details of which can besettled later.     The Corps Artillery ought to include a proportion of heavy and light A.A. guns and than jpossibilitiesare now being explored.     They can, however, only beprovided at the expense of the A.D.G.B.11,       After the despatch of the aritllery for this force,only about 450 field guns and 42 anti-tank guns will remainin this country,,12.       As regards the promise to despatch any furtherdivisions, we invite attention to the opinion expressedby the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, (vide paragraph4(v) above).The despatch of the two divisions would involve a grave risk to our security, and the promise to despatch anyfurther forces to France would have to be contingent on thesituation at the time when they become available for despatchoverseas.     This will not be in the very near future.Air Forces13.       As regards bombing aircraft, we intend to bring the six squadrons now in France up to full operational strengthas soon as possible.     The remainder of the Metropolitanbomber force will remain based on this country, and willcontinue to give support as in the past.

14.       As regards fighters, there a realreadythree squadrons in Prance and these are being brought up to strength -we most strongly recommend that no additional fightersshould be sent to Prance since even the three squadronsreferred to above cannot be maintained in circumstances of heavy wastage,  except at the expense of Home DefenceSqttadPons.15.       In addition to the above, the appropriate component of Army Co-operation aircraft will be despatched to Prance.Conclusions and Recommendations16,       The War Cabinet at their Meeting on the 2nd June35inyited us to consider the solution to this difficult problem on the lines of giving the greatest possiboesupport to Prance, without leaving the United Kingdomdangerously exposed to the risk of invasion.     In our view,the United Kingdom is already insufficiently inswedagainst full-scale air attack or invasion, and the despatchof any forces   to Prance at this juncture must further increase these risks to a dangerous degree.17, .     Nevertheless, the military disadvantages of theconsequences of a flat negative to the request of the french prime Minister leads us to the conclusion that we must accept the additional risks invoDve&amp;in assisting our Ally.18,       We recommend therefore that we should continue our policy of assisting Prance as much as possible, and that theextent to which we should be justified in doing ao isas follows:-(i) Land Forces   Re-establish a B..E.F. headquarters in France at once.(ii) The despatch of two Divisions and a proportion ofCorps troops to France as soon as possible,l,e.,., the 52nd Division starting within abouta week, and the 45rd Division following someten days later.3    W..M.

(iii) The despatch of further Divisions to hecontingent upon the general situation whenthey become nearer readiness for despatch.Air Forces.The six bomber and. three Hurricane Squadronsnow in France will be brought up tooperational strength as soon as possible, andwill be supplemented by Army Co-operaticnSquadrons which will be sent from the UnitedKingdom.

ANNEX.The following message from General Spears for Er. winston churchill:-Begins:-Message from ITons. Paul Reynaud to Mr. winston churchill.The battle which is to take place on our front isof such capital importance for the common cause that I wish again to draw your attention to the necessity for the double assistance of the British Army and the british air Police.As regards the Army, General Weygand points out thatthe British Expeditionary Corps should at the presenttime be fourteen divisions.     It may thus be concluded that divisions should be available and ready to be embarked,I would add that the 1.94,000 men that you have justrecovered from the Northern Front should, it appears,make it possible for the despatch of the 3 ava.iJ.&quot;abGiadivisions to be followed within a short period byreconstituted units of tested fighting value.With regard to aircraft, we need the help ofboth bombing aircraft and fighting aircraft.We request that the British bombing aircraft should provide before and during the battle which is going totake place, aH assistance at least as powerful as that given by it in the battle in the North.     It would appearthat this assistance can be given without your bombingmachines being based in France.As regards fighting aircraft, whose role isdecisive, since to leave the mastery of the air to theenemy would be to compromise the issue of the battle,I ask you to give us still more considerable assistancethan that which it provided in the North.     This aircraft will be unable to operate from English bases.     It is thus necessary for you please to decide that for the duration of the battle this aircraft will be based on Frenchgrounds.     Orders have already been given by us to ensurethat our grounds are placed at the disposal of the Britishfighter aircraft.     We are constructing new grounds forour own aeroplanes.     A Note on this subject and a Mapwere given this morning to General Spears for immediatetransmission to you.The effectiveness of British help on land and inthe air will, in large measure depend on the speed withwhich it is provided.     We have indications of animminent attack on various points of the Front,Message ends01230/2.Prom General Spears,
