We havegiven consideration to this matter, and we ask theWar Cabinet to approve the arrangements set out below.2. In a Memorandum^ which received the approval ofthe War Cabinet this morning, the Lord President of theCouncil set out the composition of the Hone defence executive as follows:-Commander-in-Chief, Hone Forces.      (Chairman).Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Bomber Command.Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Fighter Command.Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Coastal Command.A representative of the Admiralty.A representative of the Air Ministry.Sir Findlater Stewart.Senior Representative of the Ministryof Home Security.Chief of the Operations Section,Ministry of Home Security.A representative of the Ministry ofTransport.He expressed the view that this body would be able todeal quickly and efficiently, and without reference toany other authority, with most of the problems arisingduring the period of planning and preparation before an attack took place.35 W.M.

5. The Hone Defence Executive on the above lineshas already set about Its task.     We consider,however, that it is too unwieldy,as an instrument for the conduct of active operations which must be under the general direction of one man armed withthe necessary powers, and served by a small Staff.4. The organisation we suggest is as follows.The conduct of the operations would be in thehands of the Ccnmander-in-Chief, Home Forces, whose main Headquarters would be as at present inKheller liall/Twickenham.      He would have on his staff the following:-Chief of General Staff, Home Forces.Naval Staff Officer  (Rear Admiral).Air Staff Officer      (Air Vice Marshal).Chief Civil Staff Officer (Sir Findlater St&amp;war-t)5. The above staff would keep the Commander-in-ChiefHome Forces, fully informed of.the state andavailability of thu forpcs,1 and, conversely, they wouldconvey the rtsqxiireufijits wJf. the Coamand;er-in-chief tothe Admiralty^ tJtieuAiar Officers- ^Gc^raanoLing-in-Chief,and to the Civil Departments.     &quot;The Coui..ander-in-Chief,with the above and a few&apos;junior Staff Officers, would normally be located at .^jju Advanced Headquarters in theXiabinet War, Roc:.:, and would provide the necessaryll-aisofT .. links, withi rth-e&apos; Navy and the Royal       -Force,,and with the Civil Departments.6. The Cabinet War Room has  been chosen for the location of the Advanced Headquarters as being theplace best served by communications, and where all available information is centred.7. The Commander-in-Chief must, not only duringthe progress of active operations, but beforehand,be in a position to obtain immediate decisions on matters of policy where there is a conflict betweenmilitary necessity and constitutional rights or civil interests.     We recommend, therefore, that heshould be given direct access to the Prime Minister,to whom the advice of the Chiefs of Staff would beavailable.8. We are of the opinion that the above arrangements will provide the best means which can be rapidlydevised for ensuring the unified control of all measures for the defence of this country.      The Home

Defence Executive will continue as at present, for work as directed by the-Chairman.     V/e recommend,however9that the staff for operational control should be set upforthwith, so that it can study the whole problem, and beready to function efficiently.when the emergency arises.(Signed)    C.L.N.
