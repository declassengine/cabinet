THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to /   ?ensure the secrecy of this document.MOST secret.P.(40)219.June 25th, 1940. / Copy No.WAR CABINET.BOMBSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.The Air Ministry estimates quoted in W.P.(40)215were made in January 1940.     At that time no experience of intensive operations was yet available,  and arrangements werein consequence made to hold a reserve of bombs equivalent to six months&apos;  consumption at the estimated rates.On the 1st June guided by experience in Prance and flanders, the Air Ministry asked that the rate of -production ofboth the 250 lb. CP. bomb and the 40 lb. G. P. bomb should be accelerated as much as possible.On the 15thJune the Ministry of Aircraft Productionreported that additional capacity had been arranged whichwould at a very early date bring the total production of the250 lb. bomb to 20,000 a month, the level hitherto aimed atfor 1942, and the 40 lb. bomb to 40,000 a month.This was provisionally accepted, though it was ofcourse the intention to keep requirements under close review.It is improbable that the consumption of these bombs did infact exceed these rates even during the recent land battle.The Minister&apos;s new proposal to increase still further the production of these two bombs is, of course, welcomed.      Itwill enable reserves to be built up more rapidly and on alarger scale,x It is assumed that the increase in production can beobtained without any adverse effect on the production of other types of bomb.      It will also be necessary for the Ministry ofSupply to confirm that corresponding filling capacity can beprovided.A.H.M.S.Air Ministry^25th June,  1940.
