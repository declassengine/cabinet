THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 168It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.wng^j SECRET.1^.(40)201.m.ao C.0.S.(.40)444) ,TlTH JUNE. 1^40. COPY NO.^WAR CABINET0PLANS TO MEET A CERTAIN EVENTUALITY.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.On the 25th May, we submitted our views21 on Britishstrategy in the event of a collapse of French resistance andthe acceptance of peace terms by the French Government.    Weconcluded that ,:/e should still have a good chance of thinningthe war single-handed if we received full Pan-Americaneconomic and financial co-operation, but not otherwise;    andwe recommended various measures to improve the ability ofthis country to resist attack.2. Our recommendations,  however, stopped short at that point.They included, no measures designed to recover something fromthe wreck of France, nor did they&apos;cover the steps which mightbe necessary to obtain Pan-American co-operation.    The objectof this paper,  therefore, is to draw attention to the many problems which, in our opinion, ought to receive urgent consideration.    We recognise that many of the steps we nowsuggest may require delicate handling since they affect a loyalally fighting for her existence.    Nevertheless we feel that plans and preparations should be completed as far and as soonas they possibly can be.I.  DENIAL OF FRENCH RESOURCES TO THE GERMANS..   .3. There are, of course, many v/ays in which the situation might develop.    The French Government might collapse completelyand at once if the invading German armies reached Paris,    Theymight, however, withdraw to the south or west of France - or even to this country - in which case we should presumably have considerable help in carrying out the measures we outline below.Wo do not think we need take it for granted that thewhole French nation v/ill give in merely because the heads ofthe State have bowed before the storm.    Days, possibly weeks,of chaos and. semi-organised resistance may ensue.    It is duringthis period that we shall have our opportunity.x   W. P. (40)168.

4,      It is ixK).o^es&apos;xb^H to foresee what the situation, in france wou+d he,  subsequent to the collapse of french resistance-o    At the &quot;best, we might be able to obtain somecooperation either from a French Government still in being; or from individual French authorities, of which weshould of course take full advantage;    at the worst, theFrench authorities might refuse all co-operation and weshould be forced to take such measures as we could on ourini ciative,?he French,Navy,t5/i      We consider that any peace terms which Germany might.offer France would certainly include a peremptory demand forthe surrender of the French Fleeto    In fact, the germans would be most unlikely to agree to an armistice until theFrench Fleet had been surrendersdo    If the French Governmentmake up their minds to capitulate.;  it seems most unlikelythat they would agree to their Fleet joining ours0Alternatively,  if the French Fleet were to intern itself in a neutral country  such as America,, the Governmentof that country would be subjected, to such pressure fromthe French Government as could only result in the return of the Fleet to France^60      We could not afford, to see French ships and submarines added to the German and Italian Navies,    Itseems to us, therefore, that we have only two alternatives:-(a) to attempt to persuade as many french ships as possible to join our Htm. Fleet,We cannot expect such efforts to meet with much success;(b) &apos;if (a) fails, to press the French to sinkthe whole of their Fleets7o      Instructions must be issued to our Naval Commanders-in-Chief as to the measures to be taken to prevent any French ships which can be intercepted from givingthems&amp;lves up to the enomy-8.      It may also be possible to remove or destroyvaluable Naval equipment from French bases? such as Brestand Toulono    A plan should also be prepared fop blockingor destroying French naval bases which the Germans orItalians might use for operations against ourselves andfor securing the use of any French Colonial bases, suchas Casablanca and Dakar, which we may require for our ownforceso

French Shipping and Cables.9. Commander s-in-C hi ef will require instructions as to theaction to be taken in resx^ect of French shipping and cables.French Air Resources.10.       Many French pilots and mechanics&apos;, and even wholesquadrons, might be induced to come to this country.      In any event, preparations should be made to enable us to remove ordestroy French air resources and factories.The French Armyo11.       It is unlikely under the conditions envisaged thatwe could evacuate any complete French Army Units.     We might,however, induce certain French individuals and technicians tocome to this country and we might be able to extricate someguns, ammunition and material.General points on all three French Services.12. An inducement might be offered to all three FrenchServices in the form of British pay in return for service under the British flag.13.       In any event it is essential that the policy which we decide to adopt in respect of the three French services should be conmunicated as soon as ijossible to all our missions and Liaison Officers with the French so that they may know the.line they should take in dealing with French Commanders and units, if and when the situation arises.   .French economic and industrial resources.14.       It is believed that most of the French gold reserveshave already been sent to America.     We do not know whetherthis is also true of French negotiable securities, but weshould obviously do. all we can to prevent sources ofinternational credit from falling into German hands.     In thisconnection we understand that the Swiss Government also have considerable gold reserves and negotiable securities.     OnceFrench resistance collapses, it would be difficult to preventthese falling into German hands if they were not previouslytransferred to a safe place.15.       The removal or destruction of reserves of raw materials,rolling stock, machine tools, oil, and armaments stocks willbe required on an immense scale and at the last moment beforethe French lay down their arms.Intelligence016.       We cannot afford to allow secret technical apparatus(R.D.F. etc,,) to fall into the enemy hands.     Moreover, a great many documents of a highly secret nature are in Frenchpossession.     They are, for instance, in possession of our production figures, and papers defining our policy- in theMediterranean and the Middle Fast.      It is essential that weshould take steps to prevent this falling into enemy hands.17.       Up to the present we have found very great difficulty in getting information out of occupied territories.     Wemust make ample preparations to improve this state ofaffairs in France against the possibility of that country

being&apos; overrun.    Arrangements should also he put in handimmediately so that we shall he in a position to encouragesubversive activities and to carry out sabotage,French Colonial possessions..^5* The policy to be adopted in respect of french colonial possessions all over the world is an immenseproblem in itself.     As a first step we have arranged for an examination of the military aspects of this problem in conjunction with the Foreign Office,II.    PAN-AMERICAN CO-OPERATION.Following a French collapse, Germany would probablyat &quot;once devote her whole resources to an attack on thiscountry.        She might decide, however,  that it would pay her better to offer us peace terms, possibly under the threat of Italian intervention if that had not already occurred.        The more specious the terms, the moredifficult will it be for us to obtain the necessaryAmerican support with which to carry on the war.2q\ We v/ould remind the War Cabinet that we have already expressed the view in our previous report32 on this subject,that our ability to carry the war to a successful conclusion single-handed, depends on the? full economicand financial co-operation of the whole of the american continent.        It is therefore vital that we should beready, when the emergency arises,  to explain the positionto the American Government, In this approach, whichwe suggest oUght to be prepared in advance, we should makeit clear that -we have every intention of carrying on thewar with or v/ithout American co-operation, but we shouldmake it equally clear that if we obtain the full co-operationof the American continent   we see a good chance of a successful conclusion, whereas without that co-operation the hope of victory is remote.j.   It is clear, and has been confirmed in a recent tele-grarar from Lord Lothian, that the American public labour underthe delusion that the British Fleet would remain an effectiveelement in American defence even if its bases and supplies inthe United Kingdom were lost.   We should make it quite clearthat this is not so.    To assist him in his negotiations withthe American Government, we -suggest that our Ambassador in washington should be provided, with a short MilitaryAppreciation, which wo propose to prepare.21, I-t is important that we should be ready to explain to the American Government the role-which we expect of theAmerican peoples.      To this end, we s\iggest that a detailed examination should now be made with a view to determining our requirements of the American Continent.From the Military and Economic point of view our primaryrequirements would be:-25   W.P.(40) 168,j6   Washington Telegram No.932 of the 7th June.

(a) The stoppage at source of all supplies to enemy countries and territory in enemy occupation, and full voluntary co-operation in our contraband control against theremaining European neutrals.(h) The supply of munitions and raw materials^  ifnecessarjT- without payment.(c) Aircraft and flying boats in large numbers andat once.      These could only come from UnitedStates first line reso-urces.(d) Destroyers and light Naval craft.22i       Initiallyt it might he politically inexpedient to ask for organised Service personnel * &quot;but it might bepossible to obtain&apos; the Services of trained crews of theAmerican Naval and Air Forces,  on a Volunteer basisiThe Dominions.23, We consider it important that the dominions governments should be kept in close touch with the presentsituation as it develops and should be fully aware of thesituation in which we should be placed in the event of a french collapse. The opportunity should be taken topress them to increase their war effort to the maximum possible extent.       As we have already recommended^every possible measure should be directed to obtaining the active support of Eire.The Time Factor.24, Time is vital.      We have suggested in paragraph 3that there may be a period of days or weeks after thecapitulation of the French Government before the french resistance is completely broken.       We cannot rely on this.We may Vtrell be faced with these difficult problems at short notice, when quick decisions will be required.     We&apos;consider therefore that our action in respect of each ofthe above problems should be decided in advance,, and allpreparations should be made so that action can be- taken immediately the situation arises. . .III.      RE C recommendations.25. We have not attempted to enter into a detailed examination of all the measures which may have to beconsidered in the event of French collapse, nor have wein view of the restricted circulation of this paper,yet brought the Service Departments into full consultation.Our object is to draw attention to the nature of theva-fious problems&apos; which in our view require immediate consideration \)j the Departments responsible for action.26. We recommend action as follows:-x   W,P.(40) 168, paragraph 23 (viii).

(a) That the responsibility for co-ordinating allthe measures recommended in this paper should be vested in one Ministered   under his supervision immediate examination ofthe following problems should be put inhand.:-&quot;(i) Measures for preventing, as far aspossible, French Naval, Military andAir equipment from falling into enemyhandsP  aid for encouraging any elementswe can to join our own foroeso    Thepolicy agreed upon should be communi-cated to all British Missions andLiaison Officers so that they may know the lino of action to take if thesituation arises..    (paras0 9-12 )0(ii) Measures which should be taken in respectof French shipping and cableso(para 9)*      .(,iii) Measures to prevent French and Swiss gold and. negotiable , securities falling intoenemy hands0    (.paraa 14) oMeasures to -prevent secret equipment and documents falling into enemy handso Ageneral list of these is being prepared,Vparac 13 )cMeasures to organise intelligence in french territory..,    (paras 17)o\;vt) Measures to enable us to encouragesubversive activities and promotesabotage in French territory,,.    (para. 17)(,vii) Measures to deny French economic andindustrial resources to Germany and. Italyo    (para. 15)u(viii) Policy in respect of French Oolonialpossessions and mandated territories^(parao 18 )0b) We should settle now the line which we shouldtake with the United States of America,pointing out bluntly the paramount necessityof the co-operation of the whole of theAmerican Continent if we are to carry the war to a successful conclusion and inviting themto face squarely the Military situation inwhich they themselves will be placed if we aredefeated.,:     (paras 0 19-22.);,fi   Nate.&apos;Since drafting this report we have discussed certain aspects with the Chancellor cf the Duchy who has informed us that he has already taken a number of preliminary steps on the lines of the action takenin Holland and. Belgiunu

(o) The Dominion Governments should be informed of the broad lines of our policy in theevent of a French collapse and should be pressed to increase their war effort to themaximum possible extent. (para 14).27. In anticipation of the approval of the WarCabinet to the abovo recommendations, we have alreadyset on foot an examination of the problems presented in paragraph 26(a)(v), (vi) and (viii), and we are pre-paring an appreciation to assist Lord Lothian in washington (vide para. 20 above).(Signed)    C.L.N.
