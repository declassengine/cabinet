(40) 191(Also P.0TgT*(40) 47) .4TH JUNE. 1940.WAR CABINET.GERMAN OIL SUPPLIES.Fourth Report of Lord Hankey&apos;s Committee on PreventingOil ,from reaching Germany-covering the Third Rgport^ofthe Committee on the German Oil Position.I. Introduction.1.        The war has reached a stage when, if we are correctlyinformed, fresh decisions on p61icy may have to be taken,including no doubt the selection Of targets as objectives forour Bomber Forces.   German oil installations have alwaysoccupied a high place among these objectives, andconsequently we have thought the moment opportune to review the German oil position in the light of recent developments.At the suggestion of the Air Staff, the statistical position has been reviewed once more by Mr. Geoffrey lloyd Committeewhose Report is attached as an Appendix.COPY NO.II.       Operations against German Oil Stocks.2.        If, by operations against German oil stocks,- againstthe production of oil in Germany and against the import of oil into Germany, we can do sufficiently serious damage,the war is won.   No refinements of statistical estimates candispose of this simple proposition.    In 1918, when the Germanoil reserves were reduced to one million tons, the shortagereached a point at which it became a source of serious embarrassment to the military authorities, and the supply of petrol and lubricants for military purposes gave rise togreat anxiety.   We cannot assume that in the present war amillion tons or thereabouts would be the German dying-outfigure.   None the less, it is helpful to have this figure inmind as a rough guide to our objective.   Even a largereserve of oil may, from the point of view of the german war machine, be badly distributed and its concentration atthe required points vrould be more difficult if, as is to be hoped, we shall have succeeded in severly dislocating their transport arrangements, especially by rail and river.

-cy       It is also Important to observe, as the representativeof the Air Ministry who attended our deliberations    has pointedout to uSj that oil targets are, from the Royal Air Forcepoint of view, highly desirable objectives, particularlybecause they are vulnerable to air attack because attack upon, them gives rise to very large secondary effects by wayof fire and explosions.    The majority of the chief oil plants In Germany are remote from centres of civil population.Therefore attack upon oil plants is likely to cause fewercasualties among civilians than other targets.    There is some evidence that recent raids on. the oil tanks at Hamburgdemoralised the civilian population and slowed downindustrial output.4. The following table which has been compiled byMr. Geoffrey Lloyd&quot;s Committee on the basis of the best available expert advice sets out the German oil prospectsas at the 1st September next, assuming that the Allies take no further action during the next three monts to reducesupplies to the enemy.    Though there Is no finalityabout these figures and as has been emphasised by theCommittee in previous reports, the figures are only veryapproximate, yet they demonstrate sufficiently clearly therelative importance cf the sotirces from which Germanyobtains her supplies.    The table gives the revised estimatesas compared with the committee report dated 18th March.TABLE lbResources.

5. The apparent improvement in Germany1 s position&apos;onthe 1st September, 1940, is duo to the addition of the lootestimated to have been acquired in Norway, Denmark, Holland,Belgium and northern Prance.    It is possible that this estimate is too high and that more damage was in fact done to the reserve oil tanks in these countries than has been allowed for.6. Two further facts should be mentioned here:-(a) Italy holds stocks of oil estimated, at 2g million tons.    Jit is in theory possible that, if andwhen Signor Mussolini carries out his threat to enter the war0 Germany may draw&apos; uponItalian stocks.    Italy must, however, havebuilt up these stocks on the basis of her ownwartime requirements and we do not think thatshe will in practice have much to spare for germany.    She might, indeed- have less to spare as a belligerent than as a &quot;non-belligerent5&apos;&apos;.    In either case, it is for theAllies to consider how Italian stocks maybe diminishedo(c) France has large supplies of oil. most of whichare o:.i or near the coast,    Plans to destroy orremove these, if uncovered by the course ofmilitary operations, should be in readiness.7. It will be seen from the table above that there are three sources from which Germany will obtain seven-eigths of hertotal supply:    viz. Stocks, Domestic Production and Importsfrom Roumania.    We will consider these in turn.8- Stocks.,   Of the three,  stocks are clearly the mostimportant to attack,  if the object is to create the maximumimmediate effect, since they are already in being in Germany,while production and imports are only potential.9. Of the oil stocks in Germany less than half are underground and heavily protected and. will be very difficult to damage.    The rest are, however, above ground and vulnerable.We urge that vigorous action should be taken against them atthe earliest possible moment,I0,       Production.    The most vulnerable and also the largestelement in German oil production is the synthetic oil plants,the largest of which are the Eergius Hydrogenation plants.Particulars of all synthetic oil plants are already available and their positions logged.    We urge that action against theprincipal plants, and not as hitherto only against.the minorones, should be undertaken at once.11.       In selecting oil targets, a high priority should alsobe given to plants producing lubricating oil, which is a specially weak point in German oil economy.

III.     Roumanian Supplies.12.       V;a also urge the War cabinet to do everything possible to reduce the amount of oil reaching Gor.vc.nyfrom Roumania.    It is true that up to the present time theamount has been relatively small, as shown by the folliswingfigures: -TABLE II.Oil received by Germany from Roumaniasince September, 19^9..,19^9. Tons.September ....... ........... 0.. ......4 . &apos;/l*000October ............................. 8^,500Noveraber ____......................... 94,700December ................. .-. ,........68,900L940..January............................g,600February ^o nonMarch............................ -April....................&apos; 7o,000+May (estimated)  ----.................... 100,000Total. 601,200Actual figure for the first half ofMay was 42,000 tons.15.       We are, however, on the eve of a serious change forthe worse.    Germany has succeeded in striking terror into thehearts of the Balkan peoples.    Large number of Germans havepenetrated on one pretext or another into all the DanubianStates, where they form a series of formidable &quot;FifthColumns&quot;.    The Roumanian Government, acting under german pressure, has taken measures to compel the friendly oil companies to hand over, in payment of royalties, oil whichwill be used to discharge the Roumanian Governments agreement that Germany shall receive an average of 130,000 tons of oila month.   Further exactions of the same kind will be demandedvery soon.   We are using such influence as we have with the oil Companies to avoid compliance and interpose.delay, butthere are limits to their power to co-operate with us inthis way.14.       In any event, there are now large stocks of oil in roumania itself, which are rapidly accumulating as a result ofthe closure.of the Mediterranean to British shipping and thefailure of the French to lift sufficient quantities in thepast.    The only method at present proposed for deprivingGermany of these stocks is to keep a few tankers at Roumanianports for the purpose of lifting as much oil as possible inthe event of the Mediterranean being completely closed.

15.       In addition, owing to the extent and imminence of theGerman threat to advance down the Danube in force, we andghe French have been obliged to start withdrawing from the danube the tugs, motor vessels and barges we had purchasedor chartered in order to deprive the Germans of their use.They are no longer available as potential blockships, nor to counter the threatened German occupation of the river.    Thelight armaments that were sent to the Danube to equip themfor this purpose were discovered by the Gestapo, and denouncedto the Roumanian Government, who could hardly do less thaninsist on their being handed over to their keeping.16.       Of all our plans the only one which still remains infull operation is the hiring of river pilots so as to divertthem from German vessels.    This has created considerablechaos and delay at the Iron Gates.    Even that scheme, however,is threatened and, without some outside stimulus, is liableto peter out.    Such a stimulus, we are informed, ?rould beprovided by the mining of theupper reaches of the Danube,even though the mines never passed beyond German controlledwaters, for the pilots have been encouraged to a proper dreadof floating mines.17.       In short, for one reason or another most of the Alliedplans for diverting oil from Germany by more or less legitimatecommercial means have failed, and it is clear that the time has come to have recourse to other more drastic and effective measures.18.       We urge, therefore,  the early adoption of the R.M.scheme for the Danube, or if it proves impracticable, anyother still feasible project which would have the effect,even for a time, of limiting the traffic in oil and other commodities up the Danube.    In addition, bombing operations against the oil receiving depots at Regerisburg, Passau,Vienna and Bratislava and against the railway bridge overthe Danube at Vienna might produce a resounding effectamong the Danubian States, with repercussions In Germanyitself.    The operation, we understand, would be greatly facilitated if French aerodromes were used.   We urgeadoption of this proposal at an early date,       .i19.       Unfortunately, there is little prospect not&quot;., under theGerman reign of terror, that the Roumanian Government willever have the courage to carry out the destruction of theRoumanian oil fields, or admit the British Field company of Royal Engineers now on board a ship in the sea of marmora with a view to its rapid transport to the Roumanianoil fields to assist in the demolitions.    Before, however,the idea of destroying the Roumanian oil wells, even withoutthe concurrence of the Roumanian Government, is finallyabandoned, we. urge that the cost of such abandonment shouldbe coldly calculated.    This cost, it may be, would amount tothe difference between victory and defeat,,20.       In the past, major operations involving less orthodoxmethods have been ruled out on the grounds that the prospects of success were not sufficiently promising to justify theshock that wotild result to our relations with Danubian States.In present circumstances, however, these arguments have lostmuch of their validity.   We are fighting for our existence andmust now take risks and use methods formerly rejected.    Wehave more to gain from a success and less to lose from a failure.

IV.;      Summary of Recommendations.21.       We recommend:-(a) That vigorous action should be taken against german oil targets at the earliest possible moment, and that a high priority should begiven to attacks on plants producinglubricating oil,(b) That everything possible should be done to -reduce the amount of oil reaching germany from Roumania.    In particular, we urge theearly adoption of the R.M. Scheme for the danube.(c) That consideration should be given to the carrying out of bombing operations at anearly date against the oil receivingdepots at Regensburg, Passau, Viennaand Bratislava and against the railway bridge over the Danube at Vienna.(d) That consideration should be given once more to any less orthodox projects thatmay still be practicable for blockingthe Danube or obstructing traffic thereon..Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,

If the assessment made in the previous report had &quot;been! fulfilled, the sjtock position at the ist May would have been1,400,000,jtonsj,   As,, however, the estimates were worked out on a monthly basis any error over a period of eight months may havea considerable effect on the stock position.     on the supply side-*that is production and imports,  reliable information has shownthat the error is very moderate except perhaps as regards illicitimports for Italy,     on the side of consumption it is much more-difficult to check the original estimates.     If these contained,so small an overall error as 60,000 tons a month, the effect would bo to maice the stock position at 1st May approximately2 million tons.     As recent non-statistical evidence suggeststhat during April German storage capacity was at least moderatelyfull - it seems now to be unwise to take a lower figure than- million tons as stocks at 1st MayoDomestic Production.    Estimated at 3,000,000 tons.    it is nowproposed to increase the figure of 3,000,000 tons under this headto &apos;3,350,000 tons as a result of a further detailed examinationmade in the Petroleum Department.    The difference is accountedfor by raising the allowance for alcohol and benzole used as adiluent for oil.    An. allowance had already been made for theuse of this auxiliary in the original estimates and though&apos;itIs not strictly a petroleum product, it is convenient to bring it into account under this head, as an alternative to        jallowing for a further reduction of civil consumption,,Imports and gontrabando    previous estimate - l? 680,, 000 tons.This assumed a&quot; minimum of 1,100,000 tons from Roumania,350,000 tons Russian, ssthoniah etc, and 230,000 tons fromcontraband avasione      The figures for the first eight months .imports from Roumania    amounted to approximately 500,000 tons.If Q-ermany is to secure the minimum she will have to importfrom Roumania an average of.150,000 tons a month in each ofthe next four months. May to August,,     subject to the unforeseen,it/ seems reasonable to adhere to the minimum figure in theExport,, more especially as in the first half of May the importfrom Roumania has been only about 42,,000 tons0Russia.    There appears no reason to change the figure of350,000 tons for imports from Russia,.   Poland., etco    Up tothe end of April the total, imports were only 139,000 tons *Contraband Qontrol.

IllWavy, The Admiralty do not find it necessary&quot;any&quot;&apos;change in their figures.to makeAir Force;.      The Air Ministry have reduced their estimateflTr^the&quot;first 6 months by 175?000 tons and have increased their estimate for the second six months by 175,000 tonsleaving the figure unchanged,,Civil Consumption,      The Report estimate was 3i milliontonsTThough this figure is extremely difficult toassesss no change is proposed in view of the conservativefigures used in estimating supplies.3e Account must be taken of the stocks taken byGermany in Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium which, onthe data available, may be estimated at a maximum of800,000 tons.      A moderate ration should be allowed tocarry on essential industry and transport in thesecountries during the next three months, this allowancebeing estimated at about 60,000 tons a month, leavingapproximately 600,000 tons as a net addition to Germany&apos;resources during the first year of war.      On the other side should be set the loss of stocks and productive capacity in Germany as a result of recent Air Force action.      Noestimates are yet available of the damage d.one, but it may be aconsiderable figure,  as the  storage capacity in the places attacked, amounted to over l4: million tons, whilethe productive capacity of the installations which  /ere the object of Air Force attention amounts to about500,,0C0 tons a year,.In adjusting in paragraph 2 above the stockigure as at 1st May we suggested, an allowance of some60^000 tons a month to cover possible error and to bringthe statistical picture into line with other evidence.As it is now probable that the consumption estimates forthe coming, four months are likely to err in the opposite direction,  it appears reasonable to suppose that thesemargins w:.1 be re absorbed.The estimated stock position,        ^,  is shown in the table below,to calculate the stock position atintervening months the appropriate fraction of the i.j.80,000tons possible error in the first eight months should bereabsorbed.,at the 1st September, 1940,In using this table5.
