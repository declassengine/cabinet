THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. % 6 0It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.S g C R g Ti24TH JUNF,T 194dj&apos; COPY NO.,WAR CABINET.ECONOMIC AID PROM THE NEW WORLD;.Memorandum ,by the Chancellor of the ExchequeriI agree generally with the conclusions in the memoranda by the Minister without Portfolio on economic aid from the New World to the Old (Papers Nos. W.P. (40)209 andW,P.(40) 214), and with those of his separate paper on theeconomic consequences of a collapse of French resistance(Paper No. W.P.(G.)(40) 165).The point which I should like to emphasise particularlyis the vital importance of the grant of credits by theUnited States referred to in paragraph 18 of Paper No.W.P.(40)209 and in paragraph 3 of Paper No. W.P.(40) 214*So far as the most conjectural estimate of the adverse balance of payments between the sterling area and the UnitedStates and Canada during the second year of war can be formedit is clear that out available resources are likely to beconsumed at all too rapid a rate.     The more quickly the new world     can come to our aid, the more this estimated adverse balance must increase.     The extent to which Canada can give us credit is limited, and our hope of being able to pay for supplies from the new world through the remainder of 1940and 1941 depends on the grant of credits by the,United States,covering if possible purchases from Canada and South america as well as purchases from the United States itself.     Thequestion how and when this matter should be raised with theUnited States Government is one of the greatest importance.Until we are sure of all the.credit we need, we must,as the Minister without Portfolio points out, resort to every possible stratagem to reduce the pace at which we draw onour assets,.     The fact that port facilities rather thanshipping are now the bottle-neck should (as I indicated inmy memorandum of 6th June (Paper No. E.P.(M)(40) 45) enable us to find shipping to obtain as much wheat as possible from australia, where it costs us nothing in dollars and in fact,in the long run, costs us nothing at all, since what we pay for the Australian wheat serves to reduce Australia&apos;s war debt to us - and one may assume that after the war we shouldneither be able nor wish to collect this war debt in cash.(Initialled). K.W.Treasury Chambers. S.W*1*24TH JUNE, 194Q.
