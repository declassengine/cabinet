The object of our report, which isbased on the general strategy which we have already recommended^is to consider what our policy should be in regard to theFrench uolomal Empire  aid mandated territories in thesecircumstances.2. Whatever the German terms may be,  we must assume thatthey will include the immediate cessation of hostilities by all french forces and the use of any French bases or territory by german or Italian forces for operations against ourselves.    Inaddition, the German terms may demand that the economic resourcesof France and her overseas possessions shall &quot;be placed at thedisposal of,Germany and Italy03. In these circumstances there are three possiblesituations with which we may be confronted in dealing with french overseas possessions:-(a) at the best, we may be able to induce local french authorities to continue the war independently; i.e.,to deny their territory and resources to the enemy,and to.permit us to make any use of these ourselves;(d) at the worst, local French authorities may adopt an attitude of complete acquiescence in the Germanterms;    i*e., full co-operation with any german demands and&quot;non-co-operation with ourselves.      Inthis case,  any measures which we might take might be resisted by force;(o) alternatively, jocal French authorities may adopt a middle course, i,6.,  they will actively resistneither side.36   W.P.

I nro ortance of, the: branch Empire- la - re latiqa..to&quot;^r/General &apos;Sffrate/ry4, After the collapse of Prance, our ability -bo defeatGermany will depend upon our being able to control at sourceEurope&apos;s essential external supplies, including supplies of tropical and colonial produce and non-ferrous metals, and upon the retention of hey strategic positions from which wecan exert what will virtually be a blockade of the whole ofEurope.5. Our requirements in respect of French overseas possesions will be:--(a) to control the economic products of the French Empireat source and prevent them reaching countries outside the British and American economic orbit.This would, be of great importance for, if suchtrade continued., the whole scheme for contact atsource might collapse;(b) to make such use of French overseas bases as we may require ourse1ves, e.g. 0asab1anca ;(c) to deny naval and air bases to Germany and Italy,e.g\, Dakar, Syria, Madagascar, from which theycould dispute our control of sea communications^(d) to prevent our enemies from making use of french territory for military operations or subversive activities against our own possessions.The political importance of avoiding any disturbancein the status quo in the Far East&apos;will be a governing factor in any measures which can he taken in regard to french in do-China.,64 As we have already pointed out in paragraph 3 aboveTthere are three possible situations with which we may be confronted, varying from full and willing co-operation onthe part of -local French authorities to complete non-co-operation and even active resistance,      Much will probably depend uponthe personality of the local Governor and his officials, andthe pressure to which they might be exposed if they assisted us.We can make no as sumption in advance as to the attitude weshould encounter in the French overseas possessions generally;and we have,  therefore, grouped the French possessions under three main headings In examining what our policy should be:-(a) territories whose sea communications will be underenemy control;-(b) territories whose sea communications will be under our own control;(c) other territories.,

8. The most we can hope to do will he to interrupt internalcoOTiunioations in North Africa by sabotage and subversive activities among the tribes, exploiting to the full Moslimreligious fanaticism.     In doing this we are unlikely to be assisted by the higher French authorities, who will probablybe cowed by the enemy at their gates;   but it might be possibleto obtain some assistance from individual French officers,especially in the more remote districts.TERRITORIES WHOSE SEA COMMUNICATIONS WILL be under OUR OWN CONTROL99 Before reviewing the various French possessions whosesea communications will be under our own control, we would refer generally to the basic question of whether we should attempt to occupy any of these territories with our own forces.As we see the problem, the main factors are as follows(a) those bases which would be of most value either to ourselves or to the enemy are already defended.If local French authorities can be induced, to denythese bases to the enemy, they will probably be ableto do so wi&quot;.tl*,out assistance from us, except for supplies:(b) if the local French forces resisted an attempt by ourown forces to occupy these bases, we should be facedwith opposed combined operations for which it is unlikely we should have the resources:(c) if, as is more likely, local French authoritiesadopted an apathetic attitude and decided not to resist an occupation either by ourselves or by theenemy, we should have the alternative of (i)occupation by our own forces, or (ii) preventing anenemy occupation by the action of our naval forces.(d) in any case, the economic products of these territories would be largely denied to the enemy by our controlof sea communications.On balance, we feel that, with our very limited resources,we should not attempt to occupy these territories.Morocco10.       Gibraltar may become untenable as a naval base, andas an alternative it would be desirable to use Casablanca.The French should, therefore, be pressed to concentrate the remnants of their A.A.  defences and fighter aircraft in this   .area.   We should not however contemplate using it as a baseexcept with French agreementc    There would be no questionof landing a force to occupy the base. -TERRITORIES WHOSE SEA COMMUNTnATTnwg wt- t rtpUNDER ENEMY CONTROL---        W--^Worth Africa7.

West Africa411. French territory in West Africa consists of theFederation of French West Africa, French equaltorial africa and the ex-German Mandates of Togolarid and theCameroonsiThe tropical products of these territoris areof particular importanoe to our enemies and it isessential that we should control them at the source.In addition,  the particular problem of Senegal is discussedbelow.12. Senegal is separated from French Morocco bysome 900 miles of desert which is of little economic importance.     The enemy might establish refuelling &quot;bases in the desert country for air attack on Freetown orDakar (if the latter were in our occupation);    but thereis nothing we could do to prevent this.13. Dakar is a well equipped base and it would be essential to prevent its use by enemy forces.     We shouldnot require to use it ourselves, as we already have a &quot;baseavailable at Freetown.      Our naval forces operating fromFreetown should he capable of preventing the enemy from using Dakar or obtaining supplies from Senegal.Madagascar.,14. Madagascar is of some importance as a  source of tropical produce,, and would be useful as a base for enemy raiders in the Indian Ocean and Gape of Good Hopearea.      In view of the large area to be covered in the island, we do not consider&apos;&quot;that occupation would be practicable.        Failing the co-operation of the localBlench authorities, we should, have to rely upon our naval forces to prevent the use of the island by enemy raiders.We should, of course, be able to exert some pressureif necessary by cutting off imports into the island.India.15. The strategic importance of France&apos;s possessionsin India is negligible except possibly in the event ofwar with Japan, when they might he used, for the conveyance of military information by wireless and other means tothe enemy.     . No action need be taken unless foundnecessary, when any action required can be taken by theGovernment of India.The Americas.16. In the Americas, the French possess St. Pierreand Miquelon off the coast of Newfoundland; Martiniqueand Guadeloupe in the West Indies;    and French Guiana.

17* It is most unlikely that any military use ofthese possessions would he made &quot;by the Italians or Germans.It is considered that their continued neutrality could he safely left to the operation of the Monroe doctrine;a Contention which is perhaps confirmed by a recentresolution of the United States Congress that the United&apos;.States of America would not tolerate the transfer ofany colonial possessions in America of a European powerto any non-A-merican power.18, The present French commitment in Aruba would haveto he assumed by the Canadians, ourselves, or by theUnited States of America.OTHER TERRITORIES.French Somaliland.19. Italian occupation of French Somaliland willprobably he rapidly carried out from Abyssinia - if not already carried out before the French collapse.     It wouldgive the Italians a base at Djibouti (connected by railwith Addis Abada) only 150 miles from Aden.      Italianactivities would, however, be a wasting asset as their forces could not be reinforced except by air so long aswe hold our position on the Canal.     In any event ourposition in the Red Sea would not be materially effectedand the threat -would not bo serious enough to -warrant anyspecial action. Syria.30. Syria and Lebanon arc Republic under FrenchJVIaadate.     The occupation of these territories by enemy forces would have most serious strategio consequences since i t would cut our land communications with Turkey andwould immediately threaten the whole of our interests inthe Middle East.     Moreover,  the capture of Beirut withits oil supplies would provide the enemy with a valuablebase in the Eastern Mediterranean.21. We consider that it would be important to our whole position in the Middle East to prevent the enemyfrom establishing themselves in Syria. This might beachieved in the following ways:-(a) Firstly, the local French forces, whichare considerable, might decide to resist^Every effort should be made to induce them to do so.(b) Secondly, Turkey as an active ally,  mightrestrain the Italians from an actualattack or might occupy Syria and resist the attack. It does  not at presentseem likely, however,  that Turkey willdeclare herself openly as a belligerent,

(c) If (a) and (b) fail we should have to rely upon theFleet to prevent an actual occupation.22.       We do not consider that Turkey should be encouraged totake over the Mandate, since this would probably have serious repercussions&apos; in the Arab world - particularly in Iraq andSaudi Arabia *- and would be opposed by the Syrians themselves.IfocLo-China and Oceania23.       The principal French possessions in the Far East areIndo-China (population S3 millions).. New Caledonia, the loyalty Islands (to the north-east of Australia), the Society,Marquesas and numerous other islands in the Pacific.    inaddition, the Anglo-French condominium of the New Hebrideslies to the north of New Caledonia.24.       The strategic importance of these possessions, apartfrom their use as raider bases, depends on the attitude of japan.     With a defeated France, they would be a temptingbait for the Japanese.     From this point of view, the mostimportant  is Indo-china.&apos;. j A Japanese occupation of Indo-China would enable her to control Siam;   would bring a japanese base at Saigon within 640 sea miles of Singapore,and would provide air bases for operations against Malaya(less than 300 miles from Indo-China to Malaya at the nearest point).     Indo-China is of economio importance as a source of tropical products and as a re-export base fornon-ferrous metals from South China.     The problem of controlling the trade from Indo-China will present considerabledifficulty.      Some control could be exercised throughChiang Kai Shek, who is dependent to some extent on importsthrough Burma; and also by denial of imports to Indo-Chinaherself.25.       New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands in japanese occupation would be a serious threat to Australian and NewZealand trade.      The other islands in the Pacific are ofnegligible strategic value except possibly to provide bases for Japanese light craft.26.       It is obviously most desirable to maintain the statusquq in the Pacific.     Any attempt by us to alter it by theoccupation of one of the French possessions would lead to immediate difficulties with Japan.27. The best course would be to induce the United states to announce that she would not tolerate any change in the,.status quo in the Far East and the Pacific.   At thesame time we should attempt to persuade the local Frenchadministrations to continue their trade with us and to denyany facilities to enemy raiders if the latter should try tomake use of them.

OOjIJ?J^SJEOHS.28.       It is clear that the problem with which we shall be faced, in dealing with the French Colonial Empire is a difficult one.     Much will depend upon the attitude whichthe local administrations adopt.     Broadly, our conclusions are as follows:-(a) There can be no question of taking over theFrench possessions ourselves.      Our policy should aim at controlling colonial produce atsource and denying the use of French colonialbases to our enemies;(b) We shall be unable to achieve this aim in respectof French North Africa and French Somaliland,and we shall be faced with a difficult and dangerous problem in Syria unless the french authorities co-operate with us.;(c) Elsewhere, it should be possible, if the UnitedStates of America co-operate, to achieve our object without the necessity of occupying any French territory,(d) No action should be taken to disturb the status quo in the Far East and the Pacific and weshould enlist the assistance of the UnitedStates of America,&apos; to preserve it,29.       These conclusions point clearly to the vital necessityof maintaining a French Government in beingoRECOMMENDATIONS.30.       We recommend that:-(a) We should, at the appropriate moment, endeavourto induce the French Government to despatch asecret message.to their local authoritiesoverseas urging them in advance to continue toco-operate with British forces, regardless ofany possible terms to which the Government mightbe compelled to agree under duress.(b) The Foreign Office have already informed theprincipal British Consular representatives in french territories of our policy and plans inrespect of a possible French collapse.     Withthis as a background, and in addition to any communication made by the French Government inaccordance with (a) above, we should ourselvesimmediately the French Government make terms with the enemy, address a message to the localadministrations in all French Colonial and mandated territories, through our own local representatives (if possible in association with the Dutch, Belgian, Norwegian, Polish and united States Governments) in the following sense:

We recognise that the French Governmenthas been compelled to capitulate underduress and against the will of the french people.     We ourselves intend to continuethe war.     France herself is in enemy occupation, but not her overseas possessions.We shall therefore do all in our power toassist these territories to defend themselves under the flag of France againstthe enemy.     We count upon their continued co-operation.(c) We should do all in our power to nersuadeTurkey to declare herself a belligerent0Possibly the offer of the Dodecanese might help.(d) The Ministry of Economic Warfare should prepare plans for exerting economic pressure on those territories which refuse to co-operate, andthat our own local representatives should beempowered to hold out this threat where necessary.(e) We should try to induce the United States ofAmerica to announce that any attempt to change the status quo in the Far East or the pacific will not be tolerated.(f) We should press the French to concentrate the remnants of their anti-aircraft and fighterdefences in North Africa at Casablanca, sothat we can use it as long as possible as a naval base if Gibraltar becomes unusable.(Signed)      G.L.N.
