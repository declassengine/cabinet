General Review.NAVAL SITUATION.THE evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force and the Allied troops from Dunkirk has been completed and the naval forces employed redisposed.There has been an increase of U-boat activity against merchant shipping.Evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force.2. The evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force and Allied troops fromthe port of Dunkirk and neighbouring beaches was continued until the 4th Juneby which date 224,318 British and 111,172 Allied troops a grand total of335,490 had been safely landed in England. A detailed statement is given inAppendix I and a graph showing the rate of evacuation is attached.Weather conditions were favourable during most of the period, mistinterfering with German bombing operations on the 30th May and the 3rd and4th June.  Heavy surf on the 31st retarded embarkation from the beaches.Ships engaged in the operation were heavily attacked by German bombersduring daylight hours, - and at night M.T.Bs. (apparently based on Ymuidenand Helder) were used to harass them. In addition, the work was increasinglyhampered by shell fire from batteries erected to the westward of Dunkirk. Patrolsby corvettes, trawlers and Fleet Air Arm aircraft were carried out throughoutthe period of the evacuation to protect the ships engaged in the operation.3.   Particulars of naval vessels damaged or sunk in the course of theevacuation are contained in Appendix II.The British losses were as follows : DestroyersCorvette ...GunboatYachts   ...Mine-sweepers ...TrawlersDrifters......Special service vesselsDan-laying vesselTug      ......TotalsSunk.61248541132Damaged.2119334The French lost 2 leaders and 5 destroyers sunk.A chronological narrative of events in connection with the evacuation isgiven below.May 30.4. A ground mist, or possibly smoke which was hanging over the Dunkirkarea from the various burning buildings, favoured embarkation. Food and waterwere landed, and about 25 destroyers entered Dunkirk in rotation, effecting amuch higher clearance than that from the beaches where there was a shortageof small craft and naval personnel.The British naval losses on this day were included in last week&apos;s resume.The French losses were as follows: One destroyer torpedoed by M.T.Bs.,1 destroyer and 2 small torpedo boats set on fire, 4 small transports and 2 patrolboats sunk, and 1 destroyer, 1 gunboat and 1 transport damaged.The approaches to the Mole at Dunkirk were subject to heavy and continuousshell fire on the evening of the 30th.May 31.5. British and Allied troops were given equal opportunities of evacuation-During the forenoon embarkation on the beaches was hampered by surf. Dunkirkwas heavily shelled, and ships in harbour, as also were ships approaching, andthere were a number of air raids. Several of H.M. ships reported attacks by enemy M.T.Bs. during the night of the 31st-lst. The following casualtiesoccurred : H.M.S. Kellett, damaged by bombing, H.M. Destroyers Malcolm and
Sharpshooter were in collision. H.M. ships Harvester, Icarus, Scimitar, Leda,Whitehall and Impulsive were slightly damaged either when going alongside orby hitting sunken wrecks.June 1.6. In view of the danger from mines, gunfire and bombs it was decided to confine the embarkation to Dunkirk and the beach immediately to the eastward.Bombing began at 0350, and over 100 bombers were over the Dunkirk area at0530 and 1754, causing many casualties. Vice-Admiral Dover reported that allchannels to Dunkirk were under heavy barrage fire from coastal batteries, and requested permission to withdraw all forces till daylight. However, orders weregiven to continue evacuation until 0700 on the 2nd, using destroyers only. LordGort arrived at Dover at 0500 on the 1st.The destroyers Basilisk, Havant and Keith were sunk; and Ivanhoe,Vivacious, Venomous, Worcester, Express and Vimy were damaged. Two mine-sweepers, 1 corvette, 3 trawlers, 2 transports and 1 yacht were sunk.One out of 3 enemy M.T.B&apos;s. was bombed and sunk by F.A.A. aircraft atmidnight east of Zeebrugge. The F.A.A. also attacked moles and catamaransat Nieuport. One Messerschmitt was shot down, but 2 Skuas were also brought down and 1 disabled on landing. The FA.A. also attacked enemy troop concentrations.June 2.7.   The evacuation of the B.E.F. was practically completed by 2300 on the 2nd.During the final stages of the operation, 2 trawlers and 1 mine recoverydrifter were sunk, and 2 hospital carriers and 2 A/S trawlers damaged.June 3.8. British vessels embarked troops from the East Pier. Other Britishand French vessels worked from the West Pier of the outer port, and small craft used the inner harbour and ferried troops to vessels waiting outside.Thick fog off Dover delayed the arrival of the ships but also prevented enemy aircraft activity.Two more blockships were sunk in the main channel in Dunkirk and a thirdwas sunk by a magnetic mine.No casualties to ELM. Ships occurred.The evacuation of the rearguard of about 30,000 Allied troops proceededduring the night of the 3rd-4th,Admiral Nord arrived at Dover in a M.T.B.June 4.9. Evacuation ended at 1030 on the 4th, and the fleet of rescue ships wasdispersed.Two more blockships were sunk at Dunkirk, it is believed successfully.Norway.10. Since the capture of Narvik reported in last week&apos;s resume, there hasbeen but little naval news reported from the Narvik area.It was reported on the 29th May that mines were suspected in TjelsundetFjord, which connects Vest Fjord and Vaagsf jord, and it was consequently closed.Two mines were swept about 6^ miles north of the southern end of the fjord, andLL sweeps have exploded two mines near Narvik.H.M.S. Vindictive arrived Scapa from Narvik during the night 31st-lst, with1,000 troops on board. It is estimated that export of iron ore in appreciablequantities from Narvik cannot take place for 12 months owing to the destructionof all quays and electric power and damage to railway and obstructions in harbour.Bodo, which was severely damaged by enemy aircraft, was successfullyevacuated by our troops on the night of the 31st May.Home Waters.11.   On the 30th May H.M. Boom Defence vessel Cambria was mined and sunk at Spithead.   It is understood that she was outside the swept channel.[21380] 3
On the 1st June the British S.S. Astronomer was sunk North of KinnairdHead after three explosions. She was bound for Scapa with a cargo of buoys andmooring material. The next evening a suspected line of mines nearer KinnairdHead was reported, and a dangerous area was declared. A searching sweep hasbeen carried out, so far without result, and it is considered possible that thesuspected line of mines may have been buoys coming up from Astronomers cargo,a large number of all sizes having been found.On the 2nd June the Dutch Cruisers Sumatra and Heemskuck left milford haven for Halifax with H.R.H. Princess Juliana and her children on board.Four armed merchant cruisers have been allocated for patrol off the coast of Ireland against possible invasion.At 1130 the 5th June, two unknown ships were sighted by a fleet auxiliaryabout 300 miles west of Trondheim proceeding on a westerly course at 20 knots.Air search failed to confirm this report owing to fog. A detachment from theHome Fleet was despatched to intercept this force.Foreign Waters.Patrols have been established off the coast of Spain to intercept Italianmerchantmen in the event of war with Italy.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.13. There has been an increase in the activities of U-boats during the week.Seven or eight are believed to have been operating at the beginning of the week,but it is thought that most of these have now returned to their bases.Eight ships, 5 British, 1 Allied and 2 neutral, have been attacked bysubmarines, of which 7, totalling 34,454 tons, have been sunk. Five small ships(3 British, 2 French), totalling 1,440 tons, have been lost due to mines. Five ships(3 British, 2 neutral) have been sunk through causes unknown, totalling17,215 tons; and 8 British ships and 4 Belgian tugs, totalling 36,979 tons,have been sunk by aircraft. Details are given in Appendix III; these figures include some ships sunk in French Channel Ports.S.S. Silver Willow, on arrival at Capetown on the 5th June, reported havingbeen approached by a tanker of about 15,000 tons, similar to the Altmark, offthe Amazon on the 20th May.  This ship may possibly be a raider.A mis-fired time-bomb was found on board the S.S. City of Sydney when.her hold was cleared at Mauritius on the 31st May. This must have been placedon board at London or Antwerp.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. A total of 819 ships, including 111 Allied and 42 neutral, were convoyedduring the week. Of these, two were lost owing to submarine attack. Ninearmed merchant cruisers, 13 destroyers, 18 sloops and corvettes have been employedon escort duties. This brings the total number of ships convoyed since theoutbreak of war up to 23,100 (including 1,563 Allied and 3,163 neutral), out ofwhich 32 have been sunk, giving a loss ratio of about 1 in 719.15. Imports to the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 1st June again exceeded a million tons, the total being 1,107,550compared with 1,070,795 of the previous week. Oil and petrol imports, carried by 42 tankers, were 467,978 tons, an increase of 125,070 tons. Of this,154,700 tons were for France. Mineral imports were 185,968 tons, a smalldecrease of 4,853 tons. Cereal and flour imports were 182,632 tons, an increaseof 11,830 tons. Other food imports totalled 99,910 tons, of which 30,596 weresugar and molasses, and 8,999 were fruit. Four consignments of frozen meattotalled 8,169 tons. The British oil refinery ship Tafelberg, 13,640 tons, had a cargo of 14,400 tons of whale oil and 131 tons of liver flakes. The French FortMedine, 5,355 tons, brought an unspecified number of horses for France fromPhiladelphia.Anti-Submarine Operations.16. Early on the 31st May H.M. Sloop Weston attacked U. 13 with depth charges off Orfordness, and subsequently sunk her by gunfire. Three officers and22 ratings were picked up.
Ten other attacks (5 by aircraft and 5 by surface craft), for which no definitesuccess is claimed, were carried out during the week. In two of these attacks theaircraft estimated that one hit had been obtained.British Minesweeping and Enemy Minelaying.17. Magnetic mines have been laid by aircraft off Portsmouth and Dovermore than once during the week. Portsmouth was closed for two days from the30th May and for one day from the 2nd June; both the entrances to Dover were closed for one day each. Harwich, Portland and Weymouth have also been closedf for one day each, and Newhaven has been closed since the 30th May Mines havealso been dropped in the Needles Channel (which is not in use), and are suspectedelsewhere around the Isle of Wight.LL Sweep has exploded 3 mines in the Portsmouth approaches this week.The Boom Defence Vessel Cambrian, which was mined and sunk east of the horse Sand Fort on the 30th May, was considerably north of the swept channel,and was probably cutting across to the harbour entrance.In the vicinity of Dover 5 mines have been exploded by LL. Sweep, 1 byskids and 1 by M.D. vessel. Three mines have been exploded off Folkestone Pier,2 by LL Sweep and 1 by Skid.In the entrance to Harwich harbour 2 mines were exploded by skids on the1st June.18. Cherbourg has twice been closed during the week, and Le Havre hasbeen closed since the 3rd June, Dieppe has now been closed for eighteen days,but sweeping is not considered urgent as the port is not required at present.Enemy aircraft laid mines off Ostend, Dunkirk and La Panne. A largenumber of magnetic mines were dropped in the approaches to the harbour of dunkirk on the night of the 30th May/1st June, during the evacuation.Sweeping was not possible owing to the congestion of shipping, but the majorityof the vessels had previously been degaussed.During a searching sweep in the Sunk area LL sweep exploded a mine onthe 29th May.The total number of mines dealt with by the 5th June were 226 magnetic and388 contact mines.On account of a report from a British aircraft that unknown vessels, saidto be three destroyers and three M.T.B.&apos;s had been sighted steering east some25 miles off Skegness, early on the morning of the 2nd June, minelaying issuspected between the Humber and the Norfolk Coast.British Minelaying.19. British minelaying in the current week has been restricted by theemployment of vessels elsewhere. H.M.S. Teviot Bank and H.M.S. Plover laid300 mines in the East Coast Barrier on the 1st June and H.M.S. Narwhal laid50 mines on the 3rd June off Jsedenens in the region of Stavanger.Minelaying was also successfully carried out by fourteen Swordfish aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm on the night of the 31st May-lst June, by three on thefollowing night and by six on the 5th-8th June; six Hampdens of the RoyalAir Force were also used on this last occasion.German Naval Intelligence.20   There is no further evidence as to the positions and movements ofI a enemy surface craft to add to last week&apos;s report, except that confirmation is&apos; now available that the pocket battleship Lutzow (ex- Deutschland) reached Kielon the 13th-14th May with her stern badly damaged.German Merchant Shipping.21. Six German ships are reported to be on the way to Lulea where theywill load iron ore. It is also reported that ships are now trading regularlybetween German and Finnish ports, the cargoes being principally wood andcellulose. On the 1st June the Birkenfels, 6,322 tons, was ordered to Leningradto load cotton. The Birkenau, 1,990 tons, and the Krusau, 1,352 tons, are oeheved[21380] B 2
to have sailed from Memel on the 27th May with drafts for Norway. TheNorwegian Meteor, 3,718 tons, is reported to have been requisitioned as a Germanhospital ship.The Salzburg, 1,756 tons, arrived at Braila on the 30th May.The Luvsee, 2,370 tons, left Zelerika, Yugoslavia, on the 27th May for Triestewith a cargo of bauxite.  Another German ship has arrived there.The Usaramo, 7,775 tons, is the only ship in Vigo which is showing any sionsof activity. She has been repainted and has coaled from the Karnak. The numberof young Germans in the town has noticeably increased lately, and sixteen have joined the Usaramo.Considerable activity is reported to be taking place on board the german ships in Santos, Brazil, and in other South American ports. Germans of military age are said to be embarking.The eighteen German ships seized by the Dutch Authorities in the dutch east Indies have been renamed. They are being assembled at Batavia andSourabaya for an overhaul.Two ships at Kobe, Japan, the Burgenland, 7,320 tons, and the Elsa Essberger,6,103 tons, have recently been in dock and are now waiting with full bunkers. &apos;Economic Warfare.22. During the week ending the 1st June 1,066 tons of goods destined for germany were seized in prize. The bulk of this came from Italian ships and theremainder from Dutch ships. The total of Danish cargo seized in prize duringthe week ending the 1st June amounts to 10,923 tons, of which 8,024 tons are foodproducts and 2,239 tons are feeding stuffs. The Contraband Control dealt withthe cases of 50 ships during the week, of which 29 were final decisions on cases which had previously been recorded.The port of Luiea was reported to be open on the 31st May.Italy.23. The main concentrations of the Italian Navy are at Taranto and in theLower Tyrrhenean Sea. At Taranto there are 4 battleships, 3, 8-inch cruisers,1, 6-inch cruiser, 1 old cruiser, 27 destroyers and 23 submarines. At Spezia,there is 1 battleship, 1, 8-inch cruiser, 9 destroyers and 25 submarines. At Naples,there are 4, 6-inch cruisers, 4 destroyers and 10 submarines, and in Sicilian waters3, 8-inch cruisers, 8, 6-inch cruisers, 10 destroyers and 18 submarines, with afurther 7 submarines at Cagliari (Southern Sardinia).Two of the 4 battleships at Taranto are the recently completed 35,000-tonbattleships Vittorio Veneto and Littorio.In Italian Mediterranean possessions, there are 3 destroyers and 8 submarinesat Tobruk : 2 submarines at Benghasi, and 2 destroyers and 8 submarines atLeros or Rhodes.Preparations for war continue, among the more notable being the requisitioning of numerous small craft: the taking over of ships for troopcarrying : the transfer of the battleship Caio Duilio undergoing reconstructionat Genoa, and not yet fully completed, to Spezia : the removal from Genoa ofthe battleship Impero only launched a few months ago : and the clearing of thewarehouses on the quays at Genoa and Leghorn.Merchant Shipping.24. Few merchant ships have passed Gibraltar outward bound, and fewhave left Atlantic ports homeward bound for several days. Nearly all homeward-bound ships should be in the Mediterranean in about a week&apos;s time and thoseoutward bound could reach neutral harbours in about the same time.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.25. The evacuation of the B.E.F. and the French Forces north of theRiver Somme has been completed. The total number of personnel evacuated isshown in Appendix I.After the cessation of fighting in the Dunkirk area, the German forces werereorganised with a view to undertaking a new offensive, and the armoured
formations were withdrawn for refitting. It has been difficult to obtain anyaccurate account of the casualties suffered by the Germans in the drive to theChannel Ports, but their losses are believed to have been heavy, and one-third toa half of the armoured forces are possibly out of action.26. In spite of their losses, however, a new offensive was launched on the5th June on the front from St. Valery to Laon; the main thrusts being directedsouth-west from St. Valery, south from Amiens, south-west from Peronne andsouth-west from Chauny. At the moment a minimum of three armies appears tobe taking part in this offensive, and at least one armoured division has been identified in action south of Amiens, but there are probably others.It is believed that further armoured formations are being assembled north of the Aisne, presumably with a view to action later, and it is possible that afurther attack may be directed towards Rheims.Scandinavia.27. Since the capture of Narvik progress towards the Swedish frontier hasbeen somewhat slow. On the Narvik peninsula Allied troops have capturedStromness, but are now held up by German forces in a prepared position abouteight miles east of Narvik town. North of the Rombaks Fjord Norwegian troops have made some progress. Two Polish battalions from the Ankenes peninsulahave advanced and come up into line with our advanced troops on the Narvikpeninsula.Narvik was heavily bombed on the 2nd June, but R.A.F. fighters shot downsix enemy machines for certain and a further seven unconfirmed. Since then no enemy air activity has been reported. As a result of the damage done to therailway and quays, and to the numerous wrecks in the harbour, it has been estimated, after a reconnaissance, that it will take a year to make Narvik usablefor the export of iron-ore.28. The 24th Guards Brigade and the five independent companies have withdrawn from Bodo by sea to the Narvik area. The evacuation of Bodo was completed without loss during the night the 31st May/1st June. The decisivefactor, which rendered it impracticable to delay the enemy any longer in this area,was German air superiority. German forces have now advanced north of Bodo,and some are reported to be moving up the coast towards Narvik by sea in smalllocal craft.Italy and Italian Possessions.29. Military indications of offensive intentions may be summarised asfollows : .(a) Concentration of troops on the Franco-Italian and  Italo-Yugoslavfrontiers and in Sicily.(b) Movement of reinforcements to Libya.(c) Military evacuation of Rome.(d) Calling up of reservists.(e) Defensive precautions in the Dodecanese Islands. .(/) Secret mobilisation and certain minor concentrations in Italian EastAfrica.(g) Active and passive air defence measures.The present strength of the Italian Army is estimated at more than 1,400,000.A considerable expansion has taken place recently in the Corps of Frontier Guards,more especially in artillery units. This has occurred principally opposite theFrench frontier, where the defences are reported to have been increased in depth.Reinforcements have continued to arrive in Libya. Since the 30th May,17,000 troops have arrived at Tripoli and 1,000 at Bengasi. The white garrisonis now estimated at 208,000.Turkey and the Balkan States.30.   In Roumania some 300,000 reservists have been called up for 30 days&apos;training, thus bringing the total number of men under arms to about 1,200,000.In Bulgaria about half the active army (five divisions) is concentrated
towards the Greek and Turkish frontiers. Troops near the Thracian frontiernow number approximately 50,000. It is not considered that these concentrationshave any offensive purpose.No reliance should be placed on press reports of Yugoslav concentrationsnear the Bulgarian frontier. Formations in Eastern Yugoslavia remain at neacestrength. Eight divisions near the Hungarian, Italian and Albanian frontiersand in Dalmatia are, however, at war strength, and work on the defences in these areas is progressing.Although the present mobilisation in Hungary is not yet general, it is bein^carried out on a considerable scale and, in constrast with the mobilisation ofAugust 1939, with some secrecy. The present strength of the army is estimated to be about 350,000.Middle East.31. The 14th Infantry Brigade and the 1st Hampshire Regiment have been moved from Palestine to Egypt, where they will be employed on canal defence and internal security. Two West African brigade groups, without mechanical transport, left Lagos on the 4th June for Kenya.AIR  SITUATION.General Review.32. The intensity of air operations in France and Flanders relaxedappreciably with the last stages of the Dunkirk evacuation but is now increasingagain as the Somme battle develops, both sides using their air forces in supportof land operations. The German offensive was preceded by extensive air attacks on France, which are now being extended to this country, though, so far, withinsignificant results. Royal Air Force bombing attacks on industry and communi-cations in Germany and in German-occupied territory have been maintained at considerable intensity in spite of adverse weather conditions, and similar attacksare now being made by the French Air Force.Operations on the Norwegian coast have been maintained by the coastal command. The activity of German bombers at Narvik has been restricted by our fighters.Air Defence of Great Britain.33. Enemy activity over this country has been on the same lines as duringthe previous week, and has been entirely secondary to the German operations in France. There have been sporadic mine-laying sorties at night and somereconnaissances have crossed the coast. On the night of the lst-2nd June a singleraider came in near Norwich, showing navigation lights, and dropped somebombs which fell near a searchlight and injured one of the personnel. On thefollowing night (2nd-3rd June) a mine-laying aircraft dropped two mines inland,which exploded knUr in a field in Sussex. On the night of the 5th-6th june the first raids of any magnitude took place; about 130 tracks were plotted duringthe night and many bombs were dropped on or near aerodromes from the thames estuary to Yorkshire. So far as is known at present the damage amounts onlyto two aircraft destroyed and eight men wounded. During the day on the5th June a Do. 17 was intercepted by a Gladiator near the Shetlands, and isbelieved to have been damaged.Western Front.34. Operations have again been very intense except on one or two days when weather conditions were unfavourable. There was, however, considerablerelaxation after the evacuation of Dunkirk. During the week, 1,198 fightersorties were flown in Northern France by aircraft of Fighter Command basedon England, and 201 by the three Squadrons of the Air Striking Force. Therewere 110 confirmed enemy casualties, and 68 unconfirmed; 48 of our fighters are missing, and some others returned damaged by enemy fire.35. The effort of Bomber Command has been equally intense and 310 day and 142 night sorties were carried out against objectives in the battle area
during the week. The objectives chosen have been mainly road and rail com-munications, and traffic moving along them; batteries and tanks have also been attacked. On the 5th June and the following night the field of operations wasin the rear of the German offensive then developing towards the South. successful results have been observed on many occasions, and there has been little effectiveinterruption by anti-aircraft fire or fighters. Our losses amount to six Blenheimsand three heavy bombers.36. Similar attacks were carried out on the 31st May by aircraft of theFleet Air Arm acting with Coastal Command. Batteries, bridges and jettieson the coast were attacked by ten Albacores and nineteen Skuas, which are believed to have done considerable damage. Two Skuas were lost, and one,possibly two, enemy aircraft were shot down.37. The Air Component has continued to operate from England andeighteen Blenheim and forty-three Lysander sorties had been flown up to the4th June, with the loss of six aircraft missing and one damaged. The bomber squadrons of the A.A.S.E. have operated farther South, mainly at night Fromthe 28th May to the 5th June, 103 night sorties and twelve daylight sorties havebeen flown, without loss. The purpose of the raids has been mainly to harassenemy communications, and the objectives attacked have been principally theMeuse crossings m the Givet area, and railway communications near Conz andin the rear of the Siegfried line. Direct hits have been scored on roads onmoving trains and on other objectives. On one occasion what appeared to be adump of small arms ammunition blew up after the attack, and on another direct hits were obtained on sheds alongside the railway station at Conz, which explodedwith a concussion which shook the aircraft.Attacks on Germany.38. During the week there have been 350 night bombing sorties against objectives in Germany and only four aircraft have failed to return. the objectives attacked in Germany may be classified as follows : No. ofsorties. Objectives.18        Oil storage at Hamburg.Nil.65        Oil storage at Homburg.Oil storage at Osterrnoor.Marshalling yards at Osnabruck and Hamm, andin the Ruhr.30        Hydrogenation plant at Hamburg.Marshalling yards near Rheydt and Duren.Marshalling yards at Hamm, Osnabruck, Duis-burg and Soest.136        Marshalling yards in the Ruhr.Oil refineries at Monheim and Reisholz.Synthetic oil plant at Homburg, Gelsenkirchenand Kamen.57        Oil storage at Mannheim and Frankfurt.44        Oil refineries at Hamburg.Marshalling yards at Wedau and Rheydt.Railway junctions at Euskirchen and Duren.39. Weather conditions have not always been favourable, and it hassometimes been impossible to identify the primary objective; secondary objectives of military importance, including enemy aerodromes, have generally been foundand bombed successfully. Direct observation of results is naturally difficult, butthe attacks on the oil objectives have generally been followed by fires and explosions; at Mannheim and Frankfurt a fierce blaze was started which wasvisible more than 120 miles away. On other occasions direct hits have been observed on railway communications.May 30-31May 31-June 1 ....June 1-2....June 2-3..June 3-4....June 4-5....June 5-6....
40. Coastal Command aircraft carried out thirty-six sorties against oil installations at Rotterdam and Ghent.Norway.41. There has been considerable fighter activity in the Narvik area, and reconnaissance and harassing raids have been carried out along the norwegian coast by aircraft of Coastal Command.42. During the week the two fighter squadrons based at Narvik flew136 sorties, and fifteen confirmed and ten unconfirmed enemy aircraft were destroyed by them. At the end of the period seven Hurricanes and eightGladiators were available for operations; it is not known how far the lossesincurred have been due to enemy action.43. On the 31st May three Blenheims attacked oil tanks at Bergen, withoutobserved result; on the 1st June four Hudsons again raided the harbour and bombed oil installations and shipping, in face of intense anti-aircraft fire. Bombsfell close to oil tanks and to two merchant vessels. Other vessels and anti-aircraftgun positions were machined-gunned, and fire broke out at a wireless stationnorth of the town, which had also been attacked. On the 3rd June a sortie wasmade by four Hudsons to attack a new aerodrome reported under construction in the Trondhjem area; the aerodrome was not found. On the 4th June a specialreconnaissance was made of the Sogne Fjord and of the Fjords near Stavanger;twenty Heinkel lll&apos;s and twelve Me. 110&apos;s were seen on the aerodrome atStavanger. Six of the latter took off to attack, but were evaded. A dummyaerodrome has now been constructed about two miles from the main site. Duringthe same sortie a wireless station near Utyoer was effectively bombed and machine-gunned.North Sea and Coastal Operations.44. Aircraft of the Coastal Command continued to carry out coveringoperations for the withdrawal from Dunkirk. In the course of patrols off theDutch and Belgian Coasts numerous incidental engagements with enemy aircraftoccurred, and the reconnaissance machines were signally successful. On the1st June three Ansons, which were attacked by nine Me. 109s, shot down two ofthe attackers and damaged two others; all the Ansons returned safely, althoughdamaged by enemy fire. On the following day three Hudsons shot down twoJu. 88s and three Ju. 87s and damaged two other Ju. 87s, without loss to themselves.45. As reported in the Naval Situation, enemy submarines and M.T.B.S have again been repeatedly encountered and attacked : two direct hits were reported on submarines, and one M.T.B. was probably destroyed by an Albacore of theFleet Air Arm.. 46. Reconnaissances of the Norwegian Coast have already been described.Numerous enemy surface vessels were sighted in the Bight and off the Dutch and norwegian Coasts and some were attacked, a direct hit being made on a vesselat Terschelling. Mines were laid by aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm on three nights and six Hampdens also took part on the 5th/6th June.French Air Force Operations.47. During the period from the 30th May to the 2nd June the French AirForce carried out 578 fighter sorties, 85 reconnaissance sorties and 130 bombingsorties. Attacks were made on enemy troop concentrations, motor-transportcolumns and aerodromes. During the night of the 3rd/4th June barracks andthe B.M.W. aircraft factory were attacked at Munich. On the following nightthe same factory was again attacked, as was the chemical factory near Mannheim:Railway stations and aerodromes in the Rhineland were attacked on the samenights. French official reports now confirm that during the period from the10th to 28th May 313 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat, and that anadditional 119 were probably brought down; 160 were brought down by Frenchanti-aircraft fire. Very favourable reports have been received of the performance of the Dewoitine 520 fighter, which is now coming into service in first-line units.The fighter &quot; groupes &quot; equipped with Curtisses, Moranes and Blochs have also had considerable success.
German Air Operations.48. Operations during the first part of the week were mainly confined tobombing attacks in the Dunkirk area, in which aircraft from three long-rangebomber units were constantly employed. Other units carried out attacks on french communications on the Somme front and air support for the land offensiveincreases in intensity as the battle develops. On the 1st June what appears tohave been a planned air offensive was opened against French railways, factories and ports. The attacks have been maintained fairly steadily, and not less than200 aircraft have been engaged. The railway lines attacked included those fromLyons to Geneva, to Modane and to Marseilles; those from Paris to Dieppe,Rouen, Amiens and Soissons. Among the factories attacked were the Rhone-Poulenc chemical factories at Grenoble, a factory at Amberieu, and the Citroenaircraft factory and three other factories near Paris. The offensive againstFrench aerodromes, particularly in the Paris and Lyons area, was continued, andthe French Air Ministry was hit. Docks at Marseilles, and at other ports near the mouth of the Rhone, were attacked on the 1st and 2nd June, and Havre was heavily bombed during the night of the 3rd-4th June. It is known that several of the railway lines attacked were temporarily cut, but full reports of the damage done to other objectives are not yet available. Attacks are now being extendedto this country, as described in paragraph 33.49. Activity in the Narvik area has continued, but appears to have been substantially restricted by the activities of our fighter squadrons. There is areport, so far unconfirmed, that an attempt may be made to carry troops to the narvik area in seaplanes from the Gulf of Bothnia.German Air Intelligence.50. German aircraft casualties from the 10th May to the 4th June are estimated at 2,847 aircraft. The fact that the German wireless recently broadcastan appeal for volunteers for the German Air Force is not in itself an indication of shortage of personnel. The flying branch of the Air Force has always beendependent largely on volunteers, and such appeals have always been part of thenormal recruiting procedure. It is reliably reported, however, that six aircraft of troop-carrying type, which had previously been acquired by Hungary, havenow been returned to Germany, and that deliveries of Messerschmitts to yugoslavia have been stopped on the grounds that all stocks are needed for the battle in progress, and that all aircraft leaving the factories are being sentimmediately to the French front.51. A short appreciation on German transport of troops by air is included as Appendix VII.Italy.52. There has been on the whole little flying activity during the past ten days, but on the 3rd June twenty-four fighters and fourteen bombers flew low overRome, apparently with the intention of impressing the population. A numberof new anti-aircraft guns became available during the first week of May, andhave been sent to the Milan area. Various A.R.P. exercises were carried out inMilan last week, and the results are said to have been satisfactory. More A.A.guns are now arriving from Germany. The Ala Littoria services through Iraqwere suspended on the 3rd June, and the staff left Baghdad by the last west-bound aircraft.53. The output of aircraft is still in the neighbourhood of three hundred amonth, but great efforts are being made to increase the figure for June to 350.It is reported that the firm of Pirelli are now fitting a type of self-sealing petroltank to newly constructed bombers, and that many of the existing bombers arebeing re-equipped.54 In Libya, orders have recently been issued that the movements of units,ne stocking of advanced landing-grounds and the installation of field wirelesssets must be completed by the 4th June. It is now definitely established thathere are fifteen troop-carrying aircraft, each capable of taking forty men, in, ya- Their present location is uncertain, as they move freely from station to station, but they are probably based in the Tripoli sector., .     [21380] G
Spain.55. Fairly large quantities of aviation spirit, bombs and equipment arebeing sent to Las Palmas in the Canaries, although at present only six bombersare stationed there. Extensive work on aerodromes is being done, both inGrand Canary and in Tenerife, which seems to indicate that reinforcements maybe sent. No movements of service aircraft to Spanish Morocco have beenreported, but petrol and other necessary equipment is being accumulated by the units already established&apos; there. A Spanish military mission, headed byGeneral Canovas, has proceeded to Germany via Italy.Switzerland.56. The Swiss Air Force contains no bomber aircraft. Its fighter strength is thought to consist of about ninety-six modern (Messerschmitt 109 andMorane 405) and forty-eight obsolescent (Dewoitine 501) aircraft. The totalfirst-line strength is made up to 270 aircraft by 126 army co-operation and reconnaissance aircraft, all of obsolete or obsolescent types. Swiss fighters havebeen in action more than once during the past week against German aircraftviolating their neutrality, and have had some successes.Russia.57. Large numbers of aircraft took part in the May Day parade in Moscow,but, so far as observed, they suggest no grounds., for modifying our present estimates of Russian air strength. Several prototypes were also seen in the airfor the first time, and included two new single-engined fighters and a four-engined bomber. Their performances are said to be good, but below the standardof the best British and French aircraft.Japan.58. It is possible that the Japanese air forces in Hainan have been reinforced by fifty aircraft, but there is no other Japanese air activity whichsuggests aggressive intentions toward the Netherlands East Indies.United States.59. Four new anti-aircraft batteries were formed on the 1st May in thePanama Canal zone. The new Naval air station at San Juan in Puerto Ricowas also placed in commission on. the 1st May. Steps have also been taken to reinforce the Canal zone with medium bombers and an interceptor squadron.

German Transport of Troops by Air.Troop carrying aircraft available. It is estimated that Germany has thefollowing aircraft available for transport of troops, armament, ammunition and supplies : Range.	No.	Type.	Normal Capacity.	Total.950 miles 830 miles 1,000 miles	670 100 30	JU 52 (some on floats)   ... JU 86 f F.W. Condor \ \ JU 90          j	15 men 10 men 20 men	10,050 1,000 600	800			11,650Parachute Troops. It is believed that there is a minimum of about 5,000trained parachutists, but their numbers have probably been increased recently.These troops are believed to be organised into battalions of about 550 each. Eachbattalion is equipped with one 7-5-cm. (2-95-inch) mountain gun, one 8-1-cm.(3 - 16-inch) mortar, three 5-cm. (2-inch) mortars, twelve heavy machine guns, fifty-four light machine guns, and fifty-four machine pistols; most men carry rifles.This organisation and armament is not necessarily standard, and parachutetroops may be organised, armed and equipped according to their task.Air Landing Troops and Troops transported in Aircraft. It was recentlyestimated that between 5,000 and 6,000 men had received special training in air-landing duties; this number could be rapidly increased. Special air-landingtroops will probably be armed with machine pistols, light and heavy machine guns, light 5-cm. (2-inch) and heavy 8 - 1-cm. (3 - 16-inch) mortars, and with 7 - 5-cm.(2-95-inch) mountain guns.When ordinary infantry units or formations are transported in aircraft, itmay be assumed that each infantryman will carry his normal equipment, and thatin addition light (2-inch) and heavy (3-16-inch) mortars, 7-5-cm. (2-95-inch)infantry guns, and possibly some 10-5-cm. (4-14-inch) gun howitzers, accordingto the circumstances, will be transported.Ammunition and Supplies. Supplies are unlikely to last more than a weekunless they can be augmented from local resources in enemy country. It shouldbe possible to carry a good supply of small arms ammunition, but ammunition for heavier weapons will be strictly limited.Landing Grounds. Any open flat ground 600 yards by 600 yards is suitable.Such operations would, however, be impossible unless the German Air force had temporary air superiority and could protect the transport of the troopsen route and during and after landing.Method of Landing Parachutists. This will be carried out in an area whichhas previously been carefully studied and reconnoitred. The aircraft fly information and the parachutists leave them at heights of from 250 to 300 feet.The time taken to land a formed body of troops depends on how quickly themen follow one another from the aircraft.Conclusion. Apart from the landing of small numbers of parachute troops for sabotage or special missions, it is not likely that operations by air-bornetroops will be undertaken, except in the following circumstances : (a) where the German Air Force has temporary local air superiority;(b) where operations by other German forces ensure that airborne troops arereinforced with artillery and tanks soon after landing;(c) where the troops landed can be maintained and, if necessary, provided with transport.If these factors are in German favour, troops might be landed at a rate of^000 an hour per landing ground.
