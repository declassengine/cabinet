Thishas taken the form of guerrilla warfare, in the course of which bands of nativesunder the command of the local chieftains of greater or less degree have harassedItalian communications and isolated posts. This rebel activity has imposedsomething of a strain upon the Italian Administration, but it has never representedanything in the shape of co-ordinated military action against the occupying power. The native chieftains who have taken the field nave done so entirely on their own initiative, without much, or possibly any, contact with their co-fighters in other districts, and little, if any, support from abroad. Thisendemic disorder has never seriously threatened the Government of Italian EastAfrica centred in Addis Ababa, but it has been a source of constant preoccupationto them, and has involved the periodic despatch of punitive columns to deal withrebels. During the last few months conditions have deteriorated in Abyssinia,and there has even been fighting within 100 miles of Addis Ababa, in the courseof which the Italians have suffered appreciable losses.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government having accepted the de jure recognition ofthe new Italian Empire under the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 1938have refrained from giving effect to any policy of actively promoting internaldisorder in Abyssinia. Developments in that country have, however, been carefully watched, and, as the attitude of Italy has become more and more menacingduring recent months, certain preparations have been made in limitrophe British11071   [21410] b
and Anglo-Egyptian territories in order that we might be ready, in the eventof Italian participation in the war on the side of the &quot;enemy, to exploit to thebest of our ability the existing conditions of internal insecurity in AbyssiniaIt has been felt that, if Italy entered the war on the side of the enemy, Abyssiniacould be converted into a grave military liability, and that if our efforts in thisdirection were successful, the war effort of the Italians south of the Suez Canalcould be seriously handicapped. To this end channels of communication betweenlimitrophe British colonial and Anglo-Egyptian territories and Abyssinia havebeen kept open and lately developed. It is unnecessary to go into details of thepreparatory action that has been taken. It will suffice to say that experiencedofficers are available in Egypt and the.Sudan; as well as in British Somalilandand Kenya, for special work in connexion with Abyssinia, that funds have been collected, that facilities are available for the printing of Amharic pamphletsto be dropped from the air, and that contact has been established with at least two of the guerrilla leaders now in the field; and now that Italy has definitelyentered the lists, the special section of General Headquarters, Middle East, atCairo, which is responsible for Abyssinian affairs, would be able to give effectto the plans which have been maturing during recent months. While no immediateresults are to be anticipated, it may be hoped that before long the machinery which, within the limited scope of our resources, has been set up, will be in motion and in process of being considerably expanded. The most urgent need is arms, but of these there is, unhappily, a shortage at present.3. During the period of Italian non-belligerency it was necessary for political reasons to have as little to do with the Emperor of Abyssinia as possible.On the 10th June the need for this caution was, however, dissipated. His Majestyhaving established himself at a London hotel, it was ascertained on the 11th and12th June that he wished to return to Abyssinia for the purpose of leading in person the struggle against the enemy. To this end the Emperor desires toproceed to the Sudan with a view to entering Abyssinia across the western ornorth-western frontier. His exact plan of action could only be decided uponafter his arrival at Khartum. He is anxious to proceed there with the least possible delay. At the same time he wishes to send one of his sons to EastAfrica, as he feels that the presence of a member of the Imperial Family would greatly encourage not only the tribes of the Ogaden territory, but also the abyssinian refugees in British Somaliland and Kenya, of whom it is hoped tomake effective use. The Emperor is also anxious to issue a proclamation to the abyssinian people, the French text of which is attached as Annex 1 to this paper.It is proposed that this document, which has been telegraphed to General Head-quarters, Cairo, should be printed in Amharic and distributed from the air overAbyssinian territory. His Majesty further contemplates the issue of a com-munique&quot; to the press, and the draft statement is attached as Annex 2. In addi-tion, he has furnished the Foreign Office informally with a document containing a number of suggestions as to the best course of action to pursue in Abyssinia,and has besides supplied proof that he himself has been in touch with certain of the rebel leaders, as well as with refugee elements in British Somaliland andKenya.4. Apart from his contacts with official circles, the Emperor is in touch withcertain political elements in this country, as well as with various pro-Abyssinianorganisations and bodies such as the Abyssinia Association-to whom he has nodoubt outlined his ambitions. This means that there is a very Jnsiderable riskof premature publicity on the part of persons who may not appreciate that theenemy is likely to exert himself to the utmost against the possible reappearanceof the Emperor upon the Abyssinian scene. Some doubt has existed during thelast four years as to the extent to which the Emperor is now accepted by the nativechieftains and population of Abyssinia as their legitimate ruler. There is noquestion that when His Majesty abandoned Addis Ababa immediately prior tothe Italian occupation in May 1936, his stock slumped very severely. In the months that intervened before the Italian forces had spread across the country,certain tribes, such as the Galla, revolted against their Amharic overlords, andthere is no reason to suppose that these, or other peoples once persecuted underAmharic despotism, would welcome the return of Haile Selassie with any undueenthusiasm. On the other hand, it is a fact that the chieftains who are nowconducting guerrilla warfare against the Italians belong to the ruling Amhara
[21410]stock. The areas in which conditions are most unfavourable to the Italians arehi Tigre, in the north-west, and Gojjam, in the centre, and to the south-east ofthe capital. In short, the elements in Abyssinia who may be expected to supportthe Emperor are the warlike Amhara, who for so long ruled the country. It is,therefore, arguable that for this reason alone, since it is our object to organiseas much military activity in Abyssinia as is possible, the balance of advantagelies in co-operating with the Emperor and facilitating his return. There is noother personality whom we can use as the centre-piece of Abyssinian revolt. Ifthis is accepted, it is clear that, if only in the interests of his own safety, no publicity should be given to the fact that arrangements are being made for his return, at least until he reaches Khartum. A public declaration of support ofthe Emperor, although it may be demanded by his followers in this country, wouldalso be undesirable in the light of its possible effects in Italy. We should do nothing to nullify the advantage we now possess of a divided public opinion inthat country where the name of Haile Selassie is anathema.5. Having regard to the impossibility of foreseeing to-day what the exactcondition of Abyssinia is likely to be at the termination ,of the war with Italy,it is submitted that our first objective must be to free ourselves from pastcommitments, without, however, mortgaging the future. It is clear that theItalian declaration of war frees His Majesty&apos;s Government from any engagementspreviously entered into with the Italian Government, and that, therefore, if itsuits the purpose of His Majesty&apos;s Government to repudiate their recognitionof Italian sovereignty qver Abyssinia, they are at full liberty to do so. A promise to take steps to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to recognise Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia formed part of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April,1938, and His Majesty&apos;s Government duly carried out their promise. HisMajesty&apos;s Government naturally no longer regard themselves as bound by a promise given as part of an agreement which Italy by her declaration of war hasunilaterally repudiated. There would be nothing in such a policy to preclude the giving of assurances to the Emperor, as well as by proclamation or other means to the chieftains and people of Abyssinia, that the Allied Powers have no terri-torial ambitions in that country. Such assurances are of importance, sinceItalian propaganda has to an increasing extent during recent months concen-trated upon disseminating the belief among the natives that Britain and Franceintend to parcel Abyssinia between them in the event of a successful issue to thepresent war.6. In the light of the foregoing it is therefore recommended that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should (1) Co-operate with the Emperor of Abyssinia and, if he so desires, facilitatehis return, and that of members of his family, to his own country.(2) Issue a declaration stating that, in view of Italy&apos;s unprovoked entry intothe war against the Allies, His Majesty&apos;s Government for their parthold themselves entitled to reserve full liberty of action in respect ofany undertakings given by them in the past to the Italian Govern-ment concerning the Mediterranean, North or East African, and middle Eastern areas.(3) Take all possible steps to foment anti-Italian action on the part of the peoples of Abyssinia.Foreign Office, June 16, 1940.

IP--ANNEX No. 2.Communique to the Press.NOT relaxing in his crimes against civilisation and the deliberate killing,maiming and heartbreaking of the peoples of the world, and therein of his own,the tyrant of Italy has declared war upon France and Britain, lovers of peace and order.This is the man who, five years ago, invaded a peaceful Ethiopia with bombs,poison gas and all the treacherous apparatus of destruction; and who, ever since, has sown misery and mischief in the world, or in a servile manner lackeyedthose who had more power to do so than himself.To-day he has overreached himself, while adding to the sum of humansuffering. His impudent declaration will be the signal throughout the plateauxof my country for my people to rise in a single movement for independence andpitiless justice.Too long have my people been tortured unheard. Too long have the bravestof my subjects been put to death with unspeakable cruelty, their churches and villages destroyed, their crops stolen, their women and children defiled, enslavedand brutalised.In 1936 and the years following I pleaded that their sorrows should be heard.Now the time has come to say : Enough. Leaning on God Himself, with theirown right hands and the aid of their great Allies, Britain and-France, in thename of all the martyred and dispossessed, my people will take their rightful due.Ethiopia has been free for two thousand years.   She will be free again.I, Haile Sellassie, Elect of God, Emperor of Ethiopia, tell my people as one man to strike hard, that the reign of love and mercy may live again in Ethiopia.Mindful of the example of my great predecessors, John and Menelik, andsteadfast in my duty to the end, I will take their head again in this final struggle.In the last five years we have learned how to deal with the Italians.To our neighbours of Egypt and the Sudan and Arabia I say, beware the professions of a man who, like the common run of cowards, dares not even attack the weak and innocent without false appearances of friendship and the smile oftreason.  Be on your guard.  Remember that he made many false promises to me.To all the peaceful peoples of the world and to our faithful Allies andfriends, struggling for a deliverance that God will grant, I pledge myself and my people in loyalty until the righteou^day shall dawn.HAILE SELLASSIE I,Emperor of Ethiopia.7* - i IIIIIIIMIfMwWyiWWHMWMIIIillllllilofficiers ou des soldats anglais et francais, recevez-les en amis et en libeh-ateurs.Us sont pour chacun de nous des freres d&apos;armes et des notes sacres.Vive l&apos;Ethiopie libre et independante, vivent la France et la Grande-Bretagne!Ecrit dans la Cite de Londres, le     juin 1940.
