THIS DOCUMENT IS TlSB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOgEBNMEMT       to BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.    //flj C R B T.wj3.(40) 181.89TH MAY. 1940,opy no.was cabinet.QUESTION OF INPOPJvtINGr NORWEGIANGOVBRNftlENT OF OUR INTENTION to evacuate NARVIK.memorandum by the secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs,,I have been considering the problem of how andwhen to tell the Norwegian Government of the decision to evacuate the Allied forces from North Norway.     i recognise that the case for not saying anything before itcan be helped is a very strong one on security grounds,but the following considerations have to be set on the&apos;other side.(a) The Norwegians will inevitably find out what is afoot very soon after the firstpreparations for the evacuation are actually made and we should then whenquestioned by the Norwegians find ourselves in a most embarrassing position, particularly after theattitude we have adopted towards therecent action of the King of theE q, &apos; o&quot;;.,ans o(??) Quito apart- from this we are under ageneral ncral obligation to our Alliesnot to dericirt them without warning, andin the particular case of Norway we arealready accused.,, both in Norway and in sweden^ of having abandoned theNorwegian army without warning atAandalsnes and at NamsoSc(c) Moreover it is, as the Ministry ofShipping have pointed out, of extreme importance to us to maintain our control over Norwegian shipping.     TheNorwegian crews on whom we depend forthis operation are already restive andthe evacuation will make them stillmore so;    and for this reason alone itis essential for us to handle in advance the problem of the evacuation with thegreatest possible consideration forNorwegian interests, and to do everything

it)we can not to embitter more than isnecessary the Norwegian Governmentand people when the evacuation doestake place5 - for example we should offer to bring to this country whatremains of the Norwegian army, aswell as  the King and Government,(d) That offer, however, would obviouslynot be a serious one, capable ofbeing carried out in practice, unless it were made at once, and this is afurther reason for taking theNorwegian Government into our confidence.2. I have considered the possibility of leaving asmall Allied force at Narvik in order to prevent the norwegians from throwing up the sponge altogether;   butthis would be unlikely to secure the desired result since it would be in itself a confession of our inability togive effective help, while it would result in thepopulation of North Norway continuing to be exposed to german attack and would impose upon ourselves the strainof continued maintenance of the force0      I have thereforediscarded it.3. I have also considered the possibility of encouraging the plans for the neutralisation of NorthNorway and of placing the Narvik area under Swedishprotection on which we have been sounded by the swedish government;    any such scheme would involve lengthynegotiations with the German Government which, even in theunlikely event of the Germans agreeing to it, could not possibly result in agreement before the evacuation hadtaken place.     The Norwegian Government moreover mightclaim, if we encouraged them to consider this scheme,that we were under an obligation not to evacuate until ithad been thoroughly explored..    Apart from this, it isclearly not desirable in view of the shipping situationalready mentioned, to do anything to encourage theNorwegian Government to make terms with the Germans.They may indeed do this anyhow when they learn of theevacuation but this is a development which we must obviously wish to avoid if possible, both because thedefection of an Ally is undesirable on general grounds and because the Germans may be expected to demand thewithdrawal of Norwegian shipping from the Allied service as the price of any agreement.4. I am therefore driven to the conclusions -(a) that we must presumably keep to our plan oftotal withdrawal from North Norway,(b) that we must both for the sake of our ownreputation and in view of the danger ofthe Norwegian Government negotiating with the Germans, offer to bring off as many Norwegian troops as may wish toleave with our -own, as well.as the king and the Government, and

(c) that we must give adequate noticesince we cannot otherwise make that offer effective, and ahoveall because of our moral obligation to the norwegian government,5. Accordingly, I should like authority to instruct sir C. Dormer to speak to the King of Norway and theMinister of Defence Colonel Ljungberg, (the other membersof the Norwegian Government not being of absolutelyreliable discretion)  in the following sense, emphasising the absolute need for secrecy,,&quot;H.M. Government have reviewed the position in thelight of recent events in Belgium and Northern Prance,Owing to the additional strain on their resources in this country and the necessity of defending it frominvasion it is not possible for them to supply defence against the persistent air attack which the allied occupation of North Norway will continue to attract.The dangers of this air attack to the civilian populationhave already been emphasised by the Norwegian government themselves.     In any&quot;case the restoration of Norwegianindependence depends upon the capacity of the BritishEmpire to resist the present attack upon it;    and if weare to achieve this purpose all available forces will inpresent cases be required for the defence of the british isles.His Majesty&apos;s Government are accordingly obliged tomake arrangements for the early withdrawal of the allied forces from Norway and will be prepared in doing so tobring away the King of Norway, the Norwegian Governmentand as many Norwegian troops as may wish to come to theUnited Kingdom and continue the fight with the Allies on other battle fields,,&quot;6. Sir C0 Dormer would not of course be told the exactdates for the various stages. of,Tthe evacuation, and if.these are not disclosed to &quot;Che Norwegian Government, the communication to be made to them should not greatly increasethe risk of the Germans being able to prepare a concentratedattack, timed to take place while the evacuation was actually in progress? which is, I gather, the chief if notthe only reason why it is desired to keep the operationsecret as long as possible,,(Intdo)    Hoforeign Office, S.yy.1.
