(40) 214. (Revise.).jgjgg JUNE. 1940.WAR CABINET..;ECONOMIC HELP FROM THE AMERICAS.ACTION REQUIRED TO BE taken at ONCE, -..Note by the Minister without Portfolio.In the Memorandum which I recently circulated on theextent to which we shall need to draw on the resources of the tr -Americas if we are to achieve victory,  (Paper W..P. (-40)  209),I set out in general terms the nature of the problems confrontingus.2. The next step is to decide the nature of the approach which we should make to the United States Administration..3. I accordingly suggest that we should at once address a communication to the United States Administration.:-(1)    explaining that if we are to have a fair chance ofobtaining victory, or even of maintaining ourresistence for a prolonged period,  it will be essential for us to obtain from the United Statessupplies of aircraft and other munitions, and essential raw materials on an altogether larger-; . scale than hitherto;(2)    indicating that if the United States are to assist us in this way,  far reaching measures ofindustrial organisation will be necessary:    thatthis reorganisation will involve reducing theallocation of steel,  aluminium and other materials,for consumption in the United States domestic market and arrangements to secure in the case ofraw materials, productive capacity and skilledman-power alike,  the requisite degree of priority ....to enable our needs to be met in the shortest possible period; and. suggesting the immediateopening of discussions between the administration and ourselves in order to secure as soon aspossible,  that, where -the total available supplieseither of raw materials or of machine tools is limited, the allocation of these resources betweenthe United States, Canada and this country should beCOPY NO.
made in such a way as to secure the largest possibleoutput in the shortest possible time5       *-&apos; r ;(3)    explaining frankly to the Administration the-&apos;utter impossibility of our continuing to     &apos;secure essential armamentss raw materials,and foodstuffs, with which the United States     &quot;&apos; - -caa supply us, if those can only be obtained onthe cash and- carry basis;    and accordingly pressing the   ,dministration,  either by amendment of the&quot;. Johnson Act or otherwise^ to make it possible forus to secure credits with which to obtain armaments,raw materials, and foodstuffs in the quantities whichthe present circumstances make vitally necessary;(4) drawing attention to the risk that with the development!of total war and the consequent great increase in the call on the Royal Navy, our merchant marine may for a that least; suffer a much higher rate of loss than hithertfand in consequence, pressing the Administration, either!.   .    by the amendment of the Neutrality Act or otherwise,once to secure the immediate withdrawal of the presentembargo on ships flying the United States flag entering the war zone,  and instead to permit such ships to bring!- imports to this country;    and inviting the Administratifto examine with Us the possibilities of devisingadministrative measures to secure the most effectivejoint use for our v/ar purposes of the mercantile marine!of the United States, of this country and- our allies,and of the Central and Southern American States;(5)   pressing them;-(a) either by the use of the powers conferred under&apos;che Defence Act now before Congress or by a develolrnent of the present &quot;moral1&quot; embargo, to put acomplete  stop to all exports, direct or indirect, jfrom the United States to Germany and Italy;(b) to obtain powers to block financial balances andother assets belonging to the enemy;. (c)    to take steps to render impossible the return from the United States to Europe of German technic!- . either for military service or for employment as.skilled operatives in the munitions industries;(6) proposing the immediate despatch of an Economic Missionunder an outstanding personality for the purpose of. concerting with the administration the assistance in the *economic fields which we need to obtain from the UnitedStates of America., and through them, from Central and .South&apos;American States,,(Intld)a . a.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1S5TII JUNE, 1940o
