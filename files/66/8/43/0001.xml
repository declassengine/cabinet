I / .       J0Talso C.O.S.(40)471).19TH JUNE. 1940.WAR CABINET.URGENT MEASURES TO MEET ATTACK.-Report by the Chiefs of Staff,We recen-iy reported upon the means whereby we coulacontinue to fight single-handed if French resistance wereto collapse completely.      In that paper35 we stated thatthere were three ways in which Germany might break down the resistance of the United Kingdom - -unrestricted air attackaimed at breaking public morale;    starvation of the country by attack on shipping and ports;    and occupation by invasion.2o Now that organised French resistance is at an end,we are confronted with the very situation envisaged in that report o3* We cannot say for certain that Germany will attemptinvasion.      She is free to do so if she chooses, and? ifsuccessful, the result would be final.     Moreover, Germanynay consider that invasion offers her by far the quickestmethod of achieving a decision, and that it would succeedor fail before American assistance could take effect.Experience of the campaign in Flanders and Franceindicates that we can expect no period of respite before theGermans may begin a new phase of the war.     We must,therefore, regard the threat of invasion as immediate. -4. Prior to the German break through in France air attack had been regarded as the chief danger to thiscountry., and a full-scale invasion as an unlikely contingencyIn now emphasising the imminent threat of invasion we mustnot overlook the fact that a major air offensive against this country will almost certainly take.place as well, andwill tax our air defences and the morale of our people tothe full.x   W.P.(40) 168.

5.&apos;       The Germans have accepted prodigious losses in france, and are likely to he prepared to face even higherlosses and to take even greater risks than they took in norway to achieve decisive results against this country.The Gerrrian High Command and forces, flushed withthe fall of Paris and their rapid and unbroken series ofvictories, will be prepared to take any risks and accept any sacrifices to defeat this country this summer*     Wemust defeat this culminating effort if we are to look forward with confidence to victory next year;6. The issue of the war will almost certainly turnupon our ability to hold out during the next three months.Our efforts must therefore be concentrated on taking allsteps necessary to meet the imminent threat of attack withwhich we are now confronted.7, Prom the military point of view we feel that wecan have confidence in our ability to resist all formsof attack, only when the most drastic and far-reachingmeasures which we have already recommended in W.P.(40)168are completed.     We are seriously concerned with thefact that certaixi of the measures recommended inparagraph 23M of that report have not yet been carriedout, on the necessary scale, although they have beenapproved by the Government,     In particular we have inmind (iii) and (xiii).8. As regards Fifth Column activities we are informed&quot;by the Home Office that, out of approximately 76,000male and female Germans in this country, only 12,000have been interned and, out of 18,000 Italians, about ,500 have been interned.     To leave such a considerable proportion of enemy aliens at large at such a time as this seems to us to be taking unwarranted risks.9. Prom the purely military point of view weconsider that all enemy aliens should, bo detainedforthwith, on the; under standing that those who couldbe proved beyond all doubt to bo harmless could hereleased subsequently...     The problem has been furtheraggravated by the recent arrival in this country of numbers of Belgian and Dutch soleliorsj whoso sympathiesin many c;.e ;s arc. doubtful,     \7o realise the administrativedifficult!  j of interning such largo numbers of aliens,particularly on the score of acoCm^o&amp;ation, and accordinglysuggest tlv.it the quickest remedy would be to send themajority of them to Canada.     We understand that thenecessary permission for this has been obtained and that large liners are now available which could be used forthe purpose,10.       ero consider it of the highest importance thatdecentralisation of control to regional commisioners should be put into force to the greatest practicableextent at once, on the grounds that if this transition ofcontrol is delayed until the emergency arises, theconditions will then be such as to make it extremelydifficult to effect a proper change of control,s   A copy of this paragraph is attachedto this report.

11. We have seen reports supplied by the Ministry ofInformation about the general trend of public opinion throughout the country.      One point has particularlyimpressed us.      The public ask why more men are not being called up and put under discipline.      This criticism islikely to become more insistent as time goes on.     It is un-necessary in this report to explain the policy, which has so far governed the calling to the colours of the availableman power of the country, but we take the view that, inspite of the difficulties of accommodation,  training andthe provision of equipment, men who have now been registered and are awaiting calling up should be called up forthwith.12. If it is impossible to absorb the greater numberof these men in the -krmy at once, they might, as an interim measure, be employed with the Local Defence Volunteers orthe Civil Defence Services.      The important point is thatthese men should be organised in formed bodies and placed under discipline at once.Apart from the purely military aspect, we consider this measure to be of the utmost importance, if theconfidence of the public is to be maintained as to theGovernment&apos;s determii ation to resist attack on this country by all possible means.Recommendations.We recommend13.(a) That all the measures recommended in w.P.(40) 168 (see Annex I) which have notyet been completed should be pressed on with day and night and particularlyrecommendations(iii), and (xiii).(b) That action to intern the large number of Germanand Italian men and women still remainingat large in this country should be accelerated.We suggest that the administrative difficulties of interning them in this -country could be overcome by sending aconsiderable number of them to the canadian  large liners.(c) That decentralisation of control to Regional. Commissioners should be put into force to thegreatest practicable extent at once-,(paragraph 10).(d) That men who have recently been registered andare now waiting to be called-up. should becalled up forthwith (paragraphs 11 and 12).(e) That consideration should be given to extending the&quot;childrens&apos; overseas reception scheme&quot;(W.P.. (G)  (40)152) Ao include old and infirmmpersons and those who cannot contribute usefullyto the defence of this country.&apos;&quot;(f) That the area bordering the East, South East andSouth Coast from Tyneside to Portland (inclusive)should be declared a defended area.(g) In order to avoid administrative delays throughoutthe machine of Government, there should, be the widest delegation of executive and financial powers in each department and throughout the Services.Si,richmond Terrace 9    S*W.l.(Signed)      G..L.N.

ANNEX fT.RE C OMMENDATI ONS.23.       The following recommendations were drafted &quot;beforethe Bill conferring on the Government complete power ofcontrol over persons and property for the prosecution of the war was passed.     We have not had the opportunityof studying the details of this Bill, so some of our recommendations are no doubt covered by its provisions.We recommend that the foolowing measures should becarried out NOW, irrespective of events in Prance.     these measures are confined to those which we consider necessaryfor the security of this country against attack during the critical period that may arise in the next few months:-(i)    We shouxd do our utmost to persuade theUnited States of America    to provide aircraft,particularly fighters, as soon as possxbleand in large numbers, including those fromstocks now held by the United states army and Navy.(ii)   Measures should be taken to ensure the strictesteconomy in A.A. ammunition expenditure.(iii)    The most ruthless action should be takento eliminate any chances of &quot;Fifth Column&quot;activities.      Internment of all enemy aliens and all members of subversiveorganisations, which latter should be prescribed.(iv)    Alien refugees are a most dangerous source of subversive activity.     We recommendthat the number of refugees admitted tothis country should be cut to the minimum and that those admitted should be kept under the closest surveillance.(v)   In order to ensure the necessary co-operation&quot;between the Civil and Military authorities,operational control of all Civil DefenceB&apos;orccSj including county and borough police,etc.,  should be vested in the Ministry ofHomo Security and exercised through RegionalOommissioners.(vi)   Any evacuation which the Government intends to carry out in emergency should be carriedout now.     We recommend that a modification of the scheme for reception areas, in view of the dangers of invasion,should be carried out.

(vii)    Immediate steps to be taken t*obtain destroyers and M.T,Bs. fromthe United States of American(viii)   Every possible measure should be directed to obtaining the active support of eire, particularly with a view to the  immediate use of Berehaven.(ix)     Our intelligence system to be strengthenedwith a view to getting early warning of German preparations for invasion ofthis country,,(x)     Dispersal of stocks of raw materials to free our West Coast ports to dealwith the heavy increase in l&amp;pofta -should now bo made.(xi) So far as is practicable distribution offood reserves throughout the country with a view to meeting the disorganisation of transport which may occur.(xii) Bunkering facilities and other arrangementsnecessary to deal with a heavy volumeof merchant shipping in West C^ast and irish ports should be organised.(xiii)   All unimportant and luxury imports to be cut out.(xiv)   Finally we consider that the time has cometo inform the public of the true dangersthat confront us and to educate them on what they are required to do and what NOT to do,  if the country is invaded.(Signed)    C.L.N.
