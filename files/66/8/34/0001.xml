naval SITUATION.General Review.ITALY entered the war against us at midnight lOth-llth June.The evacuation of Narvik has been completed and the bulk of the forces have now reached the United Kingdom.H.M.S.. Glorious and other units have been sunk.The German advance along the French coast made further evacuation oftroops necessary.There has been increased U-boat activity, and magnetic mining by enemy aircraft.Northern Waters.2. The forces detached to search for the two unknown ships reported onthe 5th June (paragraph 11 of Resume No. 40) searched the area east and southof Iceland assisted by Sunderland aircraft. Two ships were again reported off thesouth of Iceland on the 7th June, but nothing was sighted by our forces, and theoperation was discontinued on the 9th June.3. The evacuation of the Narvik force was completed and all forces were on their way to the United Kingdom by the evening of the 8th June. Themaximum possible quantity of material was removed, and all fighters, includingthe Hurricanes, were successfully flown on to the carriers by R.A.F. personnel. Thetwo main groups of transports have now reached the United Kingdom. H.M.S.Devonshire brought His Majesty the King of Norway and the Crown Prince tothis country.4. A German naval force, which, according to the German wireless, included the battle cruisers Gneisenau and Scharnhorst, on the 8th June encountered and sank H.M. Ships Glorious, Acasta and Ardent, the empty troop transportOrama and the tanker Oil Pioneer. There is no definite information regardingcasualties, but the German wireless reported that there were several hundredsurvivors. The hospital ship Atlantis, which met H.M.S. Valiant on the 9th June,reported that she had seen a large warship open fire on a transport on the previousmorning about 300 miles to westward of Narvik; it would appear that this was probably the end of the Orama.5. On the 10th June the presence at Trondhjem of one German battle-cruiser, at least two cruisers (including one 8-inch) and some destroyers was established by air reconnaissance. These forces were attacked by R.A.F. air-craft on the 11th June, when direct hits were observed on each of the cruisers,and a supply ship was also thought to be hit. A further attack was made inthe early morning of the 13th June by 15 Skuas from H.M.S. Ark Royal,escorted by five R.A.F. Blenheim fighters. A hit with a 500-lb. bomb was obtained on the battle cruiser. The weather was foggy, Ark Royal ran into fog whenlanding on, and eight Skuas failed to return. The enemy claimed to have shot down four.^^^t^^-BUM^S. Vandyck was sunk off Harstad on the 10th June, it is believed by/ a torpedo; five of her crew are missing and six slightly wounded.Home Waters.French Coast.6. On the 7th and 8th June H.M. Destroyers Wanderer and Vesper carriedout an indirect bombardment of the main road from Abbeville to Treport, but after noon on the 8th June failure of communications made further firingdangerous.French ships evacuated base personnel from Havre on the night ofthe 9th-10th June. The evacuation of 11,000 troops was completed without opposition during the night of the 12th-13th June, the main body of the troops were sent to Cherbourg and the beach parties returned to Portsmouth.Havre was without light or water from noon the 11th June, and was reportedin flames in the early morning of the 13th June.Blocking and demolition operations were carried out at Dieppe on the10th June. One of the three block ships was sunk by mine in the approach andthe blockage is not complete.
7. On the 10th June destroyers and light forces operated off St. Valery, insupport of the 51st Division. H.M. Destroyers Bulldog and Boadicea were damaged by bombs, and H.M. Destroyer Ambuscade by fire from a shore batteryat Fecamp. Fog, which closed down after the small ships assembled for theoperation had been driven to seaward by shell fire and air attack, interfered withattempts to evacuate troops on the night of the llth-12th June. In consequenceit was only possible to take off 1,500 British and French troops. H.M. DestroyerHarvester embarked men from Veules (north-east of St. Valery) under particu-larly difficult conditions. The strong support provided by the Royal Air Forceundoubtedly prevented severe losses during this operation.Other Operations in Home Waters.8. Enemy M.T.Bs., apparently operating from Ymuiden and the Hook of holland, attacked the Downs guardship Holdfast on the night of the 6th-7th June,and a northbound convoy escorted by H.M.S. Vivien off Orfordness in the earlyhours of the 10th June. Neither of these attacks was successful, although in thelatter at least seven torpedoes were fired.Five M.T.Bs. in Boulogne on the 12th June were successfully attacked by aircraft, one being sunk and two damaged. British M.T.Bs. operating offYmuiden and Boulogne failed to make contact with the enemy.9. H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Carinthia when on patrol 80 miles N.W.of Ireland was torpedoed by a submarine in the afternoon of the 6th June. Shewas taken in tow by noon on the 7th, but sank that evening. Two officers and2 men were killed by the explosion; the remainder of the crew (about 300) were taken off by vessels sent to her assistance.On the morning of the 13th June H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Scotstounwas torpedoed and sunk by a U-Boat off Barra Head; 2 officers and 4 men are missing.The Polish submarine Orzel has failed to return from patrol and must be presumed to have been lost.H.M. Trawler Sisapon was mined and sunk off Harwich on the morning ofthe 12th June. No&apos;details of casualties have been reported.Mediterranean. .   .10. Since the entry of Italy into the war the Mediterranean Fleet has been engaged in a sweep in tne Eastern Mediterranean.H.M.S. Calypso was torpedoed and sunk by an enemy submarine in theEastern Mediterranean on the 13th June.   One officer and 38 ratings are missing.Enemy warships in Tobruk were bombed by the R.A.F. on the 12th June. a ship, believed to be the old Italian coast defence ship San Giorgio, was set on fire and had to be beached; another ship and the naval jetty were set on fire.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. Nine British ships and one fishing vessel have been sunk during theperiod, a total of 43,000 tons. In addition, three ships, of 20,000 tons total, havebeen damaged by submarine attack. Of the sinkings, two ships (5,000 tons) were sunk by U-Boat, four ships (10,000 tons) were mined, one ship (3,000 tons) anda fishing vessel were sunk by aircraft, and two ships (25,000 tons) by surface ship.In addition, two small Belgian ships and a Greek vessel were, sunk by mine,and a Finnish vessel was sunk by U-boat.Details are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. A total of 697 ships, including 86 Allied and 29 neutral, were convoyedduring the week without loss. Eight armed merchant cruisers, 6 destroyers and17 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties. Since the start of the war24,697 vessels (including 1,649 Allied and 3,192 neutral) have been convoyed, ofwhich 32 or 1 in 771 have been lost.Imports to the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 8th June were 1,201,535 tons, the highest total for any week since October.[21406] b
Oil and petrol imports in 45 tankers were 522,635 tons, of which 56,687 tons were for France. Mineral imports were 222,577 tons, cereals were 16,589 and other food imports, 111,152 tons, of which 35,053 tons was sugar.Anti-Submarine Operations.13. No promising attacks have been carried out in Home Waters during theperiod, but three are reported from the Mediterranean as follows : 10thJune. North of Sollum by H.M.S. Decoy. Submarine was hunted and attacked during the night and a large patch of oil was seen at daylight.12th June. Off Malta by H.M.S. Diamond. This attack was probablysuccessful.12^ June. Off Ceuta by H.M.S. Watchman. It is believed that thesubmarine may have been sunk or badly damaged.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.14. During the week the 5th June to the 12th June magnetic mines havebeen dropped off Portsmouth, Portland, Poole, the Needles, Dover, Harwich andthe Humber, and in the Thames Estuary. Minelaying has also been suspectedoff coastal headlands.Le Havre, Cherbourg, Dieppe, Ovistreham (the port of Caen) and St. Malohave also been closed for varying periods on account of magnetic mines.15. Two ships of the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla fitted with LL sweeps,Bramble and Speedy, exploded 3 mines in the Moray Firth. The whole area hasbeen thoroughly searched.Mines exploded by LL sweeps now number 112, the total of magnetic minesdealt with being 246, the number of contact mines is 406.Ten Minesweeping Drifters are to be converted to LL sweepers. Four WhaleCatchers under the Norwegian Flag are also to be equipped with LL sweeps.16. A new contact minefield has been found in the war channel about12 miles S.E. of Flamborough Head. The mines are reported to be Dutch, and asthe channel is in constant use they must have been laid only a few hours before they were discovered. A dangerous area was declared, and clear water found tothe westward, through which convoys are being swept.Fishing is now prohibited in certain areas in the North Sea where it wasformerly allowed, and inshore fishing off the greater part of the East and Southcoasts is restricted to daylight hours only. The gaps left for fishing vesselsthrough the East Coast Mine Barrier have been cancelled.Information has been received from a moderately reliable source that, afterthe of the United States relief ship, the enemy would attempt mine-laying round the Irish coast.Mediterranean.17. It is reported from a moderately reliable source that the Italians have laid minefields at Tobruk and Benghazi. They have declared the Sicilian Channel,between Sicily and Africa, to be mined and advise neutral ships to use the straits of Messina. On the 6th June the Italians declared that the waters within12 miles of the coasts of Italy, Albania, the Italian colonies and possessions weredangerous to navigation.British Minelaying.18. H.M.S. Teviot Bank and H.M.S. Plover laid 340 mines in the east coast Barrier on the 6th June and a further 340 on the 10th June. There hasbeen some minelaying by aircraft.Casualties to Naval Personnel.19. Apart from H.M. Ships Glorious, Acasta and Ardent, which betweenthem carried 92 officers and 1,393 men, casualties reported during the weekwere: Officers : 3 killed, 2 missing, 2 wounded.Men: 4 killed, 9 missing, 2 wounded.
Enemy Naval Intelligence.German.20. There are considerable numbers of Merchant Vessels in Bergen and inthe fjords between Bergen and Trondheim.The number of U-Boats at sea appears to have increased and it is believedthere is at least one in the Western Approaches and two off Finisterre and submarine patrols possibly exist between the Orkneys and Norway and the shetlands and Faroes.Italian.21. The disposition of the Italian Fleet at the outbreak of hostilities isbelieved to have been as follows : Taranto-4 battleships, 3 eight-inch cruisers, 2 six-inch cruisers, 26 destroyers,9 M.T.Bs. and 22 submarines.Messina 3 eight-inch cruisers, 4 six-inch cruisers, 9 destroyers, 7 T.Bs. and submarines.Palermo 2 six-inch cruisers.Naples -4 six-inch cruisers, 4 destroyers, 3 T.Bs. and 10 submarines.Spezia 1 eight-inch cruiser, 9 destroyers, 9 T.Bs. and 25 submarines.Cagliari ;7 submarines.Trieste ?1 battleship.Augusta 9 T.Bs. and 8 submarines.Tobruk 3 destroyers and 9 submarines.The Dodecanese 2 destroyers, 4 T.Bs. and 8 submarines.The Red Sea-7 destroyers, 3 T.Bs. and 8 submarines.Since the outbreak of hostilities unidentified surface units have been reported80 miles north of Derna (Libya) and 50 miles west of Cephalonia (Ionian Islands).Three Zara-class cruisers, with 6 destroyers, were sighted by H.M.S. Orpheus70 miles north-east of Malta at noon of the 12th June.One more submarine is believed to have reached Tobruk and one Cagliari.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.22. The first German merchant ships to fetch ore from Lulea in Swedenare reported to have arrived there on the 23rd May. The average size of the ships is 3,000 tons, and they are now leaving at the rate of two a day. Danish and norwegian shipping may be being used for this purpose.Four German merchant ships which had taken refuge in Naples sailed from there on the 8th June, probably bound for a port in the Adriatic, tne Ingo[21406] B 2
(3,950 tons) arrived at Trieste on the 3rd June, probably from Yugoslavia. the maritza (2,910 tons), reported to have sailed from Trieste on the 7th June, was probably going to Yugoslavia for bauxite.It is reported that the Germans are refusing to hand over the Augsberq(6,512 tons) to the Dutch, acting under the orders of the German Consul. Theship, which is at Dairen, was transferred from the German to the Dutch fWafter the outbreak of war and the transfer was recognised by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. The Scharnhorst (18,184 tons) is said to be leaving Kobe forYokohama in the middle of June.At Antofagasta, in Chile, the Rhakotis (6,753 tons) is endeavouring to obtain700 tons of Diesel oil. At present there are no supplies, but by the 15th june the oil may be available.The Arauca (4,400 tons), which is at Port Everglades, in Florida, is reportedto have received 500 tons of fuel oil.The Dutch are overhauling the Este (7,915 tons), Henry Horn (3,164 tons)and the Vancouver (8,269 tons), at Curacao, and making them ready for sea.Italian.23. When Italy declared war on the 10th June, there were 16 Italianmerchant ships in British Home Waters totalling 81,083 tons. Four of these were at Liverpool, three in the Tyne, one at Hartlepool, one at Cardiff and one atImmingham being repaired after being bombed by German aircraft in March.All these were seized. Five sailed from the Tyne on the 9th June or early onthe 10th June, but they were all captured and sent to Methil. One sailed fromSunderland on the 9th June and when intercepted the next day off Peterheadshe scuttled herself, but was beached.By midday, the 15th June, 21 merchantmen were known either to havescuttled themselves or else to have been seized in British Colonial or Dominionports. These total 119,962 tons. Four ships at Gibraltar attempted to scuttlethemselves, but it was done in such shallow water that they can be salvaged; oneof these was a tanker. Another tanker at Gibraltar scuttled herself successfully.Only one ship is known so far to have been seized there. Three ships have been captured in the Mediterranean. At Port Said one ship was seized and was foundto have 800 tons of ammunition on board. Two unsuccessful scuttlings are reported from Aden, but one ship scuttled herself successfully at &quot;Port Sudan.Calcutta, Fremantle and Capetown each report the seizure of a ship. One shiptried to escape from Montreal, but was intercepted, set herself on fire and wasbeached. A tanker was denied permission to cross the outer bar at Maracaibo,Venezuela, and later, when a French Naval Auxiliary attempted to board her,she tried to scuttle herself and was beached. Another unsuccessful scuttling isreported from near Durban, but one total loss occurred in the Pacific. At Maltatwo ships, the Calitea (4,013 tons) and the Rodi (3,220 tons), which wereevacuating Italians, were seized on the afternoon of the 11th June. Subsequentlythe Calitea was released, having on board 550 passengers, consisting principallyof old men, women and children. The internment of enemy aliens in Malta isnot easy.During the first two and a half days of War Italy is thus known to have lost 131,045 tons of merchant shipping, and this figure does not include seizuresmade at other Allied ports.24. There are 30 merchant ships of a total of 160,575 tons now on thehigh seas whose approximate positions are known of these, 16 ships of89,166 tons (including 10 tankers) are presumed to be bound for the Straits of gibraltar.Three of Italy&apos;sbig liners, the Rex (51,062 tons), the Roma (30,816 tons), andthe Augustus (30,418 tons) are in Italian ports. The Conte di Savoia (48,502tons) sailed from Genoa on the 4th June for an unspecified destination, which isprobably Pola. The Saturnia (24,470 tons) called at Naples on the 8th June.The Conte Grande (23,861 tons) arrived at Santos on the 9th June. The ConteBiancamano arrived at Balboa on the 6th June.It was estimated on the 10th May that the positions were, known of nineItalian potential Armed Merchant Cruisers. Two of these have since been seizedby the British, four are in Italian ports in the Red Sea, two off the Somalilandcoast, and one in Lourenco Marques in Mozambique.
MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.28. The German offensive launched on the 5th June on the front from st. Valery to Laon has made steady progress in the face of determined opposition by numerically inferior Allied forces. Three German army groups appear tohave been employed.29. The first enemy thrust over the Somme south and south-westwards fromAmiens, with two armoured divisions on its west flank, succeeded in reaching theline of the Seine and Oise. This was immediately followed by a correspondingthrust in the centre, southwards towards Soissons, which reached the Marne atChateau-Thierry. The main thrust, including four armoured divisions, developedon the 11th June on the Aisne between Rethel and Neufchatel (north of Reims).In this sector the enemy have reached the Marne at Chalons.30. On the 6th June 51 Division were holding a front of 15 miles on theRiver Bresle from Gamaches to the sea. A composite regiment of one armoured division was in support, the remainder of the Armoured Division having with-drawn South of the River Seine to refit. A composite division of L. of C. troops under Brigadier Beauman was holding the crossings over the River Bethune.31. After three days&apos; fighting 51 Division withdrew along the coast to theline of the River Bethune, with one brigade of Beauman&apos;s Division in support.Meanwhile, the remainder of Beauman&apos;s Division and one Armoured Divisionwithdrew south of the River Seine to reform.32. On the 11th June the position of 51 Division and French IX Corps was becoming critical. Two brigades of 51 Division were sent back, to :assist theJ^10^ *n Preparing a bridgehead to cover Le Havre. The remainder, with partof French IX Corps, were surrounded at St. Valery. Evacuation during the nightHth-12th June was held up by fog, and on the 12th June the force at St. Valerycompelled to surrender. During the night the 12th-13th June approximately11,000 Allied troops were evacuated from Le Havre and landed at Cherbourg.Economic Warfare.25. Only small quantities of goods have been seized in prize during theweek being parts of cargoes of nine ships (including six Italian) out of a totalof twenty-five ships dealt with by the Contraband Committee. Sixteen ships, ofwhich nine were Italian, were detained for enquiry.U.S.S.R.Baltic.26. Naval activity in the Baltic continues, and an analysis of recent move-ments suggests a considerable concentration of ships off the Estonian and Latviancoasts from Baltiski to Libau and off the Finnish coast.A Soviet minelayer was reported last week leaving Libau with a full loadof mines, and there have been reports of destroyers leaving that port also loaded with mines.The significance of this increased activity is not clear, but the Soviet may betaking all possible precautions against an attack on the Baltic States. Recentpolitical moves in those States point the same way.Several reports have been received recently that the uncompleted hull of a cruiser, either Lutzow or possibly Leipzig class, has been seen under tow in theBaltic, off the Estonian coast. It is considered that she may be now in Kronstadtor Leningrad. If this is true, it suggests that previous reports, that the russians had exchanged submarines for a cruiser with Germany, are substantiated.Baltic-White Sea Canal. .   .27. Up to the 6th June no ships other than Soviet merchant vessels entered the Canal. It is considered improbable that the U.S.S.R. would permit the useof the Canal by German warships, firstly because she does not wish to facilitate the German grip on Northern Scandinavia, and secondly because she is not anxious for any foreign Power to become too well acquainted with the Canal.
33. Leading elements of 52 Division began landing in France on the8th June, and moved forward at once to their concentration area. On the12th June 157 Brigade moved up into the line with French X Army, where itsarrival had great moral effect. General Headquarters under Lieutenant-GeneralBrooke arrived on the 12th June.Norway.34.   The Allied forces in the Narvik area were evacuated during the periodtihe 2nd-8th June, and the first troop convoy has arrived in the United Kingdom.The evacuation was carried out in four phases.Phase 1. Consisted in despatching surplus and valuable stores in ships which were in the Narvik area when the order to evacuate was received.The last of these ships sailed on the 1st June.Phase 2. Fast passenger and M.T. ships embarked troops evacuated from the Bodo area, vehicles, guns and further valuable stores, and sailedindependently for the United Kingdom between the 2th June and the5th June.Phase 3. 15,000 troops and the bulk of remaining stores were embarkedand sailed for the United Kingdom on the 6th June.Phase 4.-Eemaining personnel (approximately 10,000) were embarkedduring the nights 6th-7th and 7th-8th June and sailed on the 8th June.The final convoy is expected during the night the 13th-14th June. Theevacuation was completed without loss; during the early stages weather condi-tions were favourable and the expected enemy interference from the air did not materialise.Italy and Italian Possessions.35. Since the Italian declaration of war, there has been little informationof any active military operations except for the three following minor incidents:(a) the demolition of the frontier bridge at Ventimiglia on the Franco-italian frontier; (b) a minor encounter at Sidi Omar on the Egyptian-Libyan frontier,of which no details are known except that two Italians officers were captured;and (c) an attack on a French frontier post in the Sahara.There have also been unconfirmed reports of the possibility of certain Italianformations being employed under the German command on the Western Front.Mediterranean and Middle East.36. Malta. Malta was bombed at dawn and sunset on the 11th June.No damage was caused to vulnerable points, though barracks and civilian propertysuffered. Approximately 7 military and 30 civilians were killed, and 7 militaryand 127 civilians wounded. During the day there were enemy reconnaissancesover the Island. Three aircraft were brought down, two by -A.A. fire, one bya Gladiator, and one more by A.A. fire unconfirmed. On the 12th June one enemy aircraft on reconnaissance is believed to have been destroyed by A.A. fire.The conduct of the civilian population was admirable.37. Aden.-Enemy raided Little Aden on night the llth-12th June, pre-sumably in error for Aden.   Little damage was done.38. Cyprus. Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, gave orders for remainder of the Sherwood Foresters to proceed to Cyprus forthwith on the 7th June. Thiswill bring the garrison up to one battalion of British infantry.39. Sudan. Three Italian aircraft bombed Kassala, the 12th June, and caused 9 civilian casualties.  There was no other activity along the Sudan frontier.40. East Africa. The following South African Troops have now arrived in Kenya:  1 Field Regiment.1 A.A. Battery and Lights.1 Field Ambulance.
41. Egypt.-7 Armoured Division (less one Armoured Brigade in Cairo)has moved towards the Libyan frontier and now covers Sidi Barrani from theWest. A minor encounter at Sidi Omar, an Italian fort on the border, resultedin the capture of two Italian Officers.42. Somaliland. Air reconnaissance discovered no enemy in the north-westcorner of the Protectorate. Demolitions have been effected by the Allies on theJibuti Railway, and on roads leading towards Jibuti and Zeilah.The Balkan States.43. In Greece it is officially stated that the strength of the army exceeds130,000 and that arrangements have been made to increase the garrison of Crete(one infantry division) to war strength at a few hours&apos; notice. Measures are also being taken to speed up mobilisation so that the army can be placed on a warfooting in two days.44. In view of her weakness in equipment and her position with potentialenemies on most of her frontiers, Yugoslavia has not taken any spectacular steps as a result of Italy&apos;s entry into the war. Her sympathy for the Allied cause has,however, been officially confirmed, and it is believed that her army, which has been strengthened recently, may serve to contain a number of Italian divisions.Far East.45. The capture of Ichang and Shasi by Japanese forces marks the firstmaterial extension of their sphere of influence in China since the capture ofNanning in November 1939.Ichang is of considerable economic importance; it lies at the entrance to theYangtze gorges and is, therefore, the point from which the whole of the LowerYangtze shipping can be controlled.AIR SITUATION.General Review.46. The air operations of both sides have been very largely confined to thesupport of land operations, and bombing has, consequently, been mainly&quot; oncommunications. The enemy continues to employ large quantities of aircraft forclose support, and our medium bombers have also been used extensively, andwith considerable effect, against targets in the battle area. Weather has, onthe whole, been bad, and air fighting has been restricted. Attacks on Germanyhave, however, been continued. Two extensive raids were made on this country,though with little effect, and enemy mine-laying has been intensified. Germanwarships have been attacked at Trondheim. The entry of Italy into the war was marked by air attacks on Northern Italy (which were hampered by bad weather), by most successful Royal Air Force operations in the Middle East andby Italian attacks on Malta, Aden and Bizerta.Air Defence of Great Britain.47. Wide-spread enemy raids were carried out over the Eastern Countieson the nights of the 6th/7th and 7th/8th June by about fifty aircraft on eachnight. On the 6th/7th June bombs were dropped near Cranwell, Driffield,Upwoodand other eastern aerodromes, and near steel works at Scunthorpe and-rrodingham, though this was probably not by design. On the following nightbombs fell near Mildenhall, Bircham Newton, Raynham and Cottesmoreaerodromes. Practically no harm was done to the aerodromes attacked, and the damage at Scunthorpe and Frodingham was not serious. There have been nofurther raids on land targets, although mine-laying aircraft have been active onmost nights, and there were reports of a ship being bombed off the East Coast onthe 10th/11th June. One of these mine-laying aircraft, a Heinkel seaplane,crashed in Suffolk on the night of the 7th/8th June, and the crew were killed.*juns and searchlights have been in action on several occasions, and searchlightpositions were machine-gunned without effect at Dover on the 8th/9th June.   In
the forenoon of the 12th June a Heinkel 111 flew over Sussex and Kent, andwas shot down by Spitfires off the North Foreland. During the week 555 fightersorties were flown over England, but this combat was the only encounter withthe enemy.Western Front.48. The bulk of the bomber effort of both sides has been in support of land operations, communications have been extensively attacked and aircraft havebeen used to give direct support in the battle area at great intensity.49. As during the previous week, strong forces of fighters were maintainedover Northern France from bases in England, both to provide escort for our daybombers and for offensive patrols. Since the 10th June they have helped to coverevacuation at St. Valery and Le Havre. Air fighting was, however, less intensethan during any other period since the 10th May, largely on account of weather conditions. During the week, 852 sorties were flown, and enemy losses were39 confirmed and 21 unconfirmed; 18 of our fighters are missing.50. Bomber Command has continued its effort in support of the B.E.F.and of the left wing of the French army; pressure was also maintained on rail and other communications in the enemy&apos;s rear. Aircraft of the Command carriedout 14 reconnaissances in addition to 337 day and 522 night bombing sorties in operations on the Western Front and against Germany : 23 of our aircraft were lost and 4 German fighters were shot down. Day bombing was carried outalmost entirely in the area between the Somme and the Seine, and has been successfully directed against columns of tanks and motorised troops, againstbridges and focal points of communication, and against petrol supply andammunition dumps. Considerable resistance has been met from fighters andfrom ground fire. The greater part of the night-bombing effort was directed against important points on the whole length of the enemy&apos;s communications from the marshalling yards of the Rhineland to the Somme. Specially important points were communications round Amiens, the railhead at Hirson, the crossingsof the Meuse, and the junctions and yards at Aaachen, Duren, Euskirchen andRheydt. Fires and explosions followed many of the attacks, and extensive damage appears to have been done, in particular, by firing woods which concealedparked vehicles and supply dumps. Only two aircraft failed to return, butseveral others crashed or were damaged on landing in this country.51. Some of the squadrons of the A.A.S.F. have again been compelled tomove their aerodromes and, though communications have not been interrupted,:the information available is not sufficient to make it possible to give completestatistics. The three fighter squadrons have been more heavily engaged than thefighters based on England, and have shot down at least eight enemy aircraft(confirmed) and six (unconfirmed); very large formations of enemy fighters havebeen met and our own losses have been fairly heavy. The Battle squadrons havealso been heavily engaged over a wide area, by day and night, and have flownan average of 30-40 sorties a day. Enemy columns on the march have providedvery exposed targets, and attacks have been made repeatedly on the crossingsof the Somme and Seine. The Laon district has been raided more than once and a petrol dump was blown up near the town on the night of the 6th/7th June;communications near Trier have also been attacked and enemy aerodromes havebeen raided at Laon, Trier and Guise. On the 6th/7th June one of our aerodromes was bombed as a formation was about to take off, and four aircraft were damaged. No other attacks on our aerodromes appear to have been effective,and enemy fighter opposition has not been strong; on the 7th June a formationof twelve Battles shot down one Me. 109 (confirmed) and three other fighters(unconfirmed) without loss.- Twelve of our own aircraft are missing. Aconsiderable number of reconnaissance sorties have also been flown.Attacks on Germany.52. In addition to the interruption of communications which has alreadybeen mentioned, attacks have been continued on industrial targets in Germany.On the night of the 6th/7th June eighteen Hampdens were despatched to attack
oil targets at Hamburg and Ostermoor, and on the 7th/8th June 24 Hampdensattacked similar objectives at Hanover. On both these raids substantial damage is believed to have been done to. the main target, and successful attacks were also made on enemy aerodromes in North Germany and on the Frisian Islands.North Sea and Coastal Operations.53. Operations in the Southern part of the North Sea have been of lessintensity than during the previous period, though a good deal of work was donein the earlier part of the week in the search for stragglers of the force evacuated from Dunkirk, and for enemy M.T.B&apos;s. Numerous attacks were made on enemyM.T.B&quot;s and during the night the 12th/13th June Boulogne Harbour was raidedby six Hudsons in co-operation with aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm, when Unemployment.T.B. was probably destroyed and two others damaged. Direct hits were obtained on five barges and also on railway sidings and tracks near the harbour.54. Heavy units of the enemy&apos;s fleet have been active in the North and, inconsequence of rumours that the Germans had landed in Iceland, an air reconnaissance was carried out by a Sunderland on the 8th June, but nothing was found. The Norwegian Coast was also repeatedly searched and on the 10th JuneScharnhorst and other enemy warships were seen in Trondheim and MontjhamFjords and a considerable number of merchant ships at various points along thecoast. The aerodrome at Voss was seen to be nearing completion, but recon-naissance for other new aerodromes revealed no important developments. Oneof our aircraft bombed oil tankers and the oil refinery at Thamshaven and setthem on fire.55. On the 11th June a morning reconnaissance by three Blenheims found the enemy forces still in Trondheim Fjord and, as already described, they were attacked by twelve Hudsons, which dropped a salvo of bombs in pattern over the target. It is believed that the two cruisers and the large merchant vessel were hit.One Hudson was hit by an anti-aircraft shell and another was shot down by enemy fighters; the rest returned safely. One aircraft bombed the wireless station atUtsire and scored a near miss, which damaged the wireless hut. (Anothersuccessful attack was made against the ships on the night of the 12th/13th Juneby aircraft from H.M.S. Ark Royal.)56. On the night of the 8th-9th June eight Beauforts of Coastal Commandattacked the oil depot at Ghent, which had previously been damaged; numeroushits were made and large fires were started. On the night of the 12th-13th Junea sortie was made by twelve Hudsons to attack targets round Bergen. Three hits were secured on anti-aircraft batteries and one on a merchant vessel in the Fjord.On the same night four Beauforts attacked the aerodrome at Vaernes, and scoreddirect hits on aircraft and barracks.57.   Minelaying was carried out nightly throughout the week.58. During the week 210 routine and 293 special patrols were flown by coastal Command and there were 117 sorties for convoy escort; our losses amounted to ten aircraft.59. As described in the Naval Situation, during the evacuation of Narvikall our remaining fighters, including the Hurricanes, were successfully flown onto H.M.S. Glorious.  All were, of course, subsequently lost.Attacks on Italy.60. During the night the llth-12th June twelve Wellingtons were detailedto operate against objectives in North Italy from aerodromes in SouthernFrance, but the operation was cancelled. Thirty-six Whitleys operated from thiscountry, refuelling at Jersey en route. Bad weather conditions were encountered,and fifteen aircraft returned without bombing, on account of technicaltrouble or because they failed to identify their targets; one Whitley is missing.Of the remainder, nine bombed Turin and two Genoa. Both towns werebrilliantly illuminated, although Turin was blacked out at the approach of the bombers; anti-aircraft fire at Turin was intense, but extremely inaccurate. TheAnsaldo works and the docks were hit at Genoa; at Turin the main objective wasthe Fiat works, and great damage was caused to buildings and to railway.ae.ar.by.&apos;[21406] : c
Middle East.61. Three Blenheim squadrons began operations from Egypt as soon as war was declared at midnight the lOth-llth June. The Tobruk-Sollum area of libya was reconnoitred at dawn and no troop concentrations were found; therewere some ships in harbour at Tobruk. A low attack was made on the air base at El Adem, where a large concentration of aircraft was found; extensive damage was caused to petrol stores and to enemy aircraft, and the attack was repeatedby another Blenheim squadron in the afternoon. Opposition from grounddefences and fighters was very slight; one of our aircraft is missing, and anothercrashed on returning to its base. At the same time, an attack was launched byWellesley aircraft based on Port Sudan against the enemy&apos;s aerodromes and supply depots in Eritrea; complete surprise was achieved, and great damage was done at Assab during the morning. Massawa was attacked with equal successlater in the day.  One aircraft was brought down by anti-aircraft fire.62. Aircraft based on Aden carried out a photographic reconnaissance ofDiredawa, Jijiga, Harrar and Assab, and identified targets there; the southernend of the Red Sea was also reconnoitred for enemy naval activity. Four bombers of No. 12 Squadron, South African Air Force, operated from Kenya against enemytransport lines near Moyale on the Kenya frontier; direct hits were seen and no opposition of any kind was encountered.63. On the 12th June thirty-two Blenheims again attacked Tobruk, in face of considerable opposition. One large ship was set on fire and beached, and thenaval pier and a ship alongside it were seen to be on fire. Reconnaissance was continued in the Aden area and offensive operations were begun; nine aircraft attacked Assab and secured hits on the power-house, petrol dump and barracks,while seven aircraft bombed Diredawa and hit an ammunition dump. There was some anti-aircraft fire at Diredawa, and two fighters took off at Assab, but no damage was done to our aircraft by enemy action; one Blenheim was lost?-64. Reconnaissance for enemy naval activity has been maintained in theMediterranean by Sunderlands based on Alexandria.65. Italian air attacks were made on Malta, Aden and Bizerta, as described in a subsequent section.French Air Operations.66. Detailed information of French air operations during the week is notavailable, but it is known that 1,116 fighter, 463 bomber and 95 reconnaissancesorties were made : 69 enemy aircraft were destroyed and 29 French aircraft lost.67. French fighters armed with shell-guns are reported to have been effective against German tanks. &apos;French Air Intelligence.68. Aircraft Industry-About 430 aircraft, including 100 trainers, were produced in France during April; it is reported on good authority that578 aircraft, including 155 trainers, were produced during May. It is, however,most unlikely that this rate of output can now be maintained.. An. importantaircraft factory at Meaulte, near Albert, has already fallen into enemy hands,and production is likely to be handicapped by the loss of the heavy industries of the North-East, where a large proportion of the necessary forgings andcastings were made. The smaller factories along the North bank of the Seine arealready in the battle front, and if Paris should fall a large part of the Frenchaero-engine industry will disappear, as well as a number of the importantairframe and aircraft component factories. It may, be possible for the factories in the South, West and Centre to continue the production of airframes, but itwill certainly be necessary to import engines for a large proportion of the aircraftproduced.German Air Operations.69. The scale of activity has;remained on much the same level as duringprevious &quot;weeks.   Attacks have continued on aerodromes and communications
South of the battlefront, and raids have been carried out as far South as ToursBourges andNevers. The series of raids on the Rhone Valley does not appear tohave been repeated but there have been continuous attacks on such Channel portsas remained in Allied hands. Aircraft continue to operate at great intensity inthe battle area, though the activity of the dive bomber formations has fluctuatedconsiderably, and there are indications of a withdrawal of some units from theWestern Front.70. Minelaying has continued in the Channel, and on the nights of the6th-7th and the 7th-8th June there were raids on aerodromes and other objectives in the east of England as already described.German Air Intelligence.71. In spite of the intensity of operations a high standard of serviceabilityhas been maintained, although units have not been able to maintain their fullestablishment of aircraft continuously in the line. It is probable that there havebeen certain difficulties in maintaining heavy bombers at aerodromes in the forward areas, and some units continue to operate from Germany. It is estimatedthat there are now about 550 fighters operating from landing grounds in the occupied territories. Some aircraft of one long range bomber unit have been carrying out operational training of some form on the Baltic Coast on two con-consectutive nights; this appeared to include co-operation with motor torpedo-boats.:72. It is estimated that 3.085 German aircraft have been lost or damagedbetween the 10th May and the 10th June; 2,038 of these losses have been confirmed!Italian Air Operations.73. As already mentioned, there were Italian air raids on Malta on the11th and the 12th June in considerable force. Three aircraft were shot down onthe 11th, one by a Gladiator, and one reconnaissance aircraft on the 12th. no damage appears to have been done to military objectives, but 32 civilians havebeen killed and 125 wounded. On the 12th June, there was an attempt to attackAden by aircraft based in Abyssinia, but the bombs were dropped a considerable distance from the town. Bizerta was raided on the same day, 40 people beingkilled and 60 injured.Italian Air Intelligence.74. About one-third of the total striking force of bombers is now con-centrated at Pisa, Modena, and Ravenna. The rest of&apos;the force has been moved to the south, and eight squadrons have been transferred from the mainland toSicily. Two newly-formed dive bomber squadrons and one ordinary bombersquadron are at Pantelleria. Libya has been reinforced by about 30 bombers andone fighter squadron. A certain number of civil aircraft have been taken oftnormal routes and are being overhauled and modified to act as troop carriers. Thetotal troop carrying capacity of all registered Italian civil aircraft is between,200 and 2,400.75. Twenty new Ghibli aircraft have been ordered for use in Libya, butdelivery appears to be delayed by a shortage of Alf a-R,omeo engines. Ghiblisare at present extensively used in the colony for the maintenance of communica-tions and supplies for advanced landing grounds. A further twelve fighters were due to reach Eritrea on the 2nd June, and it was expected that there would arriveon the same boat the machine guns for the last batch of bombers whichhad apparently arrived without armament. There have been a certain number ofbomb raids against rebels in. the Gondar district during the last week of May.Portugal.76. The Portuguese Government is reported to be somewhat anxious aboutthe Italian civil air base and personnel on the Island of Sal which has becomealmost an Italian colony. The ground installation of the aerodrome could probably be rendered unserviceable without difficulty by gunfire from a warship,but it would be hard.to do serious damage to the landing ground itself.[21406] c 2

Bulgaria.77. The Bulgarian Air Force is at present in a state of expansion and its future development depends on the supply of: aircraft promised by Germany. Itspaper strength is eight regiments, three of which are at present without aircraft.The present strength is about 18 squadrons, amounting to 215 aircraft, andthere are in addition a certain number of obsolescent types, now used for trainingwhich could be formed into squadrons if necessary. There are 54 knownaerodromes and landing grounds in the country, and many new sites have recentlybeen surveyed, but owing to climatic conditions most of them are not likely to beserviceable except in summer and autumn. It is reported that about 320 Germansentered the country during April and May under the aegis of the BulgarianGeneral Staff, and that German wireless transmitters are in operation near Sofiaand near Bourgas.Turkey.78. The Turkish Government have decided to increase the number of pilotpupils at the Flying Training School at Eskisehir from approximately 150, whichis the usual annual output, to 550. Of this increase of 400, 200 will be officersand 200 n.c.os. Candidates are being selected at once, and it is hoped to havethe full number under training very soon.79. A large expansion scheme for increasing the number of mechanics inthe Air Force is also taking place. At present the training centre has an annual output of between 30 and 40 officer and n.c.o. mechanics for the Turkish AirForce. To rectify the serious shortage, steps are being taken at once to train600 mechanics. These will be trained at the Flying Training School, Eskisehir,the Aircraft Depot, Eskisehir, and the Airframe Factory, Kaiseri, each centre of training taking 200 pupils.Afghanistan.80. The service of Russian courier aircraft between Tashkent and Kabulhas recently been increased from once in ten days to two services a week. the pilots are frequently changed, and about fifty different pilots have been employedduring the last three years.Iran.81. A new aerodrome is under construction at Pahlavi, on the Caspiancoast, 20 miles from Resht. Work on the runways is far advanced, but there areas yet no signs of the erection of buildings.Japan.82. The Japanese authorities have, announced that a regular weekly service between Tokyo and Bangkok is to be opened on the 14th June. The French refusal to permit flight over Indo-China has apparently been maintained, and it ispresumed that this regular service will follow the coastline and will be conducted with a civil version of the military four-engined flying boats. There are stillno indications to confirm the recent reports of large concentrations pf naval,military and air forces in the Island of Hainan. Considerable work is, however,being done on the long-term development of seaplane bases and aerodromes inthe island, which is the natural base for air attack on Southern China, FrenchIndo-China and Thailand.Netherlands East Indies.83. It is hoped to increase the strength of the Air Force by purchasing144 fighters, 108 dive bombers and 36 reconnaissance aircraft in the UnitedStates; this should be enough to produce 14 additional squadrons with 100 percent, reserve. Delivery of these aircraft is uncertain, but twenty Curtiss Hawkfighters are now being delivered against a previous purchase, and twenty-fourCurtiss interceptors, which had been ordered by the Netherlands, are now beingtaken over by the Netherlands East Indies.
