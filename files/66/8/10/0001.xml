Cummitte.e.aOn the 15th May the War Cabinet invited, us toconsider what action could usefully be taken on thefollowing suggestions which the Foreign Secretary hedput forward  .n view of the somewhat uncertain trend of portuguese policy -(a) that preparations should be made  &quot;or seizingstrategic points in the Cape Verde islands and the Azores in the event of trouble;(b) &quot; that the intelligence service in Portugalshould be strengthened;    and(c) that steps be taken to organise the Britishcommunities in Portugal both for intelligencepurposes and also for combined action in takeevent of civil disturbances.29 We have examined the strategic implications of portuguese intervention -;n the side of our enemies in the annex to this report      The measures we recommend are asfollows:-(a) The Azores and Cape Verde Islands are ofgreat strategic importance as potentialnaval and air bases, lying as they do onour trade routes from the South Atlantic.These islands and Madeira contain Britishcable stations.      The Italians have a civil air base in the Gape Verde Islands,,It is most important    that we should seizestrategic points in the Cape Verde islands and the Azores in the event of Portuguesehostility.      We are arranging for a detailed operational examination to becarried out9(b) There are many harbours in Portuguese island and colonial possessions which might beused by enemy surface raiders arid submarines.These would have t.o be kept underobservation

(c) The capture of the railway from the southern rhodesian frontier to the coast ofMozambique and of the Port of Beirawould be necessary to the Rhodesias for economic reasons.    This operation cculdprobably be best under-taken by a small force operating from Southern Rhodesia.The force required might however be beyondthe capacity of Southern Rhodesia toprovide, in which case we should have toask the Union Government to help.    Werecommend that this matter be taken upby the Dominions Office with the Governmentsof Southern Rhodesia and the Union ofSouth Africa,(d) The British-owned railway running from northern Rhodesia through the belgian congo into Angola is of some economic importance to the Rhodesias.    Thedifficulties of the country and the distanceinvolved are such that we do not recommendany military action in this area.(e) The Government of India would have to takeover Goa,- where there is a high poweredwireless station, and also Daman and Diu.The commitment.JLnvolv ed -would, be..negligible.(f) The Japanese&quot;have been offered concessions in Portuguese Timor (Malay Archipelago)0    a japanese descent on Timor, nominally toprotect the concessions, might be made if. Portugal entered the war and such a descentwould be prejudicial to our interests.Nevertheless we consider that we should on no account take any action in Timor ourselves in anticipation of Japanese action, as todo so might precipitate Japanese aggression.(g) We do not recommend any operations against the mainland of Portugal, wherr the acquisitionof bases by our enemies will not greatlyaffect the situation,  if Spain is alsohostile,(h) There should be an Intelligence Centre in portugal to collect and collate reports.    Wesuggest tha-t such a centre might be under&apos;&apos;the auspices of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy.(i) We suggest that H.M. Ambassador at Lisbon beasked how far he considers Britishcommunities in Portugal can be organised.The organisation of British communitiesabroad raises questions of general policy,in particular the. extent to which H.M.Representatives are to be consideredresponsible for such work,(Signed) T.S,V.PHILLIPS(V.C.N.S.)R.

A g H g XTHE STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS OF PORTUGUESE INTERVENTION ONTPIE SIDE OF GERMANY IN CQNJUliCTION WITH SPAIN AND ITALY.General.li It is unlikely that Portugal, however unfriendly a new government might &quot;be, would dare to take any overt action againstthe Allies except in conjunction with Spain and Italy.      In areoent appreciation on the implications of Spanish hostility(Paper No. C.b.S.(40)&apos;352(J.P. )) we indicated that the acquisition by our enemies of bases in Portugal would not be of muchadditional value to them, since the harbours and aerodromes of spain are sufficient to inset their needs in this area.     We do not recommend any action against the mainland of Portugal, therefore^in the event of Portuguese intervention against us.      Portugueseisland and colonial possessions will, however, affect ourstrategy in various ways and these are examined below.Economic.2. We are advised by the Ministry of Economic Warfare thatPortuguese hostility would have no serious effect on our war effort.     A point to which they draw attention, however, is theposition of the Rhodesias.      The only economical outlets for muchof the trade of Northern and Southern Rhodesia are through Angolaand Mozambique respectively, the latter being the more important.A British-owned railway company operates in Angola and the rhodesian railways operate the line from Beira to Salisbury.Operations in these areas are discussed in paras. 9 to 13 below, .Cape Verde Islands, Azores and Madeira.3. The Cape Verde Islands and the Azores occupy strategicpositions of great importance on the Atlantic trade routes between the,South Atlantic and the United Kingdom.     Madeira isof less importance in this respect.     With the Mediterraneanclosed,  these routes become of increased importance in particular the main focal point at Freetown Sierra Leone.     Enemy naval andair forces if established in the Cape Verde Islands and the azores would be in a position seriously to threaten our seac ommuni c a t i ons.4; The Italian commercial air line to South America has arefuelling base on the Island of Sal (Cape Verde Islands), andit is believed that Italy is&apos; making efforts to develop this basebeyond the normal requirements of a civil station.     As far as isknown,.Sal is at present - undefended, but Italian or Portuguesetroops c&quot;Ould presumably be flown there at any time,5* All the British submarine cables to the South Atlantic pass through St, Vincent (Cape Verde Islands), having previouslypassed through either Fayal (in the Azores) or Madeira.     Thereis also a British cable running through Fayal to the United states which affords an alternative to the direct route between Englandand America.These cables are in no case vital to our interests, but their loss would force on us an increase use of wireless tele-graphy and consequently some reduction in the security of messages,It would clearly be to our advantage to take possession of the cable stations in the Azores and Cape Verde.      The station inMadeira is not of great importance.6* It is therefore of great importance strategically that operations should be undertaken to deny the facilities Of the cape verde Islands and the Azores to the enemy.     Preparations forseizing strategic x^points in these islands in the event of troubleare already under consideration.

7, There are many harbours in the Azores and Cape VerdeIslands,  in Portuguese Guinea and the Islands in the Bightof Biafra which might he used by enemy surface raiders and submarines, and which would therefore need to be kept underobservation.8. As regards Portuguese defences, Hortawhore the FayeO. (Azores) cable&quot; station is situated is anundefended harbour .      Porto Grande,  the St. Vincent (cape verde) cable station, was defended during 1914-18, but the defences are believed to have fallen into disrepair.Portuguese garrisons are:-In the Azores    -   2 infantry battalions in Cape VerdeIslands -    2 light infantry companies2 mixed platoons, infantry and artillery.Subject to detailed examination we do not think thatthe capture of these cable stations should present much difficulty, provided no Spanish or Italian forces are admitted before the outbreak of war.      Their retention byus, which in our view would be necessary so long asPortugal remained hostile, would, however, call for asmall garrison in each group of islands.Mozambique9.        The economic importance  to Southern Rhodesia of &quot;tha.railway in Mozambique has already been pointed out*   Itwould be essential, we consider, to capture and hold therailway in Portuguese territory and the Port of Beira.The Portuguese garrison in Mozambique consists of some10 companies of infantry,2 native machine gun companies,1 light battery (motorised),1 squadron-of cavalry (motorised), and some500 police.In addition there are two native companies maintained in the Mozambique company&apos;s territoryo10.        The necessary operations could probably be most easilycarried out by a force operating from Southern Rhodesia.Little resistance need be expected and the force required would only be a small one.      The subsequent guarding of the150 mil.es of railway and control of the Port of Beira would,however,  involve the locking up of small forces on internal security duties.- The provision of these forces   wouldprobably be beyond the resources of Southern Rhodesia.      Ifthis proved to be the case, we suggest that the Union ofSouth Africa should be asked to assist.

11.        The---Unian^Government would probably also consider itaeceasary to take over control of the short length ofrailway running from the Transvaal frontier to Lorenco Marquesand that port*   This thuy should &quot;be able to do.without difficulty.12.        No operations other than those described above shouldbe necessary, since the capture of the two lengths ofrailway and the ports of Beira and Lorenco Marques would effectively control the economic life of Mozambique andwould almost certainly result in the cessation of furtherresistance. -Angola13,       The Portuguese forces in Angola consist ofIS companies of infantry1 machine gun company5-batteries, and about2500 reserves.Control of the British owned railway running from northern Rhodesia through the Belgian Congo into Angolawould be a difficult undertaking owing to the great.. distanceand difficult nature of the country..     Moreover,  this railway is relatively of much less importance to the rhodesias than that running to Beira.      We therefore do not recommend any operations in Angola.Portuguese Eastern Possessions14,       It would be necessary for the Government of India totike over Goa, where there is a high power wireless station;and they would presumably also take over Daman and Diu, theonly other Portuguese possessions in India.      The commitmentsinvolved would be negligible^15, The continuecu-c^oupatljn. of Macao (on the Canton River).,by the Portuguese is of no strategic importance,,16..       The Japanese &apos;,ave recently been showing considerable interest in the Portuguese portion of the Island of Timor(Malay Archipelago), where they have -been offered certain concessions.    If Portugal entered the war, we think it possible that Japan might &quot;protect&quot; Timor,,    This would clearly be prejudicial to our interestsc    Despite this, weshould make ho move against Timor in anticipation of Japaneseaction,, since it is no danger to us so long as it remains in portuguese hands, and action on our part might precipitate a move by the Japanese,,
