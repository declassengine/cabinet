ANNEX II.WAR CABINET.POOD POLICY COMMITTEE.AGRICULTURAL WAGES PROPOSALS.Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Ireasury,1.     &apos;   The object of the proposals is to retain existinglabour on the land and to facilitate an addition to thepresent permanent labour force of about 700,000 of a maximum of 100,000 regular workers apart from seasonal labour.      Theestimated cost to be borne by the consumer or the exchequer is about thirteen millions per annum.      It will introduce a violent change into British agriculture, and though it isadvocated as a necessary expedient to deal with blitzkrieg .conditions during the next few months, it should be realised that its effect on the national economy and on agriculture inparticular may be catatrosphic.(a) It is acutely inflationary.(b) On any economic basis the prices of agricultural products cannot support wages at the level nowproposed.     Either therefore there must sooner or later be a drastic readjustment which maybring ruin to farmers, or taxpayers and wage-earners generally must subsidise agriculture onan enormous scale.(c) The principle of subsidising low wages once adopted for one industry may well spread to others withan increasing inflationary effect.S. It should be observed that the expenditure is verylarge in relation to the prospective increase in che labour force.     The prospects of actually obtaining this accretionseem rather remote.      It is not clear whether the Lanisterof Labour contemplates that he will now be able to instructagricultural workers who are earning large wages in munition works to return to agriculture at 48s.It is surely also true that the proposal is contraryto the principle contained in the new Regulation 58(a), whichis that a man sent to a job shall be required to cake the ratefor the job irrespective of his present earnings.3. The question how the cost of the adjustment of pricesnecessary to recoup the farmers is to be met ha s not yet beenconsidered.     If it is proposed that the cost is to be borneto an appreciable extent by the Exchequer and not by theconsumer, it will clearly make more acute the question which isalready looming of whether it will be practicable to continue thepresent policy of holding retail food prices at an uneconomiclevel.a 18 0 R EqTcg.P.

Extract from the Conclusions of tha 15thMeeting of the Panfl;;Po&apos;i icy Com-.iit teTTSldon :30th May. 1940V  1ICULTU2ALIS PROPOSALS,CONSEQUENTIALBlBTilSMTS IN   .ERS&apos; RETURNS.3, :       The Committee had before them a Memorandum&quot;by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(Paper F*P.(M)(40) 67) submitting for- their concurrence the draft of a statement whica he-proposed to make on the subject of agricultural wages and consecjuentixl adjustments in farmers&apos;returns if the proposal contained in paragraph ii of his&apos; Memorandum (F,P..(M) (40) 53) was approved in principle by the Committee    id also, a memorandumby the Financial Secretary to the Treasury(F.P.(M)(4Q) 71)oJcage ,offormat i on *Attention was drawn to the faot that 0228th May the &quot;Drilya-rpress&quot; had mer.\iono.. tinproposals and that on the following lays   anynewspapers had referred to the suggestion the&quot;the agricultural minimum wage in Snglanc. andWales was raised to 40/- -  weekosej. A,   In the course of discussion it was pointedout that, the aetaila of tihese proposals had. been recently under discussion with the interestsdirectly concerned,; Reference hid also been nuidein general terms to the subject by the lilnisterof Labour and national Service in his recent discussions with Representatives of organised labour and in his statement to the Trade UnionExecutive (on the subject of orders for the controlof labour) in- tile course of which he had statedthat the imposing of obligations on agricultural workers must be done with decency and must be accompanied by steps to ensure greater equilibriumof the wage structure in rural area so
The Committee then discussed the proposals in the memoranda &quot;before them. In the course of discussion thefollowing points were raised:-(i) The Minister of Agriculture was faced withthe task of securing a substantial increasein agricultural production ...     He could not. achieve this unless the labour force of theindustry could be maintained and increased,,The Minister of Labour had agreed to assist in finding this labour-:.proyided;.that therewas some improvement in&apos; the: -p e&apos;sj6&apos;nt level of wage rates:.      In order .to...cover -this increasethere must be an increase in &quot;the &quot;returns    toproducersst which could only be made either by rai sing&apos;prices to the consumer or by an exchequer subsidy. - .       &apos;:(ii) The Minister of Labour was -,ab4Qut&apos; to exercisevery sweeping powers which. would., Involve -- &apos;. transferring workers back into., agriculturefrom more highly paid occupations&apos;, ;   Hehad discussed the whole problem with theUnions concerned and had secured their agreement in principle to,the s-steps proposed.His task would be eased if the disequilibriumwhich existed between wage- ratesvinagriculture on the one hand and.in ruralindustry on the other could be corrected.The standard of rural housing and- the rents . &apos;.:paid by the agricultural workers, were also&quot;an important factor- in the.situation.(iii) Attention    was drawn to the second-sentence in paragraph 2 of the proposed statement which made it clear that adjustments mustbe made to meet the special.conditions prevailing in Scotland.      The.first essential;,howevers was to define clearly the positionin regard to prices in order&apos;&apos;-that-farmersmight be in a position to. pay - increased wages,,      It should be remembered-&apos;-that the farming community in Scotland &quot;did notconsider that the present.schedule of pricesgave,an adequate return with wages at theirexisting level.THE CHJuTRMAN suggested that the discussion mightbe focussed on the following four questions:(a) Was it admitted that a1 substantial increasein agricultural production was required?(b) Was there any doubt that to secure such anincrease the labour force of the industry must be maintained and indeed increased?
(c) In order, to secure- such an increase, was there any alternative, method other than- raising of wages?. (d) If not2 could producers he, enabled to pay&quot;, &quot;v ..- .increased wages except either (i) through&apos; -   an Increase in prices, to the consumer 9 or(ii) - through- some form of subsidy from theExchequer?In the discussion which ensued the following further points were made;-      ; &apos;      ,.. . (i ) . 11 was suggested&apos;&apos;tha-c the Government might make use of their -Compulsory powers to. bring.. about an increase in the supply of agriculturallab our o      To this it was objected thatcompulsion alone would not give satisfactory results,, ;. . Labourers-\must&apos; be given a sufficientinducement if they were, to.work. well.(ii) Some discussion, took place ,on ,the -proposed figureof 48/-- for the minimum wageo      It was explainedthat this figure represented a compromise between. different suggestions made.s&apos; and. that it v/ouldin practice result in an average wage of about50/--J which would.be generally ,comparable with...-.- the wages paid in other rural occupations.    Onthe other hand it was urged that&apos;-the proposedfigure had-been successively increased from38/-&apos; to 42/- and subsequently to&apos; 48/-9 . and.-. . that the figure of  13 million for the &quot;totalcost was certain, to prove..-&amp; - considerableunderestimateov; -.      &quot;&quot; &apos;.&apos;-&apos;&quot;&apos;(iii) It was emphasised that the returns to farmersmust be sufficient to &quot;cover all their costs.At the same time prices mus-iTnct be. raised      ;.&apos;beyond a level- which&apos; the consumer.. would be willing to bear^    It followed that an increasein prices for certain;pr6ducts must be combined with a&apos;varying-degree of subsidy.    It would,..,be necessary.to work out some system whereby the subsidy would be apportioned between the producers of different products,,(iv) It was urged that the arguments in the Memorandumby. the&apos;Financial Secretary to the Treasury tookinsufficient account of the radical changes in-our pre-war economy which would be required in&apos;&apos;. . the present emergencyAgriculture was. a,,rootindustry and, it was necessary to establish anew. balance between it and other branches of rproduction.    The broad principle to be adoptedshould be to ensure that the essentials of lifewere available to the people in the quantitiesthey-required at prices &apos;ttiey could pay.    Inorder to;-secure.&apos; this; prices    should be stabi-_________Ixsedr,&quot;-except insofar as an,increase in theprice in the product- could be borne by certain .classes of - consumer u(v) It was suggested, that the redistribution of the.labour.force ana the readjustment of wages bothin agriculture and industry to. be- enforcedshortly by the. Ministry of - Labour would resultin a-considerable saving--on balance to theTreasury;    Excessive rates&apos; of wages werebeing paid.at presents for example9 in shadow
factories engaged on aircraft production.There would also he savings as a resultof increased output brought about byimprovements in the flow of production.(vi) It was suggested that the justification ofa subsidy for staple foodstuffs was that itwould avoid the necessity for wage increases.Negotiations were proceeding between the Ministerof Labour and the representatives of the workers.   and employers,      The Minister intended to makethe following proposals:-(a) That there should be a settlement of legitimateclaims outstanding at the time when the recentEmergency Powers Act was passed.(b) Contracts of service based on the cost of livingshould not, in general, be interfered with, butthe normal review of such contracts shouldbe suspended for the time being.     A national committee should be set up which should beasked to submit its first report in October next,and a subsequent report in February of the following year.     In this way it was hoped to secure somestability in the level of wages in the immediate; future.    The situation could be reviewed whenthe direction to be taken by the war becameplainer.     The Order which the Minister ofLabour-proposed, after discussion with the- Unions, to issue next week would; be comprehensive and would not deal-with the problems of any one particular industry.(vii) It was suggested that the revised schedule of prices to consumers and returns to producers might, legitimatelyprovide for an increase in the -price, not only ofluxury articles, but also of certain essential food-stuffs, the consumption of which would be. reducedby rationing.-      , 1In the course of the discussion summarised above THEFINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY said that the Chancellorof the Exchequer was unable to agree either to the proposal fora minimum wage of i+8/- or to the suggestion that the price of foodstuffs should be stabalised at the cost of the Exchequer.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR asked that, an early decision mightbe reached in view of the numerous appeals which were being 1addressed to him to stop the &quot;poaching&apos; of labour.THE MINISTER OF FOOD wished to make it clear that while he woulpass on to consumers as much as possible of the increased cost he could give no undertaking that he would be able topass on the whole of the increased returns to producers due tothis increase of wages.The Committee agreed:- -  - . &quot;-&quot;(a)     subject to the dissent of the Financial :secretary to the Treasury who reservedthe position of the Chancellor of theExchequer, to approve in principle theproposals in regard to agricultural wages,,.&apos; .&apos;\ and consequential adjustments in farmers&apos;re turns cont obtained in -the Memorandum; by the Minister of Agriculture and&apos;Fisheries (Paper No. F.P.(M)(I4.0) 67);
(b) to invite the Chairman to raise thisquestion for the decision of theWar Cabinet on the following day.(c) that should the War Cabinet approve theseproposals it would then be necessary forthe Tinister of Pood in consultationwith other ministers concerned to prepare proposals(i)    as to the adjustments requiredin the returns, to producers .of the various agricultural products and(ii)    as to the extent to which any increases in such returns shouldbe covered, by an increase inthe price to the consumer orby an Exchequer subsidy.
