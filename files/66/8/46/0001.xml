THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P. (hO) 216.22ND JUNE. I?h0copy no. y^war CABINET^balloons.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.We wish to increase the order for balloons to 20,000.That involves placing orders for raw materials;, for thefabrication thereof and for the manufacture of the balloons.The order will provide for an output of balloonsexceeding &quot;by more than 10,000 the requirements of the AirMinistry.For this reason we must have the authority of the&quot;Cabinet for our proposed action.We take this step because we &quot;believe that the AirMinistry&apos;s approved programme is inadequate.The Parliamentary Under Secretary for Air has informed us that, in the first half of June, the rate of wastage ofballoons reached a level of 7 per cent, a day, or 200 per cent,a month.With 2,000 &quot;balloons flying, this would call for the replacement of 4,000 balloons every month from new stock orrepairs.Even if this estimate of wastage were, considered toopessimistic, a total order for 20,000 balloons does not appearto he excessive.In November last year, the Air Ministry ordered 4,000balloons.      In April they gave a further order for 6,000balloons..     The plan of production was that this total outputof 10,000 &quot;balloons should extend over the period ending 30&quot;thSeptember:, 1941*The Air Ministry recently asked for an acceleration in output.     In consequence, an immediate increase in themanufacture of fabric was called for.We hope that we can secure a cumulative increase inballoon production over the coming months.Purchases and shipments of raw material on a larger scale must be made if we&quot;are to carry out the programme of20,000 balloons v/hich we now propose.In order to make the necessary dispositions, I ask thatthe Cabinet give aoprova.1 to an increase in balloon orders toa total of 20.000.&quot;(Int&apos;d)    B,
