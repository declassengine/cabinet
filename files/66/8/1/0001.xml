THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to 5ensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P. (40)171. COPY NO.  P-Q26TH MAY,  1940.WAR CABINET.BRITISH STRATEGY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.Notes by the Minister without Portfolio on Reportby Chiefs of Staff (W.P.&quot;(40)l68] The memorandum on &quot;British strategy in a certaineventuality&apos;&quot;&apos; envisages the steps which should be taken&quot;if French resistance were to collapse completely&quot;.    As,however, French resistance is considerably weakened, itseems desirable to consider now the proposals of theChiefs of Staff.This paper is confined to the economic aspects of theproblem.In the section of the memorandum dealing with our ability to defeat Germany it is said that &quot;Germany might still be defeated by economic pressure, by a continuation of air attack on economic objectives in Germany and on german morale and the creation of widespread revolt in her conquered territories&quot; (papagraph 14).In paragraph 15 it is stated that &quot;upon the economicfactor depends eur only hope of bringing about the down-fall of Germany&quot;.Whilst, as a result of her conquests, Germany may have secured new economic assets, she will.suffer certaineconomic and political disabilities in consequence.-Though she may have obtained new resources as, forexample, iron ore, her ability to utilise them effectivelyfor war purposes depends upon the possession of non-ferrous metals, which she must obtain from abroad.Moreover, for the effective prosecution of the warshe requires further supplies of food, rubber, oil, andfibres for clothing and footwear.     For these there is no adequate source of supply close at hand.Therefore, given a tight economic blockade, germany can be strangled, her war effort seriously reduced, and her industrial manpower made impotent.      In thisconnection, it is vital, as the memorandum under considera-tion points out, that we must talee- the necessary steps tosecure allies to assist us in this direction.     The

memorandum sets out two important assumptions in the plan of the Chiefs of Staff for facing a desperate situation,.    Thefirst is that &quot;the United States of America is willing togive us full economic and financial   support, without whichwe do not think we, could continue the war with&quot;any chance .&apos;fsuccess P&apos;In paragraph 17 it is asserted that &quot;given full Pan-American co-operation, we should be able to control alldeficiency commodities at source&quot;.     Paragraph 21 emphasises the view that the conclusions as to our ability to bring thewar to a successful conclusion &quot;depend   entirely upon fullPan-American economic and financial co-operation&quot;*It is vital, therefore, whether the French resistance isweakened or not, that steps should be taken to secure this connection-operation,,I suggest that immediate steps should be taken through diplomatic   channels to press for active economic assistance and that a strong mission should be sent out to America withoutdelay to secure economic and financial allies for the prosecution of the blockade with the utmost vigour.Our position will be strengthened by maintaining control as far as possible of the output of the overseas Empires of france ,&apos; Holland and Belgium.Further questions are raised in Paragraph 33 of thememorandum which reads as follows:-339     Plans have already been prepared to divert allshipping tc West Coast ports and, provided we can maintain approximately 60 per cent? of our presentimports, we believe that we should be able to obtainenough food to support the population and sufficientraw materials to continue our essential armamentproduction, although at a reduced rate0     We againdraw attention to the importance of reducing now theunimportant imports (such as bananas and children&apos;stoys;, so that the maximum import of important rawmaterials may be available to increase cur stocksof these essentials.     Moreover,  even if our imports were reduced to a mere trickle, we should still beable to tide over a critical period of a few weeksby drawing on our reserve stocks, which have beenaccumulated to meet a crisis of this nature.      Toincrease our ability to hold out in a critical period, we should now put into operation plans fordrastic rationing and distribution of stocks.Nevertheless, our ability to carry on the war is absolutely dependent upon the eventual maintenanceof supplies through the West Coast ports, and wewould point out that this will raise major problemsof labour transference.     Moreover^ the West coast ports themselves will be subjected to air attack,although possibly on a lesser scale to that on theEast and South Coasts.It should be possible to maintain approximately 60% ofour present imports, provided there is not abnormal wastageand provided also that the importation of commodities notrequired for the prosecution of the war is prohibited.      Tomake the scheme effective consideration must be given to

harbour accommodation^ to the   dispersal of raw materials andfoodstuffSj and to rail and road transport both of which wouldbe called upon1to meet substantially increased demands.Finally the situation demands the most drastic actionregarding both home production and consumption.     All kinds ofproduction which can be postponed should be damped down and every effort concentrated on two objectives:-     (l) the needs,jf the fighting and civil defence services and (2) the mainten-ance of the civil population under wartime conditions.This will necessitate the re-allocation of raw materials and the transfer of labour.It is also of great importance to restrict unnecessaryconsumption,,      This appears to be essential if the country isto be put on a war footing.These considerations require further exploration.This aspect of the question is not dealt with in thememorandum of the Chiefs of Staff, but it is an integral partof the problem which now confronts us.This memorandum is purely personal and has been drafted byme after considering memorandum W.P.(40)168, without consultationwith my colleagues or with any of the officers concerned.(intld.)
