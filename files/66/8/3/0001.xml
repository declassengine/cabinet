THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document. .SECRET.W.P.(U0) 173.;27TH MAY. 19UC COPY NO.WAR CABINET.HOME- DEFENCE.THE HOME DEFENCE EXECUTIVE.Memorandum by the Lord President of theCoomcll^oConsideration seems to be needed of the HigherDefence Organisation required to meet the risks of air attack upon, or invasion of this country.     The existing organisation includes a Home Defence Executive, whichwas set up on the joint recommendation of the Chiefs ofStaff Committee and the Ministry of Home Security, andwhich consists- of the following:-Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces.     (Chairman).Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Bomber CommandoAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Fighter CommandoAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Coastal Command.A representative of the Admiralty,A representative of the Air Ministry.The Deputy Chief of the Operations Staff,Ministry of Home Security,2,       The duties of the Home Defence Executive, andthe various matters to which their attention was particularly directed are contained in paragraphs and 9 of Annex II of W,P0(UO) 153, which was approvedby the War Cabinet at their 132nd Meeting, Minute 12.It should be noted that the Executive, while remainingindividually responsible to their own Ministries, arejointly responsible to the Chiefs of Staff Committee.The Railway Control Officer, Ministry of Transport,has since been added to the Executive.

1630       Experience has very soon shown that, if theHome Defence Executive is to take swift action onall matters, &quot;both military and civil, which enterinto the planning of the defence of this country against invasion, it must he strengthened on thecivil side,,     Its scope should be widened, and itshould no longer be responsible to the Chiefs ofStaff Committee i- though clearly on military mattersit would receive direction as before from the Chiefsof staff     The strengthening of the Executive onthe civil side should &quot;be designed to enable it togive directions for action on all matters which arethe responsibility of Civil Departments0       Theaction so decided upon would be taken by theDepartments concerned,      In addition to the operational Head of Civil Defence and therepresentative of the Ministry of Transport, I proposethat there should be appointed to the Executivea   Senior Civil Servant to represent the civil power as a whole, and to provide a link with Civil&quot;Departments outside the Ministry of Home security and the Ministry of Transport, and a seniorrepresentative of the Ministry of Home Security.Sir Findlater Stewart is the official I propose toappoint to the former posto40       The Home Defence Executive would thus be composed as follows;-Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces,    (Chairman)air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Bomber CommandoAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief,P i gh t e r C oroma nd air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Coastal Command,A representative of the AdmiraltyBA representative of the Air Ministry,,Sir Pindlater Stewart,Senior Representative of the Ministryof Home Security0Chief of the Operations Section,Ministry of Home Security0A representative of the Ministry ofTransports50       The Executive would be assisted on the Serviceside by the military staff of the General OfficerCommanding, Home Forces, and of the other Commanders-in-Chief, concerned., and on the civil side by a smallspecial Civil Service staffa6,       A direct link with the Chiefs of staff committee is already provided for Tt^ the fact that GeneralAnderson? who has been appointed Assistant Chief of the-2-

Imperial General Staff for Home Defences attendsmeetings of the Home Defence Executive and of theChiefs of Staff Committee when matters affectingHome Defence are under discussion,7. I am of the opinion that a &quot;body so composedcould deal quickly and efficiently9 and without reference to any other authorityP with mostof the problems arising during the period of planning and preparation before an attack takes place.      In the event of matters of policyarising from which a ruling must be sought from higher authority, or in the event of there being differences of opinion betweenthe Service and Civil sides of the organisation reference would bemade In the firstplace to the Secretary of State forWar and the Minister of Home Security9 who wouldgive the necessary decision in consultation with each other.     If they were unable to reach agreement9they would refer the matter for decision to theWar Cabinet^ where it would of course be decided in the presence of the Chiefs of Staff,8, If an attempted invasion were to take place9the Commanders-in-Chief would take command of operations in their own sphere - the remainingmembers of the Executive becoming their advisers on those matters with which they are concerned,9,        The above proposalss which have received the     1concurrence of the Secretary of State for War andthe Minister of Home Securitys have already beenput in hand9 and I ask for covering approval from Ithe War Cabinet, V(Intd) NoC
