NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.THE principal feature of the Naval Situation during the past week has beenthe evacuation of the B.E.F., which has imposed a heavy strain on our light craftresources and resulted in serious destroyer losses and damage. German M.T.Bs.,operating from Dutch ports, have been active.In the Narvik area naval operations have been considerably impeded byincessant enemy air activity.A reinforcement of four Canadian destroyers is on passage to the UnitedKingdom.There has been increased enemy minelaying by aircraft.Operations off the Channel Ports.2. Naval demolition parties were landed at Calais and Dunkirk, and two battalions of troops with motor transport arrived in four ships at Calais on the23rd May. On the same day the hospital ship Brighton and a trawler were sunkalongside, and another trawler was sunk in the outer channel of Dieppe by bombing. The Dutch submarines 0.23 and 0.24 safely negotiated the mined NewWaterway at Rotterdam and later arrived in England.3. On the 24th four of our destroyers which were sent to support our troopsoff Calais were heavily bombed. H.M.S. Wessejc was sunk (six ratings killed andfifteen wounded), and the Polish destroyer Burza and H.M.S. Vimiera were damaged. As the naval and military authorities considered that the destroyerscould no longer serve a useful purpose they were withdrawn.A concealed enemy battery to the westward of Calais caused considerableinterference to shipping along the coast, and the hospital ship St. Julien wasshelled during the night of the 24th. H.M.S. Verity landed ammunition and sixty Royal Marines and four Officers for duty on the quays at Calais.i. 4. French demolitions were carried out at Zeebrugge on the 24th. The seagates of the canal lock and mechanism were destroyed. Two block ships were sunk near the entrance after having been attacked by aircraft on passage. the block was completed by two additional block ships on the 26th May.The Belgian Government left Dunkirk in two motor torpedo boats and arrived at Dover on the 25th, and four French ammunition ships entered the portthat evening. At Calais the position was critical,&quot; and 300 men under CommanderGandell were landed to hold the quay.H.M.S. Galatea bombarded German batteries in the Calais area.H.M. Minesweeper Harrier was damaged by bomb on passage from Zeebruggeto Sheerness.5.   On the 26th May Dunkirk was heavily bombed.H.M.S. Galatea and later H.M.S. Aretkusa again bombarded the Calais area.During the night of 26th/27th 7,800 troops of the B.E.F. were embarked in small craft from the beaches East of Dunkirk. Bombing of this area continued on the 27th, and a further 10,300 troops were taken off under difficulties. TheS.S. Queen of the Channel was bombed and sunk returning from Dunkirk, theS.S. Isle of Thanet and Mona Isle were heavily shelled off Calais, andS.S. Sequacity was shelled and sunk.6. At 4 a.m. on the 28th May, the Belgian Army capitulated on the orderof King Leopold. All available small craft, including 27 destroyers, were sent to evacuate our troops from the beaches off Dunkirk, screened by a forceof 2 destroyers, 4 corvettes and 7 motor torpedo boats. Fighter aircraft providedfurther protection. At 6 a.m. 5 destroyers succeeded in going alongside theeast;pier at Dunkirk. By 10 p.m. on the 28th 16,500 troops had been landed in England, and 2,500 more were estimated to be on passage.H.M.S. Windsor was damaged by bombing in the Downs and sustained heavy casualties. H.M.S. Montrose was in collision during the night of the 28th witha vessel towing small boats loaded with troops, and H.M.S. Mackay ran agroundbut was later refloated. H.M.S. Wakeful was sunk by a torpedo from a motor[21338] B
torpedo boat early in the morning of the 29th. She was returning to Englandwith 630 troops on board. Casualties are not known, but many small craft picked up survivors.H.M.S. Grafton was torpedoed by an M.T.B. while assisting to pick upsurvivors from Wakeful, and later sank. There were no troops onboard. H.M. Trawler Thomas Bartlett was mined and sank off Calais.H.M. Trawler Thuringia was sunk, probably by a mine, off Nieuport. H.M.Paddle Minesweeper Brighton Belle sank after colliding with a submerged wreckin the Downs. H.M. Drifter Ocean Reward was sunk in collision withS.S. Isle of Thanet while stationed as an examination vessel off Dover. TheS.S. Abukir, with the Needham Mission on board, was torpedoed by an M.T.B.and sank 50 miles N.E. of N. Foreland. Thirty-three survivors were picked upby destroyers.7. On the 29th a number of merchant seamen at Dover refused to take their ships to sea for the evacuation and were replaced by Naval ratings from Chatham.By midnight on the 30th/31st 134,000 troops had been landed. Evacuation isstill proceeding. Up to the present 222 warships and 665 other ships have beenemployed in this operation.Twelve Naval officers and a number of ratings have been sent as a &quot; beachparty &quot; to Dunkirk, and about 130 small ships, requisitioned from the French, arebeing sent to Dover.Further naval casualties sustained during these operations include H.M.S.Grenade (destroyer), the paddle minesweepers Crested Eagle, Waverley, andminesweeping trawler Calvi sunk by bombs, the armed yacht Comfort and drifterGirl Pamela by collision. The following ships have been damaged by bombs:H.M. Destroyers Jaguar, Greyhound, Gallant, Intrepid and Saladin, ELM. SloopBideford, the paddle minesweeper Grade Fields and the minesweeping trawlerPolly Johnson.  The minesweeping trawler /ohn Cattling is missing.North Sea.8. The Dudgeon light vessel was attacked by enemy aircraft on the evening of the 23rd May, and, apart from H.M. Ships, two merchant ships were bombedin the Downs and one off the Dudgeon light vessel.On the 24th H.M. Trawlers operating from Yarmouth cut four telegraphcables between Aldeburgh and Domburg, and three more cables were cut onthe 28th between the East Coast and the Continent. ELM. Trawler CharlesBoyes was blown up off Yarmouth on the 25th, and the A/&apos;S Trawler Saon was bombed off the South Foreland.Narvik Area.9.   Narvik was captured by Allied troops on the night of the 28th/29th May.Intensive enemy bombing continued throughout the week. Bjerkvik andLilleborg piers were bombed on the night of the 22nd while troops and stores werebeing transferred. On the 24th ELM. Destroyers Fame and Firedrake and theFrench cruiser Milan* were damaged by bombs, and the supply ships Battealcoand Mashrobra and four trawlers were beached after being attacked by aircraft.On the 25th H.M. Ships Cairo and Southampton were slightly damaged, theformer had her aerials shot away, and the latter was holed by bombsplinters, the Captain, 1 officer and 27 ratings being wounded.10. H.M.S. Curlew, which was providing anti-aircraft protection inconjunction with H.M.S. Coventry, was bombed and sunk on the evening ofthe 26th. There were 25 killed. Later on the same evening the Fleet oilerOleander was seriously damaged by a near miss at Harstad and was beached.The boom defence trawler Loch Shin was bombed, and capsized after beaching.H.M.S. Glorioiis arrived from the United Kingdom and flew off her Hurricanesto Skaanland. ELM.S. Enterprise returned to the United Kingdom from Narvikwith Norwegian bullion.11. On the 27th ELM. Ships Cairo, Whirlwind and Walker were damaged by bombs. The final operation for the capture of Narvik began on the night ofthe 27th/28th May.  One battalion of French Foreign Legion and one Norwegian
battalion landed on the southern shore of the Rombak Fjord covered by the guns of H.M. Ships, which were heavily bombed. There were 40 British Navalcasualties.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.12. During the week one Greek ship was torpedoed and sunk, 1 Frenchship reported sunk and 2 British ships attacked by U-Boats, one of which theS.S. Telena, was gunned and set on fire. 1 British ship and 1 Panamanian tankerwere mined, the former (probably in ballast) in the Bristol Channel and the latterin the harbour at Havre.The list of losses due to enemy aircraft shown in the Appendix I is givenwith reserve this week owing to the confused situation prevailing at the channel ports, where additional losses may have occurred, but in regard to which information has not yet been received.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. A total of 670 ships, of which 88 were Allied and 36 neutral, were convoyed during the week and there were no losses. Since the commencement ofhostilities 22,181 ships, including 1,452 Allied and 3,121 neutral, have beenconvoyed, out of which 31 have been sunk. 1 Cruiser, 9 Armed merchant cruisers, 11 Destroyers and 12 Sloops were employed on escort duty. imports into Great Britain amounted to 1,070,795 tons. 31 tankers brought 342,908 tonsof oil, of which 4, with 42,000 tons, went to France. Minerals amounted to190,820 tons and cereals and flour 171,802 tons. There were 4 large consignments of frozen meat amounting to 16,452 tons and 59,540 tons of sugar.Anti-Submarine Operations.14. H.M.S. Scimitar carried out an attack on a presumed U-Boat target offCherbourg on the 24th May, and on the same evening H.M.S. Vansittart droppeddepth charges on a contact 20 miles South-East of Wick.15. On the morning of the 25th H.M.S. Jackal sighted a U-Boat in the act of submerging in a position 20 miles south-east of Lowestoft. A pattern of depth charges was fired with promising results. One of our aircraft attacked a U-Boat80 miles south-west of Lands End on the 29th. rGerman Intelligence.16. There is little or no information available as to the German MainUnits except that the cruiser Emden is reported to be undergoing repairs at Oslo.German M.T.B.&apos;s which have been frequently in evidence off the Dutch and belgian coasts in the current week, and. have even been observed as far south as Cap Grisnez, are believed to be based on Helder (North Holland) and possibly on Ymuiden.There are believed to be two or three U-Boats in the Western Approaches andone or two off the coast of Portugal. It is possible that some are operating in theSouthern North Sea. It is believed that the Germans now have about 60 U-boats in commission.Enemy Minelaying and British Mines weeping.17. On the night of the 25th-26th May there was intense enemy aircraftminelaying activity in both the Dover and Portsmouth areas. Both ports were closed. Dover was re-opened on the 26th May having been closed for less thana day. Portsmouth was re-opened on the 27th May.During the week, more mines have been dropped in or near the harbours of dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne, and Dieppe. The last mentioned port has now been closed since the 18th May. In the Calais approaches LL trawlers exploded fourmines on the 22nd May.[21338] B 2
It was estimated that altogether 40 mines had been dropped off Le Havre,in the Seine approaches and in the river. Of these, apart from two casualties,British minesweepers have exploded 8 mines and&apos;the French 6. Le Havre was-opened to all ships on the 26th May and by the next day the river was freeup&apos;to Rouen.During the week LL Sweep has exploded 3 mines to the east of the entrance to The Tyne. It is considered possible that a submarine laid them recently.The Tyne has not been closed.M. Sweep exploded a mine on the 28th May south of the approach channelto Invergordon. This mine was probably laid by submarine and not by aircraft,and there may be more mines in the vicinity. The ports of Invergordon andInverness were closed by local action pending further investigation.The total number of magnetic mines dealt with is now 208, contact minesnumbering 385.18. A surface mine which resembled a dan float was exploded by gunfireabout 5 miles North of Cherbourg. Ships are being warned that these apparentfloats are highly dangerous.Fast minesweepers and trawlers have been concentrated on the South-east coast ports as it is highly important that searched channels should be maintained in this area.A new searched channel has been established East of the Tay to route heavyships outside the 20-fathom line.A new channel has been established in the Swansea approach from the west and the dangerous areas are either cancelled or reduced in size.The M.D. (Mine-destructor) vessel H.M.S. Corfield has been ready sincethe 24th May. &apos;Four magnetic sweeps are being sent to Alexandria.Danish fishing boats have stated that the British declared minefield tothe west of Denmark is perfectly safe to fish in as all the mines have beenswept.British Minelaying.19. Extensive minelaying has been carried out in the East Coast Barrierthis week. The French submarine Rubis laid mines off the Norwegian coaston the 27th May, and in the early part of the week our aircraft dropped mines in the German North Sea Estuaries.German Merchant Shipping.20. The Rosario (6,079 tons) is reported to have been sunk by the Norwegianson the 10th April.The Alster (3,510 tons), which was captured on the 11th April, is on herway from Norway to Scapa with a cargo of iron-ore.It is reported that the Weissenfels (7,860 tons), which is at Bandar Shahpurat the head of the Persian Gulf, started erecting something in her bows after receiving thirty-five heavy packages from an Italian ship. She had been usingher wireless, but that has now been re-sealed by the Persian authorities.German ships at Kobe are said to be unable to leave without the permission of the Japanese Government. Japanese interests appear to be anxious to charterthese ships.The German Augsburg (6,512 tons), which is at Dairen, was transferred tothe Netherlands flag in agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government in January.A message from N.D.L. Bremen to N.D.L. Dairen&quot; which was intercepted onthe 20th May, gave instructions for the ship to be handed over to a Dutch captainwho would be arriving at the end of May.The Rhakotis (6,753 tons), which left Callao in Peru on the 16th May, arrivedat Antofagasta in Chile on the 23rd May.Earthquakes at Callao have caused extensive damage to shipping there.Four German ships were in the harbour, the Hermonthis (4,833 tons), the Leipzig(5,898 tons), the munchen (5,619 tons) and the Montserrate (5,578 tons).The Konigsberg (6,466 tons) sailed from Para on the 25th May, ostensiblyfor Pernambuco. A Condor flying boat, which had been held up at Para awaiting the arrival of a spare part, received itiust before the Konigsberg got underway.
Economic Warfare.21. During the week ending the 25th May, 2,022 tons of goods destined for Germany were seized in prize. The largest item was 1,598 tons of petroleumtaken from an Estonian ship. The total seizures up to the 25th May was636,314 tons.German Contraband Control.22. According to a Swedish report several Swedish and Finnish ships inStavanger, Bergen and other Norwegian harbours have been taken over by theGerman authorities. The Swedish Gallia (1,419 tons), the Finnish Anton H.(1,436 tons), the Estonian Mare (1,217 tons) and the Swedish Rosenholm (1,736tons), which were anchored at Bergen early in April, are all reported to havebeen captured by the Germans and the Finnish Usko (1,876 tons) has been seizedand taken to Hamburg.Comparisons of Norwegian, Danish, Dutch and Belgian Tonnage Gained by theEnemy and the Allies.23. In paragraph 19 of last week&apos;s resume it was stated that the Allies had acquired the use of approximately 3,700,000 tons of Danish and Norwegianshipping consequent on the German invasion of these countries. This figure, infact, represented tonnage which might, in certain circumstances, be regarded aspotentially available (subject to the legitimate requirements of American andother neutral charterers) for the services of the United Kingdom and France, butit is emphasised that a large proportion of the tonnage in question had been in allied service before the invasions of Scandinavia and the Low Countries, and it,therefore, cannot be assumed that any gain in importing capacity will result.Italy.24. In the naval sphere, the principal events of the last week have been the taking up of a certain number of merchant vessels and the arming of certain ofsuch small craft by the Government. The Italian Fleet may be considered to beat its war stations. The 1st Squadron is at Taranto, the 2nd Squadron at Naplesand Augusta, and the two 6-inch cruisers and a number of destroyers of theSchool of Command in Sicilian waters. So far as is known, no additions havebeen made to the naval strength in colonial waters. Various items of informa-tion, including the fitting out of three hospital ships, suggest that an overseascampaign may be in contemplation.Merchant Shipping.25. In general Italian merchant shipping has remained normal in the period under review, and on the 29th May there were 14 Italian ships in ports of theUnited Kingdom, and 5 more due to arrive. There have been, however,progressively circumstantial accounts of cancellations, hastenings and postpone-ments of sailings, the total effect of which may be intended to leave the issueobscure. These accounts refer mostly to the larger and more spectacular italian ships and services.Italian tanker movements are of interest,in the present situation. There are5 ships of 28,063 tons total in transit between Gibraltar and the Gulf ports, andthere are 4 ships of 21,523 tons total in transit between Gibraltar and the DutchWest Indies. These are all outward bound. Of the homeward bound ships thereare 3 ships of 18,600 tons in transit between the Gulf ports and Gibraltar, and5 ships of 28,904 tons between the Dutch West.Indies and Gibraltar. There are,however, 4 ships of 22,894 tons in the Dutch West Indies, and various other ships at ports outside Italy, making a total of 23 Italian tankers of 131,979 tons. this analysis was made on the 27th May.MILITARY SITUATION.western Front.26. During the period under review the main German thrust, which at first was approaching: the sea, changed direction and two armoured divisions swungnorthwards to attack Boulogne and Calais, both of which were eventually
occupied by the enemy. A larger force headed by three armoured divisions strucknorth-eastwards, their blow falling upon the line St. Omer -Bethune. Both these forces were supported by motorised divisions, which were relieved on the southern front by infantry divisions.27. The Allied Forces in north-east France and Belgium being thus hemmedin, the conventional German search for a tactical soft spot ensued. Attacks at st.. Omer and further south at Carvin having failed to achieve penetration, the pressure was shifted on the 25th May to the eastern face of the Allied salient,where heavy attacks between Menin and Courtrai resulted in breaching theBelgian right flank. Two days later a further attack to the north near Eeclooproduced a break on a 10-kilometre front. The determined exploitation of thisgap, combined with heavy attacks all along the front north of Courtrai to thesea and assisted by intensive air bombing of forward troops, battery positions and communications, led to the capitulation of the Belgian Army on the morning of the 29th May. The left flank of the B.E.F. and 1st French Army was thusimperilled.28. The approximate German line at the end of the period was : Grave-lines- Wormhout-Bailleul-Lille-Ypres-Dixmude-Nieuport; the heaviest fightingtaking place on the eastern face of this salient, where large German forces,previously faced by the Belgians, were released for attack.29. The whole of ten German armoured divisions were used in the aboveoperations. Apart from air action in support of ground attack, there has been extremely heavy air bombing of towns, particularly at the ports.30. On its Southern front the German Army held a strong defensive left flank from Montmedy to the sea west of Abbeville running mainly along theRivers Aisne and Somme.  Divisions are, however, holding very wide fronts.31. A day-to-day Diary of Events on the Western Front is attached asan Appendix &quot; V.&quot;Scandinavia.32. On the 28th May, following a successful opposed landing, an allied force composed of two battalions French Foreign Legion and one Norwegianbattalion captured Narvik town. The landing was supported by the guns ofH.M. Ships and French artillery and was covered by R.A.F. fighters. strong opposition was encountered from enemy aircraft and the Germans launched a determined but unsuccessful counter-attack from the East.Narvik peninsula from the town to about 3 miles Eastwards is now entirely in our hands. Some 100 Germans were killed during the attack and 200 prisonerstaken, our casualties have been estimated as slight. Exploitation towards theSwedish frontier is now being carried out.33. In the Bodo area the 24th Guards Brigade have withdrawn a further60 miles and, together with five Independent Companies, are now occupying Bodoand a line of fiords running Eastwards for about 30 miles.Mediterranean.34. Evacuation of non-combatants from Mediterranean garrisons is proceeding. One thousand women and children have been evacuated from malta and all service families from Gibraltar. A number of the civil population of gibraltar are also being moved to French Morocco.Non-combatants from Aden are being taken to India.Italy and Italian Possessions.35. Military preparations have continued steadily during the past week andhave included the reinforcement of the French Frontier. Units of the existingAlbanian garrison have been moved towards the Yugoslav frontier. Both the yugoslav and Greek General Staffs appear to be unperturbed.
36. There has also been a methodical increase in the garrison of Libya. no new units or formations have been identified, although the native troops inCirenaica now appear to have been formed into a Libyan Division. The intentionto create two native divisions was officially notified by the Italians in January1939.The Balkan States and Turkey.37. It seems probable that, in the event of war in the near future, Turkeywill be able to place in the field 40 infantry divisions, 3 cavalry divisions and1 armoured brigade, but some of these divisions will be without their full quota of artillery.38. In Yugoslavia all males between the ages of 16 and 70, apart from those required for the armed forces, are to be placed at the disposal of the government when a state of alertness has been proclaimed. There is no truth in the reportthat considerable Yugoslav forces are concentrating near the Bulgarian frontier.39. In Roumania the 1st, 3rd and 4th armies are being mobilised, and uponcompletion it is estimated that there will be 900,000 men under arms. Germany&apos;sfifth column activities appear to be planned on the same lines as in othercountries. Apart from the organisation of the German minority of 800,000 andthe very large number of &quot; tourists &quot; and &quot; business men,&quot; German ships on the danube are now reported to be manned by double crews.Far East.40. Though there are signs that reactionary elements in Japan are puttingpressure on the Government for more positive action regarding the Dutch east indies, the Government is still holding to its policy of obtaining, by negotiation,such concessions as are considered essential to safeguard Japan&apos;s trading positionand supply of raw materials.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Air Defence of Great Britain.41. Enemy air operations over our coasts are described in paragraph 56.No interceptions were made by Fighter Command over this country.Western Front.42. Three Lysander and two Blenheim squadrons of the Royal Air ForceComponent are now based in England, while six Battle Squadrons and threeHurricane Squadrons of the Advanced Air Striking Force are established at new aerodromes south of the Somme front. Both Commands have continued totake an active part in operations in support of the Allied armies in northern france. Seventy-nine tactical and fifty-seven strategical reconnaissances havebeen flown by aircraft of the Component, and in addition numerous specialmissions have been undertaken. Bombs have been dropped on gun positions nearCalais and on tanks near Gravelines.43. On the 27th May 38 Lysanders were used to drop supplies of food andammunition for the defenders of Calais. Five Lysanders, five Blenheims and oneHector have failed to return from sorties. The Battles of the Striking Forcehave been used continuously, in particular for night bombing, and have notincurred heavy losses. In addition to their employment in Northern France, theyhave been used against the enemy&apos;s communications and supplies on the UpperMeuse, and against objectives in the Saarland. On the 26th May, following information received, eight Battles were sent under fighter protection to attacka chateau at which a meeting of high officers of the German Air Force was taking place, and bombed the area heavily.
44. The fighter squadrons have not been so heavily engaged as in the North,and have been hampered by very bad weather, but 14 German aircraft have been shot down and five other victories are probable. Four of our fighters are missing;four others previously reported missing have now returned to their aerodromes.On the 23rd May one Hurricane, which was separated from a formation,endeavoured to attack six Me. 109&apos;s, but they refused combat. On the 27th Maya Hurricane squadron attacked a formation of 24 tie. lll&apos;s escorted by20 Me. 110&apos;s. The German escort made off, and was pursued by twoHurricanes, who shot down one Me. 110, while the rest of the squadron destroyednine of the bombers.45. The main effort of Bomber Command during the week has beenexpended in France and Belgium. Day bombing sorties have been flown bybetween 25 and 50 Blenheims daily, and objectives of all kinds near the head ofthe enemy&apos;s advance have been heavily attacked. Great damage has been seenamong columns of tanks and motor transport, and roads and bridges have been damaged; attacks have also been made on advanced enemy headquarters. Ourown losses have been comparatively slight, probably on account of the protection against enemy fighters afforded by our fighter patrols. Night bombing has alsocontinued on a very heavy scale. This has in part been directed at objectives inthe enemy forward areas, in part against his communications farther back, in belgium and in the area of the Meuse. On the night of the 23rd/24th,24 Whitleys were engaged in the Avesnes-Maubeuge area, and 48 Wellingtonsattacked Gembloux, Charleroi and the Meuse crossings. On the following night29 Whitleys and 12 Wellingtons were engaged. Operations have been continued on a similar scale throughout the week, with very slight losses.46. Aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm have also been used in close co-operationwith those of the Royal Air Force against targets near the French coast. Enemytanks were attacked near Gravelines on the 25th May, and two four-inch guns were put out of action; similar operations were carried out near Calais on the27th and 29th May. On the 26th May, three Swordfish did artillery co-operationwork for naval units bombarding objectives near Calais.47. Fighter protection in Northern France and covering the withdrawalof the B.E.F. has been afforded largely by squadrons based on this country.This heavy additional commitment has seriously extended Fighter Command,who have flown 320 patrols, involving over two thousand sorties during the week.The majority of this effort has been directed, from aerodromes in Kent, in main-taining regular standing patrols over the Boulogne-Calais-Dunkirk and Lille-Arras areas. Squadrons are employed in rotation and latterly large compositeformations have been used. The main enemy air effort has been in support ofhis land operations in this area, and very heavy and continuous air fighting-has resulted. Our fighters have proved exceedingly successful, and, on the after-noon of the 29th May, a squadron of Defiant turret fighters destroyed 40 enemy aircraft in two patrols, without any casualties to themselves, 16 Me. 109&apos;sbeing shot down in a single attack. The results of the week&apos;s fighting by home-based fighters is summarised as follows :  Enemy Losses. Our Aircraft.Confirmed.   Unconfirmed.   Missing.May 2323 26 830 9 1217 5 522 750 29 1421 5 1661 19 11Total for week .22711573i Some of the British aircraft missing may have forced-landed away fromtheir bases.
Attacks on Germany.48. Although the primary objective during the week has been support of.E.F. operations in Northern France, operations have continued againstcommunications, oil installations and industrial objectives in Germany.Night bombing of Germany was carried out nightly up to the 27th/28th May.On the 23rd/24th May forty-six Hampdens attacked railway communications in the Rhineland, particularly in the Emmerich, Koblenz and Koln areas. Onthe following night twelve Hampdens again bombed railways and marshalling yards, largely in the area West of the Rhine (Luxembourg, Roermond,Maastricht), while eighteen Whitleys attacked the Ruhr. On the 25th/26th Maytwenty-eight Hampdens attacked Rhineland communications, eighteen Whitleysattacked blast furnaces at Dusseldorf and Krefeld and oil refineries at Emmerichand Reisholz. Twenty-one heavy bombers were employed on the 26th/27th May,and seventy-three on the 27th/28th May; the objectives on the latter occasionincluded oil refineries at Hamburg and Bremen. Raids have also been made bythe Advanced Air Striking Force on industrial objectives in the Saarland. to judge from the reports of air crews and from information which is beginning to come in as to the results of earlier raids, the cumulative effect of these attacksmust have been very great; the losses incurred have been low. There are indications that the Germans are beginning to abandon the policy of active anti-aircraft and searchlight defence in favour of a more passive policy, intended toprevent accurate bombing by the combined use of smoke-screens and searchlights.49. Oil tanks at Rotterdam were attacked by eight Hudsons on the night of the 24th/25th May, and by six Hudsons on the following night. It is believedthat the stocks have now been almost completely destroyed.Norway.50. The intensity of the battle in the West has somewhat limited activityover Norway, but reconnaissance of the fjords has been regularly maintained and shipping movements reported. On the 29th May a Hudson on reconnaissancedropped a stick of bombs across Bergen harbour; after the bombing, one merchant ship alongside the wharves was seen to be burning furiously. There were about20 Messerschmitt 109&apos;s on Stavanger aerodrome on the 27th May; one was seen in the air and took avoiding action when attacked by one of our Blenheims,which then machine-gunned aircraft on the ground and in the seaplane anchorage.Three oil tanks* near Stavanger were bombed without observed result. OneBlenheim failed to return from this sortie. A new aerodrome appears to be under construction at Voss on the Oslo-Bergen railway.51. On the 27th May Bodo was heavily bombed by twelve enemy aircraft which also attacked the aerodrome with machine-guns. Four enemy were destroyed by two Gladiators. Gladiators also carried out low-flying attacks in support of the attack on Narvik.52. One Gladiator and one Hurricane Squadron are now based on aerodromes in the Narvik area. Some aircraft have been damaged on the groundby enemy bombing, but losses have not been very severe and action against enemy bombers has been successful. Statistics are not yet complete, but up to the28th May eighteen confirmed and six unconfirmed enemy losses have been reported;these include three Ju. 90 four-engined bombers shot down by Gladiators.North Sea.53. Coastal Command patrols have been increasingly concentrated in thesouthern part of the North Sea, and aircraft of the Command and of the fleet air Arm have taken part in operations against German land forces on theFrench and Belgian coasts. Aircraft patrols have been useful in assisting therescue of soldiers and refugees from small vessels off the coast. Practically theonly enemy naval activity has been that of motor torpedo boats, which have been&amp;ade the subject of persistent air attack. Two M.T.Bs. were attacked offCalais on the night of the 23rd/24th May by a Fleet Air Arm Swordfish, whichmachine-gunned one of them after bombing without effect; a formation of fivekwordfish was then sent out, but failed to make contact. On the following[21338] ... c
night an Anson destroyed one M.T.B. by a direct hit in the same area. two others were attacked by two Ansons on the 25th May. and damage may have beendone by near misses; one Anson forced-landed on the sea, and the crew was picked up. There were 24 other sightings of M.T.Bs. between the 27th and 30th May,and two attacks were made. Four destroyers were attacked off Terschellingon the 28th May and four attacks were made during the week on enemy trawlers.Merchant ships were bombed on three occasions, off Zeebrugge, off Ymuiden,and in the Ems estuary; salvage operations were seen to be in progress in the latterarea on three wrecks, one of which appeared to be a warship. Mines were laidby six Beauforts on the night of the 24th/25th May, and an attack was madeon a seaplane base at Texel by Fleet Air Arm aircraft on the 29th May.German Air Operations.54. The German Air Force has continued to concentrate almost entirely onsupport of the thrust toward the Channel Forts, except for such parts of it a shave been engaged in Norway. The whole long-range bomber force has beenemployed, although it is probable that on each day three or four units have beenstood down for a brief rest. All dive-bomber units, with the exception of thatin Norway, have now been identified in action on the Western Front. transport aircraft continue to be used for evacuating wounded and ior supplying units inthe occupied areas, and the minelaying unit has operated off the Dutch, belgian and French coasts almost nightly during the past week.55. German casualties from the 10th-29th May are estimated at,180 aircraft; this includes about 400 troop-carrying aircraft. There is as yet no adequate evidence by which to judge the effects of recent events on Germanmorale, and the evidence in regard to reserves of trained crews is somewhatconflicting. There have been obvious variations in the standards of training ofthe formations encountered, and some of the pilots captured have not been fullytrained; this may, however, indicate only that a proportion of the trained personnel is being held in reserve.56. On the night of the 24th-25th May, a few German aircraft crossed theEnglish coast with our own returning bombers, and were not identified as hostileuntil bombs had been dropped. Their objectives appear to have been aerodromes in Yorkshire and in East Anglia and factories on Tees-side. About 50 bombs have been reported, but practically no damage was done, and factory production was not interrupted. Bomber-reconnaissance aircraft were active later in theweek off Scotland, and as far down Channel as Portsmouth, especially on the night 30th-31st May, when it was also reported that shipping had been bombedin the Downs and a convoy attacked off Orfordness. There are some indications that these reconnaissances might be directed to preparing the way for an attackon South Coast ports and aerodromes. Early on the 29th May a Dornier 17attacked one of our civil aircraft without success near Shoreham.57. In Norway, the preparation of a new landing-ground at Voss and of fivelanding-grounds in the Trondhjem area is reported.Italy.58. The proposal has been made in the Italian Chamber, and will presumablybe accepted, that anti-aircraft defence should be placed under the direct controlof the air force. Various operational reasons were adduced in favour of thisproposal. At present, anti-aircraft defence is controlled by two separateorganisations, the specialised units of the Army, and the &quot; Voluntary Militia for national Security.&quot; All anti-aircraft personnel, including reserves, were called up on the 14th May to engage in exercises, which were to commence on the23rd May.59. A formation of nine bombers was flown to Pantelleria on the 21st May;it is possible that this squadron may be stationed on the new aerodrome there.60. It appears that the Breda 65 fighters with which the 50th Stormo in libya were equipped have proved most unsatisfactory; they are now being returned to Italy, and the Stormo will be re-equipped as a bomber unit
61. All leave has been stopped in Italian East Africa and the transport ofthe families of serving personnel to Abyssinia has been forbidden. Mobilisationis said to have been completed on the 27th May. Every effort is being made toincrease the existing stocks of fuel, and ammunition.Spain.62. The number of aircraft now in the Balearics is estimated to be 37-41bombers, 52-68 fighters and 8-11 seaplanes, &amp;c. There is no evidence that thereare any aircraft either on Minorca or Ibiza, although a report states that an aerodrome is being prepared on the latter, and that aircraft are expected. Itis stated that General Kindelan, Governor of the Balearics and late Chief of theAir Staff, has been appointed General Officer Commanding, Land and Air Forcesin the Balearics.The Balkan States.63. Bulgaria. Work has begun on the project of a Government aircraft factory and, although delays are being caused by lack of material, it is hopedthat the factory may be completed by the autumn and be in production by june, 1941.  The layout was designed by five Polish architects and engineers.The German firm of Baumann and Company, of Sofia, has been given the contract for building underground petrol reservoirs at various Bulgarianaerodromes. There are indications that the construction of two undergroundstorage tanks at Varna, one for petrol and the other for heavy oil, will be takenin hand soon.64. Roumania.Si-  officers and eighteen N.C.Os. of the German Air Forcearrived in Bucharest on the 3rd May.65. Yugoslavia. Few details are available about the present dispositions of the Yugoslav Air Force, but it appears that it has been widely dispersed andthat no large concentration of aircraft now remains at any one aerodrome.Tentative negotiations appear to be in progress for the purchase of aircraft andbombs in Japan.[21338]

B.E.F. Diary of Events.May 24.Boulogne was evacuated. All troops except about 200 from mixed units wereevacuated.Brigadier Nicholson with 30th Infantry Brigade was invested in Calais.May 25.B.E.F. facing East in the old frontier defences from Bourghelles to Ffalluinwas not seriously attacked.The improvised forces (Mac Force, Peter Force, Lumsden&apos;s Force) were abolished and the army re-organised as follows : Eastern Sector.I Corps : 1 and 42 Divs.II Corps : 3 and 4 Divs.South- Western Sector.Ill Corps : 5 and 50 Divs.Rusty Force (Maj.-Gen. Eastwood).2 Div.   .46 Div. (labour div.).44 Div.23 Div. (labour div.).One Inf. Bde. 48 div.G.H.Q. Reserve.48 Div. (less one Inf. Bde.).May 26.The threat to the Belgian right flank forced the B.E.F. to employ one division on the line Comines-Ypres.One Armoured division was employed on mopping up operations with theFrench between the R. Somme and R. Bresle.The defence of Calais continued in the face of increasing enemy pressure.Our forces were hemmed into the Citadel and outer fort where they were heavilybombarded. Naval gunfire and air attacks gave temporary support. Resistanceceased about 1900 hours.May 27.The B.E.F. held the line Annapes-Marcq-Warneton, with rear guards on thefrontier Bourghelles-Halluin.A gap developed on our left, caused by the withdrawal of the Belgians tothe North. To close this all available resources, including 5 and 50 divs., were despatched to the line Comines-Ypres.May 28.There was little change in the situation. The Western front followedapproximately the line Gravelines-St. Pierre Brouck-Cassel-Hasebrouck-LaGorgue-La Bassee.South of the Somme 1 Armoured Division was withdrawn into reserve, bothBrigades having suffered some casualties.May 29.The Belgian capitulation on the previous day led to some re-organisation ofthe position. As a result the B.E.F. was drawn up on the line Proven-Poperinghe-
Ypres-Bixchoote, with I Corps on the right, II Corps on the left. Adam force was formed to organise a bridgehead round Dunkirk, excluding Bergues-Fousnes-Nieuport.Evacuation from the pier and beaches at Dunkirk began during the night27th-28th and proceeded continuously day and night. Enemy bombingcaused some interference and confusion on the beaches, but strong fighterprotection by the R.A.F. enabled the work to continue without interruption.May 30.Up to the morning of the 31st May the following troops had been evacuated from the Dunkirk area : B.E.F.-Fit ..................      124,648Casualties ............... 9,230133,878Allies (mostly French) ............        11,666Total145,544
