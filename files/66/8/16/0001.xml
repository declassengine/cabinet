THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this documei7 vJ4C) 186.jjlgcToX ( 40J)  415).9*COPY NO.. AWAR CABINETBOMBARDMENT POLICY.Report by the Chiefs.,of Stiff Committee.Just before the war instructions were issued byHis Majesty&apos;s Government to principal Commanders, to govern the conduct of all forms of bombardment.     A copyof these instructions is attached as Annex I.      the underlying motive at the time of the issue of these instructions was that,  on all grounds, we should seize any possible chance of avoiding unrestricted air warfare inthe coming conflictB      It was considered almost certainthat German air action would cause us to withdraw, ordrastically amend these instructions during the first fewdays of war,2. The opening up of the war in the West lias of necessity forced us to adopt a much wider interpretation of the term &quot;military objective&quot; than that contained inthe existing instructions which are now binding on ourCommanders in other possible theatres of war.      Therewould appear to be no advantage to be gained by restricting the action of our Commanders more severely in one theatrethan in another,      Moreover, under the existing rules, ourCommanders abroad may be severely handicapped, due to thepresent restriction on the methods which they are allowedto employ,,3. We, therefore, propose that the existinginstructions governing bombardment (Annex I) should be cancelled and that revised instructions (Annex if) shouldbe issued forthwith.     We    seek  the approval of the WarCabinet to these revised instructions.(Signed)    R.E.C.PEIRSE.V.C.A.S.R0H.  HAINING.V.O.I.O.S.C.S. DANIEL.(for C.N.S.)Cabinet War Room.

ANNE2LLINSTRUCTIONS BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT TO govern the COICDUCT DP Xli JVISJZ. OF BOIiBAlUJilENT.      ISSUEDIMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO Tliii GiOlI EllCIIiXNT OF THE VaR.1, The following instructions will govern theconduct of all forms of boinb.ardment---until the restrictionstherein-contained are modified.These&quot;restrictions, in the meantime, are notto he relaxed on any account pending further instructions,even in retaliation for indiscriminate action &quot;by an enemy.2, The object of the instructions is not to definelegitimate military objectives, hut to lay down a course ofaction in accordance with the agreed policy, which it maybe expedient to adopt at the outset of war.      It will he observed that the effect will he to restrict bombardment moreseverely tnan is required by a reasonahle interpretation ofexisting international law.3. Only the following &quot;purely military objectives inthe narrowest sense of the word&quot; may he bombarded from thesea or air.     Army Commanders will conform generally to thespirit of these instructions:-(a) Naval forces, i.e. warships, auxiliariesactually attendant on the Fleet, naval dock-..... yards, barracks and other establishmentsmanned by naval personnel.(b) Army units, fortifications, coast defence works,&quot;&apos;barracks, camps, billets, depots, dumps, andother e^t-ablJLshments manned by military, personnel.(c) Air units, military aerodromes, depots, storageunits, JhoBife-stores and other establishmentsmanned by air personnel.(d) Troop transports (whether at sea or in harbour),roads, canals, and railways used for militarycommunications, military road and inland water transport.Trains, road and inland water transport are notto be attacked unless they can reasonably be presumed to be of a military character.(e) Accumulations of Navy, Army or Air Force stores.(This does not authorise attack on factories).(f) Naval, Army and Air Force fuel installations ordumps in the field or situated within theconfines of the Naval, Army and Air Forceestablishments mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a)to (c) above..(Note:     Bulk stocks of fuel, not covered bythe above definition, are not to bebombarded under these instructions).

l Ac.ti.on against objectives in paragraph 3 above-wiU-^e--suti.j^c-t to the following general principles:-(a) The intentional bombardment of civilpopulations is illegal,(b) It must be possible to distinguish andidentify the objectives in question. &apos;(c) Bombardment must be carried out in sucha way that there is reasonable expectation that damage will be confined to the objective and that civilian populations in theneighbourhood are not bombarded throughnegligence.Thus it is clearly illegal to bombard apopulated area in the hope of hitting a legitimate target which is known to be inthe area, but which cannot be precisely-located and identified.5. Subject to the general policy set out above,Commanders must exercise their discretion, and orders forbombardment should be framed according to the spirit of that policy and not necessarily to the letter.      In particular it must be borne in mind that the fact of an objective&quot;being unquestionably military does not necessarily orinvariably justify bombardment of it.      Thus an anti-aircraft or coast defence gun situated in the centre of a populousarea could not be bombarded with reasonable expectation that damage would be confined to it.     A small detachment oftroops in billets In, or a convoy ofthrough a town, or a troop transportcommercial wharf, are unquestionablytransport passinglying alongside amilitary objectives,out the bombardment of such objectives in a town might involve risks to the civil population out of all proportion to the militarjr importance of the target at the time andmight thus be unjustifiable.      Justification for bombardmenteven of unquestionably military objectives must thereforedepend upon circumstances and must be decided by Commanders,acting in the spirit of these instructions.6. The necessary action is being taken to securethe adherence of our prospective allies to this policy, andthe necessary coiumuni cat ions are being made to the Governmentsof the Dominions and of India.7. Later, it may be desirable, to extend the scopeof these instructions to the full extent allowed for by thefollowing: --Naval BombardmentAir Force ^o^^rdmentHague Convention No. IXof 1907.The Draft Hague Rules of aerial Warfare 1922/23 asinterpreted in Air Ministryinstructions to be issued inthe near future.Until such times as further instructions are issued from London, however, the above will stand,     They are,however, liable to be modified at the shortest notice.8.action of armies is well established bypractice and is not in dispute.      Commanders of military forces on the ground will use every reasonable precaution to avoidundue loss of civilian life by artillery bombardment.

1, The following instructions are to be substituted for those previously governing bombardment policy.      The latter are-&apos;hereby cancelled.g. The action of armies is well established by practice.Commanders of land forces will use every reasonable preaaut *rito avoid undue loss of civilian life by artillery bombardment.3. Bombardment by naval and air forces is to be confined to military objectives and must be subject to the following general   principles: - -(a) The intentional bombardment of civil populationsas such is illegal,(b) It must be possible to identify the objective.(c) The attack must be made   with reasonable care toavoid undue loss of civil life in the vicinity&apos; of the target.(d) The provisions of Red Cross conventions are tobe observed.4. The following military objectives may be attacked:-/&quot;in the following categories the term &quot;military&quot; is usedin its widest sense to include all armed forces.      These donot include merchant ships whether defensively armed or not^J^(a) Military forces including naval auxiliaries of whatever description and whether or not atten-dant on the fleet;    troop transports and militarysupply ships whethpr at sea or in port.(NOTE.    Areas in which all shipping can be treatedas enemy transports or military supply ships will be specially notified,)(b) Military-works and fortifications,(c) Military establishments and depots including barracks,camps.., billets and naval dockyards.;    aerodromes.,whether designated military or civil;    stores and dumps of military supplies,,(d) Shipyards,  factories and other establishments.engaged in the manufacture;, assembly or repair of lBllitsujy material, -^rojcipment or- suppliasv^l u ;-power soha-^-ffins ancillary thereto;    fuel&apos; and oil producing plants,  refineries and storageinstallations.(e) Lines of communication and transportation and meansof interconmiunication, serving military purposes.Provided that the principles set out In paragraph   above are observed,   other objectives,, the des*-truction of which is an immediate military necessitymay he-Ai&amp;aiL-__-.urtiou.lar reasons95* In the case, of naval bombardment of objectives in a town, warning should be given if the safety of the attackinglorce or the success of the operations is not jeopardised by so doing. -3- annex,.
