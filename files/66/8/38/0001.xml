At the 163rd Meeting on the same day the War Cabinet took note of the fact that the Secretary ofState for War wished to reconsider the matter in thelight of the new situation.2. On reconsideration the Chiefs of Staff at their178th Meeting on the 13th June decided to recommend to theWar Cabinet that the two battalions should not be sent,and that owing to the imminence of the occupation of theFrench coast it would be better to demilitarise the Islands,and to prepare for the destruction of facilities whichmight be of value to the enemy.     Before this recommendationoould be put to the War Cabinet it became apparent that itwas necessary to use Aerodromes in the -Channel Islands forthe protection of the evacuation of the B.E.F. from Brestand Cherbourg...    Thereupon orders were given to re-distributethe troops in the Channel Islands, and to. reinforce thedefence forces with one battery of light A.A. guns,COPY no

3. The Chiefs of Staff now consider that the policy as to the defence of the Islands when it is no longer required to use the aerodromes should he decided upon.Their recommer.dat ions are:-(i) That all regular British troops should hewithdrawn from the Islands,(ii) That the local forces which remain should be given the role of internal security(including anti-sabotage) only,(iii) That preparation for destruction of thefacilities which might be of value tothe enemy, and which he could not equallywell obtain on the mainland, (e.g, oil stocks) should be made to be carried outin case of invasion,,(iv) That as the Islands will have beendemilitarised it will be unnecessary and undesirable tc evacuate women and children,and that the Minister of Home Security-should be so informed.(v) That orders should be issued to the lieutenant-Governors not to defend^the islands in the event of enemy invasionby sea or air,4.        I We consider that effect   should be given to theserecomraendat ions immediately the aerodromes are no longer required,     This situation may occur almost immediately.(Signed)    C.L.N. 1T3WALL.&quot; J.
