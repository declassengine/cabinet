INTRODUCTORY,In a separate paper submitted, to-day (paper. P. ( G,*.)

The same paper contains   an estimatealso of the additional liabilities in the economic field which we should necessarily be called upon to meet On theassumption that France is able to maintain an organised resistance to the- invader in a limited part of France, ordecides to&apos;res6rt to guerilla warfare in the west;      Finally,I have considered the extent to which it would be possible,short of military occupation,  to harness the resources ofthe Netherland, Belgian and French Colonial Empires to our war efforts notwithstanding the fall of their metropolitan territories.      Thus, the document.referred to above dischargesthe whole of the task remitted to me by the Yfer Cabinet at its meeting oh the 12th June (W.M.. (ho) 162nd Conclusions,Minute 9), with the exception of the problem of the extentto which we. must look to the Americas.in order to achievevictory;      This latter question is dealt with in the present memorandum.2. The conclusions emerging from the examination of this group of problems were summarised in the paper referred toabove, as follows:-      .--&apos;-&quot;.        .-..&apos;.&apos;the principal losses and gains in the economic sphere (l) to Germany and (2) to ourselves asthe result of the German invasion of Norway,Denmark,  the Netherlands, Belgium and Franceare&apos; the following&apos;:-(A)    Germany.(1)    Germany has acquired-(i) certain stoc^T nf which (apart&apos;  from munitions of war) the mostimportant are those of oil,&quot;certain metals. textile materials,..feeding stuffs and fats;   while
these are in some.cases considerable,  they are probably in no.easeso great as to relieve germany of further anxiety with regard toa material of which an acute-   shortage was previously to be feared;(ii)&apos;   the opportunity to secure any-surplus of the-current output of, these countries; of sucn gainsayfar the most important&quot; is.;,likelyto be the acquisition&apos;of?theLorraine -iron ore beds&apos;;    theimmediate value of these to Germany:.- wi 11 depend upon how far thepower stations and other. equipmentnecessary,to work them remainsintact;i -(iii)    a temporary gain of meat and -&apos;animal products, and of dairyproduce;    the extent of this will depend upon Germany&apos;s power toobtain f eeding-^-stuf f s, which &quot;Denmark and the Netherlands have largely imported from abroad;   if,as appears likely,  these are not forthcoming, the gain willessentially. be- short-lived;(iy)    a large accession of productivecapacity;    the extent to which&apos; Germany may expect to obtain ?:practical advantage from this source is discussed in the latter, - part of subsection (iii) ofparagraph 6 of the present memorandum,(2)    Germany has added to her difficulties in ifcwodirections:-(i)    it has become necessary for germany to make provision, on how-ever meagre a standard, of goods&quot;-      and foodstuffs of which her ownsupplies are limited to theinvaded countries where these have previously depended on imports froffljv.... other than German sources;(ii.) by&apos; losing the fringe of surrounding&apos;&apos;&quot; neutrals, Germany has lost her&apos; &quot;       opportunities of directly and indirectly circumventing our. ., blockade;
(B)    United KingdomThe economic effects upon the United Kingdom are less easy to estimate than those on.Germany, hut amongthe principal are the following;-- ...(1)    the United Kingdom has lost certain near and important sources of supplies:-(a) food imports, more particularly dairy andpig products, condensed- milk and margarine;(b) timber, of which the supply position was already very difficult;(c) flax, for \vhich it will be very difficultto find an alternative source;(d) iron ore;    the loss of North African and spanish supplies will greatly increase thedifficulty of working our furnaces at their full capacity;(2)    the main effect in the economic sphere has been to bring the war much closer to our own shores and ports and, by requiring diversion to the west eoa&amp;tports,  substantially to reduce our probable capacity to import;(3)    for this reason, any gain that we may secure inocean going shipping, by seizing or.bringing into our use more neutral tonnage than was- formerly atbur disposal, can probably serve only to increase our capacity to bring goods from a distance; ourreduced importing capacity makes it increasinglynecessary to bring in goods in manufactured formsin which they can more.easily be handled, and throwstherefore an increased- strain&apos;upon our resourcesof foreign.purchasing power;    thus the need for financial help, in particular for help.from theUnited States, has&apos; become more urgent;(h)    our losses maybe somewhat mitigated by., thepossibility that substantial&apos;assets, in the formof gold or negotiable securities formerly belongingto the invaded powers, may become available for ouruse;   but on the scale on&quot;which our needs are nowdeveloping, assistance will almost certainly benecessary,&apos;if we are to ,obtain from dollar and otherhard currency countries,.the physical resourcesnecessary to prosecute a successful war;if Prance had been able to maintain some form of militaryresistance in her metropolitan, territory or is able todo so from her North African territories, her dependence on us for various forms of assistance will be muchgreater than hitherto;    the amount of such,aid wouldvary according to the amount of the resistance she could offer:-
(i)    if.the&apos;French Army had been able to establish a shorter line in the south or the south-west, she would have had to he supplied from outside withalmost all her needs of coal, steel,  aluminium,textiles and leather, or in view of the loss ofher manufacturing capacity more probably withmanufactured munitionsj    she has lost also important, food producing areas, and if largenumbers of refugees were crowded into theremaining French area, food would have needed to be imported on-a. larger scale;(ii)    if *he French are able to maintain..isolated resistance of local guerilla warfare,her demands on us will be much less, andwill be mainly food, coal and textiles, inaddition to small arms and ammunition;(iii).   if resistance in metropolitan France.    . collapses, but the seat of the FrenchGovernment is transferred to north africa, and resistance is continued with.the aid of the French fleet and. such resources as. can be supplied from outside, the aid that we should be calledupon to provide would be similar to thateontejiplated in (i) above;finally, if French resistance collapseseverywhere,, we should provide no supplies ofany kind to the portions of French territoryoccupied by Germany;   however repugnant sucha course, it will be our imperative duty toprevent, supplies from reaching these areas,since the effect would he to releaseagricultural-and other labour for use byGermany in support of her war effort, andto diminish the administrative difficulties with which she would otherwise be facedothe resources of the Netherland, Belgian and French- colonial empires represent an important asset ofwhich.we should make the fullest possible use in thesupport of our war effort, notwithstanding&apos; anycomposition which the metropolitan Governments may.make with Germany;    the produce of these territoriescan to some extent be used directly for our own purposes, in particular some of the Belgian copperand of the rubber from the Netherland East Indies;their chief importance lies in their large exports toother countries, in particular to the United States,and in the resources in difficult currencies thatwe can thus secure;    in addition, as the resultof our increased control over raw material supplies,the maintenance of inter-allied regulation at the source has become a considerably more powerful instru-ment of economic warfare, and will be of considerable assistance in our negotiations with the U.S.S.R* and japan.- U -
3.       The situation which we have now to,face is the imminent,collapse of large-scale-military oppWitxoh to Germany in con-.continental Europe.-, the prospect that at an early date the full-furyof the; German&apos;.onslaught will he turhed against these Islands, asubstantial increase in our difficulties&apos;resulting from the entry of Italy, and perhaps even of Spain,  into the - war on the side of the enemy,, and the enormously&quot;&apos;Increased strain whichthese developments will impose on our resources both-economicand military. - These considerations all indicate In-the ,-clearest possible fashion.,that, however indomitable the- spiritof the country, the task of maintaining bur resistance&apos;until such time as our material resources have so increased&apos;as toenable us to attempt to achieve .&quot;a military decision againstthe, enemy will be&apos; well-nigh..insupportable unless we :are. ableto draw assistance on a large&apos;s&apos;cale from the Mew World.-if..       It is necessary therefore, at once.to consider in,what directions&apos; the Americas could come to.our aid, and toestimate the volume which that aid would need to assume if itis. to be sufficient to enable us to survive during the next twelve, months. .5. .,   &apos; There are four main directions., which this aid might take-.: -(i) The United States Government might themselvestake steps to prevent the&apos;export of goods which might be of assistance *to Germany-andItaly, and might use their good offices withthe other American Governments to ensure thatno such exports were permitted from any.part of the Americas^ &apos; &quot;: - -(ii) The United States Government might at oncedespatch to us existing supplies of warmaterial and of the raw materials-of war.   Animportant form of,such aid would be the releaseof naval vessels and the grant of permission to United States merchant ships to ply inthe European war zone which they are at- .. present debarred.from entering:.&apos;iii) The United States Government might obtain from congress authority for extensive credits tobe put at our disposal to provide us with.-&apos;   dollars with which to buy supplies for our war effort not only in the United States ofAmerica but. also\&apos;eIsewhere.(iv.) The United States &quot;Government might obtain- powers to.moboiise the manufacturing capacityof -the. United States of America in our support,The. extent- to which -we might&apos; obtain &amp;i&amp; under each of. these headsia examined below,,
II. THE EFFICACY OF THE WEAPON OF BLOCKADE.- 6.       Before estimating the extent to which the Americascould help us by agreeing to co-operate actively in theblockade through prohibiting the export to Germany and italy of goods of assistance to their war effort, it will be well toexamine briefly the results which we have so far achieved inthe field of economic warfare;    The preliminary appreciationprepared by the Chiefs of Staff, in consultation with theMinistry of Economic Warfare, in their report of 25th May, 191$ -(Paper W,P.(lj.O) 168) may perhaps be taken as the starting poin*for the present purpose.    The practical difficulties ofsecuring reliable quantitative data on the effect of a blockadare very great indeed, and these difficulties have probablynever been so great as they are to-day, owing to the exceptionalrigorous and efficient system of supervision over thedistribution of information imposed by the present regime, inGermanyj    Nevertheless, the Ministry of Economic Warfare has succeeded in. accumulating a large mass of evidence fromdiverse sources, which has been most carefully collated inorder to ascertain what conclusions may properly be drawn as   Ito the efficacy of the blockade.    The matter has been discussedclosely with the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and there is asubstantial measure of agreement;    there are, however, as mightfSbe expected, particular aspects of the matter where there aredifferences as to the degree of. significance that should he attached^    It must be emphasised that these conclusions depend Mupon certain hypotheses regarding the future course of military!events, in particular upon the hypothesis that we are able tocontinue to hold the Eastern Mediterranean and to deny to the  mGermans and Italians access to the oil wells of the Mosul area,!and that attack from the air on German key industrialinstallations and focal transport centres can be maintained.Subject to the foregoing explanations, wj^jare&apos; agreed that theposition may be fairly restated as follows:-(i) It is agreed that late in the winter of 19u1-l).l,there is likely to be a widespread shortage ofcertain foodstuffs in many industrial areas inEurope outside the Reich.-    Germany, &quot;like ot&amp;e?countries before her, will no doubt experiencedifficulty in extracting foodstuffs from the peasants for the benefit of the urban areas,but she may be relied upon to exert the maximumpressure to obtain supplies especially in thevast occupied territories which will now be at-  - her disposal.    She is not likely to recoil fromreducing the urban populations in these territories to a point where under-nourishmentwill be inevitable.    Even so, it is likely thatin the course of the coming winter there will 01shortages of particular foodstuffs in some ofGermany&apos;s own industrial areas.    The same islikely to be true of some at least of theindustrial areas in northern Italy.(ii)/lt is agreed that by the end of the winter/ (i..e. by. March 192+1) it is likely that GermanyI and Italy will have been forced to draw upon  their reserves of petroleum products to an extension] which will make impossible a war effortI on the scale maintained hitherto..   Much v/ill! depend, however, on the extent to which Germany! is forced to expend her oil supplies through ynemployment of her military forces in suppress^
91 qhi i *3isolated military: resistance or guerilla&quot;bands and generally in. holding, down,.  ,*&apos;.;&apos;increasingly hostile subject.populations;In the light of the. information at their disposal, the Ministry of Economic Warfareconsider that, owing to raw material shortagesGermany will experience difficulty in finding equipment at the rate required tomaintain.an Army in.the field of itspresent, size and with the scale of equipment which Germany possessed at the beginning ofthe present offensive.     It is likely thatthese difficulties will be felt even more strongly by Italy, whose initial equipementis both poorer in quality and more scantyin amount than- that with which the Germansstarted the war, and whose capacity toreplace wastage is far weaker than that ofGermany,It is likely that in the next fewmonths, there will be a widespread dis-organisation of industry within the areasrecently acquired by Germany, resultingfrom such causes as the shortage of par/tic-ular raw materials, . the partial destructionof plants from air action, the disorganisat-tion of internal transport for similar;;reasons , the dispersal of skilled :arid other workers , and the obstructive attitude&apos; ofthose that remain.   In so far as this provesto be the case, we may expect to see alarge part of the manufacturing capacity in the occupied territories standing idle,with a consequently high rate of unem loy-ment in the conquered industrial areas.The existence-of large.concentrations ofunemployed industrial workers would throwa further heavy strain on the Germanadministrative machine, . It is unlikely,however, that the Germans would permit -a dangerous situation of .this kind to endurefor any length of time, and it is^thereforereasonable to expect that the Germans&apos;.willtake, steps to deal with it either, bydiverting manufacturingalternative uses, where-technically and throughalternative raw materials or by breaking up dangerously large concentrations &quot;of. un-employed workers by moving them to.improvisedpublic&apos;works, such&apos;as the improvement 6fcommunications, the construction of newfortifications, or the maintenance ofagricultural output.      Here again it ispossible that the position of Italy may prove to be the Achilles heel ihcapacity of Italy to adaptindustrial strains imposedcapacity toit is^ possible boththe existence ,ofthe Axis;1&apos; :- &quot;Theherself to the by the blockadeisoflikely toGermany.be considerably less than that
7* From the situation disclosed above, which givesground for considerable hope that the situation next yea^will be far more favourable to uss it is possible to drawtwo broad conclusions, in both of which the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare concur;)(i) the maintenance of, and so far; as possiblethe intensification of the blockade must   &apos;be regarded as constituting an essential element in any plan for the ultimate defeat of the enemyj(ii) the weapon of blockade, though of greatimportance, is essentially a subsidiaryarm;    it is not one which, by itself is capable of achieving Victory,   Shis willnot be obtained until . our resources are such as to enable us to force&apos; an issueby battleo .III. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE AMERICASCOULD RE-INFORGE OUR BLOCKADE.8* The extent to which Germany has been able directly to import from anywhere in the Americas since the impositionof the blockade is negligible.     In so far as she has obtainsupplies from this source she has done so through neutral or?&quot;non-belligerent&quot; channelsi     The entry of Italy into the warCloses what has probably been the most important channel,though for material of high military value and small bulkGermany may still be able to rely on obtaining supplies byway of Vladivostok and the Trans-Siberian Railway.9* The fact that supplies to Germany from the Americashave probably been relatively small is not to imply thatthe active co-operation of the American Governments would beof but little advantage to us.    Indeed, the contrary is thecase, since if those Governments desired to send supplies toGermany and Italy and we were not in a position to prevent it through the use of naval power, the Americas between them could provide the enemy with the greater part of his require-ments.     The most important commodities cut off from German-occupied territories by the blockade are non-ferrous metals,oils, rubber, and textile fibres0     The United States by itself could supply all these in large quantities (exceptrubber), and complete stoppage here would be essential.    Bu&apos;even if such action were taken by the United States, thecentral and south American countries could., provide the enemywith large quantities of essential raw materials.     Mexico,Venezuela, Colombia, and Cuba could provide Germany with the major part of her oil requirements if tankers were available.Except for the United States, Chile is the world&apos;s largestproducer of copper;   Mexico is the world&apos;s largest producer of lead, and Chile of vanadium ore.      In addition&apos;, thecentral and south Americafe produce important quantities ofmanganese ore, molybdenum ore, and tungsten ore.     Braziland Argentina could provide Germany with large quantitiesof raw cotton.     In fact, if the resources of SouthAmerica were open to Germany, the only commodity of which she might eventually find herself short would be
rubbero     Tfcus the whole-hearted co-operation of the Americaswith us in enforcing the blockade&apos;by curtailing potentialsources^of supply would be of the utmost Value,^and would afford a very substantial relief to the Royal   j?avy by freeingships engaged on blockade duties for service elsewhere, a consideration which is to-day. probably of greater, importance than ever before in view of the entry of Italy into.the war.10c      There are various other ways also in which the full co-operation of the Americas in the re-re-inforcement of theblockade would be of great value,      For example, German supplyships would find it far more difficult to find American portsfrom which to supply German commerce raiders^     Again, it shouldbe possible much more readily than hitherto to prevent Germanpfrom leaving the American Continent in order to return toGermany, either for military service or for employment asskilled operatives in the munitions industries.IV,     THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF-DESTROYINGOgRMMI-RRQDUCTrTB CAPACITY.11.      The active collaboration of the United.. States, with thepossibility which it opens of obtaining large supplies&quot; ofmunitions from an area outside the range of iiiimediate hostilities-ties, would open up one predominant opportunity,,      In Europehitherto,  the war has taken the form of the opposition of twoflows of the current production of munitions, that of germany on - the one hand,  that of the Allies on the other 0      In-eachcase, the flow has been supplemented by the possession-of certaininitial stocks of munitions,: that of Germany very much greaterthan our own0     If we were to enter a period of fierce air-warfare,resulting in the destruction of the opposing munition factories,the form of the war would change from that of a,rivalry of thecurrent outputs of munitions, to a rivalry of the&apos; existing stocksiof.munitions,      In such a phase, the advantage which GermanyJenjoys through her numerical preponderence in aircraft would:almost: certainly be increasede     The prospect of. American co-Joperation opens up a possibility that could be turned greatly!to bur advantage, the possibility of a war of current munitionsjoutput on our own side against the existing stock of. munitionson the German side.. .    .     &quot;12.      The chance of exploiting this advantage^depends upontwo main issues (&amp;) upon our own power to destroy the German--munitions factories,  (b) upon our power to hold out until theAmerican production drive gives us first parity and finallyoverwhelming superiority in the air, ..    It would be unreasonable to expect that - overwhelming air siiperiority could be .achievedbefore many months have elapsedo      The problem is thus - to findmeans to bridge this intervals&apos;13o     Clearly our object should be to frustrate, the Ge&quot;rman -attempts to maintain munitions.--production.    &quot;For this purposewe- should aim at doing.the maximum of damage to those, types of factories which would take longest to., replace and whichhold a key position in the whole scheme.of munitions output.Without underestimating the value&apos; to immediate military&apos;operations of attacking oil installations and oil-refineriesand the focaD. points in the German transport&apos; system, it isimportant to realise that on a longer view the prospect ofour achieving a substantial superiority in equipment at thetime that the final issue is&apos;fought out depends Very largely
on the success with which we are able now by air action todisable Germany&apos;s main electrical and gas supplies, andmetallurgical,, -chemical.and manufacturing equipment, includln. blast furnaces, steel furnaces, coke ovens, and rolling milVs^and aircraft and other munition factories..     if the maximum  &apos;- of dislocation is to be caused in this respect, efforts wouldprobably best be concentrated upon achieving the greatest;j, percentage destruction of one particular process, such as blast&apos;j , furnaces or coke ovens.     A large scale destruction of these could probably not be remedied within a year.      The successfulapplication of a bombing policy of this kind would enormously. :.strengthen the effect of the blockade?- - V V.    THE IMMEDIATE OUTLOOK FOR OBTAINING; &apos;      SUPPLIES AND MUNITIONS AND IIlDUSTRIALV EQUIPMENT FROM THE AMERICAS.14.      It would be unwise to be over sanguine as to the.possibilities of obtaining from the United States within thevery near future large quantities of the types of manufacturedwar equipment of which we are in shortest supplies,.     Up to thepresent, we have, obtained from the United States little beyondconsiderable quantities of small arms ammunition and a certainamount of small arms.    In addition, a relatively small numberof aircraft have been received either by this country directlyI tor by. Canada..     On the basis hitherto envisaged, it has been,7   anticipated that in the six months ending October next, the.; United States will be able, to provide us with 150 aircraftf] I for. operational purposes (Appendix Do Paper Wo P.  (U-Oj 163).I I If French resistance ceases, this number, may.well be increased,I. j for larger numbers of aircraft have been received by France-I1, than.-by this country..  .15*      There remains the possibility that the United-States)   Government might be prepared to denude their operational units-in order to provide us with aircraft..at the earliest possiblemomentj but, apart from this possibility the scope of whichI am not in a position to estimate in quantitive terms, theprospects of our obtaining in the near future aircraft in any- -considerable quantities from: the United States ! cannot be. re-- garded as hopeful.      The question whether, and if so, to&apos;what.extent increased productive capacity can be made availabledepends on various factors discussed in the later part ofthis memorandum.     For the present purpose, it is sufficientto note that even in the most favourable circumstances no immediate relief of importance can be looked for from1 this source,., and that in the most favourable conditions many&apos;months; must elapse before any large increase in the rate of outputcan be achieved.      It is clear therefore that for the remainder;:of this year at least, and probably longer, the bulk of theaircraft which we require must.be produced in this country.16.     American capacity at present devoted to the manufacture   jjof anti-aircraft guns, anti-tank guns, tanks, is trifling&apos;       Jjand isy in.the main,.engaged already on order for the United    j-States.Army or for the Allies.     New additional capacity could Jj-Only be brought into operation within eight to twelve months;given sufficient energy, it should be possible to secure increafaoutput at a considerably earlier date through the conversionof existing plants.
-17....   . As regards the means to prosecute&apos; sea warfare and toirialn axxi^vhe --delay^sry of essential imports to this .country, itis&apos; likely^-that the United States could provide .us -with more&apos;immediate help..... The question whether,  and if so to what&apos;extent the United States might be prepared to. supply us withnaval vessels, falls outside the scope of the present       .&apos;&apos;&apos;:;,rflemorandUm; , but as. regains merchant shipping, there is nodoubt that many of our own difficulties would be resolvedif th^vUiiiiea^S^tates : Government withdrew the bar by whichships flying the United States flag&apos;are prohibited from;entering the war zone in Europe,&apos;. and instead.-permitted such,ships to&apos; carry imports to. this country,, - This problem would,become one of increasing importance . if through an :lntensifi-cation of air action or of U-boat warfare our rate of losses were.to rise at all. .steeply *    For the/moment, however, our main pre-occupation is not so much the amount of dead-weight   .. shipping Capacity at our-disposal .as.the likelihood that.. V &apos;Under conditions of total war the capacity of our,ports aftertraffic has been concentrated on the west coast will be in^,-ade.qua.te to handle the volume of imports we require...     - --&apos;&quot;&apos;.&apos; IV. &quot; THE GRAITT OF EXTENSIVE CREDITSBY THE .UNITED STATES. ..&apos;,&apos;18.       Of-the various economic ways in which the United states could come to our aid. immediately,  there is no single-measure which would afford us more rapid pr-riso-re important reliefthan the removal of the&apos; preaej.it bar&apos; on the grant _t.Q_.us of loans&quot; and creditsIn order to procTor^TProla abroad themate-r-iaTs and manufactures necessary to the conduct of thewar, it is not enough that the materials and manufactures&apos;&apos; ..should exist,  it is necessary also that we should, have&quot;the&apos;/. : .money to buy them,    At the present time; before we buy -anything from abroad we are compelled to consider carefully.,the limitations of our. store of foreign assets.&apos;  In order toconserve1 our supplies-of exchange we are&apos;&quot;compelled to resort to all kinds of arts and strategemsj    we are forced to&quot;. ,;,&apos;;&apos;retain in the export trade large numbers of skilled workers who,might be diverted to the production of war materials&apos;.&apos;,&apos;-We,.are. compelled to use. shipping tonnage to import raw.       ..material,to be worked upfgr subsequent export,. ; American--/    &quot; -credits would relieve us Of - all this and , allow us- tp&apos;: eonceh--trate our man-power en war production and military&apos;service,&apos;.    .:and to: procure fi^om abroad war material, up to -the limit of;foreign capacity to supply it,    The reversal of:the prohibition,on the granting, of credits and long term loans-, is therefore ,one of the major ways in.which the United States could aidour efforts&quot; immediately.. , So important, indeed,&quot; is such achange of policy that we. should be prepared&apos;to make any reasonable  jolitical concession in order to secure - it.,
VIIi  THE UNITED STATES AS A IVAR ARSENAL.19.       The vital role of the aircraft and the armouredvehicle in modern   warfare makes it possible to measurewar potential almost exclusivelj&apos;- in terms of the man-power plant, and raw materials available in the engineering trades.    The economic potentialities of the United States   &apos;are so great that within a period of about a year it&apos;,should be possible, by converting existing capacity to war production, to turn out enormous numbers of armouredvehicles and also aircraft in sufficient quantities to goa long way towards removing the present disparity betweenthe German total of front-line aircraft and our own.       - -Thereafter, the rate of output should increase so greatlythat we should be able to convert, this country Into aheaviljr armed fortress and to bring, these resources to bear upon Germans/ in such strength as to bring us victory.ISO.       The engineering trades in the United States are threegor four times lax^ger than our own.    The makers of agriculturalflliiachinery&apos;and the railway repair shops employ over 200,000jjworkers * some eight times the total number of workers nowJfengaged- in this country in the manufacture, of tanks and^jarmoured vehicles.    The output of machine tools in theUnited States is four times, greater and that of motor vehicles almost ten times greater than that in G-reat Britain.The experience of the first nine months of the war in thiscountry suggests that such labour and plant capacits?&quot; can-beswitched over with great rapidity&apos;from peace-time purposesto war uses, particularly to the manufacture of aircraft,and:tanks. -21.        If the United States is to render effective economic aid xn  he defeat of Germany, important changes will benecessary in the internal economy of the^United States^and inthe economic - relations dotwcen the United States and the ,,British Empire.22.    . The United States can only give us effective assistancein the production of aircraft and armoured vehicles if, in.certain vital directions, means can be found to reduce.thelevel of consumption in the United States.    Our own war effortat-its present level has required the employment of about1:? million skilled engineers.    An effort on a scale sufficientto give us overwhelming superiority in the air might wellrequire, even if American productivits?- per head is, muchgreater than bur own, a concentration on war. effort, in theUnited States comparable with our own, and could only beachieved if that country were prepared to accept.,restrictions oh the consumption of certain commodities.It would be. necessary, for instance,  to reduce the output of motor cars for civilian purposes and to divert many rawmaterials from domestic to war purposes.   Unless the american public are prepared to impose upon themselves a self-denyingordinance of this kind serious Shortages of essential rawmaterials must be expected.    Indeed, there is already a potential shortage in steel supplies.   At the moment, theUnited States steel industry is working at almost fullcapacitjr.    Some relief to the industry maybe expected ifPrance goes out of the war.    But bur own demands for steel from the United States majy be expected to increase in thenext few months and, unless domestic consumption in theUnited States is reduced, so acute a shortage might developas to impair the war effort of both countries.

If the economic resources of the United States were fully pledged to the defeat of Germany, it would he important for that country to spare no effort to bring about a swiftdiversion of industrial effort to war purposes0      In the last war,, despite the enormous energy and.enthusiasm with whichthe United States undertook the task of raising and equippingher fighting forces, it; was a consid&amp;refoio&apos; t&amp;.me before the firsteffects became evidente      The.

American aid will probably be much more effective ifit takes the form Of a rapid improvisation of production with existing industrial equipment and plant capacity,, rather thana long-term programme preceded.by .a lengthy period of constructsional activity0VIII o    possible^.;:^^AI^te^- OF&apos;F0PUIATiH6NV25.       Nothing has yet been said of the obvious importanceof developing the resources Hot pxily of&apos;the United States butalso of the Empire itself, in particular of Canada.   ; -Thepossibilities that exist in the United States of   expandingproduction outside the immediate zone of hostilities apply equally to Canada,      As in the United States, the limitations
on expansion are partly those of raw materials, partly of skilled man-power.     It is for consideration whether, in theevent of the destruction of our own factories, it may not hethe hest policy to evacuate skilled.lahour on a large scale to Canada and to secure there better working conditions witherthe interruptions of mtbrttttconsequent upon air-raids, and     1without the reductions of output which are one of their chief consequences.26.       There are further possibilities of migration whichmay become of increasing importance when the enemy develops ffull force of his attack.      Our own power to survive the peridduring which United States production could be built up, must depend partly upon military considerations, partly uponeconomic considerations.      In the latter field, the mostimportant factor may become our power to continue to feed thepopulation under siege conditions.     A reduction of each1 million In the number to be fed would reduce   by about \ minitons the necessary volume of imports.      It is for. consideraticjwhether within the limits of outgoing shipping capacity itwould not be of advantage to encourage the transfer for thetime being of women and children to the American continent.IX.    SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS.27*       The principal conclusions which emerge from the fore-going analysis are the followings-(1) In the economic sphere there are four main ways inwhich the New World can come to the assistance ofthe Old.      The United States Government:(a) might themselves take steps to prevent the exporjof goods which might be of assistance to Germany;and Italy, and might use their good offices witflthe other American Governments to ensure that no:such exports were permitted from any part of the;Americas;(b) might at once despatch to us existing supplies ojwar material and of the raw materials of war;important form of such aid would be the releaseof naval vessels and the grant of permission to united States merchant ships to ply in theEuropean war zone which they are at presentdebarred from entering;&apos;($-),might obtain from Congress authority for exten-sive credits to be put at our disposal to providtus with dollars with which to buy supplies forour war effort not only in the United States ofAmerica but also elsewhere;(d) might obtain powers to mobilise the manufaf/turin^   . capacity of the United States of America in our&apos; * support.- Ik -

This will notthough of great import-subsidiary arm;    it isis capable of achievingbe obtained until our resources-are suchan issue by battleas to enable us to force the task of blockading Germany would be eno^rrnouslyassisted if we could count on the active co-oper-ation of the United States and, under her aegis,on that of the rest of the Americas:    South America.1ma&quot;possesses nearly amost needs, and.if thecurtailed at the source thethe task of the Royal. Navy,erials which GermanyAmerican Governmentspotential supplies,complicated by Italy&apos;sentry into the war, would be. materially lightened;if South American ports were not available to Germansupply ships, German commerce raiding would be far more difficult.    It should also be easier to preventthe return to Germany of German&apos; experts and otherresidents abroad. - -The active collaboration of the United States would open up one predominant-. opportunity - that ofopposing a continuous flow of new output of aircraft and munitions to the existing - stocks of suchweapons possessed by Germany.    That opportunitydepends upon our ability to. destroy German industrialplant, and to hold out ourselves&apos;until the Americanproduction drive gave.us first parity and finallyoverwhelming superiority,,    With the progressiveincrease in the output-of aircraft .&apos;.and munitions iinthe United States, we should be able to convertthis country into an armed fortress and-to bring these resources &quot; o bear on Germany .&apos;.in such strengthas to bring us victory,,    In order to minimise thedanger of the&apos; immediate phase, we&apos; should &quot;concentrate on doing the utmost damage to ;&apos;those key processes and types of industrial plant in Germany and the occupied&apos;countries which-take the longest to replace.(5) We cannot expect that large quantities of munitionswill be quickly available from the United States.Deliveries of new munitions and aircraft havehitherto been on a very small scale, and apart fromthe possibility that the United-States may be pre-pared to denude her own operational&apos; units of equipment,  it.must be some months-at least before any large increase in the rate of output can beachieved;   .for this period we must depend mainly onour own resources.    This consideration applieswith particular force to the supply of aircraft.
mm(8)(?)(10)(11)The rapid adaptation of United States industries to war production through placing the country onvirtually a war footing and the achievement of a scale of output sufficient to give us overwhelmingsuperiority must involve substantial reductlons in civilian consumption in the Unite a tj-oa-oes. &quot;&quot;This-will &quot;apply particularly to steel, the output ofwhich is already approaching capacity.(7)oeFor American aid to be most effective it willnecessary to establish&apos; a proper division offunction between the American economy and our own.It will in some cases be possible for us to secure ifrom America imports of raw materials or of finishedgoods, but not of both? -Aluminium supplies afford -an example of this; it may be necessary for us toprovide some of the requisite material from Canadian!sources. Similarly, in the case of machine toolsthe relative priorities of United States and Britisfmanufacturers will be required to be determined.If the United States is to provide the most imraediataid, that can probably be best achieved by rapidimwSSM^^m^tJ9 2^^on with existing equipment;rather than by a long-term programme preceded by alengthy period of construction.      It will be recalls!that during 1917-18, despite great energy and enthusiasm, it took some fifteen months for United IStates&apos; output to become effective in the field.Of all the various ways in which the United States i could come to our aid immediately, no single measure4could afford us more rapid and important reliefthan the removal of the present ban on the grant offloans and credits.     Such credits would relieveus of the pressing anxiety regarding the amount ofour foreign assets which till now have necessarilyput a brake on foreign purchases, and such credits would allow us to concentrate our man power on war production and military service, and to procurefrom abroad war material up to the limit of foreigncapacity to supply it.      In order to obtain such a Ichange of policy we should be prepared to make any \reasonable political concession.xv importsbe permitted to enterthus able to carry -,tance In this manner:It would greatly assist us in maintainingif United States shipping could the war zone in Europe and wereimports to this country,.    Assiwould become one of increasing importance if through!an intensification of air action or of U-boat warfareour rate of losses were to rise at all steeply*It is fully as important to developof Canada as of the United states.&apos;the resources   IThe limitations!are^partly those of raw materials and equipment,partly of&apos; man power.      If our own factories aredestroyed, it is for consideration whether, on the analogy of the Empire Air Training Scheme, it maynot be the best policy to transfer skilled labour on a large scale to Canada where it can work un-mterruptedly and avoid the reductions of outputconsequent even upon unsuccessful air attacks.
(3.2) Our ;:;ower to stxrvive the period until theassistance of the United States can become fully effective will depend largely on our power to import.    The smaller the population to be fed,-, the less will our difficulties be.A reduction of 1 million mouths would diminishovu? necessary imports by about half a million tons.    It is for consideration whether it maynot prove to be of advantage to transfer tothe American Continent such number of womenarid ehildijen as outgoing shipping can carry. -(Intd.) A.
