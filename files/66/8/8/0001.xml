(4:0)173.(Also 0*0. S. (40)406).P.9TH MAY.  1940.WAR CABINET.INVASION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.As miliary advisers to the Government v.e have thought it right to place before the War Cabinet, as amatter of urgency, our views as to the possible course ofevents in the n:sar future.2. Germany may -(a) Concentrate her main effort upon destroying the French Army with a view to eliminating the French from the war at an early stage.(b) Stabilise the front in France for the momenton approximately the present lines and concentrate on a major attack against great Britain.3. The British Empire is Germany&apos;s main enemy and,if she can defeat us, the subsequent capitulation ofFrance follows as a matter of course.4. We must, unfortunately, face the fact that aresolute counter attack by the French Army on a suffi-ciently large scale to keep the German Army and AirForce fully extended is tmlikely in the near future.COPY NO.     g^O

.5- In our view, therefore, it is highly probablethat Germany is now setting the stage for delivering afull scale attack on England.6, We are not satisfied, from the military point ofview,  that in the face of this danger the country asa whole has been sufficiently warned, or adequatelyorganised, to meet the threat on which the fnte of our land, and Empire may depend.7. We have made a comprehensive study in the past few weeks of the probable and possible methods of attack, which Germany might employ against this country,and our views are set out in a number of reports whichhave been submitted to the War Cabinet.     these reports and other directives have been circulated tothe Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces.      We are sure thathe is acting with great vigour and organising the defences of the country as rapidly as possible.8. We have, however, recenty received reportsof a new form of attack which has not, as far as weare aware, been hitherto seriously considered.     Wethink it possible that the Germans may employ alarge fleet of fast motor boats (poss: bly up to 200)carrying 100 men apiece to carry out a seaborne raid on alarge scale.      These boats could be assembled without undue evidence at a number of ports in Germany andpossibly in Holland.     They could make the passageof the North Sea during the dark hours.

These boats would be handled with the utmostboldness and would probably be run up on the beaches without regard to loss of the craft or casualties to the personnel.By this means we consider that a considerable force of theenemy could, be landed at many points on the coastsimultaneously with air-borne raids inland.    ;..&apos;e do notconsider that by naval or air action we could prevent such a landing.9* The basis of our present plan of defence is to employ a number of mobile columns, tacticallydisposed,, which would be rushed to the threatened  .....places as soon as information       received of a landing.10.       We have always held that the most hazardous phase of a combined operation is the actual landing of the menon the beach against opposition.   Unless, therefore, we canensure that the enemy is met on the beach by every possibleform of defence, guns (within the limt of the numbersavailable) rifle fire, wire, obstacles and demolitions, hemay get that first and all-important foot-hold on ourterritory which will enable larger and heavier forces tobe landed subsequently.We have ample evidence of the difficulty ofdislodging the German once he has established himself on enemy soil.11.       In our view it would not be right to assume that theGermans will take their time about preparing to launchthe attack.  &apos;

The late Cormmander-ih-Chief, Hone Forces, asked us to inform him when the Chiefs of Staff considered anattack was imminent.    Uo think that General Ironsideshould he so informed now.(a) That the country should be warned androused to the imminent danger.(b) That the Amy at home should be broughtto a high degree of alertness particularly at night,(c) The    Coirunander-in-Chief,  Home Forces,should be instructed to review hisdispositions in the light of paragraphs 6-8above.(d) That all labour facilities required toput the beaches on the Yorkshire Coast,in East Anglia, on the South Eastand South coast as far as ^ewhavenin a state of defence should be mobilised.and the necessary work put in handwithout a mementos-delayForces to implement recommendations (b) nnd (c) above as a matter of urgency.12.We recommend -13.We have requested the commander-in-Chief, Home(Signed) T.S.V.
