THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is- requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.sj: G g EW.P,(40) 185.(AL30 0.0,3.(40) 410),BOTH MAY, 1940.COPY NO.Alo51WAR CABINET.EIRE.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.We have been considering the advantages which germany might hope to obtain if Eire maintains her preeentattitude of neutrality and the steps which, from themilitary point it is desirable to take to minimise these advantages.Strategical Importance of Eire to Germany.2, Germany might attempt to establish air bases in Eirewith the object of harassing our shipping in the western approaches:    attacking our West Coast ports, and objectives in the United Kingdom, from a position behind our defences:attacking the aircraft and shipping industry in NorthernIreland:    or even,.launching a subsidiary &quot;&quot;airborne invasion of England as a diversion during. a..&apos;f.ull scale seaborneinvasion ..of-the East Coast.To make such action effective the provision of essential supplies by sea would be necessary, unless itwere possible to lay in stocks beforehand by clandestinemeans.3. Germany might take advantage of the grievances of theI.R.A., particularly over the &quot;partition&quot; question, tofoment a rising in Eire.     Such action might lead to theoverthrov/ of the existing Government;   might enlist the sympathy of the Eire armed forces;    and might eventuallylead to attacks on Northern&apos;Ireland.     The effect of internaltrouble in Eire would be, at the least a reduction in food supplies available for the United Kingdom, and at the worsta diversion of our forces at what is likely to be acritical time,  and a threat to the important industries inNorthern Ireland,

4, Germany might also attempt to establish bases onthe Irish Coast for submarines and small surface craft inorder to intensify her attacks on our shipping in theWestern Approaches.Possible German Methods of setting about occupation of Eire.5. The most probable method of obtaining the facilitiesshe requires in Ireland would be for Germany to landparachute troops to seize landing grounds,  followed laterby airborne troops.      For this purpose the Germans have available 30 four-engined aircraft (J. U.90s and F.W.200s),the  carrying capacity of each of which is 40, as well as500 J.U.   52s each capable of carrying 15,Other possible methods are landing from neutral ships,  including German ships disguised as neutrals, andfrom submarines.      German ships are known to be assembledin Spanish ports and shipping is doubtless also availablein Norway,6. The Eire army is poorly equipped and consists only of some 8000 regular troops,      The Eire air force is notcapable of offering any effective resistance in the air and Eire has only one or two anti-aircraft guns.      Inaddition there are numerous German sympathisers in thecountry.      The coast watching service is said to beinefficient,,Disadvantages^ to us of Eire Neutrality.7. So long as Eire remains neutral,  Germany gainscertain advantages which assist her in the general pro-secution of the war.        The maintenance of diplomatic relations with Germany,  involving a German Minister and staff and diplomatic immunity for correspondence,  obviouslyfacilitates intelligence work and the transmission ofinformation,,    There are firms with German connections:German subjects are not interned:    and it is quite impossibleto stop completely the leakage of information from GreatBritain and Northern Ireland to Eire for re-transmissionto Germany.8. These conditions also facilitate preparations forany action which Germany may wish to take in Eire.      Itshould be comparatively easy for German agitators to make contact with members of the I.R0A.  and other sympathisers:to arrange for military stores and supplies for aircraft tobe laid down:    oro refuelling facilities to be provided forsubmarine s.90 While Eire remains neutral,  British military assis-tance cannot be called in until an emergency actually arises.In view of the weakness of the Eire armed forces,  this mightwell prove too late to attack the initial enemy landings andto prevent the trouble proving into a serious commitment.Our troops and air fo-cos would have to operate in unfamiliarcountry, with no   .... sting facilities for supplies, petrollanding ground-.,  etc.

10.        Finally the neutrality of Eire prevents us from making use of Irish ports in particular Berehaven.      Theneed for this base has been recognised as an urgent require-ment since the outbreak of war.      Briefly,  Berehaven isrequired; --(i)   As an advanced destroyer and flying boat baseto enable convoy escorts to be extendedfurther to the West;(ii)   As a . &quot;base for anti-submarine hunting units,both destroyers and trawlers,  operating offthe south and south-west coasts of Eire;(iii)   As a possible operational base for heavy ships and cruisers which might be required toprovide cover for our light forces in theWestern Approaches;(iv)   As a base for salvage tugs (one has already beenstationed there with the consent of the eire government),The Western Approaches are our most vulnerable area for submarine attack on trade,      With the Channel ports inGerman hands,  the scale of attack is likely to increase if germany and possibly Italy are able to make use of these ports as submarine bases.      Our light forces, are unable to operate from their present bases at Plymouth and milford haven further west than longitude 14c,      Enemy submarineshave operated in the focal area to the West of this longitude,and it is imperative that our anti-submarine escorts shouldbe extended further to the west,      By the use of Berehavenwe should be able to operate a further 180 miles west than is - possible from bases in the United Kingdom,Furthermore,  it may become necessary to base covering force in the approaches to the Channel and the WestCoast ports.        Berehaven if adequately defended would meet this requirements      Its detenee has not -yet been undertaken on account of Eire -s attitude of neutrality,  and booms arenot immediately available.Conclusions on the^.....Strategic  advantage to Germany of Eire.llo        Our conclusions are that a neutral Eire assistsGermany in the general prosecution of the war,  and deniesto us the use of important naval bases.      Moreover,  theGermans are provided with opportunities for making prepara-tions for carrying out their plans.      Finally,  Germanoperations from Eire would constitute a serious threat toour shipping in the Western Approaches, to the West coast ports and to Northern&apos;Ireland,    They^ might also prove anembarassing diversion to our naval and air forces at acritical period,It is tiioroforc clearly to our advantage, from themilitary point- of view,  that Eire should range herselfopenly on our side without delay.

The Attitude of the Government of IDire.12. On the 23rd May, Mr, de Valera conveyed to theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs the followingmessages:-(i)    Mr.  de Valera wished to assure us that therewas no question at all hut that Eire wouldfight if attacked by Germany and would callin the assistance of the United Kingdom themoment it beoame necessary.(ii)    The political situation in Eire was such thatthere could be no question of the eire government inviting in United Kingdom troopsbefore an actual German descent and beforefighting between the German and Eire forces had begun,      If the United Kingdom forcesarrived before such fighting had taken place,Mr. de Valera could not be responsible forthe p&quot;dl.political consequences.      If,  on theother hand,  fighting was in progress betweenEire and German forces and the United kingdom forces came in to help,  Eire opinion wouldgive whole-hearted support to the british forces.(iii)    Mr. .de Valera wished to assure us that he didnot feel any danger on the internal side from local fifth columnists,  etc.      All suspectsin Eire were under watch and he was satisfiedthat the Eire authorities had full controlof these.13.        It will be seen that Mr., de Valera insists on main-taining his present attitude of neutrality until the actualGerman attack takes place and Irish Forces become engaged.He did, however,  suggest that immediate secret contactsBhouitd---b^-est-abiirs-hed.^between the&quot; Irish Military Authoritiesand Service Staffs in :5hls^country with a view to concertingthe military action which would be taken when the occasion arises.14.        This offer was,  of coarse, accepted and secretconversations have taken place both in London and in Dublinand are still continuing.      The opportunity of these conversations was taken to urge that the Government of Eireshould take the following precautionary measures(a) Preparations to prevent enemy landings ataerodromes and seaplane bases0(b) Preparations to prevent the enemy from seizingports.(c) Preparations to enable the Irish Government todeal effectively with Fifth Column activities,including the supervision of the GermanLegation and German firms.(d) Preparations to enable stocks of petrol in thevicinity of landing grounds to be destroyedquioklT  in the event of a German landing.

(e) A black-out of the whole country(f) Arrangements to search all shipping in andapproaching Irish ports with a view tolocating troops, munitions, refugees andsuspicious characters.,To assist the Irish Government in the above9 we have placed at their disposal all available intelligence inrespect of German methods and we have offered the resultsof our experience in the preparation of plans for thedefence of the United Kingdom.15.       The results have been most encouraging and the IrishAuthorities have, we understand, been impressed with thenecessity for making thorough preparations.      They are, wethink somewhat too confident in their ability to deal withinternal subversive activities, which if exploited by german agents might well reach formidable proportionso   Onthe other hand arrangements to implement most of the abovemeasures are now in hand? and the Irish Authorities haveshown a genuine desire to co-operateol6o The Irish Government have been informed that whenthe call for assistance comes they may expect to receivedirect support, as far as land forces are concerned, fromthe General Officer Commanding? Northern Ireland districtoStaff Officers from Headquarters Northern Ireland have attended the conversations in Dublin and detailed planningis now proceeding.     Similarly discussions are proceeding as to the best methods by which our air forces can assistfrom bases in the United Kingdom.17. Since clearly very early information of german invasion or raids on Eire is essential, and the cable willprobably be cut at once, arrangements are in hand by the WarOffice and the Air Ministry to supplement existing communica-tions   for Dublin to the Department of Defence in NorthernIreland, and also to the War Office.     A special wireless setis to be provided for   Sir John Maffey.18. In order to advise the Irish Government on problemsof defence, and to establish a close liaison between theIrish Military Authorities and Headquarters in Belfast and london, we propose, subject to Mr* de Valera!s agreement,to appoint Military and Air Attaches to Dublin. In viewof the necessity for concealing the fact that discussions between the two Staffs are proceeding, these appointmentswill probably have to be camouflaged^,Rs commendat ions. .19.       We invite the approval of the War Cabinet to the abovearrangements and in particular to the principle that military support should be provided to the Government of Eire immediatelyit is called for.     We must emphasise, however, that thisarrangement, together with the steps being taken by theGovernment of Eire, will not secure Eire against the danger that threatens her.     Until she abandons her attitude of neutrality she cannot fully safeguard herself against dangerof enemy -activities   within her territory, nor obtain the full co-operation of our forces to anticipate and resist attackoUnless this security nan be achieved, Eire will remain aserious weakness in the aef-en.ce of these Islandso     But how this should be done is a matter outside our province.(Signed) C.L.N.
