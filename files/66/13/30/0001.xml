THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECRET. Copy No..W.P. (40) 450.November 18, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.CHEMICAL WARFARE.Report by the Lord Privy Seal.Introductory.ON the 9th October I was invited by the War Cabinet to enquire why thedirection given by the Cabinet in November 1938 to increase the storage reserve for gas from 500 to 2,000 tons had not been fully carried out. Constitutionallythe responsibility for this matter must rest primarily with the Minister in chargeof the responsible Department, namely, the Secretary of State for War, for theperiod November 1938 until the Ministry of Supply was established in the summer of 1939, and thereafter the Minister of Supply. The responsible Officer for theprovision of gas under these two Ministers throughout the relevant period wasSir Harold Brown, who was the Member of the Army Council in charge of supplymatters, and passed to the Ministry of Supply when that Ministry was set up.2. But it would not be right to attribute to any one individual the responsi-bility for failure to carry out this decision of the Cabinet. Indeed, I believe thatthe failure to implement the decision arose mainly from serious defects in organisation. The provision of increased storage for gas was, of course, onlyone among a very large number of items in the War Office programme which itwas the duty of the Member of the Army Council in charge of Supply to oversee,and one, moreover, which did not bulk very large until war had broken out.Bulk Storage of Gas.3. It was decided at an interdepartmental meeting held on the28th November, 1938, that the bulk storage of gas should be given protection against the 500-lb. S.A.P. bomb. This meant something more than a straight-forward engineering proposition and ended in the drawing up of a very elaboratespecification of ideal requirements. There followed a prolonged search to finda site which would meet these requirements; and as a result work on driving thetunnels was not started until October 1939.4. It has been represented to me that the bulk storage of gas is a difficultoperation, of which there had been little experience, and that exaggerated views were taken as to the dangers of gas and the need for secrecy. Nevertheless, nopressure seems to have been applied to hold the balance between the evolution of an absolutely satisfactory scheme and the completion of the work within areasonable period.[21929]
Manufacture of Projectiles.5. Here, too, there seems to have been a failure to apply driving force toexperts. The War Office are to-day in a very unsatisfactory position. Untilquite recently they had no projectiles except Livens drums and a certain numberof shells for obsolete 6-inch Howitzers derived from 1914-18 stocks. It is truethat there have been great difficulties in designing a suitable gas shell for thenew 25-pdr. Further, there has been an acute shortage of HE. shells for the25-pdr., and the provision of gas shell for this gun formed part of the largerproblem of ammunition for the new field gun-. But it is unsatisfactory that asystem for the production of 25-pdr. gas shell was not cleared for productionuntil the autumn of 1939, and that only about 1,300 of these shells should havebeen produced and filled to date.6. The R.A.F. reserve of gas bombs is fairly satisfactory. But having, inApril 1938, decided that the containers for gas-spraying should be brought back for re-charging and not jettisoned after use, the Air Ministry, in September 1939,reversed this decision and recommended that the containers should be jettisoned.The controversy about these two methods lasted for four months; first between different branches of the Air Ministry, and then between the Air Ministry andthe Treasury.   Finally, it was decided to jettison the containers.Conclusion.7. These instances illustrate an all-too-frequent tendency to substituteenquiry for action. Committees are set up, formed of persons with expertknowledge of particular aspects of the subject, or representing a particular pointof view. Long discussions follow, and the sum total represents a counsel ofperfection. The Committee, from being a servant, becomes the master, and action is paralysed. There is no one person who insists upon a workable solution beingquickly found and action driven forward to a conclusion.8. Again, in recent years many of the changes in the organisation of departments have had the effect of sub-dividing responsibility in such a way that it is difficult for any one person below the Minister to exercise any realcontrol. Responsibility is diffused between a number of different sections. Whatis required is a re-integration of the elements of Departmental organisation intounits corresponding with the main Departmental functions; each unit being placed under an Officer who would be able, and would be expected, to exercise a real measure of responsibility under Ministers, for the matters dealt with.(Initialled) C.
