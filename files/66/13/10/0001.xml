Subversive propaganda in the "Daily Mirror" and "Sunday Pictorial".

Memorandum by the Home Secretary.

In accordance with the conslusion reached at the War Cabinet on the 9th October (W.M.(40) 268th Conclusions item 10) enquiry has now been made by the police as to the identity of the holders of large blocks of shares in the "Daily Mirror" and the "Sunday Pictorial" and the information obtained indicates that there is no individual or group of individuals controlling the policy of these papers by means of a preponderating financial interest.

The authorised share capital of the "Daily Mirror" consists of 5,650,000 ordinary shares of 5/- and 800,000 8 per cent cumulative preference shares of £1. Attached is a list of every person or company holding 15,000 ordinary shares or more in the "Daily Mirror". Amongst the principal holders of ordinary shares in the "Daily Mirror" are Drummonds Branch Nominees Limited, C.O. Nominees Limited, and Midland Bank Executors and Trustee Company Limited. Drummonds Branch Nominees Limited hold for the "Sunday Pictorial", and the other two companies hold for a number of investment trusts.

Of the preference shares, the principal holders are the Refuge Assurance Company; the Prudential Assurance Company; and the London Office Royal Bank of Scotland Nominees Limited, which holds for the Alliance Trust and the Second Alliance Trust Companies of Dundee and the Scottish Amalgamated Investment Company of Edinburgh. The articles of Association provide that preference shareholdings shall not except in certain specified circumstances confer the right to vote at general meetings.

Debentures for the "Daily Mirror" have been created for a total of £2,200,000 and all these are held by the Law Debenture Corporation, an investment company of which the Directors include Sir Miles Walker Mattinson and Lord Greenwood.

The "Sunday Pictorial" has a capital of 1,050,000 ordinary shares of £1 and 500,000 preference shares of £1. The principal shareholders of the ordinary shares are:-

Daily Mirror Newspapers Limited 245,000 shares.

Midland Bank Executor and Trustee Company 26,500 shares

W.D. Roome 21,236 shares

Alfred Bell 10,000 shares

The Midland Bank Executor and Trustee Company holds for investment trusts.

As regards the investment trusts which hold a considerable number of the shares of these two newspapers, the officials of the
principal banks&apos; who,,have been, consulted say that oompletre &quot;con-fianceis felt in .&apos;5he&quot; Integrity &apos;of&quot;the.&quot;Direotdr^s&apos;ahd Managers Qf these companies, and there seems no: doubt that these trust companies are interested in the papers merely from an&apos;investment., point; ofview, &apos;        .;     .;.;/;:-. &apos;     &apos; &apos;..       % &apos;.The Mr. Wallace D. Roome, who holds- 43,176&apos;:. 0-Usres in the&quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and 21,236 shares in the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;has been associated with the newspaper trade for many years.He is4 sold to have been one of &quot;the right-hand men of LordNorthe1iffe in.the days when the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; formed one of W,the Northcliffe Group.     He takes an active part in themanagement pf hpth the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;,but .It is reported that he Is primarily concerned with- exeoutiye -matters.;:, that he is not specifically concerned with policy, -   ,&apos; ],,and that the ..ma;jor influence: over policy is Exercised by-Mre John O&apos;owiey? the Managing /Director of both papers,The Special Branch Inspector who conducted the&apos; enquiry &apos;,.says that he . &quot;canvassed,the opinion of certain persons holding-prominent positions in the- newspaper world&quot; and that theirunanimous-opinion is &quot;that -there; is no: secret control or setpolitical -policy;    that the overriding factor in deciding-&apos;policy is the circulation figure;:,   that the paper has built up .its circulation by. its sensational write-up&apos;of currentcontroversial subjects and -&quot;by -the space given &quot;by it to :;  &apos;: *;photographs, arid articles exploiting &quot;aex-appeal&quot;.     It sets ^ut,-to establish a reputation for pungency and .virility for itsfeature writers, whose views it iQeekS to establish as those ofthe younger generation 6f&quot;progressive political thinkers&quot;.The 3inspector. in ;his report calls attention to an article -written some two years ago&quot; in the &quot;Daily Telegraph^ under, the :Signature of;lord Oomroae; in,which, the;following passageappears ; - :. - ,      ;  , , //&apos;...-./.. ;&apos;.:/,.., ...    .&apos;/;-;,-&quot;*&quot;--      / &quot;The Daily -Mirror&quot;&apos;and.!.&apos;Sunday-Pictorial&quot; were&quot;formerly controlled by Lord Rothermere, who in.-,.. , these&apos; days; owned a : large number, of -the . shores,and his nephew, Mr * Cecil Harmsworth Kingy. is. ,&apos;\&quot;- ;&apos;- - still a director of the companies.     Lord-Rothermere&apos;publicly announced in.March, 1931,&quot;   .that he had entirely severed his -connection withthe companies and:no longer owned- any shares in&apos;/;either of them, .i.     - &apos;&quot;&quot;   / &quot;.....* .. There has , be en much cur iosit-y expressed . in regardto the ownership of these papers- of recent years.The fact is that, as a result of sales on the&apos;  . market of Lord Rothermere &apos;s holdings and other large owners, the shares of both companies are,  so widely distributed/among -the public that there&quot;-&apos; - . is no control in any possible combination of largeholders&quot;.The- Inspector making the investigation also obtained&apos;   -confidential information.from the Special Commissioners of        f\- Tnland Revenue, who have the duty of analysing the share- -        V/holdings of companies in order to determine, primarily-for thepurpose of-national defence contributions, whether the Directorsor any group of shareholders have a controlling interest orwhether a company is a subsidiary of some other company.     he says that the definite conclusion of the Special Commissionersis 1&apos;that no such control exists in the, case of the &quot;Daily Mirrerand that the company is not subsidiary to any other concern.-&quot;HOME OFFICE&quot;2nd November, 1940,
