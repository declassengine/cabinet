Irrrpli eat ions.    Our naval position in the eastern mediterranean would &quot;be weakened &quot;by an Italianoccupation of Greece, but on the other hand $Italian aggression in Greece would give us anopportunity of securing a valuable pris-s in Creteand a naval and air base,.,Phase 2.&apos;    Advance into Turkish Thrace and establishmentof bridgeheads on the Basteru side of the Straits.Even assuming Turkish re sir canoe,  this might becompleted by the end of 1&apos; -40..Implications.&apos;     If Turkey could maintain her p ositionon the Asiatic shore of the Straits,  the enemy&apos;would gain no economic advantage0      Similarly he would nothave further improv,d his general strategicsituation very greatly.     For these reasons itwould seem wise  &apos;:aat the Turks should not attemptto fight decisively in Thrace where they are likelyto be overrun but should concentrate their maineffort on defending their Asiatic shores of theStraits.&apos;Phase 5.&apos; Consolidation in Anatolia and advance intoSyria and possibly into Northern Iraq to be carriedout in the spring and early summer of 1941.Further Axis Moves,      Subsequent advance eithersouthwards into Palestine and Egypt or eastwardsinto Iraq,Implications.Land forces advancing through Syria would constitute a vital threat to car hold on Egypt in thatThey would cut our alternative line ofcomrnunication to Egypt via Iraq and palestine.Our limited forces in Egypt vioald be forcedto fight on two frontsThe threat of the increased scale of air attack from Anatolia,  Syria or palestine would seriously affect the security of our whole position in the Middle East and, inparticular, the security of the fleet at alexandria pour oil supplies fromlr-aq and Iran-would alsobe threatened by air attacksAs long as we can operate the fleet in the- eastern mediterranean, the enemy&apos;s advance through Anatoliawould not greatly iapa X our economic blockade.     he might be able to draw limited supplies of oil and other raw materials from fc&amp;led a*rvlre^fiswe the;-de struct ion of the oil fields-;, pipe l-inev-r and &quot;railways.(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)

Conclusion.&apos;4. ..,    From the above it will he seem that effectiveTurkish resistance is the main bar to German, progress to tftfe Sbuth EastwardoRecOmmendationso5.        Turkey.     Everything possible should be done tostrengthen the Turkish will, and ability to resist Axispressure.   We recommend the following measures? some ofwhich are already in hand-, as a matter of urgency.Direct Assistance0(a) A plan is now beinjt- discussed by Major-General Smith with the lurks at Ankara for direct assistance by British forces to meetan immediate threat to Turkey.   We await hisreporto(b) Direct assistance at a later date e.g. the spring, is also being discussed by Major-General Smitho    In the meanwhile we haVeinstituted an enquiry by the Joint planning staff as to the forces which.:-would be necessaryfor us to despatch to Turkey, if the Italianthreat- to Egypt proves to be a holding attackonly, and the main Axis thrust is directed against TurkeyoArmaments.(c) Our supplies of armaments to Turkey have recentlydwindled to very small proportions.   an examination is now being made with a view to increasing supplies.A Mission.(d) We should form a Mission to Turkey and establishit in the Middle East as soon as possible? sothat it may be ready to move to Turkey at once,in the event of the Turks becoming involve dirt,the War0If the Turks are willing tct accept the Missionnow so much the better.   We recommend that our ambassador at Ankara should sound the Turks onthis pc^nt,Dqrnolition,..(e)   Demolition plans should be prepared for theTurkish communications in Anatolia, particularly the port and transit facilities across theStraits and the Sea of Marmara, and the tunnels-through the Taurus Mountains.6*      -Russia.    The attitude of Russia is of the first importance.    It is necessary to prevent Russia definitelyaligning herself a gel y;cus in the Near or. Middle East.This consideration should take first place in all ourdealings with the Soviet Government, subject only to the over-ruling need of keeping our policy in this respectuniform with that of the United Stat.g*p.

W 9/. Turkey could hardly afford to resist german aggression unless she felt secure against Russian attack in the Caucasus.      We should   foster the idea of a neutralRussia in the event of Turkey being attacked, but themeans of achieving this must be political rather than military.8. In addition, we should seize the opportunity ofthe inter-change of visits by Air Attaches to impress Russia with the potentialities of our air strength.9&apos; Syria.      The French authorities in Syria should be prevented from taking action hostile to our interests.We recommend(a) Economic and financial pressure to showthat Syria is dependent on our goodwill.(b) The placing of no obstacles in the way of theim-Miedia te removal to France of the dis-contented reservists who have anti-Britishsympathies.(c) The continued refusal of permission fortils transfer of French North African Trooosto Syria.(d) Assistance and eric our a gem en t to the Anti-. Vichy faction in Syria in the hope of anearly coup d&apos;etat.(e) Thet the plans which we propose to concert with the Turks (see para. 5 above), should include plans for occupying Syria andseizing the communications if need arises..10.        Irao;.      The situation in Iraq requires the firmesthandling, and the effect of firmness will react not onlyon Turkey but also on Syria,      In the absence of forcesimmediately available for despatch to Iraq, themeasures recommended are:-,       (a)    The removal of Rashid All Gailani and thesubstitution of a more helpful PrimeMinister.-\(b)    The elimination&apos;of the ..ufti.     There right ample evidence that he is in enemy pay.The Mufti * s removal is unlikely to haveill effects, since it is strength notweakness which is admired in the arab world.(c) Financial and economic aid.(d) A special diplomatic mission beaded by astrong pars naility known to and respectedby the Arabs to go to Baghdad.&apos;    this mission should be able to make offers under(c) above in order te secure our require-laents under (a) and (b) .

(e)    Though no large forces are at present available for Iraq it might be useful to open the desert route as a line of communications in order to show that we intend to exercise our rights under thetreaty and that we are not afraid ofIraqi reactions or of the pro-axissympathies of the Iraqi Government.11.       Oil.     Plans already in preparation for thedestruction of the Iraqi oil wells and the pipe lines inIraq, Syria and Palestine should be perfected and broughtto a state in which they could be operated withoutintereference at very short notice.     It is important tokeep these plans secret from the Iraqi Government.12.       As will be seen from paragraphs ^-Xl the weakness of our forces in the Middle East places seriouslimitations on our ability to ensure Turkish resistanceand a proper   attitude on the part of the other countriesaffected.     We are, therefore, fully in agreement with thedecision.that we should utilise to the full our shipping resources to reinforce our land and air forces in theMiddle East.     It is desirable that by the Spring we shouldhave forces available in the Middle East for:- .(a) Direct, assistance to Turkey.(b) The occupation of Syria in conjunction withthe Turks.(c) The occupation of Iraq.15.        Tt is unlikely that any considerable force. wii-ibe available for these purposes before the Spring of1941.   A vigorous diplomatic and economic offensiveshould, nevertheless, start at once, making-, use of allweapons available including threats and money.,  (Sig: ned)   DUDLEY POUND.11 J.(8.
