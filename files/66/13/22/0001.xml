THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECRET.W.P. (40) MZ.November 13, 1940.Copy No.    28TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this documentIIIWAR CABINET.RELATIONS WITH FRANCE AND SPAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, the following-extract from a letter of the 8th November from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in madrid on our relations with France and the economic position in Spain.H.Foreign Office, November 13, 1940.I am still more worried about the French position than I am about theSpanish. I feel sure that the Germans are trying to embroil our two fleets. Itseems to me that the French Fleet would be an indirect asset to Germany ofimmense importance and that we ought to do our utmost to avoid playing the obvious German game. De La Baume&apos;s departure is a great loss to me here ashe was 100 per cent, with us. Several times he gave me advice that seemed tome to be extremely wise and friendly. Pietri, on the other hand, is obviously apolitical light-weight and I should imagine one of Laval&apos;s instruments. Itelegraphed to you the account of my first interview with him and I will onlyadd to what I then said, that he seemed greatly impressed by the strength ofthe German machine. He also told me that Baudouin still had considerable influence with Petain. I am sure from what De La Baume has told me thatBaudouin, although he is a time-server, is definitely on the anti-Laval side. Asto Weygand, I have had from the French delegate who has been doing the Morocconegotiations an account of the General&apos;s last interview with Laval. Weygandseems to have told Laval what he thought of him and his policy and the twocould not have parted in an atmosphere of greater mutual hostility. this account, that comes direct from someone who has seen Weygand in recent days,(-confirms the view that I have constantly expressed to you about futurepossibilities.My other constant worry is the economic position here. It gets worse andworse, and if there is a further delay with American help it will be beyondcontrol. What will then happen ? I had once thought that bread riots wouldmean the end of Suner and the Falange. I have now come definitely to the viewthat this is not what will happen. Suner and his friends will use the crisis fora terrific attack upon us and for a pretext to allow the Germans in. The germans would come in not as invaders after an ultimatum, but as friends to organisehelp, economic and otherwise, for Spain. Suner and his friends having once gotcontrol of the machine of government are not going to let it go. If we help themto avoid famine they will play with us up to a point. If we do not help them,they will fall back upon German military help to keep themselves in power.I should be glad if you would put this view to Winston and the War Cabinet.I am sure that it is sound. We are dealing with men whose careers and evenlives are at stake.  Whatever happens, they will try to hold onto their jobs.SAMUEL HOARE.11210   [21915]
