Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECRET.W.P. (40) 437.November 12, 1940TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.RELATIONS WITH VICHY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, a minute bySir Ronald Campbell covering a record of his conversations with the formerPolish Charge d&apos;Affaires at Vichy.H.Foreign Office, November 12, 1940.THE annexed note is the record of two conversations which I have had withM. Frankowski, who was Polish Charge d&apos;Affaires at Vichy until early lastmonth, when the French said they must reluctantly ask him to leave as theGermans had insisted on it.I agree generally with M. Frankowski&apos;s diagnosis of the state of mindprevailing among the Vichy politicians.The most important, to my mind, of the recommendations which he makes isthat relating to the need for establishing unofficial contacts with Vichy.M. Palewski also makes this point, and contends that we shall never get anywhereby making collective approaches to the Vichy Government as a whole. We mustget at them individually. I feel convinced this is right, and that it may, indeed,be the only way to avoid drifting into war.I am the last person to feel any tenderness towards the Vichy Government.If I had my way I would like to tell in very plain language what I think ofthem. But it is a case of &quot; needs must when the devil drives.&quot; We have nomeans whatever of getting rid of the present gang; and any change can onlybe for the worse.I am sure the right policy is to try gradually to lead them along. Theywill be shy and timid at first, but if we can persuade them individually that wehave no personal animus against them, and as our prospects of destroying the nazi regime improve, there is at least a chance that they may come round. Butit is a race against time, as German pressure will doubtless be appliedprogressively.The Vichy Government are between the devil and the deep sea. There are indications that they are not, taken as a whole, so hostile to us as they have topretend to be. Part of their hostility is due to their belief that we are hostile to them.   We should try to persuade them that we realise their difficulties, just11209   [21906]Copy No.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT
as we expect them to realise ours. If we can do this we may get to a position where we can discuss things (very secretly) with a measure at least of mutual understanding.Unless we can reach that stage without much delay, we may quickly driftinto a virtual state of war.E. II. CAMPBELL.November 6, 1940.I have had a further talk with M. Frankowski, who left Vichy early inOctober. He is a Minister Plenipotentiary in the Polish Diplomatic service andacted as Charge d&apos;Affaires in Paris after the disappearance of the ambassador at an early stage of the war. He had been for many years in the Polish embassy in Paris. He knows France and French personalities well, and is a very shrewdobserver.   His own Government have a high opinion of him.The following are the main points which he made, either spontaneously orby way of reply to questions which I put to him : -State of mind of Vichy. The Bordeaux Government were convinced thatwith France beaten it was only a matter of weeks before Great Britain would beoverwhelmed. They therefore rushed into a premature capitulation, in circum-stances amounting to betrayal of their ally, in the hope by so doing of obtainingmore lenient terms, rather than hang on and run the risk of Great Britain, assoon as she realised the game was up, negotiating a hurried peace at the expenseof France. This, broadly, was the attitude of the politicians, though there were also other, less base, but equally misguided, motives in the minds of Petain andWeygand.An early British defeat would have enabled those responsible for thecapitulation to justify their act vis-a-vis the French people. Every British successbrings nearer the day when they may come to be regarded as traitors. (this applies not only to the members of the Bordeaux Government, but to all thosecivilian officials, military officers, and others, who accepted the capitulation bythe mere fact of carrying out the orders they were given.)All these people, though impressed with our powers of resistance, are notyet convinced of an ultimate British victory. Some are beginning to look to itas the only hope of salvation. Others the opportunists- are beginning to feel the need of trimming their sails to the incipient breeze now blowing from acrossthe Channel. Others, again, such as M. Laval, claim that, even if GreatBritain continues to survive, she will never be able, and may not even seek, to destroy her enemy, with the result that Germany will remain the dominant power on the continent of Europe.Meanwhile, in order to justify the capitulation and their continued raisond&apos;etre, the Vichy Government must produce results, in the way of easing the lot of the people.   They are meeting with very scant success.The result of all this is that the men of Vichy are completely disillusioned.They have lost faith in everything and everybody, including themselves. Theyare consumed with heart-searching and indecision.They should therefore be treated not as a gang of traitors (though no doubt the cap fits some of them), but rather as sick men reduced by illness to an abnormalstate of mind. Allowances should be made for the difficulties of their position,which are very great.The French people are in much the same case. In their bewilderment they still keep their faith in the aged Marshal as a man of honour and one who will do his best to alleviate their lot. They even tolerate (though disliking) Lavalbecause they think his German proclivities and powers of persuasion will enable him to &apos;&apos; wangle &apos;&apos; little concessions. But not being exposed, as the politiciansare, to the risk of coming to be regarded as traitors, the people, generallyspeaking, have been quicker to react to the resistance put up by Great Britain.Petain&apos;s position. M. Frankowski thinks that Petain is still the master.He does not like Laval, and constantly does things without consulting him. ButLaval is useful both because he is the only man with any real force of character and because he is more likely than any other to get on with the Germans.Although Petain knows he must pay a price for every concession, there is a limit
beyond which he is not likely to go. Laval, no doubt, would be ready to go con-siderably further than Petain, but so long as the Marshal is in command, as he still is, M. Frankowski does not think the Vichy Government will either handover large portions of the French Empire or deliver the French fleet into enemyhands. He doubts whether even Laval would dare do this. He is hardly the manto burn his boats by taking so far-reaching a decision before knowing exactlywhere it will lead him.   He is essentially an opportunist and a trimmer.Attitude to Italy. M. Frankowski asserts (I am sure he is right) that theFrench, who were not beaten in arms by Italy, still retain their old dislike andcontempt of the Italians, and are much more likely to resist Italian than theyare German demands. This, he says, applies even to Laval, notwithstanding hisformer Italian leanings.Conditions at Vichy. M. Frankowski says that Vichy is almost completelycut off from the outer world, and consequently very badly informed. Few, if any,foreign newspapers and no English or American ones ever get through. although they are presumably receiving news of a sort from their diplomatic represenfa-tives, even Government circles are incredibly ignorant of what is going onoutside, and even to a large extent inside, France.Recommendations. M. Frankowski recommends (1) That we should rigidly abstain from abuse of, or even slighting references to, the Vichy Government, all of whose members are covered byPetain&apos;s prestige. He is inclined to include even Laval in thisrecommendation, both because he has been nominated by Petain ashis successor, and because it can only offend the old Marshal, who,though not liking Laval, finds him useful. Moreover, there is nopoint in making Laval more bitter against us than he already is. Noamount of abuse will lead to the removal of the Vichy Government,or any one of its members, since the French people have no say inthe matter. The continuance in office, or otherwise, of any FrenchGovernment is for the present, and is likely for some time to remain,solely in German hands. Any change in these circumstances couldonly be for the worse;(2) That we should establish contacts with Vichy through one or more care-fully selected unofficial agents who could go there inconspicuously on some plausible pretext or other. He suggests that a trustworthyjournalist might be the kind of man to send; or somebody who hasprivate business to liquidate.(3) That we should try, as far as possible, to lessen the breach between Vichyand General de Gaulle, or at least abstain from throwing it intorelief. His ideas on this point were rather hazy. He admitted thatwe could not throw over de Gaulle and would be&quot; wrong to do so, buthe thought that continued support of him need not necessarily debarus from establishing a closer link with Vichy than we have at present.(4) That we should try to suborn one or two French journalists. They must. be in low water now and would doubtless be ready, if well paid, to goas far as possible in writing the right kind of stuff.(5) That we should make some gesture in the matter of the blockade. it need only be on a very small scale in fact no more than symbolical.I think this pretty well covers the ground. The point on which m. Frankowski was most insistent was the need to establish unofficial contacts with French politicians, with the object, first, of enlightening them about thingsof which they are unbelievably ignorant; and, secondly, of encouraging themgradually to show a stiff er resistance to German pressure.I think M. Frankowski is right. Our agents who would need to be very carefully chosen and coached, should not attempt to get into touch at once with french politicians direct, but through some mutual friend in the first instance.They should begin by giving news, particularly in regard to all the factors whichare working slowly but steadily in our favour; they should emphasise our determination to pursue the war until we have destroyed the Nazi system; theyshould expatiate on the &quot; new order &quot; which we shall hope (with French help) toset up in Europe, contrasted with the &quot; new order &quot; which Germany would set
up if she were victorious; they should convey the idea that we shall have nowish to impose any particular system of government in France or support anyparticular party in preference to any other, and that we are, and shall remain,ready to work with any Government that is ready to work with us; last, but not least, they should subtly convey that we have no animus against any member ofthe present Government; it is largely because many of them feel that they havemade a lasting enemy of us that they are casting the bread upon the Germanwaters.R.
