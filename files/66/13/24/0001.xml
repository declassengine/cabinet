(40) 444. //November 15, 1940. \JTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PROPAGANDA POLICY.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Information and the Minister of economic warfare.THE accompanying paper has been drawn up in close consultation and complete agreement with the Chiefs of Staff, whose views are given in the notebelow. We are very glad to record this agreement, and we look forward toregular consultations with the Chiefs of Staff in the future, in order to ensurethat political and military warfare are constantly co-ordinated. The paper is submitted to the War Cabinet in order that approval may be obtained for theprinciples of propaganda laid down.(Initialled) D. C.H. D.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1, &apos;November 15, 1940.Note by the Chiefs of Staff.WE are in cordial agreement with the principles and aims set out in theattached Memorandum on Propaganda Policy as far as they relate, as they do to a considerable extent, to our military strategy.2. In addition to long-term propaganda, we think it important that ourday-to-day propaganda and publicity machine should be ready to reactimmediately to events, and, if possible, to exploit them. The kind of events wehave in mind are the invasion of Norway, the collapse of France and the entry of Italy into the war. Although disadvantageous to us from the military pointof view, it might have been possible to make much capital out of the above events in the propaganda field if we had been fully ready to exploit them at once either by careful anticipation or by prompt action when they occurred.3. Moreover, it should be clear from the start what line our propaganda and publicity is to take at present there is a liability to hesitancy and uncertainty in the way in which the Press reacts to these events.4, As a result of our discussion with the Ministers of Information andEconomic Warfare, we have already instituted certain measures which should enable our liaison officers with the Press and the B.B.C. to be more fully informed of our views when drastic changes in the strategic situation occur. We are ready, on our part, to co-operate to the fullest extent to achieve accord with theDepartments concerned in the development of our Propaganda Policy.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.J. G. DILL.C. F. A. PORTAL.[21923]
PROPAGANDA   POLICY.THE purpose of this appreciation which we have drawn up in collaborationis to define the lines on which British propaganda should be conducted. As hasalready been pointed out in the Chiefs of Staff appreciation of future strategy,propaganda must play an important part in our methods of defeating Germany.It is, in fact, an essential element in the strategy of total warfare.Aims of British Propaganda.2.   Propaganda as an arm in war has two main functions  To wage psychological warfare (a) with the simultaneous object of destroying the moral force of the enemy&apos;scause and of sustaining and eventually enforcing conviction of the moral force of our own cause;(b) by co-operating with the other arms to prepare the way for and to exploit the effects of the military and economic offensive.3. These functions are complementary; and underlying both must be thecommon aim of weakening the resistance of our enemies and of maintaining the morale of our own people and the confidence of our friends. In both, counter-propaganda must play an important part.4. In the succeeding paragraph we summarise our main conclusions, forwhich we ask the approval of the War Cabinet. In doing so, we wish to stress the urgency of tackling this problem of our propaganda policy, and of placingit on an established basis.Conclusions.5. We recommend that our propaganda policy should be governed by thefollowing principles : (a) Our propaganda should be planned with due regard to the possibilitiesof the strategical situation. Machinery already exists forco-ordinating our propaganda and strategy by means of contacts between the Chiefs of Staff or their representatives on the one side and the Minister of Economic Warfare and the Minister ofInformation or their representatives on the other.   .(b) The news published in our open propaganda should be true and accurate.Unpleasant facts should not be hidden merely because they areunwelcome.(c) Whatever the strategical situation, our propaganda should not becomedefensive. While we should guard against inspiring over-confidence,we should capitalise to the utmost all the factors in our favour, andshould exploit any visible military successes, however small.(d) While it is too early as yet to formulate in any detail a propagandaplan in direct relation to next year&apos;s campaigns, the elimination ofItaly as a means to the defeat of Germany comes first among our strategic aims, and a propaganda plan to promote it would naturallyemerge from the discussions referred to in paragraph 5 (a).(e) The maintenance of public morale in this country, and the underminingof morale among our enemies and their forces in the occupied countries,will be of supreme importance during the coming months of strain.It should be the particular aim of our propaganda during the presentwinter to preserve the moral force of our own cause and to destroy the false moral foundations of our enemies.(/). Although essentially we are fighting for our very existence, this factoralone is not fully adequate to the psychological needs of our own people and means nothing to our enemies. A more positive conceptionis required. From the point of view of our propaganda, there is a real need for a formulation of post-war aims in broad terms whichwill sustain the spiritual motive force of our own people, appeal toour supporters abroad (especially America) and counter the Germanconception of a new order.
(g) To be effective, propaganda should be supported by action.   While wefully recognise the practical difficulties, it would be of immense value in our propaganda if besides being able to proclaim our ideals forthe future we could point to positive evidence of a programme of social and economic reconstruction already in progress in this country.(h) At the same time, we should exploit the achievements already made inin the past in the field of social reconstruction and Imperial organi-sation, which should be driven home by comparison between conditionsin the democratic countries and the totalitarian States.(i) Without committing ourselves in any way to a policy of reprisals, weshould stress our growing ability to meet terror with terror and tomete out retribution to our enemies at our own selected time.(j) As an essential corollary to &apos;&apos; fear &apos;&apos; propaganda, we should hold out thehope of a &quot; fair deal &quot; to our enemies in a British peace. In thisconnection, we should stress the ability and intention of the UnitedStates and ourselves to relieve conditions in Europe immediately thewar is over. Such propaganda would be reinforced if we couldactually purchase and set aside stocks of food in the american continent for future European relief.(k) Incitement to revolts in Europe against the Axis Powers is one of the positive objects of our propaganda subject to the proviso that no attempt should be made to incite revolts prematurely.(I) We should try to sow mistrust between Germany, Italy and Japan, andshould hammer in the theme that the origin of the war lies in german aggression and that the sufferings of all peoples are directly due tothis.(m) Our counter-propaganda should continually exploit the lies and incbn-sistencies of German propaganda.(n) It is the duty of the Services to ensure the prompt release of &quot; hot &quot;news and to afford all possible facilities for publicity, as well as to suppress information which might compromise security. There mustbe constant co-operation between the service staffs and the propaganda and press authorities, with the object of conducting a planned pro-paganda campaign in line with military policy and operations. Tothis end it will be necessary to perfect our machinery for day-to-daypropaganda and publicity to meet current events.(o) Finally, the question of the closer co-ordination of broadcasting by theB.B.C. with Government policy during the war should be considered,in order to ensure that no matter is broadcast by the B.B.C. which inany way conflicts with the wishes of the Government Departmentsconcerned.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,November 15, 1940.
