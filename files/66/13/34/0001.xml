THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 454.November 21, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR GABINET.COASTAL COMMAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN accordance with the Conclusions of the Meeting of the DefenceCommittee held on the 5th November the Prime Minister has circulated a listof points which he wished studied in connexion with a proposal that coastal command should be transferred to the Royal Navy. I set out below mybbservations both on the Prime Minister&apos;s points and on Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s paper (W.P. (40) 439) on the same subject.A.  What complaints have the Admiralty against the present system?So far as I am aware, the only complaint of the Admiralty against coastal command is that it is not big enough.Over the past year the operational strength of the squadrons operating under Coastal Command has increased by nearly 100 per cent. This rate of expansion exceeds that of the Air Force as a whole and contrasts sharply withthe rate of progress of Bomber Command.So much for the past. The vital problem of the moment is to get everyavailable aircraft into the air for the defence of trade. We have held two meetings with the Naval staff on this and I think the Admiralty are satisfiedthat the further increase we are now making (some 4\ squadrons) represents the maximum that can be done at the moment, having regard to the other commitments of the Metropolitan Air Force, the most important of which at thepresent time is the strengthening of Bomber Command. To effect this increasewe shall have to pool resources with the Admiralty in aircraft, aerodromes and personnel. This is being done. We shall review the matter weekly in order tomake a start with further new units the moment our resources allow.B. (1) What operational advantages would there be over the present system?None. To transfer Coastal Command to the Royal Navy would neitheradd to the resources available for trade defence nor concentrate under a singleauthority responsibility for that commitment. The Navy would still rely uponFighter Command for defence of its Fleet bases and for the protection of coast-wise shipping, and upon Bomber Command for its main striking force. Onlyco-operation can solve the problem of meeting widely varying commitments witha limited force.[21938]
B. (2) Would the various stages in the training of pilots and aircraft best be managed in Royal Naval or in Royal Air Force training establishments&apos;1.Up to the end of the S.F.T.S. course, basic flying training is essentially thesame for Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm pilots, though it is true that theground instruction for Fleet Air Arm pilots is modified to accord with Navalrequirements, and there are differences in the length of the respective courses.Training of pilots must, in the interests of economy of effort, be centralisedas far as possible, up to the stage at which specialisation becomes necessary.This principle has been amply justified in the past six months. At a time of greatshortage of pilots it was possible for the Fleet Air Arm to lend to the MetropolitanAir Force pilots who could promptly take their ,place with Royal Air Force squadrons fighting in the line. The existence of common training standards hasalso made it possible to utilise spare capacity at the schools at which naval pilotsare trained in order to augment the flow of pilots to the Royal Air Force.Thus the principle, of common basic training has produced the economy andflexibility for which it was designed, and it has served us well at a critical time.It may well happen in the future that a situation will arise in which the need of pilots for the Fleet Air Arm is intensified and the flexibility which has helped the R.A.F. in the past months may prove equally beneficial to the Fleet Air Arm.B. (3) What would be the effect of the change on the provision of men and aircraft %   Would there be any net increase of resources^.There would be no net increase of resources. The Admiralty and Air ministry have already pooled their resources in order to get the maximum number of aircraft in the air for trade defence.It has been suggested that a decision to establish a separate Air Force forthe Royal Navy would open up new resources in pilots. It is assumed that thereis no surplus of men suitable for training as pilots already serving in the Navy.In fact, therefore, the Navy would tap exactly the same flow of candidates asthat upon which the Royal Air Force now draws. A decision to split the RoyalAir Force would merely divide this flow and divert it to self-contained Naval andR.A.F. training establishments a clearly uneconomical procedure.The supply of aircraft has to meet all requirements. There are no concealedresources which a transfer of Coastal Command to the Navy would bring into play. The question is simply one of priorities, and I believe the latest decisions regarding the increase to be made in Coastal Command are accepted by theAdmiralty as satisfactory in the light of all the other commitments involved.B. (4) How would an increase of &quot; overheads &quot; and an overlapping of functions between the R.A .F. and the F.A .A. be avoided 1An increase of &quot; overheads &quot; and an overlapping of function would be unavoidable. It was indeed mainly to avoid such duplication that a unified AirForce was brought into being.B. (5) How could an undue diversion of resources to defensive duties owing tothe desire of the Fleet Air Arm to ensure its requirements being met onan over-genercnis scale be best avoided^There would be a natural tendency for the Navy to build up an Air Forceadequate for its peak requirements.   In consequence, an undue proportion of effort would be diverted from the main task of winning the air war againstGermany.Even so, it would be impossible for the Naval Air Command to be self-sufficient. It would still rely on Fighter Command for the defence of Fleet bases and in-shore convoys, and upon the Metropolitan Bomber Force for a StrikingArm. Co-operation on much the same lines as exist at the moment would stillbe indispensable with the distinction that the air effort as a whole would be rendered less flexible and therefore less effective.No one would suggest that the needs of the Navy for air protection and indeed the corresponding needs of the Army can be considered in isolation and/-hat when these needs have been met, whatever remains will suffice for the RoyalAir Force. We are at present faced with a grave inferiority in air strengthvis-a-vis Germany.   Unless we can overcome this weakness and win our way to
general air superiority, our freedom of action will be gravely impaired and none of the other efforts we are making will avail. It is, therefore, vital that we shouldallot the minimum proportion of our resources to the strictly defensive roles.C. // the suggested transfer were not carried out, what improvements couldbe made, toithin the framework of the present organisation, to increasethe resources available to Coastal Command, and to bring the co-opera-tion between the latter and the Royal Navy to the highest pitch, of efficiency?The question of increasing the resources of Coastal Command is dealt with under A above.The arrangements for co-operation between Coastal Command and the royal navy are based on a careful study undertaken by the Naval and Air Staffs beforethe war. They have been developed as the result of war experience and representa remarkable piece of team work and of inter-service co-operation.So far as I am aware, neither the efficiency of Coastal Command nor themachinery under which it works in co-operation with the Royal Navy have been called in question. The difficulty is merely one of numbers, and on this it mustbe remembered that the requirements of the Coastal Command underwent a vastand unexpected increase when the coasts of Norway and Northern France fellinto German hands. The added strain on Fighter Command from these new commitments was, if possible, of even greater consequence, and priority had tobe given to this Command to prevent our defences being overwhelmed by theGerman Bomber Force.Apart from the question of numbers, I am not aware of any outstandingproposals for increasing the help which Coastal Command are giving to theRoyal Navy. Whenever the Admiralty make suggestions they will be received in a helpful and constructive spirit.Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s Paper.The principal points in Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s paper are that Coastal Commandhas failed to meet the needs of the Royal Navy, that it is inadequate, that there isno increasing flow of pilots on a large scale, and that special qualifications arerequired for work in co-operation with the Royal Navy that can only be expected of a Naval Air Pilot.The last of Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s points is adequately met by the fact that,so far as I am aware, no complaint has been made against the efficiency with whichCoastal Command has carried out its highly important task. Special training for Coastal Command pilots is, of course, required, and is given, according to function, in the School of General Reconnaissance, the Flying Boat operational training Unit or in the Torpedo Training Unit.The adequacy of Coastal Command in point of numbers is a separate matter which is fully discussed in earlier parts of the present memorandum.There has been an increasing flow of pilots to Coastal Command, and a deficiency in strength of more than 100 in June has been turned into a surplus of nearly 100 at the beginning of November, which enables us to start forming newsquadrons. The planned output of Coastal Operational Training Units providesfor an output of 95 pilots per month in the future, which may be compared witha monthly average of 33 pilot casualties (including wounded and injured) over thelast six months.Similarly, with regard to crew personnel, at the beginning of July thestrength in operational units was below establishment by more than 200; thereis now a surplus strength of nearly 400. During October 159 crew personnelpassed from Operational Training Units : in the same month crew casualties,including wounded and injured, amounted to 27.Conclusion.Taking the short-term view, the transfer of Coastal Command to the royal navy would not provide a single additional aircraft for the defence of trade. Theconfusion, delay and shattering of mutual confidence which would result from such a major surgical operation on the Royal Air Force at a criticial time wouldcertainly detract from, and not assist, our air effort as a whole.
Taking the long-term view, the problem is to decide whether our availableair resources would be best exploited by having one unified Air Force, or two separate Air Forces. It is my firm opinion that a decision to split the Air force would irreparably damage our effort to win the war in the air.The problem of making the most effective use of air resources between the competing needs of an Army, a Navy and an Air Force is not a novel one. Theproblem arose in an acute form in the last war when, after much wasted effort,it became necessary to amalgamate the two existing Air Services in order tosecure an economical and effective direction of our air effort.When Germany started to re-arm and chose the air as a primary weapon, shewas content to follow the principle which Great Britain had established in 1917,and set up a unified Air Force, which she has maintained ever since.The fusion of the British Air Services was decided upon at a time, when theproblem of defeating the air power of the enemy had reached a critical stage.Now the same problem has arisen again, but in much more formidableproportions. Less than ever before can we afford the luxury and the waste ofa divided Air Force. Air power is the key to victory. Let us not abandon theprinciple Avhich allows us to wield it with maximum effect.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, November 21, 1940.
