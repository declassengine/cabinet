dl3HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)TO BE KEPTIt is paauestUtiSECRET.W.P.(40)424.24th OCTOBER;  1940,WAR CABINETNEED OF NEW.. ZEALAND .FOR OPERATIONAL AIRCRAFT *Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.New Zealand ask for 24 Hudson aircraft with which to equip one squadron (plus immediate reserves) forbomber reconnaissance duties and the Air Ministry wishto meet this request^ in part, by shipping 18 Hudsonsdirect from the United States of America during the next two months.    The necessary armament would have to besupplied from the United Kingdom,,I am reluctant to divert operational aircraft from this country in present  circumstances except on grounds of strategic necessity,.    Developments in thesituation in the Ear East make it most important that new Zealand should be able to undertake effective air reconnaissance off her coasts but she cannot do this with her present obsolescent aircraft, which.have onlya short range and little striking power.If Japan became actively hostile a critical situation would arise; and it must be remembered thatit would be at least two months before aircraft could be delivered to New Zealand.At the outbreak of war New Zealand relinquished herclaim to 30 Wellington aircraft which she had ordered,for this role and deliveries of which were beginning.This generous offer was accepted by us with an impliedliability to supply replacements in case of urgent need.New Zealand&apos;s subsequent requests for Hudsonaircraft were not met,, though a promise was given in Maythat 18 Hudsons would be sent if Japan became hostile.Great disappointment was caused in New Zealand and* weundertook to reconsider the matter at the end of September.I now consider it important that 18 Hudsons should be sent.The aircraft are,  following the War Cabinet decision(W.M.(40)210, Minute 1(c)), under the control of theMinister of Aircraft Production who is unable to agreetheir diversion to New Zealand,,    I cannot accept his decision which is opposed to the considered view of theAir Staff.    I therefore ask the war Cabinet to decide.(Intld) A.H.M.S.COPY NO.Air Ministry, S.W..lp y
