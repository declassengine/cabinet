(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC M^dESTYJS^G^VERIWENIt is req levied that war CABINET.SPAIN.Report by the Chiefs of Staff..1x1 hia-TeOegram+1068 of the 19th November sir^&quot;BsnroEuLHoare has asked for the comments of the Chiefs of staff on&quot; tlxe strategical dangers of Spain entering the -axis.The strategic situation is as follows:-2c       The retention of Gibraltar as a naval &quot;base is vital tous for the rapid prosecution of the campaign against Italy,since, without the use of this base, it would not be possiblefor us to maintain the blockade, or to pass reinforcementsthrough the Mediterranean.3.       If Sir Samuel Hoare is correct, Portugal will followSpain.     If this is so, the Germans will acquire, in Lis&quot;bon,a naval base, which can accommodate all classes of ships,including capital ships, and from which they can directlythreaten the Western Patrol.     They will thus he in a very favourable position for making a still further breach in theblockade.     It will also be open to them to base fast surface craft, including possibly a &quot;battle cruiser, at Lishon withwhich to raid our communications down the Northern Atlanticto the Middle East.     Such raiding forces would be extremelydifficult to deal with since they would &quot;be operating outsidethe cover of our main fleet in home waters.l+a       It is clear from this that from the strategic point ofview everything should be done to prevent Spain entering the -war against us.5o       Since writing the above we have seen Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;telegram No. IO9I4P of 22nd November, 19U-0. This stressesJ the importance of immediate action if Spain is to be savedI from the grip of the Germans,     The strategic importance offeorpiriig Spain out of the war has &quot;been stated above and requiresno further emphasis. .(Signed)    DUDLEY POUND.J.G, DILL.0, PORTAL.+Annex I.^. .

ANNEX I.Copy of a telegram dated 6th November, 1^40,from Sir S, Hpare (MadridT^to the Foreign Office.No.1068.IMMEDIATE.Mr. Yencken&apos;s telegram No * 1054.I have carefully reconsidered our Spanish policy:_____in the light of interviews that I have had with Lard. Lothian,Dr. Salazar and the American Ambassador in Madrid,,I can understand the irritation that must be felt in Londonover recent Spanish developments, for instance the dismissal of Beigbeder and Suner&apos;s subsequent provocation over Tangier,American Press correspondent and his last visit to Germany.Taken by themselves these expressions of solidarity with the:Axis might well justify a reversal of our policy of controlledeconomic help to Spainu     It ..dght indeed be argued that       ja drastic policy would, lead to starvation of Spain would be ?the best means of getting rid of Suner, the man who is chief/lyresponsible for our anxieties.      Whilst I am not unmindfulof the strength of this argument and whilst on every personalground I should like retaliation upon those who are provokingus, I believe that this course is too dangerous^      It is inmy view too soon for us to try get rid of Suner.    If the Generalsact on their own initiative that is another matter.     For ushowever to give the impression that we were using the economicweapon to make the Minister for Foreign Affairs&apos; positionimpossible would be to rally Nationalist feeling regardingSuner.    He is already making many mistakes and becomingvery unpopular.     It is better to allow his failures to become evident and in the meantime to give hiu no chance of divertinghis personal unpopularity upon our shoulders.2. Secondly, a change of policy is too dangerous.     Therisk of driving Spain into German arms involves the fate of gibraltar as a naval base and grave reaction upon our Strategical position in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.It also involves the whole future of Portugal.     DoctorSalazar made it quite clear to me that the collapse of Spaininto German arms would carry with it a similar collapsein Portugal.     As I have telegraphed to you he was insistentthat in the interests of Portugal as well as Spain we must continue our present policy.,      Supported by his weightadvice I am definitely of the view that we have no other course at the moment and that we should be wise to maintain this policy with as broad an outlook and as much good willas we can muster, in this irritating atmosphere.      I admit that a serious complication has arisen in the attitude of washington and that I should regret any appearance of adivergence of British and American policy.    I feel however that the American side of. the problem has been very badlyhandled by United States Ambassador here.      I have seen himthis morning and he has again assured me that he agreesentirely with my point   of view.     None the less he hasconstantly hesitated to make the position clear here andin Washington and finally given a wrong impression of his views to his own Government*.      Ke has now assured.

rae that he is attempting to arrange that a modus vivendi on lines that there would, be publicity in Spanishpress for the wheat ship but that there should b&apos;e nodemand for a .public statement by General Franco of his policy.     The Ambassador is clear that General Franco wouldnet make such a statement and that if he did he would bringthe Germans immediately in on his back.     His view is confirmed, by an interview that he had this morning withCarceller and Gamers del Castillo-     Beth of them told him that with the Germans on the frontier Franco couldnot make a public declaration such as Washington demanded.I much hope that if you agree with my views you will instructour Charge d&apos;?A.ffaires in Washington to press them uponthe State Departments     It seems to me that we cannot afford a policy that may lose us the Iberian Peninsulaand the naval base of Gibraltar and that consequentlyeven if Washington refused help to Spain we should haveto continue it.     Obviously thi;j is a contingency thatwe should do our utmost to avoid.3. Finally I hope that His Majesty!s Government and washington will continue to keep in miiid the fact, that,unlike Mussolini, Franco does not wish to bring his country into war.     Spain is 90&apos;/0 against being embroiledand it is only an economic (grp, undec.) or an actualinvasion that will push her in ,     Suner will probablyreturn from Berlin with, an attractive economic offerfrom Germany,      I should like to face him on his returnwith concrete proposals for keeping Spain out of theHitler-Molotoff bloc,    Hence the importance of our signingthe financial and Moroccan agreements at once.     By thismeans we give his many critics an alternative policy.Even if our friends arid we then fail to keep Spain out ofthe Axis we can at once reverso our policy and hold upsupplies.      I shall be very grateful if you will urgentlysend me your views and as I base my case mainly cnstrategical dangers,I should greatly welcome any commentsby the Chiefs of Staff that you can send rae,     Pleaserepeat to Washington.Repeated V.

? a i\hi V *JANNEX&apos;   II.Copy of a telegram dated 22nd November, 1940,from Sir S. HocrOHadridT to the Foreign Office.No.1094.&apos; MOST IMMEDIATE.My telegram No, 1068.I regret to say that the internal situation here isdeteriorating very fast.     Nuncio who has returned after some weeks in Rome yesterday discussed the position with me and stated thct it was almost desperate.     We both agreed- that the machine of Government is in pieces and that no oneseems ready to repair it.     Franco&apos;s isolation on the onehand and Suner&apos;s attempt to concentrate every publicactivity in his own hands are to a groat extent responsiblefor the crisis.     Result is constant reduction in foodrations and impossibility of getting even meagre rations.The bad state of the railways and. shortage of road trans-port arc making impossible any effective distribution ofsup-plies.     Public morale is collapsing and a fatalisticsentiment gaining ground that there is nothing to be doneexcept to join the continental bloc     Facts that this state of affairs, is due to Spani sh&quot; misgovernment and mistakesthat the Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently been making in dealing with Washington only have the effect ofmaking the people feel more hopeless.     In these circuit-stances, it seems to mc essential for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to consider most urgently strategic aspects ofa Spain collapsing.     Considering it from the Spain end Ihave come to the conclusion that it would gravely set backany possibility of a French revival.     France surroundedon all sid.es by Germans would become a second Czecho-Slovakia.     I am also convinced that the Spanish collapsewould have a disastrous effect on the Eastern Mediterranean.If the Germans once dominated the Straits of Gibraltar,morale of our friends in the Eastern Mediterranean would be greatly depressed by their feeling that they were Isolated,I leave it to the Staffs to /grp. undecj? effect in the atlantic and other parts of the world.     It seems to methat upon the answer to these strategic questions should depend our future attitude towards Spanish difficulties,that l have described.     Supposing that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment take the view that on military grounds it is most important to keep Iberian Pensula out of the war, ifpossible for good and at least for six months, by which time we ought with Americans1 help /&quot;&quot;? bg7 in a strongermilitary position then we are to-day, question arises as towhether it is humanly possible to stop Spanish drift.     Inaturally hesitate to prophesy in the face of so manyimponderables.     Nevertheless, I imagine that you will wishHie to give my view without delay on this vital and urgentquestion.     Having discussed the question fully with nay

colleagues here, Dr. Salazar, Portuguese /jnbassador,Nuncio and others, I have come definitely to the viewthat there is still a chance of stopping the collapseand that the issues being so important it is worth taking-it.     I am, however, clear there is no chance of succeedingunless we can adopt a positive policy that will show ourSpanish friends that we can help and can help quickly.This means that we must be ready to act, preferably in immediate co-operation with Washington, if as now seemsmore likely President is prepared to help, but if co-operation is imposriible, by ourselves.     To put my view in concrete form, I believe that we could keep Spain outof German arms for 10,000,000 credits and supplies, thecost of one or two days of the war.     It would however,be necessary to move very quickly and to take some risks,in my view very small, of some stocks getting to theenemy.     I would gladly scome home myself and explain thesituation by word of mouth.     I hesitate, however, toleave Madrid at this moments, and I am trying to arrangefor Eccles to proceed to London as soon as he hasfinished his Moroccan and financial negotiations.     In themeantime, I would ask once again that the Cabinet should consider the strategic issues that I have raised andshould realise that in the present state of Spain we are dealing with, questions that, if they are not answered inthe immediate future, will become insoluble in aneconomic collapse and consequent absorption of thepeninusla by German.Please see also my telegram No. 1093^f&quot;two grps. undeco&apos;/&apos;Repeated to Lisbon telegram No, 79 -Saving.
