THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  November 1940.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (40) 448.November 14, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.RELATIONS  WITH  VICHY.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.I HAVE read Sir Ronald Campbell&apos;s comments in W.P.437 about the stateof affairs at Vichy.Although revenge has no part in politics, and we should always be looking forward rather than looking back, it would be a mistake to suppose that asolution of our difficulties with Vichy will be reached by a policy of mereconciliation and forgiveness. The Vichy Government is under heavy pressure from Germany, and there is nothing that they would like better than to feel anice, soft, cosy, forgiving England on their other side. This would enable themto win minor favours from Germany at our expense, and hang on as long aspossible to see how the war goes. We, on the contrary, should not hesitate when our interests require it, to confront them with difficult and rough situations, and make them feel that we have teeth as well as Hitler.It must be remembered that these men have committed acts of baseness on a scale which have earned them the lasting contempt of the world, and that theyhave done this without the slightest authority from the French people. Laval iscertainly filled by the bitterest hatred of England, and is reported to have saidthat he would like to see us &quot; crabouilles,&quot; which means squashed so as to leaveonty a greasespot. Undoubtedly, if he had had the power, he would havemarketed the unexpected British resistance with his German masters to secure a better price for French help in finishing us off. Darlan is mortally envenomedby the injury we have done to his fleet. Retain has always been an anti-Britishdefeatist, and is now a dota,rd. The idea that we can build on such men is vain.They may, however, be forced by rising opinion in France, and by Germanseverities, to change their line in our favour. Certainly we should have contacts with them. But in order to promote such favourable tendencies, we must make sure the Vichy folk are kept well ground between the upper and nether millstonesof Germany and Britain. In this way they are most likely to be brought into amore serviceable mood during the short run which remains to them.W. S. C.November 14, 1940.[21916]
