THIS DOCUMENT 18 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  November 1940.SECRET.W.P. (40) 467.November 30, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.DISPERSAL OF AIRCRAFT  FACTORIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.THE Ministry of Aircraft Production is spending a very large sum of money in dispersing the aircraft factories.In Southampton, where the Spitfire production has been centred, thetwo bombed factories have been dispersed to 38 separate factories.Weybridge-from one centre to 28 different dispersal points.Two-thirds of the Hurricane production will be moved out of Gloucesterand 48 separate factories are involved.Armstrong-Siddeley at Coventry will be dispersed to the extent of75 per cent, of the tools, from one to twelve centres.Rovers about half of their production will be placed in six centres.Westland. Yeovil from one to fifteen centres.The benefits of distribution are very many. The danger of damage frombombs is reduced and the working hours are increased.In the conditions that now prevail, the small factory offers better prospects of production than the big establishment.The broad principle employed is this : Premises that are requisitioned are paid for by the Treasury, subjectto rental charges against the firm.The removal cost is borne by the Ministry subject to a contribution bythe firm, taking the form of paying for lifting and setting down the tools.The process of dispersal has been carried out in many factories. Much work must be done during the next several months.The Shadow Group, centred in Coventry, is under consideration. And it is contemplated that other engine factories may be further dispersed.Two problems arise : (1) Conflict with other Ministries.Here it is asked that we should have a ruling that any premisesanywhere not in actual occupation should be at the disposal of theMinistry of Aircraft Production, if removal or dispersal is necessitated by enemy action.(2) The Cabinet should be aware of the immense expenditure involved andthe enormous sums of money that will have to be provided as thesystem of dispersal is developed in its entirety.-&apos;B.Ministry of Aircraft Production,November 30, 1940.Oopy No.    28[21966]
