General Review.The Home Fleet has been continuing the search for the Admiral Scheer and covering Atlantic Convoys.The Mediterranean Fleet has been transporting troops to Greece, andescorting and covering the passage of reinforcements and supplies.There are indications that an increased number of enemy raiders is at large in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans.U-boats have been comparatively quiet in Home Waters, sinkings from thiscause having been less than those due to air attack.A novel feature has been the appearance of U:boats off Sierra Leone.Imports in Convoy were much below the average.Home Waters.2. In the early morning of the 20th November H.M. Destroyer Campbell on patrol off Southwold sighted an enemy E-boat, which she attacked at close range.After a 20-minute chase the E-boat was set on fire and capsized. Seventeensurvivors were picked up.On the 19th and 20th November a destroyer force made a sweep to the north of Aalesund to intercept German fishing vessels, but nothing was seen. ThreeM.T.Bs. carried out a sweep off the Texel during the night the 19th/20thNovember without encountering any enemy forces.Enemy aircraft have been very active off the south and east Coasts. Doverwas attacked by 25 dive-bombers on the 14th November, H.M. Drifter Shipmatesbeing sunk and three other drifters damaged. On the 15th H.M. TrawlerDungeness was bombed and had to be beached. The North-East Swin lightvessel was shelled and damaged on the 16th. The Butt of Lewis lighthousemachine gunned and the Sunk light vessel damaged on the 18th. H.M. TrawlerSarpedon was machine gunned on the 18th and two men were wounded. On the20th H.M. Trawler Fontenoy was sunk and HM. Trawler Sunspot damaged bybombs. One enemy aircraft was shot down by H.M. Paddle Minesweeper Southseaon the 17th November and one by H.M. Sloop Lowestoft on the 18th.H.M. Submarine Swordfish has not returned from her patrol off Brest andmust be presumed lost.3. An attempt was made on the 14th November to refloat H.M. DestroyerFame, but was unsuccessful owing to a heavy swell developing. HM. DrifterThe Boys foundered in the Thames Estuary in violent weather on the 14th, and h.M. Trawler Jean Edmunds was damaged by a mine and had to be beached.The Polish destroyer Burza was damaged in collision with HM. Trawler Arsenalon the 16th November. The Arsenal sank and the explosion of her depth chargesdamaged H.M. Destroyer Arrow and a tug. HM. Drifter Go Ahead was sunkin collision with H.M. Destroyer Watchman on the 18th.The Town class destroyers (ex-US.S.) Lancaster, Chesterfield, Mansfieldand Sherwood have arrived in Home Waters from Canada.Some damage was done to naval buildings in the attack on Dover on the14th November, and to the Naval Establishment at Coventry during the night raidthere. Collingwood training establishment at Portsmouth was bombed on the15th November and 3 ratings were seriously and 14 slightly wounded.North Atlantic.4. Units of the Home Fleet continued operations in search of the admiral scheer and for possible survivors of the Halifax convoy that was attacked by her,but without result. Continuous gales were experienced and the search forsurvivors was abandoned on the 17th November. H.M.S. Rodney has beenescorting homeward-bound convoys and H.M.S. Revenge outward-bound convoys.Western Mediterranean.5. HM. Ships Renown, A rk Royal and Argus, with cruisers and destroyers,left Gibraltar on the 15th November to reinforce the air forces at Malta. Fourteen
1 78I li oaircraft were flown off H.M.S. Argus when in the vicinity of Galita Island onthe 17th November, but only one Skua and four Hurricanes arrived at Malta. Itis feared that one Skua and eight Hurricanes forced-landed in the sea owingto lack of fuel and the difficulty of finding the island in the prevailing lowvisibility. Search was made and one pilot was picked up by a Sunderland flyingboat; the remainder must be considered lost. Renown&apos;s force returned to gibraltar on the 19th November. , . ; -H.M.S. Sheffield intercepted the Brazilian s.s. Siqueira Campos off Gibraltaron the 20th November.   She was carrying German war material for Brazil andi       was sent into Gibraltar under armed guard.Eastern Mediterranean.6. Under cover of heavy and light units of the Fleet a convoy of ships carrying motor transport arrived at Piraeus on the 16th November from- Egypt,and another convoy arrived on the 19th November. Five cruisers carrying troops from Egypt arrived at Piraeus on the 16th November, and an B..A.F. convoy onthe same day.Anti-aircraft escort was afforded to a Greek convoy of troop transports fromSuda Bay to Salonica on the 17th November.Alexandria was attacked by enemy aircraft on the evening of the13th November, and on the following three nights. H.M. Destroyer Decoy was hit and had two officers and nine ratings killed. Some damage was done to docksheds and the shore base, and the dock was put out of action for a short time for repairs.  About fifty Egyptians were killed and a number wounded.East Africa.7. H.M.S. Dorsetshire bombarded Dante in Italian Somaliland on the18th November, and targets on shore appeared badly damaged. There was noshipping in the harbour.H.M.S. Colombo shelled a merchant vessel off Mogadishu on the16th November and scored two hits, the shore batteries replied without result.Colombo was attacked by aircraft off Kisimaya on the 18th and again on the 19th,but was not hit.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. Five attacks either on German or Italian U-Boats have been reported,four by surface vessels and two by aircraft (one combined). The combined attack,made in the vicinity of Alexandria by two Anti-Subrnarine Trawlers and a flyingboat, sounds promising. This is a delayed report of an attack made on the14th October.Enemy Intelligence.German.9. On account of bad weather air reconnaissance has not been able toestablish the disposition of German surface units.Reconnaissance at Bremen on the 15th November showed the new 8-inch cruiser Seydlitz still present and four destroyers, of which one was building andtwo were fitting out. Four destroyers were also observed at Brest on the14th November.   There is no further information of the other units.Italian.10. It is reported that of the battleships hit in the air attack on the12th November, one Cavour class is possibly beyond repair and that the otherCavour class and the Littorio will take a,t least three months to repair.Since the reconnaissance of Taranto on the 14th November, which showed that the heavy ships which had not been damaged in the air attack had left theport, there has been little to indicate the positions of the Italian main units.Dispositions on the 21st November were believed to be as follows: One CavourClass battleship at Spezzia; two or three 8-inch cruisers and two 6-inch cruisers[21942] b
based on; north Sicilian ports; two or three 6-inch cruisers at Maddalena(Sardinia); and four destroyers at Messina and four at Trapani.   . ::U-Boats.V 11- It is believed that the five German U-Boats which have been maintained,in and outside the North-West Approaches have been reinforced by two Italians,during the week, and there have been indications of at least one submarine on passage to Germany.The most striking development of the week, however, has been the appearance of a U-Boat, probably German, off the West Coast of Africa to the South ofSierra Leone. Four ships are known to have been torpedoed in that area betweenthe 15th and 18th November.There is news of the damage to the larger of the two Italian submarines inTangier which should be accepted with reserve. It seems that she experiencednavigational difficulties and struck the bottom twice, once amidships and oncebows on. It is thought that her keel is broken. She is still making water and the damage cannot be repaired at Tangier.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.12. During the week ending noon, Wednesday, the 20th November,76,182 tons of shipping has been reported as lost by enemy action, and of this total 69,050 tons were British. Of these losses, 8 ships (32,051 tons) were sunk by air action, 5 ships (20,352 tons) by U-Boats, 2 small ships (590 tons) by mineand 4 ships (23,289) by the surface raider which attacked the Halifax Convoy onthe 5th November. Five of the ships reported sunk by aircraft were attackedoff the West Coast of Ireland.East Coast convoys were attacked by enemy aircraft throughout the week with little success. One Convoy was attacked ten times between 1200 and 1500 onthe 18th November in the Thames Estuary. A Channel convoy was unsuccess-fully shelled by coastal batteries on the 17th November.Full details of ships sunk and damaged will be found in Appendix I.Surface Raiders.13. In addition to the Admiral Scheer there are certainly three andpossibly five enemy raiders at large. It seems likely that two of these are at workin the Atlantic, one North of 100 N. and one South of the Equator, that two arein the Indian Ocean and one in the South Pacific.The North Atlantic raider, which sank a number of ships to the east of theAntilles in June and July, may have returned to her old hunting grounds towardsthe end of September. She has sunk three ships certainly and probably two more,but the possibility that some of these may be attributable to Admiral Scheer orto submarines cannot be excluded. This raider seems to favour a peculiarly brutalform of night attack. The crew of the Anglo Saxon (sunk the 21st August) werefired on while trying to launch their boats, and the only ones who escaped did so because they were not noticed. This raider works on the Plate and Caperoutes. There is some indication that she has moved South lately. She is knownto have sunk one ship and may have sunk four more.14. . The sinkings by raiders in the Indian Ocean could be the work of one ship, but this is thought to be unlikely. It is believed that the raider whichcaptured the Norwegian S.S. Ole Jacobs to the West of Achin Head on the11th November represented herself as a British warship and made the capturewithout firing a shot. Nine ships have certainly been sunk by these raiders, andprobably ten more.It is thought probable that in the later part of August one of these raiders,which had been at work in Australian and New Zealand waters, retired into the pacific and replenished her stock of mines. She was thus able to lay mines in theBass Straits early this month. Our knowledge of this ship is much greater than ofany of the others by reason of the rescue of the master of the British S.S. Haxby,which was sunk by the raider on her way out on the 15th April.   The master was
taken prisoner and only rescued when the Norwegian S.S. Tropic Sea was intercepted by one of H.M. Submarines.on the 4th September.&apos; This raider hascertainly sunk or captured four ships arid probably one more. Of these, three ships were sunk by mines laid by-the raider.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. Seven hundred and eighty-one ships, including 135 Allied and 17Neutral, were convoyed during the week ending noon the 20th November, of thesenine are reported as having been lost. Two capital ships, 1 cruiser, 3 anti-air-craft ships, 14 armed merchant cruisers, 38 destroyers and 39 sloops and corvetteswere employed on escort duties.Since the commencement of hostilities 35,447 British, 4,564 Allied and 4,147Neutral ships, making a total of 44,158 ships, have been convoyed. Losses ofships in convoy have been 154 British, 20 Allied and 14 Neutral, a total of 188,giving a ratio of losses to numbers convoyed of 1 in 230 British, 1 in 228 Allied,1 in 296 Neutral, a total of 1 in 235.16. Owing to the presence of German surface raiders in the Atlantic, convoysailings have been delayed, and imports in convoy during the week ending the16th November were much below average with a total of no more than 500,758tons, compared with 695,119 tons during the week ending the 9th November, andan average of 883,365 tons for the previous ten weeks.Eleven tankers brought 126,927 tons of oil of various grades, compared with254,962 tons in 23 tankers during the previous week. Mineral imports were143,952 tons, of which 116,123 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore.Timber and wood imports were 75,683 tons, and cereal imports 77,332 tons, eightships being fully laden with grain.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.&apos; 17. There are signs that 5 German ships in Peruvian ports may be contem-plating a move in the near future.The Idarwald (5,633 tons), Rhein (6,031 tons), Orinoco (9,660 tons) andPhrygia (4,137 tons) left Tampico during the night of the 15th/16th November.The Phrygia scuttled herself just outside the breakwater when a U.S.A. patrolboat turned her searchlight on her, and the other three ships returned to harbour,the Orinoco having picked up the crew of the Phrygia.A ship stated to be similar to the Helgoland (3,664 tons) (sailed from PuertoColombia the 28th October) was sighted about noon on the 9th November in the approximate position 15c N. 73c W. about 5 miles distant from the BritishPacific Exporter.The tanker Germania (9,851 tons) sailed from Ponta Delgade in the Azoreson the 17th November. She has a cargo of 13,000 tons of aviation spirit and isbelieved to have enough fuel for ten days steaming at full speed. It has beenreported that she may be going to meet a German raider.Italian.The Fortunata (2,715 tons), which had been taken in prize by the French andthen given back, is reported to be unloading her cargo of 4,000 tons of toluol atKenitra (Port Lyautey) in Morocco.   The toluol is being sent overland to Libya.British Minelaying.18. H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 270 mines in the East Coast Barrier on the14th November. On the 15th November, and again on the 20th November,H.M.S. Adventure laid 279 and 280 mines respectively in the St. George&apos;s channel, and H.M. Ships Soiithern Prince, Menestheus, Port Napier, Port Quebecand A gamemnon laid 2,628 deep mines in the North-Western Approaches on the19th November.
- Minelaying by aircraft has been continued, by both Bomber and coastal command, though on a small scale, off the German and Dutch coasts and FrenchAtlantic ports. - o ,Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.19. Minelaying by enemy aircraft has been carried out on most nightsduring the week. On the night of the 13th/14th November, when there was littleactivity over the land, there were extensive minelaying raids off the East Coast.Parachute mines were seen to drop on the evening of the 16th November tothe east of the War Channel off Lowestoft. This is the first time that minesare definitely known to have been laid in or near the War Channel betweenOrfordness and Yarmouth, though mines have been exploded close inshore offboth places.The channel between Falmouth and Fowey cannot yet be considered clear,and mines are known to have been dropped by enemy aircraft off Fowey and the st. Austell Bay ports. Two mines have been swept in the channel during theweek.Four mines have been swept in the Dover field, and 2 in the Harwich fieldduring the week.The mine totals up to the 20th November are : contact 725, magnetic 786and acoustic 63.The casualties due to mines have been considerably fewer this week. four of them are attributed to acoustic mines, and 2 may be either acoustic or magnetic;none of them are attributed to contact mines.Mediterranean.20. Eight more mines in two groups of 4 have been swept in the area to thesouth-westward of Malta.   It is thought that this area is now clear of mines.During a raid by two enemy aircraft on Alexandria on the 17th November,it was thought that either mines or torpedoes were dropped off the harbour. Apair of LL sweepers is now operating at Alexandria and the second pair shouldbe completed next month.Four Corvettes fitted with LL Sweeps have sailed for the Mediterranean.Pacific.21.   Five mines have been swept in the Bass Strait minefields.MILITARY   SITUATION.Germany.22. German forces, including motorised divisions, are still held ready withineasy striking distance of the Franco-Spanish frontier, but it is probable that any decision to move against Spain or Portugal will depend largely on political considerations.23. In South-Ea^t Europe Germany continues to maintain concentrationson the Austrian-Yugoslav frontier, although as far as is known there has been no increase during the last week in the number of divisions there. The presenceof an S.S. division in this area is significant, as these divisions are usually moved to areas where active operations are expected.24. Movements of German troops and stores to Roumania continue andthere may be some 80,000 German troops already in the country. So far noGerman Army units have entered Bulgaria, but it is believed that preparations for their entry are complete.
25. The identification of two new divisions brings the total of identifieddivisions to 211.   Their distribution is believed to be as follows: Area.	Cav.	Armd.	Mot.*	Inf..

The following British troops arrived in Greece from Egypt on the16th November : -One A.A. battery (6 guns);One light A.A. battery (12 Bofors);And a proportion of R.E., Signals, Medical, Ordnance, R.A.S.G, &amp;c,personnel; approximately 2,000 ranks, including military mission personnel,and army staffs for attachment to Air H.Q&apos;s.27. During the past week the force of the Italian attack on Greece has beenstemmed, and the Greeks have been able to advance along the whole front. Theprincipal opposition to their advance has been from the air, and dive-bombing and machine-gunning has considerably retarded their progress. The Greeks hold the heights immediately to the East of Koritsa, and are shelling the town withmountain artillery. In the Pindus sector they have crossed the frontier in several places. In general, the mopping up of enemy stragglers appears to havebeen considerable, and a quantity of material has been captured, including35 anti-tank guns with ammunition, and 20 mountain guns.28. The Italian operations have up to the present time proved sufficientlyunsuccessful to demand the despatch of reinforcements and new commanders.It now seems apparent that the Italians, baulked by unexpected Greek resistance,and consequent loss of the initiative, are concentrating all their energies on theretention of Koritsa, whilst acting on the defensive elsewhere. The arrival of newAlpini troops is a possible pointer to the fact that a winter campaign may becontemplated. The struggle to retain the base at Koritsa is possibly an indication of the direction which any fresh offensive may take. An advance towards Fiorinawould be the shortest route towards low country.Yugoslavia.29. A hardening of the Yugoslav attitude has been borne out by reliablereports of the mobilisation of further units, and by the fact that the ninedivisions affected by the mobilisation order are being reinforced.Bulgaria.30. Reports continue to be received that reservists are being called up. Thenumber under arms is believed to be about 270,000.   Six to seven divisions are[21942] c
now concentrated in the south-east towards Turkey, and the same number arebeing concentrated in the south and south-west towards Greece and Yugoslavia.Few of these divisions are yet at full strength.Middle East.Egypt.31. The following reinforcements arrived at Suez on the 16th November,1940, in Convoy W.S. 3 :-One heavy and one light A.A. regiment.One medium and one field regiment.One field coy., R.E.Divisional R.E. for one armoured division (7th).One field survey coy., R.E.Signal units totalling 1,200 all ranks.Base and L. of C. troops totalling 5,000 all ranks.Equipment and stores for above, and ordinary maintenance stores for&quot;M.E.Enemy activity continues without any further forward movement.Sudan.32. Our forces at Gallabat continue to harass the enemy at Metemma withartillery fire.Far East.Malaya.33. H.Q. of Commander-in-Chief, Far East, opened at Singapore on the18th November.China.34. The Japanese have now officially announced that their withdrawal fromthe Nanning area of South China has been successfully completed, and the lasttroops embarked from the coast base at Yamchow. The majority of troops are believed to have gone to Hainan.AIR SITUATION.General Review.35. Successful bombing attacks on military objectives in Germany havebeen made on each night of the week, but during the latter part of the periodoperations were restricted by adverse weather conditions.The weight of German night attacks on this country has been considerably increased and Coventry and Birmingham have been heavily attacked. Daylightactivity has been on a reduced scale.Our bombers have continued their attacks on Italian ports and have lentvaluable support to the Greek army in Albania. Our&apos; fighters in Greece andLibya have achieved notable successes, particularly against enemy fighters,twenty-two of which were destroyed.Operational Aircraft Battle Casualties and extracts from recent RaidAssessment Reports are given in Appendices V and VI.German Territory.36. A total of 30 day and 515 night sorties were flown by Bomber Commandduring the week, and 78 night bombing sorties were flown by Coastal Command.On only the first two nights of the week was the weather suitable for full advantage to be taken of the favourable moon conditions. A feature of the week&apos;operations has been a heavy concentration on certain targets.37. On the 14th/15th November a heavy attack was made on communica-tions, targets and power stations in Berlin when over seventeen tons of high explosive bombs, six 1,500 lb. land mines and four thousand incendiary bombs were dropped.   The Stettiner Station was left enveloped in flames and heavy
damage was caused to the Schlesischer Station and the Oharlottenburg power station. Eleven of our bombers were lost in these operations. On the same nightan attack involving thirteen tons of high-explosive bombs was made on theRhenania Ossag Oil Refinery at Hamburg with excellent results.38. On the following night forty-nine of our heavy bombers concentrated on public utilities, shipyards, docks, industrial districts and other military targets in Hamburg. Many very large fires were reported in the Billwarder andMoorfleth Industrial areas, bombs fell in the target area of the Blohm and Vossshipyards, a 1,000 lb. bomb burst in the Barmeck Coal Gas Works and theRhenania Ossag Oil Refinery was again subjected to a heavy and successful attack.  During these operations a Hampden shot down an Me. 109.39. On the 16th/ 17th the largest number of sorties during the week wasmade, and of these one hundred and twenty-seven aircraft were detailed for another attack on military objectives at Hamburg. Cloud and severe icingconditions, however, prevented more than sixty-eight of these from deliveringtheir attacks. Weather conditions made observation of results very difficult but many fires and explosions were observed at the Blohm and Voss ShipbuildingYards.40. On the night of 17th/18th and the two following nights, our operations were considerably curtailed, but successful attacks were made on the twoSynthetic Oil Plants at Gelsenkirchen and on that at Leuna. Lighter attacks were also carried out on the oil plants at Mucheln (Lutzkendorf) and GrubeIsland. On the 19th/20th our attacks were widespread; three of our aircraftbombed a naval armament factory and other objectives in Berlin, two attacked the Skoda Works at Pilsen and a number of others caused considerable damage to shipbuilding yards at Kiel. Other targets hit included a railway bridge atLeipzig, an ammunition train at Aurich and the inland port of Duisburg-Ruhrort. This target was again attacked under favourable conditions by nearlyfifty bombers on the following night; six large fires were reported and the resultantdamage is believed to have been considerable.41. Throughout the week enemy aerodromes have been repeatedly attackedat night by aircraft from both Bomber and Coastal Commands. On a number of occasions direct hits have been registered on hangars and buildings and amongstaircraft, with resultant fires and explosions; the flames at Schipol andSoesterburg were visible over forty miles away. Coastal Command aircraft attacked Stavanger, and during a raid on St. Leger aerodrome one Me. 110 was shot down whilst taking off and a Ju. 88 damaged by machine gun fire. AtBeauvais bombs burst near fourteen enemy bombers, two of which caught fire,and enemy aircraft were hit whilst leaving the aerodromes at Poix and AmiensGlisy.42. The Channel Ports have again been attacked regularly with satisfactory results. Bombs have also been dropped at Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven and Emden.Lorient has been attacked on a number of occasions by both Bomber and coastal command aircraft, and considerable damage is reported. Leaflets were dropped by two aircraft on the Conches La Loupe area.43. Daylight operations were on a limited scale, but a few successful attacks were made. Bombs fell among buildings at Oostervoorne aerodrome and acrossthe stationary barges and warehouses at Den Helder. On three other occasionsships were attacked, but no direct hits were observed.Great Britain.44. Fighter Command flew 630 patrols, involving 3,061 sorties, by day aswell as 331 sorties by night. The proportion of victories to losses of aircraft andpilots has been outstanding, over sixty enemy aircraft being destroyed for the lossof only eight fighters and two pilots.45. The enemy approached or crossed our coast in force on only three days,and on each of them suffered heavy losses. On the 14th November a force of twenty-five Ju. 87 dive-bombers escorted by fighters was intercepted off Dover;fifteen were destroyed and seven others damaged.   On the following day two
fighter sweeps were made, one over Kent and the other over the Portsmouthdistrict. About fifty aircraft were engaged in each, and some penetrated to south-east London, where a few bombs were dropped. On the 17th a formation of italian bombers, escorted this time by German fighters, flew up the Estuary, but no attack was delivered.46. During the week the enemy made a greater number of long-range night-bomber sorties than during any other week of the war. On the 19th/20th.approximately 500 aircraft were employed; this is the highest number recorded in operations on any night against this country. Attacks also showed greater con-centration, and on the nights of the 14th/15th, 15th/16th and 19/20th heavy attacks were made on Coventry, London and Birmingham respectively;350 aircraft attacked Coventry, under ideal weather conditions, and 340 were used against Birmingham. On other nights fewer aircraft were employed andthe bombing was more widespread. Parachute mines are being .employed in increasing numbers. During the week about thirty aerodromes have been attacked,but damage was again very small in proportion to the effort expended, though tenaircraft were severely and twenty slightly damaged at Hawarden on the14th/15th November/ At DZythe on the 17th/ 18th a civil flying boat was destroyed and two others damaged.Coastal.47. Coastal Command has continued to carry out routine anti-invasion and anti-submarine patrols and offensive and photographic reconnaissances. A totalof 267 patrols and reconnaissances, involving 468 sorties, were flown and 115convoy escorts were provided. Minelaying in enemy waters was carried out on alimited scale by aircraft from both Bomber and Coastal Commands.48. Whilst on a special reconnaissance a Hudson destroyed an He. 115south-west of Lister Light; Coastal Command Blenheims probably destroyed two other He. 115 off the Dutch Coast and a Do. 18 was destroyed off HornsReef. On four occasions enemy merchant vessels were attacked and severalnear-misses were observed.49. As described in the Naval Situation, German aircraft are now inflictingheavier losses on our shipping than are their submarines. Although these attacks have been heaviest off the South-East Coast, the greatest losses have occurred inthe North-Western Approaches. Enemy reconnaissance aircraft have continuedto operate over the North Sea to the Faroes, from Trondheim to Iceland and fromBordeaux over Eire and the Atlantic, as well as over the North Coast of Spain.Minelaying operations off our coasts took place on every night except that of the19th/20th November, on a scale approximately the same as that of the previousweek.Gibraltar.50. Routine operations have continued. During the week London flying boats have flown twenty-five anti-submarine and reconnaissance patrols, and have provided four convoy escorts.Italy, Greece and Malta.51. Heavy bombing attacks have been carried out during the week onDurazzo, Valona, Bari and Brindisi. On the 13th November a jetty was destroyed and a barge sunk in Valona harbour; an oil refinerv was fired at Barion the night of the 12th/13th and a heavy attack four nights later by elevenWellingtons caused further fires and a large explosion.52. In Albania, Blenheims have bombed aerodromes, motor transportconcentrations and enemy positions; on the 14th a direct hit was scored on abridge near Koritza. During these operations five of our aircraft were lost.Standing fighter patrols have been maintained over Athens. On the 19th,within twenty-four hours of arriving in Greece, ten Gladiators shot downnine and probably eleven Italian fighters without loss. Since this action andthe successful bombing of aerodromes, particularly that at Tirana, therehas been almost complete inactivity on the part of the Italian Air Force.Prior to this, heavy attacks had been directed against troop positions, concentra-tion points and communications, seriously impeding the Greek advance.
53. Many valuable reconnaissance flights have been made over the IonianIslands, Sardinia, Sicily and Southern Italy. The loss of one Skua and eightHurricanes during an operation for the reinforcement of Malta has been described in the Naval Situation.Egypt and Libya.54. Many successful night raids were carried out by Blenheims on docks,aerodromes and military targets along the Libyan Coast as far west as Benghazi.On the 15th November bombs were dropped among enemy aircraft on the landing grounds at Sollum and Menastir. &apos; On the night of the 18th/19th November hits were obtained on ships in Benghazi harbour and an ammunition dump at Berka,and a hangar at Barce was set on fare.55. Apart from the raids on Alexandria, to which reference has been madein the Naval Situation, the only activity of Italian bombers from Libya was anattack by twenty-one aircraft on Siwa, which resulted in three military casualties.On the, 13th November Italian fighters attacked our landing ground at MaatenBagush and destroyed a Valentia troop carrier. Four Gladiators of the royal australian Air Force engaged a large formation of Italian fighters on the 19thand shot down at least five with the loss of only one, while on the following daysixty enemy fighters were attacked in Eastern Libya by fifteen of our fighters,who shot down seven and probably ten of the enemy without loss.Sudan and East Africa.56. Italian communications, aerodromes and stores in Abyssinia andEritrea have been constantly harassed by our bombers based on the Sudan andAden. The South African Air Force has carried out similar operations from kenya. In Eritrea the railway near Agordat, a fuel dump at Gura, the navalestablishments at Massawa and Assab, stores at Zula and railway workshops atAsmara have been successfully bombed, in addition to military objectives atKassala and Metemma, on the Sudan frontier. Assab suffered very heavily asa result of a prolonged attack on two consecutive nights; large fires broke out inthe power house, naval stores and warehouses. Aerodromes at Chinele and lavelloin Abyssinia were also attacked and at the latter two bombers were destroyed and three damaged. At Diredawa damage was done to buildings and to a railway line and bridge. Fighters have supplied a standing patrol over Aden on several days and have provided a number of convoy escorts.57. Italian bombing operations have been negligible. On the night of the14th/15th November an enemy aircraft was suspected of minelaying off PortSudan and on the following day two bombers attacked the docks there withoutdoing any damage. Aden was attacked twice, but no damage of importance was done.   One bomber was shot down and the crew was captured.Air Intelligence.Germany.58. Persistent reports affirm the increased accuracy of heavy anti-aircraft fire especially for height. It is strongly suspected that the Germans areexperimenting with some electro-magnetic device for giving the necessary datato their guns.Italy.59. The transfer of eight Cant 1007 bombers from Libya to Brindisi was effected on the 11th November. The aerodromes in Albania are now known tobe heavily congested, and it is therefore to be expected that a number of long-range bombers will be operating over Greece from mainland aerodromes such asBari and Brindisi.60.   It has been noticed that during the past week operations over the Greekfront have been carried out entirely by aircraft operating from Albania andItaly.   It is considered that this lack of activity on the part of the -iEgean AirForce may be due to shortage of fuel, of which there have been indications from[21942] D
other sources. There have been no Royal Air Force attacks against the dodecanese during the period under review.Spain.61. It is reported that on the 12th November an aircraft of the Italian AirForce landed at Son San Juan aerodrome on Majorca and, having refuelled, leftnext day. This is by no means the first occasion during this war that italian aircraft have been supplied with petrol by the Spanish authorities.It is reported, however, that some German, aircraft landed at Leon andSalamanca on the 5th November and that the pilots were told that, if they did not leave within forty-eight hours, they would be interned. It is believed that this story is correct, and also a report that the Spanish authorities had takenparticular pains to keep the incident a secret.62. A report, hitherto unconfirmed, states that twelve German airmen,including four officers, who had previously served in the Condor. Legion duringthe Spanish Civil War, arrived at Tetuan by air on the 6th November. It isreported that they will operate the Messerschmitt 109 fighters which form part of the reinforcements which recently arrived there.French West Africa.63. Two fighter groupes (44 aircraft) were despatched from Morocco toSenegal on the 12th November and are thought to be stationed at Dakar-Ouakam.Modern aircraft at Dakar and Thies now total about 71 bombers and about68 fighters. While the transfer of these fighters to West Africa will considerablystrengthen the defences of Dakar, it will proportionately weaken those of FrenchMorocco, which are now believed to be confined to a total of about 48 modernfighters.French Equatorial Africa.64. Fourteen French bombers were engaged in operations against the free french Forces in Gabon during the assault on Libreville; two of these have been captured. All the principal aerodromes in Gabon are now in Free Frenchhands.U.S.A.65.   The Philippines have been reinforced by two squadrons of fighters.HOME   SECURITY   SITUATION.General.66. The force and extent of enemy air activity is summarised under air situation.The week is noteworthy for a very severe attack on Coventry on the night ofthe 14th-15th November which is dealt with in the attached Addendum. andon Birmingham on the night of the 19th-20th November. There were other less serious attacks on Birmingham on the nights of the 14th-15th and the20th-21st November.Damage (Exclusive of Coventry).Aircraft Factories.67. Outside Coventry the only aircraft factory damaged was the AustinMotor Company&apos;s Longbridge Works, Northfield, Birmingham. Night work inthe motor shop was held up for two nights.Public Utilities.68- Five electricity Power Stations were hit, but in only one case weresupplies temporarily affected.
Eight gas works were hit, but only at the following four was appreciabledamage done : Gas Light and Coke Company, Bethnal Green. Gas-holder alight.Wandsworth and District Gas Company. Extensive damage to one department.Rochester Gas Works. Several mains damaged, and low pressureprobable for a week.Birmingham Corporation Gas Works, Windsor Street, Birmingham. Gasometer pierced in several places.No water works or pumping stations were hit.Industry.69. Although there were 31 cases of damage to general industrial installa-tions, only 5 involved substantial damage or interruption of work.  These were : (a) Siemens Bros., Woolwich (Electrical and W/T Apparatus). Productionsuspended owing to a U.X.B.(b) Burgoyne, Burbridge and Co., East Ham (Medical Stores). extensive damage to roof and main building, with delay in production.(c) E.N.V.  Engineering  Co.,  Ltd., N.W.  (Propeller  Shafts). complete stoppage of hardening process, owing to lack of gas.(d) Post Office Stores Department, Bordesley, Birmingham. One blockcompletely destroyed, another damaged.(e) W. Watson and Sons, High Barnet (sights). Serious damage and complete stoppage of production.Railways.70- Out of 77 railway incidents, 34 were in the London area, and 43 in therest of the country. It may be noted that while the London total is half that oflast week, the total for the provinces is three times as big, which reflects theheavy scale of attack on the Midlands.Other Damage.71. In London, Westminster Abbey suffered some damage to the roof, andthe National Portrait Gallery to one wall. A larger number of hospitals than usual were hit. The more serious incidents were at Battersea, where the maternity ward and child welfare centre of Southlands College were seriously damaged; at Friern Barnet, where one part of the hospital was severely injured;and at Mill Hill, where a serious fire occurred. Other hospitals hit werePrincess Louise Hospital, Kensington; the Middlesex County Hospital, Willesden;Queen Charlotte&apos;s Hospital, Surbiton; Grove Park Hospital, Lewisham; and theDistrict Hospital, West Bromwich.The most serious incident involving military property was caused by a parachute mine at Theydon Bois, when 20-30 soldiers were killed.Civil defence establishments were hit in London, Folkestone and Margate.Four fatal and four serious casualties occurred at a warden&apos;s post in Camberwell.Police establishments were hit at Chelmsford (County Headquarters) and in liverpool.Civilian Casualties.72. The approximate figures for the week ending 0600 the 21st Novemberare 1,190 killed and 3,738 injured. Of these totals, London suffered 484 killed and 1,080 injured; Coventry, 380 killed and 800 injured; and Birmingham (withWest Bromwich), 228 killed and 802 injured in the three raids.Unexploded Bombs.73. The number of unexploded bombs during the week was 801, 363 less than last week.  The total remaining for disposal is 2,939, a reduction of 130.Civil Defence Operations and Morale:74. The major Civil Defence operations for the week were at Coventry (seeattached Addendum).
Heavy duties also fell on the services at Birmingham on the night of the19th/20th and military and police reinforcements had to be called for. No details are as yet available.Morale and public spirit remains high, with great resentment at thetreatment of Coventry. Morale after the heavy Birmingham raid on the night of the 19th/20th is reported as good.Coventry-Addendum.1. The raid on Coventry on the night of the 14th/15th November is the firstexample of a night attack of maximum intensity on a target of limited area.2. The raid began at 1920 on the 14th November and continued ceaselesslyuntil 0615 next morning. Some .350 enemy aircraft were involved, and therewere about 600 incidents.The attack was opened with incendiary bombs on the centre of the City, the resulting fires illuminating the target for the attack by H.E. and. mines, whichwas concentrated on an area of a few acres.The ground defences kept the attacking aircraft very high, the fire-densityof the barrage being greater than that put up on any one night by the Londondefences. Our fighter aircraft were also active, but no successful interceptionstook place.  No enemy aircraft came below the level of the balloon barrage.3. A serious lack of water, largely due to the burial of hydrants underwreckage, interfered in the earlier stages with the fire-fighting arrangements :while the amount of debris in the streets made it difficult to deploy the variousreinforcements called in. Gas and electricity services were out of action earlyin the raid. Despite breaks in the telephone communications, accurate reportsreached Birmingham and London promptly.4. Police and fire-fighting reinforcements, together with military, weredrafted into the City early on the 15th, to assist in clearing, demolitions, andcontrol : all but essential traffic was routed round the City by police-patrolsat a distance of 8-10 miles.Soon after 1300 on the 15th the Chief Constable reported the position inhand, although all fires were not out.5. During the next two days further military assistance under the directsupervision of the C.R.E., 3rd Corps, was made available, together with Armyfield kitchens and travelling canteens.6. By the 18th, although gas was still not available, electricity was in 50 percent, production, the water position had further improved, while food supplies were abundant. Good progress had been made in the restoration of telephoneservices, and several important factories had resumed work. All unexplodedparachute mines had been rendered safe and the majority of U.X.Bs. dealt with.7. In regard to public morale, there was no panic, though a certain numberof people left Coventry. It is, however, remarkable that though on the 16th thePolice had made arrangements to transport 10,000 people out of the centre of theCity, only 300 availed themselves of the opportunity. This is believed to havebeen largely due to the remarkably steadying and cheering effect of H.M. theKing&apos;s visit on the 16th, which was of incalculable value.8. Coventry is the chief centre of aero-engine assembly factories and machine tools. Probably all factories have been more or less affected by the dislocation of electrical, gas and water supplies, and the effect on production ofthis factor has been more serious than that caused by direct damage to plant and machinery. With the exception of gas, however, the position has rapidlyimproved.The following factories suffered damage to buildings and/or plant:  (a)&apos; Aircraft Industry.Rover Coy., Ltd. (serious); Daimler Coy., Ltd., Radford (serious);Daimler No. 2 Factory, Allesby (not serious); British Thomson Houston(moderate); Alvis (not serious); Humber and Hillman, Ltd. (not serious);
Armstrong-Siddeley (moderate); Singer Motors, Ltd. (serious); Rootes, Ltd.(not serious); Standard Motors, Ltd. Aircraft Assembly Unit (slight);Riley, Ltd. (slight); S.S. Cars (serious).Production is entirely suspended at the following owing to dislocation of services :  Standard Motor Coy. Aero-engine Unit; Armstrong-Whitworth,Baginton; Armstrong-Whitworth, V/hitley.(b) Other Industrial Damage.Triumph Engineering Coy. (Components).   Completely gutted.Mandesley Motors, Ltd. (General Machinery). Machines damaged.Clarke Chiley (Cam bearing brackets). Material stores gutted anddistribution centre wrecked.Sterling Metals, Ltd. (Forgings and lastings). Serious damage.G.E.C. Telephone and Radio Works (Instruments). Serious damage.Reynolds and Coventry Chain Coy. (Chains and fuses). Serious damage to machines.Several other factories are reported idle until services are restored.(c) Railivays and Roads.The lines from Coventry to Birmingham, Leamington, Rugby andNuneaton were blocked and Coventry Station closed. In addition, the L.M.S.main line to the North was blocked. With the exception of the Coventry/Nuneaton line, all services were restored by the evening of the 18th.   -Damage to important highways was not serious, nor were any bridges ormain routes damaged.  All transport requirements can now be met adequately.[21942]e

Houses in the neighbourhood of the Savigny Platz and near theCharlottenburg Railway Station have been destroyed. Considerable damage was caused by flooding due to direct hits on the water main in the Fritscher Strasse.The timber fire previously reported was in the suburb of Britz on the night ofthe 24th/25th October, and a steam laundry was also involved.Stettin. In the first half of October heavy damage was done to the Vulcanshipyards and to the Freihafen. Twenty-one cisterns containing aviation spiritat a point 1 to \\ Kms. North-West of the town were hit and fired, the fireslasting three days. A factory near the harbour making machine parts is also said to have been severely damaged.Hamburg. Neutral businessmen have had difficulty in obtaining delivery ofgoods despatched via Hamburg. In one case, in view of the delay, the order wascancelled by mutual agreement, and in another case, in spite of notification on four occasions that the goods were loaded and the ship was leaving, the goodshad not yet arrived.Between the 8th and 11th October many works and installations on the Westbank of the Elbe were damaged, including warehouses, coal storage depots and oil cisterns of the Shell and Standard Companies.Stuttgart. An informant staying in an hotel on the night of the29th September was disturbed by a series of heavy explosions, in the course ofwhich all the windows were shattered. He observed that the gas works not faraway was on fire.Furstenwalde. Three bombs have fallen on the munition factory of JuliusPintsch. The building nearest the railway station has been rendered useless andadjoining buildings were damaged. The buildings concerned housed that partof the factory manufacturing ammunition and small-calibre shells.Railways. The Swiss Newspaper Die Tat reports that the Royal Air Forcehave made night travel extremely difficult. Trains do not stop in districts where an air raid alarm is in progress, so that you either miss your train or may be takenfar past your destination.
Mining. -The Finnish steamer Minerva, of 2,000 tons, has been sunk off theNorth Sea Coast of Germany, and a fishing trawler off the Skaw.At the beginning of the second week of November the German State Railwaysrefused to accept goods for shipment via Sassnitz or Warnemunde, and it is not known how long the traffic interruption will last. The Sassnitz route has been closed on account of mining.Reports since received of the Princess Ragnhild (previously reported sunk)state that 300 German Cadets were among those on board. One source gives theloss of life as 150 and another as 400.France.Boulogne. Photographs disclose that the jetty in the Southern part of the outer harbour has been severely damaged in two places, one third of its wholelength being destroyed. A large fire is seen burning on the heights aboveWimereux.Holland.Flushing.- Photographs disclose the following damage : Totally Destroyed. A group of large buildings on the Eastern side ofthe Flushing end of the Walcheren Canal.Severely Damaged. Two buildings on the Eastern side of the innerharbour East, two buildings on the Eastern side of the outer harbour anda group of buildings near the oil storage tanks on the Western- side of the inner harbour West.Four direct hits have been obtained on the Western wall of the outerharbour but the damage does not appear serious.
