.(&apos;ZHIS DOOIMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT/iMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOGIC &amp; key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P.(40) 433.4TH NOVEMBER, 1940.WAR CABINET.MERCHANT SHIPBUILDING.Memorandum hy the First Lord of the admiralty and the Minister of Shipping.   _The War Cabinet decided (Conclusions 254(40) of the 19thSeptember) that orders should at once be placed in the United states for the construction of 30 ships each of 10,000 dead weight tons (atotal of say 200,000 gross tons) and that the construction of a further30 ships should &quot;be considered &quot;not later than November 1940 in the lightof circumstances then existing or at an earlier date if in the opinionof the Admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping either increased losses or increased demands for shipping make this necessary&quot;.2. The Admiralty have sent a Mission to the United States ofAmerica to explore the possibilities of building there.     The Missionhave reached a point where they report as follows - &quot;We believe thatthere is reasonable possibility of placing orders now in United Statesand Canada for 60 vessels of 9900 tons open to be delivered-betweenautumn 1941 and end of 1942.     We consider it very desirable that ordersfor all vessels which you require for delivery up to this date shouldbe placed as soon as possible in order to secure berths and machinery onwhich United States navy departments are likely to make very great demands.As a tentative estimate we consider cost of 60 vessels standardized as above,is likely to be about 25 million pounds sterling.   Please advise urgentlywhether we may complete our negotiations on this basis&quot;.3. The deliveries offered are not as early&apos; as had been hoped andattempts are now being made by the Mission to improve them.     Moreover,it will be noted that the Mission believe that the price of 60 vessels in the United States will be about 25 million pounds sterling instead of20 million pounds which was the estimate previously put before theCabinet, and may be higher if somewhat better powered vessels are orderedor recommended by the Ministry of Shipping.     We are convinced, however,that in view of the abnormally heavy losses our shipping has recentlysuffered all 60 vessels should be ordered at the earliest possible date,the questions of size and price being left to the Admiralty and Ministryof Shipping to settle.4. &quot;We submit this for approval.     The attached extract from a recent telegram from our Merchant Shipbuilding Mission in America show show urgently a decision is required.A.V.A.R.H.C.Admiralty, S.W,1.4-th November, 1940.COPY NO.27

EXTRACT FRCM TELE&amp;RAM DATED 29th OCTOBER, 1940 ERQMMERCHANT 3EEPBUILDBI&amp; MISSION IN U.S.A.* * ft * * *5* Following is summary of present position which it is hopedwill enable you to appreciate the difficulties. We have now visitedall yards in U. S. who might be interested with following results.******(b) No large existing yards in U.S. can undertake work for us.(c) It will &quot;be quite impossible to get either Tanker or CargoLiner types.(d) Maryland are only interested in about four vessels of ,500 tons deadweight.(e) Waterman Yard at Mobile is entirely appropriated by U. S.Navy Department.     They have offered to assist us to build a new yardthere.     Capital expenditure and technical staff would have to beprovided by us.(f) Los Angeles Ship Building cannot quote as their output is entirely appropriated by U.S. Navy Department.(g) Todd Ship Yard corporation have been practically allocated to us by Maritime Commission in fulfilment of their promise to me tohold off and let us in provided we act quickly.     We have seen work done at their Seattle Tacoma Ship Yard and can recommend it.     Todds haveother irons in the fire and if we lose this chance Maritime commission will certainly give thera orders.     We shall then have to try to obtainships from Mushroom Concerns on time and time basis.     We expect Toddsfirm proposals with prices on basis originally intimated and machineryon about November 3rd and we must be able to give them definite answersoon after that.     Todds are the only source of ships in quantity andwe shall have to make best bargain we can with them on price.     The largerthe original order the lower the price will be and the better the delivery.Moreover placing a large order is the only way of securing capacity for as long as we are likely to want it.     We therefore press most strongly that we be allowed to place orders now for as many vessels as arelikely to be required in (corrupt group) future if we are satisfied asto pirice and delivery^      Only in- this way can complete programme be properly organised.     Details of payment and contract will be settled after decision has been reached in principle and proposed rate of dollar expenditure reported for concurrence if necessary.6.       Request reply giving full particulars of your requirements as soon as possible.     We return to New York October 31st or November 1st.Ends.* * * * * *
