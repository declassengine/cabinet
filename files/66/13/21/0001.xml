(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).TOBEKEPT(JN!DF 1W.P.(40)441.13TH NOVEMBERt 1940, /  COPY NO...WAR CABINET.1 - (VDISCLOSURE: OF SECRET INFORMATION&apos;/P0 THEUNITED. STATES OF AMERICA,Note by the Minister without, Portfolio.I circulate   to the Cabinet the attached Memorandumby the Chairman of the North American Supply Committeefor the early consideration of the Cabinet.(Intdo)   A.G.Treasury Chambers,S.W.1.13TH NOVEMBER, 1940,Memorandum by the Chairman of the north american Supply Committee.1. A consistent policy as to the disclosure of secret information (both operational and technical) has become essential to the success of our supply arrangements in theUnited States of America.,2. At present some Departments disclose fully, othersdo not.     Sometimes we give secret information at one moment,and are then reluctant to keep it up to date.This has given the United States Authorities theimpression that we give information when it suits our immediate purpose and present it in a form that suits thatpurpose, but are unwilling to &quot;put   all our cards on the table&quot;.3. I discussed this question recently with Lord Lothian.He believes it is essential that we should &quot;come clean&quot; orwe shall never get the assistance vital to our success, but herecognises equally that if we are to give information whichwould be of great value to the enemy, we must be assured thatthere shall be no leakage.He thinks that he should be authorised to put theposition frankly before the President and to promise fulldisclosure if precautions are taken to ensure secrecysimilar to those which we ourselves adopt.

4o I submit that this*is the only possible line to take.We are bound to give secrets (indeed have already done so) ofsuch a kind that safeguards against leakage are essential touso     We are compelled to give more if we are to obtainthe partnership in defence preparations, and the extent ofassistance, which we need,g The latest example of a problem which is constantlyrecurring is the request of the United States Governmentthat we should allow disclosure to selected firms of some ofour secret devices which Sir Henry Tizard has (in accordancewith his instructions) disclosed to the &quot;United StatesAdministrationo     The danger is obvious:    on the other handmanufacture is impossible without the further disclosureasked for. ...We must therefore, I submit, take the risk -and at the same time reduce it to a minimum by securingsafeguards,.     Among these might be the association withthe American Security Service of representatives of our ownin the factories in question060 I submit therefore, that Lord Lothian should be requested to approach the President as proposed above.     ItwoulA followp of course, that all Departments would need to implement the policy s? approved, and be prepared to send someof their best experts from time to time as required.(Intd.)   A,S,Richmond Terrace, SJJ.12TH .NOVEMEBER- 1940.
