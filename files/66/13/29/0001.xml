V a R .   c a b I N e T.USE of - teEOENMSira CAMP IN--KBtZDOUTOLAKD. &apos; -&apos;;Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for War.&apos;At tlieir meeting on 24-th September, 1940, (Conclusions 257(40)),the.lifer Cabinet decided that the Newfoundland Government&apos;should beaske&apos;d&apos;rto accept 1,000 prisoners of war if a camp there,- originally intended for oivilian internees and on which  20,000 had already been spent, see w&quot;,p,(40) 379, could be made ready,before the -winter set in.Work has proceeded on the camp and a further  20,000 has been spent, for which payment is now sought.   The Newfoundland Governmentanticipates that another  10,000 will complete the cost, includingequipping and a supply of provisions for the first two weeks.The Canada-United States Permanent Joint Board on Defence,have, however, expressed grave concern that 1 ^000 Gerraan airmenprisoners should be located in a camp only five miles inland fromConception Bay.   They consider this would present &quot;a Seriousmilitary hazard which might jeopardize the defence of Nev/foundland,&quot;and they refer to the possibility of a German raider reaching this area and freeing the prisoners as one of the more important factorsinfluencing the Board in this opinion.   The General Staff haveconferred with the Naval Staff on this point;   but, however unlikely2iiay be the contingency feared, they do not feel able to question theopinion of the Joint Defence Board who have presumably studied thesituation at first hand,Canada and Newfoundland have now been asked to consider thetransfer of 1,000 seamen from Canada to Newfoundland to make room forthe airmen in Canada.   If the Joint Defence Board raise the sameobjection to this proposal as to that for locating enemy airmen in thenew camp, then it appears that the only alternative for making use ofthe camp is reversion to the original proposal to send other civilian internees /
internees (Categories B and C) there.   It is understood&apos;that theSecretary of State for Home Affairs is reluctant to agree to thiscourse in view of the likelihood that some of them may become eligible for release under the new rules.The Y/ar Cabinet are asked to decide whether (1) the newfoundland Government&apos; should be asked to complete the camp ata cost of  10.000 additional to, the -two sums of  20,000 alreadysyjent on it; (2) if so, it should be used for interned enemy merchant seamen transferred from Canada provided the PermanentJoint Defence Board raise no objection;   (3) alternatively, if.the Board object to the course at (2), whether other interneesshould be sent from Canada, after careful selection, to .   .Newfoundland to make room for the 1,000 prisoners now in thiscountry whom it is desired to remove elsewhere on security grounds.     I myself consider that (l) should be accepted andshould hope that the Joint Board could be persuaded to agreewith course (2). -.18th November, 1940.THE WAR OFFICE.&apos;,
