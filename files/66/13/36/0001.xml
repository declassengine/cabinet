THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.TO BE. KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may &quot;be takento ensure the secrecy of this document.jjjQST,&apos; SECPJDT;,P. (40)4-5.6.S^EMBER- S-OTTi ,1940..r:voppseu New Minefield.Memorandum &quot;by the First Lord of the Admiralty.U-Boata operating in the Western Approaches are known tobe &quot;based on Lorieh-t, and when proceeding to and from, their patrols are strongly believed to &quot;follow a regular route close to the 100 fathomline.      Contact mines have already been laid off Penmarch, to the west of Lorient In the south-west corner, of Brittany, and magnetic mines have been dropped from the air in Lorient itself.      I now seekauthorisation for laying minefields as necessary in the - approaches to theCham;;si.      The two first lines of shallow contact mines would be laid in the following positions:-(a) from 480 32* North;    9Q 50s West in a direction 045o for 25 miles approx; and(b) from 48G.13? North;    9D 30?    West In a direction 045o for 25 miles approx.2, These positions which are some 150 to 200 miles to the west of Ushant and roughly on a line from the N.W. coast of Spain to theSi&quot;W*  coast of Eire, are outside the area? already declared dangerous,but if the&apos; mines were laid further inshcij, they would unduly hamper theoperations of our own submarines.    In   the positions proposed they are unlikely to be dlsocver-ed by the enemy minesweepers and they willnei trier endanger onx&apos; own submarines, nor impose any greater degree of restraint, on our surface forces than is already accepted in the heligoland bight.3, The plan of the leading U-Boat Commanders apparently is toleave their base in the first quarter of the moon, travelling largely on the surface, and to return again during the last quarter.       Therefore,ifrmy proposals are accepted, the mines will be laid during the moonlessperiod between the 25th November and the 3rd December.      The minelayerwould leave port after dark; and return before dawn,  so&apos;that thea$listenee of the mine fields, ought not to be. detected by the enemy.The Hague Convention requires no more, than that every possibleprecaution should be taken for the security of neutral shipping and thatthe danger zones should be notified as soon as military exigencies permit.Wsj. on the other hand, have consistently maintained the stricter rule,that shallow minefields ought not to be laid without first declaringthe affected waters dangerous,      But, in this instance,  secrecy is the essence of our stratagem, and the declaration of a new area additional tothose recently declared would almost certainly arouse suspicion.COPY NO.24WAS CABINET.Eq.ua.].ly o o
Equally, our strict attitude in the past may lead the enemy to assume that we would not now lay mines without some notification05, The enemy&apos;s boundless illegalities justify us in taking .any action which affects him alone9     No neutral ship approaches the UnitedKingdom from the south-west except under guidance from the royal navy.     Spanish ships do not normally trade with Eire ports, and theindiscriminate nature of enemy air attack would,  in any ease,  tend toAkeep the:::;, more to the west.     The passage of a Spanish trader over thPminefield In thus an unlikely contingency.      The  danger   if any, to neutrals will lie in an occasional Spanish fishing vessel visiting tb **fishing grounds nearby0      Indeed there is reason to suspect thatSpanish fishing vessels have sometimes been employed by the germans in these waters for reconnaissance.6. British and allied vessels also fish to the north of theproposed minefield, and the more venturesome may very occasionallypenetrate as far south as 49 0 SO&apos;.      If my proposals are accepted,the relevant Port Authorities will be intructed to inform fishing vessels that, owing to the activities of enemy aircraft and lightsurface forces the Admiralty no longer consider it safe for vessels to&apos;fish south of 50u. &apos;7o I consider that the risk to legitimate merchant -   shipping from, the proposed minefields is so slight that it may he.-accepted whenbalanced against the military importance of the minefields*      The mineswill not only lie athwart the regular track of outgoing and ingoingU-Boats, but will be a pitfall for the enemy&apos;s light surface forces which from time to time venture to make a sweep into these waters.Moreover if our traps snare only a single U-Boat, thousands of tons ofshipping and many innocent lives may be saved.S. I ask the Cabinet to approve my proposals.A dmi ral ty , Ss W016-November 20, 1940.
