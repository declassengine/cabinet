lieREPORT BY THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFV7AT5R SUPPLY AT GIBRALTAR.1. - On the 6th June, 1939, the then Governor at gibraltar (General Ironside) requested the provisionof a distillation plant with a capacity of 200 tons-aday,    i The plant required necessitated specialmanufacture, and the original estimate was that it wouldhe ready for shipment in February, 1941.2. An almost complete plant was acquired from theAdmiralty.    A request was then received from Gibraltarfor a plant.giving double the capacity originally askedfor (i.e. i+OO tons a day).      This necessitated .some alteration to the Admiralty plant, with the result thatthe first half of it,  capable of yielding 200 tons ofwater daily, will now be ready between November 17thand 20th.      The second half will not be ready tillDecember 12th,, ..   One boiler has already been shipped, andthe other is ready for shipment. :Movements have been warned to ensure that asuitable ship is available in the next convoy (aboutNovember 20th)^to take the first half of the plant andthe second boiler.3. Some delay in work in Gibraltar was caused bythe, fact that, after much work had been done, fissuresdeveloped in the rock and a new site had to be chosen.The Commander-in-Chief, Gibraltar, estimates that the plant should be in working order in seven months&apos; time,hut the Quarter-Master-General considers this an over-estimate and that it might well be halved unless thereis considerable shortage of labour./ k.
ij.. At the moment Gibraltar has sufficient v/aterreserve for five months&apos; consumption.     Every clay ofthe present rainy season improves the situation.     By&apos; Anril (the end of the rainy season) this reserve should,have increased to&quot; eight months&apos; consumption.5*       &apos;      The catchments are very vulnerable, and are bound to suffer some damage in prolonged, aerial ,bombardment:-  moreover the use of mustard gas might put them out of action for a considerable period.     onthe other hand, during the rainy s easonf which extendsfrom October to March, water collected from roofs &apos;in local tanks should suffice for the current needsof both the military and civil population. .  Thus itshould not be necessary before April next to encroachupon the five months&apos; reserves which are held in bomb-proof reservoirs in the Rock and cannot be damaged bybombardment.Provided, therefore, that the distillationplant is installed within the next six months and is ready to operate during the dry season next summer,ithe water situation should be satisfactory.
