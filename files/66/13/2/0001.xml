On theother hand., the situation was decisively affected from day to day by the swiftly moving events of war;      andin some respects the anticipations of the Joint staff had already been modifIede      For example, paragraph13 read as follows.: &quot;It appears unlikely that germany will advance South-Easwards through the Balkans in theimmediate future&quot;*The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances he would not himself wish to be committed to a preciseand formal adoption of all the proposals set out in thePaper.     He added that it would seem a very great and unnecessary expense to telegraph an immense summary ofthe Paper to all the Dominions,,     It would, in his view,be sufficient if a copy were sent by sea route to theseveral Prime Ministers, together with an explanationthat the Paper should be regarded as a Staff study, andthat owing to the changes in the situation since it hadbeen prepared, it had neither called for, nor received,the formal endorsement of the War Cabanetw.
