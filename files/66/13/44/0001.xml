THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (40) 464.November 27, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is reqieqaested that special care may be takaii toensure the secrecy of this documentsWAR CABINET.THE   DODECANESE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.REPORTS indicate that the Italian position in the Dodecanese isprogressively deteriorating. Recently the Commande.r-in-Chief, Mediterranean,and His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Angora and Athens have all recommendedthat an attempt should be made to seize the Islands.2. The seizure and occupation of the Islands is a strategical matter which lies outside my province but, if as I hope, the Islands may in one way or anotherbe taken from the Italians in the early future, there is one point on which we ought to be prepared.3. The question of the ownership of the Islands if captured from Italy islikely to raise burning issues between the Greeks and the Turks, and it is obviouslyessential to ensure that there should be no quarrel between them over the prizewhen captured.4. In order to avoid the danger of a Grasco-Turkish quarrel at the height of our struggle against Italy, it is suggested that the following solution shouldbe adopted and the Turkish and Greek Governments informed accordingly indue time :  (a) That, on the assumption that we shall be concerned in any action taken against the Islands, and in their subsequent occupation, we shouldadminister the Dodecanese ourselves in the event of their capture and keep them under British administration until the end of the war; and(b) That a decision as to the future status of the Islands should be deferredtill the peace settlement.5. As regards (b), we should insist at the peace settlement that the greeks and Turks should try to agree between themselves as to the future of the Islands.Eor instance, they might agree either to a division or, more improbably, to an autonomous regime under joint Gra^co-Turkish protection.6. If this line commands approval among my colleagues, I hope it may beagreed that we must be in on any attempt to capture the Islands, and that shortly before any operation for their capture, we should warn the Turkish and GreekGovernments confidentially that, if they are captured, we intend to administerthem ourselves, and that a decision as to their final status must await the peace settlement.7. All this lay-out might conceivably be upset if the Italian garrison wereto surrender to the Turks. Of this there have been rumours. If it happens thepolitical situation will be difficult, but we shall have to handle it as best we can.H.Foreign Office, November 27, 1940.11220   [21947]
