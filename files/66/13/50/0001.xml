(^IS-DOOUMMTJSJfKE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P. (40 ) 470.4TH DECEMBER, 1940,MCOPY no war CABINET.LOCKHEED LODESTAR AIRCRAFT.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Air.The Minister or Aircraft production wishes to convert the Lockheed Lodestars for Long Aerial Mine-layingI have not previously &quot;been consulted on thisproposal, although the responsibility for determining the use to he made of aircraft is that of the Secretaryof State for Air (W.Po(40) 300).The Lodestars have &quot;been allocated by the WarCabinet for the British Overseas Airways CorporationWest Africa to Middle East service.    Military requirementsdemand the reinforcement of this vital service to theMiddle East.For Long Aerial Mine-laying, in addition to thethree Harrow aircraft now available, I propose to allocate 18 D.Bo75s as soon as the necessary equipment for completing them - now in an advanced stage ofdevelopment by the Ministry of Aircraft Production - is ready.If, as I hope, the Long Aerial Mine is successful in operation - it has not yet completed full operationaltrials - I shall certainly consider increasing theallocation of DeB.7ls for this work.    There are 150 inthis country at the present time, and more are expected.No Lodestars have yet been delivered.

9 O OI havo .10 knowledge of the suitability of theLodestar for Long Aerial Mine-laying or of the type of equipment which the Minister would propose to instalin ito    Probably, a new type of equipment would haveto be developed and produced,,    This would take time,would divert effort unnecessarily from other fields of development, and&apos;would, by multiplying the types of aircraft used, add to operational and maintenancedifficulties in the mine-laying squadronsoI therefore recommend that the Cabinet should adhere to xts previous decision to use the LockheedLodestars, two of which, are now ready in America,on the Takoradi route, where they are urgently required,(initialled)   A.H.M.S.AIR MINISTRY.4TH DECEMBER, 1940*
