THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1940.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 466 (Final Revise).December 8, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.10 Downing Street, Whitehall,December 8, 1940.My dear Mr. President,AS we reach the end of this year, I feel you will expect me to lay before you the prospects for 1941. I do so with candour and confidence, because it seems tome that the vast majority of American citizens have recorded their conviction that the&quot; safety of the United States as well as the future of our two democraciesand the kind of civilization for which they stand, are bound up with the survivaland independence of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Only thus can thosebastions of sea power, upon which the control of the Atlantic and Indian Oceansdepend, be preserved in faithful and friendly hands. The control of the Pacific bythe United States Navy and of the Atlantic by the British Navy, is indispensable to the security and the trade routes of both our countries, and the surest means of preventing war from reaching the shores of the United States.2. There is another aspect. It takes between three and four years to convertthe industries of a modern state to war purposes. Saturation point is reachedwhen the maximum industrial effort that can be spared from civil needs has been applied to war production. Germany certainly reached this point by the end of1939. We in the British Empire are now only about half-way through the second year. The United States, I should suppose, was by no means so far advanced aswe. Moreover, I understand that immense programmes of naval, military andair defence are now on foot in the United States, to complete which certainly twoyears are needed. It is our British duty in the common interest, as also for our ownsurvival, to hold the front and grapple with the Nazi power until the preparationsof the United States are complete. Victory may come before two years are out;but we have no right to count upon it to the extent of relaxing any effort that ishumanly possible. Therefore, I submit with very great respect for your good and friendly consideration that there is a solid identity of interest betweenthe British Empire and the United States while these conditions last. It is upon this footing that I venture to address you.3. The form which this war has taken, and seems likely to hold, does not enable us to match the immense armies of Germany in any theatre where their mainpower can be brought to bear. We can, however, by the use of sea power and airpower, meet the German armies in regions where only comparativly small forcescan be brought into action. We must do our best to prevent the German domina-tion of Europe spreading into Africa and into Southern Asia.   We have also to[21964] b
maintain in constant readiness in this Island, armies strong enough to make theproblem of an oversea invasion insoluble. For these purposes we are forming as fast as possible, as you are already aware, between 50 and 80 divisions. Evenif the United States were our Ally, instead of our friend and indispensablepartner, we should not ask for a large American expeditionary army. Shipping,not men, is the limiting factor, and the power to transport munitions and supplies,claims priority over the movement by sea of large numbers of soldiers.4. The first half of 1940 was a period of disaster for the Allies and for europe. The last five months have witnessed a strong and perhaps unexpectedrecovery by Great Britain fighting alone, but with the invaluable aid in munitions and in destroyers placed at our disposal by the great Republic of which you are for the third time the chosen chief.   .5. The danger of Great Britain being destroyed by a swift, overwhelmingblow, has for the time being very greatly receded. In its place, there is a long,gradually-maturing danger, less sudden and less spectacular, but equally deadly.This mortal danger is the steady and increasing diminution of sea tonnage. Wecan endure the shattering of our dwellings, and the slaughter of our civilpopulation by indiscriminate air attacks, and we hope to parry these increasinglyas our science develops, and to repay them upon military objectives in germany as our Air Force more nearly approaches the strength of the enemy. The decisionfor 1941 lies upon the seas. Unless we can establish our ability to feed this island, to import the munitions of all kinds which we need, unless we can moveour armies to the various theatres where Hitler and his confederate, Mussolini,must be met, and maintain them there, and do all this with the asurance of being able to carry it on till the spirit of the Continental Dictators is broken, wemay fall by the way, and the time needed by the United States to complete herdefensive preparations may not be forthcoming. It is therefore in shipping andin the power to transport across the oceans, particularly the Atlantic Ocean, thatin 1941 the crunch of the whole war will be found. If, on the other hand, weare able to move the necessary tonnage to and fro across salt water indefinitely,it may well be that the application of superior air power to the German home-land and the rising anger of the German and other Nazi-gripped populations,will bring the agony of civilization to a merciful and glorious end.But do not let us underrate the task.6. Our shipping losses, the figures for which in recent months are appended,have been on a scale almost comparable to that of the worst year of the last war.In the five weeks ending the 3rd November losses reached a total of 420,300 tons.Our estimate of annual tonnage which ought to be imported in order tomaintain our effort at full strength is 43 million tons; the tonnage entering inSeptember was only at the rate of 37 million tons and in October at 38 million tons.Were they to continue at this rate they would be fatal, unless indeed immenselygreater replenishment than anything at present in sight could be achieved intime. Although we are doing all we can to meet this situation by new methods,the difficulty of limiting losses is obviously much greater than in the last war.We lack the assistance of the French Navy, the Italian Navy and the JapaneseNavy, and above all of the United States Navy, which was of such vital help tous during the culminating years. The enemy commands the ports all around the north and western coast of France. He is increasingly -basing hissubmarines, flying-boats and combat planes on these ports and on the islands off the French coast. We are denied the use of the portsor territory of Eire in which to organize our coastal patrols by air and sea. In fact, we have now only one effective route of entry to the British Isles, namely, the Northern approaches, against which the enemyis increasingly concentrating, reaching ever farther out by U-Boat action and long-distance aircraft bombing. In addition, there have for some months beenmerchant ship raiders, both in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. And now wehave the powerful warship-raider to contend with as well. We need ships both to hunt down and to escort. Large as are our resources and preparations, wedo not possess enough.7. The next six or seven months bring relative battleship strength in home waters to a smaller margin than is satisfactory.   Bismarck and Tirpitz will
certainly be in service in January. We have already King George V, and nope tohave Prince of Wales in the line at the same time. These modern ships are ofcourse far better armoured especially against Air attack, than vessels like Rodneyand Nelson designed twenty years ago. We have recently had to use Rodney onTransatlantic escort, and at any time when numbers are so small, a mine or a torpedo may alter decisively the strength of the line of battle. We get relief inJune, when Duke of York will be ready, and will be still better off at the endof 1941, when Anson also will have joined. But these two first-class modern35,000-tons 15-in.-gun German battleships force us to maintain a concentrationnever previously necessary in this war.8. We hope that the two Italian Littorios will be out of action for a while,and anyway they are not so dangerous as if they were manned by Germans. Perhapsthey might be ! We are indebted to you for your help about the Richelieu and JeanBart, and I dare say that will be all right. ;But, Mr. President, as no one will seemore clearly than you, we have during these months to consider for the first timein this war a fleet action, in which the enemy will have two ships at least as good as our two best and only two modern ones. It will be impossible to reduce our strength in the Mediterranean, because the attitude of Turkey, and indeed thewhole position in the Eastern basin depends upon our having a strong fleet there.The older, unmoderhized battleships will have to go for convoy. Thus even in the battleship class we are at full extension.9. There is a second field of danger: the Vichy Government may either by joining Hitler&apos;s New Order in Europe or through some manoeuvre, such asforcing us to attack an expedition dispatched by sea against the Free french colonies, find an excuse for ranging with the Axis Powers the very considerableundamaged naval forces still under its control. If the French Navy were to join the Axis, the control of West Africa would pass immediately into their hands,with the gravest consequences to our communications between the Northern and southern Atlantic, and also affecting Dakar and, of course, thereafter SouthAmerica.10.&apos; A third sphere of danger is in the Far East. Here it seems clear that japan is thrusting southward through Indo-China to Saigon and other naval andair bases, thus bringing them within a comparatively short distance of singapore and the Dutch East Indies. It is reported that the Japanese are preparing fivegood Divisions for possible use as an overseas expeditionary force. We haveto-day no forces in the Far East capable of dealing with this situation should itdevelop.11. In the face of these dangers we must try to use the year 1941 to build upsuch a supply of weapons, particularly of aircraft, both by increased output athome in spite of bombardment, and through ocean-borne supplies, as will lay the foundations of victory. In view of the difficulty and magnitude of this task, as outlined by all the facts I have set forth, to which many others could beadded I feel entitled, nay bound, to lay before you the various ways in which theUnited States could give supreme and decisive help to what is, in certain aspects,the common cause.12. The prime need is to check or limit the loss of tonnage on the Atlanticapproaches to our island. This may be achieved both by increasing the naval forces which cope with the attacks, and by adding to the number of merchant ships on which we depend. For the first purpose there would seem to be thefollowing alternatives : :(1) The reassertion by the United States of the doctrine of the freedom ofthe seas from illegal and barbarous methods of warfare, in accordancewith the decisions reached after the late Great War, and as freelyaccepted and defined by Germany in 1935. From this, United Statesships should be free to trade with countries against which there is not. . an effective legal blockade.(2) It would, I suggest, follow that protection should be given to this lawfultrading by United States forces, i.e., escorting battleships, cruisers,destroyers and air flotillas. The protection would be immensely more effective if you were able to obtain bases in Eire for the duration of[21964] b 2
the war. I think it is improbable that such protection would provoke a; declaration of war by Germany upon the United States, thoughprobably sea incidents of a dangerous character would from time totime occur. Herr Hitler has shown himself inclined to avoid the kaiser,&apos;s mistake. He does not wish to be drawn into war with theUnited States until he has gravely undermined the power of GreatBritain.  His maxim is &quot; One at a time.&quot;The policy I have ventured to outline, or something like it, would constitute a decisive act of constructive non-belligerency by the UnitedStates, and more than any other measure, would make it certain thatBritish resistance could be effectually prolonged for the desired period and victory gained.(3) Failing the above, the gift, loan, or supply of a large number of Americanvessels of war, above all destroyers, already in the Atlantic is indispensable to the maintenance of the Atlantic route. Further, couldnot the United States Naval Forces extend their sea control.of theAmerican side of the Atlantic, so as to prevent the molestation by enemy vessels of the approaches to the new line of naval and air baseswhich the United States is establishing in British islands in theWestern Hemisphere. The strength of the United States Naval forces is such that the assistance in the Atlantic that they could afford us,as described above, would not jeopardize the control of the Pacific.(4) We should also then need the good offices of the United States and thewhole influence of its Government, continually exerted, to procurefor Great Britain the necessary facilities upon the Southern and western shores of Eire for our flotillas, and still more important, forour aircraft, working to the westward into the Atlantic. If it wereproclaimed an American interest that the resistance of Great britain should be prolonged and the Atlantic route kept open for theimportant armaments now being prepared for Great Britain in north america, the Irish in the United States might be willing to pointout to the Government of Eire the dangers which its present policyis creating for the United States itself.His Majesty&apos;s Government would of course take the most effective measures beforehand to protect Ireland if Irish action exposed it to german attack. It is not possible for us to compel the people ofNorthern Ireland against their will to leave the United Kingdomand join Southern Ireland. But I do not doubt that if the Governmentof Eire would show its solidarity with the democracies of the English-speaking world at this crisis, a Council for Defence of all Irelandcould be set up out of which the unity of the Island would probably in some form or other emerge after the war.13. The object of the foregoing measures is to reduce to manageableproportions the present destructive losses at sea. In addition, it is indispensablethat the merchant tonnage available for supplying Great Britain and for thewaging of the war by Great Britain with all vigour, should be substantially increased beyond the million tons per annum which is the utmost we can nowbuild. The convoy system, the detours, the zig -zags, the great distances fromwhich we now have to bring our imports, and the congestion of our Westernharbours, have reduced by about one-third the fruitfulness of our existingtonnage. To ensure final victory, not less than 3 million tons of additionalmerchant shipbuilding capacity will be required. Only the United States cansupply this need. Looking to the future it would seem that production on a scale comparable to that of the Hog Island scheme of the last War ought to be faced for 1942. In the meanwhile, we ask that in 1941 the United States shouldmake available to us every ton of merchant shipping, surplus to its own require-ments, which it possesses or controls, and to find some means of putting into our service a large proportion of merchant shipping now under construction forthe National Maritime Board.14. Moreover,, we look to the industrial energy of the Republic for areinforcement of our domestic capacity to manufacture combat aircraft. Withoutthat reinforcement reaching us in substantial measure, we shall not achieve the
massive preponderance in the air on which we must rely to loosen and disintegratethe German grip on Europe. We are at present engaged in a programmedesigned to increase our strength to 7,000 first-line aircraft by the Spring of1942. But it is abundantly clear that this programme will not suffice to give us the weight of superiority which will force open the doors of victory. In orderto achieve such superiority it is plain that we shall need the greatest productionof aircraft which the United States of America are capable of sending us. Itis our anxious hope that in the teeth of continuous bombardment we shall realise the greater part of the production which we have planned in this country.But not even with the addition to our squadrons of all the aircraft which,under present arrangements, we may derive from planned output in the UnitedStates can we hope to achieve the necessary ascendancy. May I invite you then,Mr. President, to give earnest consideration to an immediate order on jointaccount for a further 2,000 combat aircraft a month % Of these aircraft, I would submit, the highest possible proportion should be heavy bombers, the weaponon which, above all others, we depend to shatter the foundations of german military power. I am aware of the formidable task that this would impose uponthe industrial organisation of the United States. Yet, in our heavy need, we callwith confidence to the most resourceful and ingenious technicians in the world.We ask for an unexampled effort, believing that it can be made.15. You have also received information about the needs of our Armies. Inthe munitions sphere, in spite of enemy bombing, we are making steady progresshere. Without your continued assistance in the supply of machine tools and in further releases from stock of certain articles, we could not hope to equip as many as 50 Divisions in 1941. I am grateful for the arrangements, already pratically complete, for your aid in the equipment of the army which we have already planned, and for the provision of the American type of weapons for an additional10 Divisions in time for the campaign of 1942. But when the tide of Dictatorshipbegins to recede, many countries trying to regain their freedom may be asking for arms, and there is no source to which they can look except to the factoriesof the United States. I must therefore also urge the importance of expandingto the utmost American productive capacity for small arms, artillery and Tanks.16. I am arranging to present you with a complete programme of the munitions of all kinds which we seek to obtain from you, the greater part of whichis, of course, already agreed. An important economy of time and effort will beproduced if the types selected for the United States Services should, whenever possible, conform to those which have proved their merit in our hands under theactual conditions of war. In this way reserves of guns and ammunition and ofairplanes, become interchangeable, and are by that very fact augmented. This is,however, a sphere so highly technical that I do not enlarge upon it..17. Last of all, I come to the question of Finance. The more rapid andabundant the flow of munitions and ships which you are able to send us, the sooner will our dollar credits be exhausted. They are already, as you know, veryheavily drawn upon by the payments we have made to date. Indeed, as you know the orders already placed or under negotiation, including the expendituresettled or pending for creating munition factories in the United States, many times exceed the total exchange resources remaining at the disposal of GreatBritain. The moment approaches when we shall no longer be able topay cash for shipping and other supplies. While we will do our utmost,and shrink from no proper sacrifice to make payments across the Exchange,I believe you will agree that it would be wrong in principle and mutuallydisadvantageous in effect if, at the height of this struggle, Great Britain were tobe divested of all saleable assets, so that after the victory was won with our blood,civilization saved, and the time gained for the United States to be fully armedagainst all eventualities, we should stand stripped to the bone. Such a coursewould not be in the moral or economic interests of either of our countries. Wehere, would be unable, after the war, to purchase the large balance of importsfrom the United States over and above the volume of our exports which isagreeable to your tariffs and industrial economy. Not only should we in GreatBritain suffer cruel privations but widespread unemployment in the United states would follow the curtailment of American exporting power. &apos;-
18. Moreover, I do not believe that the Government and people of theUnited States would find it in accordance with the principles which guide them,to confine the help which they have so generously promised only to such munitions of war and commodities as could be immediately paid for. You may be certainthat we shall prove ourselves ready to suffer and sacrifice to the utmost for theCause, and that we glory in being its champions. The rest we leave with confidence to you and to your people, being sure that ways and means will be found whichfuture generations on both sides of the Atlantic will approve and admire.19. If, as I believe, you are convinced Mr. President, that the defeat of the nazi and Fascist tyranny is a matfer of high consequence to the people of theUnited States and to the Western Hemisphere, you will regard this letter not as an appeal for aid, but as a statement of the minimum action necessary to achieve our common purpose.I remain,Yours very sincerely,WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.
