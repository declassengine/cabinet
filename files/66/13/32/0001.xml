1 D m .THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS 3RITA3MIG MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.It is requested that special care may &quot;be takento ensure the secrecy of this document.SECPJilT, /W.P.(40) 458. (/N0VBM3ER 19th, 1940.WAR CABINET.Proposed &quot;sink at sight&quot; zone no. he declared inthe Western Approaches in the event of an invasion of Eire.Memorandum &quot;by the First Lord of the Admiralty;.If the enemy should embark upon an invasion of EIRE itwould &quot;be essential that our naval and air forces should at once &quot;bea ole to attack at sight all merchant ships in areas likely to &quot;betraversed by the enemy!s expedition.2.      I therefore -propose that -( a) when information is received that an expedition is headingfor Ireland an area off the West and South coasts of Ireland should at once &quot;be declared dangerous to shipping by an Admiralty broadcast(see Annexe I);(b) notices of the intended declaration should now be preparedfor immediate despatch to our Missions abroad and to our HighCommissioner in Eire when the decision to broadcast had been made.3.      The area proposed is defined in the draft notice to neutral governments annexed to this paper as Annexe 1.    The area will extendas far to the westward as is compatible with the safety of o\ir convoyroutes to and from the north-western Approaches and it will give aminimum depth of 150 miles off the south-west coast of Eire;    to thenorth it covers Donegal Bay where a diversionary landing might be attempted.    In the south-east the boundary in the Irish Sea is thenorthern limit of the St. George&apos;s Channel minefield and the southernboundary of the zone runs down to and meets the existing Bay of Biscayzone leaving a free approach to Spanish ports.4.      Our naval and air forces will be authorised to attack at sightall merchant ships within the zone,  subject to two exceptions -(a) a channel will be left clear for coastal traffic to passfrom the Bristol Channel to the English Channel;(b) a few fast out\?ard-bound ships may be in these waters- atthe beginning of operations.    It would be impracticable to hold back -our attack go ensure their safety, but their movements would be known,to the Admiralty and, when the time came, would be speciallynotified to the appropriate naval and air authorities.    Moreover theywould at the worst be clear of the zone within S4 hours.    Warshipswill only be attacked if identified as hostile.    A draft of our instructions to the Fleet is annexed hereto as Annexe 295.      Apart from fishing vessels the number of Sire ships inthese waters is small, but it is plainly essential that for theirown safety Eire ships at sea should clear from the area of operations and that those already in harbour should remain there until thesituation is clarified.    I do not at present think it desirable todivulge to the Eire Government naval policy connected with the defenceofCOPY NO.2 4

of Ireland,  and I therefore propose that suitable instructions forEire shipping should he placed in the hands of our High commissioner in Eire to he placed before that Government when the necessity arose.%ie Admiralty would also in their original broadcast have advised all allied and neutral shipping to clear from the area declared dangerouswithout delay.    It is in fact unlikely that there would be more thanone or two neutral ships within, the area though conceivably there might be a few Spanish fishing vessels.    There would, however, inall probability be a number of British and Allied fishing vessels which would have to make their escape as best they could.    Instructionswould not be issued to these vessels until the direction of theenemy&apos;s movements was known.A.V.A.Admiralty,  S.Wc.1.November,19, 1940.
