SCkE T.\F. (40) 426. j COPY NO??6th QOTOBBR, 1940. /WAR CABINET.   /MEED OF KBW ZEALAND FOR OPERATIONAL AIRCRAFT.Memorandum by^h^^crg^x^JLSta^^c^i^niinion Affairs.I wish to support the Secretary of State for Air&apos;recommendation in his Memorandum No. W.P. (40)424.     We pledgedourselves to New-Zealand in May to provide 18 Hudson aircraft&quot;in the event of Japan becoming hostile11 and we reaffirmed this undertaking in August.      It is natural that the situation inthe Far Sast should be causing the New Zealand Governmentincreasing concern.It was not without considerable hesitation that theNew Zealand Government agreed in August to the despatch of the3rd   echelon of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force to theMiddle East.      Their anxieties are evidenced in the following extract from a telegram dated 19th October regarding prioritiesfor the supply of equipment for the land forces in New Zealand:&quot;..... H. M.  Government in New Zealand fully appreciate the primary necessity for supplying the needs of His Majesty&apos;s&quot;forces in the United Kingdom and in the Middle East but itseems to them, and they hope H.M.  Government in the UnitedKingdom will on reflection agree, that recent developments inthe Far East have radically altered the whole situation inthat area and that a serious attack on New Zealand, whichwould, some months ago, been generally accepted as a highlyimprobable contingency, must now be looked upon assufficiently within the bounds of possibility to warrant thepreparation of plans and provision of troops and material tomeet such a threat.      Recent events in this area have therefore caused H. M.  Government in New Zealand to revise thescale of attack against which preparations must now be made and their appreciation of the possibilities is adequatelyindicated by the steps that they are taking to bring NewZealand territorial force up to   war strength and to train thewhole of it. These plans provide&apos;for a home defence territorial force aggregating 45,000 of all ranks and it is of courseobvious that training of these troops will lose a great partof its value unless necessary equipment and material for their use in the war is provided in adequate quantities and atthe time.&quot;I gather that the considered view of the Air Staff is that13 Hudsons can be made available now,, and I hope that it may befound possible to release them.CRANBORNE.alNlONS OFFICE.
