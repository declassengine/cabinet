What complaints have the Admiralty against the present system?B. If the suggested transfer were carried out: (1) What operational advantages would there be over the presentsystem ?(2) Would the various stages in the training of pilots and crews best be managed in Royal Naval or in Royal Air Force training establishments ?(3) What would be the effect of the change on the provision of menand aircraft ?   Would there be any net increase of resources ?(4) How would an increase of &apos;&apos; overheads &apos;&apos; and an overlapping of functions between the RAP. and the FA A be avoided ?(5) How could an undue diversion of resources to defensive dutiesowing to the desire of the FA.A. to ensure its requirementsbeing met on an over-generous scale be best avoided ?(6) What would be the minimum number of aircraft the admiralty would require to be provided within the next twelve months ?[21948]
