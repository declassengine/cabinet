ICabinet War Room
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.THE Mediterranean Fleet has been operating in Greek and Italian waters,and aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm have made a very successful attack on theItalian Fleet at Taranto.The Home Fleet has been searching for the pocket battleship A admiral Scheer,but so far without success. The losses in the convoy attacked by this ship are less than was at first feared.Air attacks on our trade have increased, but not without considerable loss to the enemy, and submarine activity has decreased.Home Waters.2. The main units of the Fleet have been operating in the Atlantic in asearch for the Admiral Scheer.Gales have prevented operations by light forces off the French and dutch coast except on the night of the 7th/8th November, when destroyers swept westalong the coast from the Channel Islands, without result.There have been numerous casualties to small craft from mines. On the7th November H.M. Trawler William Wesney off Orfordness, H.M. Drifter Reed.in the Thames Estuary and a Free French mine watching vessel off Plymouthwere all sunk, the casualties in the first two being heavy. On the 8th NovemberH.M. harbour defence craft a.n. 2 off Falmouth and the rescue tug Muriaoff Ramsgate were both sunk and H.M.S. Winchester was damaged in the thames estuary. On the 9th November H.M. Trawler Elk was damaged off Plymouth.On the 10th November off Plymouth H.M. Trawler Kingston Alalite was sunk and H.M. Trawler St. Melante damaged. The balloon barrage vessel Marcellewas sunk in the Bristol Channel.On the 11th November in the Thames Estuary H.M. Trawler Stella Orionwas sunk and H.M.S. Vega damaged.North Atlantic.3. All but 5 of the 37 ships of the Halifax Convoy attacked on the 5thNovember (paragraph 6 of Resume No. 62) have arrived in harbour, and their reports suggest that the comparatively small number of casualties is due to thegallant action of the armed merchant cruiser Jervis Bay, which gave the convoy time to scatter. The Jervis Bay closed the Admiral Scheer, and was almost at once heavily hit and set on fire. She was apparently put out of actionin about 15 minutes, but did not sink until 3 hours later. Out of her crew ofover three hundred, 65 survivors, none of whom is seriously injured, have been landed in Canada.The search for the raider by the Royal Canadian Air Force from newfoundland, by the Royal Air Force and by HM. Ships has up to date been unsuccessful, but operations are still progressing. Atlantic convoy sailings havebeen restarted and battleship cover has been provided for them.Mediterranean.4. On the 7th November reinforcements for the Mediterranean Fleet,consisting of a battleship, 2 cruisers and 3 destroyers, which also carried military reinforcements for Malta, sailed from Gibraltar escorted by an aircraft carrierand other units. The ships reached Malta safely on the evening of the9th November and landed the troops that they were carrying. The entry of these ships into harbour with the troops fallen in on deck and the bands playingprovided an excellent tonic to local morale. Three Fulmars were flown off from.M.S. Ark Royal to Malta.The escorting force returned to Gibraltar, and whilst on passage aircraft from H.M.S. Ark Royal bombed Cagliari, where they hit the power station,hangars and buildings. From this raid all our aircraft returned safely. Theforce was bombed on the 9th November, but it was not hit, and reached Gibraltaron the 11th November. During the passage two enemy shadowing aircraft andprobably one bomber were shot down.
5. The Main Fleet, after operating in the vicinity of Malta in connectionwith the passage of its reinforcements, proceeded on the 10th November for operations in the Ionian Sea.On the night of the 11th/12th November an attack was carried out on theItalian Fleet at Taranto by aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm. The attack wascarried out by moonlight in the face of strong A A. defence, which included an elaborate system of balloon barrage. Notwithstanding these hazards and difficulties, hits with torpedoes were scored on two enemy battleships and probably a third, while damage was inflicted by bombs on a smaller warship and auxiliariesin the inner harbour. Two of our aircraft failed to return. Subsequentreconnaissance has shown one battleship of Littorio Class and one Cavour Classto be heavily damaged. Another of the latter class is thought to have been hit.Two cruisers and two auxiliaries were also damaged. Timely and accuratereconnaissance carried out by aircraft of the R.A.F. greatly contributed to thesuccess of this operation.Bad weather prevented a further attack being carried out by naval aircraft on Italian warships at Taranto which had been planned for the following night.6. Whilst the attack on Taranto was in progress on the 11th/12th November,cruisers and destroyers carried out a sweep in the Straits of Otranto, and sighteda convoy of four merchant ships and two destroyers. The destroyers, in markedcontrast to the action of the Jervis Bay, abandoned their convoy and made goodtheir escape, though one was hit. One merchant ship was sunk, two were leftburning and one escaped under cover of a smoke screen, but was probably damaged. It is probable that the two ships set on fire were the A ntonio Locatelli,5,691 tons, and the Ramb III, 3,667 tons, from whom distress signals were intercepted at this time. Aircraft from the Royal Air Force, which were bombingValona, sighted the two burning ships. Our ships suffered no damage orcasualties.Heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force attacked Taranto on the night of the13th/14th November, and from their reports it would appear certain that furthersevere damage was inflicted on the naval forces in the harbour.7. Under the cover of the Main Fleet operations a convoy sailed from Maltaon the 10th November, escorted by a battleship and light forces, and this arrivedsafely at Alexandria.  Naval units were also sailed from Malta to Suda Bay,The Main Fleet arrived at Alexandria on the 14th November, and reportedthat two unsuccessful bombing attacks were made on them during the operations,in the course of which six enemy aircraft were shot down.H.M. Submarine Tetrach reported that on the 4th November she attackedan Eastbound convoy of two laden and escorted merchant vessels in the Gulf ofSidra (off Benghazi). She sank one of these, a 3,000-ton ship, and possibly sankthe second.H.M.S. Aphis, in co-operation with R.A.F. aircraft which dropped flares,shelled suspected divisional headquarters at Sidi Barrani successfully on the night of the 9th/10th. Fire was returned by the land batteries without causingdamage or casualties to the Aphis.During the period enemy aircraft have made abortive attacks on Alexandria,Port Said, Suez and Malta, but no damage Was inflicted on naval objectives.West Africa,8. In the course of the occupation of Libreville by General de Gaulle5 forces on the 9th November, two sloops under his command entered the portafter the issue of the ultimatum, and found the sloop Bougainville which hadbeen bombed by Free French aircraft, set on fire and abandoned. It is consideredthat she is salvable. Three days earlier the submarine Poncelet was sighted onthe surface at 1545 by H.M.S. Milford and, having disregarded the signal to stop, was attacked with gunfire. The Poncelets hull was pierced by a shell thatdid not explode, andrshe then dived. Water entered her hull and she surfaced andwas again engaged. The crew then came on deck and surrendered after scuttlingthe submarine. The Poncelet&apos;s log book which was taken showed that at 1420orders had been given to fire two torpedoes at Milford. One torpedo had beenfired but the other one had stuck in the tube.[21922] B
East Indies.9. On the 10th November the Norwegian Ole Jacobs (8,306 tons) reportedbeing shelled about 300 miles west of Acheh Head (North Sumatra) and subsequentsignals appeared to indicate that she had been captured by a raider.In the early morning of the 11th November part of a distress signal from theS.S. Automedon (7,528 tons) was intercepted, but the longitude given and theremainder of the signal were intentionally jammed. The Automedon was on passage from Durban to Penang and the latitude given was about 100 miles tothe south of Ole Jacobs&apos; position.H.M. Ships and aircraft are carrying out a search in the area.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. There has been little U-Boat activity during the week and only oneattack on a known submarine target has been reported. This was carried out byH.M. Ships Havelock and Hesperus 350 miles west of the Bloody Foreland. Theysighted the U-Boat on the surface 5 miles away and made two attacks, after which they lost contact.  A large patch of oil came to the surface.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending noon, Wednesday, the 13th November,64,832 tons of shipping has been reported as lost by enemy action, and of this total53,649 tons were British.Of these losses, six ships (27,461 tons) were sunk by air action, five ships(15,834 tons) were mined (two of them in the Bass Strait), one ship (5,612 tons)was torpedoed by submarine, and one ship (10,042 tons) was sunk by surface raiderin the attack on the Halifax Convoy on the 5th November. From this convoythere are, in addition, 4 ships (26,332 tons) still unaccounted for, and it isprobable that the majority of these are sunk. In addition to the sinkings, damage has been caused to 18 ships (64,165 tons), mainly by direct action by aircraft.As will be seen from the above figures, the air attack on our trade has been intensified.The majority of the casualties from aircraft have occurred off the east coast, where attacks have been made in formation, but here enemy aircraftsuffered severe casualties from the A.A. fire of the naval escorts as well as the attacks of our fighter patrols. On the 8th November H.M.S. Winchester,escorting a north-bound convoy, shot down 2 enemy aircraft and damaged2 others; she was subsequently damaged by a mine explosion and forced toanchor.  Whilst anchored she was damaged by near-bomb misses.On the 9th a convoy was attacked off Harwich, and H.M.S. Vanity shot down one bomber and damaged another. On the 11th November convoys were again attacked in the Thames Estuary and the escorting ships destroyed fiveaircraft, probably destroyed a sixth and damaged a seventh. Of these,H.M.S. Vimiera destroyed two Ju 87&apos;s, H.M.S. Viven destroyed one andprobably brought down a second unspecified Ju., H.M.S. Londonderry alsodestroyed a Junkers, and H.M. Tug St. Mellons destroyed one Messerschmidtand damaged another. Attacks on shipping in the Western Approaches by single aircraft have continued.Details of the shipping losses are shown in Appendix I, and the chartattached to this resume shows the week-by-week losses since the start of the war;These figures are now, and will in future, be given up to Wednesday noon each week.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. Nine hundred and six ships, including 163 allied and 30 neutral, were convoyed during the week ending noon the 13th November. Two capital ships,a cruiser, 2 anti-aircraft ships, 12 armed merchant cruisers, 42 destroyers and36 sloops and corvettes have been employed on escort duty.Since the beginning of the war 43,377 ships of approximately 150 million gross tons with a carrying capacity of 225 million tons have been convoyed
and, of these, 179 ships of 850,000 gross tons have been lost; a percentageof -57 per cent.Imports by ships in convoy during the week ending the 9th Novembertotalled 695,119 tons, compared with 1,129,655 tons during the week ending the2nd November and an average of 905,628 tons for the previous ten weeks.Twenty-three tankers brought 254,962 tons of oil of various grades, comparedwith 291,390 tons in 27 tankers during the previous week. Mineral imports were 171,194 tons, of which 100,978 tons were steel, pig iron, scrap iron andiron ore. Timber and wood pulp imports were 60,507 tons and cereal imports79,044 tons, eight ships being fully loaded with grain. Other food importstotalled 69,282 tons.Enemy Intelligence.German.13. Reports, which are at present unconfirmed, state that on the4th November Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were no longer in Kiel, but that the battleship Schleswig Holstein was said to be approaching Kiel on the same day.The whereabouts of Tirpitz, Hipper, Prinz Eugen, Koln and nurnberg are atpresent unknown. The number of destroyers in French occupied ports isdoubtful, but there were indications early in the week that only four remained in Brest.There have been as many as five submarines operating in the North-western approaches throughout the week. One of them, which has been reported as farnorth as 61has probably been mainly engaged in reporting the weather. Therehave also been indications of submarines on passage to and from Lorient and ofone returning to Germany.Italian.14. There have been continued air reconnaissances of Italian Naval portsduring the past week. On the 7th November these gave : Taranto, 5 battleships,5 cruisers and 4 destroyers in the Outer Harbour and 2 cruisers and 6 destroyers in the Inner; Brindisi, four cruisers and an unspecified number of destroyers.A later reconnaissance gave five battleships and five cruisers at Taranto on the10th November, but this was changed to six battleships from the observation afterthe F.A.A. attack. Reconnaissances carried out over the Sicilian ports on the9th November showed considerable groups of merchant shipping with destroyersat Trapani, Palermo and Messina, and a concentration of seven destroyers atAugusta.There seems to have been at least one Italian submarine on patrol near the azores during the current week, and there have been indications of Italiansubmarines as far north as the Western Approaches. It seems likely that the attack made by H.M.C.S. Ottawa about 260 miles west of the Fastnet on the6th November was against an Italian submarine, which may have been damaged and then returned to Bordeaux. According to the latest reports, the damage tothe two Italian submarines still in Tangier harbour seems to be genuine. On the11th November Senor Suner informed a member of the American Embassy atMadrid that the two Italian submarines would have to leave Tangier &quot; at theend of 20 days &quot; as from the date of their arrival, i.e., the 23rd and 24th Novemberrespectively. From the instructions issued to Italian submarines working in theMediterranean it appears that the Italians have established a system of shore-operated hydrophones at various points on the coasts of Italy and Cyrenaica.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.15. A reconnaissance of Bremerhaven on the 3rd November showed that both the Bremen and the Europa had left. One or the other of these liners waslocated in Brunsbiittel on the 4th November.Further information has been received about the chartering of Norwegianships by Germany. Two of these, each of some 1,700 tons, were sailing fromOslo for Northern ports on the 11th and 12th November respectively, andthree other ships of similar size are known to have been chartered for the same
purpose. It is reported from Oslo shipping circles that at Christiarisand theGermans are offering high figures for the services of coastal - steamers to carryammunition north from that port.A Norwegian woman who was saved from the Princesse Ragnhild (1,590tons), which sank off Haugesund on the 25th October, states that among the passengers were some 300 German army cadets most of whom were drowned.Fifty tons of lubricating oil are said to have been transferred from the tanker Brake at Vigo to the tanker Max Albrecht (5,824 tons) at Ferrol on the9th November. On the same day the tanker Antarktis (10,711 tons) also at Vigo,received two ten-ton lorry loads of provisions. She is believed to have on board16,000 tons of gas oil and 2,100 tons of lubricating oil.The Balkan (2,209 tons) and the Stormarn (1,459 tons) both left Bilbao onthe 8th November loaded with iron ore and were probably making for Bayonne.On the 7th November the Delos arrived at Galatz with 4,000 tons of grainfrom Russia. The Cordelia arrived at Galatz from Russia on the 11th Novemberwith 1,070 tons of castor oil in drums.At Tampico, Mexico, the Idarwald (5,033 tons) was loading 200 tons of coalon the 5th November. She has recently had extensive repairs carried out and isexpected to sail. The tanker Orinoco (9,660 tons) has taken on large quantitiesof foodstuffs and is also expected to sail.The Norderney (3,667 tons) at Para, Brazil, has been loading 1,000 tons ofcoal. She has a crew of 14 men and 7 officers, of whom 8 men and 5 officersrecently joined, having come from Santos. It is rumoured that she will soon besailing.Italian.16. Steamers totalling some 20,000 tons were reported to be plying dailybetween Bari and Albanian ports.The Gaeta (4,457 tons), which has been at Huelva since the 10th June, is nowunloading her cargo and putting it on the railway.A report has been received stating that the four Italian tankers in PuertoCabello, Venezuela, have been interned.British Minelaying.17. F .M. Ships Southern Prince, Menestheus, Port Napier, Port Quebecand A dventure carried out minelaying operations in the North-West Approacheson the 8th November and again on the 12th November. On the first occasion2,369 deep mines were laid, and on the second about 2,500. Minelaying by aircraft has been continued by Bomber Command on the North-West coast of Germany andthe Atlantic coast of France.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.18. Minelaying by enemy aircraft has been carried out on a considerable scale during the past week. Plymouth, the Bristol Channel ports, and the thames estuary have received the most attention. It appears that for some months nowno aircraft have dropped mines between Portland and the North Foreland.It has been established that an enemy aircraft frequently lays two mines,one magnetic and the other acoustic, not more than a quarter of a mile apart.Acoustic mines have been found in waters, such as the War Channel, where the depth precludes the magnetic mine.Of seventeen recent casualties none have been caused by contact mines. Nineare believed to be due to acoustic mines, five to magnetic mines, the other threebeing doubtful.Fleet sweepers are operating in the Harwich area, and three mines were destroyed there during the week.Eight contact mines have been cut or exploded in the Dover area and tenexplosive cutters have been found. The percentage of cutters to mines in this area appears to be very high.Six mines have been cleared from the Falmouth-Fowey channel during theweek.Fourteen magnetic mines have been exploded by LL sweeps during the week,bringing the total exploded by LL sweeps to date to 543.   The total of magnetic
mines dealt with excluding those dropped on land is 771, of contact mines 704,and of acoustic mines 62. During the week 14 acoustic mines have been detonatedby H.M. Ships passing close to them.Enemy seaplanes were seen to drop mines to seaward of the War Channeloff Whitby on the 10th November, and a dangerous area was declared.Searched channels were established in the Thames Estuary for the innerapproaches to the Thames and Medway gates on the 9th November. The Medwaygate had been closed since the 13tih October.The Mediterranean.19. Enemy mines have been reported 45 miles north-east of Port Said, anda dangerous area has been declared.The four LL whalers on passage to the Mediterranean reached Freetown onthe 11th November.H.M. Minesweepers Huntley and Derby, which have been transferred fromthe East Indies station to the Mediterranean, have arrived at Alexandria.Pacific.20. Mines have been1 found in the Bass Strait, presumably laid by anenemy raider. &quot; &quot;MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.21. Since the end of the campaign in France there have been reports thata large number of German divisions have been demobilized. Undoubtedly a largenumber of men are being released from the colours, but probably only temporarily.It is considered that any such releases are more than compensated for by thenumber of men being called up for training, and the net result of these changesis that there has been an increase in the total number of German divisions; thepresent General Staff figure of 209 divisions may be an under-estimate.22. A big programme of motorisation and mechanization is being carriedout. Some confirmation of this has already been obtained through identifications.At the end of the French campaign not more than ten armoured divisions werefit for active operations, but it is believed that there is now a minimum of thirteenfully-equipped armoured divisions. Similarly there appears to have been anincrease in the number of motorised divisions. Whereas last July there weresix motorised divisions, it is possible that there may now be as many as fifteen(some newly-formed divisions, and some converted infantry divisions), though this figure has not yet been confirmed by identifications.23.

Faroe Islands.24. The following reinforcements disembarked at Thorshavn ex S.S. Addaon the 12th November, 1940: 205 Coast Battery, R.A.421 Coast Battery, R.A.Lovat ScoutsDepot R.A.Malta.25. The following reinforcements arrived at Malta in ELM. ships on the10th November, 1940 : 1 Inf. Battalion.2 Fd. Batteries 25-pdrs.1 Independent Troop Tanks.2 Heavy A.A. Batteries.1 Light A.A. Battery.The total number of men is approximately 2.100.Guns and vehicles for these troops have not yet arrived.Tangier.26. About the beginning of November, Spanish reinforcements of infantry and artillery reached Tangier. Their strength at present is estimated at some50 guns of various types, 4,000 native troops and at least one battalion of Spainshtroops including some Foreign Legion elements. The ostensible reason given forthis measure was &quot;in order to maintain the neutrality of Tangier.&quot;The Balkan States.Greece.27. There is considerable evidence that Greek resistance to invasion hassurprised and disarranged her invaders, and heartened her neighbours. Herresistance so far has not only been effective generally along the whole front,but in the northern sector her forces are now holding a line within the Albanianfrontier and overlooking the Italian main road from Koritza. In the Pindussector Greek forces are already back on the frontier, having first of all surroundedand then attacked and put to flight strong elements (if not the whole) of an ItalianAlpine Division. Italian casualties in dead, wounded, and especially prisonersare reported to have been high in this action. Local Greek successes are also reported from other parts of the front. In the Epirus sector pressure by strongItalian forces at first compelled the Greek left flank to withdraw; but this pressurehas recently relaxed, and Greek forces are again advancing towards their originaldefence line.28. Greek morale remains high, although sorely tried by constant Italianair attacks both on forward troops and on other objectives, military and non-military. News of recent Italian activities in Albania which almost certainlypresage a renewed and stronger offensive against Greece, indicates that theresults of the campaign so far have not appreciably altered the seriousness ofthe military situation.29. The following British troops arrived at Suda Bay in Crete on the7th November, 1940 : Headquarters 14th Infantry Brigade.One field Company R.E.Headquarters 52nd Light A.A. Regiment.One Heavy A.A. Battery.One Light A.A. Battery,and ancillary units.Yugoslavia.30. Mobilisation by personal notice has been proceeding since shortly afterthe Italian attack on Greece, and the five divisions closest to the Albanian and4 Officers. 141 O.Rs.2 Officers. 71 O.Rs.2 Officers. 87 O.Rs.1 Officer. 19 O.Rs.
Bulgarian frontiers are mobilised as well as duplicated. Certain other divisions,notably the 3rd Division (at Kragujevac), are also mobilising, and one at least(2nd Division at Belgrade) has begun duplication.Bulgaria.31. Whilst reports continue to be received of movements of supplies to thesouthern and south-eastern fronts, there is still no direct evidence that Bulgariacontemplates any offensive action against Greece or Turkey.Middle East.Egypt.32. There has been increased enemy activity but as yet no forward move isreported.Sudan.33. Gallabat was captured by the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade on the6th November. It was then lost again on the 7th November as the result of enemy air counter-attack, and partially recaptured on the 10th November. The actioncontinues.34. In the Kassala sector detachments of our troops have taken 262prisoners, our casualties being very slight.West Africa.35. Libreville surrendered to the Free French Forces on the 10th november and Port Gentil was occupied at 0830 hours on the 14th November.Far East.36. The 2nd reinforcing Brigade from India arrived in Malaya on the11th November.AIR SITUATION.General Review. ,37. Attacks on German industry and armaments have been maintainedwhenever weather conditions have permitted and, though on one night nooperations were possible and on another they were restricted to harassing attacks on French aerodromes by a few aircraft, the total number of night sorties has considerably increased. Low clouds, magnetic storms and severe icing conditions have been frequently encountered. Though operations against industrial targets in Northern Italy were projected on five nights during the week, only one attack was possible.The scale of attack on this country was slightly increased. For the first time Italian aircraft carried out a formation attack.In addition to the very successful Fleet Air Arm attack, Taranto was alsoeffectively bombed by Royal Air Force heavy bombers. Brindisi and ports inAlbania and Libya have also been attacked.Operational Aircraft Battle Casualties and Raid Assessment Reports are recorded in Appendices V and VI.German Territory.38. A total of 44 day and 489 night sorties (including eight against Italy)were flown by Bomber Command during the week, and 39 night bombing sorties were flown by Coastal Command.39. Oil plants, the iron and steel industry, communication targets and thesubmarine base at Lorient have been the principal primary objectives of our nightbombers. Essen and Munich suffered the heaviest single attacks of the week.Fifty tons of bombs were dropped on Krupps&apos; works on the night of the 7th/8th November, and the whole target area was effectively covered. The marshalling yards at Munich were attacked by thirty-one aircraft on the following night, andmany fires were started among buildings near the main station.40. The synthetic oil plants at Cologne and Gelsenkirchen suffered anumber of heavy attacks, one by sixteen Wellingtons on the latter resulting in
brilliant explosions and a series of fires visible for thirty miles. Similar plantsat Ruhland (North of Dresden), Hanover, Leuna, Bremen and Dortmund were also bombed, but on a lighter scale. On the night of the 10th/11th Novembertwo Hampdens reached Danzig, where bombs were dropped on a railway near the harbour.41. Rail and water communications have been primary targets on severalnights during the week, and particular attention was paid to the inland ports ofMannheim and Duisburg-Ruhrort, where large fires followed an attack by four aircraft on the night of the 12th/13th November. The Schlesischer Station andGrunewald Marshalling Yards in Berlin were attacked by five aircraft on thefollowing night. Among other industrial targets effectively bombed were theSiemens Schuckert factory at Nuremberg, blast furnaces in the Ruhr and power stations at Mannheim, Cologne and Dresden. The Channel ports have been attacked regularly and with satisfactory results, while at Lorient heavy damage is believed to have been caused by Coastal Command aircraft, which apparentlysecured hits with heavy bombs on workshops, in the dry dock and near thetorpedo-boat basin.42. Over fifty attacks have been made on aerodromes, and during a raidunder difficult weather conditions on that at Albert at least six enemy aircraft were set on fire and another was seen to crash on the aerodrome, apparently dueto fire from the ground defences. Leaflets were dropped in the Amiens and Parisdistricts on three nights during the week.43. Daylight operations were hampered by unfavourable weather and fewsorties were successful. Among the eight targets successfully attacked were a factory at Lorient, docks and barges at Boulogne and Calais and the aerodromes at St. Brieuc and Caen.Great Britain.44. During the week there was an increase in the scale of effort exerted bythe German Air Force against this country by day, 1,475 aircraft being employed as compared with 1,115 for the previous week, but there was a slight decrease by night, 870 compared with 930. Eleven of our aerodromes were attacked, butonly eight were hit as compared with thirteen during the previous week andtwenty-three the week before. Three Spitfires were destroyed and five damagedon the ground at Biggin Hill.45. By day the attacks have been directed mainly against our shipping,the Ju. 87 short-range dive-bombers being again employed. This type is nowonce more suffering very heavy casualties. On the 11th November ten bombers and about forty fighters of the Italian Air Force attempted to attack Harwich,thus making their first attack on this country in formation. Eight oftheir bombers and five of their fighters were shot down by our fighters. the bombers were twin-engined Fiat B.R. 20&apos;s and the fighters were Fiat C.R. 42&apos;s biplane aircraft of the Gladiator type, but with inferior armament. There havebeen only a few daylight penetrations into the London area.46. By night the main attacks have again been directed against Londonand the South-Eastern Counties. Attacks on a smaller scale have been made onthe Midlands and other areas. A noteworthy feature has been a tendency toreduce considerably the number of his attacks after midnight.47. Fighter Command has flown 192 night sorties during the week, and818 patrols, involving 4,047 aircraft, by day. Details of casualties are given inAppendix V.Coastal.48. Though there are no notable incidents to record this week, the routinework of Coastal Command has continued on normal lines, and the total of253 patrols, involving 401 sorties, and 123 convoy escorts marks a considerable increase over that of last week.49. Torpedo-carrying Beauforts on a roving patrol off the Dutch coast haveunsuccessfully attacked merchant shipping on four occasions, and bombs havebeen dropped on several aerodromes and on lock gates in the canal near
Amsterdam by aircraft in the course of routine patrols. Several engagements with hostile seaplanes have taken place without conclusive results, though damage was inflicted on six of them during the week, before they escaped into cloud.An He. Ill, when attacked and damaged by a Blenheim, was seen to jettison itsmine before escaping.50. German long-range reconnaissance aircraft have been active in the usualAtlantic and North Sea areas, and on one occasion have reached the east coast of Greenland from their base at Trondheim. Minelaying operations off our coastwere on a larger scale than in the previous week, 135 aircraft having been engaged, as compared with 65.Italy, Greece and Malta.51. The only attack on targets in Northern Italy was made on the night ofthe 8th-9th November, when eight Wclkakig effectively bombed the R.1.V ball-bearing factory and the Fiat works at Turin;and two others the Pirelli ElectricalWorks in Milan, fires being started in each case.52. On the 7th November six of our heavy and three medium bombers,operating from Eleusis in Greece, attacked the aerodrome at Valona in Albania,and inflicted considerable damage to eighteen bombers and thirty fighters andto one ship in the harbour. On the same day four heavy bombers successfully attacked the harbour, quays, shipping and railway terminus at Brindisi;numerous explosions occurred and a fire was started which was visible 40 miles away.53. On the 10th November, three Blenheims attacked the harbour atSarande, on the Albanian Coast, and jetties at Konispol Bay, on the- Greek-Albanian frontier. At Sarande, one bomb fell near a 7,000-ton vessel, whileother bombs damaged the docks. At Konispol Bay, one jetty was demolished and a road junction damaged. On the 11th our aircraft made highly successful attacks on Valona and Sordinori. At Valona hits were registered on a largebuilding in the aerodrome and on the docks. On the night of the llth-12th a heavy attack on Durazzo completely gutted and destroyed the fuel depot.54. In addition to the brilliant Fleet Air Arm attack on Taranto, whichhas been described in the Naval Situation, this port was heavily attacked by tenWellingtons on the night of the 13th-14th. Many heavy high-explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped in the inner harbour, on naval oil tanks and ondestroyer pens in the dockyard. Several bombs were seen to explode in the target area, including the pens where several destroyers were docked. At least elevenfires were started, one bright fire being followed by a big explosion. Anotherhuge explosion was seen to light up the town after the aircraft observing it hadflown for fifteen minutes from the target55. Italian air operations appear to have been directed almost entirelyagainst Greek troop concentrations and positions. Extensive dive-bombing and machine-gun attacks were carried out by the Italians in the forward zone.Kastoria was bombed eleven times on the 5th November. Corfu and Crete havebeen attacked, but no details are available and there continues to be a dearth of definite information on the results of the extensive attacks which the Italianscarried out in the first week of the campaign. Reports which have been received of heavy damage and casualties at Corfu and Salonica and of serious effect on civilian morale are so far unconfirmed.56. Italian aircraft co-operated with their Alpine detachments, whichpushed through the gap between the Pindus and Epirus sectors, reachingDystraton, by dropping supplies. Their support does not seem to have been very effective as this detachment has in the main been cut off by the Greeks, the remnants being in full retreat via Koritza. The Greek Air Force is said to befighting extremely well and morale is high.57. Several reconnaissances of the Gulf and harbour of Taranto were carried out from Malta during the week. On the 10th November two italian aircraft machine-gunned Hal Far aerodrome, and damaged one Swordfish on theground. On the 12th our fighters intercepted six Italian aircraft whichattempted to cross the Island and shot one of them down.[21922] D
Egypt and Libya.57a, On the 8th November nineteen Blenheims secured several direct hits onbarracks at Derna and Tobruk and shipping at Benghazi, and the hangars atBerca were successfully attacked on the following night. At Berca, two enemy bombers were destroyed and other aircraft and buildings damaged. On the12th several motor vehicles were damaged in an attack on Sidi Barrani.58. On the 10th November an enemy aircraft carried out a longreconnaissance of the Suez Canal and dropped ten bombs near Deversoir, but no damage is reported. On the night of the 11th/12th November the enemy droppeda few bombs on Aboukir, Helwan and Suez. The lighthouse and the government buildings at Suez were set on fire. Alexandria was bombed on the following night and two warehouses were slightly damaged.Sudan and East Africa.59. Three attacks were made by our aircraft during the week on harbours and shipping. The naval base at Massawa was attacked on the 9th and again on the 11th November. Considerable damage was done to warehouses on thequay. Bahar Dar on the Red Sea was bombed on the night of the 11th/12thand two large fires were started at the wharves. The enemy camp at Keren was attacked twice by our Blenheims and much damage was caused. The railway station at Agordat, the petrol dump at Zula and the wireless transmitter station at Dohul Island were also successfully attacked. On the 12th November aWellesley destroyed an enemy seaplane in Zula by machine-gun fire.Air Intelligence.Italy.60. The morale of the Italian Air Force prisoners captured both in Englandand Greece appears to be low. They lack determination and readily give informa-tion. Those taken at Salonika had had only a few months&apos; training and verylittle flying experience.61. The use of Greek markings by Italian aircraft has now been definitely established.62. Reports from numerous sources indicate that the inhabitants of Romeare suffering badly from nerves and enduring much discomfort in anticipation of British bombing attacks. The despatch of the Italian Air Force contingent to co-operate with the Germans in attacks on England is apparently veryunpopular, owing to the obvious possibility of reprisals.63. On the 8th November an S. 82 landed intact in Cyprus, the crew of foursurrendering. The aircraft apparently lost its way while en route from italy to the Dodecanese with a load of aero-engine lubricating oil. Apart from theinterest attaching to the capture of an aircraft about which little is known, itscargo may well point to a shortage of lubricants, especially as it should be a veryeasy matter to store sufficient lubricants for a long period.Japan.64. The scale of Japanese air operations in China has fallen to a low leveland no satisfactory explanation is apparent. \Russia.65. It has been suggested that one of the objects of the German invitation to Molotov was the exploration of the possibility of developing the russian aircraft and engine factories in order to secure additional supplies to Germany.Additional Russian productive capacity, however, may not be very great and improvement could only come under German instructors and technical experts.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.66. The force and extent of enemy air activity is summarised under air situation.Damage.Aircraft Factories.67.   No aircraft factory has sustained any damage during this period.Public Utilities.68. Gas works were the chief sufferers among utility services. In London,three works of the Gas Light and Coke Company, Limited, were hit: at theUnion Street, Stratford, works a gas holder was put out of commission and 5 sets of retorts damaged; at the Beckton works, the railway and mains systems were damaged; at the Brentford works, damage was very slight.69. Outside London, at the Walsall Corporation^ Gas Works, a gas holderwas set on fire and though the fire was extinguished in about three hours anU.X.B. remains inside the holder; production of gas on a limited scale was resumed in about twenty-four hours, but full production is dependent on theremoval of this U.X.B.70. Two electricity power stations were damaged. Deptford Westsustained three direct hits, and a portion of the switch-gear was demolished,putting the whole station out of action; supplies, however, were maintained.The damage was similar at Broomgrove, Hastings; here also alternative supplies were obtained. Apart from damage to power stations, there have been occasionalinterruptions of local supply in various parts of the country, none of which are serious.71. As a result of damage to the L.C.C. Pumping Station at Hammersmith,there has been a considerable risk of flooding in parts of Hammersmith andKensington in the event of heavy rainfall.Telephone and Wireless communications.72. No major damage was done to telephone exchanges during the week,but three exchanges previously damaged in London are still substantially out ofaction.73. The Ongar Wireless Station, North Weald, was hit on the 8th Novemberbut services were not interrupted.Industry.74. The number of hits on industrial premises was slightly higher thanin the previous period under review.75. Severe damage was done to Projectile and Engineering Company, Ltd.,S.W. 8 (making oxygen cylinders), where extensive damage to buildings was done and production has temporarily ceased. Substantial damage occurred atthe following factories : (a) Metal Box Company, Limited, Chequers Works, N. 13. (Metalcontainers.) Coal gas supply cut off by enemy action; productioncurtailed by 50 per cent.(&amp;) Vickers Armstrong Limited, Powder Mill Lane, Dartford. (Guns, tanks,ammunition.)   U.X.B. caused work to stop for three days.(c) Steel Barrel Company, Limited, Phoenix Wharf, Uxbridge.     (Mobilepetrol tanks.)  Production partially stopped for eight days.(d) Baker Platinum Company, Limited, Vauxhall Street, S.E. 11.   (Non-ferrous metals.) Production down by 50 per cent, owing to watershortage in the district.(e) Venesta Limited, North Woolwich Road, E. 16.    (Plywood.)    TubeDepartment closed down; no report as to date of resumption.
(/) S. Smith and Sons (M.A.) Limited, Waterloo Road, Cricklewood, N.W. 2.(Instruments, Car Accessories.) Hit by HE. and U.X.B. Productiontemporarily at a standstill.76. Considerably more hits were registered on the railway system than lastweek, the total being 92, of which 74 were in the London area. The whole of theincrease was in the London area, the number of hits elsewhere remaining at 18.Five of the London termini were affected at various times by fresh damage. Inthe great majority of cases, however, damage was very slight and the trackscleared in a few hours.77. A serious incident was caused at Sloane Square Underground Stationwhen H.E. demolished the Booking Hall and hit the rear part of a train. the casulties are so far known to be 35 killed and 40 injured; a further 15 bodiesmay be recovered. While the station cannot be opened for some time, it is hoped the track will be cleared quickly.Other Damage.78. Damage to public buildings has been slight. The Art Block of theCivic Centre of Southampton was hit and the Council Offices at Ramsgatedamaged. A considerable number of hospitals were hit, but severe casualties have not resulted. The Military Hospital at Pembroke Dock was practicallydemolished, and a temporary military hospital at Leyton was badly damaged by fire. Extensive damage was also done to the Highgate Hospital, to Queen Mary&apos;hospital at Sidcup and to the Evelina Hospital, Southwark. Schools were hitat West Ham, Ascot and Redbourne (Herts.).79. Civil Defence premises have been hit on several occasions during theweek; the most serious incident was on the night of the 6th/7th, when theWandsworth A.F.S. Station was totally destroyed and 13 people were killed.Damage was also done to A.F.S. Stations at Erith and East Ham, to Depots atLewisham, Poplar, Merton, Uxbridge and Beddington, and to a First Aid Postat Hammersmith.80. Damage to house property has continued throughout the London area,involving a large number of boroughs. The brunt has fallen this week on Eastand West Ham, Lambeth and Wandsworth. In the rest of the country damageof this kind has been widespread. Several shelter incidents have been reported,all from the London area. The most serious was at Lambeth on the night of the12th/13th, when a public shelter was hit; a total of 19 people killed and50 seriously injured has so far been reported; 7 were killed and 50 seriously injured at the Granada Cinema nearby at the same time.Civilian Casualties.81. The approximate figures for the week ending 0600 hours, 13thNovember, were 842 killed and 1,810 injured, of which London suffered 687 killed and 1,382 injured. In the provinces the areas that received the greater numberof casualties were :  Unexploded Bombs.82. The number of U.X.B.&apos;s dropped during the week was 1,164 ascompared with 597 during last week. The total remaining for disposal is now3,069, a very large proportion in places where they are of no account.Morale and Civil Defence Operations.83.   The morale of the country as a whole remains unchanged.The full-time reinforcements for the Birmingham Fire Services have been withdrawn, but some 260 part-time volunteers from other districts remain undera scheme for training.Railways.SwanscombeSouthamptonPortsmouthBirminghamKilled.262399Injured.10403331

It is the Potsdamer Station on the Ring Line and not thePotsdamer Station of the Stadtbahn that has been hit. The Ring Line can be compared to the Inner Circle in London. A bomb near the Savigny Platz affectedWestbound traffic on the Stadtbahn and a brewery facing the Innsbruck Platzwas burnt out. A viaduct at the Lehrter Station has been severely damaged andthe subway in the Stettiner Station was hit, with severe casualties. DeutscheWaffen- und Munitonsfabriken of Charlottenburg have closed down and started work at Posen. This step is believed to have been taken as a result of damage to the works. The plant of Siemens &amp; Halske manufacturing low current equip-ment for wireless, telephones, medical appliances and the like has been seriously damaged and a munition depot near the Funkturm was hit. A timber works hasbeen fired and the damage is estimated at over seven million marks. Althoughraids on Berlin have become fewer in number, their increase in intensity hasresulted in more material damage and moral effect than heretofore.Mannheim. Alterbenz (Motoren) Werke, manufacturers of petrol motors,have failed to deliver, it is believed as a result of air raid damage to the works.A locomotive shed containing eight engines has been badly damaged and the line from Mannheim to Ludwigshafen was affected for a period. The station hasbeen damaged.Dusseldorf.Rheinische Metallwaaren has been hit and badly damaged.Unna.-Stahlwerk Unna Muller has been badly damaged. Some time islikely to elapse before normal production can be resumed.Cologne. The new bridge across the Rhine at Muehlheim has been damaged,but is now repaired. Damage is said to be heavy at Leverkusen and at Knapsack,1\ miles south-west of Cologne.Hamburg. The oil port has been burnt out.Bremerhafen. In the middle of October two ships loaded with iron and steel products sank  IS cl result of air attack.Meiderich. The railway station has been hit and seriously damaged.Mining. Reports have on occasion been received of difficulties in passing through the Kiel Canal. These reports in each case have been considered of doubtful reliability, but a further report from a source who, though not proved to be reliable may well be so, states that his ship of about 2,500 tons took a week to sail from Bremen to Aarhus owing to ships having been sunk in the Kiel Canal.The cumulative effect of these reports is such that the successful results of miningin the Kiel Canal may be accepted, although no particulars are available.A grain elevator has been hit and burnt out, and Rheinmetall
The ferry between Helsingborg and Elsinore was mined early in Novemberoff Elsinore, but was not badly damaged. The Swedes have exploded two mines in the Helsingborg Channel.Czechoslovakia.The munitions depot of the Skoda branch factory at Holysov, near Stankov,has been destroyed. This branch was accommodated in the building of a formerglass works on the Piisen-Taus railway line.Holland.In a raid on Deventer aerodrome five aircraft and a building were destroyed.Italy.It is reported that during a recent attack on Turin 92 railway waggons were destroyed in the goods yards.The raid on Maritza aerodrome (Rhodes) on the 17th/18th October causednumerous casualties and considerable damage to hangars and aircraft.
