fHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1940.SECRET. Copy No.- \W.P. (*0) 427. *October 27, 1940.TO BE KEPT^UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SECOND REPORT ON THE MINISTRY OE AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.(Previous Report W.P. (40) 211.)Memorandum, by the Minister of Aircraft Production.DURING the last three months a series of misfortunes has befallen this ministry, as an inevitable consequence of the fact that its factories are a high-priority target for enemy bombing.While many factories engaged on contracts for the Ministry have sufferedrhrough enemy bombing, there have been the following major disasters to mainaircraft and engine works :  -August 14: Castle Bromwich. Here the bombing had a limited effecton the production of Spitfires.August 15 : Shorts, Rochester. As a result of this attack we have lostthree months&apos; output of Stirling bombers, and the plant, which has been abandoned.September 4 : Vickers, Weybridge. We must expect a loss of one hundred and twenty-five Wellington bombers. The plant is disrupted, and,almost evacuated.September 24 : Supermarine, Southampton. We lost two out of thethree plants at these Works. The final effect on output of the disaster willprobably be a loss of six weeks&apos; Spitfires.September 25 : Bristol. This was another heavy blow. We lost theRodney works, with complete stoppage of engine output for one week.*The effect on airframe production at the plant represents a loss of two orthree weeks&apos; output of Beauforts and Beaufighters.October 3 : Hawker, Kingston. Here the attacks have not yet been reflected in production. The loss may be estimated provisionally at fiftyHurricanes.October 4: De Havillands. We lost just over a week&apos;s output ofOxford aircraft.These disasters had a very considerable effect on production in September.We lost 300 machines, as compared with the August output.But it must not be assumed that the bombing of factories was the soleexplanation of the decline in output. A more serious factor was the loss ofworking time, due to the air raid warning system. Some factories lost half theirworking hours owing to time spent in the shelters.In spite of these damaging influences, we have been able to sustain a dignifiedlevel of production.* Normal production will be delayed for several weeks.[21853]
Here is our balance sheet: We have 780 more aircraft of the six principal operational types(Hurricane, Spitfire, Blenheim, Wellington, Whitley and Hampden) than we hadon the lOtJh May.On the 15th May, there were 88  bomber and fighter squadrons. On the25th October there were 107^ squadrons.On the 15th May there were 884 machines available in those squadrons. Thereare now (the 25th October) 1,222.We have in hand (the 26th October) in the Aircraft Storage Units, 911aircraft of operational types &quot; Ready,&quot;* compared with 59 aircraft on the15th May.During the period the 15th May-24th October, there have been 2,731casualties, in categories three and two, to Hurricanes and Spitfires alone.The Training Command are entirely supplied with aircraft. They have allthat they need for their purposes.   Indeed, they have a surplus.Twenty-nine non-operational aircraft, nearly all of training types, were ready for service in the Storage Units when the Churchill Government was formed.Now there are 730 of these same types.Over this period of five months, engines on hand have been increased by1,259 units, thus strengthening our reserves.During these five months of violent life at home 1,164 aircraft have been shipped overseas, and these aircraft have carried with them 1,720 engines.Deliveries of aircraft from the United States are disappointing in scale and limited in their value for purposes of combat.The losses of American aircraft during transit to this country have beenmany.There is a tendency among our people to rely more and more on Americanoutput of aircraft.   That would be a mistake.On the contrary, the American situation shows the need for increasing ourproductive effort here.   This is the true lesson which it has for us.A scheme of dispersal was launched last May in order to reduce, if possible,the damage to aircraft and allied production through enemy attack.This scheme takes the form of splitting up the main factories in vunerable areas into a number of separate premises, geographically convenient to one another.The system of dispersal damages production, but it improves the prospect of security.On the airframe and engine production side, 364 new premises have been acquired.This immense dislocation has caused a certain amount of difficulty. It ha.saroused, naturally enough, a considerable measure of criticism among those whohave been displaced.   But it had to be done.Many Government Departments have been asked to release premises. A mostgenerous response has been accorded us by the Ministries.In addition, instrument production has been dispersed in part. So, too, hasradio manufacture.It is not intended to convey the impression that the dispersal process has gone as far as may be necessary. In fact, many new schemes are in operation,and other projects are contemplated.But it has been an immense task, and I must give high praise to my colleagues of the Dispersal Groups for the energy and imagination they have shown.Yet these precautions and the further measures we are planning still leave us at the mercy of enemy attack, if there is any increase in the scale or intensity of his bombing operations.The Aircraft Industry has borne its grievous blows with fortitude andequanimity, but it is conceivable that, if the attack is delivered more viciously,we will have more to suffer and a degree of endurance to display greater than allthat has gone before.B.Ministry of Aircraft Production,October 27, 1940.* Ready and ready in four days.
