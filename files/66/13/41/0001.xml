Generally speaking the &quot;best way which we can assistthe Yugoslavs is to carry on the war relentlessly ourselvesagainst the Germans and Italians.     The form and scale ofmore direct armed assistance may be summarised as follows.3. Navy Assistance.      Our Naval forces, &quot;by controllingsea communications in Greek waters, and the Aegean, mightbe able to keep open the supply line through Salonika,which is so important to Yugoslavia.     This would dependon the situation in Bulgaria and the attitude of Turkey,as enemy forces operating with free use of Bulgarianterritory could make Salonika unusable as a supply base,unless it could be adequately defended by fighter aircraft and A.A. guns.     The provision of air defences forSalonika would not be possible at an early date in viewof our other commitments in the Eastern Mediterranean.4. Sustained operations in the Adriatic, on a scalesufficient to interrupt Italian communications and tosecure those of Yugoslavia are not possible, though submarineoperations might be undertaken. \5. Air Assistance.     Any air assistance which we giveYugoslavia against the Germans can only be at the expenseof our air assistance to Greece against the Italians andoan only be effective over the southern part of Yugoslavia.6. Army Assistance.      It is not possible for us toassist Yugoslavia with land forces.(Signed)    DUDLEY POUND,CP.A. PORTAL,R.H. HAINING.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.,24th November, 1940.
