THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECEET.W.P. (40) 455.November 20, 1940.TO BE.....KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special car-e may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.COASTAL COMMAND.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE Admiralty have studied the paper of the Minister of aircraft production with regard to the formation of a Naval Air Force which is to includethe present Coastal Command of the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm.The arguments he brings forward for the formation of such a force are all wellknown and have been stated by the Admiralty. We concur in them to-day and asindicated by the 1st Sea Lord at the meeting of Defence Committee on the5th November, 1940 (D.O. (40) 40th Meeting), the Admiralty have always beenin favour of having full control, not only of Coastal Command, but of all aircraftwhose normal function is to fly over the sea.2. If the War Cabinet decides that this change in the organisation andcontrol of all aircraft operating over the sea could be established in war time without undue dislocation and therefore without a period of reduced efficiency,the Admiralty would be strongly in favour of the change. The paper which Isubmitted on the 4th November, 1940 (W.P. (40) 434), was based on the fact thatthe need for expanding the air service operating over the sea was so urgent thatit was most important to get a rapid expansion now.3. The position now is that the Air Ministry have recognised the immediateneed referred to above and have promised (a) To deliver to Coastal Command, as early as possible 1 Beaufort Squadron.1 Blenheim (F) Squadron (formed from 2 additional flights).1 Beaufighter Squadron.1 Wellington Squadron.and also to increase 4 existing long range fighter squadrons from 16to 20.(b) By June 1941, to increase the strength of Coastal  Command by15 Squadrons, including those in paragraph (a).(out of the 100 additional squadrons which is the generalexpansion target of the R.A.F.).If these proposals are rapidly implemented, the position will be much improved.4. The Admiralty are most anxious to help in any way which would getthe aircraft mentioned in paragraph 3 into the air at an earlier date, and have indicated to the Air Ministry that they would be willing to provide some of the[21939]Copy No.
personnel required for these Squadrons. This would be done by re-equipping two squadrons of T.S.R.&apos;s now based on Hatstone and delaying the formation of spare Squadrons of Fulmars and T.S.R.&apos;s for the Mediterranean. It should be understood that this action would achieve the purpose of expediting the trainingof the pilots in Blenheims and Beaufighters and thus get the aircraft into service at an earlier date. Thereafter the personnel so provided will be used forSquadrons additional to the fifteen to be supplied and manned by the R.A.F.5. We consider, however, that the question of the Admiralty taking overthe control of all aircraft operating over the sea is one which would requireexamination and that the War Cabinet should be in possession of the results ofthis examination before giving their decision. The only way in which this couldbe done successfully would be to appoint a Committee including technical advisersrepresenting both the Air Ministry and the Admiralty to report on the steps tobe taken. Such a course would involve no waste of time since, even if the Cabinetgave a decision to-day, it would be necessary before the turnover could commenceto decide how this could be done and to draw up a programme.6. The Admiralty would stress that the volume of air attack on our tradeis likely to increase rather than decrease owing to the additional bases and long-range aircraft available to the enemy and a still further expansion will benecessary. If the R.A.F. is unable to provide more than the fifteen Squadronsalready promised, there are two ways in which the Navy could assist: (a) by providing additional men for training by the R.A.F. for extra shore-based, squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm; or(&amp;) by the Admiralty proceeding to form at the earliest possible momentadditional Squadrons which they would train in; all respects them-selves, but which would require at the outset additional aerodromes,instructional officers and skilled staffs.If alternative (&amp;). were adopted, it would no doubt be slower in producingadditional Squadrons because of the time involved in providing new aerodromes and organising new instructional and maintenance staffs and facilities.A.
