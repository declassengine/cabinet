General Review.In the English Channel naval forces have bombarded invasion ports and as weep by light craft destroyed enemy patrols.Destroyers sank an enemy convoy off the Norwegian Coast.In the Mediterranean contact between light forces resulted in the sinking of three Italian destroyers.The loss of merchant tonnage, whilst still considerable, is again below the weekly average for the past three months.Home Waters.2. A force consisting of H.M.S. Revenge, cruisers, destroyers and motortorpedo boats, working in conjunction with heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force,bombarded the port of Cherbourg on the night of the lOth-llth October. Theco-ordination of the attack was excellent, the lighting of fires in the target area and the illumination of Cape de la Hague by flares for fixing purposes occurringat exactly the right moment. One hundred and twenty rounds of 15-inch and800 rounds of 4-7-inch shell were fired and very heavy fires were started. Itwould appear that the shore defences at first mistook the bombardment for partof the air attack as the only response to shells falling was a marked intensifica-tion of anti-aircraft fire, including flaming onions and multi-coloured tracers ofall descriptions. After the bombardment had ceased a battery of heavy guns(estimated up to 13-5-inch) to the east of the town opened fire. Salvoes fellclose to the ships for a period of 30 minutes and up to a range of about 36,000yards. The fire was so accurate that it was thought that some form of R.D.E.was used for ranging.   No casualties or damage were sustained by H.M. Ships.3. On the night of the llth-12th October motor torpedo boats torpedoed and sank two enemy trawlers off the Belgian Coast and took 34 prisoners. no account of this incident was given to the Press as it is possible that the germans will ascribe the loss of these ships to mines.On the same night two of H.M. Trawlers Listrae and Warwick Deepingwere sunk by enemy light craft off St. Catherines. There were 24 survivors fromthe former and the majority of the Warwick Deeping&apos;s crew landed in the Isle of wight. Two French chasseurs with British crews on patrol in this area arealso missing and it is feared that they have been sunk. There is evidence thatthe enemy force consisted of a destroyer and 3 or 4 torpedo boats or E-boats.Destroyer patrols were ordered to intercept the enemy and early on the12th October H.M.S. Jackal sighted and engaged two small craft 30 miles north of Cherbourg but the enemy were soon lost in the darkness.4. About noon on the 15th October six large enemy motor torpedo boats were sighted 9 miles off Dover proceeding to the Westward. They were engagedby the shore batteries, but were not hit.On the night of the 15th-16th October, H.M.S. Erebus bombarded Dunkirk.She fired 50 rounds of 15-inch, 45 of which were estimated to fall in the target area. Spotting conditions were good and a flare-dropping aircraft drew theground defence fire so that the spotting aircraft was undisturbed. Fires were observed on the quays.   There was no enemy action against our ships.5. There have been several casualties and cases of damage to destroyers and small craft from mines; H.M. Patrol craft Girl Mary was sunk in the Firthof Forth on the 10th October, two of the crew were lost and the Skipper was seriously wounded. On the llth October H.M. Patrol Yacht Aisha was sunkwith two wounded, and ELM.S. Jersey was damaged in the Thames Estuary.H.M.S. Zxdu was also slightly damaged on the same day by an explosion in the firth of Forth. ELM. Trawler Resolvo was damaged off Sheerness on the12th October and had to be beached, two of her crew were slightly wounded. Onthe 15th October ELM. Drifter Summer Rose was sunk off Sunderland with theloss of two of the crew and H.M. Examination Vessel Danube III was sunk offSheerness, ELM. Yacht Janetha IV was damaged by two other explosions whilsttrying to rescue survivors.  H.M. Trawler Lord Stamp is missing and is believed
to have been sunk by a mine south-west of Portland Bill on the 14th October.H.M. Kiver Patrol Vessel Mistletoe was sunk in the Humber on the 15th October.There were two survivors of a crew of six. On the 16th October Motor torpedo boat 106 was sunk in the Thames Estuary, one rating was injured.ELM. Armed Merchant Cruiser Cheshire was torpedoed by a submarineabout 160 miles west of the Bloody Foreland on the evening of the 14th October,she was towed to Belfast, where she arrived on the 17th October.Norway.6. Four destroyers operating against enemy shipping off the norwegian coast on the night of the 13th-14th October sank a small convoy of 3 merchant ships and 2 escorting vessels. One of the merchant ships was estimated to be ,000 tons and the other two about 2,500 tons. The escorts were a motor torpedo boat and a trawler.Mediterranean.7. The Fleet, which had sailed from Alexandria on the 8th October,encountered little air activity during its passage to the westward. There was apparently a concentration of submarines about 200 miles north of Benghazi andit is possible that a submarine attacked H.M.S. Malaya south-east of Crete on the9th October. A convoy of 4 ships, for which the Fleet was providing cover,entered Malta on the 11th October, and several units of the Fleet went in andrefuelled.H.M. Destroyer Imperial struck a mine and has been docked at Malta. Onerating was killed and one seriously wounded. Weather was bad whilst ships wererefuelling, and no enemy air attacks were made.8. A small convoy for Alexandria left Malta on the evening of the11th October, and to cover them cruisers searched to the north and east. H.M.S.Ajax encountered three destroyers early on the 12th October and sank two of theArione class (679 tons, built 1937-38). Later she sighted a large cruiser and four destroyers, one of which she damaged before the ships escaped in the darkness.At dawn air reconnaissance located the damaged destroyer in tow of anotherone, but nO other ships were seen. The towing destroyer, on the approach of our forces, at once slipped her tow and escaped under cover of smoke, and the crew ofthe damaged destroyer, the Artigliere (1,620 tons, completed 1937), abandonedship.H.M.S. York dropped Carley floats in the vicinity for the use of survivorsand sank the Artigliere by torpedo. In view of the fact that the ships were insubmarine waters about 90 miles south-east of Sicily, and the previous experienceof H.M. Ships being bombed whilst picking up the survivors of the BartolomeoColleoni, it was not considered advisable to stop and pick up the survivors. Afew survivors were, however, rescued some distance away by H.M. Ships Nubianand Vampire. Casualties in H.M.S. Ajaa were 2 officers and 10 ratings killed,and 1 officer and 2 ratings seriously wounded.   She suffered slight damage.9. The Fleet was unsuccessfully attacked by about 50 aircraft during the afternoon of the 12th October. Three enemy aircraft were destroyed by fighters and one by A.A. fire and two others were damaged.On the night of the 13th-14th October aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm attackedPort Lago in the Dodecanese. Barracks, workshops, hangars and a petrol tankwere hit and set on fire.   All our aircraft returned safely.On the afternoon of the 14th October the Battle Fleet was again unsuccess-fully bombed. In the evening torpedo aircraft attacked without result, andone of them was believed to have been shot down. At this time torpedo aircraftalso attacked the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and hit H.M.S. Liverpool, killing 3 officersand 10 ratings and wounding 40. Liverpool was taken in tow and arrived at alexandria on the 16th October. Three enemy cruisers and three destroyers were sighted by aircraft to the north-east of Malta on the 16th October, but the aircraftlost contact and nothing further was seen of them.10.   Belated reports now show that H.M. Submarine Osiris sank a transportof some 3,000 tons in the Straits of Oranto on the 15th August.  H.M. SubmarineTruant sank a merchant ship of approximately the same size off Naples on the[20835] B
25th September and JBLM. Submarine Pandora sank a ship of about 800 tonsoff Benghazi oh the 28th September.West Africa.11. The French cruiser Primauguet was reported to have left Casablancaon the 10th October escorting a merchant vessel with ammunition for naval units at Dakar. Strong forces were ordered to locate and shadow her, but she was notsighted.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. During the period seven attacks were carried out on U-boats, four byELM. Ships Chelsea, Leith, Folkestone and Scarborough and three by aircraft.LeiWs (attack was by gunfire and later by depth charges. Scarborough and an aircraft attacked the same U-boat approximately 180 miles North-West of Rockallon the 17th October. None of these attacks have, as yet, been assessed as definitelysuccessful. Four of them took place in the North-West Approaches, and threein the Channel Approaches. In addition, H.M.S. Trident attacked a 500-tonU-boat off Lorient on the 8th October and believed that she damaged and possiblysunk it.In the Mediterranean an aircraft unsuccessfully attacked a submarine 250miles north of Benghazi on the 10th October, and later on the same day aircraftco-operating with H.M.A.S. Vampire almost certainly damaged a submarine50 miles south of this position.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.13. During the period seven ships (33,855 tons) have been reported sunk.Of these four British (24,861 tons), one Norwegian (4,624 tons), and one Greek(3,687 tons) were sunk by submarine. One Trinity House vessel was mined. Inaddition, news has been received of the loss of one Greek ship (5,867 tons) byraider in September, and three ships, one British (840 tons), one Norwegian(5,811 tons) and a Greek (3,816 tons), previously reported damaged, are now knownto be sunk.Damage either by aircraft, mine or submarine, to eight British ships (44,194tons) has been reported.Details are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week 888 ships, including 164 allied and 40 neutral, havebeen convoyed and 5 of them have been sunk. These figures do not include certainconvoys in the Mediterranean, the figures for which are not available. two cruisers, one anti-aircraft cruiser, one anti-aircraft ship, ten armed merchant cruisers, 36 destroyers and 44 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duty.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy for the second week in succession exceeded a million tons, the amount being 1,006,288 tons, comparedwith 1,106.737 tons for the previous seven days, and 950,082 tons, the average forthe previous ten weeks. Fifteen tankers brought 162,539 tons of oil of variousgrades. Mineral imports were 338,955 tons, of which 260,301 tons were steel,scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Timber and wood pulp imports were 105,888tons, and cereals were 176,567 tons, fifteen ships being fully laden with grainand flour. Other food imports totalled 78,984 tons, of which 35,935 tons weresugar.Enemy Intelligence.German.15. Air reconnaissance at Kiel on the 15th October showed the Scharnhorst,-Gneisenau and Lutzow still in dock. The 6-inch cruisers Koln and Leipzig werelying at buoys in the stream. One minelaying cruiser was fitting out and another was complete. Earlier reconnaissance of Wilhelmshaven showed that the newbattleship Tirpitz had been moved from the floating dock, and it is thought thatthis may possibly be a result of the air attacks on the 8th and the 9th October.
Naval units in German occupied ports seem to be disposed as follows : destroyers and T.Bs. at Brest and Cherbourg, submarines at Lorient, and E-boats and patrolships at any suitable port, though concentrations of these smaller ships have been observed at Havre and Boulogne during the week. Some of the submarines knownto be iat Bordeaux are believed to be Italian. There is no important change inthe disposition of barges and merchant shipping. The German submarines oon-tinue to be disposed with two or even three far out between 180 and 22&quot; West andtwo or more others spaced at intervals nearer in to the North-Western Approaches.On occasions these have been noted as following particular convoys. Onesubmarine has been reported working as far south as 45&quot; N. in a longitude W. of15&quot; for the last three days.Information received during the week has confirmed the opinion that thereare four enemy raiders at large. One is probably in the South Pacific and TasmanSea, one in the Indian Ocean, one in the Atlantic in the vicinity of the Equatorand one in the North Atlantic.Italian.16. A series of air reconnaissances of Italian naval ports during the period under review have shown that the main force of the Italian Fleet is still concen-trated at Taranto and a further small force of cruisers and destroyers at Brindisi.On the 13th October the Taranto forces were reported as : Outer Harbour 3 or battleships, 10 or 8 cruisers and a large number of small craft; Inner Flarbour 3 cruisers, 6 or more destroyers and small craft. In addition to these concentra-.tions small forces of destroyers have been observed in the Ionian Sea off the coast of Sicily and in Benghazi. Two Italian submarines are still believed to be working between Spain and the Azores, but there is no recent news of them.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.17. It has been reported that six ships have received orders to get readyto sail from Vigo, and their destination is believed to be Bilbao. Crews for these ships are said to have been made up from the other two ships in the port.The Norwegian whale factory ship C.A. Larsen (13,246 tons) was reportedto be at Trondhjem on the 8th October.The Annaliese Essberger (5,173 tons) and the Kulmerland (7,363 tons) are believed to have sailed from Kobe on the 9th October and the Scharnhorst, in thesame port, is reported to have loaded to capacity with oil fuel. The Eisenach(4,423 tons), which is at Punta Arenas, Costa Rica, was reported to be sailingon the 12th October with only three days&apos; coal bunkers aboard, but she has beenheld up for coal. A small quantity is available at Manzanillo if ten days&apos; notice is given.It has been reported that the Cerigo (1,120 tons) is likely to sail fromGuayaquil, Ecuador, shortly for Japan. She will fly the Japanese flag whenoutside territorial waters. She may, however, have difficulty in obtaining a supply of coal. The Klaxiis Schoke (5,848 tons), at Horta in the Azores, hasrecently taken 100 tons of coal from the Luise Bornhofen, is reported to beanchored eastward of the middle breakwater and it is likely that she will sail.The Luise Bornhofen (2,860 tons) is also anchored very close to the breakwater.The tanker Geolania (8,923 tons) sailed from Las Palrnas in the early hours ofthe 15th October. She had a cargo of 9,000 tons of whale oil also fuel oil which she had taken from another German tanker.Italian.18. The Franca Fassio (1,858 tons) is reported to have been torpedoed and sunk off Savona in the Gulf of Genoa with the loss of nearly all on board,including eighteen passengers, four of whom were Spanish. She had been plyingregularly between Genoa and Barcelona.The Antonietia Costa (5,900 tons) reported on, the 9th October that shewas being attacked by a submarine in a position to the West of Durazzo.
British Minelaying.19. H.M.S. Teviot Bank and H.M.S. Plover laid 340 mines in the east coast Barrier on the 12th October and the former laid a further 260 in the same area three days later. On the 12th October H.M.S. Southern Prince laid 99 deepmines off the West Coast of Scotland. Minelaying by aircraft has been continued by both Bomber and Coastal Commands in the Baltic and off the North-WesternCoasts of Germany and France.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping. -20. Ten out of the twelve casualties this week are attributed to the acousticmine, and in six of these cases the ships were sunk, one other having to be beached.ELM. Ships have detonated nine acoustic mines at varying distances and haveeither suffered very slight damage or none at all. The Thames Estuary,particularly in the Barrow Deep Channel, appears to be the area in which mostmines are being laid. Other areas where casualties have occurred, supposedlydue to acoustic mines, are in the Firth of Forth, the Humber and off Sunderland.One mine, thought to be of this type, was exploded in the war Channel north-east of Scarborough.Independent observers from different ships report that enemy aircraft,thought to be laying acoustic mines, cut off their engines before releasing the mines. On the occasions when mines have exploded in the air the explosion ha,scorresponded with the starting up again of the engine. More reports have beenreceived of acoustic mines being detonated by fast ships after several slow ships have passed without causing an explosion.The results of LL sweeping operations indicate that magnetic minesare again being laid off the East Coast harbours and in the Estuaries. magnetic mines were dropped in the Thames during the night of the 15th-16th october and traffic was suspended between Lambeth Bridge and the West India Dock.Within twenty-four hours these mines, with one exception, had been explodedand traffic was resumed with instructions as to the locality of the remainingmine. Following the report of a magnetic mine being seen to drop on the northside of the River, south-east of Southend, on the 13th October a small dangerousarea was declared; a skid towing drifter picked up a parachute in the tow andan attempt will be made to recover this mine.21. Attempts are still being made to clear the proposed searched channelat Falmouth, but operations have been hampered by bad weather and also because a number of sweeps have been cut. Both mines and sweeps have been cut in water previously thoroughly swept. Eleven mines have been cut orexploded in this area during the week.The dangerous area off Dover was enlarged on the 13th October as mines hadbeen swept outside the limit of the original area. Sweeping continues daily andnineteen mines have been accounted for this week, though several sweeps have been cut.   Ships are being swept through the searched channels.It appears to be certain that E-boats have again laid mines in the Harwicharea. Fast sweepers are sweeping ahead of both the north and south-bound convoys, and during the week nine mines have been cut or exploded in sweeps inthe vicinity of the searched channel.Following the loss of. an A/S Trawler on the 14th October seventeen miles south-west of Portland, a large dangerous area has been declared, as a contactminefield is suspected.  Other casualties had previously occurred in this area.The mine totals up to the 16th October are : Magnetic 697 (excluding those on land and those between Lambeth Bridge and the East India Dock); contact 610;acoustic 31.Japan.22. Eight out of the total of ten Japanese battleships were present at the review by the Emperor on the 11th October. If all these ships were in fullcommission this represents a considerable increase on the normal number. Otherunits showed no notable increase.
Italy and Italian Possessions.23. The lack of progress of the Italian advance beyond Sidi Barrani has given rise to many conjectures. Principal amongst these were the widespreadpress reports that. Marshal Graziani was to be superseded in command. no confirmation of these reports has yet been received. Meanwhile, there has been considerable motor transport activity in the forward and Line of Communicationareas consistent with the formation of forward dumps and the strengthening of communications.   Ground reconnaissance has also been carried out.24. Events in Italian East Africa have been limited to engagements betweenpatrols, in which the Italians have sustained the bulk of the casualties. There isno indication of any reduction in strength of the concentrations threatening theSudan and Kenya.The Balkan States.Greece.25. In spite of numerous rumours as to the imminence of attacks on Greeceboth from Albania and Bulgaria, it is still uncertain whether Greece will haveto face attack on these two fronts. The threat from Albania, however, has notdiminished and remains a real one. Reports indicate the possibility that, in theevent of a German move into Bulgaria, Turkish and Greek collaboration in mutualdefence will be assured. The determination of the Greek King and Governmentto resist invasion is still reported as firm. It is to be questioned, however, whetherthe morale of the Army and civilian population would for long stand up to seriousair attacks on Athens, Salonica and other principal towns.Yugoslavia.26. Various reports have been received of demands by Germany for thepassage of troops and material through Yugoslavia, but there is reliable evidencethat any such overtures have so far met with refusal. On the other hand, thereis little evidence of any decrease of Axis pressure or of the Governments apparentsubservience in the face of it. It seems that the Government hopes to avoid a crisis until winter, when invasion will be difficult. Meanwhile, there are 700,000men under arms to deter or resist the invader.Middle East.Egypt, Sudan and East Africa.27.   There has been no change in the operational situation during the week.28.   A convoy has arrived at Port Suez, consisting of- For Egypt One brigade group and, ancillary units.For Sudan One motor cavalry regt.One mountain battery and ancillary units.4,000 Australian reinforcements and the first echelon of the South African2nd contingent have also arrived.[21835] -   .   .

General Review.29. Night operations by our bombers against targets in Germany were con-siderably intensified in spite of unsuitable weather, but most of the daylight attacks by our medium bombers were abandoned. The enemy was able to increasehis scale of attack slightly by day and considerably by night and London continuedto sustain the heaviest weight of bombing.30. In the Mediterranean and Middle East, activity by the enemy wassingularly light and, with one exception, ineffective. Operations by the Royal AirForce were intensively maintained against Libyan ports, shipping, aerodromes,barracks and concentrations of transport. Operational aircraft casualties are recorded in Appendix V, and Appendix VI contains further extracts from RaidAssessment Reports.Enemy Territory in Europe.31. In spite of the fact that adverse weather again considerably hamperedoperations, Bomber Command flew 764 night sorties during the week. Daylightoperations were restricted to a total of twenty-two Blenheims, despatched toattack Channel ports and targets in Germany, and of these all but two abandonedtheir tasks owing to lack of cloud cover.32. On the nights of the llth-12th and the 13th-14th, severe icing con-ditions and heavy cloud hampered our heavy bombers. Results of attacks onprimary objectives were unobserved, except on the second night, when twenty-nineaircraft effectively bombed Boulogne, Havre, Calais, Dunkirk, Ostend andFlushing, causing large explosions in the dock areas. Coastal Command medium bombers also successfully attacked Havre, the Helder and Lorient on two nights,in addition to operations against other invasion ports.33. Under comparatively favourable conditions, successful attacks were launched against military targets in Berlin on two nights and on oil targets at hamburg, Reisholz, Leuna, Cologne, Magdeburg, Stettin, Bohlen Rotha andGelsenkirchen, the resultant damage at the last four being particularly severe.The railway line near Antwerp Docks was hit with a 1,000-lb. bomb. KruppsWorks at Essen were attacked on three nights and those at Kiel on one night.On the lOth-llth our aircraft started fires at Cherbourg preparatory to the Navalbombardment reported earlier in this Resume.34. Heavy bombers were despatched on two nights to attack Tirpitzat Wilhelmshaven but no definite results were reported, intense opposition fromground defences making observation difficult. During attacks on shipbuildingyards at Kiel, Hamburg and Bremen on two nights, by considerable forcesof heavy bombers, many bursts were seen near the reported positions ofGneisenau, Scharnhorst,, Lutzow, and Bismarck. A number of enemy aerodromes were bombed by single aircraft and attacks were continued againstmarshalling yards and industry in Germany.35. As a result of operations on the night of the 16th-7th October, three off our heavy bombers are missing and fourteen others crashed on landing owingto the exceptionally bad weather conditions.Great Britain.36. Daylight attacks consisted mainly of sweeps over South-E asternEngland, for which bomb-carrying fighters were increasingly employed; on the13th, each of the four raids plotted was entirely composed of fighters.37. Night attacks increased considerably in intensity and relays of aircraft,singly or in groups, were active over the country from dusk to dawn, the scale of attack usually diminishing after midnight.     On the 15th October the enemy
reverted to the dropping of parachute mines. New devices reported were a combined incendiary and explosive bomb, and large balloons for the distributionof leaflets.38. About three-quarters of the night attacks were directed against London,but bombs were also scattered over rural districts, particularly in the HomeCounties. In the Provinces, Liverpool, Birmingham, Coventry and Bristol sufferedcomparatively heavy attacks. On the 15th-16th the number of enemy aircraft operating over Great Britain was the highest experienced at night, some 450long-range bombers being employed. Throughout the week railway communica-tions seem to have received particular attention, and seventeen Royal Air Forcestations were attacked, though with negligible results. Enemy reconnaissanceactivity was continued on the same scale as before.39. During the week Fighter Command flew an average of 35 sorties eachnight and a total of 812 patrols, involving 4,005 sorties by day. Details of casulties are given in Appendix V. Two enemy aircraft were shot down by our fighters on the night of the 15th-16th, and at least two more were destroyed thefollowing night.North Sea and Coastal.40. During the week, 412 anti-invasion and anti-submarine patrols, andoffensive and photographic reconnaissances, involving 437 sorties, were flown by coastal Command aircraft and 135 Convoys were escorted. Aircraft of coastal command also took part in the offensive operations against the Channel Ports,which have already been described. The North Sea sweep was flown on five daysby six Bomber Command Blenheims. On the 15th a Sunderland dropped supplies to a ship&apos;s boat 94 miles west of St. Kilda and, on the following day, anotherSunderland landed twenty-one survivors from S.S. Sangrant at Oban.41. From ten to thirty enemy minelaying aircraft operated each night,mainly off the East and North-East Coasts, though similar activity was suspectedoff the South and North-Western coasts on two nights of the week.Middle East and Mediterranean.Malta.42. On the 8th October, four enemy aircraft approached the Island. AHurricane shot down one and severely damaged a second, the remaining twomaking off before reaching the coast. An air attack on the 16th is also reported,but no details have been received. On the 15th October, one of two Frenchaircraft (Loire 130), due to join the Richelieu, landed at Malta.Egypt and Libya.43. Our aircraft carried out four raids on Benghazi, resulting in direct hits on seven ships, the demolition of two large warehouses and considerable otherdamage. Tobruk was attacked on four days, and during these operations a direct hit was scored on a large ship and fires started among buildings of military importance. A number of aircraft were bombed on the ground at Bardia on the8th, and important buildings were successfully attacked, on the 12th and the 15th.On the 12tJh bombs were dropped among a group of twenty aircraft atEl Adem, causing considerable damage. On the 8th mechanised transport nearSidi Barrani, and on the 15th motor transport in Camp Halfaya was bombed.Barracks at Sollum and Derna were also attacked.44. On the 15th-16th October enemy aircraft made an abortive raid on theescarpment South of Fuka, and two waves of bombers attempted an attack onAlexandria without success. This was repeated on the following day, but with what effect is not yet known.
Sudan, Aden and East Africa.45. During the period under review aerodromes at Gura and Asmara wererepeatedly attacked with considerable success by our bombers from Kenya.Battles of the South African Air Force scored direct hits on an aerodromebuilding at Neghelli and upon a concentration of mechanised transport. Militarybuildings at Diredawa and Assab also received direct hits and a large fire was started at one of the piers at the latter place by Blenheims of the Indian Wingoperating from the Sudan.  Mai Adaga was bombed on two days.46. During the 12th and 13th October the enemy made three unsuccessfulattacks on Perim Island, and on the 13th a single aircraft attacked Aden and isbelieved to have been damaged by one of our Gladiators. In Kenya, Wajir andLodwar, near Lake Rudolph, were each attacked by three enemy aircraft on the10th, but no damage resulted. On the 16th October enemy aircraft attackedGedaref aerodrome in the Sudan, and destroyed eight Wellesleys and twoVincents on the ground. A single enemy aircraft also bombed troop positionsSouth of Kassala, but without inflicting damage or casualties.47. Ineffective air attacks were made on British naval units in the Red sea on the 14th October,, and an attack on a convoy was driven off by an escortingBlenheim fighter from Aden, one enemy aircraft probably being destroyed. Onthe following day an enemy aircraft dived into the sea after an unsuccessfulattack on H.MA.S. Parametta.Air Intelligence.Italy.48. Beyond the report, mentioned last week, that German transport aircraft were in Southern Italy, no reliable reports have been received of any german aircraft in Italy.49. It is reliably reported that the call for volunteers from Italy for theGerman Air Force has met with such poor response that the Italian authoritieshave been compelled to detail the personnel required for service in Germany.Hungary.50. An unconfirmed report states that 50 Hungarian pilots have gone toserve in Germany and that another 50 may be going shortly.Roumania.51. At the same time that the German A.A. artillery groups were installedat Ploesti, reports were received that a number of the aerodromes in the vicinitywould shortly be occupied by units of the German Air Force. The chief of theseare Floresti, Branesti, Baneasa, and Bacau, all of which are suitable for the location of fighter aircraft for the defence of the oil regions. The Roumanianshad previously placed four fighter squadrons at Floresti and two at Branesti forthis purpose.There are indications that the Germans are contemplating a much more comprehensive plan for the protection of the oil wells from possible air attack,by having a forward line of air defences in Bulgaria combined with a system ofobservation and listening posts.52. The German Military Attache at Bucharest is reported to have statedthat a Luft Division (which may consist of anything up to 360 bombers, 240fighters and some dive-bombers) would arrive in Roumania on the 13th Octoberunder the command of General Speidel. This may be an exaggeration, butGeneral Speidel, accompanied by four staff officers, arrived at Bucharest by air on the 12th October and was received with ceremony.53. Large German transport aircraft are reported to have been arriving atFloresti aerodrome and leaving with loads of petrol. It is possible that they aretaking the petrol to form fuel dumps in Hungary and Transylvania for theadvancing German forces.
Bulgaria.54. There is evidence that preparations have been made for some time pastfor the location of German aircraft in Bulgaria to form a forward line of air defence for the Roumanian oil fields. It is also believed that listening andobservation posts are being organised at Plovdiv, in Southern Bulgaria, and atLorn, in the north-west corner of the country.55. A large uniformed detachment of German officers and men which istouring the country has. called for some comment. The official explanation oftheir presence is that they belong to the German Press and Propaganda Servicesent to make films of Southern Dobrudja. It is also reported that special policepermits to tour southern Bulgaria have been given to certain German and Itali an&quot; merchants,&quot; who actually are Air Force officers.Turkey.56. An acute shortage of lubricating oil threatens drastically to restrict theactivities of the Turkish Air Force.Japan.57. When the air member of the Thai Mission to Japan visited the navalaerodrome at Yokosuka he received a very poor impression of the performance of japanese aircraft, which he considered obsolete according to Western standards.The report does not indicate what types he saw, but it is likely that they included the latest types of fighters and bombers in general service with the JapaneseNaval Air Force.   The opinion of this officer is considered reliable.58. In view of the propaganda value, as well as the target offered by the congestion likely on the opening of the Road, it is possible that the Japanese willattempt to start bombing the Burma Road at once. It is, however, unlikely thatintensive and sustained attacks can begin for another week.French West Africa.59. Fifteen military aircraft (type not known, but probably modernbombers) arrived at Dakar on the 12th October from Morocco, bringing the AirForce units in Senegal to a minimum total of about 90 aircraft. A report hasalso been received that it is intended to transport troops by air from Morocco toSenegal.Since the Dakar operation French aircraft in Senegal have been usedextensively for reconnaissance purposes. On the 7th October it was stated that since the 25th September repeated reconnaissances had been undertaken by french aircraft over Gambia, while on the 9th October reconnaissances were described as having been conducted on seven occasions since the 28th Septemberover Freetown harbour and aerodromes in Sierra Leone. There are indications that the Dakar-Natal air service is to be reopened.French Equatorial Africa.60. On the 12th October one French bomber flew over the town of Duala,dropping anti-British leaflets, which are described as being couched in violentterms. This aircraft must be presumed to have been operating from Togoland,&apos;Niger, or Dahomey. Its presence at Duala suggests that Niamey may have been reinforced with modern aircraft from Algeria.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.61. The force and extent of enemy air activity over this country is summarised under Air Situation.Damage.Aerodromes.62. Attacks were made on aerodromes every day and night except the 13th,but damage was negligible except at Milton (Carew Cheriton). where a hangarwas seriously damaged and a number of huts demolished.[21835] d
Aircraft Factories.63. The only aircraft factory sustaining damage during the week was general Aircraft Ltd. of Feltham, where four shops, including the repair shop,were gutted on the 10th. Although three aircraft factories were hit in the attack on Coventry on the 12th, the damage in each case was negligible.Electricity, Light and Power.64. A considerable amount of damage was done to utility services inLondon during this period. Six gas works were hit; at Wandsworth the cokehandling plant at the Fairfield Street works was damaged, and at Croydon agas holder was demolished. The electric power station ,and the substation atBankside, S.E.1 were hit.65. Outside London, the only case of severe damage was a gas main hit inthe Foleshill gas works at Coventry, and the resulting reduction in pressure willhave some effect on industrial output.Industry.66. General industrial damage is slight. The only outstanding incidentsare : (a) Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Co. Ltd., Yauxhall Works.Loss of production for some time; gas, water and electricity have failed.(b) Negretti and Zambra, Ltd., Barnsbury, N.l.Factory gutted.(c) Thames Ammunition Works, Erith.Production stopped for three days.(d) Siebe, Gorman and Co., Ltd., Camberwell.Fire caused damage to all sections and destroyed one sectioncompletely.(e) Rollason Aircraft Instruments, Ltd., Mitcham Junction.Building severely damaged.  Production suspended for some time.(f) Triumph Engineering Co., Ltd., Coventry.Considerable damage was caused to some of the buildings on the 14th.Production suspended in some departments, including the machineshop.Railways.67. Many hits have been made on the railway system, especially in theLondon area. Traffic has been retarded generally by raids and warnings, and london yards and sheds are still somewhat congested. Although the dailynumber of U.X.Bs. on the railway system is not great, forty still remain to bedealt with.Other Damage.68. Damage to civilian property and public buildings has been widespreadin London and in other areas. A feature of the damage has been the number ofhuildings of national importance which have been affected. St. paul&apos;s and thecathedrals of Canterbury and Coventry must take first place. In London theRoyal Courts of Justice, the National Gallery, Kensington Palace, St. James&apos;Church, Piccadilly, the Natural History Museum, the Treasury, the War Office,No. 10 Downing Street, have all suffered damage.69. The south-east coast towns have again suffered damage to civilianproperty, especially Hastings. Other parts of Kent, Surrey and Essex have sustained considerable damage and there has been damage to residential property in Liverpool, Manchester, Coventry, Luton, Birmingham and Middlesbrough.Civilian Casualties.70. The approximate figures for the week ending 0600 hours, 16th October,are 1,567 killed and 4,634 injured. These figures include the estimated figuresof 1,380 killed and 3,729 injured in London.
13Disposal of Unexploded Mines and Bombs.71. The enemy dropped magnetic mines over the London Area on thenights of 15th-16th and 16th-17th October.Twenty-three of these mines did not explode. Thirteen have now been rendered safe and the remaining ten are being attended to by Naval personnel.One mine at Shoreditch detonated during the operation of rendering safe,causing two casualties.The number of unexploded bombs in the country remaining to be dealtwith is in the region of 3,000. There are some 900 outstanding in Londonregion, where between 50 and 100 are reported each day. A small proportionof these unexploded bombs have subsequently detonated.Warnings.72. London has had 23 warnings by day, of an average length of about40 minutes. On the last day of the period there were six warnings. Liverpoolhas had six day warnings and Birmingham two. London, Liverpool, birmingham and Bristol have had night warnings averaging respectively 9 hours 30 minutes,2 hours 25 minutes, 4 hours 30 minutes and 4 hours 20 minutes.Civil Defence Operations.73. An important development of this week is the initiation of a schemefor the appointment of Alarm Officers in Observer Corps Centres. Their dutywill be to communicate a more localised air raid &quot;alarm&quot; to certain firms engaged in vital national production. These alarms will augment the systemof roof-spotting and the scheme is not intended to interfere with any system oflocal warnings now in operation.It is also proposed to appoint Regional Alarm Officers to supervise theworking of the system in their respective areas.Morale.74. Public morale during the past week has continued on a high level,though there is some evidence of strain.Despite the incidents involving Tube Stations, the number of peoplesheltering in the underground system shows no sign of diminishing. It still remains at about 120,000 per night.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources :  Germany.Berlin. Several reports have been received of damage to the Anhalter,Lehrter and Stettiner Stations. It is believed that the Anhalter Station is themost affected. The services of the U-Bahn and the Rapid Transit System havebeen temporarily suspended in certain districts. The district near the KottbusserTor and Dresden Strasse has been particularly affected. A four-storey factorynear the Anhalter Station, about to be utilised by Daimler Benz Flugmotoren-werke, has suffered severely in the upper parts. The necessary machinery had only just been installed.Bremen. Fires started on the night of the llth/12th September were still-smouldeTing twondays&quot; afterwardsrStettin. On the night of the 2nd/3rd October a large ship loaded withgrain was hit and fired.Hamburg. The oil refineries in the Neuhof district are stated to havebeen put out of action. Shipyards have cancelled orders for large keels. Thisis stated to be due to air raids and the damage caused.Gelsenkirchen. The gasometer, the largest on the Continent, has been hit and rendered useless.Holland.Haarlem. A benzine depot has been destroyed.France.La Rochelle. Photographs disclose that the long sheds on the dock sidenear the station have been burnt out.Mining.The liner Flanalre of the Compagnie General Transatlantique has been mined and beached at the mouth of the Gironde.Owing to the loss of three fishing vessels at Lorient, the fishing harbour isno longer in use.The Russian Tourist Bureau has discontinued the visits of its showsteamer Molotov to Stettin or German harbours to the westward on account ofthe danger of raids and mines.Two rows of buoys are expected to be placed shortly between Malmo andCopenhagen to indicate a passage free from mines. This passage will be sweptregularly by Swedish and German minesweepers.
