Naval assistance to the Greeks is being rendered bythe Mediterranean Fleet.S.S. Empress of Britain has been lost by air attack.Heavy gales prevailed round the British Islands during the latter part of theweek, and bad weather has been responsible for several casualties.A. U/B has been sunk in the N.W. Approaches.Home Waters.2. H.M. Submarine Sword fish attacked a convoy of 8 camouflaged enemy merchant ships off Cherbourg on the 27th October, and claimed one hit with a torpedo. Destroyers which were sent to intercept this convoy failed to locate it.E-Boats were reported in the Channel on the 26th and 30th, and were unsuccess-fully attacked by our aircraft.3. On the 24th October H.M. Destroyer Mendip was seriously damaged bythe accidental explosion of a depth charge during working-up practices at ScapaFlow; 5 ratings are missing and 6 were wounded. On the 30th OctoberH.M. Destroyer Sturdy ran aground in bad weather on Tiree in the Hebrides andsubsequently broke in half. 3 ratings were lost. On the 26th, when N.W. of theBloody Foreland, the S.S. Empress of Britain (42,432 tons) returning from theMiddle East with 224 passengers, of which 150 were naval and military personnel,was bombed and -machine-gunned by a four-engined Focke Wolfe aircraft. Theship was set on fire.and later taken in tow, but sank after an internal explosionat 0205 on the 28th October. The total complement on board was 643, of which598 have been landed, including 10 killed.4. H.M. Drifter Harvest Gleaner was bombed and sunk off Southwold onthe 28th October, and H.M. Trawler Arctic Trapper was bombed and subsequentlybeached at Ramsgate on the 29th.   *Mines have caused the following casualties : On the 25th H.M. Trawler LordInchcape was sunk off Plymouth breakwater, and H.M. Trawler St. Wistan offthe Humber. H.M. Destroyer Walpole was damaged on the 28th and towed toHarwich, and MX. 109 was sunk on the 30th October off the Humber, there being3 survivors.Weather conditions have prevented the attempt to tow off H.M. DestroyersAshanti and Fame, reported last week as aground.H.M. Submarine H. 49 is overdue from ;patrol off the Texel and must be presumed lost.H.M. Destroyers Broadwater, Burnham, Burwell and Bradford (ex-U.S.S.)arrived in the Clyde on the 26th October.Northern Waters.5. At 0525 on the 27th October a suspicious vessel, possibly an enemy raider,was sighted 600 miles west of Ireland on a north-easterly course, and a forceof battle cruisers, cruisers and destroyers sailed to intercept her. The weather-was bad and visibility poor, and no enemy ships were sighted.H.M.A.S. Australia in the course of this operation, when 300 miles N.W. ofthe Butt of Lewis, picked up 9 survivors out of a crew of 13 of a Sunderlandflying boat which had made a forced landing and capsized.Iceland was reconnoitred by a twin-engined enemy monoplane on the28th October.
H.M. Gunboat Aphis, in co-operation with the R.A.F., successfullybombarded enemy concentrations at Sidi Barrani on the 25th October.A portion of the Mediterranean Fleet sailed to cover a convoy proceeding tothe Piraeus and Dardanelles on the 26th October, but was recalled to refuel onaccount of the Italian ultimatum to Greece. The Fleet sailed from its baseduring the night of 28th/29th to assist the Greeks.H.M. Submarines Rainbow and Triad are now overdue and must be presumed lost.Gibraltar.7. The northern entrance to Gibraltar harbour was attacked on the morning of the 30th October by two small Italian &apos;&apos; one-man &apos;&apos; submarines. no damage was caused.   One Italian officer and one rating were picked up.West Africa.8. H.M.S. Delhi intercepted the French S.S. AIM, 4,149 tons, off Duala onthe 25th October. This ship was on passage in ballast from Casablanca toLibreville and was scuttled, the crew being picked up by the Delhi.China.9. A Japanese armed boarding party stopped the British S.S. Monsang,3,420 tons, on the 25th October when 160 miles north of Formosa (outside theJapanese prohibited area) and removed parts of the wireless apparatus. Theship was later allowed to proceed.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. On the 30th October H.M. Destroyers Harvester, Highlander andScimitar attacked and sank a U-Boat which had previously unsuccessfully attacked the S.S. Balzac 135 miles west of Bloody Foreland. Thirty-twosurvivors were rescued. Other than this there were no attacks by surface crafton U-Boats.Three attacks have been made by aircraft, one off the Norwegian Coast andtwo to the west of Bloody Foreland, but in none of these was there any definite evidence of success.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.1.1. During the period 12 ships have been reported sunk, totalling 69,246tons. Included in the above total is 61,402 tons of British shipping; 3 by U-Boat(16,150 tons), 5 by mine (2,904 tons), one ship, S.S. Empress of Britain(42,348 tons), by aircraft attack, and 3 Allied ships (7,844 tons), 2 of which were sunk by U-Boats and one by mine. In addition 6 ships (32,412 tons) reported last week as damaged are now known to have been sunk. Full details will befound in Appendix I.On the 25th October a westbound Channel Convoy was twice unsuccessfullybombed off Deal and later shelled off Dover.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. 720 ships, including 108 Allied and 34 Neutral, were convoyed duringthe week ending Wednesday, the 30th October. 6 ships in convoy were sunk.Since the commencement of hostilities 41,691 ships have been convoyed, including4,143 Allied and 4,083 Neutral. Losses in convoy are British 133, Allied 18,Neutral 13 a total of 164, giving a ratio of losses to numbers convoyed ofBritish 1 in 252, Allied 1 in 230, Neutral 1 in 314. Total, 1 in 254. 15 armed merchant Cruisers, 42 Destroyers, 16 Sloops and 30 Corvettes were employedon escort duties.Convoys have been affected by gales, and 5 ships of a south-bound Convoy onthe East Coast grounded near Rattray Head in bad weather early on the30th October.[21868]b
13. In spite of the loss of 29 ships sustained in the Convoys which arrivedlast week, imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the period the19th-26th October totalled 842,753 tons, compared with 847,477 tons for the weekending the 12th October, and the average of 929,843 tons for the previous ten weeks. Mineral imports were 300,652 tons, of which 247,604 tons were steel,scrap-iron, pig-iron and ore, compared with 230,579 tons (of which 150,944 tons were steel, &amp;c.) for the previous week. Sixteen tankers brought 172,077 tons,compared with 80,258 tons in eight tankers during the seven days ending the19th October. Timber and pulp imports were 119,062 tons and cereal imports were 101,942 tons, a fall of 33,904 tons. Five ships carried full cargoes of grainand flour.  Other food imports totalled 61,568 tons.Enemy Intelligence.German surface forces.14. The Gneisenau is believed to have been damaged by a hit or a near-misswhilst in dock at Kiel during a bombing attack on the night of the28th/29th October.Photographic reconnaissance on the 29th October showed the battleshipTirpitz still at Wilhelmshaven. The battleship Bismarck is believed to be under-going trials in the Baltic. The 8-inch cruiser Prinz Eugen has left Hamburg.The pocket battleship Admiral Scheer and two 6-inch cruisers are unlocated. A6-inch cruiser, either the Emden or the Koln, was reported passing Copenhagennorthbound on the 28th October. It is estimated that there are 5 or 6 effectivedestroyers still in German Home Waters. Air reconnaissance on the 30th Octobershowed at least 6 destroyers at Brest.Shipping.15. There has been no marked change in the disposition of shipping in theenemy-occupied ports during the week, except that on the 27th October therewere signs of a considerable movement of ships to the Eastwards, but this hasnot so far been continued.:U-Boats.16. The main German U-boat dispositions remain as in the last few weeks.Four or possibly five have been at work in the North-West Approaches and furtherout, one or two well to the Northward between 580 N. and 600 N. There havebeen indications of submarines on passage both to and from Lorient, and of onehomeward bound via the Norwegian Coast which, after being damaged by air attack, entered the Skagerrak. Since the beginning of October it has beennoticeable that there have been few reports of submarines on passage throughthe North Sea; on the other hand, the use of Lorient as a base has steadilyincreased. For some time after the 22nd July, when the first U-Boat arrived in Lorient, the port was only used for short visits, but latterly there has beenevidence from photographic reconnaissances of as many as 8 or 9 U-boats in theport, and that these are docked and repaired there. It is thought that, in viewof the better repair facilities available in French than in Norwegian ports, thispolicy will be increasingly pursued in the future, and that Norwegian ports willlargely be used as stopping places for submarines homeward bound for Germanyafter 2 or 3 cruises, to give leave. There is no reason to believe that any. of the submarines in Lorient came there by way of the English Channel, and it ispossible that fear of air attack, has made them take the long sea route fromGermany.Italian Main Units.17. There has been little change in the disposition of the Italian main units in the past week except that one squadron of cruisers appears to have been sent from Taranto to Brindisi. The position on the 30th September was as follows:Taranto, 5 battleships, 8 cruisers, 8 destroyers; Brindisi, 6 cruisers and destroyers. There have been certain movements of cruisers and destroyers inthe Straits of Otranto, and on the 29th October 2 warships, probably cruisers,
were observed from Corfu to be convoying a transport from Italy to the Albanianmainland. There has so far been no other sign of activity in the Ionian Islandsor in the Gulf of Patras areas.Italian U-boats.18. With the exception of one submarine believed to be returning toBordeaux on the 25th October, the signs of Italian submarine activity in the atlantic have been inconclusive during the past week.     ,Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.19. An air reconnaissance of Bremerhaven on the 28th October showed that either the Bremen or the Europa had left.A report has been received that the Norwegian ship Black Watch, 5,035 tons,was sunk by aircraft in mid-September while carrying German troopsnorthwards.German tankers are reported to have been seen off Pasajes on the 15th andthe 16th October. The tankers known to be at sea are the Rekum, 5,540 tons,which left Teneriffe on the 17th July, the Eurof eld, 5,947 tons, which left Teneriffeon the 3rd September, and the Gedania, 8,923 tons, which left Las Palmas on the14th October and is expected to arrive at St. Nazaire about the 30th or the31st October.By the 23rd October the Achilles, 998 tons, had completed boiler repairs atVigo and anchored in the Bay. She is ready for sea and expected to sail. TheSpezia, 1,825 tons, sailed from Valencia with a Spanish crew at 2200/22, carrying a cargo of resin and fruit, bound presumably for Genoa.It has been reported that of the German ships sunk in the Narvik action theBockenheim, 4,902 tons, is still aground, the oil refinery ship Jan Wellem, 11,766tons, and two others will soon be afloat, and the Lippe, 8,749 tons, is being salved.20. The Germans are reported to be chartering Roumanian ships, and alsotwo Bulgarian ships, the Balkan, 3,838 tons, and the Shipka, 2,300 tons, for usein the Black Sea.The Cordelia, 1,357 tons, the Arkadia, 1,756 tons, and the Ithaka, 1,773 tons,left Galatz on the 23rd October in ballast for a Russian port. On the same day the Salzburg, 1,756 tons, arrived at Galatz with a general cargo from Istanbul.On the 28th October the Norburg, 2,392 tons, and the Delos, 2,589 tons, botharrived at Galatz from Russia, the first with 3,800 tons of manganese ore, thesecond with 4,000 tons of barley, the Yalova, 3,750 tons, left Galatz for Batum.21. The Regensburg, 8,068 tons, which left Yokohama on the27th September, went to VTadivostock and is now reported to have arrived backat Yokohama. The Anneliese Essberger, 5,173 tons, which sailed from Kobe onthe 9th October, returned to her moorings there on the 11th October. TheKulmerland, 7,363 tons, which sailed with her has not returned. It has beenreported from Shanghai that the Saarland, 6,725 tons, has been sold to a firm in tokyo for 500,000 United States dollars. Efforts to get oil for three german ships in Callao, Chile, had, on the 15th October, been unsuccessful.The Helgoland, 3,664 tons, sailed from Puerto Colombia on the 28th October.She is reported to be carrying cases of machinery on deck, and to have on boardGerman pilots of the Colombian-Panamanian Air Company.22. The Rudolph Albrecht, 3,819 tons, at Teneriffe was reported on the24th October to have taken oil from an Italian tanker and to have embarked a supply of food preparatory to sailing. She is heavily laden and has been paintedgrey overall with a black band round the funnel.It was reported on the 24th October that all German ships at Las Palmashad received orders to be ready to sail within twenty days. There are three german ships including one tanker there, and one at Palma. One of those atLas Palmas, the Madrid, 8,777 tons, has been showing signs of imminent departureand it is rumoured that she will make for Casablanca or Dakar.Italian.23. The Popolo d&apos;Italia of the .9th October admits that a steamer of 1,800tons had been sunk in the Western Mediterranean.  This would appear to confirm
the sinking of the Franco Fassio. It has been reported that the Carbonia1,237 tons was sunk by a submarine off Durazzo on the 22nd August. This maybe one of the two ships sunk by H.M.S. Rorqual.The Corteliazzo (5,292 tons), which had previously been reported as being at Yokohama, is now known to have left that port on the 5th June and to havearrived at Dairen, where she still is, the next day.On the 24th October it was reported that all the Italian ships at Las Palmashad received instructions to be ready to sail within twenty days. There are tenItalian ships, including two tankers, in this port.British Minelaying.24. The only minelaying by H.M. Ships during the current week has been by H.M.S. Teviot Bank and H.M.S. Plover, which laid 350 mines in the east coast Barrier on the 28th October. Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out,mainly by Bomber Command. The areas mined include the coasts of germany as far as the Baltic and the Atlantic coast of France.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.25. Six mines have been swept in the minefield laid by the enemy ofEalmouth. From the results of sweeping in the Falmouth field generally itappears that the mines were laid in zig -zag lines between the Lizard andSouth-East of Dodman Point.Only one mine has been cut in the Dover area this week. In the contactminefield East of Harwich one mine was swept early in the week by FleetSweepers ahead of Convoys, though two sweeps were parted by anti-sweepingdevices.26. Enemy aircraft have increased their minelaying activities, and it isestimated that about one-third of the nightly raiders are occupied in minelaying.Both- magnetic mines and acoustic mines are being laid, but it is not possible tomake any estimate of in what proportion. It is thought probable that twelveout of the nineteen casualties which have occurred this week have been caused byacoustic mines and five by magnetic mines, the other two being more doubtful.Minelaying has been widespread round our coasts from Aberdeen south about to Belfast and the Clyde, though the Thames Estuary and the Downs appear tohave been left freer than usual.About midday on the 27th October six enemy seaplanes were sighted layingmines close to one of the War Channels north-east of Cromer. Two of thesemines were later sunk by an A/P trawler. Northbound traffic has been temporarily diverted to another channel.27. LL Sweeps have exploded mines in the following areas: Blyth 2,Tyne 6, Humber 2, Tongue 1, Upper Bristol Channel 1, Milford Haven 1,Clyde 1, Belfast 1. H.M.S. Icarus exploded two acoustic mines within twominutes of each other 400 and 800 yards off, outside the Humber. She was cables astern of another destroyer steaming 25 knots.The totals of mines accounted for are : magnetic 735, contact 655, andacoustic 33.Various forms of anti-acoustic mine-sweep are under trial, though only oneso far is sufficiently advanced to have been tried in the sea and results have notyet been reported. Until an acoustic mine has been recovered and more certain information obtained, it is impossible to lay down any definite rules as to theprocedure for H.M. Ships in waters thought to be acoustically mined.State of Greek Fleet.The following is the latest information concerning the state of readiness ofthe Greek Fleet: Cruiser Averoff. 9,000 tons. Four 9-2-inch and eight 7-5-inch. Completed1911. Laid up for retubing September 1939. Doubtful if ship canput to sea.
Destroyers B. Giorgios I and B. Olaa. 1,420 tons. Four 5-inch; 8 torpedo tubes.Completed 1939.P. Coundouriotis, Hydra, Spetsai and Psara. 1,480 tons. Four4-7-inch; 6 torpedo tubes.   Completed 1932-33.Leon, Panther, I erase and Aetos. 1,013 tons. Four 4-inch; 6 torpedotubes. Completed 1912. On the 27th June, 1940, not fully manned,but in good sea-going condition.Torpedo boats 13 in number. 120 to 350 tons. Four have two 3-inch guns, remaindereither one 11-pdr. or two 6-pdr. Completed between 1906 and 1915.On the 27th June, 1940, three or four torpedo boats were employed for training duties.Submarines Glaucos, Nereus, Triton, Proteus, Katsonis and Papanicolis. first four are of 700 tons with one 4-inch gun and 8 torpedo tubes. Lasttwo are of 600 tons with one 4-inch gun and 6 torpedo tubes.Possibly all, and probably four, ready for sea.No information is available concerning the disposition of the Greek Fleet.All units, however, are believed to be in home waters.Roumania.There have been many reports of the assembly of German submarines sentin parts via the Danube to Roumania for service in the Black Sea. The origin of these seems to be the two Roumanian submarines which are being built to german designs and which are delayed by the difficulty of getting essential partsfrom Germany in the present circumstances.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.28. There have been reports of a deterioration in tlhe morale of the german armed forces, but there is no convincing evidence that the morale of the german army has shown any general deterioration since the war. As far as can be judged,Germany is.still convinced that she can and will win.Italy and Italian Possessions.Italian-Greek Campaign.29. An ultimatum was delivered by Italy to Greece at 0300 on the28th October and expired at 0600. The Greeks refused the terms and invokedGreat Britain&apos;s assistance. Artillery duels lasted till 1800, and the Greeks,retired from several advanced posts to previously prepared positions.The Italian forces on the Greco-Albanian frontier comprise seven divisions,with a considerable amount of artillery and A.F.Vs. Operations have begunslowly, and the principal Italian advance is directed from the south-westerncorner of Albania along the western coast of Greece. It is possible that this isintended initially as a diversion, and that an attack from the Koritsa area towardsFiorina and Salonika may develop later when certain Greek forces are engaged inthe Epirus.Libya.30. No further advance eastward from SidiBarrani has yet begun. It is,nevertheless, probable that this may be timed to coincide with the beginning ofa full-scale offensive from Albania. There is still no confirmation of any Germanformations being in Libya.[21868] c
Italian East Africa.31. There has been little activity during the week. Concentrations on theSudan and Kenya frontiers are still in position, and offensive activity may betimed to coincide with an eastward advance from Libya and the beginning of afull-scale offensive against Greece.The Balkan States and Turkey.Bulgaria.32. King Boris&apos;s resistance to German pressure is reported to be weakening,and General had i-Petkoff, Chief of the General Staff, is growing steadily moreGermanophil. The way is thus being prepared for co-operation with Germany.Russian propaganda, however, particularly among the lower ranks of the army,is steadily on the increase and is strongly anti-German.Yugoslavia.33. There is good reason to believe that the Italian invasion of Greece tookYugoslavia by surprise, and, although certain military measures, more especially the full mobilisation of the three divisions in South Yugoslavia, are being putin hand, there seems virtually no hope that the Yugoslavs will take any directmilitary action in support of Greece.Roumania.34. The estimate of German troops in Roumania is still in theneighbourhood of 30,000-40,000 men, which includes instructional cadres for theRoumanian Army, troops for the defence of the oil districts and the Cernavoda-Braila-Focsani defence lines.Turkey.35. The general attitude in Turkey is one of sympathy for Greece andantagonism towards Italy. She has repeated her assurance that she will come to greece&apos;s aid if the latter country is attacked by Bulgaria.Iceland.36. The Inspector-General of Training returned to the United Kingdom onthe 28th October, from his tour of inspection in Iceland.The Middle East.37. There has been no change in the operational situation during the week in Egypt, Sudan and East Africa.Egypt.38. A convoy consisting of ancillary troops arrived at Suez from India onthe 26th October.East Africa.39. The 2nd South African Contingent consisting of Brigade headquarters and three Battalions with supporting units has arrived in Kenya.Far East.40.   A Commander-in-Chief of all land and air forces in Burma, Malaya and hong Kong and Far East generally has been appointed.   Air Chief Marshal&apos; Brooke Popham, with Major-General R. H. Dewing as his Chief of Staff, left theUnited Kingdom on the 27th October to take up the appointment.
General Review.41. In spite of unfavourable weather conditions which have continued to affect operations to an appreciable extent, our bombing effort against Germany-was on double the scale of the previous week. Although a variety of objectives were attacked, the main weight of attack was directed against the enemy&apos;s oil industry and his shipbuilding yards. Berlin was visited on three occasions, butprojected large-scale attacks on targets in Italy had to be abandoned owing tothe unfavourable conditions.An average of approximately 200 enemy aircraft operated over this countryeach night of the week, and by day enemy activity was on an increased scale.In the Mediterranean and Middle East our offensive operations were main-tained in all areas, but enemy activity was of a very minor nature.Operational Aircraft Battle Casualties and Raid Assessment Reports are recorded in Appendices V and VI.Enemy Territory in Europe.42. A total of 636 night-flying sorties and 47 day sorties were made by bomber Command Aircraft during the week under review. Coastal Command, inaddition to their normal duties, also despatched 14 aircraft on bombing missions.43. On several nights adverse weather conditions precluded exact identifiea-tion of objectives. Nevertheless, successful results were obtained during the attack of oil targets, particularly at Cologne, Leuna, Politz, and Hamburg, where1,000-lb. bombs fell on the target, causing fires which were visible for many miles.44. The enemy&apos;s naval bases and shipyards also appear to have sufferedextensive damage as a result of our attacks. On the night 28th-29tlh Octoberfires were started at Kiel, Wilhelmshaven, Hamburg, Bremen and Cuxhaven, anda hit is believed to have been obtained on the Gneisenau or its dock at Kiel.45. Operations on -targets in the Berlin area were cancelled on two nights,but were carried out on three, the most successful attacks taking place on the24th-25th, when targets were bombed by eight of our aircraft, resulting in a verylarge fire, and again on the 26th-27th, when Electricity Works and railway yardswere attacked with heavy calibre bombs.46. Eight heavy bombers were despatched to attack the Skoda ArmamentFactory at Pilsen, and, though only one aircraft succeeded in attacking the target,fierce fires were started followed by large explosions. Successful attacks havealso been made on the power stations at Brest and Lorient. During the week,aircraft unable to locate their primary targets have attacked a large number of enemy aerodromes.Great Britain.47. Enemy air activity by day has been on a considerably increased scale,and was principally directed against the South-Eastern counties and London.A very high proportion of the aircraft operating were again fighters, some ofwhich carried bombs. The heaviest attacks during daylight were made on the25th, 27th and 29th. On each of these days about four hundred and fifty to five hundred enemy aircraft were employed.48. Our fighters had a most successful day on the 29th October, destroyingtwenty-eight enemy aircraft for the loss of seven aircraft and two pilots. Ofthese, two aircraft were destroyed and one pilot killed by bombs when taking off from North Weald aerodrome. On the same day twelve of the aircraft operating against this country were reported by the A.A. to be Italian; they dropped bombs in the vicinity of Dover Harbour, but did not penetrate further over this country.49. A notable feature of the German Air Force&apos;s operations has been thenumber of Royal Air Force stations that have been attacked. Over forty differentaerodromes were attacked, mainly at dusk, and many of them, also, both bombed and machine gunned.  The principal damage inflicted was at Montrose, Driffield,
Heston and West Raynham. Some damage was done at a number of otherstations, but in the majority of cases the damage was slight. During these attacksa D.O. 17 was shot down when attacking Felt well, and a HE. Ill crashed onLossiemouth aerodrome and exploded.50. Enemy attacks by night were principally directed against London,Birmingham and Coventry. The lightest attack was on the night of the24th/.25th October, when one hundred and twenty long-range bombers were employed. On the nights of the 25th/26th and the 29th/30th October, however,two hundred and fifty bombers operated over this country. The total number of long-range bombers operating at night for the period was 1,325.51. During the week Fighter Command flew 230 night sorties and by day906 patrols, involving 4,671 aircraft. The total number of enemy aircraft forthe period estimated to bave operated over this country by day was 2,180. Detailsof casualties are given in Appendix VI.North Sea arid Coastal.52. During the week 322 anti-invasion and anti-submarine patrols andoffensive and photographic reconnaissances, involving 527 sorties, were flown by aircraft of the Coastal Command. 130 Convoy escorts were provided The north sea sweep was flown on six days by six Bomber Command Blenheims, and mines were laid in enemy waters by a total of eighteen aircraft.53. On the 26th October a Sunderland of Coastal Command assisted naval units in the rescue of survivors of the Empress of Britain (see paragraph 3), andthree Blenheim fighters provided protection against attacks. On the afternoon of the same day three Beauforts torpedoed a merchant vessel in the Aspo Fjord(Norway). They were then attacked by twelve enemy fighters, and two of theBeauforts are missing; one enemy fighter was shot down. On the following daytwo other Beauforts scored a possible hit on a merchant vessel off Ameland.54. Minelaying operations off our coasts were continued at night by theenemy, the total aircraft for the week engaged on these operations being 190.Middle East and Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.55. Our aircraft made two night attacks on Benghazi, bombs dropping inthe vicinity of workshops and railway sidings, and fires being started on the aerodrome at Berca. On the night of the 24th/25th a combined atatck by air and naval forces was made on an enemy position at Maktila, as a result of whicha petrol dump is believed to have been set on fire. On the 25th two attacks weremade by the Blenheims on Tobruk. Bombs fell among M.T., and supply dumpsand buildings in the vicinity of the Naval Barracks were demolished.56. Extensive operations were carried out against enemy landing grounds and bases along the coast from Derna to Sollum. Many fires were started and anumber of buildings hit, including the Naval Barracks at Tobruk. Heavy attacks were also made on enemy camps in the area north of Sidi Barrani and bombs were seen to fall among tents and concentrations of M.T.,57. Minor enemy activity is reported in the region of the Suez Canal, andbombs were dropped near Ismailia and the Bitter Lakes, but no casualties or damage resulted.Malta.58. Enemy activity against Malta has been of a minor nature only. On the24th enemy aircraft approached, but did not fly over the Island. On the 27theight Italian fighters which flew over the Island were intercepted by sixHurricanes and two enemy aircraft are claimed to have been damaged.59. Extensive daily reconnaissances have been made of the Ionian Sea,and on the 30th October a Sunderland carrying out a reconnaissance of the Corfu-Brindisi-Taranto        shot down an Italian bomber.
Gibraltar.60. During the week 13 anti-submarine patrols, 11 reconnaissances and7 special patrols were carried out. Air action against the base has beennegligible, and was confined to one Glenn Martin which flew over the Rock, butdropped no bombs.Sudan, Aden and East Africa.61. A number of attacks have been made upon Assab and hits scored inthe compound, on buildings, and on the pier. Attacks were also carried out against the aerodrome at Alomata, where bombs were seen to fall among aircraftdispersed on the ground. Enemy troop concentrations south of Metemma,buildings N.W. of Kassala railway station, and enemy troops in the vicinity havealso been attacked.62. Two Hurricanes of the S.A.A.F. intercepted three S. 81 bombers, shot down two of them and a third is believed to have crashed. A dive-bombing attack was made on enemy camps and workshops at Muji, and bombs were also dropped on a camp near Lake Bor. On the 30th October, in the Asmara area, militarybuildings, encampments, and a railway compound were attacked. An attack onthe main quays at Massawa by Blenheim aircraft resulted in considerable damage.63. Standing fighter patrols were maintained over Aden, and punitivebombing was continued against the Quteibis.64. Attacks made by the enemy on objectives in this area of operations havebeen peculiarly ineffective. Enemy aircraft attacked a convoy in Port SudanHarbour, but the damage caused was negligible.Air Intelligence.Italy.65. Mention has been made of the appearance of Italian aircraft engaged on operations against this country. Both German and Italian communiques havemade much of this Italian participation, but it is significant that the results achieved were singularly ineffective; there being a marked tendency not to pressattacks home but to release their bombs into the sea.66. There are reports of Italian collaboration with the German Air Eorce tothe extent of a complete Air Corps, but it is believed that only a small numberof aircraft have so far arrived in Belgium for this purpose.67. Reports continue to be received of Italian pilots undergoing dive-bombing training under German instruction, employing both Italian and german aircraft.Bulgaria.68. There are indications that an effort is being made to accelerate workon Bulgarian aerodromes, especially in the extreme south, in anticipation of the arrival of German aircraft. The Bulgarian plan to improve their aerodromes is far behind schedule, and in their present state even the main bases will remainserviceable for only short intervals when the winter sets in. A number of Germantechnicians, distributed among the main Bulgarian aerodromes, and a few flyinginstructors are already reported in the country.Roumania.69. In spite of the extensive measures taken for the defence of the oil wells,the Germans are reported to be extremely nervous of an air attack upon them.This nervousness has affected the civil population, which has begun to leavethe area.70. No marked increase in the numbers of German aircraft in Roumaniaappears to (have taken place during the past week. Although bomber, dive-bomber, fighter and troop-carrying aircraft are all represented, the total isbelieved to be less than 200 aircraft.[21868] d
Greece.71. The little information that is available regarding air operations in greece shows clearly that they have so far been of a very minor nature only. TheItalians attacked Tatoi Aerodrome, near Athens, at the opening of hostilities,but the damage caused was negligible and one Italian aircraft is reported to havebeen brought down. Attacks have also been made on the harbour and town ofPatras, but again little material damage or casualties to civilians is reported.72. The Italians have stated in an official communique that they will notbomb Athens but will respect the ancient monuments of Greece.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.73. The force and extent of enemy air activity is summarised under air situation.74. Instances of machine-gunning have been reported from a number of places and some casualties have resulted. In most cases villages and open townshave been selected for this form of attack.75. During the week very few parachute mines have been reported. Twoexploded at Tynemouth and two more have been reported as having exploded in mid-air in the Reading and Bristol areas.Damage.Aircraft Factories.76. Fairey Aviations Works at Hayes were attacked on the 24th and the27th October. On the first occasion, the main store was damaged and there wasa loss of 24 hours&apos; production. On the second occasion an unexploded bomb causedfurther loss.77. At Coventry, Armstrong Siddeley&apos;s Works were hit on the27th October, and a fire was started which did only slight damage. An ineffectivemachine-gun attack was directed against these works on the 30th October.78. Napier&apos;s Aero-Engine Works at Acton were also hit, but production was only slightly affected.Public Utilities.79. Four London electricity power stations were hit during this week,but in no case were supplies interrupted, though at Croydon a 25,000-k.w. Setwas wrecked.Three gas works were hit, two in London and one in Birmingham, but little damage resulted.The Metropolitan Water Board&apos;s pumping station at Surbiton was hit onthe 26th October.   The filter bed was considerably damaged.At Salton the Worcester Park Sewage Works were damaged during a day-light raid on the 27th October, and a large quantity of sewage was dischargedinto tJhe Beverley Brook.Telecommunications.80. In London, 28 trunklines and 36,000 subscribers are affected by con-siderable damage done to cables, and some difficulty is being experienced in keeping abreast of repairs. Five telephone exchange buildings in London were slightly damaged. In the provinces telecommunications were only slightlyaffected, and no damage was done to wireless stations.Industry.81. In comparison with the two previous weeks a much smaller number of factories and industrial premises were hit, but the proportion of cases in which
severe damage was sustained was higher.    The principal incidents are asfollows : Mersey Docks, Bootle.North gates of Gladstone-Hornby lock damaged; small vessels only canuse the lock.Anglo-American Oil Co., Ltd., Silvertown.A very large tank smashed and pipes damaged.Bulpitt and Sons, Camden Street, Birmingham.(Ammunition Parts, &amp;c). Factory gutted.Stratton and Co., Ltd., Bromsgove Street, Birmingham.(W.T. Sets).   Factory gutted.British Sugar Corporation, Allscott, Salop.Production held up seven/ten days.United Wire Works, Adderley St., Birmingham.Rolling mill and annealing plant idle until  roof renewed,  plantthoroughly examined and water supply restored.Wray, Ltd., Bromley Hill, Kent.(Sights.)   Production seriously curtailed.Humber, Ltd., Coventry.(Aero-engine components.)   Damage by fire to service department andengine repair section.Railways.82. The number of hits on London&apos;s railway system was 56 as comparedwith 77 during the previous week and 142 the week before. Elsewhere they rose to 42 as against 38 and 31.In London, the Waterloo-Clapham Junction stretch was hit, and services atWaterloo are severely restricted. The Central London line was badly damagedat Acton cemetery, and it is reported that traffic will be suspended for aconsiderable time.At Birmingham, New Street station suffered substantial damage on three occasions.   Snow Hill station was hit twice, and camp Hill station was also hit.A main line bridge near Nuneaton was badly damaged and traffic is diverted,and a goods train was derailed in Yorkshire.Military Establishments.83. . Attacks were made on the Guards camp at Pirbright and the royal marine Barracks at Deal, which caused only slight damage and a few casualties.Other Damage.84. Damage to public buildings was largely confined to Birmingham, wherethe Cathedral Church, the Town Hall, the University, Queen&apos;s College, and theGeneral Post Office all suffered, mainly by fire.. In London the Royal Hospital,Chelsea, was hit.85. Considerable damage was done to house property and shops in London,Birmingham, Coventry, Greenock, and several towns in Hampshire, Sussex andKent, especially those on the South Coast.86. A number of shelters, mostly public, have been hit. Two seriousincidents of this kind occurred in London, one at the Druid Street railway archshelter, Bermondsey, where 50 people wrere killed and 100 injured, and the otherat St. Peter&apos;s Crypt, Southwark, resulting in 18 fatal casualties and 36seriously wounded. At the latter some people are still missing (30th October, 1940).Other shelter incidents occurred in Kennington (brick), Poplar (under-ground), Battersea (trench) and Croydon (electrical showrooms used as a shelter).In Birmingham two public shelters were hit on the 24th-25th; on the 26th-27th.24 people were killed and a number buried in a public basement shelter.
Civilian Casualties.87. The approximate figures for the week ending 0600 hours, 30th October,are 829 killed and 1,379 wounded. These figures include the estimated casualtiesof 519 killed and 970 wounded in London, and 149 killed and 197 wounded in birmingham.Small German Anti-Personnel Bomb.88. On the 28th October, the enemy used for the first time against thiscountry a new small anti-personnel bomb, weighing about 41b. It was dropped in several places in East Anglia, and in Ipswich, where it was dropped apparentlyindiscriminately from a low altitude, several fatal casualties were caused. Reportsspeak of an outer case releasing a bomb which is cylindrical in shape, about-in. by 3-in., and filled with High Explosive. The wall thickness is f-in., andthe bomb may cause damage up to 50 ft. away.It is stated that the fuse is delicate and Police and Wardens have been warnedagainst handling any found unexploded.Warnings.89. London has had 27 alerts by day (of which seven were on the 26th),totalling in all some 20 hours. Night alerts in London have totalled about80 hours, the longest lasting for 12 hours 32 minutes. Liverpool and Bristol haveeach had 6 alerts by day for a total period of 5-^ and 2 hours respectively.Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol and Rugby have each had warnings at night for more than 24 hours in all.Morale.90. Morale remains consistently high both in London and the Provinces.The incidence of raiding is taken calmly and with reasoned consideration.Shelter, sleeping arrangements, evacuation, the approach and effects of winter, working hours, transport, and emergency heating and feeding arrange-ments are subjects uppermost in the public mind. In general, they are now being more thoroughly considered by the public than previously and, although calcula-tions are often not without a personal or opportunist bias, patriotism and dutyplay a larger part than earlier in the year.Unexploded Bombs.91. The number of unexploded bombs outstanding remains at about 3,000,but the position is gradually improving, since the disposal of bombs which hinderwar-effort and the community&apos;s life is becoming increasingly prompt. The totalR.E. personnel now engaged in this work is about 7,000.Civil Defence Operations.92. The services, and particularly the fire services, have been heavily engagedin Birmingham, and valuable help has been rendered by other fire services of the region and its neighbours. Inter-group reinforcement of rescue parties has alsobeen in operation. In London, though damage has not been so extensive, the cumulative effect of the raids has meant much work and a heavy strain for theworkers, for whom the question of relief is being arranged.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Berlin. Further reports have been received of damage to the Siemens Works,and the disaster which has overtaken them is said to be the main topic of conversa-tion in Berlin. Hits on the lines outside the Anhalter Station delayed traffic for24 hours, and the Excelsior Hotel opposite the Station has been hit and badly damaged. Bombs have fallen in the Lankwitz Strasse area and on the railway junction at Schoeneberg.  A large brewery has been fired.Hamburg. Six factories have been hit and four warehouses set on fire. Thefires started on the night of the 24th/25th October are stated to have been the biggest yet seen. The damage to factories and industry is daily becoming more serious, and the German Press admits that on the night of the 10th October an area of 1 kilometre was completely destroyed in two different districts of the city.Bremen. A ship in the harbour has been sunk, and travel facilities wereinterrupted through bombs on railway lines at sever a] points. One bomb fell justoutside the main station, and Guldenhaus, makers of liqueurs, received adirect hit.Essen. The Krupps Works has been badly damaged in three places. Inone of these a heavy-calibre bomb penetrated to the below-ground level plant,which was considerably damaged. The present productive capacity of the works is stated as 50 per cent, below normal.Occupied Holland.The Werkspoor factory at Amsterdam, believed to be doing work inconnection with aircraft production, was hit towards the end of August. Onebomb fell in the Power House and production was interrupted for some weeks.A munition dump in the Villa Hyde Park, between Driebergen and Doom,has been successfully attacked upon two occasions, and the small part that escapeddestruction has been removed.Occupied Belgium.A combined road and rail bridge near the station at Ostend received a direct hit and no traffic could cross for three days.Occupied France.In raids on Angers the aerodrome was successfully attacked, a number ofCadet pilots being killed, and a convent used as an Officers&apos; quarters was hit,resulting in severe casualties.
