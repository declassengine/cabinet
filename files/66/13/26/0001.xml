WAR CABINET.;:COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN - (ALLIED) ;RESISTANCEBREACH IN THE BLOCKADE OF &quot;METROPOLITAN FRANCEAND.FRENCH COLONIES.Note by the Secretary.-&apos;   The attached Memorandum&apos; based on a Paperprepared by the&quot; Economic Subcommittee (Paper No.C.F.R.(40)  79)  is being submitted to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs-.   \-::/;- (Signed)    R. EE MSSURIER......- Joint Secretary.GWydyr&apos; Rouse , &apos; S .W. 1,9th November1940..     &apos; . MEMORANDUM-.&apos; *&quot;-&quot;&apos; &quot;      The Committee feel bound&apos; once more to call attention to- the magnitude of the breach in theblockade which is toeing made at Gibraltar.     One ofthe duties of the Committee is to; apply economic pressure to the French colonies&apos; which adhere to Vichy.In the case of French West Africa and Morocco this is rendered impossible, toy the orders io the Navy not to intercept French ships in-convoy or; to ^intercept.,ships in French territorial&apos; waters.   &apos;-2, Since the&apos;middle of September at-least fiftyFrench ships - possitoly more - have passed unchallengedthrough the StraitSv.....All tout four were bound east intothe Mediterranean.     The Vichy Government have announcedthat from 15th September to 15th October more than800,000 tons of goods from North Africa, Casablanca andDakar have entered French ports.
3. There is reason to expect the opening of a line from the United States to Prance.     Ships in Casablancaare loading French merchandise for New York and shippershave been advised -that regular departures will take place :-from Casablanca to New York-.     It is reported that locomotivesare being bought in the United States to increase the capacity of the railway from Casablanca to Oran. -   SixteenFrench vessels have left St a Pierre and&quot;Miquelon for Europecarrying fish and crude cod-liver oil.     There are some200,000 tons of shipping in French West African ports, andin existing conditions there is no obstacle to their being employed, in carrying to France * and thus to Germany, the produce of the French African colonies;&apos;4a By permitting this movement-of French ships(a) we are &apos;allowing quantities of enemy deficiencycommodities such as vegetable oils, to pass to Germany j,(b) we are discouraging &quot;very much indeed&quot; our friends in North Africa and Morocco who takethe lifting of the blockade as a sign of.   weakness -.on our part;-(c) we are losing the opportunity to seize or requisition tonnage which we urgently need;(&quot;d)&quot;we. are running the risk of neutral&apos; ownerschartering to French tonnage which otherwisewe&apos; should :have obtained, or even withdrawingtonnage on whose retention we are depending;while at the same time we are being.prevented from drawing a contrast between the liberty of the de Gaulle colonies to export and import and the denial of such liberty to Lthe VichyColonies a(e)    we-are not only blunting the spear-head of ourown attack, but also strengthening^the forceof the Vichy Governments potential attack. .against the Free French colonies - or againstourselves.     Moreover, the control exercised byVichy over those /colonies which still adhere to it is being reinforced by successfulcommercial exchanges.5. The Committee appreciate the reasons which deter us from applying the blockade with the maximum rigour possiblein existing circumstances., .   They feel it, however, their duty to draw attention to the magnitude of the breach inour blockade which may not be fully realised.
