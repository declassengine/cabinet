Hgtfc (40)452. COPY NO. J84TH OCTOBER;  1940.WAR CABINET.   1&quot;ARANDORA STAR&quot;  INQUIRY.Report by Lord Snell(circulated by direction of the Prime Minister).I was appointed by the Prime Minister, by letter dated 12th August, with the following terms of reference:to inquire into the method of selection of aliens to be sent overseas in the&quot;ARANDORA STAR&quot;;    whether the actual selection of individuals was in accordance with the methoddetermined;    and generally,  the responsibilityfor the.action taken;    and to report to the WarCabinet.In conducting the inquiry I have had the assistanceof Sir Grattan Bushe, Legal Adviser to the Dominions and colonial Offices.I have taken evidence, oral or written or both, fromthe War Office and the Home Office including M. I. 5. , andfrom the Private Secretary to the Lord President of the-Council who has been associated with these and otherDepartments in the arrangements for carrying out theprogramme for the deportation of aliens.In order to understand the circumstances in whichGermans, Austrians, and Italians were embarked on the&quot;ARANDORA STAR&quot; for deportation to Canada, it is necessary,I think, constantly to bear in mind the position which thenobtained.      France had collapsed., Italy had declared warand an attempt at invasion appeared to be imminent.      On23rd May the War Office had asked for the internment of allenemy aliens and on 3rd June Lord Swinton on behalf of theHome Defence (Security) Executive had represented to theLord President the danger of retaining alien internees and prisoners of war in this country.On llth June the Minister of Home Security reportedto the War Cabinet that he was taking steps to place undercustody desperate Italian characters.      Yfhen this had beendone he would take into custody, with certain exceptions,male Italians between the age of 16 and 70.      The lord president reported at the same meeting that Canada had undertaken to receive 4,000 internees and 3,000 prisonersof war.      The figure of 4,000 would, the Lord Presidentpointed out, absorb the most dangerous characters amongstthe Germans (2500) and Italians (1500).      The War Cabinet

took note of those statements and gave general approval to theaction being taken in regard to the internment of Italians.On 21st June further reports were made to the War Cabinetregarding the arrangements for deporting internees;    the WarCabinet invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toask the Governments of the Dominions, other than Canada, whetherthey would be prepared to accept internees or prisoners of war or both and if so&quot;in what numbers.The position in the middle of June was that, broadly speaking, all male Germans, Austrians and Italians in thiscountry between the age of 16 and 70 had been interned,  that canada had undertaken to receive 4*000 internees which would absorb the estimated number of &quot;dangerous characters&quot; and that other Dominions wore being asked whether they would be preparedto accept internees.More than one witness has stated that the instructions onthe subject of deportation were not limited to deportation of&quot;dangerous characters&quot;.      I think that this is true.      Thecircumstances at the time were such that it may well have been thought desirable to remove from this country as many interneesas possible and removal might, indeed, have been in the interestof the internees themselves.      I am confirmed in my belief thatthe War Cabinet did not mean to confine deportations of interneesto dangerous characters by the fact that the Lord President in his memorandum of 2nd July made it clear that &apos; B&apos;  and *C&apos;  categorieswere being deported and the Cabinet concurred,,Turning now to the machinery for embarkation, I should explain that the actual work of collecting aliens for the boatsrested with the Prisoners of War Directorate of the War Office.Their procedure was to send the more dangerous characters first.Accordingly the first ship to sail for Canada (the &quot;Duchess ofYork&quot;) had about 2,100 Category &apos;a&apos; Germans and Austrians and 530prisoners or war on board.The &quot;ARANDORA STAR&quot; was placed at the disposal of the WarOffice on the 19th June,  the date of sailing being given as the25th June.      (The boat eventually sailed on 50th June and was torpedoed on the morning of 2nd July). :    The Germans and Austriansto be put on board were immediately selected from Category &apos;A&apos;  camps.In all, 473 Germans were embarked of whom 125 were merchant seamencaptured at sea and were treated automatically as coming underCategory &apos;Al.      The-remaining 550 had either been placed in category TA&apos; by special Tribunals appointed by the Home Office or were among those persons interned as being members of the Naziorganisation or Nazi sympathisers.All the Germans and Austrians on the &quot;ARANDORA STAR&quot; were therefore persons who had been individually ordered to be internedon grounds of national security and accordingly could properly beregarded as coming within Category &apos;A&apos;.The selection of Italians for the &quot;ARANDORA STAR&quot; presented a different problem.      Whereas the Germans had been placed in categories, the Italians had not.      Before the outbreak of war with italy, however, M.I.5 had at the request of the Home Office prepared a list of those Italians who were regarded as &quot;dangerous characters&quot;.This list was based mainly on membership of the Fascist Party.Such membership was regarded as sufficient ground for suspicion,since it Involved an oath of fidelity to the Leader and a promise toshed blood if necessary for the cause.      Moreover, reports had beenreceived that local branches of the Fascist Party had been guilty ofespionage and attempted sabotage in Canada and the Suez Canal area.

When the &quot;AliANDORA STAR&quot; was placed at the disposalof the War Office on 19th Juno, the time available forselecting internees for deportation was very short.    The boat was then duo to sail on the 25th.    In order that the necessary arrangements for railway travelling etc., could be completed in time, it was essential that the schedule of deportees forthe &quot;ARANDORA STAR&quot; should be available on 22nd Juno.A copy of the M.I.5 list of &quot;dangerous&quot; Italianswas sent to each of the five camps concerned and the CampCommandants were instructed to mark for deportation any personnamed on the list who mi-lit be in their&quot; camp.    The lists, which contain-d a boat 1,500 names, could not be dolivorod to the camps until about 21st June.    A period of only about 24 hoarswas therefore available for identifying the Italians for deportation.    The difficulties were increased by the factthat a number of Italian names have alternative spellings.There is, too, reason to suspect that in ono or two casesan Italian who wished to get out of the country impersonateda man whose name appeared on the M.I.5. list.    Be that asit may, subsequent scrutiny showed that out of 717 Italiansappearing on the embarkation list of the &quot;ARANDORA STAR&quot; the names of 26 did not coincide with names on the M.I.5. list.In about a dozen of these cases, however, the names -are sosimilar as to aiggest that the persons embarked were in factpersons whose name appeared in the M.I.5. list.It will bo observed that, in selecting the more dangerous characters for early deportation, the War Office hadto rely entirely, so far as Italians wore concerned, on a listof persons drawn up mainly on the basis of membership of the fascist Party.    None of these Italians had any opportunityof appealing to a Tribunal against their classification.    Inso far as importance can be attached to the procedure of sending &quot;dangerous characters&quot; first, I cannot regard themethod of selecting &quot;dangerous&quot; Italians as satisfactory.I realise, however, that under the conditions prevailing at the time of the declaration of war by Italy it was important that the work of deporting aliens should proceed without delay and that there was no alternative but to classifythe Italians on such information as was already available.I have delayed the conclusion of this inquiry in orderto see whether I could obtain from the Home Office particulars of any complaints which might have been made by relativesof persons on the &quot;ARANDORA STAR&quot;, but none have been produced, and the only cases to which my attention has been drawn are certain cases which were raised in the House ofCommons and dealt with by the Homo Secretary.CONCLUSIONS.The War Cabinet laid down no definite instructions asto the method of selecting aliens to be sent overseas on the&quot;ARANDORA STAR&quot; and other&apos;boats.    This statement requiressome amplification.Following the invasion of the Low Countries, the   WarCabinet,  on strong representations from the military authorities,gave instructions that a large number of enemy aliens shouldbe interned within a very short period of time.    In theconditions prevailing in this country in May and June, it was felt that to keep largo numbers of aliens in this country, eveniza internment camps, presented a. grave danger to tho public safety, and the policy of sending internees overseas wasdecided upon.    I think it is clear that the underlying idea

was that the first stage, at any rate, would be to send out of this country those aliens who wore proved orknown to be dangerous characters,.    It would not,however, be right to say that the orders issued overlaid it down that only aliens who could be described as dangerous characters were to be sent overseas. /Further, the need for speedy action, and for sendingaliens overseas in large numbers, was repeatedlyemphasised in Mihutes from the Prime Minister calling for periodic reports on the progress achieved.The War Office, in collecting internees for deportation, did in fact proceed on the principlethat the more dangerous characters should be the first to be deported.All the Germans and Austrians on the &quot;ARAITDORASTAR&quot; had been classified as Category &apos;A&apos;, and I see no reason to question the machinery of classification.In the case of the Italians, no classificationby Tribunals had taken place, and there was no alternative but to work on such material as was already available, i*e.  the material in the possession ofM.I.5.The responsibility for the compilation of lists5f dangerous Italians rested with the Branch known asM.I.-5., and, as time did not permit of furtherscrutiny, these lists were accepted as being the equivalent of the Category &apos;A&apos;  Germans and Austrians.The lists were largely based on membership of the fascist Party, which was the ohly evidence againstmany of these persons.    M.I,5. apparently took theview that those who had been only nominal members ofthe Fascist Party, and those who were ardently Fascist,were equally dangerous.    The result was that, among those deported, were a number of men whose sympathieswere wholly with this country.    I cannot regard thislack of discrimination as satisfactory, and I thinkthat M.I.5. must bear some of the responsibilityfor the results which followed their decision.Among the Italians deported was Signor Anzani,who had lived in England for 20 years and was theSecretary of the Italian Section of the League of theRights of Men.    His name, however, had been placed onthe M. 1.5. list in error, as he was not a member of the fascist Party.In compiling the embarkation lists of Italiansit seems likely that errors occurred in about a dozencases.    These errors were due largely to the fact thatthe work was carried out under great pressure.    Taking   *the broad view of the programme of deportation5 I donot consider that this number of errors is a cause for serious criticism.(Signed) SHELL.34th&apos;October, 19.40.
