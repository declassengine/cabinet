2.   Personnel of the Free French Force is now : 175 Officers54 Aspirants376 Pettv Officers2,540 RatingsTotal      ......      3,145Increase during October, 660.3. Discipline and Morale. Varies considerably, depending to a largeextent on the qualities of individual commanding officers. In general, discipline in ships not yet actively employed, is. moderate by our standards; considerable improvement is hoped for when these ships begin active operations. discipline in submarines is good, particularly so in the Rubis, the only one so far employedon operations.4. Attitude to Leaders, (fee-There is universal respect for, and confidence in, General de Gaulle. The action at Dakar does not seem to have had an adverse effect on his prestige or on morale generally. His decision to avoidfighting between Frenchmen is approved.5. Respect for Admiral Muselier is increasing.. Information has recentlybeen received from a senior pro-Vichy officer that when the Admiral first came to support General de Gaulle, rts were made by Vichy French to discredithim in both French and British eyes by means of adverse stories, propaganda, &amp;c.These efforts had considerable initial success. Relations between Admiral Muselier and British naval authorities are increasingly satisfactory.6. There is general and growing contempt for the Vichy leaders, particularly for Laval.; : 7. Officers and men seem to have a good grasp of the true facts about thepresent situation in France, and to approve our attitude to the Vichy Govern-ment. The Prime Ministers recent broadcast to France was greatly appreciated.British successes, especially against the Italians, are warmly welcomed.8. There do not appear to be any serious complaints or grievances. definite information about family allowances and pensions is eagerly awaited. It wouldbe satisfactory if this matter could be settled soon.9. Men of the F.N.F.L. are not well disposed towards their compatriots inthe Royal Navy; their feelings are reciprocated.10. Five men of the Leopard put out 23 incendiary bombs in a recent raidon Portsmouth, using their clothes to do so. They then proceeded to assist the fire Brigade.11.   Extract from a letter written by a Free French sailor at Portsmouth :-&quot; I am firmly convinced that by May we shall cross Paris, pass underthe Arc de Triomphe and sweep Paris clean of the German &quot; jack-boot &quot; !We shall meet again all those for whom we are prepared to lose our lives.We shall exact a reckoning for those who have condemned us.&quot;French Officers and Men in the Royal Navy.12. There are just under 600 Frenchmen in the Royal Navy. The smallflow of volunteers to transfer to the Free French Force continues and isencouraged. Some applications are received for transfer in the reverse direction;these are only allowed in very exceptional circumstances.13. The great majority of officers and men have taken British names, wishto be considered British and do not want to serve in French ships or under theFrench flag. They much prefer serving under British officers, for whom theyhave a respect which French officers do not seem able to command. The officersof the Free French Force are regarded with mistrust, particularly those who havebeen promoted rapidly from the lower deck and junior ranks. The Vichy Govern-ment is referred to with disgust and the opinion is widely held that those whoare not for us are against us.
14. Morale and discipline are good with rare exceptions. There are fewcomplaints, and, in fact, gratitude is often expressed for the treatment the menare receiving.French in Camps.15. Nearly all the officers have recently been removed from the camps and sent to hotels and billets in the Isle of Man. This measure has had an immediatelybeneficial effect on the spirit and discipline of the men, and on recruiting for theFree French Force. There is no doubt that the great majority of the officers are strongly pro-Vichy. They have never taken any interest in the welfare of theirmen, and have concentrated their efforts on blackguarding the British and theFree French leaders, and on preventing recruiting. Some senior officers protestedviolently against the move to the Isle of Man, various specious arguments being-advanced to conceal the true one their well-founded fear of increased recruitingin their absence (the senior executive officer admitted this frankly in conversation).(ii) Army.16.   Camberley.   Strength Foreign Legion : 7 Officers and 91 Other Ranks.Remainder : 53 Officers and 693 Other Ranks.Training.
