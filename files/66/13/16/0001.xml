The following is a brief summary of hid proposals,(see Annex): (a) Reaffirmation by China, Great Britain arid the United States of the open Door principle and opposition to Japan&apos;s &quot; New Order in greater East Asia.&quot;(b) Joint Anglo-American declaration in favour of a free and independentChina and an undertaking to give the utmost help to maintain China&apos;ssovereignty and territorial and administrative integrity and to restorepeaceful relations among the nations in the Ear East.(c) Anglo-Chinese alliance; United States adherence, or at least approval to be sought.(d) Joint or separate loans by Great Britain and the United States to Chinatotalling between 200 and 300 million dollars (i.e., at the official rate, 50- 75 million). (N.B. The Chinese Ambassador put in a similarproposal for loans and credits by His. Majesty&apos;s Government totalling 10 million, partly for currency stabilisation and partly for export credits in the sterling area.)(e) The provision of 500-1,000 aircraft per annum, of which 200-300 shouldbe Supplied this year.(/) Military, economic and communications missions whose members mightbe appointed by the Chinese Government as advisers.(g) If Grd&amp;t Britain or the United States become involved in war with Japanthe Chinese army to participate and all aerodroriies to be placed atthe disposal of the Allied Forces.2. Chiang Kai-shek has indicated, in putting forward his proposals, thatthe effect of Japanese air raids this summer and of price inflation is so serious that unless he receives assistance from the United States and this country he will11208   [21903]
be unable to maintain bis resistance to Japan beyond the end of this year, and china will have to extricate herself from her difficulties as best she can.   .;3. In view of the increasing pressure of Japan on Indo-China and othersigns of preparations for a move southwards against British and Dutch territoryit is in our vital interests that Chinese resistance should be maintained. I take it that we should therefore wish to help her so far as we can without provokingreactions on the part of Japan such as might lead to war. It.should be remem-bered that any help we ourselves might be able to give China would be welcome to the United&apos; States and might increase their disposition to help us in the far east.4. I have reached the following general conclusions on Chiang Kai-shek&apos;sproposals after consultation with the principal Departments concerned : (a), (b) and (c) (Reaffirmation of the Open Door principle, Anglo-Americandeclaration and Anglo-Chinese alliance). It is idle to expect thatthe United States will take a definite commitment at this stage, anda tripartite alliance is therefore ruled out. An Anglo-Chinese alliancewould not serve the same purpose and its reactions on Japan wouldbe out of proportion to its utility. Declarations on the lines suggestedmight conceivably be arranged, though the United States would belikely to make any such declaration independently. The declarationsproposed, except in regard to giving the utmost help to China, coverground which has already been covered by various statements made byHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government. I thinktherefore that more practical help on the points enumerated belowshould precede the consideration of any such declarations.(d) (Loans by Great Britain and the United States). -Sums as large as those mentioned by General Chiang Kai-shek are out of the question unless\ the United States are willing to provide the lion&apos;s share.   The more\ modest suggestion made by the Chinese Ambassador for a currencystabilisation loan and export credits does not present any insuperable difficulty, and it is indeed one of the few things that we can do.   Aj stabilisation loan would have to be made conditional on satisfactory/ arrangements being worked out as to the use to which the sterlingadvanced might be put.   Export credits from the United Kingdompresent the difficulty that China&apos;s immediate needs can only be,supplied at the expense of our own war effort, but the possibility offurnishing her with other material she requires from the Empire and allied countries within the sterling area is being studied.(e) (Supply of aircraft). Ft is impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government toprovide aeroplanes, and the most modern production of the UnitedStates is entirely absorbed either by the United States or by our own requirements. There would be no objection, however, from the UnitedKingdom point of view if the United States were able to supply Chinawith less modern aircraft not covered by our orders.(f) (Military, economic and communications missions). I would not press for the despatch of a full-dress military mission at this stage whichis considered undesirable, but some improved military co-operationcould be effected by replacing the present Military Attache to China bya more senior officer and by expanding his staff. These officers couldenter into unobtrusive discussions with the Chinese. Meanwhile,plans can be prepared for a full military mission in case of the out-break of hostilities.I would not favour the despatch of economic or communicationsmissions unless and until definite arrangements are made for theprovision of concrete help.   Thereafter, however, technical expertsmight be sent out as required by the Chinese Government to deal.with/   specific questions. , , ..(g) (Chinese participation in Anglo-American-Japanese This is, ofcourse, very desirable, but the support which could be afforded by theChinese army should not be overrated. It would be likely to be confined to guerrilla warfare.
-. 5. To sum up, if China&apos;s resistance to Japan is to continue, General&apos;&apos;Chiang Kai-shek needs  &quot; &apos; &apos;&apos;     &apos;  * r&quot;*&apos;(1) a demonstration of Anglo-American solidarity with China as a meansof reviving morale;- ., -      ,    w,(2) concrete financial and economic help;   :   - ; ;(3) technical advice,6. The Far Eastern Committee are in agreement with the following recommendations:-(1) That we should offer China a loan for currency purposes and a credit tocover exports from the sterling area.(2) That we should do this without waiting for&apos; any possible Anglo-American declarations. &apos;7. If my colleagues were prepared to agree in principle to sanction sucha loan and credit, it would be desirable to invite Mr. T. V. Soong, Chairman ofthe Bank of China and the National Resources Commission, who is now inAmerica, to come to England to discuss details. This invitation cannot beextended unless it is clear that, subject to technical discussion, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are prepared to grant financial assistance to China.8. If the above recommendations are approved, it will be necessary toensure Dominion concurrence before our proposals are communicated to theChinese, both because of possible reactions in Japan and because in practice theChinese will wish to obtain supplies under the export credit from Empiresources.  The Government of India must also be/consulted.H.Foreign Office, November 10, 1940.ANNEX.Sir A. Clark Kerr to Viscount Halifax.-- (Received November 5.)(No. 160.   Important.)(Telegraphic.)
