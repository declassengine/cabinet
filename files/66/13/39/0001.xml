THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 439.November 22, 1940. /to BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It Is requested that special care may be taken to &apos; &apos;ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.COASTAL COMMAND.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I GIVE below the replies of the Admiralty to the Prime Ministersquestionnaire about the Coastal Command (W.P. (40) 458).A.-What complaints have the Admiralty against the present system?(1) The Admiralty have no voice in the design and equipment of aircraft ofthe Coastal Command which operate over the sea in conjunction with .M. Ships.(2) The Admiralty have no voice in the operational training of coastal command.(3) The Admiralty have no responsibility for the day-to-day operational control of Coastal Command aircraft which are carrying out what are essentially Naval operations.(4) Numbers in Coastal Command are inadequate.(5) Although the number of aircraft in Coastal Command is totally inadequate, the Air Ministry can under present arrangements deflecteven the small force that exists from its naval purposes without evenconsulting the Admiralty.B. (1) What operational advantages would there be over the present system ifthe Coastal Command were absorbed into the Fleet Air Arm?The success of the present scheme depends on the co-operation of two services which can never be relied upon to the same extent as with unifiedcontrol.(2) Would the various stages in the training of pilots and crews best be managedin Royal Naval or in Royal Air Force training establishments?The Admiralty consider that in principle the training of all pilots andair gunners for the Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm should be underNaval control, but for practical reasons at the present time they considerthat the system at present in force whereby the R.A.F. train all pilots in the initial and Service flying stages should continue until aerodromes, aircraft,instructors and maintenance staff are available.As regards Observers for Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm, it isclearly desirable that they should have a common training, and the ideal tobe aimed at is for the Navy to train them all. This is a long-term project and would involve the formation or transfer of all G.R. Observers&apos; training schools and aircraft used therein from R.A.F. to the Royal Navy, who arenot yet in a position to provide the requisite numbers of Instructors.[21949]
What would be the effect of the change on the provision of men and aircraft ?Would there be any net increase of resources?The answer to this question will depend on the extent to which theMinistry of Aircraft Production is able to supply us with British and/ar american aircraft without undue interference with RAP. supplies.As regards personnel, we should hope to be able to produce an increased number of recruits for training for the Naval Air Service, but there mightbe difficulty in providing an increased number of trained maintenancepersonnel.On the whole, we consider that it is likely there would be a gain in netresources.How would an increase of &quot; overheads &quot; and an overlapping of functions between the R.A.F. and the F.A.A. be avoided?On the assumption that the Air Ministry would turn over to theAdmiralty the whole organisation and personnel who now serve coastal command, there should be no increase in overheads.Overlapping of functions need not occur between the RAP. and fleet air Arm provided the functions of aircraft are clearly defined; for instance.&quot;it would be uneconomical to use long-range fighters for work that could bedone by short-range fighters, i.e., convoys within 30 miles of the coast, and defence of shore bases must remain the responsibility of the fighter command.How could an undue diversion of resources to defensive duties owing to thedesire of the F.A.A. to ensure its requirements being met on an over-generous scale be best avoided ?We recognise that, with the limited resources available, it is essentialthat the target of expansion of shore-based aircraft for the Naval Air Servicemust be clearly defined and approved by the War Cabinet for the task it hasto fulfil.What would be the minimum number of aircraft the A dmiralty would requireto be provided within the next twelve months ?The Admiralty&apos;s endeavour would be to get as near the figure for homerequirements stated in Appendix &quot; A &quot; as was practicable in the 12 months,together with such additions to Gibraltar, Alexandria, Freetown, the Capeand Singapore, as could be managed.-// the suggested transfer zvere not carried out, what improvements could bemade, within the framework of the present organisation, to increase theresources available to Coastal Command, and to bring the co-operationbetween the latter and the Royal Navy to the highest pitch of efficiency ?If the suggested transfer were not carried out, it is considered that no improvement could be made in the already excellent co-operation which exists between Coastal Command and the Royal Navy, except by arranging for the coastal Command staff to work in close contact with the Admiralty staff inthe Admiralty building.Methods of increasing the resources of Coastal Command have beensuggested by the Admiralty in War Cabinet Paper W.P. (40) 455 of the20th November.A. V. A.Admiralty, November 22, 1940.
