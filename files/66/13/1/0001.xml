THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1940.MOST SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 421.(Also C.O.S. (40) 833.)October 15, 1940.TO BE KEPT  UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE MEDITERRANEAN.Copy of a Minute from the Prime Minister to the Chiefs of Staff Committee.1.   FIRST in urgency is the reinforcement of Malta :  (a) by further Hurricane aircraft flown there as can best be managed.(&amp;) by the convoy now being prepared, which should carry the largest anti-aircraft outfit possible, as well as tihe Battalion and the Battery.I understand another M.T. ship can be made available.(c) by One or better still two more Battalions released from police duty onthe Canal or in Palestine, and carried to Malta when next the Eleetmoves thither from Alexandria. General Bobbie&apos;s latest appreciationbears out the grievous need of strengthening the garrison. Everyeffort should be made to meet his needs, observing that once Maltabecomes a thorn in the Italian side, the enemy&apos;s force may be turnedupon it. The movement of these reinforcements should, therefore,precede any marked activity from Malta.(d) Even three I. Tanks at Malta would be important, not only in actualdefence, but as a deterrent if it were known that they were there.Some mock-up Tanks also might be exhibited where they would bedetected from the Air.[21821]
2. The movement of the Fleet to Malta must await this strengthening ofthe A.A. and Air defences. It is, however, a most needful and profoundlyadvantageous step. I welcome the possibility of even basing light Forces uponMalta, as they immediately increase its security. I understand it is intended they shall sally forth by day and only lie in harbour as a rule at night. It must be observed that a strong ship like the Valiant can far better withstand a hit froma bomb than light craft, and, in addition, she brings a Battery of 20 very high-class A.A. guns. Apart from the stake being higher, it is not seen why, iflight Forces can be exposed in Malta Harbour, well-armoured and well-armedships cannot use it, too. The multiple aerial mine U.P. weapon gives considerablesecurity against dive-bombing.I should be glad to be more fully informed by the Admiralty about this.Occasional visits by the whole Battle Fleet would be an immense deterrenton hostile attack, and also a threat to the Libyan communications while theylasted.Let me have the number of AA. guns now in position, and the wholemaximum contents of the new convoy, together with estimated dates for their being mounted.3. Relations ivith Vichy. We cannot accept the position that we mustyield to the wishes of Vichy out of fear, lest they make Air raids upon Gibraltar;for there would be no end to that. We must reassert our blockade of the Straits,dealing with vessels whether escorted or unescorted, though without violatingSpanish Territorial waters. We should assemble a sufficient force at Gibraltarfor this purpose at the earliest date possible. Meanwhile, we must maintain asgood a blockade of Dakar as possible, and protect Duala, &amp;o, from a counter-strokeby the French cruisers in Dakar. The conversations with Vichy, if they takeplace, may reach a modus vivendi, falling somewhat short of these desiderata. Ofcourse, if we could be assured that Vichy, or part of Vichy, were genuinelymoving in our direction, we could ease up on them to a very large extent. It seems probable that they will be increasingly inclined to move as we desire, and I personally do not believe that hard pressure from us will prevent this favourablemovement. It is becoming more difficult every day for Vichy to lead France into war with us. We must not be too much afraid of checking this process, becausethe tide in our favour will master and overwhelm the disturbing eddies of theblockade, De Gaulle, and possible sea incidents. I do not believe that anytrouble will arise with the French which will prevent the impending movementof our convoy to Malta.   The chance is there, but it is remote and must be faced.I agree with the Admiralty suggestion that, if unhappily Vichy shouldattack Gibraltar again by air, we should reply by attacking not Casablanca, butVichy itself, or any other place to which that caitiff Government might resort.4. The greatest prize open to the Bomber Command is the disabling ofBismarck and Tirpitz. If Bismarck could be set back for three or four months,the K.G.V. could go to the Eastern Mediterranean to work up, and could there-

Should October pass without invasion, which cannot yet be assumed,we should begin the reinforcement of the Middle East by the Cape route to theutmost extent our shipping permits, sending as arranged the Armoured Units,the Australians and New Zealanders in November, another British Divisionbefore Christmas, and at least 4 more during January, February and March.All this would be in addition to the necessary drafts. Let me know how faryour present programme of sailings conforms to this.6. The time has also come for a further strong reinforcement of the middle east by Bombers and by Fighters. I should be glad to know how far the Chiefsof the Staff would be prepared to go, observing that, though the risk is verygreat, so also is the need.7. Let me see the programme for reinforcing the Mediterranean Fleetduring the next six months. It should be possible by the end of the year to sendtwo flotillas of destroyers to the Eastern Mediterranean, and one additional to gibraltar. If K.G. V. must be kept to watch Bismarck, Nelson or Rodney should go to Alexandria and either Barham or Queen Elizabeth. What cruiser reinforce-ments are contemplated? Will it be possible to send Formidable thither alsoand when %8. Agreeably to the dispatch of Divisions to the Middle East, the HomeArmy and the Home Guard will be developed to fill the gap. A minimum of12 Mobile Divisions must lie in reserve, apart from the troops on the beaches,at any time.9. It should be possible also to provide by the end of July a striking force for amphibious warfare of 6 Divisions, of which 2 should be Armoured. Thevarious alternative plans for the employment of such a Force are being studied.w. s. c.
