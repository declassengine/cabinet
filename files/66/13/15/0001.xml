ICabinet War Room
General Review.An enemy raider, described as a Pocket Battleship, has attacked a Convoyin mid-Atlantic.In the early part of the week shipping in the Thames Approaches and theStraits of Dover was heavily attacked by aircraft, and German shore batteriesopened fire on trawlers without effect.Enemy minelaying round our East and South Coasts has caused a number of minor casualties.Another U-Boat has been sunk in the North-Western Approaches.Home Waters.2. On the 1st November minesweeping trawlers off Dover were heavilyshelled by enemy shore batteries, about 200 rounds being fired without result.On the same afternoon, during a dive-bombing attack on shipping in the thames estuary, ELM. Trawler Tilburyness and the East Oaze Light Vessel were sunk and the Mid-Barrow Light Vessel was bombed and machine-gunned.H.M. Drifters proceeding on patrol from Dover were also attacked, the Tarbay IIbeing sunk. A German hospital towing-barge, fitted with four bunks andbedding and well equipped as a hospital carrier, stranded near Seaford. Onthe 4th November H.M. Submarine L. 27 was seriously damaged by an under-water collision while on patrol off Cherbourg, but was able to reach Portsmouththe next day. Pour of the crew were wounded when H.M. Drifter Reids was attacked by aircraft in the Thames Estuary on the 5th.3. On the 1st November H.M. Corvette Pintail, on escort duty off Yarmouth,was bombed and seriously damaged, but was able to proceed to Lowestoft. Therewere nine killed, including the Captain, and ten injured. During the nightH.M. Trawler Shirley drove off an E-Boat, which was probably minelaying offAldeburgh. H.M. Destroyer Ashanti, which ran ashore off the Tyne on the17th October, has been refloated and docked at Sunderland. The aircraft carrierFormidable was commissioned at Belfast on the 31st October.4. Mines have caused the following casualties. On the East Coast M.T.B. 16was sunk and M.T.B. 22 was damaged in the Thames Estuary on the 31st October.H.M. Sloop Black Swan seriously damaged her engines in the Rosyth Approacheson the 1st November. H.M. Destroyer Intrepid was damaged off Hartlepool onthe 2nd, and the auxiliary patrol vessel George and Annie was sunk in the samevicinity on the following day. H.M. Trawler Elgin was damaged off Harwich,and the dan laying drifter Girl Helen was sunk off the Tyne on the 6th. On theSouth Coast H.M. Trawlers Rinovia and Sevra were sunk off Falmouth on the2nd and 6th respectively, and the A/S Motor Boat No. 4 off Fowey on the 4th.H.M. Trawler Radnor Castle and patrol vessel IVIedoc were damaged and beachedoff Plymouth.North Atlantic.5. Between 2200 and 2300 on the 3rd November, H.M. Armed merchant cruisers Laurentic and Patroclus, returning from the Atlantic patrol, were torpedoed and sunk 150 miles west of Ireland. Destroyers rescued 52 officers and316 ratings from the Laurentic and 33 officers and 230 ratings from the Patroclus.6. At 1955 on the 5th November a homeward bound Convoy from Halifax,escorted by H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Jervis Bay, reported that it was being attacked in mid-Atlantic by an enemy raider described as a Pocket Battleship.Up to the present nothing further has been heard from these ships since theBritish s.s. Beaverford reported that she was being shelled at 2147, two other ships in the Convoy having made similar reports at 1955 and 2005. Steps havebeen taken to postpone the sailing of further Convoys and divert others already at sea, and units of the Fleet in home and south Atlantic waters have been disposed to intercept and cover the trade routes. The Convoy consists of 38 ships,26 of which are British, and principal cargoes include eleven of oil, seven of steel,amd four of lumber.
Norway.7. H.M. Submarine Sturgeon, while on patrol off the south coast of Norway,sank two supply ships of 2,000 and 1,200 tons on the 3rd and 6th Novemberrespectively.Mediterranean.8. From the 30th October to the 1st November troops and guns were landedand net defences established at Suda Bay in Crete. While this operation wasin progress the Fleet was at sea off the west coast of Greece as far north asCephalonia, but no enemy ships were sighted, though enemy aircraft were observed occasionally. One of these was shot down by our fighters and anotherdamaged. Two destroyers were detached to visit Navarino Bay. On the1st November enemy aircraft made an ineffective attack on Suda Bay.9. In the Eastern Mediterranean various units of the French Fleet havebeen reported passing through the Straits of Gibraltar. On the 31st Octoberfive destroyers passed westward shadowed by a force of our capital ships and destroyers from Gibraltar. The Destroyer Milan passed Gibraltar westboundon the morning of the 3rd November and later the same day a minesweepingsloop escorting four submarines and two merchant ships passed Eastward. four destroyers passed eastward on the 4th November. A destroyer escorting theFrench merchant ship Marechal Lyautey and another destroyer escorting themerchant ships Capitaine Paul Lemerle and Arizona passed eastward on the5th November.10. On the 3rd November an Italian U-Boat was reported to have enteredTangier chased by three of our destroyers and on the following day anotherItalian U-Boat arrived. A patrol has been established to seaward. It is under-stood that both of these U-Boats have been damaged and had been operating inthe Atlantic.11. H.M. Destroyer Encounter and H.M. Submarine Utmost were in collision 140 miles west of Gibraltar on the 6th and will require to be docked.South Atlantic.12. On the 31st October ELM. Armed Merchant Cruiser Moreton Bayintercepted the French Ship Cuba (11,337 tons) bound from Martinique andescorted her to Freetown. The ship was carrying naval and military personnel and had a cargo of rice and soya beans.Red Sea.13. On the 2nd November ELM. Destroyer Kimberley was unsuccessfullybombed in the Southern Red Sea, and at the same time bombs were dropped on and near Perim, but no damage has been reported. A northbound supply Convoyescorted by two cruisers was bombed ineffectively on the 4th November, theaircraft being driven off in a damaged condition by our escorting aircraft.Anti-Submarine Operations.14. On the 2nd November H.M. Destroyer Antelope made a successful attack on U-31 in a position 110 miles W.N.W. of Malin Head. The U-Boatcame to the surface and was abandoned, but Antelope was unable to prevent her from sinking, and sustained slight damage, in trying to get alongside. Fiveofficers and 38 ratings were taken prisoner.15. H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Salopian engaged a U-Boat on the surface in a position 450 miles W.S.W. of the Fastnet. The U-Boat submergedafter Salopian opened fire.16. On the morning of the 6th the British S.S. Melrose Abbey reported thatshe was being chased by a U-Boat in a position 270 miles West of the Fastnet,and during the evening ELM- Canadian Destroyer Ottawa and ELM. DestroyerHarvester attacked a firm contact in this position.17. It is now known that the U-Boat sunk last week in the North-western approaches was U-32, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Jenisch, who is&apos;one of the better-known U-boat commanders.[21894] - B
18. H.M. Submarine Clyde has made a belated report that she unsuccess-fully attacked a U-Boat about 540 miles W.N.W. of the Bloody Foreland on the17th October, and on the next clay, while on the same patrol, sighted the conning-tower of a U-Boat breaking surface, but lost contact before an attack could becarried out.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.19. During the period 26,401 tons of shipping has been sank by enemy action and in addition 7 ships (30,688 tons) have been included which were sunkpreviously but not reported, making a total of 57,089 tons. Two British ships(12,369 tons) were sunk by U-Boats in the North-Western Approaches and oneSwedish ship was sunk by an Italian U-Boat off the Azores. Casualties frommines amounted to onlv 1,518 tons. Two British (5,194 tons) and 1 Greek ship(4,202 tons) were sunk by aircraft.20. Shipping in the Thames Estuary was attacked by dive-bombers on the1st November and on the next day a northbound convoy was attacked four timesoff Harwich without result. Several single aircraft attacked a convoy from the clyde off Rattray Head on the evening of the 3rd, one ship being sunk andanother damaged. Channel convoys were twice shelled by shore batteries duringthe week but no damage was inflicted. S.S. Windsor Castle homeward boundfrom Durban was bombed in the North-Western Approaches but arrived in the clyde with only minor damage. A 500-lb. unexploded bomb was safely removedon her arrival.21. On the 5th November, 24 miles north-west of Scapa, the British trawlerCaspian was damaged by a near miss bomb. The form of attack appears novel.An aircraft at first thought to be British was observed approaching from S.S.W.and flying at over 2,000 feet. As the aircraft approached it paid out a wireon the end of which was suspended a cylindrical object estimated as being4 or 5 feet long, 1 foot in diameter with conical ends and grey in colour. Theaircraft appeared to dive on the trawler, passing over her at about 500 feettowing the object which it is estimated passed between foremast and funnel at aheight of 50 feet. It struck the water about 100 yards beyond the ship on theport side and exploded, causing some damage including a leak.Protection of Seaborne Trade.22. Seven hundred and eighty ships, &quot;mcluiimgH^were convoyed during the week ending noon the 6th November, of which fivewere lost by enemy action. In addition, one British ship recorded last week assunk has arrived in port damaged. Since the start of hostilities 137 British,18 Allied and 13 Neutral, a total of 168 ships have been lost out of 42,471 ships,including 4,266 Allied and 4,100 Neutral which have been convoyed. ThirteenArmed Merchant Cruisers, 49 Destroyers, 14 sloops and 26 corvettes were employed on escort duty during the period under review.23. Imports by ships in convoy during the week ending the 2nd Novembertotalled 1,129,655 tons compared with 842,753 tons during the previous week.Mineral imports were 282,680 tons, of which 198,287 tons were steel, scrap iron,pig iron and iron ore. Twenty-seven tankers brought 291,390 tons of oil ofvarious grades compared with 172,077 tons in sixteen tankers during the previousweek. Timber and pulp imports were 112,786 tons and cereal imports were171,705 tons, 18 ships being fully loaded with grain. Other food imports were103,339 tons, of which 37,651 tons were sugar, 16,469 tons were refrigerated andtinned meats, bacon and ham, 10,728 tons were tea and 1,485 tons were fruit.Large quantities of rubber, cotton, trucks, machinery and high explosives were included in the general cargoes.Enemy Intelligence.German.24. The disposition of the main German Units remains as before exceptthat the raider which was reported attacking a convoy in mid-Atlantic was described as a battleship, and may be presumed to be the&quot; Admiral Scheer as the
only other German ship of that description--Lutzow was seen in dry dock onthe 21st October.25. Reports have been received that the two old Battleships Schlesien andSchleswig-IIolstein are stationed at Gydnia for training purposes and that a cruiser with two funnels, either the Koln or the Emden, was seen passingCopenhagen on the 28th October, but there is no confirmation of these reports.26. It is estimated that there are five or six effective destroyers in Germanhome waters. Two were believed to be completing at Bremen on the 28th October,but the two which had been there on the 21st October had left.27. An unconfirmed report states that five modern destroyers were at Osloon the 2nd November. It is believed that there are eight destroyers stationed at Brest.28. The enemy continues to maintain about five submarines in the North-West Approaches.Italian.29. At the beginning of the week the disposition of the Italian main unitswas as follows: Taranto, five battleships, twelve cruisers and thirty-four destroyers; at Brindisi, six cruisers, including the BaH and Taranto, and twelvedestroyers. There have been some slight movements, but in general.the positionremains unchanged. The air reconnaissance on the 6th November was, however,incomplete and did not include Brindisi.30. There has been one Italian submarine at work in the Azores areathroughout the week. Two Italian submarines have taken refuge in Tangier.The first, which arrived at 1750 on the 3rd November, is reported to be of theCalvi Class or later, and to be seriously damaged. The second, a smaller ship,arrived at 1800 on the 4th November but there is no report of the extent of herdamage and it was thought possible that she might leave on the night of the6th-7th November.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.31. Up to the 5th November, 227 German merchant ships, of a total of1,137,639 tons, have been either sunk or scuttled.32. A Norwegian broadcast announced that the Norwegian ship PrinsesseRagnhild, 1,590 tons, was mined and sunk off Haugesund on the 25th October.She was carrying on a coastal trade and is reported to have had more than300 passengers on board.33. There is evidence that larger German ships are again being employedin the Baltic trade. Since June, trade had been confined to German ships of less than 1,600 tons or to Finnish or Russian ships. Two German ships of over4,000 tons are now known to be carrying timber from Russia to Germany.34. H.M. Submarine Taku has reported that she attacked and estimatedthree hits on a large inward-bound tanker some 35 miles south-west of Belle Isle.This may have been the Gedania, 8,923 tons, which left Las Palmas early inOctober, with a cargo of 9,000 tons of whale oil, and was expected to arrive at st.. Nazaire at the end of October.35. The Usaramo, 7,775 tons, which left Vigo on the 22nd October andcalled at Corcubion Bay the next day and at Pasajes on the 28th October, is now,presumably, in a French port. On the 4th November three of her officers were reported to be in Vigo and they have probably returned there for the purposeof taking another ship.36. At Vigo the tanker Brake, 9,925 tons, completed the transference of200 tons of lubricating oil to the tanker Nord A atlantic, 9,897 tons, on the30th October, and the Brake and La Plata, 8,056 tons, have both taken provisions on board.37. The Stormarn, 1,459 tons, was reported to be preparing to leave Bilbaoon the 1st November with a cargo of iron ore, and to be bound for Bayonne.
38. On the 31st October the Larissa, 1,819 tons, arrived.at Galatz fromRussia with 2,900 tons of manganese ore, and two other German ships left that port in ballast for Russia.39. The Kulmerland, 7,363 tons, which left her moorings at Kobe on the9th October, has now been located in a Kobe shipyard, renamed the Tesyo Maruand transferred to the Japanese flag. It is rumoured that the Burgenland,7,320 tons, will also be transferred to the Japanese flag. It has been reported bySingapore that broadcasts from Japan and Manila on the 30th October included the statement that the Scharnhorst, 18,184 tons, was armed and ready for sea.40. It was reported on the 4th November that the Cerigo, 1,120 tons,13 knots, had received orders to provision and to leave Guayaquil, Ecuador,without papers.   She is said to be going to Japan.41. The Helgoland, 3,664 tons, which left Puerto, Colombia, on the28th October, it was thought for Martinique, was later reported to be shapinga course for San Domingo and to be disguising herself as a Dutch ship. It wasthen reported that she had scuttled herself and that the crew were on board a japanese ship bound for New York, but no confirmation of this story has beenreceived.Italian,42. Up to the 5th November 73 Italian merchant ships, of a total of370,661 tons, have been either sunk or scuttled.43. The Edera, 5,254 tons, left Corunna on the 29th October, arriving atFerrol the same day. The tanker Celeno, 3,741 tons, arrived at Varna on the25th October with 5,000 tons of petroleum. She is believed to have come fromBatum. Another tanker, the Torcello, 3,336 tons, is also at Varna with a similaramount of petroleum. A third tanker, the Maya, 3,867 tons, left Batum on the28th October.44. The tanker Burano, 4,450 tons, which is at Teneriffe, was reported onthe 4th November to have 5,700 tons of fuel oil on board. Recently she hadreceived orders to get ready for sea.British Minelaying,45. H.M.S. THiot Bank and H.M.S. Plover laid 352 mines in the east coast Barrier on the 2nd November and a further 350 on the 6th November.Minelaying by aircraft has been continued by Bomber Command in the WesternBaltic and off the Atlantic Coast of France. The cumulative effect of a series of reports indicates that the mining of the Kiel Canal has been, on the whole,successful, and the sinking of ships in the Canal has considerably complicatednavigation, with consequent delays to traffic.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.46. During the night of the 29th/30th October there were indications thatenemy surface craft had approached the south end of the Downs for the purposeof minelaying. M.T.Bs. were ordered to intercept, but failed to make contact.The next day 9 mines were swept. These were found in much the same area asthe minefield which had been laid during the night of the 3rd/4th October.Since the 30th October 10 more mines have been swept. The minesweepingtrawlers in this area are continually being attacked by enemy aircraft, and are,moreover, frequently under heavy fire from the French coast.47. No mines have been swept during the week in the minefield off Falmouth,though an Oropesa trawler was mined and sunk about 3 miles south of st. Anthony Head. The channel between Falmouth and Fowey has not yet been declared freeowing to further minelaying by enemy aircraft being suspected, andon the 4th INovember A/S Motor Boat No. 4 was mined and sunk off Fowey,probably by an acoustic mine. A/S Motor Boat 46 then went out and exploded2 mines in the vicinity without damage to herself.48. Seven mines have been swept in the Harwich area this week andsweeping continues.   Fighter Command reported that enemy aircraft appeared
to be shadowing the paddle minesweepers in the Sunk general area, probablywith a view to further minelaying. E-boats were suspected of minelaying in thevicinity on the 1st November, and mines are also thought to have been laid duringthe night of the 4th/5th November. Two mines have been swept in thePortsmouth area.49. It is thought that on 5 out of 7 nights during this week both magneticand acoustic mines have probably been laid round our shores.50. Fourteen acoustic mines have been accounted for this week, most ofthem with little or no damage to the vessels concerned. Four of them were inthe Western Approaches and the rest off the East Coast, 3 of them being in the thames Estuary.51. The total number of mines dealt with to date are : 754 magnetic.686 contact and 48 acoustic.Economic Warfare.British Contraband Control.52. During the month of October 1,497 tons of cargo destined for Germany-have been seized in prize, the chief items being 414 tons of food products, 500 tonsof base metals, 342 tons of petroleum and allied products and 115 tons of rubber..53. The cargoes of metals and rubber were from Roumanian ships and the petroleum from American ships.54. The total seizures from the beginning of the war to the end of Octoberamount to 747,512 tons.&apos; MILITARY SITUATION.Greece.55. It is not yet possible to sum up the results of, or to draw definite conclusions from, the operations on the Graeco-Albanian frontier. No decisivemilitary action has yet been fought, although there have been local encounterswhich, according to Greek military sources, have generally been in their faArour.In the northern sector Greek forces have penetrated a few miles into Albanianterritory in the region of Bilisht, while in the Pindus sector an Italian Alpinicolumn, which has penetrated to within 15 to 20 miles of Metsovo, is reportedto be cut off and in a precarious position. In the southern (Epirus) sector italian forces have advanced almost unopposed towards the Kalamas river, in the vicinity of Philiates, where Greek forces are holding the left bank. It is for this sectorthat the Greek General Staff have most anxiety, and it is here that they expect the main Italian offensive to be launched. Italian tanks have been operating in this area, some of which are reported to have been destroyed. Latest reports indicate that the Italians, supported by dive-bombing and machine-gunning fromthe air, have captured Egoumenista and established a bridge-head over the RiverKalamas at Parapotamos.Weather conditions, particularly in the Epirus sector, are severe, with snowin the mountains.Mobilisation of the Greek Army is now complete, and the morale of thetroops is reported to be high.British Reinforcements.56. 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment disembarked in Creteat Suda Bay on the 1st November, 1940.Bulgaria.57. There has lately been an abundance of assurances that Bulgaria doesnot intend to intervene in the Italo-Greek war and that she harbours noaggressive feelings towards Turkey.The present dispositions of her army, however, suggest that neutrality maynot, in fact, be uppermost in her mind, though it suits her (and more particularlyGermany&apos;s) book to say so for the present. Thus, apart from a few garrisontroops in the North, all her forces are now concentrated in the South andSouth-East; seven or eight infantry divisions against Turkey and five or six[21894] &apos; c
divisions against Greece. When these moves are complete, the Bulgarian railway system will be largely at the disposal of Germany, for use as she sees fit:Yugoslavia.58. 11, has been reliably reported that the General Staff wished to ordergeneral mobilisation at the time of the Italian invasion of Greece, but that theywere not permitted to do so. Certain important preparations have neverthelessbeen made. All formations on the Albanian and Bulgarian frontiers have beenmobilised, all leave has been stopped, and certain formations in the area of theAlbanian frontier have moved to advanced positions. There should now be six divisions in this area, and in the very near future the same number should beavailable on the Bulgarian frontier.Yugoslav authorities have asserted the country&apos;s intention to stand firm in face of any demand for the passage of Italian troops, and it has been hinted thatshe might attack Bulgaria if the latter country attacked Greece. The disposition of her troops would certainly permit this, though the carrying out of such aproposal is likely to depend, first on the attitude of Germany, secondly on thesuccess of Greece in resisting the Italian attack, and thirdly on the amount of help Great Britain is able to j rovide.Finland.59. In their final forms the German demands for military facilities in finland were for transit of troops, for placing of small permanent staffs at ports,for picketing of the Arctic Highway and for the occupation by two battalions and A.A. guns of the Petsamo area.The nickel mines at Salmi jarvi and the road junction to Kirkenes are alsoto have German guards.  Hutments are being built for the necessary garrisons.Although obliged to accept these demands by force majeure, the Finnswelcome the presence of German troops as a guarantee against Russian aggression.Nevertheless the Germans are impressing on the Finns that no offence must begiven to Russia, as Germany cannot tackle Russia until she has disposed of britain.Sweden.60. It is reported that German troops are passing through Sweden via the ports of Tralleborg and Halsingborg, and that extra ferries and shipping have been allotted exclusively to this additional traffic. The Swedish GeneralStaff always pro-German is said to have overcome the reluctance of the swedish government to concede these German demands.Iceland.61. The relief of the Canadian Brigade (of two battalions) by the 70thInfantry Brigade (of three battalions) has been completed. By the same convoyalso arrived the balance of the Field Regiment, R.A., and certain ancillarytroops.Middle East.62. No major development has occurred in Africa this week. There areclear indications, however, that a further Italian advance may shortly be expected in Egypt. Forward supply dumps have been established and quantities of M.T.have been brought up sufficient to carry two native and one white division. Theprevious advance was led by Libyan troops and Blackshirts screened by tanks andmobile artillery, and these forces are now in position for a further move forward.Various frontier encounters have occurred this week in the Sudan, where theItalian concentration in the Kassala area is still maintained. There is no reduction in the garrison facing Kenya.Far East.Malaya.63.   One Indian Brigade Group has arrived in Malaya.
China.64. In South China the Japanese have officially announced their withdrawal from Nanning. The exact destination of the troops being withdrawn is not known, but the Japanese are concentrating forces at Hainan Island.West Africa.Gabon.65. The Northern section of General de Gaulle&apos;s Free French forces operating in the Gabon area has forced the collapse of resistance at Mitzic, andhas advanced as far as Lalara. Further progress will be slow owing to the difficult nature of the country. The runway at Libreville aerodrome was successfully bombed by aeroplanes of the Free French Forces on the 1st November.The submarine in Port Gentil and a Vichy Sloop in Libreville have also been bombed.Gambia.66. The 4th Battalion Gold Coast Regiment, Royal West African frontier force, landed at Bathurst on the 31st October.AIR SITUATION.General Review.67. Projected operations against the enemy were cancelled on one nightowing to unsuitable weather, and were restricted on three other nights and duringeach day of the week by the same cause. When more suitable weather prevailed,however, large scale bombing, which met with pronounced success, was under-taken against important targets in Germany. Effective night attacks against objectives in Italy were carried out on three occasions.Enemy attacks against this country were on a smaller scale than in theprevious week, especially by day, when only about half as many aircraft wareemployed.  There was, however, an increase in the number of attacks on shipping.Royal Air Force operations in the Middle East were again intense, and were directed principally against enemy communications.Operational Aircraft Battle Casualties and Raid Assessment Reports are recorded in Appendices V and VI.Enemy Territory in Europe.68. A total of 279 night and 47 day sorties were flown by Bomber Commandduring the week, and 30 aircraft were despatched by Coastal Command onbombing missions.69. Naples was first attacked by the Royal Air Force on the night of the31st October-lst November, when five Wellingtons bombed an oil refinery and a railway station and junction, fires being started. The same objectives were againattacked on the 3rd-4th November, a line of bombs bursting betweenthe refinery and the junction. On - the 5th-6th operations againstAosta and Milan were not successful owing to severe storms, and only one aircraftreached the primary target at Turin, but naval dockyards and railway com-munications at Brindisi were attacked by six heavy bombers and fires were started.70. An extremely successful raid against communications and public utility undertakings in Berlin took place on the 1st/2nd November during which overthirty tons of bombs were released. Targets includedxthe Schlesischer andTiergarten railway stations, the Tempelhof, Putlitgtrasse and Lehrtermarshalling yards and the Klingenberg and Charlottenburg Power Stations.Fires resulted in every case, some of which were very fierce, one being estimated to cover half a mile square. On the same night two synthetic oil plants atGelsenkirchen were heavily bombed by four Wellingtons, and it is considered that much damage was caused to these targets. A similar objective at Magdeburg,attacked by thirteen Whitleys, was left with many rapidly-spreading fires,including one about half a mile long. Oil plants at Leuna and Homburg were bombed on the 6th/7th, but with less notable results.
71. Attacks on shipbuilding yards in Germany took place on the nights of the 2nd/3rd, when two large fires were started in the target area at Kiel,and on the 5th/ 6th, when sixteen tons of bombs were dropped on docks atBremerhaven, Bremen and Emden, causing severe fires and explosions.72. On the 1st/2nd November gun positions near Calais were attacked byeleven Coastal Command Blenheims, but results were unobserved. A successful attack was made on Hamburg on the 5th/6fch by six heavy bombers, and manyfires, followed by explosions, were caused at the Neuhof Power Station, four rowsof buildings being set alight.73. On the 4th/5th, during operations against Channel ports, our aircraftcaused fires at Havre, but results at Boulogne and Ostend could not be clearlyseen. On the following night twenty-one heavy bombers attacked Boulogne,Flushing, Antwerp, Calais and Dunkirk, and in all cases bursts were seen welldistributed over the docks and harbour basins.74. Attacks by single aircraft on enemy aerodromes were maintained on six days, but though in many instances bombs were seen to burst across the targetsresults were generally difficult to observe.Great Britain.75. Enemy attacks on this country by day were on a scale about half thatof the previous week : 1,115 aircraft as compared with 2,210. The heavier attacks were made on the 1st, 2nd and 5th November, when 350, 210 and 250 aircraft were employed respectively. A high proportion of these were again fighters, someof which carried bombs. Most of the attacks were again over south-east England,the Thames Estuary, and East Anglia, only a few penetrating into the london area. Isolated raids were also made over southern England, the Midlands and east Scotland.76. Attacks on shipping were made on most days, a feature being the firstappearance since the. 18th August of Ju. 87 short-range dive-bombers, which attacked shipping in the Thames Estuary and in the Straits of Dover on the1st November. Dusk attacks were again delivered against Royal Air Forcestations in East Anglia, the Home Counties and north-east England. Therewere also several machine-gun attacks on civilians during the week.77. Enemy attacks by night were again directed mainly against Londonand the Midlands, but there was an increase in activity over Scotland, occasioned by the recent move to Stavanger from France of about thirty long-range bombers.The scale of attack was not quite so heavy as in the previous week, the tojtalnumber of bombers operating being 1,015 compared with 1,325. On the nights of the 4th/5th, 5th/6th and 6th/7th November over 200 aircraft operated over this country.78. During the week Fighter Command flew 113 night sorties, and by day761 patrols, involving 4.063 aircraft. Details of casualties are given inAppendixCoastal.79. Each day Coastal Command continued to carry out anti-invasion and anti-submarine patrols and offensive and photographic reconnaissances. A totalof 197 patrols and reconnaissances involving 340 sorties was flown and 103 convoy escorts were provided. Minelaying in enemy waters was carried out on two nightsby a total of eleven aircraft from Bomber Command.80. On the 31st October two Hudsons of Coastal Command bombed a 3,000ton merchant vessel off Lister and registered a direct hit amidships. One ofthese aircraft was damaged in combat with a Messerschmitt 109 and a thirdHudson engaged on the same offensive reconnaissance is missing. On the6th November two Beauforts carried out a torpedo attack on a convoy oft&apos;Terschelling and scored one hit on a large heavily-laden merchant vessel. On the4th November a Sunderland flying-boat co-operated with naval units in rescuingsurvivors of the Laurentic, the sinking of which is reported under the naval situation.
81. Minelaying operations off our coasts were continued at night by theenemy, the total aircraft engaged on these operations during the week being 65.German aircraft have recently made two ^photographic reconnaissances overIceland. A circuit was made of Kaldadames aerodrome at 6,000 feet and itswhereabouts must therefore be known to the enemy.Greece.,82. Reports of Italian air operations in this region have been vague and do not allow of a proper appreciation either of the intensity of the Italian AirForce efforts or of the results so far obtained. Bombing attacks have beenwidespread and among the places attacked were Patras, Salonika, Tatoi, Larissa,Salamis, Piraeus, Crete and Corfu. These attacks have resulted only in civilian casualties and in relatively slight material damage.83. It has been confirmed that four Italian bombers have been destroyed and a fifth badly damaged by Greek air defences. The Greeks claim to havebombed the Italian air bases at Koritza and Argyrocastro in Albania, and havealso co-operated with their land forces.Middle East and Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.84. During the week our aircraft made several successful attacks on enemymotor vehicles, including a column of five hundred at Menastir on the 31st October.Attacks were also made on enemy aircraft on the ground at Menastir and atGambut on the 31st October, when two and probably three were destroyed and several damaged. On the 5th November five Blenheims successfully bombed the fort at Garn Ul Grein, exploding an ammunition store. Later in the day nineBlenheims attacked the camp at Maddsllna, bombs bursting on machine-gunposts and on trenches. The harbours at Tobruk and Bardia were each attackedtwice.85. On the 31st October twenty-two enemy bombers escorted by twelvefighters attacked Matruh, Gerawla and Quasaba. They were intercepted bytwenty-two of our fighters and jettisoned their bombs. Four enemy bombers and four fighters were destroyed and four bombers were damaged. Five of our fighters were lost, two by collision and three by enemy action, but three of our pilotswere saved.Malta.86. Two enemy attacks were made on the Island during the week. On the2nd November Italian bombers escorted by fighters bombed Luqa aerodrome,where an empty hangar was hit and a runway damaged. Our fighters interceptedand destroyed two enemy aircraft, probably destroyed a third, and damaged two others. On the 5th an enemy aircraft dropped bombs in the Grand Harbourbut there was no damage or casualties. A Hurricane engaged the raider andprobably damaged it.87. Our aircraft made several reconnaissances during the week, including one of the Gulf and harbour of Taranto, in which several units of the italian fleet were located.Sudan, A den and East A frica.88. Several attacks were made during the week on enemy communications and motor vehicles. On the 31st October three Wellesleys dive-bombed and machine-gunned a convoy of 100 motor vehicles carrying troops and storesnear Gondar, and three hours later aircraft of the South African Air Forcemachine-gunned the same convoy. On the following day two Gauntlets registeredfour direct hits on a convoy near Galabat, and on the 4th three Battles of theSouth African Air Force bombed a concentration of motor vehicles at Neghelli.The railway line near Diredawa and a railway bridge near Jibuti were bombedon the 31st October and the 5th November, and some damage was done.Our aircraft attacked Assab on three occasions during the week. bombs were seen to fall on and near the underground oil tanks and a fire was started at a supply depot.[21894] . d
89. Enemy attacks on objectives in this area have been generally ineffective.The island of Perim and Roseires on the Blue Nile were each bombed twice andWajir once, but no damage was done.Air Intelligence.Italy.90. Several aerodromes have been handed over to the Corpo Aereo Italiano,which is operating in Belgium under the command of General Fougier, and,according to the Italian press, considerable difficulty is being experienced in operations owing to the wintry weather conditions and to faulty recognition of aircraft by German anti-aircraft crews.Roumania.91. Nearly the whole of the Roumanian Air Force is now concentrated atPipera and Brasov, and a number of good aerodromes, formerly in use, have beenvacated. The obvious inference is that it is intended to make more aerodromesavailable for the Germans, and the presence of German aircraft at some of thesehas already been reported.Bulgaria.92. There are various rumours that permission has been given to Germanyto establish A.A. defences in Bulgaria, but these are not confirmed. There are other unconfirmed reports that the aerodromes at Plovdiv. Graf Ignatio, ColioGanchevo and Yambol may be put at the disposal of the German Air Force.Iran.93. The Shah has been greatly incensed at German press and Italianbroadcast allusions to the possibility of air attacks on Abadan, following therecent Italian raid on Bahrein. He has increased the Abadan defences and hascancelled an order for sixty Italian bombers.French Equatorial Africa.94. An unspecified number of American aircraft, probably Glenn-Martinbombers, are stated to have been despatched from Senegal to Gabon to reinforcepro-Vichy military units in the territory.China.95. Following upon the adoption of the firmer policy towards Japan implied by the reopening of the Burma Road, Chiang Kai-Shek has expressed a keendesire for closer and active co-operation between Britain and China. It isprobable that what is mostly desired by China is the sending of a British Air,Military and Economic Mission and, as soon as possible, supplies of aircraft, ofwhich China is in urgent need, particularly fighters.96. Further information has been received regarding the effects of theJapanese bombing campaign which started with the reopening of the burma road. On the 31st October, 37 Japanese bombers attacked the Salween Bridge,causing damage which it was estimated could be repaired in three or four days.The Mekong River bridge has also been attacked several times, but with so faronly slight damage, and the bridge has not been put out of action. These andother reports appear to confirm previous estimates that Japanese operations would only succeed in hindering traffic, which is reported to be continuing moreor less uninterruptedly.97. In the bombing, on the 26th October, of the Loi Wing aircraft factory,approximately 70 miles to the North of Lashio, the 36 Japanese bombers involvedviolated British territory on at least two occasions, and one bomb was releasedon a Burmese tea plantation, fortunately without causing casualties. the damage to the Factory is reported to be less than was at first thought, and canbe made good in a short time in the absence of further raids or labour panic.The damage included two aircraft destroyed on the landing ground and five inthe main assembly shed, where Chiang. Kai-Shek&apos;s private amphibian was alsodamaged.
HOME SECURITY.General Review.98. The force and extent of enemy air activity is summarised under air situation.Damage.Military Establishments.99. Damage was done to the Royal College for the Blind at Norwoodoccupied by the AM.P.C. (Munition Production) and to the Small Arms school at Hythe, and two military camps at Farnborough were machine-gunned.A aircraft Factories.100. Damage to the aircraft industry was slight during this period. Sixfactories were hit but little damage was caused. The temporary failure of the gas supply at Coventry has affected production to a minor extent.Public Utilities.101.   Utility Services have escaped almost unscathed.Telecommunications.102. There has been no serious damage to exchange buildings and damage tocables has been on a much smaller scale.At Chadweil Heath on the night 2nd-3rd November eight trunk cableswere put out of action.Restoration of services to subscribers on three of the London exchanges is proceeding well and regular progress on such repairs is now expected.Railways.103.   Hits in London declined from 56 to 33 and elsewhere from 42 to 18.In London the Victoria-Brixton line was blocked on the 5th November.Elsewhere, the L.N.E.R. main line was blocked by 2 U.X.Bs. north ofHatfield; extensive damage was done to lines at Vauxhall Station, Birmingham,the main Glasgow-Edinburgh line was blocked by an U.X.B. at Easter HouseStation, and two locomotives were damaged in Kittybrewster siding, Aberdeen.Industry.104. The number of hits on general industrial installations fell consider-ably. In the previous two weeks hits have been 101 and 57 respectively, but inthe period under review only 31. The damage caused by 11 of these 31 hits was negligible, and in a further 14 cases slight. Severe damage occurred at only oneinstallation :  British Sugar Corporations Sugar-Beet Factory, Ely.Production will be suspended for a month.Substantial damage was caused at the following : Tate and Lyle, Ltd., Thames Refinery, Silvertown.Damage to water mains, production suspended for three days.Telephone Construction and Maintenance Co., Ltd., Greenwich.Damage to steam plant, submarine cable section idle for a week.Tilbury Docks, Essex.Fairly extensive damage to quay.General Electric Co., Ltd., Copeswood, Coventry.Condenser shop idle for a week.Royal Ordnance Factory, Glascoed, Mon.Two sections were idle for four days awaiting disposal of U.X.Bs.
Other Damage.105. Bombs have been dropped on three nights in the grounds ofBuckingham Palace, causing damage to the Royal Mews. Lion House, Holborn(occupied by the Ministry of Labour), Apsley House and the Naval and MilitaryClub in Piccadilly and the Edinburgh Zoo all suffered damage.106. Damage to house property in London has been less than in previousweeks but is still more extensive than in the provinces. The South-East towns(especially Ramsgate), Birmingham, Coventry and East Scotland (particularlyAberdeen) have received most damage, but a serious degree of damage has alsobeen reported from Hull, Maidstone, Ashford, Luton, Boston and from a numberof Home County areas, particularly Essex.107. Police stations have been hit at Kilburn, where 25 casualties were caused, and Dover; fire stations at Poplar and Bromley; A.R.P. service premisesat Bexley, Dover and Finsbury. Though several civilian shelters have been damaged, casualties have in no case been heavy.108. Machine-gunning of villages, small towns and railway stations hasbeen a prominent feature. Fifteen instances were reported on the 3rd November,eight on the 31st October and five on the 4th November, besides scattered incidentson other days.109. There were no serious incidents reported from Hospitals or Schoolsalthough they sustained a considerable share of the enemy&apos;s attacks.Civilian Casualties.110. The approximate figures for the week ending 0600 the 6th Novemberwere 399 killed and 1,102 in j Tired of which London suffered 253 killed and 497injured. This represents about half the total number of casualties for theprevious week in London; in the provinces, however, while the number of deathsis about half that of last week, the total of wounded has increased from about400 to 600. In no town outside London did casualties exceed 100, the highestprovincial death roll being at Fraserburgh where over 28 were killed.U.X.B.&apos;s.111. For the first time since intensive bombing was started the total numberof U.X.B.&apos;s remaining for disposal has sunk below 3,000. Of 2,740 remaining488 are in London.Morale and Civil Defence Operations.112. The courage of people in the country as a whole remains at a high level.To this the Civil Defence Services have contributed by their efficiency and sympathy.113. Civil Defence work has not been so arduous as in previous weeks butadverse weather conditions have made the fall of bombs more difficult forwardens to locate and have hampered rescue and repair work.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Berlin. Bergmann&apos;s Cable Factory stores at Wilhelmsruh, the Mauserfactories at Wittenau and the goods yard at Pankow have been damaged. Onebomb has fallen on the prison at Tegel. It is now learnt that the A.E.G. turbineworks previously reported damaged received four hits and work was stopped for four days.   The damage is however stated to be not extensive.In one week (period not mentioned) 200 persons were killed and 500 injured.Hamburg. Photographs on the 28th October disclose that at theRhenania Ossag refmei*y an oil fire is burning and that part of its buildings andalso of other buildings in the immediate vicinity have been damaged.Early in August out of a total of 26 submarines building in yards in theneighbourhood 5 were damaged beyond repair as a result of air attack.Stettin. It appears from photographs taken on the 29th October that four large buildings of the Union Chemical Factories on the island at thejunction of the Oder and Molle Fahrt rivers are damaged.Essen. Certain departments of Krupps have been closed down, and their products are now being manufactured at works in Breslau and Oppeln.Reisholz. About two months ago the Feldmuhle Paper Mills were considerably damaged and the water mains in the immediate vicinity destroyed.The damage has been repaired and production is now normal.Railivays. -The Berlin-Paris route via Frankfurt is not open. Trains arerouted through Brussels, but have to take a roundabout route north of Cologne,Aachen and Liege.A traveller from Berlin to Hamburg in the third week of September was compelled to make five changes on the outward journey and eight on thereturn journey.   The time taken was about twenty-four hours on each occasion.General.
