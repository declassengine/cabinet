/ 112THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECRET.W.P. (30) 439.November 11, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.A NAVAL AIR FORCE.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.I STRONGLY recommend that the Cabinet give a direction to the admiralty to develop their own air force.Warfare has changed in character and an Admiralty without an adequateair force is not fully equipped to carry on naval war in modern conditions.The Navy&apos;s strength is taxed to the uttermost to-day. The calls made upon those ships which are suited to deal with the present menace are almostbeyond their powers, particularly with the Mediterranean obligations.The raider is the most serious incident and it is one sure to be repeated. Wemust expect that the enemy will develop this type of attack against our convoys.On account of the need for calls on ships suited to meet this menace, airassistance is now necessary in order to guard the Western Approaches. In fact,the pursuit of the submarine attacking by night depends on this assistance.Unless we prepare an adequate air force for the fleet we shall be compelledto acknowledge that our blockade of the enemy is, to some extent, countered bythe enemy&apos;s blockade of Britain.It is not a satisfactory answer to say that the Royal Air Force can fulfil thetask of supplementing the surface craft of the fleet.  It has failed to do so.The Coastal Command of the R.A.F. is quite inadequate.There is no increasing flow of pilots on a large scale.Further, the training of pilots for naval work must necessarily take adifferent form from the type of training which the Royal Air Force develops.A Naval Air Pilot must be taught to distinguish a battleship from a destroyer. The whole tendency of his training is necessarily governed by thespecial conditions in which he will operate, over the sea, and not over the land,in co-operation with ships and in attacks upon ships.Such a result can be achieved only under the direction of a naval aircommand, including the present Coastal Command of the Royal Air Force andthe Fleet Air Arm.Behind those two services, a degree of vigour and resolution must be developed which will ensure, the creation of an additional force in the shortest possible space of time.Weeks only can be devoted to the strengthening of the naval air force. Timemeasured in months would be too long.B.Ministry of Aircraft production,November 11, 1940.Copy No.    21[21904]
