JE C R E T*/P. (40)4.54.WAR CABINEToSTRENGTHENING OP COASTAL COMMAND,Memor^apodiim. by. the.J?irst Lord of. tthe Admiralty.1. The Admiralty are concerned to improve and strengthen the air forces available for coastal and sea reconnaissancein the conditions we now face, viz?(a) Our reconnaissance over the North Sea is inadequate compared with the Germans. Ifthe Navy is to work effectively it must beas well served in this direction as are theGermans 0(b) The enormous increase in the mining from theair of our ports and swept channels points to the need for increased air patrols.(c) The wider range of the German aircraft westwardsince the acquisition of French South Westernbases has led to a scale of attack on our trade which is of a most serious character both from air attack on individual ships and from U-boataction against convoys through air and submarineeo-o rdinati on a(d) The need for continuous air cover to our new system of convoy organisation and routeing and additional reconnaissance in the convoy areas.(e) Increased reconnaissance from our foreign stations.It is observed that whilst the Coastal Command has given the Navy every possible assistance with the forces attheir command, no means of meeting the Navy&apos;s urgent require-ments can be within reach on the present&apos; Coastal Commandstrengths     That Commandos strength has increased from 150.to 300 planes since September, 1939u      In my view the numbershould be brought much nearer to 1,000 planes in operation at the earliest possible memento20 There are therefore both short-term and long-termrequirementso

Short Term Requirement.5.        The requirement is to increase rapidly the numberof aircraft operating under Coastal Command as quickly aspossible and it is proposed that this should be done asfollows:-(i) New aircraft of Coastal Command types should be put in commission with all speed andwith only the minimum number in reserve.This means that at the same time existingtypes kept in commission. .   This applies to the following types -Flying boats.P.B.Y1s when commissioned should not beused to re-equip Stranraers, Londons . .and Lerwicks but to form fresh squadrons.G-.R1 s and Bombers.Hudsons and Beauforts Whitley not tore-equip Ansons.Fighters.Beaufighter not to re-equip Blenheims.(ii) A certain additional allocation of hon-coastal command types to Coastal Command, i.e,4 Whitley squadrons (to make up for this 2of the 3 Hampden squadrons now employedon minelaying to be diverted to bombing.3 Beaufighter squadrons.(iii) Re-introduction of security patrols over the bases from which German minelaying aircraftoperate.(iv) In practice this would mean that of the 100new squadrons to be put into service by june, 1941, 15 of them should go into the coastal Command.Long-Term Requirement.4. The minimum requirements for the near future are considered to be as shown in Tables A and B annexed tothis paper.To produce these requirements, two things arerequired -(l) An increased production programme.(2) Increased personnel.As regards (2) it would of course be best if this increased?ersonnel were recruited and trained by the R.A.F. but ifhere is any difficulty in doing this the Navy are preparedto assist&apos;in any way possible.(Intld) A.V.A.Admiralty, S.W.I.,4TH NOVEMBER,  1940, -S-  &apos;
