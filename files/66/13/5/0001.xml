ICabinet War Room\
General Review.1. Shipping losses through attack by enemy submarines have been very severe.Two Italian U-Boats have been sunk in the Mediterranean, and one Italiandestroyer was sunk in the Red Sea.Home Waters.2. Air reconnaissance having reported four enemy destroyers off Breststeering west on the morning of the 17th, a force of two cruisers and fivedestroyers, which bad been sent to intercept, engaged the enemy at extreme rangewith inconclusive results. In the evening, three Blenheims attacked the enemywithout result, and our own force was also unsuccessfully attacked by enemy aircraft.Three M.T.B.&apos;s carried out a sweep off the Dutch Coast during the night ofthe 17th/18th October, but sighted nothing. One of our M.T.B.&apos;s fouledwreckage during this operation and returned damaged.During the afternoon of the 18th, acting on special intelligence material andan accurate R.D.F. bearing, two of our M.T.B.&apos;s attacked with torpedoes three enemy minesweepers 14 miles south of Dover and claimed one hit.3. H.M. Destroyers Fame and A shanti went aground when leaving the Tyneto carry out escort duties and, up to the present, attempts to refloat them have been unsuccessful. The crews and valuable stores and ammunition have been removed and, provided the weather holds,&apos; it is hoped to attempt salvage operations at thenext spring tides on the 1st November.4. Mines have accounted for the following casualties : H.M.S. Dundalksunk off Harwich on the 17th, H.M. Trawler Kingston Cairngorm off Portlandon the 18th, and H.M. Destroyer Venetia in the Thames Approaches on the 19th.96 survivors were rescued from the latter ship, but five officers, including the captain, are missing. H.M. Trawler Velia was also sunk in the same locality.The Minesweeping Trawlers Wave flower and Joseph Button were sunk offAldeburgh, apparently by mines, on the 21st and 22nd respectively, and H.M.Trawler Hickory off Portland on the 22nd.5. On the 21st M.T.B. 17, while on patrol off Ostend, was sunkcarrying out an attack on an enemy trawler, and H.M. Canadian DestroyerMargaree was sunk in collision with a merchant ship 450 miles west of Slyne Headwhile on passage to Halifax.  34 survivors have been rescued from the Margaree.The Dover area was shelled on three occasions during the week, but onlyminor damage was caused. On the 18th October 4 bombs were dropped on the&apos; Collingwood &apos;&apos; establishment at Portsmouth. Twelve ratings and 6 Wrenswere wounded, and gas, electric and water mains were put out of action.During air attacks on Coventry on the nights of the 20th and 21st the R.N.Store Depot and Admiralty gun-mounting store were severely damaged.Northern Waters.6. On the morning of the 16th Skuas and Swordfish from H.M.S. Furiouscarried out a successful attack on Tromso. Bombs were dropped on the oil tanks and seaplane base, and several fires were started. One Skua forced landed inLapland and the crew have been interned.In the morning of the 23rd H.M. Ships Naiad and Bonaventure left Rosythto raid enemy shipping in the vicinity of Egersund. Three destroyers which hadbeen engaged in a search for U-Boats returning East of Shetlands alsoproceeded to carry out an offensive sweep off Stadtlandet. As there were indications of activities off the Norwegian coast possibly by a heavy German unitthree cruisers left Rosyth in support of these destroyers, while H.M. Ships Hoodand Repulse with 2 cruisers and 5 destroyers sailed to support the cruisers.During these operations only one ship of 400 tons was sighted. She was sunk by destroyers of the 5th Flotilla.
Mediterranean.7. On return from patrol, H.M. Submarine Regent reported that she hadunsuccessfully attacked the Italian battlefleet off Taranto on the 30th September.On the 9th October she sank a 5,000-ton merchant ship in convoy off Durazzo,after which she was severely hunted and sustained some damage.West Africa.8. Four French submarines and a tanker escorted by a sloop and aircraftpassed Gibraltar in a westerly direction at noon on the 17th. They wereshadowed by our aircraft to ensure that their destination was Casablanca.On the 18th October H.M.S. Cornwall to the southward of Freetownintercepted the French troop ship Indochinois which unsuccessfully attempted toscuttle herself on being ordered to return to Dakar. Subsequently a boardingparty from Cornwall was sent on board, and the Indochinois, escorted byCornwall, returned to Freetown.Red Sea.9. During the night of the 20th/21st October in the southern Red Sea atroop convoy from Bombay en route for Suez escorted by a strong naval escortwas unsuccessfully attacked by two Italian destroyers, one of which, theFrancesca Nullo, was sunk by ELM. Destroyer Kimberley. The latter came underfire from an enemy shore battery of 3 guns, 2 of which she claimed to have silencedbefore herself sustaining damage in the engine room from one 4-inch shell, which necessitated her withdrawal and subsequent return to Port Sudan in tow ofH.M. Destroyer Kingston.Convoys have been bombed by the enemy in the southern part of the Rea Seawithout success. On the 21st an enemy destroyer was bombed off Harmil island and a hit was obtained on the stern.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. In Home Waters three attacks, two of which were by aircraft, were carried out without visible result. In the Mediterranean a U-Boat was located bya flying boat on the 18th 60 miles east of Gibraltar. After being attacked byH.M.S. Firedrake the U-Boat, which proved to be the Italian Durbo, surfaced,and subsequently sank after being abandoned by her crew. Five officers and43 men were rescued. On the 20th October the Italian U-Boat Lafole wasrammed and sunk 120 miles east of Gibraltar by H.M.S. Hotspur after havingbeen brought to the surface by depth charge from H.M.S. Gallant. Elevensurvivors were rescued.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. During the period under review 36 ships (150,091 tons) have beenreported sunk. Of these, 17 British (89,199 tons), 3 Norwegian (14,080 tons),3 Swedish (13,533 tons), 3 Dutch (10,878 tons), 2 Greek (7,408 tons), 1 Estonian(1,186 tons), 1 Belgian (5,186 tons) and 1 Yugo-Slav (5,135 tons) were sunk by submarine. Three British vessels (1,722 tons) were sunk by mine, 1 British(1,595 tons) was sunk by E-Boat and a British trawler (169 tons) was sunk by aircraft.In addition, news has been received that 3 British ships (21,059 tons)previously reported as damaged are now known to have been sunk and two additional British ships (10,458 tons) are now known to have been torpedoed and sunk on the 7th September.Damage by aircraft, mine or submarine to 21 British ships (79,791 tons) hasbeen reported and 2 additional British ships (10,232 tons) are now known to havebeen damaged in the. period previous to this report.Details are given in Appendix I.[21849] b
788During the week 20 ships have been lost in convoy.The Mediterranean and Indian Ocean convoys included this week are not thefirst convoys run over these routes. Figures of such earlier convoys a..re notavailable.  Troop ships and transports sailing in these convoys are excluded.Since the commencement of hostilities the number of ships convoyed hasbeen :  British...............      32,887Allied .........      ......        4,035Neutral        ...............        4,04940,971Total losses since commencement of hostilities are British 123, Allied 17,Neutral 12, total 152, giving a ratio of losses to numbers convoyed of British 1 in267, Allied 1 in 237, Neutral 1 in 337, total 1 in 270.13. Imports by ships in convoy during the week ending the 19th Octobertotalled 847,477 tons, compared with 1,006,283 tons for the week ending the12th October, and an average of 934,547 tons for the previous ten weeks.Mineral imports were 230,579 tons, of which 150,944 tons were steel, scrap iron,pig-iron and iron-ore, compared with 338,955 tons of minerals and 260,301 tons ofsteel, &amp;c, for the previous week. Eight tankers brought 80,258 tons of oil ofvarious grades. Timber and wood pulp imports were 124,424 tons and cereals135,846 tons, 14 ships being fully laden with grain.Enemy Intelligence.German Main Units,14. Photographic reconnaissance on the 21st October showed Gneisenau andScharnhorst still in floating dock; Lutzow and a 6-in. cruiser, possibly theNumberg, in dry dock at Kiel. The Koln was not seen, but the position in which she was believed to be was obscured. At Hamburg an 8-in. cruiser was in theBlohm and Voss yard. At Bremen there were an 8-in. cruiser and four destroyers, and the battleship Tirpitz and one destroyer at Wilhelmshaven.The other units of the German fleet at present unlocated are believed to bein the Baltic, except that there have been indications that a heavy cruiser maybe in Norwegian waters.Other Surface Craft.15. The main disposition of shipping in enemy-occupied ports in Franceand the Low Countries remains the same. There are still seven destroyers, fiveescort vessels and some minor naval craft at Brest. Concentrations of merchant ships and barges are still at Rotterdam and Antwerp and of merchant ships atHavre. Large numbers of barges remain at Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne, butthe numbers have been reduced at Ostend and Flushing.U-Boats.16.   The disposition of German submarines to the westward and northwardh-West Approaches remains much as before, though with increasednumbers.   It is clear that an effort is being made to maintain a force of ten to twelve submarines at sea, of which as many as five may be disposed in or off theProtection of Seaborne Trade.12. In the week ended noon Wednesday, the 23rd October, 1940, the numberof vessels convoyed was :  British    ....      ............      ...      636Allied     ......      ............      IllNeutral..................        41
North-Western Approaches at any one time. Though there is not yet material for an analysis of the tactics employed, it is almost certain that the attacks onConvoys HX. 79 and SC. 7 on the 18th, 19th and 20th October were carried outby at least two submarines on each occasion. In the latter part of the period under review there has been evidence of some three or four returning to Lorientand a similar number proceeding northwards off the South-West and West ofIreland. In addition to the primary effort of the enemy off the North-western approaches, there have been a few reports of submarines in the Bay of Biscayand in an area about 250 miles North-West of Finisterre.Italian Main Units.17. There is no further news of Italian main units at Taranto and Brindisisince the 14th October, when no appreciable change was noticed at Taranto, andthe ships at Brindisi consisted of three destroyers, two submarines, two merchant ships and the hulk of a battleship on which work was proceeding. There isconsiderable evidence of activity both at Benghazi and Tobruk.The destruction of the destroyer Francesco Nullo leaves six Italian destroyers in the Red Sea.U-Boats.18. In the earlier part of the period under review an Italian submarine was believed to be about 150 miles west of the Gironde, and one was reported off cape Roca, Portugal, on the 18th October. Another report gave the position ofone off San Miguel, Azores, on the 22nd October. Two which appeared in theWestern Mediterranean were sunk by our destroyers to the eastward of theStraits of Gibraltar.French Intelligence.19. The battle cruiser Strasbourg, which had left Toulonon the 15th October, returned to that port on the 22nd Octoberexercises.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.20. In Home Waters there has been no further news of developments inregard to the sailing of German merchant ships from Vigo.The Spezia, 1,825 tons, was reported on the 18th October to be loading atBarcelona for Italy.In the Black Sea the Ithaka, 1,773 tons, arrived at Galatz on the 21st Octoberfrom Russia with 3,000 tons of manganese ore. On the same day the Delos, 2,589tons, and the Larissa, 1,819 tons, left Galatz in ballast for Russia.In the Pacific one of the ships which sailed from Kobe on the 9th Octoberreturned to her moorings two days later.In the Atlantic the Windhuk, 16,662 tons, speed 18 knots, is said to be making preparations to sail from Santos, Brazil.The tanker Germania, 9,851 tons, has been refused an application for 60 tonsof diesel oil at Ponta Delgada in the Azores though since the refusal she hasbeen showing considerable activity. The Klaus Schoke, 5,848 tons, at Horta, isreported as likely to sail, possibly escorted by a U-Boat; she has recently taken150 tons of coal from the Luise Bornhofen.Italian.21. The only report about Italian merchant ships this week that is of any interest is that the Todaro, 5,162 tons, at Teneriffe was making preparations tosail on the 22nd October.British Minelaying.22. There has been comparatively little minelaying in the past week. Onthe 21st October H.M.S. Teviot Bank and H.M.S. Plover laid 328 mines in theEast Coast Barrier, and minelaying by aircraft has been carried out by coastal command off the Dutch and Flemish Coasts.with other unitsafter completing
Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.23. Falmoutn, which has been closed to shipping since the 1st October, wasreopened on the 21st October by a searched channel to the south of the Lizard.Sweeping has been hampered this week by fog. One mine was cut and oneexploded early in the week. It is now intended to establish a channel to the eastward of Fa]mouth and to reopen Fowey.The contact minefield East of Dover is being swept daily, but cannot yet beconsidered clear. Five mines have been swept during the week making the total for this field 33. Sweeping operations have not been troubled much by explosiveor other cutters, though a large number of explosive cutters have been found along the shore, nearly all dangerous but not apparently, very effective. Experience ofcutters has been somewhat similar in the Falmoutn minefield, very few explodingthough as many as five anti-sweeping devices have been found.24. The contact minefield in the vicinity of the War Channel East ofHarwich has accounted for the loss of five ships during the week, three of thembeing minesweepers. One of them was mined while sweeping back through wateralready swept. After various casualties and a certain number of mines being-swept the channel was moved temporarily to the westward.A trawler was mined and sunk in an old dangerous area north-east of KnockDeep on the 19th October. Paddle Minesweepers have been operating in this general area for over a fortnight and subsequent to the casualty have swept threemore mines.An A/S Trawler was mined, and later sank after striking another mine while in tow five miles off Portland Bill. Three trawlers were sent to determine ifpossible the limits of this minefield and to search for mines. Three mines have since been swept though unfortunately another trawler has been mined and sunk.Early in September a dangerous area was declared south of the Portsmoutheastern approach. A further search of this area was made a few days ago, andone mine swept and one recovered. Between the 8th and 15th October 23 minesfrom this field have been washed ashore.25. Six casualties, including a destroyer and an M.T.B., have occurred inthe Thames Estuary this week. Two of these ships have reached harbour, andanother has been beached, though salvage is considered improbable. Two of the casulties are thought to have been caused by acoustic mines.It has so far been impossible to tell in some cases whether a casualty has been caused by an acoustic or magnetic mine, or possibly a combination. There isno question, however, that there has been an increase of magnetic minelaying.LL sweeps have this week exploded 18 mines of the East Coast and 3 off Plymouth,though these last may have been old ones as they were in water not recently used.The totals of mines dealt with to date are as follows : 718 magnetic, 640 contact, and 31 acoustic.A LL trawler, fitted with anti-acoustic gear, was to carry out trials in theBarrow Deep on the 22nd October, but the report has not yet been received.Mediterranean.26. Five more mines have been swept in the dangerous areas south of Malta,making 10 altogether.Four LL whalers sailed on the 21st October for the Mediterranean via the cape.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.27. Two new divisions (one armoured and one infantry) have been identifiedduring the past few weeks, bringing the total number of identified divisions upto 207. It is possible that demobilisation of certain units is taking place, butit would be unwise to assume that the total strength of the German Army is inany way being reduced.28. There have recently been indications that the German forces in Austria,Slovakia and the Protectorate have been increased mainly by the movement of

It is believed that other divisions are being motorized, but information is at present lacking as to their number, and theyhave therefore not been included in this R4sume\29. Information regarding the number of German troops in Roumania isstill conflicting, but there are probably the equivalent of two divisions, or some30,000-40,000 men there, including instructional cadres for the Roumanian Armyand troops for the defence of the oil districts. It is unlikely that Germany willremain content with this small force, and we may expect to see a gradual increase under one pretext or another.Italy and Italian Possessions.30. In Libya, the most easterly move has been the establishment of a camp16 miles east of Sidi Barrani. The preparation of a sound Lines of Communica-tion system has been continued, the construction of a pipe-line running east fromSollum being an important feature.31. It is thought that internal conditions in Italian East Africa may becausing the authorities some uneasiness. Despite the continued presence ofconcentrations on the frontiers of Sudan and Kenya, there has been no forwardmovement except for the advance of a small column towards Roseires, which maybe for reconnaissance purposes or possibly to put a stop to the infiltration of rebelEthiopians.The Balkan States.Bulgaria.32. There are many rumours of the presence of German troops, but thereis as yet no reason to believe that the German infiltration has gone beyond sendingtechnicians and &quot;tourists.&quot;Greece.33. The Greek General Staff are of the opinion that the chances of an Axisattack before winter are rapidly decreasing, and that weather conditions will soon make it impossible. The immediate move of the Axis will probably bedirected toward undermining morale.[21849] cunits from Central Germany. Apart from this, and the fact that at least oneof the divisions identified in Roumania is believed to have come from SouthernPoland, there has been no appreciable change in the distribution of german divisions, which is believed to be as follows :  
Iceland.36. The Inspector-General of Training arrived in Iceland on the 15thOctober. By the same vessel part of the 143rd Field Regiment, RA., also arrived.All the Walrus aircraft are being withdrawn from Iceland.The Middle East.37. There has been no change in the operational situation in Egypt, Sudanand East Africa.Egypt.38. A battalion with supporting artillery and aircraft co-operation raidedan enemy Camp 14 miles east of Sidi Barrani on the 22nd/23rd October. Theywere heavily engaged by enemy artillery. One Company destroyed 8 M.T. withMolotov bombs. Our casualties were 3 killed and 4 wounded. Enemy casulties are unknown except for one prisoner.39.   A convoy &quot;containing personnel and material arrived at Suez on the21st October, 1940.It included : 52 Lt. A.A. Regt., RA.6 Lt. A.A. Bty., R.A.153 Hy. A.A. Btv., RA.1 R.H.A. Regt.51 Army Fd. Regt.292 Army Fd. Coy., R.E.Drafts.44 25-pdr.25 2-pdr. A.Tk. guns.10 6-inch Hows.1,190 Bren guns.90 Bren Carriers.60 Scout Carriers.Ammunition, mines and explosives.Sudan.40. On the 19th October a patrol of the Sudan Defence Force in 4 trucksand 2 armoured cars surprised approximately 1,000 enemy at Teteb on theKassala-Tesseni Road and attacked them from the rear at 100 yards. Theenemy casualties were very heavy.  Our patrol suffered no casualties.Yugoslavia.34. The rumour campaign has been launched with vigour, and it is probablethat a number of reports of Hungarian concentration on the Yugoslav frontier,and of the presence of German troops in the same area and in Albania have beenspread with the idea of intimidating the country.VTurkey.35. There has undoubtedly been a stiffening of attitude in the last weeks,and there is every hope that Turkey will offer a firm resistance to any german attack on her own territory. Turkey has stated that she will honour her treaty obligations to support Greece if the latter is attacked by Bulgaria, though shewill not help Greece against a purely Italian or German attack, even if it is partly directed through Bulgaria. This proviso gives a good indication of theTurkish attitude in general. This firmer attitude is thus not to be attributed tothe fact that she has become more pro-British, but results from the fear thatTurkish integrity may be threatened. Turkey is fully aware that, if Germanyadvances in the east, the straits will constitute the primary objective. Anotherreason for her firmer attitude is the present, improvement in Turko-Russianrelations.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.43. Bad weather continued to restrict our operations both by day and night and enemy activity was on a reduced scale, probably for the same reason. our air attacks against Northern Italy have been resumed.In the Mediterranean and Middle East, operations by the Royal Air force were vigorously maintained in all areas but no major air activity by the enemy was reported.Operational Aircraft Battle Casualties and Raid Assessment Reports are recorded in Appendices V and VI.Enemy Territory in Europe.44. Despite very adverse weather conditions, which entirely preventedoperations on two nights, 302 night sorties were flown by Bomber Command and68 by Coastal Command (in addition to their normal duties). Sixty-five cloud-flying Blenheims were despatched during daylight hours by Bomber Commandbut adverse weather considerably hampered their operations.45. Our heaviest attack took place on the night of the 20th-21st Octoberwhen 138 medium and heavy bombers were despatched. A considerable weight of bombs were released within the various target areas, but results were difficultto assess except at Berlin, where a military objective and important marshalling yards were hit and at Grevenbroich and Cologne, where aluminium works were set on fire and several large fires were started in the vicinity of the HohenzollernBridge. At Bonn and Munster many explosions were caused when goods yardswere bombed.This night also marked the resumption of our attacks on Northern Italyafter an interval of some six weeks. Targets in Turin, Milan, Aosta, Bergamoand Savona were attacked; at Aosta a large sheet of flame followed a direct hiton the steel works.On the following night twenty Wellingtons attacked the Bismark at Hamburgand the target area was heavily bombed, though heavy ground haze madeidentification difficult. Our bombers have also operated against shipping andChannel ports, oil and other industrial targets and aerodromes, as well asarmament factories in Czecho-Slovakia, but results were generally difficult to observe.Great Britain.46. The number of enemy aircraft operating during daylight against this,country was less than half that of the previous week and again consisted chieflyof fighter aircraft, some of which carried bombs.47. Attacks by night were, however, only slightly lower in the aggregatethan during the last period though on no night were so many raiding aircraftplotted as on the 15th-16th October. On the nights of the 20th-21st and the22nd-23rd the major strength of attack was directed against industrial centres in the Provinces instead of London : Coventry, Birmingham and Liverpool beingthe chief cities involved.Gibraltar.41. 1,104 civilians sailed on the Neuralia for the West Indies on the9th October.West Africa.42. The northern detachment of General de Gaulle&apos;s force operating in theGabon has arrived at Mitjik, 150 miles east of Libreville, and the Southerndetachment bombarded Lambarene, 95 miles south-east of Libreville on the23rd October.
48. In London, communications and public utility services appeared to bethe main targets though, as before, many bombs fell some distance from anyapparent objective. In contrast to the incessant attacks previously maintained at night, considerable periods of inactivity occurred during the week underreview. Twenty Royal Air Force Stations were attacked, but with insignificantresults, and the only serious damage sustained by the aircraft industry was to theArmstrong-Siddeley works at Coventry.49. During the week Fighter Command flew an average of twelve sortieseach night and a total of 501 patrols involving 2,142 sorties by day. Details of casulties are given in Appendix V. Our fighters destroyed one enemy aircraft at night and another was shot down by anti-aircraft fire.Coastal.50. During the week 185 anti-invasion and anti-submarine patrols andoffensive and photographic reconnaissances, involving 277 sorties, were flown by coastal Command, including those mentioned in paragraph 44. One hundredand six convoys received air escort. The North Sea sweep was flown by sixBomber Command Blenheims on four days.51. On the 23rd October two Beauforts of Coastal Command attacked a convoy of nine merchant vessels and three escort vessels off Schiermoonikoog.Two ships of 4,000 and 2,000 tons respectively were hit by torpedo, after whichthe&apos; decks of one vessel were seen to be awash, while the second was down bythe stern.52. Enemy reconnaissance activity was normal, and from twenty to thirtyenemy minelaying aircraft operated on six nights, principally off the East Coast.Middle East and Mediterranean.Malta.53.   No air attacks materialised during the week.Egypt and Libya.54. Our aircraft made one daylight and two night attacks on Benghazi;three merchant ships were hit and a large warship and two destroyers at theMolo D&apos;Italia were straddled, while incendiary bombs dropped on the adjacentquay. Fires were also started among buildings and hangars at the aerodrome atBerca in the same area. Attacks were continued on the Italian troops and motor transport in their advanced positions, and on the 21st two Hurricanes assisted,our bombers by machine-gunning working parties and motor transport units,causing casualties to personnel and destroying six or more vehicles. On the two following days Blenheims attacked and straddled the water pipe-line betweenSollum and Buq Buq. Bombs were also dropped on the artillery barracks and fuel cisterns at Tobruk, where explosions were seen, on mechanised transport atBardia and on the barracks at Derna.55. On the 18th and during the following night two formations of threeWellingtons attacked Maritza aerodrome, in the Dodecanese. In the daylight attack hits were obtained on two administrative houses and the corner of a.hangar, but results of the night attack are not known.56. Enemy formations attacked the Alexandria area on the 18th, and onthe nights of the 20th/21st and 21st/22nd. In the first two of these attacks the damage was negligible, and there were no casualties. During the second nightraid the aerodrome at Aboukir was attacked and damage was done to an airscrewshop and to five aircraft. Attacks were also made on Mersa Matruh, Bagush andSiwa with no results other than minor casualties and slight damage to mechanisedtransport.Sudan, Aden and East Africa.57. Our aircraft based in the Sudan continued their attacks on petroldumps at and near Gura and on the aerodrome at Asmara, and several fires were started in the petrol storage areas, bombs also falling among dispersed
aircraft on the aerodrome. Bombing attacks were also made on Kassala,Tessenie and Massawa, where hits were seen on the jetty arid on a group of fighters, on the wharf and aerodrome at Bahar Dar, west of Jibuti, and on therailway station at Agordat. On the 20th October three Blenheims attackedDifnein Island in the Red Sea, and on the 21st a hit was obtained on the sternof an enemy destroyer near Harmil Island. On the 18th October three Gladiatorsdestroyed three enemy fighters and damaged six bombers at Barentu aerodrome.58. Three attacks were made on the aerodrome at Neghelli by aircraft from kenya; pompoms were silenced and motor transport damaged. Three attacks were made on Diredawa by aircraft from Aden but in most cases results werenot observed. Punitive bombing was continued in the Queteibi area of the aden protectorate and several convoys were escorted in the Red Sea, on one occasionan attacking Italian bomber being damaged.59. Formations of three enemy bombers attacked the aerodromes at Buraand Garissa causing slight damage to the latter. In this attack an enemy bomberwas shot down and the crew captured.Persian Gulf.60. On night of the 18th-19th October, three enemy aircraft believed to beCant. 1007 from the Dodecanese attacked the Island of Bahrein and the oil and water pipe-lines on the mainland to the north-west of the island, but little damage was done.  A flight of some 2,600 miles was involved.Air Intelligence.Italy.61. Italian commanders in the Goggiam district of Abyssinia are nowbecoming seriously concerned over the harassing attacks made by rebels in this district. Four sorties had to be made by the Ca.l33&apos;s using bombs and machine-gun fire at Bahar Dar before an Italian column that was being attacked couldextricate itself. The commander at Gondar has requested that certain nativechiefs of proven loyalty should be transferred to this region by air to check the spread of the rebellion.Roumania.62. Formation flights of German aircraft described as bombers and fightershave been seen at Bucharest, but not in great numbers. There are definiteindications that a Fighter Group and a Reconnaissance Group only will be located in Roumania for a beginning, and it is probable that these have arrived.Judging, however, from the number of Roumanian aerodromes believed to havebeen reserved for German use, and the number of German Air Force officers saidto be already in the country, these two Groups may well be only the advancedguard of a much larger force.63. Reports generally agree that all aerodromes and landing grounds in thePrahova valley, in which are situated the most important oil wells, are being placed at the disposal of the German Air Force. The Roumanian squadrons in that area will probably be withdrawn and based on Bucharest and itssurrounding aerodromes. It is definitely established that the Germans have taken over the seaplane base at Constantza, but no German aircraft had arrived thereup to the 12th October.It is believed that the Germans have now some 400 A.A. guns in Roumania.Two hundred of these are in the Prahova valley, one hundred round Bucharestand the remainder along the Danube between Guirgia and Galatz, with someat Constantsa.[21849]

Attacks on aerodromes were on a similar scale to the previous period,and no damage was reported except at Ternhill (Salop), where a hangarwas set on fire, and at Brockworth (Gloucestershire), where very slight material damage and over 30 casualties were caused.A aircraft Factories.66. Mainly as a result of the attacks on Coventry, the number of hits on aircraft factories was rather larger than during recent weeks, but severe damageoccurred only at the Armstrong Siddeley works at Coventry, which were hit on four successive nights, the cumulative effect being extensive damage and considerable delay to production. Production was held up for three days at theBritish Thomson-Houston Co., Ltd., by damage to a gas main.Public Utilities.67. There was very little fresh damage to utilities anywhere during theweek. In London there were small fires at three gas works. The effects of previous hits are still being felt in the form of reduced supplies of gas, water orelectricity.68. As a result of the damage to the New River near Enfield many areas have been without water; 2,000 troops were employed, as an emergency measure,to dig out the old river bed in order to by-pass the break in the pipes.69. To meet the problems raised by damage to water supplies, theMetropolitan Water Board is substantially increasing the number of turncocksin the London area. Large numbers of petrol tankers and milk wagons havebeen brought in to distribute water from door to door.70. Outside London water and electricity supplies were affected at Coventry,while at Birmingham there was temporary interruption of gas and electricity supplies in some districts.Industry.71. There was general industrial damage during the week, but severe damage occurred only as follows : (a) Royal Victoria Dock, West Ham.   Destruction of considerable amountof equipment, plant and stores.(6) Vickers-Armstrong,   Ltd.,   Crayford.    Severe   damage.    Productionaffected in several departments.(c) Midland Tar Distilleries, Ltd&apos;., Oldbury, Birmingham.   Coking plantdestroyed; serious damage to water and steam mains; operations27 per cent, normal.(d) Dubilier Condenser (1935) Ltd., Victoria Road, W.3.   Electrolytic con-denser shop wrecked; three other shops damaged.(e) Henley&apos;s W/T Telegraph Works Co., Ltd., North Woolwich.  Productioncompletely stopped; may be partially resumed in a few days.Railways.72. During the week the railway system suffered fewer direct hits than last week. In London, Broad Street, Fenchuroh Street, Marylebone and CharingCross are closed while services at St. Pancras and Victoria have been severelyrestricted. The marshalling yard at Borderley, Birmingham and the Liverpool -Earlstown line received damage.
Other Damage.73.   Notable buildings damaged  in London were the Treasury   KingHenry VII&apos;s Chapel, Westminster, The National Gallery and the Mint&apos;  Elsewhere, the Deanery at Canterbury and St. Mary&apos;s Hall at Coventry were hitHospitals and kindred institutions continue to receive damage the mostimportant of which has been at the Brentwood Mental Hospital and in birmingham at the Erdington House institution.Residential property continues to bear the brunt of the enemy&apos;s attack   Inaddition to London, Coventry, Liverpool, Birmingham, the Medwav townsSwindon, Hull and Deal are among the worst sufferers.Civilian Casualties.74. The approximate figures for the week ending 0600 hours the23rd October are 1,690 killed and 3,000 injured. These figures include theestimated casualties of 1,470 killed and 1,785 injured in London, 56 killed andand 261 injured in Coventry, and 30 killed and 203 injured in Birmingham.Parachute Mines and Bombs.75. Mines have fallen chiefly in London and Essex, and of the 70 reported45 detonated on impact and 20 have been rendered safe.The total of unexploded bombs in the country remains at about 3,000. Ofthese, about 850 are in the London region, 1,000 in Sussex and Kent and 900 in east Anglia. During the week 1,392 unexploded bombs have been reported. in coventry on the night of the 22nd/23rd October of 60 H.E. dropped 30 failedto explode.Warnings.76. London has had 19 alerts in daylight for a total period of nearly16 hours in all. On two days there were five warnings. Liverpool and birmingham have both had 9 alerts, and Rugby and Bristol 7.77. At night London, Liverpool, Rugby, Bristol and Birmingham have had10, 11, 8, 8 and 7 alerts respectively; but whereas London has been under warningfor a total of nearly 65 hours, the totals for the other warning areas have beenbetween 22 and 29 hours.Civil Defence Operations.78. In London military parties have been a valuable reinforcement to theCivil Defence Services in clearing debris, urgent rescue work and the restorationof water supplies. Six companies of Royal Engineers are now to help with roadrepairs.79. At some of the recent major incidents, where high buildings havecrashed on basement shelters, rescue work has been prolonged and difficult. the speed of clearance has been limited by the physical difficulties of confined space,heavy masonry, girders and flooding.Morale.80. Londoners are feeling the strain owing to lack of sleep and interruption of normal life, but morale remains sound. The spirit of the people as a wholeremains high and there is little evidence of defeatist talk, but there is a certainamount of Communist activity.
