THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.MOST SECRET.W.P. (40) 447.November 15, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ROYAL AIR FORCE TRAINING.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE to the War Cabinet a further report on Royal Air Forcetraining.Acceleration and Expansion at home.2. All the measures of acceleration which I outlined in W.P. (40) 305 ofthe 7th August have now been introduced throughout the flying training organisa-tion in this country. The Elementary Flying Training School courses have beenreduced from 8 weeks to 6* and the Service Flying Training School courses from16 weeks to 10, certain portions of the Service Flying Training Schools trainingbeing transferred to the Operational Training Units. A 25 per cent, overbearingof pupils has been introduced at all Elementary and Service Flying training schools.3. For the three months&apos; period, August to October, the output of the ServiceFlying Training Schools in the United Kingdom to the Operational training units was 2,007 as compared with 1,428 under the original programme. the flow from the Operational Training Units was 1,892.4. The formation of allied squadrons and the absorption of allied personnelinto Royal Air Force squadrons has helped us. In addition to the Dutchpersonnel serving with Coastal Command, there are now 9 Polish and3 Czechoslovak squadrons in the Bomber and Fighter Commands; and some 150pilots from allied air forces are serving in Royal Air Force squadrons. flying training facilities are being organised to enable allied squadrons to be main-tained with their own nationals.5. The improvement that has been effected during the three months&apos; period as a result of these measures is indicated in Appendix A. In the OperationalCommands between August and October a wastage of over 1,400 pilots killed,,missing and wounded has been made good. The pilot strength has been increasedby 700. The Middle East Command has been reinforced; and 300 pilots havebeen sent on the flying instructors&apos; course to provide the instructional staff required for the expansion of 1941.6. We are now reaching the position when our pilot and air crew output is greater than the requirement to maintain the existing establishment of the Force,* The E.F.T.S. course is at present running at 5 weeks to meet the increased S.F.T.S.requirements. Allowance has been made for all training periods to be increased by one-fifth duringthe winter. ,Copy No.[21927]b
and, looking ahead, I anticipate that between the 1st November, 1940, and the1st March, 1941, the accelerated flow of trained personnel will make it possibleto increase the striking power and defensive strength of the Royal Air Force bythe equivalent of 30 squadrons. &apos;A cceleration of Training overseas.7. The Empire Air Training Scheme has made good progress. In Canada,Elementary and Service Flying Training Schools will be operating months ahead of schedule. During the next nine months we shall reap a harvest of 4,600 pilots.Appendix B gives details of this output and Appendix C the dates at whichpersonnel trained under the scheme will reach this country or the Middle East Hfor operational training.8. The measures of acceleration adopted in this country will be introduced by the Dominions as they feel able to undertake them. Canada plans to introduce the shortened 10 weeks&apos; Service Flying Training School course in December.New Zealand is introducing the 12 weeks&apos; course and may be able to change overto 10 weeks.  Australia has introduced a 25 per cent, overbearing.9.   Rapid progress is being made with the development of flying training schools in Southern Rhodesia, and in South Africa.10.   Minor schemes for elementary flying training have been started on theinitiative of the local authorities in Malaya, Burma and the West Indies.A merican Training Schemes.11.   Some progress has &quot;been made in negotiating training facilities in theUnited States.  Three schemes are under discussion.12. The first is designed to give training at selected United States schoolscorresponding broadly to elementary and advanced training in this country.The success of the scheme depends on the release of advanced trainer aircraft bythe United States authorities. This is a matter of the greatest difficulty in viewof America&apos;s own requirements, and, though the President has shown himself tobe favourable, the Air Attache reported that progress would not be possible until after the Election.  The question is now being taken up again.13. A start has been made with a second scheme for using facilities at united States schools to bring candidates from the United States who are alreadyqualified pilots up to the standard for entry into Operational Training Units inthis country. It is hoped that the &quot; Eagle &quot; squadron, the pilots of which are drawn from volunteers from the United States, will be maintained from this source, and that, with the expansion of training in the United States of America,it may be possible to form further American squadrons. The Air Attache has reported that this scheme may also be the best approach to the larger scheme forall-through training.14. A proposal is also being investigated for sending observers for general reconnaissance squadrons through a course recently started by Pan-american airways for personnel of the United States Army Air Corps.15. I should be glad of the authority of the War Cabinet to press on with allthese schemes and in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to conclude the best arrangements that I can.Future development of the Flying Training Organisation.16.   The measures of acceleration introduced at home and already agreedoverseas will produce a further material increase in the flow Of pilots from the    /?Service Flying Training Schools.  Figures are given in Appendix C, which maybe compared with Table A of W.P. (40) 338.17. On passing out of the Service Flying Training Schools, pilots complete their training in the Operational Training Units. For fighters, the operational training Unit period is six weeks, for general reconnaissance pilots eight weeks,in addition to the course at the School of General Reconnaissance, and for bomberpilots ten weeks; thus an average period of at least two months&apos; specialised
operational training must be added to the Service Flying Training School outputdates in order to obtain an estimate of the dates when pilots can be regarded asoperationally qualified.18. The provision of operational training facilities to accommodate the greatly increased flow from the Service Flying Training Schools in this countryand overseas will be a problem of great magnitude, and it. will be necessary to allocate a considerable number of aircraft, personnel and aerodromes to build upthe Operational Training Units throughout the winter and spring.19. In spite of the intensive efforts to obtain an increased number of aerodromes in this country, the demand for operational squadrons and for operational Training Units will be so great that we shall be compelled to reduce to a minimum the number of aerodromes in this country allotted to non-operational training.20. Appendices D and E contain a forecast of the expansion of the flying training organisation as a whole for the various stages up to entry intoOperational Training Units.* The programme has been drawn up on theassumption that the Ministry of Aircraft Production forecast of aircraftdeliveries dated the 2nd October will be realised. It will be subject to delay to theextent that the planned production of trainer aircraft is not achieved. Over and above the planned capacity of the training organisation in the Dominions, itwill be necessary to form Elementary and Service Flying Training Schools, AirObservers Navigation Schools, Bombing and Gunnery Schools and general reconnaissance Schools, requiring in all additional capacity for a pupil popula-tion of over 4,000 pilots and air crew personnel. The instructional and main-tenance personnel will be forthcoming, though a measure of dilution will benecessary.21. As regards aerodromes, the shortage of cement, other materials andlabour makes it impossible, within the time available, to provide in this countryall the sites that we should require for our first-line squadrons, our operational training Units, and our expanding training organisation. Fortunately, with theresources of the Empire at our disposal and an air force organisation already in being in each Dominion, it is not necessary to anticipate that there will be difficultyin finding the sites required. The restrictions imposed on non-operational flying in this country by the risk of enemy attack, and to avoid interference with thedefence system, are well known to the Cabinet. I propose accordingly, while continuing to make the utmost use of all facilities at home, to form our new service Flying Training Schools and other schools overseas to the extent thatmay prove necessary.The completion of the immediate programme for the transfer of schools overseas.22. The War Cabinet will remember that the revised proposals for thetransfer of certain existing schools overseas, Which I put forward in w.P. (40) 351, were approved in principle subject to-review in the light of theprospects of invasion.   I propose that this programme should now be completed.23. There is one alteration. Owing to the j willingness of the Minister of aircraft Production to divert Harvards to Canada for the equipment of No. 10Service Flying Training School, aircraft are now available for the formation ofan additional Service Flying Training School. I should therefore propose toform a new Service Flying Training School in Canada instead of transferringNo. 12 Service Flying Training School, which would involve some disturbancesto output. Moreover, aircraft may be available to form a further school aboutthe time when the move of No. 6 Service Flying: Training: School is due to tokeplace. In this event I should propose, in place of, No. 6 Service Flying training school also, to form a new school overseas.. The numbers of personnel and aircraftinvolved would be the same as stated in W.P. (40) 351.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, November 15, 1940.* In view of variations in the size of schools, the tables have been expressed in terms ofpupil population.[21927]

No provision is made for loss of output due to enemy inter-ference or to exceptionally bad weather conditions.   Allowance is made for lengthening of course in the United Kingdom during the winter. 3.  The output of one Australian School is allocated to the R.A.A.F., and has been excluded from the totals shown.     The. additional output resulting from overbearing of all Australian schools io also taken by the R.A.A.F., and has been excluded from the total shown. 4.   The output of two South African schools is absorbed by the S.A.A.F., and has been excluded from the total shown. 5.   The output from No. 4 S.K.T.S., Iraq, declines because the school is now being partly utilised for aircrew training.	403	710	498	715	822	568	1,059 j 771		840	904	1,574	1,719	1,879	2,139	1,766		408 - 16	510 +185	408 4- 38	510 +157	408 -1-389	408 4-140	671 4-388	564 +207	762 -1- 78	734 +170	1,272 4-302	1,404 4-315	1,691 4-188	1,740 4-399	1,530 4-236
