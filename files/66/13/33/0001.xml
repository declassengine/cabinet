Those in the Moray Firth are being concentrated on the larger ships and by night.   The fact that sinkings anddamageS have not&quot;materially increased, in spite of a greater number of attacks,suggests that the anti-aircraft protection on the East Coast is having its effect.Attack by night still remains a problem to be solved.On other coasts of the United Kingdom, attacks by aircraft show a steadydiminution,jThe most disturbing trend revealed by the figures is the increasing numberof attacks in the Atlantic West of lCPW, where so high a proportion of the losses of valuable ships and cargoes occur and where attacks by long range bombers showa consistent increase.    In the main, they are directed against the large, fast,independent ships and stragglers from ocean convoya 0  The Sierra Leone and gibraltar convoys at present pass within range of this form of attack, but so farhave received only slight attention.   As the number of planes suitable for this form of attack grows, and as we lose any advantage there may be during the nesttwo or three months from conditions of weather, there is reason to suppose thatattacks will increase and extend towards the convoys themselves, making extradiversion necessary, with yet further delays and reduction in carrying capacity.
The prospeot appears to me to call urgently for.-Speo^il measures ofprotection against this now and growing menace to our shipping, under thefollowing, among other, heads:- ,((A) In the last two Gibraltar and Sierra Leone convoys only.4($ of IIthe ships were fitted with High angle A.A. guns* No Allied vessel carries j \a high angle gun or is likely to get one.   I understand that there are small prospects, under present priorities, of merchant shipping receivingadequate supplies of High angle A.A. guns.   The need for every ocean-goingship to be armed with such weapons will become more apparent when the days,begin to lengthen, and it is essential therefore that preparation shouldhe made now.(B) The possibility of carrying one or two fighter planes with everyconvoy should be considered.(O)   The constant and increasing co-operation between shipping and the Coastaland Fighter Commands on the East Coast which should, if possible, be yetfurther developed is essential, if the losses on that coast are to bereduced.(D) Provision of improved methods of fire fighting on board shipmay possibly, in some oases, mitigate the seriousness of the damage&apos;done&quot;by actual hits, and discussions are at present taking place between theAdmiralty and Ministry of Shipping on this subject.   Priority for thesupply of additional equipment should be given if necessary.(E) The operation of reconnaissance planes from Dakar, in collaboration with submarines or the Foldfer planes may require special attention.R0H0 C oMinistry of Shipping.22nd November, 1940*
