THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET.W.P. (40) 465(Also Paper No. C.O.S. (40) 993)November 28, 1940to be kept under lock and key.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET(No. 65)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon November 21st to12 noon November 28th,1940[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff. I
General Review.There has been considerable naval activitj&apos; in the Mediterranean, culminatingin an inconclusive but successful engagement with Italian naval forces.There has been no event of outstanding importance in Home Waters duringthe week.The figures for merchant shipping losses are considerably greater than lastweek, but they include a number of&apos; losses which occurred earlier and have onlynow become known. Sinkings by U-boats have been heavier, and there have been no losses due to air attack.The activities of surface raiders, including the A admiral Scheer, in the south atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans has necessitated a considerable redistribution of our naval forces and the formation of raider-hunting groups.Home Waters.2. On the 23rd November aircraft reported eight enemy merchant vessels30 miles North-East of Ushant, bound up Channel. A force of destroyers was sent to intercept, but did not locate them.During the night the 25th/26th November two enemy destroyers attackedmerchant shipping south-east of the Wolf Rock (Scilly Isles). The Dutch tankerAppollonia (2,086 tons) and some Belgian trawlers which were fishing in thevicinity were sunk. An attempt to intercept the enemy by five of our destroyers,which were 30 miles away from the scene of the attack, was unsuccessful.E-Boats were active on the night of the 24th/25th in the Channel, and were also reported off Yarmouth.The Free French training ship Medoc was mined and sunk off Plymouth onthe 26th November, 39 of the crew being lost and 48 rescued. The Dutchsubmarine O. 22 is overdue and must be presumed lost.H.M.S. Port Napier, a minelayer, was seriously damaged by fire and subsequent explosions at her base on the 27th November. There were no casualties. Eleven auxiliary patrol vessels have been sunk during the week andone damaged by mines.  A detailed list is given in Appendix IV.Dover was shelled daily during the week, but little damage reported.Frater mine depot near Gosport was bombed on the 22nd. Southampton was bombed on the night of the 23rd/24th and the hospital ship Llandoverey Castleset on fire, but it was quickly put out. Plymouth was bombed on night of the27th, two oil cisterns being set on fire and the Royal Marine Barracks damaged.There were a few naval and marine casualties.Faroes.3. Two enemy aircraft fired torpedoes at shipping in Thorshaven on the22nd. The torpedoes exploded on the beach, and there were no damage orcasualties.Australian and New Zealand Waters.4. The Minesweeper Goonambee was sunk in collision with the loss of allhands at P. Philip Victoria on the 20th November.On the 21st the S.S. Port Brisbane reported a suspicious vessel fired on her when 300 miles north-west of the position of the S.S. Maimoa, which had reported a raider on the 20th November when 700 miles west of Fremantle.The Port Brisbane was later reported to be sunk, twenty-seven survivorsbeing picked up by H.M.A.S. Canberra on the 22nd November. Survivorsstated that the occupants of two boats were taken prisoner by the raider.FI.M.A.S. Perth left Fremantle on the 22nd to assist in the search for the raiderreported by these two ships. The sailing of convoy U.S.7 has been delayed untilthe return of Perth and Canberra.S.S. Rangitane, 16,712 tons, reported on the 26th November that she wasbeing attacked by an enemy raider 300 miles East-North-East of East Cape, NorthIsland, New Zealand.  H.M.S. Achilles proceeded from Lyttelton to search.
Meditei&apos;ranean.5. On the night of the 21st-22nd November H.M.S. Aphis, working with aircraft of the Royal Air Force, bombarded Maktila camp on the Libyan Coast.Three large fires were started.   The enemy returned the fire without effect.On the 22nd November the French merchant ship Charles Plunder was intercepted to the east of Gibraltar and sent into that port under armed guard.There has been a great deal of naval activity in the Mediterranean duringthe past week in connection with the passage of convoys and naval reinforcements.Some redistribution of our naval forces took place, and a small convoy of fastM.T. ships, carrying urgent reinforcements and supplies for Malta and theMiddle East, was successfully passed through, the Western Mediterranean.6. In the course of the latter operations early on the 27th November contactwas made with Italian naval forces to the southward of Sardinia. The Italianforce, which was sighted by aircraft in a position about 30 miles S.S.W. off CapeSpartivento, consisted of two battleships and a number of cruisers and destroyers.The British force was in two parts : one, consisting of H.M. Ships Ramillies,Berwick, Coventry and Newcastle and some destroyers, was about 50 miles to thesouth of the Italian force; and the other, consisting of H.M. ShipsRenown and Ark Royal with some cruisers and destroyers, was about 90 miles to the south-westward of the Italians when they were first sighted. both our forces proceeded to make contact, and some three hours later theRenown sighted the Italian battleships at a range of 20 miles. TheItalians retired at high speed towards Cagliari and a chase developed.Our forces engaged the enemy at extreme range, but were unable toovertake them. Fleet Air Arm aircraft from H.M.S. Ark Royal, however,succeeded in attacking with the following results : one torpedo hit on a battleshipof the Littorio class; and one almost certain torpedo hit on an 8-inch cruiser.Another 8-inch cruiser was observed to be in difficulties, and a dive-bombing attack was made on three 6-inch cruisers, probably causing some damage by near misses. The Italians are also believed to have sustained the following casualtiesby gunfire : one 8-inch cruiser probably severely damaged, one destroyer severely damaged and another damaged.7. On our side H.M.S. Berwick was twice hit by 8-inch shell, resulting inshght structural damage and &quot; Y &quot; turret being put out of action. Her casualties were one officer and six ratings killed, two ratings seriously wounded. and sixslightly wounded. All our aircraft returned except one Fulmar, and anotherwhich crashed on landing and was lost overboard.After the action our forces were twice bombed by enemy aircraft without result. In the second attack the Ark Royal was missed by only ten yards by onebomb. Both attacks were intercepted by fighters and two enemy aircraft were shot down.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. Five attacks on U-boats have been reported, one of which was made byan aircraft.H.M. Sloop Rhododendron made a promising attack on the 21st november in the North-Western Approaches, wreckage being seen after the depth chargeexplosions.A Greek destroyer claims the probable destruction of a U-boat in the SkiathosChannel on the 21st November.Enemy Intelligence.German.9. The battleship Tirvitz was seen in the Bauhafen at Wilhelmshaven onthe 23rd November, and three destroyers have been seen at Brest on several occasions. Bad weather conditions have made reconnaissance of German portsdifficult./ italian.10.   Air reconnaissance disclosed the presence at Taranto on the 27th of seven cruisers and fifteen destroyers, in addition to the sunken and damaged.[21961] B
battleships. There were also small forces of cruisers and destroyers of similarcomposition to those mentioned last week in the North Sicilian ports. Therewere four destroyers and one cruiser at Tripoli on the 25th November.U-boats.11. There have been from five to seven German U-boats in the North-WestApproaches in the current week, and two or three Italians in addition. In theearlier part of the week one German may have been further South in the western approaches, possibly on reconnaissance, and there have been indications of onecoming out from Germany and one bound for Lorient. There has been no news of the U-boat off Sierra Leone since the 20th November.Surface Raiders.12. In addition to the reports of surface raiders already mentioned above,a report of a disguised merchant raider off the West Coast of Africa wasreceived on the 23rd November from the S.S. Glenberg, and the British S.S. PortHobart reported she was being shelled on the 24th November, about 500 miles north-East of Puerto Rico.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending Wednesday, the 27th November, 94,550 tons ofshipping has been reported as lost by enemy action, and of this total 61,215 tons were British- Of these losses 11 ships (48,300 tons) were sunk by U-boats, 5 ships by mine (5,770 tons), and 6 ships by surface raiders (32,577 tons). One ship of2,290 tons, additional to those previously reported, is now known to have been sunk by aircraft last week; also included in the figures for this week is a Swedishship sunk at Narvik, the loss of which has only just become known. Full detailsof ships sunk will be found in Appendix I.In addition, the following ships have been reported sunk but have not yetbeen included in the official statistics : S.S. Congonian (5,065 tons) by U-boat off Freetown, S.S. Port Brisbane(8,739 tons) and S.S. Maimoa (8,011 tons).East Coast convoys have been attacked by enemy aircraft throughout theweek without success. Increasing difficulty is being experienced in persuadingcrews of merchant ships to sail in East Coast convoys. Steps which are beingtaken to overcome this reluctance include the provision of fighter escorts betweenthe Sunk and Nore light vessels, and the fitting of kites for defence againstlow flying aircraft.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. 822 ships, including 126 allied and 25 neutral, were convoyed duringthe week ending noon the 27th November; of these, six are reported as havingbeen lost. One battleship, one cruiser, 10 armed merchant cruisers, 2 anti-aircraftships, 38 destroyers and 42 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Total losses since the commencement of hostilities are British 157, Allied 23,Neutral 14, total 194, giving a ratio of losses to numbers convoyed of British 1in 230, Allied 1 in 204, Neutral 1 in 298, total 1 in 232.Owing to raider activities most convoys were held up during the week. Thoseships that did arrive came independently, and figures for imports are not yet available.British Minelaying.15. The chief minelaying operation of the week has been the laying of about,000 mines in the Denmark Strait by H.M. ships Agamemnon, Menestheus,Southern Prince and Port Quebec on the 26th November. FI.M.S. Adventurelaid 280 mines in St. George&apos;s Channel on the 23rd November. Minelaying by aircraft of both Bomber and Coastal Commands has continued off the Germanand Dutch Coasts and the French Atlantic Coast, but still on a small scale.
Enemy Minelaying, British. Minesweeping.Home Waters.16. An acoustic mine has been recovered, and two types of sweep are now working with some success. More are being made and will be at work as soon aspossible. Diesel-engined ships seem to be particularly vulnerable to the acousticmine, and all such ships have therefore received instructions that at certainports they are not to proceed under their own power in water of less than20 fathoms depth.The number of casualties from mines has increased again this week, and itwould appear that the enemy have been dropping more acoustic than magnetic mines. Eleven of the twenty-one casualties which have occurred between the20th November and the 27th November are attributed to the acoustic mine and five to the magnetic type, while four might have been caused by either. One ship is believed to have been mined in a British field to the north of Ireland. Nine ofthe ships mined are auxiliaries.The Thames Estuary appears to have been more extensively mined than other areas, probably because it is both important and easy to reach.Eleven acoustic mines and six magnetic mines have been detonated by mine-sweepers, and four contact mines have been swept during the week in theFalmouth-Fowey Channel.The total numbers of mines dealt with to date are: magnetic 799,contact 729, acoustic 74.German Merchant Shipping.17. An air reconnaissance of Bremerhaven made on the 23rd Novembershowed that either the Europa or. the Bremen was still there. Two smaller linerswhich had been there on the 28th October had left. A reconnaissance ofRotterdam made on the 23rd November showed considerable activity on both navaland merchant vessels under construction. The Dutch Baloeran (17,001 tons),which had previously been laid up, appeared to have steam up.The Lech (3,290 tons) sailed from Vigo on the 20th November and arrivedat Bilbao two days later. The Karnak (7,209 tons) sailed from Vigo on the24th November. The three tankers which are at Vigo, the Antarktis, Brake andNord Atlantic, have taken on board more provisions, and their sailing may havebeen delayed by the bad weather.A report has been received that 17 German ships, totalling 71,762 tons, atTrieste, were getting ready to transport German troops to Albania. Betweenthe 9th and 11th November 200 German seamen are said to have arrived at Triesteto man four of the ships. There are 9 other German ships, totalling approxi-mately 42,000, in other Adriatic ports.MILITARY   SITUATION.Germany.18. The identification of two new divisions brings the total of identifieddivisions to 213.The Balkan States.Greece and Albania.19. The outstanding feature of the Greco-Italian war during the past weekhas been the capture of Koritsa by the Greeks, and the rout of a numericallysuperior and better-equipped but demoralised Italian Army, along practicallythe whole front. Everywhere the Greeks have advanced into Albanian territory :in the Northern Sector as far as Pogradets (on the road to Elbasan) and Voskopoja(nine miles west of Koritsa) without meeting the enemy. In the Pindus sectorthey have taken Ersek, Leskovik, and the heights beyond. In the Epirus sectorfighting continues in the Kakavi area (near Jerousat) where the Italians are trying to hold the road to Argyrokastro. In the coastal area the Italians arefleeing north from Konispol, and the Greeks have landed a small force fromCorfu in order to cut the enemy&apos;s line of retreat.
The first position on which the Italians may make a stand is the line Elbasan-Valona. This covers all the coastal plain of Albania and abandons the mountaincountry in which the Greeks have met with such success.Reports indicate that two Italian Army Corps, or formations thereof, a,rebeing sent to reinforce the Albanian garrison.Bulgaria.20. The possibility of removing all military stores and personnel from Sofiaand declaring it an open town is under consideration. The movement of troops to the south and south-east continues, and the&apos;road down the River Struma isreported to be undergoing extensive repairs south of Simitli. -The importance ofthis road lies in the fact that it leads to the Rupel pass, and is the principal route for an attack on Salonica from the north.Middle East.Egypt.21. The First Flight of the 7th Australian Division arrived at Suez on the23rd November, 1940.A successful raid was carried out by our troops in the area South ofSidi Barrani . on the 20th November, resulting in 5 enemy tanks and other material being destroyed and casualties being inflicted.The Italians appear to be still concentrating on improving their lines ofcommunication, and have made no attempt to advance.Sudan.22. During the last week our forces at Gallabat have continued to harassthe enemy at Metemma.  Patrol activity north of Kassala continues.Crete.23. The 2nd Black Watch disembarked at Suda Bay on the 19th november and joined Creforce.Far East.24. It is stated, on good authority in Indo-China, that there is no knowledgeof the warship and transport concentrations off Saigon mentioned in certain press reports; nor is there any knowledge of a Japanese demand for the right to landtroops at Saigon.AIR SITUATION.General Review.25. Attacks by aircraft of Bomber Command on military objectives inGermany and the occupied territories have been made on each night of the weekexcept one, when all operations were cancelled owing to adverse weather conditions. On two nights during the week industrial targets were attacked inNorthern Italy. Coastal Command carried out successful attacks against enemyports, aerodromes and shipping.German attacks on this country have been on a reduced scale, but have been concentrated on our ports and industrial centres.Our fighters have again been very successful in their attacks on daylightraiders.Our aircraft have actively co-operated with the Greek forces and carried out succesful attacks on Bari and on the base.ports in Albania.Operational Aircraft Battle Casualties and extracts from recent Raid Assess-ment Reports are given in Appendices V and VI.
Germany and Occupied Territory.26. A total of 39 day and 414 night sorties were flown by Bomber Commandduring the week. In addition, a number of bombing sorties were made by aircraft of the Coastal Command. The principal 1 features of the week&apos;operations have been the concentrated attacks which have been carried out againstindustrial and communication targets in the Cologne area, and a heavy attackon the aerodrome at Bordeaux, at which the Focke Wolf Condor aircraft are reported to assemble for operations against shipping in the North-western approaches. Military objectives in the Berlin area were attacked on two occasions.27. On the night of the 22nd/23rd twenty-four heavy bombers attacked the aerodrome at Bordeaux; twenty-nine tons of high explosive and two thousandeight hundred incendiaries were dropped. The attack appears to have been most successful. Direct hits were obtained on hangars and barrack blocks, and manyaircraft on the aerodrome were seen to be on fire. The hangars on the south-westside of the aerodrome were completely burnt out.28. The concentrated attacks on industrial and communication targets inthe Cologne area were carried out on the nights the 26th/27th and 27th/28th,when twenty-nine and thirty aircraft respectively were employed. Among theprincipal objectives attacked were the Hohenzollern Bridge, the Deutz railway station, several Marshalling Yards, the Electricity Power Station, an ArmamentFactory and the Inland Port. Reports indicate that extensive material damage was caused.29. Military objectives in Berlin were attacked on the nights of the23rd/24th and 26th/27th, when a total of nineteen heavy bombers were employed.Twelve tons of high explosive and many incendiary bombs were dropped. the objectives attacked were the Tempelhof, Pulitzerstrasse and Lehrter marshalling yards; the Potsdamer, Pulitzerstrasse, and Schlesischer railway stations; theWilmersdorf Electricity Power Station and a number of A.A. concentrations.Weather conditions precluded precise observation of results, but many fires and explosions were reported.30. On two successive nights the inland port of Duisburg-Ruhrort was attacked by a total of thirteen aircraft. Bursts were seen in the centre of the target and a series of fires were started.31. A number of successful attacks have been made on the enemy&apos;s synthetic oil industry. The Krupp oil plant at Wanne Eickel was attacked by eighteenmedium bombers. Direct hits were reported in the centre of the target anda large fire was observed. Other successful attacks were made on.oil plants at hamburg, Dortmund and Gelsenkirchen.32. In addition to the attacks on marshalling yards at Cologne, the enemy&apos;srailway system has suffered seven attacks over a wide area. Ten aircraft attacked the marshalling yard at Dortmund and caused extensive fires, whilst a lighterscale of attack was directed against similar objectives at Gelsenkirchen, Leuna,Duisburg, Hanover, Hamm, Soest and Schwerte.33. The enemy&apos;s shipbuilding industry has also suffered attacks. The Blohmand Voss yards at Hamburg were attacked by twelve aircraft on the night of the24th/25th and many bombs were seen to burst in the target area. On the following night operations were carried out against the dockyard at Wilhelmshaven andthe shipbuilding yards at Kiel, but heavy cloud prevented accurate observationof results.34. The Naval base at Lorient has been attacked by aircraft of bomber and Coastal Commands, and the latter also attacked the docks at Brest. successful attacks (have been continued against the Channel Ports. In addition a numberof other targets, including many enemy aerodromes, seaplane bases and factories,,have been bombed. Leaflets have been dropped by aircraft over Belgium and theLille-Paris-Brest areas.35. A number of daylight attacks by the cloud-flying Blenheims have beencarried out, but on a restricted scale owing to unsuitable weather conditions.[21961] c
sGreat Britain.36. Fighter Command flew 682 patrols, involving 2,694 sorties by day and168 sorties by night. This was a reduction in the number of sorties overthe previous week and was to some extent a reflection of the very considerable reduction in the scale of effort of the German Air Force which was at its lowestfigure for many months. Our fighters, however, continued to maintain a very high ratio of victories to losses of aircraft, thirty-two enemy aircraft being destroyed for the loss of only four fighters and one pilot.37. The reduction in day activity was partly due to bad weather, but itmay also have been due to a desire to build up the fighter force. The enemyemployed a heavier scale of attack on the 23rd November in which some thirtyItalian fighters participated. Seven of these were destroyed together with fourGerman fighters, against which we sustained no losses. Our fighters were againvery successful on the 27th November when twelve enemy fighters were destroyed for the loss of only two of our aircraft, both pilots being saved. No dive-bombershave been seen in action during the week.38. The scale of attack employed by the enemy at night was less than half that of the previous week, the decrease being almost certainly due to bad weather.&quot;Weather conditions were, however, favourable on the night of the22nd/23rd November and a serious attack was made in the Midlands andparticularly against Birmingham. The tendency to continue with concentratedefforts against individual industrial centres was again evident. Southamptonwith a subsidiary attack on Portsmouth was selected one night, while bristol and the area surrounding was attacked on the three successive nights, on one ofwhich three of the attackers were destroyed by A A. fire. Plymouth was alsoheavily attacked.39. Other districts including the Home Counties, the South-East Counties,the Merseyside and London were also attacked, but comparatively lightly. Onthe night of the 25th/26th November there were no attacks on London.Coastal.40. Coastal Command has continued to carry out routine, special andoffensive patrols, reconnaissances and convoy escorts.- A total of 224 patrols and reconnaissances, involving 402 sorties, were flown and 108 convoy escortswere provided. Minelaying in enemy waters was successfully carried out by19 aircraft from Bomber and Coastal Commands.41. The most notable feature of the week&apos;s operations has been the numerousattacks made by our aircraft against enemy shipping. In some cases results werenot observed, but in four instances most successful results were obtained.42. On the 26th November a Hudson on patrol near Borkum bombed a merchant vessel of 3/5,000 tons and it is believed a direct hit was made. On the27th November a Beaufort, on offensive patrol 8 miles N.N.W. of Terscheiling,attacked with a torpedo a 5,000-ton merchant vessel and registered a direct hit.On the same day another Beaufort, 16 miles north of Wilhelmshaven, madea similar attack on a tanker of about 7,500 tons; the vessel was hit amidships,burst into flames and was seen to be sinking by the stern. Also on the 27th aBlenheim attacked a 4/5,000-ton merchant vessel in the Estuary of the Weser,and the ship sent out an S.O.S.43. In Norway attacks were made on the aerodromes of Sola and Kristian-sand and on the wireless station at Vikero Island.44. Minelaying by enemy aircraft was continued during the week onapproximately the same scale as the previous week. There were few attacks onour shipping by German aircraft and no ships are reported to have been sunk.Enemy air reconnaissance has continued over a wide area.
Italy, Greece and Malta.45. Bombing attacks on objectives in Northern Italy by aircraft of bomber Command operating from this country have been carried out twiceduring the week. &quot;During these operations the Royal Arsenal at Turin was attacked with good results, and hits were registered in the centre of the Fiat blastfurnaces and steel works, and on the Fiat aero-engine factory. Bari was attacked by Wellingtons from Malta and damage was caused to the harbour installations,the Central Railway station, and the Oil Refinery. Another Wellington droppedits bombs on the entrance to the inner harbour at Taranto.46. In Albania, although weather conditions were unfavourable, our aircraft have carried out attacks on enemy bases, aerodromes and on theretreating troops. On the 24th November nine Blenheims attacked Durazzo, andhits were scored on a 10,000-ton ship and on a smaller ship, which caught fire.Heavy A.A. fire was encountered during this attack and four of our Blenheimswere damaged. One force landed at Corfu but the crew were saved. During anattack on Valona hits were registered on a large ship believed to be a warship.47. Military concentrations at Argyrokastron and Tepelene were success-fully attacked by three Blenheims, and in the Elbasan area a low-flying attackon enemy columns by eight Gladiators caused panic and confusion. further attacks were made on the Italian line of retreat at Pogradec, and fires and explosions resulted. The Gladiators maintained standing patrols over the Greekforward positions, but Italian air activity was on a small scale. On the27th November our fighters intercepted three C.R. 42&apos;s, one of which was shot down in flames, and another probably destroyed.48. At Malta Italian aircraft were active and attacks were directed mainlyagainst aerodromes. The attacks were, however, generally ineffective. a low-flying attack on Luqa aerodrome by six C.R. 42&apos;s resulted in one Wellingtonbeing destroyed and three others damaged. Our fighters intercepted the enemy and during one engagement one C.R. 42 was destroyed. A.A. fire accounted for another Italian fighter.Egypt and Libya.49. Our Air Forces in the Middle East have continued their offensive opera-tions against the Italians in Libya, and attacks have been mainly directed against military targets in the vicinity of Benghazi, Tobruk, Derna and Bardia.On several occasions barracks, important buildings and motor transport vehicles were hit. Landing grounds were also successfully attacked, and fires followed&apos;by explosions were started on the slipway at Bomba.50. No attacks of importance were carried out by the enemy. On the24th November four bombers attacked Mersa Matruh, but only succeeded incausing damage to a telephone cable. Single aircraft bombed Alexandria,resulting in slight damage to two houses and a factory.Sudan and East Africa.51. Aircraft operating from the Sudan and Aden continued their attacks on enemy targets in Abyssinia and Eritrea. The South African Air Force carriedout similar operations from Kenya. Gura, Asmara and Massawa were againbombed, and an attack on the transport park at Assab resulted in an extensivefire. The railway at Agordat was attacked and direct hits were scored on thepermanent way. At Gubbi, bombs fell in the centre of the camp and a building was hit during an attack on the W/T station at Ffarat Island.52. In Northern Abyssinia Wellesleys bombed and hit buildings at Asosaand Salena. Troop concentrations at Danglia (40 miles South of Lake Tana)and near Metemma were also attacked.53.   Operations by the enemy were on a negligible scale.   Two night attacks were made on Aden by enemy aircraft, one of which was located by searchlights Iand shot down in flames by a Gladiator.
Air Intelligence.Italy.54. The strength of the Italian Air Force in the Western Sector of Libya is apparently being appreciably increased. About fifty additional bombers havebeen permanently transferred, and there are definite indications that furtherbombers are due to arrive shortly from Italy. It is reliably reported that a numberof modern fighters are expected in the near future.Greece.55. The present strength.of the Greek Air Force is given as about sixtyaircraft, half fighters and half bombers, of which some are unserviceable.Bulgaria.56. A German Mission is reliably reported to be making an inventory of spare parts of all Bulgarian aircraft.  These are all of German or Czech types.Sweden.57. The United States authorities have been negotiating for the retentionof 110 aircraft which have been manufactured for Sweden. These negotiations have now broken down and the aircraft have been requisitioned.Russia.58. In spite of the inclusion of two Deputy Commissars for the aircraft industry in the retinue of experts which accompanied M. Molotov to Berlin, it isbelieved that little of importance was effected at the meeting with Hitler.Iraq.59. The Iraq Government has arranged to buy a small quantity of anti-aircraft equipment from Japan.Japan.60. No further information has been received as to the destination of the bombers, approximately 100 in number, which were recently reliably reported tohave been withdrawn from Hanoi to Hainan island. Considerable air reinforce-ments have, however, been sent recently to the Marshall Islands, andit is possible that some of these may have been withdrawn from China at aboutthe end of September.HOME  SECURITY SITUATION.General.61.   The extent of enemy air activity is summarised under Air Situation.The outstanding events of the week have been concentrated night attacks onBirmingham for the third time in four days on the 22nd / 23rd November, onSouthampton on the 23rd/24th November, on Bristol on the 24th/25th november and on Plymouth on the 27th/28th November.Summary of Air Raids.(a) By Day.62. The most noteworthy of the daylight attacks were made on Petersfield(where an infirmary was hit and 5 people killed), Yarmouth, Chelmsford andHornchurch on the 21st, when raiding was comparatively widespread over Essex;at Eastbourne on the 22nd, Sheerness on the 23rd (on which date also some 24 H.E.fell harmlessly at Grantham); at Bexhill on the 24th and at Whitstable on the25th.   The 26th was a day of even less activity, affecting only the South-East.On five days of the period no enemy aircraft penetrated to London; on the23rd there was bombing in a number of London boroughs early in the morning,and on the 25th there were only two minor incidents reported in the Region.
(b) By Night.63. On the night of the 22nd/23rd a concentrated attack was made onBirmingham. Over 300 fires were reported by 2230, when there was ,a temporarylull. The attack was resumed, however, and by the end of the raid at 0538 therewere some 500-600 fires, all of which were quickly got under control. The nextnight, the 23rd/24th, an intensive attack was made on Southampton, and considerable damage was done by fires started by I.B.&apos;s. A heavy raid was madeon Bristol on the following night, the 24th/25th, where again many fires were started, and again on the night the 27th/28th a similar attack was made on&apos;Plymouth, where a serious fire was started at the Oil Depot at PlymptonSt. Mary.Damage.A aircraft Factories.64.   The works of Aero-Engines, Ltd., at Kingswood were damaged.Public Utilities.65. Water supply services were severely damaged at each place intensivelyattacked which increased the difficulty of fighting the fires. The position is nowsatisfactory.66. Considerable damage was done at the Wailasey Docks of. the MerseyDock and Harbour Board, and temporarily to Littlebrook Electric Power Stationnear Dartford.67. There was a fire at the Birmingham Corporation Gasworks and the bristol Gas Company suffered damage.Industry.68. Among the Key Points hit, substantial damage has been done to thefollowing :  (a) Wright, Bindley and Gell, Ltd., Percy Road,  Greet, Birmingham.(Detonator parts.)(b) Abingdon Works (1931), Ltd., King&apos;s Road, Tyseley, Birmingham.(Tools and Kit Bags.)(c) B.S.A.   (Guns),   Ltd.,   Armoury  Road,   Small   Heath,   Biimiingham.(Machine guns.)(d) Reynolds Tube Co., Ltd., Hay Hall Works, Tyseley, Birmingham.   (Steelnon-ferrous tubes.)(e) The   National   Smelting   Corporation,   Avonmouth,   Bristol.     (Zincproduction.)(/) The Roadless Traction Company, Hounslow.Railways.69. L.M.S. and GW. Railways around Birmingham and Bristol were severely damaged, but the situation has been steadily improving.Other Damage.70.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Berlin-Siemens are stated to have ceased production and to be proposing totransfer to Vienna. They have cancelled orders from Iran and some of their employees are now temporarily unemployed and on half pay.The Halensee Station, the Moabit Station, the Tempelhof Propeller factory and the Stettiner Station have been damaged. The Osram Factory has been hitagain and further damage caused. The largest warehouse of a boat-buildingcompany was destroyed by fire and the wharves of that company hit.Hamburg: The raids of the 15th and 18th November are stated to havebeen the heaviest of the war. Six factories were destroyed and dumps of warmaterial hit. A kerosene depot was fired and an important railway stationdamaged. Blohm and Voss shipyards were heavily damaged. In addition manybombs were dropped in the neighbourhood and damage was done to private property, casualties being severe.Two destroyers nearing completion have been hit and severely damaged.An annexe to a factory dealing with raw rubber has been hit and the contentsrendered useless.On the night of the 11th October the building of the railway directorate was hit and bombs fell in the vicinity of the Altona Railway Station. On the night of the 21st October warehouses in a number of which grain was stored were fired.Bremen.-On the 28th October one German and one Finnish ship were sunkin the harbour basin and sheds and buildings near Dock 2 and the harbour railway station were badly damaged.Hoescht: The explosives factory &quot; Farbwerke &quot; (previously reported hit)was again hit towards the end of October and severely damaged by fires which took three davs to extinguish.Leverkusen. I.G. Farben are said to have closed down owing to extensive damage.Industry. The Benz Motor &quot;Works at Mannheim and the Aneg Turbine andthe Bergmann Works at Berlin are stated to have ceased production.There is a growing tendency to transfer industry from areas that have been consistently attacked to the East of Germany or Austria so as to be out of range of aerial attack. A Swedish shipyard is receiving orders for the repair of german ships on account of damage to, and the danger of air attack on the yards in north-West Germany, and no improvement in the delivery of coal to Sweden hasbeen effected, delays still being frequent.Mining. About the middle of September seven ships damaged by mines were at the Holtenau end of the Kiel Canal and there were ships similarly damagedat Brunsbuttel. In the early part of September two Danish ships were damagedjust North of Taarbaek. In the early part of October the S.S. Kobenhavenof 1,700 tons was damaged in the Sound and there are rumours that the linerBerlin of 15,300 tons, which left Copenhagen in September, has been mined and sunk.Ships have been sunk off the Norwegian Coast as a result of aerial mining,and the Germans and the Swedes have reached an agreement under which theywill each keep their own half of the Elsinore-Helsingborg Channel free frommines. A similar agreement with regard to the Trelleborg-Sassnitz route isunder consideration.
