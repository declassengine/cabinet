EXTENSION OP DANGEROUS AREAS IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL ANDCOPY NO..T.5.devious%ferences:JP.(40) 311.M.225 (40)conclusion,minute 3THE BAY OP BISCAY.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.&apos;The present western boundary of the English Channel and Bay of- . ,Biscay &quot;sink at sight&quot; zones passes within,only 10 miles of Ushant, and&apos;the Vice Admiral of Submarines has asked that it should be moved a little to the westward.     I accordingly propose that the zones should be extendedto give a depth of 70 miles off Ushant and that in consequence a, notice, tomariners should be issued declaring dangerous to shipping all waters in.the English Channel and Bay of Biscay eastward of a line joining the-. :- ..:following positions:- -(a) the Bishops Rock Lighto(b) latitude 49Q52&apos;N. longitude 07o W. .(c) latitude 46o30rN. Longitude 07o *v7.(d) Le Socoa Light.2.     The object of the extension is (a) to give our submarines moresea room off the French Atlantic Coast, especially in the Ushant area where the enemy is active;-(b) to enable our submarines to attack anyvessels encountered whilst they are going to and from their patrolstations;   there is a considerable movement of enemy shipping in thewhole Bay of Biscay area;    (c) to confer on our aircraft the similaradvantage of a wider area in which they will be able to attack allshipping at sight.3.     No new question of policy is involved in this proposal since the enlarged area will not interfere with freedom of navigation to Spanishports and no neutral shipping enters the Channel except under the guidance of our own naval authorities.     All ships sailing to and from united Kingdom ports will be directed to obtain routeing instructionsto take them through the area.4.     Annexed hereto is a draft, notification to neutral Governmentsamending the western boundaries of the English Channel and Bay of Biscayzones.A.V.A.Admiralty, S.W.1*October 27, 1940.
