They foresee a longwar and fear a general spread of communism as a result. They donot consider the present moment opportune for any peace initiative.(2) Lack of harmony between the Axis partners is evidenced both by theprevention by Mussolini of the German attempt at a rapprochementwith France at the cost, of Italy, as also by the lack of co-ordination in connexion with the Italian campaign against Greece.(3) Molotov&apos;s visit to Berlin is regarded in Vatican circles as a gesture of support to Germany devoid of any real value, yet so in accord withthe Soviet policy of nourishing the war. This causes apprehensionand concern at the Vatican.(4) Graziani&apos;s Libyan offensive is held up through lack of water and difficulties relating to supplies. A special water system is in courseof building.   Distilling of sea water has proved unsatisfactory.(5) The Greek campaign was insufficiently prepared militarily and isunpopular in Italy.11219   [21951]
(6) The Dodecanese is suffering from serious lack of,petrol caused by the dislocation of sea transport.(7) R.A.F. air raids and bombings are having a deeply depressing effect upon the Italian population, which expresses itself in anti-governmental reactions.(8) Fascist circles threaten to apply decisive reprisals.I am,Dear Lord Halifax,Yours sincerely,AUGUST ZALESKI.
