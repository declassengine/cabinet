THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 141.5th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE QUESTION OF BRITISH NATIONALITY FOR POLISH SOLDIERS,SAILORS AND AIRMEN.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.IN the Prime Minister&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on the27th February (Official Report, Col. 1284), he said : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s government recognise that the large forces of Polish troops soldiers, sailors and airmen now fighting gallantly, as they have fought during the whole war, under british command, owe allegiance to the Polish Government in London. .... HisMajesty&apos;s Government ar4e resolved that as many as possible of the Polish troopsshall be enabled to return in due course to Poland of their own free will andunder every safeguard to play their part in the future life of their country.&quot;In any event His Majesty&apos;s Government will never forget the debt theyowe to the Polish troops, and for all those who have fought under our commandI earnestly hope it may be possible to offer the citizenship and freedom of theBritish Empire if they so desire. I am not able to make a declaration on that subject to-day because all matters affecting citizenship require to be discussed between this country and the Dominions . . . ., but, so far as we are concerned,we should think it an honour to have such faithful and valiant warriors dwellingamong us as if they were men of our own blood.&quot;2. I understand this declaration to mean that, subject to the concurrence of the Dominions, the Government will if need arises ask Parliament to amend the nationality law so as to facilitate the conferring of British nationality on members of the Polish forces, and that the case for giving special privileges inthe matter of British nationality to members of the Polish forces will only arise if the arrangements with regard to Poland should turn out to be less satisfactorythan we hope, with the result that it is difficult for those who have swornallegiance to the Polish Government in London to return to Poland.The record in the War Cabinet Conclusions (W.M. (45) 23rd Conclusions,Minute 2, 21st February) of. the circumstances which occasioned this offer make sit clear that the object was to meet such a situation as would arise &quot; if in the last resort all failed and Polish troops in Western Europe or elements of them feltthat they could not return to Poland under the new conditions.&quot; The inferencewas that the question of granting British nationality to members of the polish forces would not arise unless the difficulties of the Polish situation should befound to be unexpectedly serious. My own recollection is that the War cabinet discussion was not of a decisive character.3. The Prime Minister&apos;s declaration of the 27th February may, however,be interpreted as indicating that even if no such acute difficulties arise HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be glad to offer British nationality to such membersof the Polish forces as may desire it. It is, of course, to be hoped that the greatbody of the Polish forces will be ready and willing to return to Poland, but evenif the Polish situation develops in a satisfactory manner there will no doubt be many individual Poles who will prefer for one reason or another to remain inthis country if they are allowed to do so. Even, therefore, if the Polish situationdevelops so satisfactorily that there is no case for special legislation extendingBritish nationality to members of the Polish forces, the Government will be pressed, in view of this declaration, to allow individual members of the Polish[29367]\/ Copy No.
forces to remain in this country if they desire to do so and to naturalise under -the existing law those who make application as soon as they have the requisitestatutory qualifications. . -&apos;*4. There are large numbers of Poles serving not in the Polish forces butin the British forces, particularly in the Air Force. From, time to time Questionshave been asked in Parliament about naturalisation of these Poles serving in theBritish forces, and I have stated in reply that there are large numbers of foreigners of various nationalities who are rendering valuable service to the war effort either in the fighting forces or in civilian occupations, that many of thesedesire British nationality and that I could find no grounds for picking out thePoles for preferential treatment. Questions may be expected in the near futureasking whether I propose to modify this attitude in view of the Prime ministers statement of the 27th February.5. Many representations have been made to me to the effect that british nationality ought to be granted to all aliens of good character who are serving with the British forces. These representations have been directed mainly to securing the naturalisation of those Germans and Austrians (mainly Jewish)who were admitted to this country as refugees and have joined the Pioneer Corpsor other units. I have hitherto felt it impossible to differentiate between thosealiens who have assisted the war effort by enlistment in the Services (a high proportion non-combatant) and those who have assisted in a civilian capacity.Amongst those who have joined the Pioneer Corps are some whose main object was to find a method of release from internment, and of these many were discharged on medical grounds after limited periods of service.There are no doubt many others who are whole-hearted supporters of theAllied cause and have rendered good help. Many of these people who areprompted by a sincere desire to overthrow Nazism, would, if they had beenresiding in the country of an Ally, have joined the Forces of that country; andthe fact that in order to assist the United Nations they have joined the british forces is hot necessarily a reason why all of them should be given british nationality. In any case it would be unjustifiable to treat service with the forces as a ground for preferential treatment in the matter of naturalisation, since thiswould mean giving preferential treatment to a class of applicants which includessome individuals whose claims are less deserving than those of Germans and austrians who have been rendering as scientists or technical experts, &amp;o, valuablehelp in a civilian capacity to the war effort.If now or in the near future naturalisation were to be offered to individualPoles who have served either in the Polish forces or in the British forces, itwould be impracticable to refuse naturalisation to persons of other nationalities,including Germans and Austrians, who have served in the fighting forces.6. If it be suggested that a differentiation can be made between Poles andaliens of other nationalities because of the political difficulties of the Polishsituation, this will lead to indefinite repercussions. There are amongst the aliensin this country of various nationalities many who will claim to be out of sympathy with the Government of their country of origin, including not only Germans and austrians but some of the Czechs and persons possessing Yugoslavian or Greeknationality, and possibly nationals of other countries.7. In the Report* of the 24th February from, the Committee on the reception and Accommodation of Refugees, attention was called to the difficultieswhich will ensue if the United Kingdom takes unilateral responsibility for any large-scale scheme of resettling Polish nationals and if large foreign elementsare allowed to settle in this country after the war.The Government will have to consider at an early date what the policy is tobe after the end of hostilities in Europe as regards the many aliens of variousnationalities who have been admitted to this country for temporary refuge, andit is most desirable that decisions on the general problem should not be prejudiced beforehand.8. In these circumstances it is, I suggest, essential that if questions aboutnaturalisation policy are addressed to me, I should be authorised to make it clearthat the Prime Minister&apos;s offer of British nationality to members of the polish forces was a contingent offer made to meet a situation which, it is hoped maynot arise; that there is no question of differentiating at the present time infavour of applications for naturalisation from Poles;  and that the intention* W.P. (45) 113.
of the Prime Ministers statement was to indicate a readiness to deal in a specialmanner with members of the Polish forces if at a future date it should be found,despite our hopes to the contrary, that a Government is not established in Polandwhich is acceptable to the main body of Poles who have been fighting underthe Allied Command.9. If that situation should arise there is unlikely, I imagine, to be any difficulty so far as the Dominions are concerned in making an alteration of thelaw relating to British nationality. The admission of Poles to british nationality will not give them any right of entry into the Dominions, since theDominions under their own legislation have power, to refuse admission to Britishsubjects. Under the law of the United Kingdom, however, there is no powerto refuse admission to British subjects, and the grant of British nationalityto Poles would mean that they would have a right to settle in the United kingdom but not that they would have a right to settle in other parts of the BritishCommonwealth. It is much to be hoped that a situation in which we are obligedto offer British nationality to large numbers of Poles will not arise. If andwhen it should arise, it will be necessary to consider carefully how to presentthe case for differentiating in favour of the Poles with a view to avoiding anygeneral policy of accepting as British subjects, with a right to permanent residence in the United Kingdom, all those many aliens who desire to stophere and claim that they have rendered assistance to the war effort of the united nations. .      .H.
