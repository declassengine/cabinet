naval SITUATION.General Review.I. A convoy from North Russia has arrived in Home Waters.Enemy coastal shipping has been successfully attacked by HM. S/M States-man in the Malacca Strait.U.S. carrier-borne aircraft have again attacked Tokyo.Shipping casualties have been caused by E-boat minelaying on the convoyroute to Antwerp.One U-boat has been sunk, two probably sunk and one possibly sunk.Home Waters. , %2. * A convoy of 30 ships, escorted by ships of the Home Fleet, has arrived in Home Waters from North Russia. Two of the escorts and one ship in the convoy were torpedoed shortly after leaving Kola Inlet (reported in last week&apos;resume). On the 23rd, after the convoy had been scattered by a gale on theprevious day, one of the stragglers was torpedoed by aircraft S.E. of Jan MayenIsland; 65 survivors, including Norwegian women and children, were picked upby H.M.S. Opportune (destroyer). On the 27th, another straggler reported enemy aircraft in her vicinity north of the Shetlands.3.^ On the 22nd, a tank landing ship was torpedoed and sunk, possibly bya midget U-boat, east of Ramsgate; 220 survivors were landed. On the same dayM.L.s sank three midget U-boats N. W. of Flushing and took two prisoners. shore batteries sank another on the 24th off Flushing..4. H.M.C.S.

On the 25th HM.trawler, Ellesmere, escorting an outward-bound convoy, was torpedoed and sunkN. of Ushant; the convoy was not attacked.5. On three nights of the week E-boats, probably minelaying, were activeon the convoy route to Antwerp and were engaged by our patrols. Two E-boats were sunk and 49 prisoners were taken.6. On the night of the 23rd, the French destroyer La Combattante was sunk by mine or midget U-boat off the Humber; about 60 of the ship&apos;s company are missing. On the 25th, a cable ship was sunk, probably by a mine, east ofRamsgate and on the following day a wreck dispersal vessel was damaged by a mine off Ostend.7. During the week ending the 25th, the combined British and U.S. dis-charges through the liberated ports were 105,000 men, 12,000 vehicles,408,000 tons of stores, 32,250 tons of bulk coal, 116,500 tons of petrol and72,500 tons of ammunition.Mediterranean.8. Allied warships have continued to bombard enemy positions on theFrench-Italian frontier.9. Under cover of fire from both gun landing craft and aircraft, coastalcraft have assisted in the evacuation of partisans from Pag (N.W. of Zara),which was necessitated by a strong enemy counter attack.10. H.M.S. Active (destroyer) captured a landing craft containing14 Germans between Rhodes and Piscopi. .East Indies.II. Burma coast operations on Ramree Island are reported virtually ended.The blockade by small craft with army machine gun sections embarked, hasaccounted for 200 of the enemy killed since the 8th.H.M. destroyers Rotherham, Roebuck, Rapid and Rocket, during a sweepoff the Andamans, shelled the radar station on Great Coco Island and probablyput it out of action.12. H.M. S/M Statesman during a recent patrol in the Malacca Straitsank three coasters and an armed trawler in convoy and seriously damaged two
other coasters which were forced to beach. Later she set on fire a small tankerand damaged two coasters by gunfire. Two junks were also sunk and threeprisoners were taken. -Pacific;Philippines.13.   The harbour of Manila is now open to the Allied fleets.On the night of 20th/21st, U.S. coastal forces blew the stern off a shipsouth of Tufon and on the night of 22hdy23rd, sank three troop-carrying barges and destroyed another barge which was beached in the same area. On the 24th,coastal craft, with covering aircraft, sank.ten motor boats and other small craftS.W. of Mindoro.Japan.14. On the 25th, U.S.,carrier-borne aircraft made another heavy attack oninstallations in and around Tokyo. It is reported that during this and theprevious-attacks, 223 Japanese aircraft were destroyed or damaged and 17 ships were probably sunk. No U.S. ships were damaged during the attack but two ships were damaged as the Fleet retired.Java Sea.15. During a recent patrol ELM. S/M Spark sank a tug and two coastersoff the north coast of Java.Anti-Submarine Operations,16. Thirty-four attacks were reported during the week, of which 12 wereby shore-based aircraft and 22 by surface craft.On the 22nd, a U-boat was sunk by H.M.S. Recruit (minesweeper) off CapeSt. Vincent; prisoners were taken. On the 24th, frigates of the 3rd.escort groupprobably sank one off land&apos;s End, and on the 27th, H.M.S. Loch Fada (frigate,2nd escort group) probably sank another off the Lizard; two survivors wererescued.  On the 17th, a U-boat was mined and possibly sunk in Oslofiord.Enemy Intelligence.17. Reconnaissances on the 21st showed the Koln in dock at Wilhelmshavenand the Hipper and Emden at Kiel. On the 28th, the Number g was seen atCopenhagen.It is reported that a Russian submarine sank the German depot ship WilhelmGustloff, 25,484 tons, with 6,000 persons on board, including U-boat officers andratings, in Danzig Bay, on the 30th January.U-boats.18. There has been an appreciable increase in U-boat activity in the S.W.approaches.Reconnaissance of Rotterdam on the 26th, showed seven midget U-boats inthe. flooded floating dock and on the same day nine midget U-boats were seen inthe North Sea Canal.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. During the week ten ships, totalling approximately 35,000 tons, were sunk by enemy action. Three coastal convoys were attacked by U-boats in the Channelbetween Falmouth and Land&apos;s End and three ships were sunk. Two ships,sailing independently, were sunk; in the St. George&apos;s Channel. One ship in coastal convoy was sunk by U-boat or mine off Berwick and another ship was damaged by mine off the Wash. Three ships in convoys to and from Antwerpwere mined and sunk off Ostend. A ship in convoy to Iceland (C) was torpedoed and sunk off Reykjavik. A straggler from a Russian convoy was torpedoedby aircraft and sunk, and a ship at Antwerp was damaged by aircraft.20. Provisional shipping losses by enemy action during February were18 ships of 76,107, tons.
Allied Minelaying.21. Surface craft have laid mines in Home Waters. Aircraft, includingcarrier-borne aircraft, have laid mines off the Norwegian coast and in theKattegat.   Aircraft also laid mines in the Malacca Strait and Gulf of Siam.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.22. E-boats probably laid mines off the S.E. coast and on the Thames-Scheldt convoy routes on three nights during the week.Twelve mines were, destroyed in the approaches to the Humber.Minelaying is. suspected in the Gulf of Genoa. *Akyab harbour and its approaches are reported to be clear of mines.By the 16th, 170 mines had been swept in the harbour at Manila and itsapproaches.The mine totals are 6,390 ground and 8,897 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23.   The withdrawal of troops across the Skagerrak from Norway continues. at an appreciable rate.It was reported at the end of January that no further shipments of coal to norway would be made, but s.s. Stanja (1,845 tons) and Las Palmas (2,317 tons)have left Copenhagen for Norway with coal. The renewal of coal shipmentsindicate that it is considered essential to continue the supply for the purposeof maintaining rail and sea transport for the movements of troops.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.24. During the week there has been little to report from the SouthernSector.In the Eifel the Third U.S. Army has driven the enemy eastwards from the siegfried defences, while a further thrust east of Luxembourg has cleared thetriangle between the Saar and the Moselle. East of Aachen the Ninth U.S. Army,supported by the First U.S. Army, has launched a strong offensive across theRiver Roer and driven a deep penetration into the enemy defences on a front of over 35 miles. Julich, Duren and Erkelenz have been cleared of the enemy and forward troops are across the River Erft and on the outskirts of Munchen-Gladbach and Rheydt.In the North, the First Canadian Army has continued to make steady progress southwards between the Maas and the Rhine against heavy opposition.Southern Sector.   .25. South of Strasbourg, activity has been limited to patrolling and small-scale raids by the enemy from across the Rhine.In the Saar the Seventh U.S. Army has reached the outer Siegfried defencesin the vicinity of Saarbrucken and little further progress has been made duringthe week. Fighting has continued in Forbach where U.S. troops hold over two-thirds of the town.Central Sector.26. In the Eifel the Third U.S. Army&apos;s converging thrusts north fromEchternach and south from Prum, made contact N.E. of Vianden on the 24th.The advance then turned N.E. against decreasing enemy resistance and reachedthe line of the River Prum on the 26th. The Americans are now across thisriver on a front of 12 miles, and leading troops have reached the River Kyll east of Bitburg, and, striking S.E. are threatening Trier from the north. further south the attack launched eastwards from Remich across the Moselle has maderapid progress. Saarburg was cleared on the 22nd and two bridgeheads estab-lished across the Saar north and south of the town. Organised resistance ceasedin the triangle between the Moselle and Saar the following day. On the 26ththe two bridgeheads were linked up and the U.S. formations pushing eastwardsand N.E. have made advances of up to 6 miles to threaten Trier from the south.
The First U.S. Army put in a strong attack across the River Roer in thevicinity of Duren on the 23rd. The attack provided right flank protection forthe Ninth US. Army to form a continuous front east of the river. Duren was cleared on the 25th and the advance penetrated up to 6 miles beyond the townthe following day. By the 28th leading troops had advanced more than 12 miles .E. of Duren and were across the Erft Canal at two points east of Elsdorf;stiff fighting is now in progress for the possession of the high ground to theeast of the Canal.Northern Sector.27. Early on the 23rd the Ninth U.S. Army launched an offensive north-eastwards across the River Roer and established five bridgeheads on a 15-milefront from south of Julich to north of Linnich. These bridgeheads were quicklymerged into a firm lodgment area and linked on the right to the bridgeheadsmade by the First U.S. Army. The towns of Julich and Linnich fell on the24th and by the 26th the combined penetration by the two&apos; armies had reached a depth of 7 miles on a 25-mile front. On the 27th, a further advance of 8 milescut the Munchen-Gladbach-Roermond road North of Erkelenz, while furthereast leading troops reached the River Erft at Konigshoven. U.S. forces haveclosed in to the outskirts of Munchen-Gladbach and Rheydt and are thrustingN.E. towards Neuse. On the left of the Army front advances up to 6 mileswere made north of Heinsburg during the 27th/28th.In the north the First Canadian Army has continued to make steady progressagainst stiff enemy opposition. U.K. troops advancing S.W. from Goch occupiedthe high ground between that town and Udem by the 25th, and on the rightpressed forward towards Weeze. On the left, ILK. and Canadian troops launcheda strong attack south-westwards towards the Hochwald Forest on the 26th. Udemand Calcar were cleared by the 27th and our troops are now engaged in heavy fighting within the Jlochwald Forest south and S.W. of Udem.Russian Front.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Latvia.28.   The Germans have continued to report the repulse of Russian attacks in N.W. Latvia; no mention of these attacks has been made by the Russians.East Prussia.29.   On the 26th, the Germans reported that a part of the garrison ofKoenigsberg broke out to the west and established contact with German forces inthe Samland peninsula; by this action the Germans have probably been able to restore road and rail communications between Koenigsberg and Pillau (a port.on the Frische Nehrung).Central Sector.30. Increasing enemy resistance and probably Russian supply difficulties have contributed to the slowing down of the present offensive in most areas ofthe Central Sector. In the area of Neustettin, however, the Russians, after four days&apos; fighting, broke through the German positions on the 27th and advancedup to 45 miles. On the &apos;28th, Neustettin itself was captured and the russians had advanced to within 30 miles of the Baltic coast.Further west on Marshal Zhukov&apos;s front, there has been no advance, buton the 23rd, the vital communications centre of Posen was completely taken.This should ease considerably the problems of supply to this sector.In lower Silesia and Brandenburg, the Russians have reached the R. Neisseon a broad front and have&quot; thus come into line with the southern flank of theRussian forces facing Berlin.Southern Sector.31. The Germans have been counter-attacking with some success along thenorth bank of the R. Danube. They claim to have reduced the Russian bridge-head over the R. Ffron in this area.
Italy.32. The Italian Front remains quiet with activity being confined chieflyto patrol work and artillery duels.On the western side, however, U.S. and Brazilian troops have been engagedsince the 19th, in limited operations designed to capture some important heights,which lie to the west of the Pistoia-Bologna road. The enemy was caughtunprepared when these operations began but resistance soon crystallised; never-theless, our objectives have now been captured.Burma.33. On the coast of Burma, one of our battalions had broken out fromthe bridgehead at Ruywa, and advanced 5 miles to the east.The village of Saw has been occupied by Allied troops. The bridgehead overthe Irrawaddy, established ,on the night 13th/14th, has been enlarged. forces are advancing up the road from Nyaungu towards Myingyan.Heavy fighting has taken place around the village of Talingon, in ourbridgehead 30 miles west of Mandalay. Casualties to the enemy have been heavy.Patrols from our bridgehead at Thabeikkyin and Kyaukmyaung have linked up.There is thus a clear corridor between the two bridgeheads.In Northern Burma, British troops have made a slight advance towards MongMit, from which they are now 12 miles. -Chinese troops have made progress in the areas 10 miles south and 8 miles.E. of Namtu. They have also made advances, against opposition, 10 miles S.E.and 8 miles south of Hsenwi..Pacific.Philippines.34. Luzon. On the 26th, General MacArthur&apos;s communique stated thatthe last Japanese pocket in Manila had been liquidated and tehe Bataan Peninsulahad also been cleared of Japanese.Heavy fighting has continued on Corregidor, the island commanding the entrance to Manila Bay, where the Japanese are established in tunnels whichthe U.S. forces are mopping up.Other TJ.S. forces have made small advances eastward from Manila, cap-turing the town of Montalban, and southward down the western shore of theLaguna de Bay, the large lake south of Manila.Kazan Islands.35. I wo Jima. Fighting has continued on Iwo Jima, where the 4th and 5th U.S. Marine Divisions have been reinforced by the 3rd U.S. Marine Division.About the 24th, U.S. marines cleared Suribachi Volcano, thus eliminating theJapanese on the southern end of the island.Since that date they have made further advances northward from their original positions, and now hold part of No. 2 airfield, and are working round the western end of the airfield.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.36. Fighter Command flew 80 defensive sorties; two aircraft are missing.Attacks against long-range rocket sites are referred to in paragraph 38, whiledetails of rocket activity against this country are reported under &quot;Enemy activity and Home Security.&quot;Home Waters.37. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 924 sorties; four aircraft are missing.Attacks were made on shipping in the Skagerrak and Kattegat and off theDutch Coast; one 5,000-ton ship, two 4,000-ton ships and one E-boat were seton fire, and seven ships, totalling 30,000 tons, and an escort vessel were damaged.Bomber Command aircraft laid 344 sea-mines.
Western Europe..38. In the week ended dawn on the 28th, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) flew22,143 sorties and dropped 11,166 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawnon the 1st March, aircraft of Bomber Command and the US. VIII bomber command flew 13,038 sorties and dropped 30,187 tons, while Fighter command and the US. VIII Fighter Command flew 6,603 sorties. One hundred and twenty-six enemy aircraft were destroyed; 292 Allied aircraft are missing, but some ofthese may have landed safely on the Continent.Enemy air. activity was largely committed to defence of the Army&apos;s linesof communication. The tactical fighter effort was on an increased scale and atthe end of the week averaged 200 sorties a day.Heavy bombers dropped nearly 21,000 tons of bombs on railway and industrial centres in Germany, the principal targets being Berlin (2,498 tons), Leipzig(1,724 tons), Pforzheim (1,547 tons), Mainz (1,545 tons), Munich (1,455 tons),Essen (1,171 tons) and Cassel (1,098 tons). Five important bridges and viaductsin the Bremen, Bielefeld, Paderborn and Dortmund areas were attacked, 960 tonsbeing released.Five thousand tons were dropped on 7 benzol and synthetic oil plants in theEuhr, 900 tons on 5 oil refineries in the Hamburg and Hanover areas and 240 tonson an underground oil store at Neuberg (25 miles N.E. of Augsburg).Among other targets attacked were U-boat building yards at Hamburg and bremen (798 tons), two airfields in South Germany (379 tons), tank plants atAschaffenburg and Friedrichshafen (237 tons) and&quot;Horten dockyard, near Oslo(223 tons).Some of the targets referred to above were attacked visually, while others were attacked through cloud with results which are believed to.be good. Photo-graphs show a large area of Pforzheim destroyed and the goods yard burnt out,considerable fresh damage at Essen, heavy damage to oil installations andindustrial plants at Hamburg, two oil plants on fire in the Ruhr, a railwayviaduct near Paderborn partially destroyed and severe damage to the dockyardat Horten.Mosquitoes bombed Berlin on every night of the week, and Spitfires success-fully attacked rocket sites in Holland. Fighters which escorted the heavy bombers attacked communications and airfields, destroying or damaging about300 locomotives and 1,700 road and rail vehicles, and at Weimar and Gotha 100aircraft on the ground.In the battle areas, Allied aircraft co-operated closely with the troops.Widespread attacks were made on communications, defended localities, gun positions and ammunition dumps; 1,000 locomotives, 15,000 road and rail vehicles,many bridges, gun positions and. barges were reported to have been destroyed or damaged and railways cut in about 1,000 places.Appendix VII gives raid assessments.Southern Europe.39. In the week ended dusk on the 26th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew15,599 sorties (including 4,168 by heavy bombers) and dropped 10,836 tons of bombs. Three enemy aircraft were destroyed; 104 Allied aircraft (including32 heavy bombers) are missing.Enemy air activity continued on a low scale.Successful attacks were made by the Strategic Air Force on a number ofimportant railway centres in Austria, South Germany and Italy, on which a totalof 6,400 tons of bombs was dropped. The main targets were the Vienna area.(1,030 tons), Augsburg (979 tons), Linz (806 tons), Verona (628 tons) and Worgl(40 miles N.E. of Innsbruck-333 tons), on all of which, according to photographs,good concentrations were achieved. An effective attack was also made on the navalarmament depot at Pola (230 tons).The Tactical Air Force continued to attack enemy communications inNorthern Italy, especially on the Brenner route; 77 bridges, 174 locomotives and several hundred road and rail vehicles were destroyed or damaged and railwaysand roads were cut in many places. Attacks were also made on enemy targets inthe battle area, airfields, two sugar refineries and a cellulose factory.Aircraft of the Balkan Air Force attacked shipping in the Adriatic; a4,000-ton minelayer at Fiume and two 600-ton ships off Pola were damaged.^ In Yugoslavia, small-scale attacks were made on enemy communications, gun positions and harbours, and close support was provided for Partisan forces.
Russia.40. Ground-attack aircraft of the Russian Air Force operated in strength,especially against targets on the East Prussian Front. Long-range bombers attacked several targets, including Stettin, Stargard, Koenigsberg and Breslau.G.A.F. activity was on an increased scale, particularly on the borders ofSilesia and Saxony, where attacks were made on Russian forces advancingtowards Dresden, and in East Prussia, where air support was provided for german troops seeking to force a way through from Koenigsberg to the coastat Pillau.Far East.South-East Asia.41. In the week ended dusk on the 26th, Allied aircraft flew 4,462 sorties,including 3,219 by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition, Dakota transport aircraft flew 5,046 sorties carying 3,800 men and 8,335 tons, and light transport aircraft flew 2,199 sorties, carrying 706 men and evacuating 565 casualties andmen.   Eight Allied aircraft are missing.Enemy air opposition throughout the period was negligible.In Central- Burma, tactical aircraft continued to co-operate closely withAllied troops on all sectors of the front; enemy communications were effectivelyharassed and ammunition and supply dumps set on fire. Liberators also operateddaily with success against enemy positions, airfields and supply areas to the southof Mandalay, a total of over 1,100 tons being dropped, whilst Mitchells carriedout similar missions against targets an the areas near Wundwin and Ngazun(67 miles south and 37 miles west of Mandalay respectively). Beaufightersoperated against communications, particularly river-craft on the Irrawaddy, ofwhich some 300 were destroyed or damaged.In Lower Burma and Siam, Liberators successfully attacked rail targets, inone instance 100 feet of the central span of the important bridge 20 miles southof Uttaradit was destroyed.In Malaya, 105 Super Fortresses bombed&apos; the Empire Dock area at Singapore;over 200 tons were released in good visibility with good to excellent results. Therewas little enemy opposition and only one of the attacking force failed to return.Equally good results are reported from other attacks by Super Fortresses on therailway installations at Kuala Lumpur (165 tons) and on the airfield at Alor Star.Liberators laid over 150 sea-mines off South Burma and in the waters betweenPenang and Sumatra.Pacific.42. In the Philippines, on Luzon, Liberators attacked enemy positionswest of Fort Stotsenburg on three occasions, a total of over 450 tons being dropped. The airfields of Lucena and San Roque were also bombed by liberators. Bostons and tactical aircraft continued to operate in support ofAllied troops. The town and airfield at Basco (Batan Island, N. of Luzon)was attacked by a force of 50 medium bombers. The majority of operations against other Philippine Islands were undertaken by Corsairs, which made some 40/80 sorties daily, primarily against airfields on the islands of Mindanao,Negros, Panang and Cebu. Liberators made two successful attacks on barracksnear Davao, whilst Bostons inflicted severe damage to installations at PuertoPrincessa.No air activity by the enemy other than on a small scale has been reported.In Formosa, 100 sorties were flown by Liberators against Takao, whilstan attack by two groups of these aircraft raised large fires in Heito. Mitchellssuccessfully bombed the rail centre and barracks at Choshu, and enemy installa-tions at Koshun, whilst fighters destroyed 13 enemy aircraft on the ground atKarenko. In the course of anti-shipping operations in these waters, Liberatorssank two and damaged five seatrucks and sank 6 small vessels, including twobarges carrying troops, off the Okinawa Islands.In Borneo, Liberators obtained excellent coverage on airfields, against which some 180 sorties were flown. Considerable damage is also reported to have been caused by an attack by Bostons on the railway installations at Jesselton.In the South-West Pacific, some 600 sorties were flown against targets in the Wewak, Kavieng, Rabaul and Bougainville areas.
. ENEMY ACTIVITY AND HOME SECURITY.General.43. During the past week long-range rocket attacks on this countrydiminished, 45 incidents compared to 66 the previous week. Of these, 21 occurred in London, 19 in Essex, 4 in Kent and 1 in Hertfordshire.Important key points suffered serious damage in warehouses at docks andin a large sewage outfall, where flooding also affected railway sidings. In morethan half the incidents only minor damage was reported.In only 3 incidents were civilian casualties at all numerous : 13 killed,12 serious; 6 killed, 21 serious; 6 killed, 13 serious.Casualties.44.

APPENDIX YII.Allied Air Attacks on Germany.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Altenbeken. Photographs taken on the 22nd February after the bomber command attack on the same day, show that the railway viaduct has been cutat the point where it leaves the eastern embankment. One span has been almost completely destroyed.Bochum.-Photographs taken on the 22nd February show that as a result ofthe 8th Air Force attack on the 19th February, considerable and widespreaddamage has been caused throughout the Carolinengluck coking plant. nearly every unit has been affected, some of them severely. The most important newdamage is to one of the coke oven batteries (No. 2), where the gas main lias beensevered and some of the ovens probably damaged.It is believed that the plant will be inoperable for another two weeks, andthat production will then be limited to 50 per cent, of normal for a further two weeks or longer.Bottrop / Welheim. Photographs taken on the 19th February after the bomber Command attack On the 3rd / 4th, cover the western one-third of the cokingplant of Rheinische Stahlwerke A.G., and show that here damage is very severe.Dortmund. Photographs taken on the 21st February after the bomber command attack on the 20th/21st are largely covered in the centre of the townby heavy cloud. It can be seen, however, that further severe damage has been caused to the south of the city centre and south-west of Dortmund-Sud Station.Many fires were still burning at the time of photography.The same cover shows further damage to the synthetic oil plant ofHoesch A.G. (Eving) which was attacked by aircraft of U.S.A.A.F. on the19th February.  There will be no production, for at least one month.Duisburg. Photographs taken the day after the Bomber Command attackon the 21st/22nd February show many fires still burning, and extensive freshdamage in the.town.
