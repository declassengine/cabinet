(44) 239). The Committeehave now presented their Second and final Report setting out further progress which the Committee have made and, in particular, setting out the result of theirenquiries into the probable demand in particular professions and callings for persons with higher qualifications. We circulate it herewith for the informationof our colleagues. -        -o^- ...... t..,,,..^.^.^E. B.T. J.R. A. B.2nd March, 1945.INTERDEPARTMENTAL STANDING COMMITTEE ON further education AND TRAINING.Second Report.Part I.-Introduction.SINCE the First Report was presented in April 1944 there has been some change in membership of the Committee. For convenience a copy of the terms ofreference and of the present membership of the Committee are attached(Appendix I).The Committee have now held 15 meetings in all. In addition, the StandingSub-Committee under the presidency of the Chairman have held 45 meetings forthe purpose of taking evidence.2. In their First Report the Committee analysed the problems with whichthey have to deal, and indicated the lines on which they were proceeding. Theobject of the Second Report is to show the action which has already been taken onthe recommendations made in the First Report, to make further recommendations as necessary, and to present a statement, based on the evidence which has beenreceived, on the prospects in the main professions and similar callings. (Annexattached.)Part II. Progress since First Report.,3. It will be convenient to take the conclusions and recommendations of theFirst Report in the order in which they are set out in the Summary (Part IV) ofthe First Report, and to state how these matters now stand.(a) Advice on Training and Careers (Sections (i) and (ii) of Summary of first report).4.   Members of the Services will shortly be given a Government Bookletentitled Release and Resettlement, in which there will be a section dealing with[29154] copy No. oD
the Further Education and Training Scheme. They will also be able to obtain ahandbook entitled Careers for Men and Women to be issued by the Ministry ofLabour and National Service, containing a brief statement about the prospects ofemployment and training in the various professions and callings, based on theconclusions reached by the Committee. Pamphlets are also being prepared by thesame Ministry on individual professions and callings, which will give detailed information about training, entry, qualifications, salaries, &amp;c, including conces-sions in respect of length and conditions of training which will be available to ex-Service men and women. Arrangements are being made with the Services bywhich these publications will be made available, on application, to individual members of the Services. Persons who have been in war service other than theFighting Services will be able to obtain them from offices of the Ministry of Labourand National Service.These documents are now ready for printing.(b) Probable Demand for Persons with Higher Qualifications (Sections (iii) and(iv) of Summary of First Report).5. In reaching conclusions about prospects of employment, the Committeehave kept in mind not only the probable conditions immediately after the war but,so far as possible, long-term requirements : it would, in their opinion, be wrong to base conclusions about prospects in the professions and similar callings on a con-sideration of temporary conditions due to the immediate aftermath of the war.6. It may be assumed that the Committee&apos;s main conclusions on prospectswill not need radical alteration in the light of events, so long as a high and stable level of employment is generally maintained and employers adopt an enlightenedattitude. It will, however, be a function of the Appointments Department of theMinistry of Labour and National Service to pay continuous attention to the trendsof employment in the professions and similar callings, and to adapt their advice on prospects to the current situation.Evidence of Demand.7. A large body of evidence has now been taken from Government Depart-ments, professional institutions and representative organisations on the probabledevelopments after the war in various fields of activity, and their effect on thedemand for persons with higher qualifications. A list of those who have givenevidence is contained in Appendix II. The Committee have reached the general conclusion, which is stated in detail in the Annex to the Report, that a substan-tially greater demand may be expected than before the war for persons with higher qualifications, especially in pure and applied science.Demand in Industry and Commerce.8. The factors affecting the long-term demand for persons with higherqualifications are, however, highly complex, especially in the industrial and commercial field : the problem cannot be reduced to a simple calculation of avail-able work and jobs to be filled. As pointed out in para. 10 of the First Report,the trend of administrative and technological development in industry and com-merce and the attitude of employers to the recruitment of persons with higherqualifications may be more important factors affecting demand than the general level of employment in particular industries.9. The distribution of the expected demand between different sections ofindustry is at present uneven. Industries such as electrical engineering,chemicals and petroleum, which have been accustomed to recruiting persons with higher qualifications and regard such recruitment as an important part of theirpolicy, account for&apos; a large proportion of the increased demand expected after thewar. There is, so far, no firm indication of substantially increased demand fromindustries, such as coalmining and some of the textile industries where the pro-portion of qualified persons recruited has previously been comparatively low.10. It is clear from the evidence that the expected demand from industryand commerce for more persons with higher qualifications does not imply ademand that university courses ,should be more specialised or vocational&apos; incontent (cf. para. 13 of First Report).
11. A number of the larger employers, including Local Authorities, havefurnished, in response to an enquiry by the Ministry of Labour and NationalService, . estimated of their probable requirements for persons with higherqualifications after the war, as compared with the present and pre-war number employed. The information obtained from these returns generally confirms theconclusion stated in para. 7 above, and has been taken into account in reachingsome of the conclusions in the Annex.-   Overseas Demand.12. In the absence of information as to the extent of the demand in anyDominion for the recruitment from outside of persons with higher qualifications,the Committee have made no allowance for possible openings in the Dominions.Other openings overseas, including the requirements of the Colonies, for persons with higher qualifications, both in Government service and in commerce, havebeen taken into account in the conclusions in the Annex on prospects in particularcallings.(c) Number available for training (Section (v) of Summary of First Report).13. On further consideration, the Committee do not recommend the generalissue of a questionnaire to members of the Forces for the purpose of estimating the number who are likely to apply for training under the Further education and Training Scheme. Such an enquiry would be likely to give rise to widespreadexpectations which might be incapable of fulfilment, and the statistical results would not be of practical value to the award-making Departments.(d) Selection for awards under the Further Education and Training Scheme(Section (vi) of Summary of First Report).14. The award-making Departments the Ministry of Labour and NationalService, the Education Departments, and the Agriculture Departments aretaking steps to ensure that applicants for awards will be interviewed by localadvisory panels set up by the Ministry of Labour and National Service, or by such other special methods as may be appropriate.(e) Deferment from Military Service of University Arts Students (Section (vii)of Summary of First Report).15. This question is under consideration by the Ministry of Labour and national Service, in consultation with the Committee of Vice-Chancellors andPrincipals.(f) Educational and Training Facilities (Sections (viii)-(x) of Summary of First -Report).The Services.16. The War Office and Air Ministry have prepared schemes of education and pre-vocational training for the release period. Some sections of the armed forces will continue to be employed operationally, and others will be kept in readiness for any military need that may arise. The schemes cannot therefore beapplied universally at any one moment. Subject to this, a definite number of hours each week will be set aside in working or training time to enable men andwomen of all ranks to pursue courses, where necessary by correspondence, or totake part in discussions and practical work in the directions which interest themand are likely to be of value to them on their return to civil life. The close linkthat has been forged with the Universities and other educational institutionsis being maintained and strengthened.17. The courses and practical occupations will in the main be general, butsubjects and activities more directly connected with vocations and trades will find a place, as well as those which relate to life in society generally. a relatively small number of courses will be provided on a selective basis in preparation for professional and trade qualifications, and any direct vocationalpreparation that is given will be planned in close relation to the government training schemes.18. The Admiralty have prepared a scheme on similar lines, but it isexpected that the greater part of the Navy will still be employed operationally.Attention is being given to the problem of providing as much instruction aspossible under these conditions.[2915&apos;4] B 2
Universities and Technical Colleges.19. In the academic year 1938-39 there were 50,000 full-time students atthe Universities, divided among the different Faculties in the followingproportions :     &apos;Arts    ...      .......... ... 22,374Pure Science ...      ....    ... ...      - - - 7,661Medicine......       ...      ....... 13,636Applied Science       ...       ... .... 6,331&apos;     &apos; &apos;     50,002The Universities regard it as essential to the resumption of their fullactivities that staff absent on &quot;war service should be enabled to return to the universities, and, that requisitioned buildings should be restored, at the earliestpossible moment after the cessation of hostilities with Germany. The Committeeunderstand that these questions are under consideration by the ministers concerned. On the assumption that requisitioned buildings will be so restored,it should be possible even in the first two years after the end of the German war to find accommodation for approximately the same number of students as in1938-39.On the other hand, the immediate provision of adequate teaching for sucha number would present difficulties, as, even with the return of staff now absenton war service, there will be other vacancies due to death or retirement which itwill take time to fill satisfactorily.20. The extent and timing of the demand which may be made on universityaccommodation are dependent on factors which cannot at present be determined with any accuracy. From the information at their disposal, the Committee have formed the opinion that pressure upon university accommodation in the first twoyears after the end of the German war is unlikely to be as- great as it will becomelater. The release of students from the Forces may be expected to extend over aconsiderable period of time, and the conditions&quot; on which boys may be permitted to enter Universities direct from school will depend upon the current war situation. Consequently, in the Arts Faculties in particular, which before thewar comprised 45 per cent, of the total student population, the number in the first two years after the end of the German war will, it is expected, fall short of thepre-war level and may well be, in general, within the compass of the teaching staffthen available. In the Science Faculties the position is less clear, since thenumber will to a large extent depend on the speed of release from industry andthe availability of potential students at present in civilian employment.21. The Education Departments estimate that the Technical, commercial and Arts Colleges and Schools will be able to provide accommodation to meet anydemands for further education and training likely to be made on them in the first two years after the end of the German war.Supply of Books.  &apos;22. It is of great importance that an adequate supply of educational booksshould be available. The Committee recommend that this question of supply should continue to be carefidly watched by the Departments concerned.(g) Future Scope of Higher Education (Sections (xiv)-(xv) of Summary of first report).23. In their First Report the Committee suggested that a permanentincrease will be desirable probably some 50 per cent, over-all as compared with pre-war in the number of students taking courses of university and comparablestandard. The Committee, without wishing to make specific recommendations about the number of persons who should be encouraged to take particular courses,are satisfied from such further evidence as they have received that their previousestimate will not be excessive, having rega,rd to the requirements of the country.They believe that an adequate supply of potential students will be available fromthe secondary schools of the future, provided that sufficient encouragement is forthcoming, where needed, in the form of financial assistance.
24. While, so far as can be foreseen, pressure to accept students in excessof the pre-war level is likely to begin and gradually intensify about two yearsafter the end of the German war, it is clear that this ultimate increase in thenumber of students taking courses of higher education will entail not only an expansion of accommodation, but also development on a considerable scale ofthe teaching facilities in Universities and Technical Colleges. The committee consider that these matters require urgent and careful attention.25. The Annex to this report indicates the advice which the Committeehave received as to the extent to which an increase in the annual intake to particular professions and callings may be called for. The Committee recommendthat advice on prospects based on the Committee&apos;s conclusions and on the informa-tion on trends of employment collected from time to tim,e by the AppointmentsDepartment of the Ministry of Labour and National Service should be madeavailable to Universities and, to secondary schools.(h) Opportunities for courses overseas under the Further Education and training scheme (Section (xi) of Summary of First Report).26. A number of those eligible under the Further Education and training scheme will wish to take courses at Universities in Dominion or Allied countries.The Committee recommend that the Departments concerned should make arrange-ments for enabling in suitable cases those eligible tender the Further education and Training Scheme to take coxirses at institutions overseas.Representatives in this country both of the Dominions and the United Statesof America have indicated that students from the United Kingdom would receive a warm welcome in their respective Universities and technical institutions. Thevalue of such arrangements in promoting mutual goodwill Can hardly be over-estimated, and the Committee feel that every advantage should be taken of this opportunity. The scale on which any such scheme might operate is dependentupon factors which cannot at present be determined. The Committee considerthat a suitable class of students for such a scheme would be those who havealready taken some part of a university or technical college course, or thoseneeding a post-graduate course.^Accommodation for students from overseas in. the United Kingdom (Section(xii) of Summary of First Report).27. The immediate problem is the provision of short courses up to sixmonths in United Kingdom Universities and Technical Colleges for members ofthe Dominions and Allied Forces, between the end of hostilities with Germanyand their return overseas.The Ministry of Labour and National Service and the Education Depart-ments are making the necessary arrangements with the Dominion and AlliedService authorities, and with the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.On the assumption that there will be a sufficient interval between the end of theGerman war and the return, in substantial numbers, of United Kingdomstudents from war service, it is estimated that about 2,000 places can be provided in Universities, and at least 1,000 in Technical Colleges.28. Apart from this immediate question, the Committee understand thatthere are plans for encouraging, on a long-term basis, overseas students Colonial, Dominion, Allied and others to take normal courses of higher education in this country.In view of the probable pressure on accommodation the committee recommend that the Education Departments should make suitable arrangements to co-ordinate these plans tvith the requirements for the training of;*UnitedKingdom students in the early post-war years.(j) Practical Training in Industry and Commerce (Section (xiii) of Summary off first Report).29. The Minister of Labour and National Service has approachedindividually a number of firms about arrangements for practical training, of.persons who have been on war service to equip them for managerial and executiveposts. A number of schemes are under consideration, and the Ministry of Labourand National Service are now making a wider approach to industry and commercethrough employers&apos; organisations.
30. The Committee wish to place on record their appreciation of the valuable services of their Secretary, Mr. F. M. H. Markham, throughout the18 months of this enquiry, and especially for his assistance in the drafting ofboth the First and Second Reports, as well as of the services given, more especiallyin the preparation of the Annex to the Report, by Miss J. Morris (Ministry ofLabour and National Service), acting as assistant secretary to the Committee. -Signed on behalf of the Committee :- HANKEY, Chairman.Privy Council Office, -December, 1944.&apos;    APPENDIX I.Terms of Reference.To consider in the light of the prospects of employment at home and abroad (a) the number of persons who should be encouraged to enter upon courses of education and training above the secondary school or equivalentstandard;(b) the opportunities for education and training above secondary school or equivalent standard which should be made available to men andwomen who have been engaged in service or work connected with thewar, and to co-ordinate these with the corresponding opportunities to be provided by the Services for those still engaged in those Services.II.

2. In January, 1940, the total membership of these professional institutionswas 33,440. Of these 11,210 were engaged in practice as accountants or employedin firms of practising accountants and 22,230 were employed in industry, com-merce or elsewhere. The&apos; average number of articled clerks and registeredstudents who were admitted to. membership of the professional institutionsannually in the years 1935-39 inclusive was 1,500 and in the years 1940-43inclusive was 700. -3. The number of articled clerks and registered students whose training has been interrupted by war service is approximately 6,350. ....4. It is expected that an increased number of qualified accountants will berequired after the war in industry and commerce, and, to a lesser extent, in private practice. The factors making for increased demand will be the growing com-complexity of taxation, amendments to Company Law now under consideration, andthe growing tendency to employ persons with accountancy qualifications formanagerial functions and in costing.5. A substantial number of accountants have been recruited by GovernmentDepartments during the war and a proportion of these are likely to be retained.The need to replace casualties and to make up reduced intake during the war as well as to meet the.expected increase in demand will provide openings for aconsiderable number of persons who had not started training before their war service. -6. Before the war the capacity of the profession for training pupils wasnot fully taken up and it is estimated that there will be sufficient training capacity for an increased entry in the early post-war years.Actuaries.7. Most actuarial students enter an insurance company at the age of 17or 18 after .a secondary school education. In addition, a small number arerecruited from university graduates with an Honours Degree in Mathematics.Training is obtained after entry by part-time study for the examinations ofthe Institute of Actuaries or the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland.8. The total number of Fellows of the Institute of Actuaries and Facultyof Actuaries in.Scotland in 1939 was 674. In the five years before the war theaverage annual number of persons enrolled as students of the two institutionswas 200 and the corresponding number of persons obtaining a Fellowship was 25.Examinations of both bodies have been suspended since 1942 but will probably be resumed in 1945.  &apos;9. The number of actuaries required after the war will probably be aboutthe same as before the war. There may be some expansion, if openings for youngactuaries are afforded in industry, commerce and the various Government Depart-ments, where there has been a demand for men trained in&apos; statistics duringthe war.10. The need to replace casualties and to make up the reduced intakeduring the war will provide openings for a limited number of persons withmathematical qualifications or aptitude who had not already entered the profes-sion before their war service.11. Arrangements are being made by the profession for actuarial students who have been engaged in war service to be given leave of absence to study duringoffice hours. ..    . Architecture.12. Before the war there were some 11,500 qualified and practising architectural-tects and it is estimated that there was a degree of under-employment amountingto 15 per cent, of this number. It may be assumed that architects will be engaged on the same proportion of building work as before the war, and that there willbe the same ratio of employed architects to employed craftsmen. On these assumptions it is estimated that,&apos;when in due course the building industry reachesits maximum strength, the number of employed architects required will beabout 12,000.  -13. Allowing for civilian and war wastage and for the diversion of anumber of architects to town planning, some 2,000 additional qualified architects
would be needed during the first five years after the war, in order to providethe total of 12,000. The R.I.B.A. have, however, expressed the opinion that, whilethe estimate of 12,000 is based on 100 per cent, employment of architects, someunemployed time will be inevitable, and a 10 per cent, increase on this total shouldbe allowed for.14. During the war the number of persons qualifying as architects hasbeen greatly reduced, but the number of students entering on architecturaltraining each year, was increasing before the war and has continued to&apos; increase during the war. There are some 3,000 architectural students, either from theFinal Architectural Schools, or in the course of part-time study for the R.I.B.A.Final Examinations, whose studies have been interrupted by war service.15. The Committee consider that, if a substantial number of those who havealready begun their architectural, training complete their qualifications at theend of hostilities, and normal training is resumed, there will be a sufficient numberof qualified architects at the peak of the building programme. There may, how-ever, be a temporary shortage of architects in the immediate post-war period,owing to the interval between the resumption of training and the supply of quali-fied persons. The opportunities for persons starting training after their .war service will be limited.Banking and Insurance.16. Apart from actuaries employed in Life Offices (see under Actuaries)few university graduates are recruited by banks or insurance companies, and itis unlikely that the proportion of graduates will increase to any appreciable extent after the war. Staffs are normally recruited at the age of 16 to 18 fromboys and girls with a secondary school education. Professional training is obtained after entry by part-time study for the examinations of the institute of Bankers or the Chartered Insurance Institute. Recruitment, from the schoolshas continued during the war.17. It is estimated that after absorbing the large number of staff now inthe Services, and a proportion of temporary staff recruited during the war, therequirements, of the banking and insurance companies will be almost entirelymet by the normal pre-war intake from the Universities and schools.18. The banking and insurance companies are making arrangements for enabling members of the staffs who have been on war service to be given leave of absence to study during office hours.Catering, Institutional Management and Dietetics.Hotel and Restaurant Industry.19. There is no recognised standard of education or professional qualifi-cations for managerial and executive posts; the general level of education is nothigher than secondary school standard, and the managerial grades are recruited from employees who normally enter between the ages of 16 and 20 and spendsome time gaining practical experience of each branch of the work.20. * Apart from a small number of executive posts in&quot; firms with branchesthroughout the country, for which a university degree is a useful qualification,there is not likely to be much scope for ex-Service men and women, unless theyare young enough to enter the work as beginners and are prepared to undertake the drab routine work necessary to gain practical experience.21. There is a movement in the hotel and restaurant industry to make provision for training which will attract a better type of person than in the past,but this would not involve any general raising of the educational standard ofnew entrants above that of the secondary school.Industrial Catering.22. In view of the rapid expansion of industrial catering during the war,when the recruitment-position has been abnormal, it is difficult to draw any usefulconclusions from the present methods of staffing the managerial and executivegrades. Some firms make their own arrangements for training staff, but othersrecruit women who have taken either a general domestic training or one of the specialised courses in industrial catering which have been set up during the war.&quot; [29154] c 2     ...
23. It is estimated that before the war there were about 2,000 industrialcanteens and that there are now about 20,000. After the war there may be somecontraction of industrial catering, and it is probable that a number of formeremployees will return from the Services. On the other hand, many of those now engaged in the work may return to other forms of catering. Ex-Service men andwomen who have little or no experience are unlikely to find openings in themanagerial and executive grades merely by taking a short course of training;they must be prepared to obtain practical experience first. There may, however,be limited openings for women with a domestic science qualification.24. The foregoing statement of prospects in the hotel and catering industryis based on the present policy and organisation of the industry. The CateringWages Commission have pointed out to the Committee that in their view thepresent position leaves room for improvement, and they are considering how thegeneral approach to recruitment problems can be brought into line with moderneducational tendencies. Any recommendations on this subject can, however, onlyaffect prospects on a long-term. view.Institutional Management.25. Institutional Management is usually undertaken by women. Boardingschools, colleges, hostels and similar institutions are to an increasing extentrecruiting housekeeping and catering staff from women who have taken a domestic science course in Institutional Management and have then gained thenecessary practical experience, beginning in a cooking post.26. Before the war approximately 250 trained women were employed asorganisers or supervisors in the School Meals Service in England and Wales, buta proportion of these were giving part-time service only. There is no record ofthe number employed in Scotland. The number of trained women now employedin England, Wales and Scotland is about 500.27. On the assumption that the rate of expansion of the School MealsService is as satisfactory as expected, it is estimated that between 3,000 and 3,500trained women will be required within five years after the end of hostilities withGermany.28. The normal course of training lasts two years, but women who havebeen employed as catering officers or who have been in charge of a mess may beable to take special shortened courses. There are likely to be numerous openingsin the School Meals Service and, to a lesser extent, in other forms of institutionalmanagement.Dietetics.29. The total membership of the British Dietetic Association in 1939 was187. The average annual intake for England and Wales in the years 1937 to1939 inclusive was 37 and in the years. 1940 to 1943 inclusive was 34. Fewpersons have been interrupted in their course of training, but approximately 25have been unable to start.30. Before the war there was a shortage of dietitians, which has now become acute. The Ministry of Health estimate that a total of 600 dietitians willbe required for the hospital service in England and Wales after the-war andthat this figure might be reached with an annual intake of 100. The Departmentof Health for Scotland consider that the present annual output from the Scottishtraining schools of about 30 a year should be maintained and, if possible,increased. Admission to training is confined to persons who have a specifieduniversity degree or qualification in domestic science or are State-registerednurses, and the difficulty will probably be to find persons with these qualifications.The profession has so far been recruited from women, but men are not debarred from entering it.31. The British Dietetic Association consider that the existing training facilities would not be adequate to accommodate the total required intake of130 students a year. The Association are discussing the establishment of a degree course in Dietetics with the University of London authorities.Churches.32. Theological students have been reserved during the war to complete their training, provided that they were regarded, before September 1939, by anyrecognised religious denomination as a candidate for Holy Orders or for appoint-ment as a regular minister of that denomination.   There has, however, been a
considerable. drop in recruitment during the war. The Committee recommendthat encouragement should be given to persons who desire, and are accepted for,training by any recognised religious denomination.Civil Service.33. This Section comprises the Foreign Service, the Home Civil Service, theIndian Services, Burma Services and the Colonial Service.34. The probable requirements for persons with specific professional andtechnical qualifications for these services have been taken into account in theconclusions under the heading of the particular qualification concerned. such requirements are likely to be substantial, particularly in the case of the home civil Service and Colonial Service.35. Normal recruitment to the permanent staff of the administrative andcomparable grades of most of these Services has been suspended during the warand, to make up leeway in recruitment, requirements during the early post-war years will be abnormally high. Immediately after the cessation of hostilities with Germany it is proposed to recruit to permanent posts from those who have lost their normal opportunities of competing on account of the war, by means olspecial reconstruction competitions, with or without written examination. Thosewho have been filling vacant posts temporarily during war time will also. beconsidered, though preference will not be granted to them on account of their war-time experience. Normal peace-time recruitment from Universities andother sources will be resumed as soon as possible, including, at the start, recruit-ment from those who take short courses for ex-members of the Forces. women are not eligible for the posts concerned in the Foreign Service, Indian or BurmaServices, or, with the exception of a limited range of posts, in the colonial service.Foreign Service. It is estimated that in future the normal annual recruit-ment for the branch of the Foreign Office equivalent to the Home Civil service will be about 25 to 30.Home Civil Service.&apos; The post-war size of the permanent Home CivilService will probably be about 20 to 30 per cent, above the pre-war establishment.The normal annual intake to the administrative class and to the Inland RevenueTax Inspectorate and the Ministry of Labour departmental class will be about50 for each class.Indian Services and Burma Services: It is possible that in due courseconstitutional changes may affect the recruitment of candidates outside Indiaand Burma for these Services.Colonial Service. The normal annual recruitment to the Colonial service will probably be substantially higher than before the war, but this increase may be offset in the course of time by an increase in the proportion of staffrecruited locally in the Colonies.Commercial Art and Industrial Design.36. Before the war, design for-pictorial and press publicity offered betterprospects than design for manufacture. A fair number of art students securedposts in studies or in advertising agencies or were able to obtain free-lance work.37. After the war there will probably be openings in pictorial and presspublicity on the same scale as before the war. The Incorporated Society ofPractitioners in Advertising estimate that about 40 artists will be requiredfor advertising agencies. There may also be openings in design for exhibitionand shop display.38. Industries such as pottery, textiles, glass, silver, furniture and wall-paper recruited few staff designers from senior students in Art Schools.&apos; A fewindustries such as the Leicester hosiery industry entered into an arrangement with the local art school whereby the school provided the industry with recruits,but such arrangements were rare and industries more often recruited to theirdesign studies boys and girls of 15 from junior Art Departments. A small number of consultants obtained work in Resigning mass-produced goods, suchas kitchen equipment.39. There is evidence that manufacturers are now using the services ofdesigners to an increasing extent.   A new body to further the improvement in
the design of everyday things is to be set up by the Government; it will have greater scope and powers than were possessed by the Council for Art andIndustry, and one of its, main functions will be to assist industries to establishtheir own industrial design centres. More industrial designers are, therefore,likely to be needed in the future. Even so the number of openings will not be large and only those persons with outstanding ability and a flair for the work should be encouraged to train for such a career.Dentistry.40. The number of practising dentists at the present time in England andWales is about 12,000 to .13,000, an unduly large number being in the higher age groups. Despite the full reservation of dental students during the war, entry tothe profession has dropped from about 340 annually before the war to below300 during the war.   In Scotland the present output is about 120.41. The Inter-departmental Committee on Dentistry (Chairman LordTeviot) have submitted an Interim Report in which they recommend that a comprehensive dental service should be organised as an integral part of thenational health service from its inception, and that special measures shouldbe taken by the Local Authorities to develop their services for expectant and nursing mothers, children and adolescents. The implementation of these recommendations would clearly accentuate the need for dentists; the TeviotCommittee&apos;s final report will embody their views on recruitment.42. In view of the age distribution, the drop in entry during recent years,and the proposals of the Teviot Committee, it is clear that there is a pressingneed to attract suitable recruits to the profession after the war.Economics.43. Economists do not form a profession in the ordinary sense of the word,though the function of the expert economist outside the university world is increasingly recognised. The minimum qualification necessary for an experteconomist is either first- or good second-class honours in a university &apos; degreein which economics is the main subject, or a post-graduate qualification in somebranch of economic study.44. It is estimated that the average number of persons who achieved suchqualifications in economics in the four years 1936-39 was between 100 and 175a year. This figure is based on incomplete information and includes a numberof foreigners who returned to their own countries after completing training.The proportion of this number who became professional economists is not known.45. Apart from the expert economist, many persons take university courses in economics or which include economic subjects, as a preparation for an administrative or business career.46. The demand for economic experts has been increasing for many years.This tendency has been accelerated during the war and there is now a serious shortage. It may be expected that more economists will be required afterthe war for employment in Government service at home and overseas, industry,commerce and finance, and financial journalism, and for teaching and research at universities and research institutions.47. There will be good openings for persons who have been engaged in war service and have the requisite qualifications and ability.Fighting Services.48. Each Service has issued or will issue announcements to its membersabout the conditions under which temporary members of the Service will be eligible for consideration for permanent commissions.49. It is impracticable at the present time to forecast the conditions underwhich the normal pre-war entry of university graduates to the Services may be resumed. The probable requirements of the Fighting Services. after the war for persons with specific professional and technical qualifications have, however,been taken into account in the conclusions under the heading of the particularqualification concerned.
&apos; Housing Management.50. At the present time there are two main training bodies in the field :the Society of Women Housing Managers and the Institute of Housing. TheSociety is an established body which runs its system of training and qualifyingexaminations under the aegis of the Chartered Surveyors&apos; Institution. Member-ship of the Society is confined to women. The Institute of Housing was foundedin 1931 and until March 1944 membership is understood to have been open toany man or woman engaged in housing work who paid the annual subscription.The only training which can be regarded, as within the Committee&apos;s scope isthat provided by the Society of Women Housing Managers.51. The number of fully-qualified members of the Society in June 1944was 250, of whom 130 were employed by municipal housing authorities. Theannual intake before the war was approximately 30 and this rate has been maintained during the war.52. A large number of extra managers are likely to be required soon afterthe war. It is expected that the number of municipally-owned houses will bemore than doubled in the next decade and that all these houses will need tobe managed. The problem, moreover, is not only one of a numerical increase.There is need for a higher standard of management which the Ministry ofHealth is anxious to promote.53. In England and Wales municipal estates may be expected to absorb atan early date at least 100 more managers trained on the lines of the Society ofWomen Housing Managers. vIn Scotland, it is thought that not more than 10additional managers trained on the Society&apos;s methods would be required for thefirst three years after the war.54. The Society of Women Housing Managers estimate that they couldtrain&quot; up to 60 students a year.Journalism..55. It is estimated that the total number of journalists in the UnitedKingdom before the war was under 10,000, of whom not more than 1,500 were employed on London national papers.56. Entrants to the profession normally go into provincial newspaper officesat the age of 16 to 18 after a secondary school education and learn throughpractical experience of the day-to-day work. A small number enter at a later ageafter taking a university degree or a diploma in journalism.57. The profession is highly competitive and only those who can prove theiraptitude and flair are likely to be successful in making a career in journalism.After the war the newspaper press will only gradually return to its pre-war level as sufficient supplies of paper are made available. Openings in the.years immedi-ately after the war are also likely to be limited by the obligation to reinstate thejournalists now on war service, and by the retention of some of the temporary staff who have been engaged as replacements during the war. There are, therefore,likely to be few openings for men and women who have been on war service andhave no previous journalistic experience. The Journalists&apos; Advisory Committeeto the Appointments Department of the Ministry of Labour and National Servicesuggest that applicants for assistance for training in journalism after their war service should first be interviewed by persons with experience in the profession.Law.Barristers:58. The number of barristers in England and Wales who were actively engaged in professional practice before the war was about 700. The Bar quali-fication leads to a number of other openings besides practice at the Bar, and thenumber of calls to the Bar averaged about 300 each year; the majority of thosecalled were university graduates. The number of students intending to practise,whose training has been interrupted by war service, is about 400; it is probablethat fewer than 250 of these would have succeeded in establishing a practice atthe Bar. In Scotland, the total number of practising advocates before the war was about 80.59. The. total number of persons with Bar qualifications required after thewar is not likely to be more than before the war : an increase in some branches of
practice will probably be offset by a decline in others. The need for replacingcasualties and for making up leeway in training during the war will provideopportunities for a limited number to start training after their war service.Solicitors.60. In 1939 there was a total of 17,100 solicitors holding practisingcertificates in England and Wales and 3,000 in Scotland. In addition there were about 3,000 to 4,000 solicitors not holding practising certificates, but engaged inlegal work in England and Wales and about 2,500 in Scotland.61. In England and Wales the average number of persons who qualified assolicitors annually in the years 1935 to 1939 inclusive was 740, and in the years1940 to 1943 inclusive was 190. In Scotland the corresponding number for thepre-war years was 120.62. The number of articled clerks whose training has been interrupted by war service is between 3,500 and 4,000 in England and Wales and about 1,000 inScotland.63. The total number of solicitors required after the war is expected to beabout the same as before the war. The Law Society, however, consider that before the war intake into the profession was exceeding the normal annualwastage and was leading to overcrowding, and that once the war-time deficiency in recruitment has been made good, the annual intake into the profession inEngland and Wales should not average more than 500 over any period of tenyears.64. Openings for persons who start training after their war service will beavailable to the extent necessary to make good casualties and the war-timedeficiency in recruitment. Such openings may be of the order of 1,000 for england, Wales and Scotland.65. Owing to the dispersal of law teachers during the war and the need toprovide for the training of those who have been on war service as well as thenormal flow of students, training capacity in both branches of the legal professionwill be limited in the immediate post-war period.Librarian ship.66. Staffs of public libraries are mainly recruited from boys and girlsleaving secondary schools, but the proportion of university graduates is growing.67. In 1939 the total number of Associates and Fellows of the LibraryAssociation was 2,014. The number of persons elected as Associates or Fellowsincreased from 208 in 1935 to 384 in 1939. During the war the recruitment ofmen has been interrupted, but the recruitment of women has continued. Thenumber of persons whose training has been interrupted is approximately 2,000.68. The.public library service was expanding before the war, and duringthe war issues of books have increased considerably. After the war the totalnumber of persons required will probably not be less and may be more than beforethe war. The Library Association consider that the proportion of men to women should not be allowed to fall below the pre-war level of 50 per cent.69. In view of the continued recruitment of women during the war,openings for persons who have had no previous training before their war service will be few and will be mainly restricted to men.Local Government Service.70. The requirements of Local Authorities for persons with higherqualifications are mainly for those with specific professional and technical qualifications legal, accounting, architectural, engineering, &amp;c. These require-ments which are expected to be greater than before the war have been taken intoaccount in the conclusions under the heading of the particular qualification- concerned. In view of casualties, and the drop in recruitment during the war,there should be openings to the number of several thousand for those coming from war service.
Management (Industry and Commerce).71. This section covers the various branches of management, includinggeneral administration, production, personnel and sales.72. The prospects in industry and commerce, including prospects on themanagerial side, for persons with specific professional or technical qualifications,are taken into account under the heading of the qualification concerned (seeAccountancy, Economics, Pure, and Applied Science, Secretaries, &amp;c).73. Except for the more technical functions of management, the majorityof posts are usually filled by the promotion of persons who have entered firmsdirect from school and have acquired practical experience. There is, however,an increasing tendency among the larger firms in certain branches of industryand commerce to recruit persons with higher qualifications, e.g., a universitydegree. There is also a growing body of opinion that the principles and technique of management can profitably be included in a syllabus of training. At oneUniversity - a post-graduate Department of Business Administration already exists, and at others, courses in various aspects of industrial administration are provided. In addition, a number of Technical Colleges make some provision forteaching this subject.74. Except in the case of personnel management, which is dealt with below,the Committee have not obtained detailed evidence on the prospects in the various branches of management. It is, however, expected that the trend which was apparent before the war towards the recruitment of persons with higher qualifica-tions will continue after the war and should provide increasing opportunities for persons with such qualifications. The Ministry of Labour are engaged in dis-cussions with industry and commerce on the possibility of providing facilities for persons coming from war service to train for managerialposts.Personnel Management.75. The normal training before the war consisted of a university course in social Science combined with at least two months&apos; practical experience.76. The pre-war annual intake to training courses recognised by the institute of Labour Management was 40 and this has doubled during the war.A few women entered the profession after taking a general Social Science course and a certain number of men entered without specific training. During the warthe Ministry of Labour and National Service established a three months&apos;emergency training course for men and women over the age of 25 in order tomeet the greatly increased demands for trained personnel officers; this course isnow suspended. At present nearly 6,000 men and women are engaged in personnel management, but many of these are untrained.77. It is estimated that a total force of 5,000 to 7,000 personnel officers islikely to be required after the war. In the immediate post-war period some ofthose who have entered this calling during the war will, no doubt, return to their pre-war occupation, but this loss will be to some extent offset by the release of experienced persons from ordnance and other factories.78. There will be openings for a limited number of persons who have been on war service, especially for those who have acquired useful experience in personnel administration. As the majority of those trained and recruited duringthe war have been women, opportunities for those coming from war service willbe greater for men than for women. The establishment of a special One-yearcourse for those who already have suitable experience is now being considered.The annual output required under normal conditions in the future will probablybe of the order of 150 to 200, of whom a good proportion should be men.Medical Auxiliary Services.. Chiropody.79. It is estimated that immediately before the war the total number ofpractising chiropodists was 3,500, of whom 95 per cent, were engaged in private practice. The average annual intake in the five years before the war was 350 and during the war has been 70. The number of persons whose training has been interrupted by war service is approximately 40.f29154] * &apos; D
80. Some increase in the total number of chiropodists will be required afterthe war, and it is estimated that for the first two years after the end of hostilities with Germany and Japan recruitment should average 600 a year. Of these 530will probably be required for private practice and the remainder for appomt-ments with Government Departments, municipal clinics and factories.81 The capacity of the recognised training schools is approximately 500 inany one year; it would be difficult to increase the intake without increasing the accommodation of the schools.Occupational Therapy.   &apos; -- 82. In 1938 the Association of Occupational Therapists had a membership of 48; in June 1944 the membership was 125.83. The new emphasis on rehabilitation will make occupational therapy arapidly expanding service after the war. Any estimate of future total require-ments is speculative, but might be put at 450 for England and Wales. An intake of about 100 a year in the early post-war years will probably be required for thecountry as a whole.84. Two additional training schools are to be opened, and with these theexisting training facilities will be adequate to accommodate 100 students a year.Optical Work.85. The figures set out below refer to sight-testing opticians recognised bythe Ophthalmic Benefit Society and to dispensing opticians.86. In 1939 the total number of opticians engaged in practice was 8,100.The average annual intake in the years 1935 to 1938 inclusive was 330, and inthe years 1939 to 1943 inclusive was 130. The approximate number of persons whose training as opticians has been interrupted is 1,000.87. &quot; The question how far opticians are likely to- be used in public servicedepends on the ophthalmic policy of the National Health Service. This has notyet been explored, and for the time being it can only be assumed that the totalnumber of opticians required will continue to be much the same as before the war.88. It is estimated that in view of casualties and deficiency in recruitmentduring the war an annual intake of 370 will be required in the first two yearsafter the end of the war and an annual intake of 310 in the subsequent five years.The demand for the first two years after the war is more likely to be met by persons whose training as opticians has been interrupted than by new entrants.89. The present course of training is undergoing considerable revision andmay be lengthened. Until this question has been determined it is not possible tosay whether existing training facilities will be adequate after the war.Orthoptics.90. In 1939 the total number of practising orthoptists was 119. The average annual recruitment in the years 1936-39 inclusive was 20 and in the years1940^i3 inclusive was 14.91. Few orthoptists are at present employed in hospitals, but before thewar there was a tendency to recruit more and this is likely to continue. Theannual intake will probably be about 25, with perhaps a steady increase of 2 or 3a year.Physiotherapy.92. The total membership of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists in1939 was 11,650, of whom.about 50 per cent, were actively engaged. The average number of persons admitted to membership in the years 1935 to 1939 inclusivewas 460, and in the years 1940 to 1943 inclusive was 470. The number of persons whose training has been interrupted by war service is small.93. With the development of rehabilitation and rheumatism treatment thereis an increasing demand for physiotherapists and there is already a. shortage.Apart from the hospitals a comprehensive health service may well make necessaryan increase in physiotherapists for clinical and, possibly, domiciliary treatment.The latter service would dispense with private practice to some extent but, ifprovided free, would lead to an increase in the total amount of work.
94. For the needs of the hospital service alone, it is estimated that the intake of physiotherapists should be increased by 250 a year in the early post-war years.  The total annual intake should be about 750.95. The Chartered Society of Physiotherapists hope to set up two newtraining schools in the near future. With these, and with some expansion ofexisting schools, the training facilities should be adequate to accommodate 750students a year.Radiography. .96. The approximate number of radiographers in 1939 was 1,000. Theaverage annual intake before the war was 100 and is now about 150. The society of Radiographers have no record of any person whose training has been interrupted by war service.97. It is estimated that the beds required for a fully developed hospital service will need a total of 4,500 radiographers in England and Wales. In viewof the present shortage of radiographers, and of the expected increase inradiological work, an annual intake of .300 starting immediately after the war islikely to be required. The annual intake in Scotland should probably be 15 to 20for two years after the war.Speech Therapy.98. The approximate number of speech therapists before the war was 200.The annual recruitment in the five years before the war was 30 to 40. During thefirst three years of the war the annual intake dropped to 15 or 20, but it is nowback to the pre-war level and is increasing. There has been little or nointerruption of training due to war service.99. On the assumption that there should be one speech therapist for a school population of 10,000, it is estimated that about 550 full-time speech therapistswill be required for schools after the war. In addition, about 100 speechtherapists will be required for hospital work. The annual intake necessary tomeet these requirements is 80--90.100. There are at present five training schools, but more will have to be opened in order to meet the expected increase in demand.Medicine.Medical Practice.101. It is estimated that before the war the number of practising doctorswas : England and Wales ...      .........      35,000Scotland       ...      ...      ..........        4,700102. It is difficult at this stage to arrive at any reliable forecast of future requirements but, on a very rough estimate, an increase within ten years of theorder of 5,000 doctors in England and Wales and 500 in Scotland would seem tobe desirable, if it could be achieved.103. The pre-war output of approximately 2,000 from the Medical Schoolshas been maintained during the war, but training has been intensified and thegreat majority of those trained during the war have entered the Forces withoutthe customary or desirable post-graduate training. Men who have entered theForces include (a) about 600 practitioners who have qualified through the Royal College, but may on demobilisation wish to sit for university courses;(&amp;) about 1,800 to 2,000 practitioners who need hospital appointments.before proceeding to general practice;(c) about 1,750 practitioners who wish to take specialist degrees or diplomas;(a) about 550 to 750 practitioners aiming at careers as consultants who need further specialist training.104. In addition there are in the Forces a number of men who were about to embark on medical training before they entered the Forces or are now-considering training for the medical profession.105.   There is no reason to expect a deficiency in the number of suitableapplicants for entry to the Medical Schools after the war, but the Ministry of[29154] D 2
Health point out and the recent Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on medical Schools has emphasised -that the possibility of expanding the size ofthe medical profession after the war will be limited by the training facilities,particularly for clinical training, which is available only in the teaching hospitalswhere a sufficient variety of clinical cases is assembled.Medical Research.106. The Medical Research Council point out that both in the case ofmedically qualified investigators and in the case of those with scientificqualifications only, the limiting factor is likely to be the rarity of the specialability for success in original research work.Modern Languages.107. A university degree course in modern languages is to be regardedprimarily as a general Arts course rather than as a specific preparation for particular careers, except in the case of modern language teachers. The EducationDepartments estimate that apart from the normal pre-war demand, and thewar-time arrears of recruitment, approximately 1,000 additional languageteachers will be required for the schools after the war.108. A knowledge of modern languages is a valuable additionalqualification in a wide range of other careers and in some cases it is an indispensable subsidiary qualification. For the Foreign Service a knowledge oflanguages is required; for the Colonial Service and service with the british council, a knowledge or aptitude for modern languages may be desirable. Forcommerce and overseas trade, linguistic training normally follows engagement bya firm rather than the reverse. The evidence received by the Committee indicates that after the war there is likely to be a considerably increased need for industrial and commercial managers and representatives, both in this country and overseas,to be equipped with a knowledge of modern languages.109. This need will, it is hoped, be met by arrangements under the further education and Training Scheme or otherwise, by which firms would releasemembers of their staff to take intensive courses, either whole or part time, inthe language and culture of the country to which they will be sent. The Com-mittee do not consider that encouragement should generally be given to takemodern language courses with a view to qualifying specially for appointment toan industrial or commercial firm. It is, however, desirable that a greater proportion of persons taking university degree courses, both technical and non-technical, should be encouraged to take a modern language or languages as a subsidiary qualification.110. Teaching of foreign languages at Universities and Technical Collegeshas hitherto been mainly confined to West. European and Russian languages. Itis expected that after the war there will be an increased need for training inthe Scandinavian languages, Dutch and Portuguese, in the Slavonic and EastEuropean languages, and in the Oriental and African languages. Some expansionof teaching staff will be involved.111. At the instance of the Foreign Office an interdepartmental commission is being set up to consider the facilities in Great Britain for the study of Oriental,Slavonic and East European languages. A similar enquiry is being undertaken by the Colonial Office in the field of the languages of the Colonies.112. The Committee consider that there should be provision for grants forex-Servicemen and women to study languages abroad, as well as in this country.Music, Fine Arts and Dramatic Art.113. The Committee recommend that only persons with exceptional-talentshould be encouraged to undertake training in these subjects as a preparation for a career.Nursing and Midwifery.114. The estimates of post-war requirements for nursing and midwiferygiven below relate mainly to the two years after the cessation of hostilities inEurope. There is no doubt that there will be greatly increased demands fornurses after that time, but it is too early yet to make any estimates of these demands.
Nurses.115. The total number of nurses on the State Registers of the GeneralNursing Councils of England and Wales and of Scotland on the 31st October, 1943,was 121,863, of whom a proportion were not engaged in the profession.116. The average annual intake of student nurses in the years 1935 to 1939inclusive was approximately 14,670, and in the years 1940 to 1942 inclusivewas approximately 20,130. These figures are based on the number of candidateswho entered for the Preliminary State Examination, but as some may have enteredmore than once, the figures may be swollen on that account. The average numberof persons who qualified as State Registered Nurses in the years 1936 to 1939inclusive Was 7,650 and in the years 1940 to 1942 inclusive was 7,600.&apos;117. As can be seen from these figures, there is at present considerablewastage during training. Efforts are being made to reduce the wastage by improving methods of selection and training. Even if Wastage is reduced toa minimum, there will be an almost limitless demand for State Registered Nursesfor the Health Services for many years. In addition, a considerable number ofState Registered Nurses will be needed for appointments overseas, particularlyin the Colonies, and about 5,000 will be needed for schools in England and Wales.118. In England and Wales there are a sufficient number of training placesimmediately available for suitable candidates. In Scotland, however, there are few unfilled training places and the Department of Health for Scotland areactively engaged in a campaign to secure increased facilities for training.Industrial Nurses.119. Approximately 8,400 nurses are employed in factories, about half ofwhom are State Registered Nurses.120. It is estimated that 10,000 nurses will be needed for industryimmediately after the war and that a further 5,000 will be required as soon as more nurses become available. About half the 10,000 will be State RegisteredNurses and the proportion of these will increase as the total rises to 15,000.Sister Tutors.121. In 1943, a total of 834 Sister Tutors were in employment, but someof these were unqualified.122. There will be a grave shortage of qualified sister tutors at the endof the war. About 900 qualified sister tutors will be required for the trainingof State Registered Nurses and others will be required for the training of assistantnurses and for posts overseas.Male Nurses.123. The number of male nurses is small in relation to the number of femalenurses, except in the mental hospital service.124. It is unlikely that there will be as wide a scope for male nurses in generalnursing as for female nurses, but there will be a considerable demand for qualifiedmale nurses in mental nursing. There is an immediate shortage of 700 malenurses in general nursing and 1,700 in mental nursing, but not all these vacanciesare for State Registered Nurses.Midwives.125. There are 84,697 women on the Midwives Rolls maintained by theCentral Midwives Boards for England and Wales and for Scotland, but of theseonly 17,314 notified their- intention to practise during 1943. The considerabledifference between the total number of midwives on the Rolls and the numberwho notified their intention to practise during 1943 is due to the fact that alarge number of midwives who are also State Registered Nurses adopt generalnursing and not midwifery as their career. Further, a large number of midwiveswho have retired continue to retain their names on the Roll.126. The average number of persons added to the Midwives Rolls for theyears 1936 to 1939 inclusive was 3,900 and in the years 1940 to 1943 inclusivewas 1,650. The reduction during the war was the result of new training andexamination rules and since 1941 the intake has.been increasing. The presentshortage of practising midwives is not so much the result of the decrease in
the number who qualified as midwives as in the number who practised afterqualification. It is hoped that the introduction of the Rushcliffe and laylorscales of salary will ensure that more women who qualify as midwives will adoptmidwifery as their career.Midwife Teachers.127 There are about 225 approved training institutions in the countryand each of these should have a qualified midwife teacher. . Allowing for wastage,this means that the number of midwife teachers required immediately after thewar is about 112.District Nurses and District Nurse-Midwives.128. A total of 8,000 district nurses, district nurse-midwives and villagenurse-midwives were employed in England and Wales in 1944. There is atpresent a shortage of about 1,500 and it is thought that additional post-war requirements may increase this figure.Health Visitors.129. In 1943 there were 5,786 health visitors in employment in England andWales, and in 1944 there were about 700 in employment in Scotland. The figures include a number of district nurses who spend a proportion of their time on health visiting. The number of persons qualifying as health visitors annuallyin the years 1941 to 1944 inclusive was 338. It is expected that the present annualintake will not be sufficient to meet post-war requirements.130. In England and Wales the existing training facilities could beextended if required, but in Scotland additional training centres will have tobe opened.Pharmacy.131. &quot;In 1939 the total number of pharmacists was approximately 24,200.The average number of persons who qualified as pharmacists in the years 1935to 1939 inclusive was 900 and in the years 1940 to 1943 inclusive was 580.132. The number of persons whose training has been interrupted by war service is approximately 1,000. In addition, a number of those who had qualifiedas chemists and druggists will desire to proceed to the higher qualification ofpharmaceutical chemist.133. It is not yet known what effect the development of the National health service will have on the demand for phamacists. So far as can be foreseenthe total number of pharmacists required after the war will not be larger than before the war and it is estimated that when the persons whose training has been interrupted have been absorbed the average recruitment should not be more than500 a year.134. Any deficiency caused by the war will be met if the majority of those whose training has been interrupted return to the profession. There will befew openings for those who had not started training before their war service.135. Training facilities will be sufficient to accommodate both personsentering on training from the schools and those whose training has been interrupted by war service provided that accommodation and teaching staff arerestored.Psychology.136. The requirements for medical psychologists are dealt with under the heading of Medicine.137. Although there is no formal scheme for the registration ofpsychologists, most professional psychologists are members of the BritishPsychological Society. Earlier in the war there were 136 non-medical Fellowsand Associates of the Society, of whom 38 were engaged in educational psychology,26 in industrial psychology, and 72 were holding teaching appointments. Someof these are now employed on personnel selection work in the Services.138.   The average number of persons who took an honours degree in&apos; psychology before the war was about 50 to 60, of whom only a proportion becameprofessional psychologists.
139. A considerable increase in the total number of professionalpsychologists is likely to be required after the war. It is expected that a totalof some 500 to GOO psychologists will be needed for educational work. In addition is estimated that about 50 will be required for industrial psychology in thethree years following the end of the war, and a further small number for teachingappointments at Universities, teachers&apos; training Colleges and centres of adulteducation. The annual intake to the profession in the years immediately following the war should be approximately 70.140. There will be good opportunities for men and women who have hadexperience of personnel selection work in the Services, and complete theirprofessional training after the war.Pure and Applied Science (including Engineering).141. The minimum standard of training with which the Committee areconcerned is a university degree, a Higher National Certificate, or membershipby examination of a recognised &quot;professional institution. There is no completeprofessional registration of qualified scientists and engineers, but the numbersat present enrolled on the Central (Technical and Scientific) Register of theMinistry of Labour, which include a number who have taken only shortenedcourses during the war, give an indication of the distribution between the differentbranches.AgricultureBiologyChemistryGeologyMathematicsMetallurgyPhysicsCivil Engineering ...Electrical EngineeringMechanical Engineering2,34019,9806502,4301,1103,52016,37036,17060,910142. During the war output has been increased in certain branches andrestricted in others, in accordance with war needs. The number from universities and Technical Colleges and the examinations of professional institutions on average in the years 1934-39 and the number for 1943, were as follows : Science.	Agri-culture.	Biological Sciences.	Chemistry.	Geology.	Mathe-matics.	Metal-lurgy.	Physics.

143. Besides these normal sources of supply in the period 1944-46 rather more than 3,000 Engineering Cadets are expected to qualify, and the Services havealso trained some hundreds of men to an equivalent standard in engineering.144. The evidence received by the Committee has been unanimous in fore-casting, that after the war there will, in most branches of pure and appliedscience, be a substantially greater demand than before the war. The Departmentsconcerned consider that there should be a 50 per cent, increase in the supply ofpersons qualified to undertake research. A substantial increase in requirementsmay be also expected for teaching, and in the Government service at home and overseas for functions other than research.145. The requirements for the development, production, management andselling sides of industry and commerce are subject to uncertain factors such asthe prevailing state of trade,&apos; and the attitude of employers to the recruitment of persons with higher qualifications. The evidence from employers as well asfrom the Government Departments and professional bodies concerned agree,however, in forecasting a substantially increased demand for these purposes,especially in view of the needs of the export trade.146. On this evidence there can be no doubt that, if a high and stable levelof employment is achieved after the war, requirements for persons qualified inpure and applied science will be much greater than before the war. It is equallyclear that an increased supply and absorption by industry of such persons willbe an important factor in realising a high and stable level of employment. TheCommittee have kept both these considerations in mind in reaching conclusionsabout prospects in the particular branches of pure and applied science.   \147. The Committee consider that most of those who have taken scientificor engineering courses during the war will be needed after the war for work,including Reaching, which will make use of their qualifications. During theperiod of conversion from war to peace production, -there may, however, be some dislocation of employment in the manufacturing industries and a period during which manufacturers, uncertain about their raw material supplies, abouttrading conditions generally and about their obligations to their previousemployees, may be unwilling to go much beyond their statutory obligationsregarding reinstatement. Much of this uncertainty should, however, have dissapeared before most of those who have taken scientific or technical coursesduring the war, and are now in the Forces, are ready to be absorbed into industry.. After release from war service some of them will require further education or training in the form of refresher courses, completion of degree courses, post-graduate training or training in industry. The majority of those who havetaken physics courses during the war, and a proportion of those who have takenbiological, geological or engineering courses have been employed during the war on radio work either in civilian establishments or in the Forces; some of these will need training for other branches of pure and applied science.148. There is likely to be considerable pressure on the training capacityof university scientific and engineering Faculties in the early post-war yearsand the number of those who can be admitted to begin such courses after their war service will necessarily be limited. Owing, however, to the policy duringthe war of deferring students from military service to take scientific orengineering courses, the number of those on war service who have been prevented from taking such training and would be qualified to begin such training afterthe war, is likely to be comparatively small.149. The prospects in the various branches of Pure and Applied Sciencemay be summarised as follows : Biological Sciences (including Agriculture and Forestry).150.   The demand for persons qualified in the biological sciences is expected &apos;to be substantially greater than before the war and will probably require anannual supply of twice the pre-war number.A griculture.151. Before the war the supply of qualified persons for agricultural research and specialised Advisory Services was inadequate both in quality and quantity,and during the war few science graduates have specialised in agricultural
research or advisory work.   There is, therefore, a gap in the recruitment ofpersons of this standard.152. The Departments concerned have furnished estimates of the numberof persons with some scientific training before their war service who could, with further training, be absorbed in such work in the early post-war years. It isestimated that facilities will be available in the first three years after the war for the training of some 50 men per annum and that such a number could readily be absorbed. Candidates must show evidence of adequate knowledge of theappropriate Natural Sciences and they should, where necessary, receive furthertraining by specialising in one particular subject Botany, Zoology or Chemistry to enable them to complete an honours degree course. . In all cases they shouldtake a post-graduate course in. Agriculture and Agricultural Science. A consider -able number of young biologists who have gone into the Forces or some other form of national service would be suitable i f carefully selected and given post-graduate training.153. Wider training facilities will be required immediately after the war,partly at research institutions and partly at graduate schools of agriculture.154. Men with less specialised academic qualifications but with a widerknowledge of agricultural practice are required for an expanded general advisory service at home and for posts as agricultural officers in the Colonies. About60 men per annum who have been engaged in war service could be trained andabsorbed in the first three years after the war. The initial qualifications shouldbe much the same as for the specialist, but men with a degree in agriculture would also be eligible. The essential part of the further training would be a post-graduate course (one or two years according to the candidate&apos;s previoustraining and experience) in the appropriate agricultural subjects. The pool ofmen trained as proposed above would be drawn upon for agricultural teachingposts and some of the men would also be attracted into technical posts in indus-tries connected with agriculture (e.g., fertiliser manufacture).155. In addition about 15 persons a year who are already partially qualifiedcould be trained and absorbed into work concerned with Horticulture and intoeach of the following specialised branches of Agriculture : General AnimalHusbandry, Dairy Husbandry, and Poultry Husbandry. Some 50 agriculturaleconomists will also be required each year, of whom about half might be personsreleased from war service.156. It is impracticable at the present time to forecast the requirements in agricultural work beyond the early post-war years. A Committee under theChairmanship of Dr. Loveday are at present considering the character and extentof the need for higher agricultural education in England and Wales.Forestry.157. The Forestry Commission estimate that if the proposals in the white paper on Post War Forest Policy are implemented, they will need to recruit30-40 Forest Officers annually for the first five years after the war and there-after about half that number annually. The Colonial Office estimate their requirements at 31 as soon as possible after the end of the war. Within thefour following years, a further 68 will be required. Their normal pre-war intakewas 6-10 annually and in future normal wastage and expansion are estimated torequire an annual intake of about 15.158. Recruitment of graduates in Forestry has continued during the war to a limited extent for Government appointments overseas, but training has beencurtailed both in length and in numbers as compared with pre-war conditions.It appears that in the first few years after the war there will be a serious shortageof men with the necessary qualifications. Men in the Forces who have already had some forestry or biological training will have to spend at least two years at a University in order to reach the standard required by the Forest Services.The pre-war annual output from the Universities of approximately 45 willrequire a moderate increase in the future.Chemistry.159.   The demand for qualified chemists for production and managementfunctions as well as for research is likely to continue to expand after the war[29154] s
An annual supply of qualified chemists of 50 per cent, above the pre-war supply is likely to be required.160. These demands should absorb most of those who have been trainedduring the war, and provide some opportunities for those who start trainingafter their war service.Geology.161. It is estimated that within two years of the end of hostilities therewill be vacancies for 125-150 Geologists, particularly for the Colonial and HomeGeological service and for oil geology. The number, of.trained and semi-trainedgeologists who will become available after their war service will not be adequate to meet this demand and some persons who had started training in biologicalscience before their war service should be encouraged to complete their trainingin geology. The normal annual supply of qualified geologists will probablyneed to be about 20 per cent, greater than before the war.Mathematics.162. The number taking courses in pure mathematics before the war waslarge in relation to the numbers in other scientific courses. No special effortsappear to be required to obtain an increase in the annual supply.Metallurgy.163. The Report of the Committee of the Advisory Council of the Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial Research on the Supply and Training ofMetallurgists forecasts a greatly increased demand for qualified metallurgistsafter the war, especially for production and management. In spite of encourage-ment given during the war by the State Bursary Scheme, the pre-war annual output of 40 qualified metallurgists has only been increased slightly during thewar. Men who have been trained during the war in physics, engineering orchemistry&quot; would be suitable with further training.164. The pre-war annual supply should be increased by 100 per cent, buttraining facilities in Universities are likely to.be a limiting factor.Physics.165. The demand for physicists, which -has greatly increased during thewar, is expected to continue to expand after the war, despite a temporary falling off in the requirements for radio.166. The majority of those trained at Universities during the war havetaken a basic course in physics with a special subject in radio and have beenemployed in radio work. Those who become redundant from such work could be absorbed, with further training in appropriate cases, in branches of physicsother than radio, in metallurgy, in electrical engineering or in teaching.167. The pre-war annual supply of physicists should be increased by100 per cent.Applied Science (including Engineering).Aeronautical Engineering.168. Although aircraft production after the war will inevitably be reducedto a fraction of its present level, the aircraft industry will almost certainlyremain substantially above its pre-expansion strength and will devote a high proportion of its effort to research, design and development. Thus, althoughthe industry cannot hope to provide employment for all those partly- and fully-qualified engineers and other technicians who have acquired some knowledge ofaeronautics during the war, there will, when stable conditions are reached;undoubtedly be plenty of opportunities in the aeronautical field for well-qualifiedmen and the numbers required annually for aeronautical work will be substan-tially higher than before the war. The potentialities of aviation are so vastand of such importance to the security of the country that even during the transition period, when the aircraft industry is shedding a large part of itswar-time production staff, outstandingly able young men should be encouraged to seek a career in the field of design and development work. It is also expectedthat there will be a steady and substantial requirement for the Governmentaeronautical research establishments.
Agricultural Engineering.169. There will be greatly increased requirements for agriculturalengineers, but the specialised training facilities will be limited.Chemical Engineering and Fuel Technology.170. Before the war the supply of qualified chemical engineers in thiscountry was on a very small scale about 50 a year. It is expected that a supplyof twice this number will be needed in future. Training normally consists ofa four-year university course in chemical engineering, but may also be a post-graduate course following a degree course in chemistry or mechanical engineering.Although training facilities are limited there will be considerable opportunities for those who have already taken chemistry or mechanical engineering coursesto qualify as chemical engineers after their war service by means of a post-graduate course.171. A fuel technologist is a qualified engineer, chemist, or chemicalengineer, who has acquired special knowledge of fuels, and their productionand utilisation. The best qualification is a chemical enginering coursespecialising in the final year in fuel technology, or a chemical engineering coursefollowed by a post-graduate course in fuel technology. The Committee of theDepartment of Scientific and Industrial Research on the Supply of Fuel technological-logists forecast a greatly-increased demand for fuel technologists after the war.To some extent, post-war requirements could be met by post-graduate training-after war service of persons who have taken chemistry or engineering coursesduring the war. A considerable expansion of training capacity is likely to berequired.Civil Engineering.172. An estimate of the future prospects in civil engineering is especiallydifficult, as they depend on a number of uncertain factors the size of the labour force likely to be available in the civil engineering industry, the probable publicworks programme in this country, and the opportunities in overseas work. Onthe building construction side of civil engineering, which is the largest singlebranch of the profession, it may reasonably be estimated that the leeway inconstruction as well as the damage caused by the war in this country, europe and elsewhere cannot be overtaken in less than 20 years, and will provide con-siderable opportunities for British civil engineers.173. The Board of Trade point out that large construction contracts of thekind for which the services of civil engineers are needed have a special value for our international trade, because they bring in their train orders for british equipment and machinery. It is therefore of great importance to British trade that the country should be equipped with a sufficient number of qualified civilengineers to take on the overseas work which may be expected, and for which itis unlikely that the countries concerned will themselves have sufficient trainedpersons available.174. Before the war, the size of the profession was adequate to the demands made upon it; the Committee consider that a limited increase will be neededafter the war. During the war, training in civil engineering at the Universitieshas been restricted in view of the need for expansion in the output in mechanicaland electrical engineering/and it is estimated that at the end of hostilities the profession will be below strength to the number of at least 1,000. It is expectedthat most of this deficit will be met from men who have taken civil engineeringcourses during the war, or owing to war needs, have taken mechanical or electricalinstead of civil engineering courses. In view of the need for some increase inthe size of the profession, there will also be opportunities, to a more limited extent,for those who start civil engineering training after their war service.175. It is impracticable at the present time to forecast the annual supply of qualified civil engineers likely to be required after the early post-war years&quot;Mechanical and Electrical Engineering.176. A substantially increased demand for qualified mechanical and electrical engineers is expected after the war : a normal annual supply greater[29154] F
than before the war by 50 per cent, is likely to be required. On the manufac-turing side, there will be greater concentration on higher-grade products and onprecision engineering, and increased numbers of qualified mechanical and electrical engineers will be required for management and selling, as well as fordesign and development. Production engineering which is an important aspect of the manufacturing side of mechanical and electrical engineering hasexpanded during the war, and this tendency is expected to continue.177. In the early post-war years, the training capacity of industry, as wellas the Universities, is likely to be severely strained. The capacity of theengineering industry for the practical training of entrants above the secondary school level is limited, and is at present concentrated in a comparatively small number of the larger firms.Mining Engineering.178. In coalmining there has always been a considerable demand for personshaving the statutory qualifications required for managers and under managers,but in the past the majority of these have not attended a University. With the increasing mechanisation of the mines, it is hoped in the future to increase very greatly the proportion of engineers who have specialised in mining engineering ata University. The training of persons for managerial positions which cover the underground operations of the industry takes approximately 7-10 years. Therewill be limited opportunities for the employment of ex-Service men on the surface,where the technical training could be completed in a much shorter period.179. In metalliferous mining, the requirements are expected to be aboutthe same as before the war.Naval Architecture.180. Before the war the establishment of the Royal Corps of NavalConstructors was inadequate, and it is probable that the strength of the Corpswill be maintained at a higher level after the war. The largest source of recruit-ment for the Corps is from the dockyard apprentices; a proportion of recruitscome from Universities and the private shipbuilding firms.181. In private shipbuilding firms the proportion of qualified technical staff has remained low compared with the engineering industry as a whole, and this condition has been accentuated by the depression and uncertainty in the industry which prevailed between the two wars and by the low scale of salaries forqualified men.182. After the war the world tonnage of merchant shipping will be greaterthan at the beginning but British tonnage will be considerably less. Owing toadvances in technical processes during the war it is probable that two-thirds ofthe war-time loss of British tonnage, could be made good by the industrywithin two or three years; it is uncertain whether a return to, or an increasebeyond, the pre-war tonnage will be needed.183. There is now widespread recognition in the employers&apos; organisations and professional insitutions in the industry that the position in respect of recruit-ment of qualified technical staff is unsatisfactory, and that for the efficient working of the industry the proportion of qualified men should be raised. Therehas been an appreciable increase in the number of qualified men entering theindustry during the war, and it is expected that there will be a need for this increase in the supply to continue.184. There may be openings in naval architecture for a few men who havetaken engineering courses during the war, but have not previously been engagedin shipbuilding.Petroleum Engineering.185. The requirements of the petroleum industry for persons with technical qualifications are expected to be heavy, especially in the early post-war years.Secretarial Work (Company).186. The membership of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries in August1939 was 11,994. The average number of persons admitted to membershipannually in the five years before the war was 420; the average number of persons
admitted to membership annually in the years 1939 to 1943 inclusive was 270. Itis not possible to estimate the number of persons whose training has been inter-rupted by war service. Some students who are employed in reserved occupations and others who are resident in the Dominions or Colonies or are serving in theForces are known to be continuing their studies.187. The necessity for efficient organisation in industry and commerce, andthe extension of legal obligations on public companies, are likely to lead to anincreased demand for qualified secretaries. There should be good openings for persons who have been engaged in war service.Social Work.188. A university course in Social Science is the basic training for mostforms of social work. In order to reach an estimate of the number of men andwomen who should be encouraged to take university courses in Social Science afterthe war, it is necessary to consider the probable employment prospects in the mainoccupations concerned.Boarding-out Visitors.189. A substantial development of this service is expected, and it isestimated that an average of at least three boarding-out visitors may be requiredfor each county and county borough council. If the scheme develops as expected,a total of at least 350 additional officers will be required within five years, with anannual intake of about 70.Family Case Workers.190. Family case workers are at present employed entirely by voluntary bodies. It has not been possible to estimate post-war requirements, but it isexpected that some increase in intake will be required.General Social Workers.191. The Ministry of Health is considering a plan for the appointment of trained welfare workers by county and county borough councils to co-ordinate thework of existing agencies, voluntary and official, which include case work and home visiting, and also to fill any gaps in existing specialised services. If such a service were set up two welfare workers would be required for each authority,making a total of about 250. The full demand might take several years todevelop, and the annual intake in the five years after the war might be about 80.Hospital Almoners.192. The development of the National Health Service will certainlyincrease the demand for almoners in hospitals and may lead to their appointmentin Health Centres. A total of 1,000 almoners will probably be required inEngland and Wales within two years after the end of the war. There are now500 almoners; a total of 1,000 almoners could therefore be achieved with an intake of 200 in the first year after the end of the war, and 300 in the second. Intake atthis rate might then be continued or even accelerated for the subsequent five years,according to wastage and progress with Health Centres.193. It is estimated that an annual intake of 20 hospital almoners will be needed in Scotland in the early post-war years.Mental Deficiency Workers.194. From enquiries which the Board of Control have made of three selectedlocal authorities, it seems that there should be one mental deficiency worker per130,000 of the population, making a total of about 300 for the country. Thedemand may take some years to develop and the suggested intake is about 25a year.Moral Welfare Work.195. There is a very serious shortage of workers in all fields. In order tomeet increasing needs at home as well as openings overseas, an annual intake of 60will probably be required. Some of these will be able to take special short courses,but others will need the full social science training.[29154] F 2
Probation Officers.196. It is estimated that 200 additional probation officers will be needed inEngland and Wales in the first two years after the end of the war, 200 in thenext three years and 80 in the subsequent two years. About 20 of these wouldbe subsidised to take a university Social Science course each year. The Scottishintake&apos;of probation officers in the immediate post-war years might be about 6annually; although no special training has hitherto been required, a Social Sciencediploma would undoubtedly be of value to candidates otherwise suitably qualifiedby strength of character and personality.Psychiatric Social Workers.197. Assuming that the number of Local Education Authorities will beabout 150, that each of these will have to provide one or more child guidance teamsof workers to carry out their, duties under the Education Act and that each teamwill include two or three psychiatric social workers, the total number ofpsychiatric social workers required for child guidance will be about 500. Thenumber of psychiatric social workers required for Central. Psychiatric Clinics,Mental Hospitals, Certified Institutions for Defectives and for work underMedical Officers of Mental Health will depend on the development of the national health service, but it is estimated that a total of 300 would be a reasonable aim..The total number of psychiatric social workers required in Scotland for childguidance work and for the national health service in the three years following the war will probably be about 18.198. The annual intake in the years immediately following the war should probably be not more than 175.School Welfare Workers.199. The annual intake of qualified L.C.C. Care Committee Organisers andother social workers employed by Local Education Authorities in 1938 was approximately 10. No accurate estimate can be made of post-war requirements,but an expansion is expected.Other Occupations.200. A Social Science diploma is a useful preliminary qualification forpersonnel management, housing management and youth leadership (see underthese headings). It also leads to openings in community centre work and settle-ment work, for which it has not been possible to make any estimates of post-war requirements.   -Total Output Required.201. In the aggregate, the foregoing requirements would involve an output from Social Science courses of 800-950 per annum in the early post-war years, ascompared with a pre-war annual output of 250. Even if these figures are taken with some reserve, it is clear that there will be a large field of opportunity,especially for women.202. The Joint University Council for Social Studies and Public Adminis-tration consider that training facilities could, be provided for the estimated number of persons required for the social services. The London School of economics and the larger schools could not easily expand further, but the smallerschools in Universities or University Colleges would probably be able to do so ifthey were given some assurance that a sufficient number of students would come forward. Several Universities, which at present have no Social Science Depart-ments, are considering whether to set them up.203. The Joint University Council for Social Studies and Public Adminis-tration are considering whether a one-year course could be provided for men andwomen over the age of 25 who have had suitable experience during their war service.Statistics.204. The Committee are concerned only with statisticians of graduatestandard.205. The profession of statistician is a new one and there is considerableoverlap with a variety of other activities; for instance, statistical technique is used in some aspects of economic and scientific research. Twenty years ago therewere very few persons earning their living as statisticians.   Before the war the
number had increased, but evidence as to the number of men and women whodescribe themselves professionally as statisticians is scanty. The RoyalStatistical Society proposes to set up two examinations which will provide a professional qualification for statisticians: a diploma of university degreestandard and a certificate of somewhat lower standard. The Society do not intend to arrange tuition for these examinations, which will continue to be undertaken,as previously, by university courses or private reading.206. During the war the demand for statisticians has increased substan-tially in many fields of employment, notably in industry, e.g., for the qualitycontrol of manufactured goods, in scientific research, in industrial organisationand in the Civil Service. In consequence, statisticians are now in short supply,although a few students have been deferred from military service in order to qualify. Many of these developments have come to stay and some will continueto grow in scale after the war. In addition, there will be an increasing demandfor persons qualified to teach statistics in Universities and other educationalinstitutions.207. It is expected that there will be good opportunities for persons whohave been engaged in war service and have statistical aptitude. For most posts,advanced mathematical training is not necessary, but candidates require instruc-tion in statistical technique and practice in applying it.Teaching.208. Before the war the number of full-time teachers in schools and educational institutions grant-aided by the Ministry of Education and theScottish Education Department was approximately 230,000. During the warpractically no men have entered the profession, though&apos; a greatly reduced numberof men students have entered Teachers&apos; Training Colleges and have been reserved to complete a 5-term course before being called up for the Forces. In Scotland,where nearly all men entering the teaching profession are required to graduate,generally in Arts, this concession has had little effect, except in the case of studentsof physical training at one training centre.209. The Education Departments estimate that by 1945 the cumulative lossof new intake to the teaching profession will amount to about 25,000. Moreover,the educational proposals which have recently been before Parliament will involvea very large increase in the teaching profession. Within a period of five to tenyears after the end of hostilities, according to the progress of educationalreform, some 80,000 to 100,000 additional teachers will be required for grant-aided schools in England and Wales and Scotland taken together. A number of teachers will also be required for schools other than grant-aided schools. Thesefigures include requirements for teachers with special qualifications, e.g., inscience, languages, art, physical training. Of the numbers quoted it is estimatedthat a material proportion should have a university degree. There will be a severe problem of supply both in respect of numbers and of quality.210. It is clear that every encouragement should be given to suitable persons to consider training as teachers after the war. In addition to the opportunitiesunder the Further Education and Training Scheme, the Ministry of Educationare arranging intensive courses, and special financial assistance will be provided to enable suitable persons to train as teachers. Shortened courses of training will also be available in Scotland.211. The normal annual supply of qualified persons for the teaching profession before the war was about 8,000. Apart from the special intakerequired in the immediate post-war years, an annual supply of about 13,000 maybe needed in future.Town and Country Planning.212. The qualification for town planning is membership by examinationof the Town Planning Institute. The majority of entrants to the professionare already qualified as architects, surveyors or civil engineers.213. At present, only about 250 qualified persons are engaged in planning;in addition, a further 500 have planning qualifications or experience, but are not so engaged, a number of them being in the Forces or Civil Defence Services.
214. It is estimated that at least 1,600 qualified planners will be needed assoon as possible after the end of hostilities for England and Wales, and 200 forScotland, and that eventually the size of the profession should be about 3,000.215. It is expected that at the end of hostilities considerable numbers ofthose released from war. service who already have architectural, surveying or civil engineering qualifications will qualify as town planners^ The town planning Institute are arranging intensive courses of three months&apos;duration forsuch persons.   The maximum output from the courses Would be about 360 a year.216. In addition there will be openings in planning work for persons whobegin the full course of training after their war service.Transport.Merchant Navy.217. The normal method of entry for Navigating Officers is as apprenticeor cadet at the age of 16 after a secondary school education. The qualification of Second Mate&apos;s Certificate is normally obtained after four years&apos; sea service.218. Recruitment has continued during the war, but the qualifying period for temporary Second Mate&apos;s certificate has been reduced to three years.219. For Certificated Engineer Officers the qualification is 4 years&apos;apprenticeship in suitable mechanical engineering workshops, coupled with18 months&apos; sea service for a 2nd Class Certificate of Competency and a further18 months&apos; sea service for a First Class Certificate. (The qualifying sea service for a 2nd Class Certificate has, during the war, been reduced to 12 months.) the possession of a Ministry of War Transport Certificate of Competency as a MarineEngineer also leads to a variety of technical openings ashore.220. -The Merchant Navy Training Board is now reviewing the question ofthe training for the Merchant Navy after the war and has already reported onthe training of Navigating Officers and Deck. Ratings for the British merchant navy.221. It is known that a very considerable number of Merchant Navy Officersand men now serving in the Royal Navy and on Allied ships and held in enemyPrisoner-of-War Camps will wish to return to the Merchant Navy, and it seems unlikely that there will be immediate opportunities in the Merchant Navy formen demobilised from war service who have not already had sea experience.Shore Staffs of Shipping Companies.222. The managerial grades of the shore staffs of shipping firms are, withthe exception of a small proportion of university trained men, recruited frompersons who have entered the firms direct from school and acquired practical experience of the work.223. It is estimated that the existing staffs, supplemented by membersreturning after war service, will in the main be adequate to cope with the traffic in the early post-war years, and there are likely to be few openings for ex-servicemen who were not previously employed in shipping.224. The facilities for training within the industry are not wholly adequate,especially in the smaller firms engaged in tramp shipping, and it is desirablethat in future a larger proportion of university trained men should be recruitedto the industry.Land Transport.225. The number of persons with higher qualifications required for landtransport m the early post-war years is expected to be approximately the same as before the war. Owing to the drop in recruitment during the war it is expectedthat there will be opportunities for persons released from war service, especially those with qualifications in engineering and accountancy.226. On a longer view, it is probable that the trend of employment in landtransport will be on a rising curve after the initial adjustments have been madefollowing the end of hostilities with Germany.
Civil A ir Transport.227. So far as can be foreseen at present, Civil Air Transport operating in and from the United Kingdom and in the Colonies will require in the ,earlypost-war years not more than 1,000 persons with flying, technical or administra-tive qualifications and experience of the standard with which the Committee areconcerned, in addition to existing staff, including those at present on active service. The supply of men with such qualifications available from-war service is likely to bae greatly in excess of such requirements. The Committee considerthat it is impracticable at the present time to forecast requirements over a longer period.Valuation, Surveying and Estate Management.228.   The   figures   given   below   refer   to   the   following   professionalInstitutions : The Chartered Surveyors&apos; Institution.The Land Agents&apos; Society.The Auctioneers and Estate Agents&apos; Institute of the United Kingdom.The Incorporated Society of Auctioneers and Landed Property Agents.229. The combined membership of these professional Institutions, which tosome extent overlaps, is approximately 22,450. The members are divided intothe following main branches : valuers, building surveyors, quantity surveyors,mining surveyors, land agents, urban estate agents and auctioneers.Valuation and Surveying.230. The pre-war intake to the valuation side of the profession which was approximately 130 per annum has dropped by two-thirds during the war. Inview of the post-war building programme it is probable that a substantially greater number of qualified valuers will be needed than before the war and anannual intake of twice the pre-war number is likely to be required in the imme-diate post-war years.  - -231. The post-war building programme will also create a demand for a greatly-increased number of quantity and building surveyors. It is estimatedthat before the. war there were approximately 3,000 senior quantity surveyorsand 1,100 juniors, of whom about 1,800 were professionally qualified. The pre-war annual intake of about 70 has dropped by about half during the war.Assuming that the proportion of building work on which quantity surveyors are engaged will be 10 per cent, greater than before the war, it is estimated thatat the peak of the building programme the total number of quantity surveyorsrequired will be about 6,000, i.e., 50 per cent, more than before the war. The totalnumber of professionally qualified building surveyors is about 1,800. Theaverage annual intake before the war was about 65, and during the war thishas dropped by about two-thirds. The reconstruction programme will give riseto a heavy demand probably two or three times the normal volume in this branch of the profession-232. The total number.of qualified mining surveyors is about 100 and theaverage annual intake before the war was about 5. Prospects in this branchof the profession are difficult to estimate at the present time, but they are unlikely to differ appreciably from the pre-war requirements.233. There are about 1,800 probationers and students of the CharteredSurveyors&apos; Institution at present on war service who should be encouraged tocomplete their qualifications after the war. In addition there will also be goodopportunities for those who start training as valuers and surveyors after their war service.Estate Management. -234. Before the war the approximate annual intake to the land agency sideof the profession was 140 and to the urban side was 350. During the war theaverage annual intake has dropped by almost two-thirds. It is estimated thatin the future the size of the profession will need to be about the same as beforethe war. On the rural side, it is likely that there will be a decrease in thenumber of resident land agents, but an increase in the&apos;requirements for landagents in general practice and consultation.
235. In view of the drop in recruitment during the war, there Will belimited opportunities for persons who start training in the profession after their war service.Veterinary  Service.236. The total number of veterinary surgeons in Great Britain is approxi-mately 2,300. The average number of those qualifying annually before the war was 136, and during the war has been 200.237. The Committee on Veterinary Education in Great Britain estimate intheir second report that the annual output required should not be less than 220for the first ten years after the war. They are of opinion that, if full effect isgiven to the present policy of the Government and the needs of the Colonies areto be fully satisfied, this figure may prove to be an under-estimate.238. The demand for non-specialised veterinary surgeons is likely to exceed the supply. There will be. more than sufficient openings in Britain and theColonies to absorb within three years all the 300 to 400 men engaged in war service who are already qualified or whose M.R.C.V.S. course was interrupted.Those whose course was interrupted will need to complete it whether they are going into the Animal Health Service or into private practice. Entrants to theAnimal Health Service will be given the necessary additional training before taking up their duties. Further training will be needed for a limited number ofmen (say 20 to 30 per annum for three or four years) to fill scientific and teachingposts. Candidates should have obtained a science degree with subjects whichcarry exemption from the first two years of the M.R.C.V.S. curriculum.239. There will also be opportunities for persons who start training after their war service.Youth Leadership.240. &quot;Before the war youth leadership was left entirely to voluntary bodies,most of which relied on part-time unpaid volunteers with no special training. Thetotal number of full-time paid leaders in 1939&apos;was about 350.241. During the war the Governments policy of developing the youthservices has led to an increase in the demand for full-time paid leaders. In theyears 1940-44 it is estimated that the number of full-time paid leaders has beendoubled, making a total of approximately 700 in England and Wales, and, duringthe same period, about 160 paid leaders have been recruited in Scotland.   -242. It is estimated in the report of the McNair Committee that ultimatelya total of between 5,000 and 6,000 full-time youth leaders will be required for england and Wales. This estimate would seem to represent the maximum number and it is clear that some time must.elapse before the actual number couldbe within measurable distance of that estimate. In Scotland a service ultimatelyemploying about 800 full-time leaders appears to be feasible.243. The McNair Committee estimate that an annual recruitment of about300 will be necessary. This is twice the present rate of increase and it is very doubtful whether it will be reached immediately after the war or maintained forany length of time. In Scotland an annual intake of 80 in the first year afterthe war, rising to 250 in three or four years&apos; time, and thereafter falling awayto a normal intake of about 50 is suggested. It seems reasonable to expect thatthere will be opportunities as youth leaders for candidates who have the rightqualities or personality with some educational attainment.244. There is at present no recognition of any specific qualification forappointments to posts in the youth service. The McNair Committee have recom-mended that three-year courses of training should be provided for those without special qualifications and one-year courses for those whose previous experience and qualifications make a three-year course unnecessary; the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations are now under consideration by the Minister of Education.December 1944.
