THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal me of.................TOP SECRET n- - ai**      5 3W.P. (45) 125. -fftovioor)-3rd March, 1945.WAR CABINET.REDEPLOYMENT PLAN.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.AT &quot;Argonaut,&quot; the Combined Chiefs of Staff instructed the appropriatecommittees to prepare a combined plan for redeployment after the defeat ofGermany and to relate that plan to the availability of personnel shipping. Thisreport is to be submitted to the Combined Chiefs of Staff not later than the1st April, 1945.2. Before the British Staffs can complete this report in collaboration withthe United States Staffs in Washington, it is necessary for us to give them someguidance on the question of priority for the various movements which will berequired in the first six months after Germany&apos;s defeat. This question involvesmany political considerations.3. We therefore submit, in broad outline, the main conclusions already reached and the points on which we require Ministerial guidance.Calls on British Personnel Shipping for the First Sioc Months after Germany^Defeat.4. The calls on British personnel shipping during the six months afteiGermany&apos;s defeat can be broadly stated under three main headings. Against eaclmain item we have indicated any relevant decision or statement by His Majesty&apos;kGovernment in the United Kingdom or by Dominion Governments.The lists below are not arranged in order of priority either between the three classes or within them.A. Moves for A proved Operations.(i) For the Pacific-The British Pacific Fleet.  The V.L.R. Bomber Force.Dominion Forces for early participation in the war against Japan,(ii) For South-East Asia Command. Army, Navy and Air Force units,including the preliminary moves from the Mediterranean to theUnited Kingdom for reorganisation, and the return of Indian troops to India.(iii) Movements within the Bay of Bengal.The Final Report of the &quot; Argonaut &quot; Conference approved by thePresident and the Prime Minister re-affirms the intention tore-orient forces from the European theatre to the Pacific and FaiEast as a matter of highest priority, having regard to otheiagreed and /or inescapable commitments as soon as the Germansituation allows.[29284]
B. Other British Moves of a Military Nature.(i) Dominion reorganisation for the war against Japan.The importance of Dominion reorganisation for the war against japan is covered by the statement in the Final &quot;Argonaut.&quot;Report referred to above. Moreover, the New Zealand Govern-ment have stated that it is their wish that arrangements shouldbe made for New Zealand forces in the Mediterranean theatreto be repatriated as early as possible after the defeat of germany or earlier if this should be decided upon.(ii) Repatriation and Release Scheme (including PYTHON).His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed to the policy of repatriatingmembers of His Majesty&apos;s forces with long service overseas.His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed to a policy of release of personnel from the Forces set out in a Government White Paperdated September 1944.(iii) Leave Scheme.His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed to a scheme for grantingleave (LIAP) for those who are serving overseas. They are alsocommitted to a leave scheme for giving leave to British membersof the Indian Army who have served for 3 years 8 months in theFar East.(iv) Return of South African Defence Force.His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate the desire of the UnionGovernment that the South African forces should be repatriatedas early as possible and their policy is that every effort will bemade to meet this wish consistent with operational requirements.(v) Return of Canadian forces other than those included in (i) above.The Canadian Government have expressed the opinion that whenhostilities with Germany cease,&quot; Canadian forces should be repatriated from the European theatre as quickly as circum-stances will permit, in proportion to the number of United states forces returned to the United States. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s attitude is the same as for the return of the South AfricanDefence Force.(vi) Return of Colonial Forces.We are not aware of any statement of Government policy on thissubject.(vii) Movements within the Mediterranean, including the build-up of theImperial Strategic Reserve,(viii) Return of British Commonwealth prisoners of war.We understand that it is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthe return of these prisoners is a matter of great importance andmust be effected as early as possible.C. Other Moves.(i) Government Servants.(ii) Staffs of commercial and industrial concerns whose work is of highnational importance.(iii) British evacuees and refugees.(iv) Families of British service men and Government officials.(v) Wives of Dominion and Colonial service men in. the United Kingdom.We are not aware of any statement of policy by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on the above requirements.5. Before we show the total figure for movement represented by the abovelists we should point out that (a) We have included only 50 per cent, of the full commitment for the return of South African Defence Force, the return of Canadian forces andthe return of Colonial forces, since it is improbable that they would all be moved in the first six months after Germany&apos;s defeat.
(b) We have not included any figure for the return of enemy prisoners of war.(c) We have not included military or civilian moves other than British and american. The terms under which Allied troopships are included inthe British-controlled troop fleet entitle Allies to put forward theirbids for such, moves. We expect, for example, that both the Frenchand the Dutch will make bids. We are, however, unable to assess&apos; either the size of Allied bids or the extent to which it will eventually be decided to meet them.6. Figures for alb probable calls on British personnel shipping for the first six months after Germany&apos;s defeat, shown in paragraph 4 above, can then betabulated as follows : Out. Home. Total.Moves for Approved Operations 565,050 106,000 671,050Other    British    Moves    of    aMilitary Nature        ...       ... 520,600 294,000 814,600Otiier J\4!oves       ...       ...       ... 46,500 30,000 76,5001,132,150        430,000     1,562,150United States Request for Allocation of British Troop Shipping.7. The United States have asked for the continuation of a trans-Atlanticmovement of 70,000 men per month to be provided from British resources afterthe defeat of Germany, which is approximately the same lift as was given tothe Americans for the build-up of &quot; Overlord.&quot; They asked for this assistancein order to enable them to accomplish the quickest possible redeployment of their forces to the Pacific, and the figures given to us at &quot; Argonaut &apos;&apos; showed that even if their full request were granted, they would still have a deficit of over59,000 in the total troop lift required by them for the last quarter of 1945.&apos; 8. We have goOd reason to believe that the Americans will support their case for this assistance with arguments on the following lines : 1(a) The primary Anglo-American objective must be to bring to the speediestpossible end the war against Japan. - It will, therefore, be imperative that our combined resources be allocated strictly in accordance withthat objective.(b) It is the operations leading to the direct assault on Japan which willmost quickly bring about the end of the war in the Far East, andPacific requirements should, therefore, have priority over the require-ments of South-East Asia Command.(c) Although allocation of resources as suggested in [a) and (b) above maydelay other important movements, nothing is so urgent as the earliestpossible end of the war, and this is a point of view which it shouldbe possible to persuade British public opinion to accept during the six months immediately following the defeat of Germany.9. It will not be easy to refute these arguments.on strategic grounds andcertain of our big ships cannot be employed economically except on the North.Atlantic route. Nevertheless, to give the Americans the full assistance theyhave asked for, especially without a quid pro quo on other routes, would involvea reduction in other British movements of high political importance. There are,therefore, arguments in favour of meeting the Americans to some extent in theNorth Atlantic, in return for assistance elsewhere. We require guidance fromthe Cabinet on how we should deal with this point. If it should be decided togive such assistance to the United States, we feel very strongly that no conditionshould be attached to the use which the Americans make of this lift.Availability of British-controlled Troop Lift.10. We give below an example of the measure of our ability (after makinga conservative allowance for air-trooping) to meet our requirements from British-controlled shipping. (a) We calculate that if no assistance were given to the Americans for theirtrans-Atlantic movement, British requirements for &apos;&apos; ApprovedOperations &apos;&apos; could be met, leaving some surplus capacity availablefor other British moves but not enough for all the requirements of&quot; Other British Moves of a Military Nature.&quot;
(b) If the full assistance requested by the Americans were given, british requirements, for &quot;Approved Operations&quot; could be met, but therewould be little surplus left for other British requirements.11. With regard to &quot; Other Moves,&quot; we appreciate that within some monthsof Germany&apos;s defeat there will be a demand for the re-establishment of regularImperial Communications. An examination of &quot; Other Moves &quot; shows thatcivilian requirements could partially be met in the ballast voyages of troopshipsor in the smaller cargo liners. On some routes, however, civilian requirements would definitely be in competition with military needs and could only be met atthe expense of some cut in the latter.12. We have examined the possibility, of increasing our available troop liftby the use of cargo ships. We find, however, that although the return oftroops from the Mediterranean to the United Kingdom for release might be accelerated by the use of cargo ships temporarily adapted to carry troops, noassistance towards our main redeployment programmes can.be anticipated fromthis source.Allocation of Priorities.13. Since it is clear that British-controlled personnel shipping will be insufficient to meet British requirements and give the assistance requested bythe Americans, we must give our Staffs in Washington some guidance on priorities.In order to ensure the most economical use of shipping, it is essential to retainas much flexibility as possible in formulating shipping programmes. It wouldbe unnecessarily restrictive at this stage to lay down a hard and fast priority of movement.14. What we require, therefore, is a decision on the question of assistanceto the Americans, the extent of that assistance, if any is to be given, and whether we should ask for any compensating facilities. We also require guidance as to therelative importance, from the political point of view, of the movements listed inparagraph 4.Conclusions.15.   We ask, therefore, that the War Cabinet should (a) Decide whether British assistance should continue to be given to theUnited States after the defeat of Germany, at the expense of Britishmovement; the extent of this assistance, if any is to be given; andwhether we should ask for any compensating facilities./b) Give us such general guidance as they feel able to provide as to therelative importance, from the political point of view, of the commit-ments listed in paragraph 4 above.16. With this information we should be able to complete, in conjunctionwith the United States Chiefs of Staff, a combined redeployment plan which will show the timings of the various movements to be carried out in the six monthsfollowing Germany&apos;s defeat. This plan, when approved by the Combined Chiefsof Staff, will be submitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government ofthe United States.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.C.
