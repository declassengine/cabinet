THE WOMEN&apos;S LAND ARMY POST-WAR AND WELFARE SCHEME.

MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.

1. On the authority of the War Cabinet (W.M. (45) 21st Conclusions, Minute 1) I made a statement on the 20th February giving an assurance that the question of financial assistance for the Women&apos;s Land Army was receiving the Government&apos;s sympathetic consideration.

2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have worked out a special scheme for the Women&apos;s Land Army, on lines indicated by the War Cabinet (W.M. (45) 19th Conclusions, Minute 4).

3. In the light of the conclusions of the War Cabinet on the 22nd February (W.M. (45) 24th Conclusions, Minute 3), I now ask for approval of the terms of the attached statement. The Minister of Labour has reiterated his view that any concession to the Women&apos;s Land Army will lead to representations from other industries which will be difficult to resist. I hope, however, that the risk will be taken. The atmosphere surrounding recruitment for, and service in, the Land Army sets them in a class apart from other war workers.

4. The Women&apos;s Land Army organisation and members, and the general public, expect an early announcement of a scheme for the Women&apos;s Land Army. My statement on the 20th February gave rise to such an expectation and the Minister of Labour himself stated on the 15th February in answer to a supplementary question on the Business Grants scheme, that "the Women&apos;s Land Army will be dealt with in another way."

5. As a result of the present uncertainty applications for enrolment in the Women&apos;s Land Army are already falling. Indeed, in the London area they fell by 50 per cent during last week. If an announcement should now be made that nothing is to be done for the Land Army, I shall inevitably be faced with resignations on a large scale by County Chairmen and Organisers, District Representatives and County Secretaries of the W.L.A. organisation. Without them the machine would break down. Moreover, recruitment would be brought to a standstill, while wastage would continue. As a result, the Land Army would rapidly decrease at a time when the man-power position in agriculture is critical.

6. These are no idle fears. The Secretary of State for Scotland and I view the outlook for man-power in agriculture this year with the very gravest anxiety. If in addition to other difficulties we are faced with a serious reduction over the next few months in the size of the Land Army, and acute dissatisfaction amongst those that remain, I frankly see no prospect of obtaining the food required - especially sugar-beet and potatoes.

R.S.H.
Draft Statement by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Government has given careful consideration to the position of membersof the Women&apos;s Land Army in relation to schemes for financial assistance to women released from the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services. As I explained to theHouse on the 20th February, there are differences between conditions of recruit-ment and service which precluded treatment on the same basis. Neither thewearing of uniform nor the description of the force as aif Army, provides adequatejustification in itself for parity of treatment between members of the W.L.A.and women in the Auxiliary and Civil Defence Services.The Government recognises that members of the Women&apos;s Land Army have rendered services of the highest value to the war effort, that they have voluntarilyundertaken a form of service which has involved considerable financial sacrifice,and that they have been required to give an undertaking to serve in whatever-part of the country may be required. Most of them are living away from home,and many in remote and isolated places, and the cash wage they receive, afterpaying for their board and lodging, is inadequate to meet current expenses and still leave any margin for savings. Moreover, the services of members of theW.L.A. will continue to be required in agriculture until at least the end of thewar with Japan.While, therefore,, the Government is not able to agree that members of theW.L.A. should be treated on the same basis as women in the Auxiliary and civil defence Services, the Government proposes to make an outfit allowance of  12 10s.to any member upon being giving willing release from the Land Army, providedthat she has given satisfactory service for not less than six months; and for those members who undertake to continue in the Land Army for not less than one year after the defeat of Germany, to pay a cash bonus at the rate of 4s. per month for each month of service, payable on completion of service, but subject to aminimum period of six months&apos; service.Members of the W.L.A. are eligible to participate on equal terms withwomen in other war industries in the schemes for further education and trainingwhich have already been announced. We are proposing to give special considera-tion to those members of the Land Army who satisfy the essential conditions andwho wish.to undergo education and training with a view to making a careerin agriculture or horticulture.
