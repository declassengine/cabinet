THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.       &apos; &apos; 1W.P. (45) 127.1st March, 1945.-  YjTAR CABINET.DIVORCE.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.IN a Paper which I circulated to the War Cabinet on the 17th December, 1943(W.P. (43) 573), I drew attention to the large demand for divorce which thenexisted, and suggested that the spate of divorce cases was not likely to fall offfor a long time. In particular I referred to the large number of divorce casesinvolving members of the Forces, and pointed out that it is very hard on a servingsoldier to have to wait an indefinite time before this crisis in his domestic affairs is settled.The consideration of that Paper by the War Cabinet* led to decisions which resulted in the introduction and passing of a Bill-the Supreme Court ofJudicature (Amendment) Bill, 1944--whicn authorised the appointment of threeadditional Judges. These Judges were duly appointed in February 1944, andwere all allocated to the Divorce Division, bringing the total number of judges in that Division up to eight. At the same time I instituted new arrangementsfor taking all classes of divorce at Assizes a facility of which full use hasbeen made.2. In the twelve months which have elapsed since the three new Judgeswere appointed there has been an increase in the demand for divorce which hasmore than fulfilled my prediction. In the year 1944 no less than 19,155 petitionsfor divorce were filed in England and Wales an increase of 3,600 on the figure for 1943. , This compares with 10,350 petitions filed in 1938, then a record number which was mainly attributable to the passing of the Herbert Act in 1937. Since1940, the figures of petitions filed have been as follows : - *    --;1941 ............ 8,3881942 ..........      ... 12,1311943.........      ... 15,523v           1944 ............ 19,155Although the additional Judges, and the facilities for taking divorce at Assizesresulted in some 14,770 decrees being pronounced by the Courts in 1944, a largenumber of petitions remained undisposed of at the close of the year. In Londonalone 2,992 cases had to be carried over to the new Term. It is true that thefacilities for taking divorce at Assizes have not yet been available for a full year,but from enquiries I have made, I am satisfied that the divorce lists in theprovinces are &quot;so heavy (there were 600 cases in Birmingham in December) thatthe existing arrangements both in London and the provinces are inadequate,and that something must be done to deal with the arrears of work which are fastpiling up.There are two points here. First, the Services Divorce Department of theLaw Society which handles divorce cases for the three Services is greatly inarrears with its work. But a small increase in the staff of this organisation(which is urgently necessary) would result in the Service cases being made ready for hearing at the courts at a rate far greater than&apos; the courts could absorb them under the present arrangements. Second, although the Divorce Judges havemade the most strenuous efforts to reduce arrears in the undefended cases, thereduction is only made at the expense of the defended cases, where there is a* W.M.

real issue to be tried between the parties and which consequently take far longer to dispose of. The result is that&apos;the defended lists kre now some eight months in arrears.3. From enquiries I have made there is no reason to suppose that the peak of the demand for divorce has yet been reached. If the figures for the last war are any guide, the peak will probably not be reached until the year after the virtual end of hostilities. The conclusion I have come to is that the Judgescannot hope to deal with the volume of cases, and I think it would be a pity to wait for public outcry before talking steps to meet the situation.4. One obvious solution would.be to appoint more.Judges. But I am veryunwilling to ask Parliament to authorise the appointment of more Judges to dealsolely with undefended divorce cases. I have consulted the Lord Chief justice and the President of the Divorce Division and I find that they agree with methat the time has come for some delegation of the functions of trying undefendeddivorce. I do not think it would be right to give the work to the County Court.There is much to be said for keeping-the trial of all matrimonial causes in theHigh Court, where the long experience of Judges and officials in this class ofwork is particularly valuable, and where a common standard can best bemaintained.The solution I propose is that undefended divorce cases, or special classesof such cases, should be tried by Registrars of the Divorce Court, and that theyshould be empowered to try these cases not only in London but in the provinces.The Registrars would have all the powers of a Judge to dispose of a case andin particular they would have to sit in open court in my view an essential condition. - A Registrar would have the right to refer cases of difficulty to a judge, and, being an officer of the Divorce Division, would be under the direction and control of the President. The details of the scheme would have to be worked out between the President and myself, but that is the proposal inprinciple. By concentrating on the undefended cases, the Divorce Registrarswill give considerable relief to the Judges who would, then be better able to devote time to the defended cases and to other cases of special difficulty.5. This suggestion would need legislation to give it effect, and I ask for authority to have the necessary Bill prepared.Quite a simple Bill with one main operative Clause would seem to be enough,though as I am projecting a more extensive measure &quot; for improving theadministration of justice,&quot; which would consist of several Parts each dealingwith an urgent bit of reform, it might be that in the end it would be best to put the extended jurisdiction of divorce registrars into the more general Bill. Forthe present, however, I ask for authority to go on with a separate Bill for thisspecific object.6. A proposal that even undefended divorce cases should be tried by aRegistrar will attract criticisms from the&apos;opponents of easy divorce. The lastthing that I desire is to see the machinery for granting divorces reduced to the automatic methods governing post-office business. I suggest that my proposal will tend to produce the opposite effect. At the present moment it is well nighimpossible for a Judge faced with the task of disposing of 500 to 600 Undefendedpetitions to hear each case both with the requisite dignity and with due despatch.The Registrar will in all respects fill the position of the Judge, but he will have more time to do the work.. S.House of Lords, S.W. 1,1st March, 1945.
