THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945%I1SECRET. \. Copy No.W.P. (45) 138.5th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.GREECE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I have already circulated to my colleagues the record of discussions onGreece held at the British Embassy in Athens on the 15th February, 1945(R. 3559/4/G). Annex I to that paper was a memorandum by the resident minister, Central Mediterranean, containing proposals for the future Britishorganisation in Greece once the immediate operational phase is over. In thediscussions at Athens on the 15th February, Mr. Macmillan&apos;s proposals were broadly accepted, and I should now be glad to learn whether the War cabinet would agree to endorse them. The Foreign Office could then pursue with theother interested Departments consideration of any detailed points which may benecessary.2. The basis of Mr. Macmillan&apos;s proposals is that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have undertaken very heavy commitments in Greece and that we shall bedeeply involved in Greek affairs for a considerable time to come. It is, however,important that our military commitments in the country should be reduced as rapidly as possible and that we should be enabled to withdraw a substantial partof the large British garrison at.present stationed in Greece. The speed and extentto which our forces in Greece can be reduced will depend on the ability of theGreek Government to resume control over the country. It is abundantly clear that,if left to themselves, the Greek Government will be quite incapable of establishingan effective administration, and British advice and guidance will be required inalmost every branch of the Government. The necessary British organisations for providing this guidance are for the most part in existence in Athens, and if allgoes well it is anticipated that by April it may be possible for the British garrisonto be reduced from 3 to 2 divisions and for a further division to be withdrawn byabout June.3. Although it will probably not be possible to reduce the British garrisonto 1 division until the end of June, what may be called the operational phaseshould be over well before then. It would, therefore, be appropriate that GeneralScobie should be relieved of many of the responsibilities which at present rest on him, and the Resident Minister&apos;s memorandum suggests a way in which theBritish organisation in Greece should be put on a predominantly civilian insteadof a military basis.4. These changes will not involve any significant increase in personnel or inthe extent of the responsibility which we already exercise. It must, however, becontemplated that it will not be possible to reduce this organisation or the scopeof our activities in Greece for some months. Any attempt to do so might well delay the withdrawal of the British forces, which is our primary aim, or necessitatetheir return to deal with fresh disorders.5. It may be argued that, if this elaborate organisation is established in greece, we shall have to assist the country for many years to come and will thus become involved in heavy financial and economic commitments. It may not bepossible to avoid giving some measure of economic and financial assistance to greece in the future, but I do not think that this question is likely to be affectedby the steps taken to deal with the immediate problem. The present position isthat we have been forced to undertake responsibilities in Greece from which wecannot at present escape.    I should certainly hope, however, that the Greek12688   [29365]
Government will fairly rapidly become capable of running the various branchesof the administration . themselves and that it will therefore be possibleprogressively to dispense with British support. I see no prospect at present ofelaborating any time schedule for this process nor of estimating what may be thefinal extent of our commitments in the country.6. The Foreign Office are ready to assume control of the functions whichit is suggested should be transferred to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy fromGeneral Scobie, and if the War Cabinet approve the proposals in principle, thedetails of the transfer will be worked out with the War Office and other interested departments. T would also suggest that once a measure of agreement has beenreached, it would be advisable that the United States Government should beinformed of our plans and should be invited to associate themselves with our policy. Their assistance will be particularly needed in regard to economic andfinancial matters.A. E.Foreign Office, 5th March, 1945.
