THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;B GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET. Copy No. %i-----W.P. (45) 116. /23rd February, 1945.   .WAR CABINET.LOSSES TO AIRCRAFT CARRYING OFFICIAL PASSENGERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.AT their meeting on the 5th February, 1945, I was invited by the WarCabinet (W.M. (45) 14th Conclusions, Minute&apos;2 Confidential Annex) to (a) render a report as soon as details were available regarding the loss of(1) the Expeditor aircraft carrying the-two Members of Parliament,and (2) the York aircraft carrying members of the British Commissionto the Yalta Conference;(5) submit a return setting out the accident rate of the normal passenger-carrying services of Transport Command during the previous twelvemonths;(c) prepare a report, for the same period, of the number of occasions on which united States aircraft had crashed in this country causing casualties to civilians and damage to property.The Minister of Home Security has undertaken to furnish the information required under (c).As for (&amp;), I attach an appendix showing accidents for the trunk routes andfeeder services of Transport Command for the period May 1944 to January 1945.It is not practicable to prepare a return covering the last twelve months, as beforeMay 1944 the records for these services were not separated from those of otherflying carried out by the Command.There remains (a).   The report is as follows : (i) Loss of Expeditor.The Expeditor left Rome for Brindisi on the morning of the 23rd January.It carried two Members of Parliament and other passengers.Other Members of Parliament left Rome in another Expeditor aircraft threeminutes later. The second aircraft encountered a severe snowstorm near itsdestination; the pilot decided to turn back and he made a precautionary landing at Bari.Nothing has been heard or seen of the first aircraft since it took off.It was the intention to provide a Dakota for the whole party but none&apos;was available on the day the flight took place. The Expeditor is, however,frequently used for conveying important passengers. The Commander-in-Chiefconsiders that it is well-suited for communication flights such as that from Rometo Brindisi. Expeditors were first used by the Command five months ago andthis is the only fatal accident which has occurred. The aircraft is also used for communication purposes by the R.A.F. and the U.S.A.A.F. in other theatres ofwar; it is also intensively used in North America.The crews of both Expediters had had previous experience not only of flyingthis type in Italy but also of special flights with important passengers. Bothaircraft carried normal radio equipment. Both were provided with dinghies andparachutes. .A Court of. Enquiry has been held. The findings revealed a number ofdefects in procedure.   I have discussed the findings with the Commander-in-[29268]
Chief. He has made supplementary enquiries and the following conclusionshave now emerged : Pilot&apos;s Responsibilities.(i) How the aircraft was lost can only be a matter of surmise; but themost likely explanation is that the pilot inadvisedly tried to press on m the face of local bad weather instead of turning back, as the pilot of the secondaircraft did, and that the aircraft crashed into the sea.(ii) The nose compartment had not been ballasted by placing some ofthe baggage in it, as .the pilot had been warned was desirable. This mayhave made the aircraft tail-heavy and caused temporary loss of control in conditions of turbulence and bad visibility. The stowage of the baggageis the responsibility of the pilot.(iii) The weather-briefing given to the pilot, in the opinion of theCommander-in-chief, was of a nature to justify the flight, but the weatherforecasts came through to the Station at hourly intervals and at the timeof briefing the next one (the 9 a.m. report) was due in a few minutes. Itwas suggested to the pilot that he might wait for this report, but he pre-ferred to do without it. In any event it would have been a wise precautionto have asked for an actual weather report to be telephoned from Brindisi.Had the pilot done this, he would have learned that the airfield had justbecome unserviceable because of a strong cross-wind.(iv) The pilot should have given advance notice to the Base OperationsRoom at the airfield qf departure that important passengers were being&quot; carried. This would have enabled the Station, as required by instructions,to send out, in advance of the flight, particulars of the aircraft&apos;s call-signand route. If this had been done, the Flying Control Organisation in EasternItaly could have got in touch with the aircraft in flight and diverted it fromBrindisi to another destination; and this they would have done.(v) The instructions provide that crews should be on the airfield onehour before take off in the case of. flights involving important passengers.In this instance, the pilot arrived late with the unfortunate result that thenavigator had to be sent to the aircraft&apos;at once to make the arrangements with the ground crews and so could not be present for briefing.In sum: though there is a natural reluctance to blame a deceasedofficer who cannot, be heard in his own defence it is difficult to avoid the conclusion, which the C commander-in-Chief has formed, that the pilotis mainly responsible for the accident.United Stores Station Authorities.There were also failures on the part of the authorities of the Station, whichwas manned by personnel of the United States Air Transport Command. Thus : (i) A telephone message for the pilots, which emanated from the R.A.F.at Brindisi, to the effect that bad weather might be encountered was not passed on to the pilots by the Senior Officer (U.S.A.T.C.) of the BaseOperations Room at the Station.(ii) The United States Operations Officer responsible for clearing theaircraft failed to insert on the clearance form an alternative airfield whichcould be used in the event of Brindisi being unserviceable.(iii) No pre-flight signals were sent, as required by the instructionsgoverning carriage of important passengers. It is true that, through theneglect of the pilot, no advance notice was given that important passengerswould be carried; but the Operations Officer who cleared the aircraft Vastold just before the flight started that at least one important passenger wason board.It would be unfortunate if publicity were directed to what may appear to be shortcomings of the United States Station Authorities,seeing that, in the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief, these did notcause the loss and that the responsibility rested with the pilot for notobserving the instructions for the conveyance of important passengers-Commanding Officer of the Communications Squadron.The Commander-in-Chief feels that a measure of responsibility for themishap must also rest with the Wing Commander  in command of  the
Communications Squadrons of which the Expeditors formed part. His reasons are : -(i) The deceased pilot, though a competent officer with a good warrecord, was evidently lacking in a sense of responsibility and ought not tohave been put in charge, as he was, of the two Expeditors carrying importantpassengers.(ii) The instructions to the pilot were inadequate.(iii) The Squadron Commander did not exercise sufficient supervision.He assumed that the R.A.F. officer, who acted as the R.A.F. representative at the United States airfield of departure, would look after the arrangements;this officer, however, belonged to a non-flying administrative unit which is neither qualified, nor intended, to exercise any responsibility in connectionwith flying.It is true that the Squadron Commander was not immediatelyresponsible for what occurred, but it is clear that his supervision wasnot all that it should have been. He has been relieved of his command and has lost his acting rank.The instructions regarding the carriage of important passengers in the command are being revised and it will again be brought home to all concerned that more than the usual precautions must be taken in all cases of flights whichare not of operational urgency and involve important passengers.(ii) Accident to the York.The aircraft set off for the Yalta Conference on the 1st February.The first stage of the flight was to have been United Kingdom to Naples. .The flight was uneventful until after the aircraft had passed over Corsica,when the weather started to deteriorate. When it reached Naples there wasthick cloud right down to sea level and the pilot rightly decided not to land therebut to fly on to Malta.He had sufficient petrol&apos; for this.He flew to the western tip of Sicily and then, on the strength of wirelessbearings received from Malta, steered a course to that island.He did not, however, reach Malta. Eventually he found that he was flyingover Lampedusa Island and his petrol supplies were giving out. . He then broughthis aircraft down with care on the sea. Shortly afterwards there was an explosion and the aircraft sank rapidly.The crew of the aircraft were highly experienced.It is not as yet known how the aircraft arrived over Lampedusa Islandinstead of over its destination at Malta. The accident is being investigated by aCourt of Inquiry and further details will become available shortly.The pilot and the navigator were among the survivors.A. H. M.

The figures marked thus * are estimated.2. Hours flown figures are estimated from mileage flown based on an average ground speed of 150 m.p.h.3. Tire jDrocedure for obtaining reports of minor accidents in overseas units has recentlybeen improved. The small figures of reported accidents in May and June may have been due tosome minor accidents not being reported. This does not affect fatal accidents, which are alwaysreported.4. The above figures give the record for the main Trunk and Feeder Services. transport command also carry a considerable number of passengers in support of front line organisationsin Europe, and in aircraft being ferried to various Commands.5. From November onwards, hours flown figures are provisional and some additional minoraccidents may still be reported for January.6. The figures in the column &apos;&apos; Total Accidents &apos;&apos; relate to accidents not due to enemyMotion involving damage taking longer than 48 hours to repair, necessitating a replacement of a major component or involving injury to any person necessitating longer than 48 hours in hospital.7.   A    Serious accident &quot; is one involving death or injury to any passenger.APPENDIX.Transport Command Trunk Routes and Feeder Services.Accident Record.
