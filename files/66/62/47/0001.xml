E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,7th March, 1945.   &apos;ANNEX I.Telegram No. 47 from Canada to the Dominions Office, dated 2ord February, 1945.Following from the Prime Minister for your Prime Minister : 1. I should like you to know that I attach very great importance to theviews on trade policy set forth in our telegrams No. 45 and 46 of this date.2. The important initiative which was taken by your Government in proposing commercial policy discussions in 1943 has not yet produced results which we regard as encouraging. With the passage of time the objectives have tended to become more limited, and the target date for their implementationdeferred. I feel that, unless some way is found of giving these discussions a new and constructive turn, we shall move into types of trade arrangements after thewar which are based exclusively on short-run considerations of expediency ornecessity, and which store up economic trouble for the future.3. The main danger I have in mind is the breaking up of the world.intoeconomic blocs which trade,more or less freely among themselves, but discriminate against outsiders. My colleagues and I have been greatly disturbed by whatappears to us to be a hardening of influential opinion in the United Kingdomagainst British participation in a co-operative effort to remove obstacles toexpanding world trade generally, and in favour of bilateral deals, and a formof sterling area isolationism.4. I know that the international financial position of the United kingdom has^ been seriously impaired as a result of the war, and that countries in theposition of Canada and the United States would not be justified in complainingat discrimination if they were unwilling to aid in the solution of your temporarypayments difficulties, &quot;if, however, these problems were dealt with through[29368] B
concerted action along bold and imaginative lines, the path would be clearedfor real progress in the general field of commercial policy. On the other band,I am certain that restrictive measures adopted immediately after the war would set the pattern for the foreseeable future.5. Our own economic interest is, of course, vitally involved in a high levelof world trade on a non-discriminatory basis. I am, however, equally concerned at the&apos; political consequences, particularly on relations between the UnitedKingdom on the one hand and Canada and the United States on the other, of developments along the line indicated in paragraph 2. More precisely, I feelcertain that, if the United Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area went infor a policy of discrimination against imports from North America immediatelyafter the war without this course being absolutely inescapable, the general reaction in North America would be one of bitter recrimination and disillusionment. the atmosphere would undoubtedly strengthen the hands of those who are opposedto whole-hearted participation in world affairs.6. I have no doubt that political developments of this character are preciselythose which you would most wish to avoid. My main object in cabling is to letyou know that, in my view, we are drifting in this direction, and that there isneed of positive action at a high level, and at an early date if the situation is notto deteriorate beyond repair.ANNEX II.Telegram No. 45 from Canada to the Dominions Office, dated 23rd February, 1945.1. The Canadian Government has considered at length the substantialrequirements in Canada of the United Kingdom during the fiscal year 1945-46and the -request of the United Kingdom Government to receive sufficientassistance in the form of Mutual Aid or its equivalent to enable these require-ments to be obtained without the United Kingdom having to incur debt to canada during that period. The Canadian Government is prepared torecommend, to the Canadian Parliament continuation for the time being of theprovision for Mutual Aid on the scale which has been requested. Pending a parliamentary appropriation for this purpose, which may be delayed if a generalelection precedes the next session of Parliament, the Canadian Government willcontinue to place contracts and make other commitments in order to maintainthe flow of essential supplies from Canada during the early part of the nextfiscal year, in the expectation that Parliament will approve the policy which ithas been decided to recommend. Expenditures required for Mutual Aid or equivalent purposes, which cannot be covered out of the existing appropriationbefore Parliament meets again, will be provided during this period in the same manner as other expenditures for war purposes.2. In communicating this decision, the Canadian Government feels itnecessary to emphasise that Canadians have expected that Mutual Aid, togetherwith similar arrangements extended by the United States, the United Kingdomand other nations, would make it possible to finance the transfer of war suppliesbetween nations in such manner as not &apos;&apos; to burden post-war commerce, or leadto the imposition of trade restrictions, or otherwise prejudice a just andenduring peace,&quot; to use the words of the Mutual Aid Agreement between theUnited Kingdom and Canada. It is in the belief that Mutual Aid is an essentialcontribution to these ends, as well as to the winning of the war, and that throughit and other forms of collaboration these purposes can be achieved, that theCanadian Government has reached the decision concerning the provision of mutual Aid for the time being upon the scale proposed. Following the end ofhostilities in Europe, the United Kingdom&apos;s shortage of Canadian dollars and need for Mutual Aid are expected to increase in size rather than diminish, andto a degree it will assume a somewhat different complexion. During this periodMutual Aid will contribute to the prosecution of the Japanese war on a scale which should make possible some improvement in the low war-time standard ofliving in the United Kingdom and a more rapid rehabilitation of United.Kingdom export industries than would otherwise be possible. This drawsrenewed attention to the post-war implications of Mutual Aid and links thepolicy of Mutual Aid directly to the development of commercial policy.
3. In these circumstances the Canadian Government must express itsconcern over the implications of the policy being followed by the sterling area in discriminating against the purchase of Canadian products and in favour of purchases within the sterling area. The reason for this policy during the initial period of the war when conservation of dollar exchange was so vital to theUnited Kingdom, was understood. During recent years, while Lend-Lease and mutual Aid were being developed, this policy has been overshadowed by the limitations imposed by scarcities of shipping and supplies. As these limitationsrecede following the end of &apos; hostilities in Europe, the policy of restrictingpurchases from Canada more severely than purchases from the sterling area and of providing dollars to other countries in the sterling area only if they.are required for essential goods which cannot be obtained from the sterling area,is certain to result in many instances in which trade will be diverted from canada to sterling area countries. If continued, this policy will undoubtedlyset the pattern for the commercial policy of the post-war world. It is the evidentdirection of this policy, rather than the results of it up to date, which isdisquieting. It is scarcely necessary to say that neither war-time collaborationnor nearly 50 years of preferential treatment of United Kingdom exports hasprepared the Canadian public for such a development. It would be completelyat variance with the intentions of the Canadian Parliament when it took the steps within its powers to halt the growth of inter-governmental debts. NoCanadian Government could view it economically and politically, save with the gravest concern for the future of the Commonwealth.4. The limitation of sterling area purchases from Canada to essential goods which cannot be obtained anywhere in the sterling area, creating a netsystem of protection, will, particularly as new capital investment is possible, giverise to vested interests in this diverted trade, which will frustrate attempts todevelop under a code of commercial policy the wider area of world trade whichis of equal concern to the United Kingdom and to Canada.5. During the period.in which Mutual Aid is in effect Canada will bemeeting by this means substantially all of the estimated requirements from canada of the United Kingdom and the sterling area as a whole, over and above what can be paid for out of sterling area receipts from-Canada. Under conditionsof war-time shortages of shipping and supplies, even with such alleviation aswill be possible in Stage II, it is not anticipated that any large increase inCanadian exports to the sterling area would result from the termination of thepolicy of - discriminating against imports from Canada. However, it seems reasonable to assume that the United Kingdom, already burdened with (?) suchsubstantial sterling obligations, would not wish to increase these obligations byimporting from the sterling area supplies which could not be justified as importsfrom Canada. Therefore, it does not appear necessary for the United Kingdomand other sterling area countries to discriminate against imports from canadian  order to restrict total sterling area requirements from Canada to amounts which can be financed with the assistance of Mutual Aid on the scale which hasbeen proposed. If, in fact, the change in policy led to a modest increase in total requirements beyond that amount which could be met from Mutual Aid, togetherwith current receipts from Canada, it does not seem unreasonable to, expect theUnited Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area to finance such a relatively smallexcess from their own resources in view of the magnitude of Mutual Aid being provided by Canada. If the excess threatened to grow to a size that would beunmanageable, the Canadian Government would be prepared to consult with theGovernment of the United Kingdom and other authorities in the sterling arearegarding measures that might be taken to meet the situation. The UnitedKingdom Government may also be assured of the co-operation of the canadian authorities in ensuring that the most effective use is made of Canadian funds available for meeting requirements of the United Kingdom and other parts ofthe sterling area... 6. Accordingly, the Canadian Government feels that a general policy of discrimination against purchasing in Canada on the part of the United Kingdomand other countries in the sterling area is unnecessary and inappropriate. Sucha policy is inconsistent with the spirit of Mutual Aid and, if persisted in, willmake it increasingly difficult for the Canadian Government to maintain theprovision of Mutual Aid. Therefore, the Canadian Government urges theUnited Kingdom Government to follow a general policy during the period in[29368] b 2
which Mutual Aid is in effect of non-discrimination as between imports from canada and from the sterling area. It is the view of the Canadian Governmentthat this policy should apply in respect of imports purchased by individuals or authorities in other parts of the sterling area as well as in the UnitedKingdom. It is also felt that, if the United Kingdom Government or theappropriate authority in any other part of the sterling area should consider itmight be in its own interest to discriminate against public or private purchasingin Canada, for exchange reasons the Government of Uanada should be consulted before action is taken.7. It is desired to take this opportunity to express appreciation of the way in which the United Kingdom has endeavoured to maintain its exports to Canadaduring the war period despite all the difficulties that have arisen. The canadian government, on its side, has greatly reduced, and in some cases completelyremoved, tariffs on United Kingdom goods entering Canada, in order to facilitatethese exports, and has in many cases paid subsidies to enable essential goods tobe brought into Canada and sold at ceiling prices. Further means of facilitatingincreased imports from the United Kingdom, both immediately and after thewar, are under study by Canadian Government departments. Action along theselines, and even the retention of the lower tariffs already temporarily in effect,will be made difficult if Canadian exports are being excluded from the UnitedKingdom market.8. While this message has been centred primarily upon policies to befollowed before the end of hostilities, it has been intended to make evident theCanadian Governments concern over the apparent trend of developments bearingupon post-war commercial policy, particularly in the so-called transition period.A second message dealing specifically with this question of commercial policyand related financial measures in the transition period is being sent forward to-day.ANNEX III.Telegram No. 46 from Canada to the Dominions Office, dated 23rd February, 1945.Reference my immediately preceding telegram.1. The Canadian Government and people have taken a very keen interest inthe series of International Conferences which have been held over the past several years with reference to post-war economic, financial and commercial co-operationamong the nations of the world. These discussions, and the specific agreements which it is hoped will grow out of them, are of vital concern to Canada, which depends so largely upon export industries to provide domestic employment, and upon imports to maintain a high standard of living. In addition to our ownparticular interest, we are convinced that no nation in the post-war world will beable to achieve full employment, at any rate on any but a very low standard ofliving, unless international agreement can be reached on measures to achieve thefreest possible flow of world trade and the most&apos; efficient development and use ofthe world&apos;s resources.2. In these circumstances, and in the text of such agreements as have so far been reached, the special problems of the transition period immediately after theend of hostilities are recognised, at least to the extent of postponing or suspending the operation of certain clauses until rehabilitation and reconstruction have been largely achieved. The Canadian Government feel that this negative attitude tothe international problems of the transition period is insufficient, and that,positive constructive measures must be taken in order that the countries most directly concerned may surmount the special difficulties of this period as quickly as possible. We believe it is of the utmost importance that such difficulties shouldnot be permitted to result in a narrow restrictive commercial policy which would,both in the immediate post-war years and for an indefinite period thereafter,frustrate the attempt to re-establish international trade under freer conditions and in larger volume than before the war. We realise that the basic reason forany such undesirable development would be financial necessity, and, in the courseof this communication, we shall develop certain proposals designed to overcome the financial difficulty, at least as regards trade between Canada and the sterling area.
3. It is clear that to restore her industry, and re-establish her position as agreat trading nation, as well as to raise the standard of living of her peoplesubstantially above the level to which it has been reduced in wartime, will beimpossible for the United Kingdom except with the assistance of a very highvolume of imports during the immediate post-war years. Conversely, canada would be faced with extraordinary problems of readjustment and reduced activityif she were not able to maintain a high volume of exports during this period. Alarge portion of such exports would be expected to go to the United Kingdom and* other parts of the sterling area. We realise, however, that the United kingdom will not be able to pay for all of such imports during the period when her exports have not fully recovered from war-time restrictions and dislocations, exceptthrough the medium of international loans. Even for the bare minimum of themost essential requirements, the United Kingdom will have during this periodan adverse balance of trade and a deficiency of current supplies of foreign exchange with which to pay exporters in other countries. Consideration of theamount of credit which will be required, and of the nature and terms of repay-ment, seems to us to stand in the forefront of the whole problem of the transition period.4. The Canadian Government realise that the United Kingdom Governmentwill be anxious to restrict its overseas borrowing after the war to an amountwithin its capacity to pay, but it would be most undesirable for all concernedif this were taken to mean that the United Kingdom had to confine itself strictlyto an &quot; austerity &quot; level of imports at a time when it is quite possible thatabundant surplus supplies of food, raw materials and manufactured goods will .be available from North America and other exporting areas. Such an approach would unnecessarily hamper economic recovery in the United Kingdom, andcontribute to economic disorder throughout the world. Nor would it be desirable for the United Kingdom Government to seek merely to obtain loans of the conventional type, with rigid repayment features under which, in adversecircumstances, technical default might occur for reasons entirely beyond thecontrol of the United Kingdom. Loans of this character, presumably restricted to comparatively small amounts, would not meet the real needs of the transition period. On the other hand; much larger loans, adequate to facilitate a more rapid and successful revival and expansion of peace-time trade and employment,would be well within the ultimate capacity of the United Kingdom to repay ifthe terms of repayment were sufficiently realistic and flexible, and recognised the dependence of such international debt payments on conditions ^of expandingworld trade, and ample markets for United Kingdom exports. Loans of this character, indeed, would themselves aid in creating the very conditions uponwhich their ultimate liquidation depends, and by encouraging an expansiveattitude to international trade, both in the transition period and subsequently,would strengthen borrower and lender alike, and assist in the attainment of highemployment, and in the development of liberal commercial policy throughout theworld.5. In pursuance of these objectives, the Canadian Government would beprepared to discuss ways and means of financing Canada&apos;s prospective surplusof exports to the United Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area over its importsfrom that area during the transition period immediately following the termina-tion of hostilities against Germany and Japan, in such manner as to encourage the largest possible flow of trade in both directions, and remove any necessitiesfor discrimination against the goods of either area in the markets of the other.Under the plans we have in mind, Canadian dollars would be provided tothe sterling area for expenditure in Canada over a period of several years by along-term credit, which would be repayable by annual instalments commencing,say, 10 years after the termination of the transition period. The terms of the credit would recognise that such repayment in Canadian dollars, or in gold or united States dollars in lieu of Canadian dollars, depends upon the making of purchases of goods and services from the United Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area by Canada and other countries outside the sterling area. If in any year sufficient foreign exchange or debt repayment were not available to theUnited Kingdom from such sources, and from its reserves of gold and dollars overand above its minimum requirements for working balances and reserve foremergencies, such inability to pay for reasons beyond the control of the UnitedKingdom would automatically cause the payment due in that year to be post-poned without the United Kingdom being considered in any way in default until such time as payment could be effected in the manner contemplated.
/ 6. The adoption of such terms of repayment of the proposed credit would,,we feel, constitute a realistic approach to an otherwise most difficult situation,and would base the financial arrangements on those conditions of world trade ingeneral, and of trade between the sterling area and Canada in particular, uponwhich they necessarily and in fact depend. We believe that agreement on thesematters could readily be reached so as to put our post-war commercial relations on a firm and satisfactory basis, and so as to remove any need for the UnitedKingdom or other parts of the sterling area to feel that they have to discriminate .against imports from Canada in favour of imports from within the sterling areaitself, or from any other part of the world. Similarly, Canada would expect to obtain imports from the United Kingdom and the sterling area on a non-discriminatory basis, and in increasing volume as supplies in such countriesbecame available in the course of rehabilitation of their export industries.7. We should like to commence discussions directly\ with you at an earlydate. In addition, however, we realise that it would be of the greatest importance to our own two countries, and to the world as a whole, if the UnitedStates were willing to enter into arrangements of a more or less similar character,and we should be glad to collaborate on this wider basis in the event of discussions to this end being held between the Governments of the United&apos;Kingdom and theUnited States.ANNEX IV.Personal telegram No. 249/5 from the Prime Minister to the Prime Ministerof Canada.1. I am very grateful to you for your telegrams 45, 46 and 47 whosehelpful and constructive proposals are receiving the closest study.2. Naturally, with so many military and political questions requiring urgentdecision, I find it difficult to devote as much time as I should like to the problemsof post-war commercial policy. Our officials have, however, been giving con-tinuous study to these matters, and we shall shortly be sending you some of theresults. I shall do everything in my power to ensure that progress on these important matters is not unduly delayed. I can certainly assure you now thatwe for our part shall give the fullest weight to Canada&apos;s wishes and interests,and will make every effort to come to an arrangement satisfactory to your country,which has contributed so much to the common cause.3. We are particularly grateful for your financial proposals which are mostgenerous, and a promising starting point for our future discussions. I cannot,of course, say anything definite without the fullest consultation with the Chan-cellor, who is not in London at the moment. But I can assure you that I ammost sensible of the generous and friendly spirit which inspires your suggestion.4. Meanwhile, I should like to say at once what a comfort it is to have yourdecision to see us through on Stage II. Canada has been a tower of strength tous throughout, but this does not lessen my gratitude for this fresh example ofthe helpful spirit in which you face the common problem.(Initialled) W. S. C.3.3.45.
