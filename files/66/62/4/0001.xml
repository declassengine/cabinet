ii  aTHIS DOCUMENT IS.THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET. Copy No.-W.P. (45) 99.lQth February, 1945,WAR CABINET.WORLD ORGANISATION IN RELATION TO THE DOMINIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.FOLLOWING upon the conclusions of the War Cabinet on the 11th J anuary(W.M. (45) 4th Conclusions, paragraph 4 (4)), arrangements have been madefor the officials of the departments concerned to meet and examine the detailedsuggestions made by the Dominion Governments in-relation to the DumbartonOaks proposals and to report to the Armistice and Post-war Committee.There is, however, one point to which I think I should draw the attentionof the War Cabinet immediately, namely, the question of arrangements for a&quot;British Commonwealth meeting in advance&apos;of the World Conference. Such ameeting was approved in principle by the War Cabinet on the 11th january and the Dominion Governments would also welcome it. It now remains,therefore, to settle the level of the meeting and its date and place.As regards the level of the meeting, there would obviously be considerable advantages in having it on the highest practicable level so as to facilitate thereaching of definite conclusions. This would point to a meeting on the ministerial level and I should guess that this would be welcome to Australiaand New Zealand since no doubt Dr. Evatt himself from, Australia, and probablyMr. Nash from New Zealand would wish to attend. It may, however, be difficult for Canada and South Africa to arrange for the attendance of Ministers at sucha meeting. Moreover, information which I have received leads me to thinkthat Mr. Mackenzie King would piefer a meeting on the official level. I see no reason, however, to suppose that he would object to other Dominions beingrepresented by Ministers, if that were more convenient to them, so long asCanada&apos;s right to be represented by an official was safeguarded.- As regards the place, I suggest we should try to arrange the meeting inLondon. I understand that this would be preferred by Canada and I do notimagine that the others would be likely to make difficulties.As regards the date of the meeting,. I suggest that we should aim at as early a date as practicable so as to give time for the results of the discussions,at the meeting to be considered by the Governments in advance of the opening ofthe International Conference on the 25th April. From this point of view thebest date would, I suggest, be about the 15th March, which would enable themeeting to be concluded before Easter (1st April).I should be glad, therefore, to have the authority of the War Cabinet to propose fo the Dominion Governments at once the arrangement of a Common-wealth Meeting in London on or about the 15th March on the Ministerial level,on the understanding that, if any Government finds it impracticable to send a Minister, it could be represented by appropriate officials (including, of course,High Commissioners or diplomatic representatives).There is one further point. It is of vital importance that we should go into the proposed Commonwealth Meeting- without any commitment which would prevent us from accepting and. agreeing to support,  at the International[29236]
Conference, any suggestion for amendment of the Dumbarton Oaks proposalswhich may be agreed as a result of the Commonwealth Meeting. I gather thatthe effect of the agreement reached at the Crimea Conference is that theDumbarton Oaks proposals, as completed by the voting compromise, are to beput forward as a basis for discussion at the International Conference and thatthis is the full extent of our commitment. This is entirely satisfactory from theDominion point of view and I hope that care will be taken to avoid&apos; implying,in any public statement, that our commitments go deeper.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,16th February, 1945.
