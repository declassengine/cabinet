THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 109.28th February, 1945.WAR CABINET.WORLD FOOD SUPPLIES, 1945.Memorandum by. the Minister of Food.THE year 1945 will be a critical year for the world in food. Of the chieffoods only wheat will be available in abundance. Meat, canned fish, fats, sugar and dairy produce (butter, cheese, canned milk and milk powder) will, in face ofincreasing demands, be in shorter supply than ever before.2. The production of meat, lard and other fats in North America willbe lower in 1945 than in 1944. The drought in Australia, South Africa and theArgentine has reduced supplies of meat and dairy produce and has made itnecessary to ship wheat over abnormally long distances to countries usuallydependent upon Australia.3. Shortage of shipping is restricting the delivery of fertilisers to pro-ducing countries. The continuance of the war is denying to food production the man-power it needs.  No increase in production is yet in sight.4. The requirements of liberated countries are growing and there are many factors hampering a rapid recovery of agriculture on the Continent.5. Demands from the Services, both our own and those of the United States,continue to grow.6. If the civilian populations of the United Nations (excluding allcountries on the European continent) were to eat no more in 1945 than theydid in 1944 their requirements would exceed world production of all the majorfoods except wheat.7. I had hoped to be in a position to celebrate the end of the European warwith some increase in rations, e.g., an extra 2d. per week on meat, certain bonusissues of sugar, extra fats. These are now quite impossible. Moreover, I amhaving to reduce my stocks to the minimum level. Some may even fall below that figure.8. The Combined Food Board is at present endeavouring to divide up theavailable supplies fairly. All countries are having to make sacrifices. We arereducing our stocks and renouncing, for the present, our hopes of improving ourdiet. The United States is reluctantly and painfully cutting down consumption.Liberated countries will receive less than they had hoped.9. In the case of meat the position is serious. Reduced production hadalready compelled the United States to restore most meats to points rationingthereby cutting civilian consumption by 1,000,000 tons from the exceptionally high 1944 level. Even after this there remains a deficit between world require-,ments and supplies of 1,800,000 tons, of which some 500,000 tons may be met from stocks. Further cuts must still be made; but I do not intend to agreeto a reduction in our present meagre ration, although part of it may have to bemet for a time in the form of canned corned beef. Our contribution will be togive up some of our reserves. Tentative proposals being considered by the combined Food Board would result in bringing down United States civilian* consumption from 155 lbs. in 1944 to 124 lbs. per head while we remain at about117 lbs. per.head.[29287], B
10. The production of canned fish for 1944-45 was 373,000 tonsagainst requirements of 496,000 tons. The deficit is being met by heavy stockreductions, bringing reserves to minimum levels. Production in 1945-46 will again fall short of demand, so that reductions in consumption after July 1945are inevitable.11.. The deficit between requirements and supply of oils and fats for 1945exceeds 1,000,000 tons. To meet this we are reducing our stocks by 250,000 tons;the United States is also reducing stocks and is planning appreciable cuts inits consumption of edible and non-edible fats (including soap).12. The position of sugar is particularly disquieting. On the basis of current civilian and Services requirements supply will fall short of demand by over 1,500,000 tons. The United States is prepared to reduce its civilian con-sumption. The figure is not yet settled. We, while maintaining our ration,^ arecutting our stocks to the minimum.13. Final figures for dairy produce are not yet available. It is alreadyabundantly clear that I shall be able to maintain the butter and cheese rationsonly with difficulty, and in the case of the latter shall have to reduce it to 2-ozs.per week for the summer six months as I reluctantly did last year.14. While the United States are prepared to make fairly substantial cutsin their standards of civilian consumption, they will still be eating more food and much greater varieties of food than we shall. Canada and the southern dominions, in spite of the restrictions they have imposed, -also enjoy a higher standard of diet than we do. If the world&apos;s food&apos;budgets are to balance, theexisting deficits can only be removed by still further cuts in consumption in producing countries, mainly the United States;15. A special aspect of the position in 1945 is the largely increased demandfor food from the Services both British and United States. So far as can be judged, procurement by the War Department of the United States is out ofall proportion to ration requirements and must mean that they are building upheavy stocks.16. Bad as the supply position is in 1945, I can see no prospect of much, ifany, improvement in 1946. As will be apparent from what I have said in thismemorandum, our consumption level in many commodities will be maintainedthis year by eating into our stocks. We obviously can only do this once. Theprospects of obtaining from overseas additional supplies in 1946 are small.The only hope is that the requirements of the Allied Fighting Services may be greatly reduced.17. It is important that there should be no fall in food production in theUnited Kingdom either in 1945 or in 1946. Only if the British public realise the facts will it be possible to persuade farmers of the continuing urgency of ourdemands upon them; only so will it be possible to avoid disappointment on thepart of consumers that rations are not increased when the German war is over.18. I thought it right to bring the very difficult food situation to the noticeof my colleagues and perhaps some of them may have the opportunity of referring to the position in any speeches they may be making.19. I attach a series of statistical appendices giving the latest availableestimates for the scarce foods.J. J. LI.Ministry of Food,28th February, 1945.

On the other hand, the position may be improved bythe resumption of shipments from the Philippines.
