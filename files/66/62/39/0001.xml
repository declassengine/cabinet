THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.Copy No.WAR CABINET.TRANSPORT  SITUATION IN FRANCE.Memorandum by the Minister of Production, the Minister of war transport and the Minister of State.1.   At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 5th February, 1945 (W.M. (45)14th Conclusions, Minute 4), we were invited to prepare, in consultation withthe Chiefs of Staff, and to submit to the War Cabinet, a combined report on the.internal transport situation in France.The report which follows summarises the action &quot;taken or proposed to betaken to improve the situation, and has been agreed with the Chiefs of Staff.2. Locomotives.(a) Dispatches to France from United Kingdom since D-Day.Out of the large number of locomotives sent to France 650 were taken fromrailway operation in the United Kingdom, and a further 200 are due to go inFebruary and March.The loss of these 850 locomotives severely strains the United Kingdom system and it is impossible to release more. Although these locomotives are assigned toS.H.A.E.F. and not to the French authorities, they are directly (see (&amp;) below)or indirectly of assistance to- the French Government and they reduce the number which would otherwise have to be withdrawn from French railways for military purposes.(b) Use of the S.H.A.E.F. pool of Locomotives for Civil needs.S.H.A.E.F. are helping to the fullest extent consistent with military needs in assisting civil traffic by temporary loans from the S.H.A.E.F. pool for Frenchcivilian purposes. It is of the utmost importance that such assistance is continuedas far as possible.(c) Repairs.The French have repaired 4,000 of their own locomotives a considerableachievement in the time but the rate is falling because of early concentration on less damaged locomotives and the growing shortage of components and tools.British experts are now conferring with French on their requirements of rawmaterials, components, machinery and tools, and the roofing of repair shops andengine sheds, much of which it is hoped to supply from the United Kingdom.(d) New Locomotives from United States.700 new. locomotives have been allocated for France from United Statesproduction in 1945 and 1946. These should be coming off the lines by september and 422 should have been completed by the end of 1945.3. Railway Waggons.New Construction.(a) We are arranging to divert the balance (some 3,000) of an M.W.T. order for British-type wagons to France if acceptable. These should be available for shipment during the next few weeks.[29348] &apos;SECRET.W.P. (45) 134.5th March, 1945.
(6) We are also endeavouring to arrange for 7,000 new wagons to be built in United Kingdom with French braking system, couplings, &amp;c. These shouldbe completed in the latter part of this year and will not prejudice the already planned production of 20,000 wagons for home railways (being 17,000 fromrailway workshops and 3,000 from private shops, exclusive of the 3,000 under(a) above&apos;and those programmed for the Empire and elsewhere).. (c) -Out of 75,000 included in the French national import programme, 22,000from United States and 6,000 from Canada have already been allocated, subjectto acceptance of standard United States cast-iron wheels. No information asto delivery dates is yet available.Used Stock.(d) In early spring, when pressure on home railways is relaxed, we proposethat 10,000 of our existing wagons (approximately 1,250,000) be sent toFrance, assuming that we dan be satisfied that the French can make good and full use of this number as well as the 3,000 under (a) above. If they cannot souse the whole 13,000 then we would supply them with as many within that totalas they can use. These wagons would have to be operated on shuttle service as they are not interchangeable with French rolling stock.The Minister of War Transport has stipulated that he must have definiteassurances that such second-hand wagons as are now made available to the french should be replaced by additional wagons for the British railways in time for next winter&apos;s work (over and above any improvement which may be secured inthe rate of repairs in the United Kingdom).Repairs.(e) To assist French repair organisations, after consultation between techni-cal specialists of both countries, components, tools and raw material will beprovided from United Kingdom.  Advantages of this method are : (i) For given number of wagons less shipping space wanted and(ii) &quot;French labour is used.(iii) Assistance can begin to flow quickly.(iv) Repair of urgently needed covered wagons will be hastened.Beyond a certain point, increased provision for repair components would be atexpense of (&amp;) above.Wagon Sheets.(/) We aim to provide raw material (cotton or flax) for manufacture inFrance.  There is a general shortage of these sheets.4. Tugs for inland water transport.45 asked for by the French. S.H.A.E.F. has provided 15 and promised15 more within month. Some may b.e obtained from United Kingdom but weare short.   The possibility of using Minca barges is being examined.5. A ncillary equipment.(a) Reserve bridging material held in United Kingdom against air-raid damage was offered to French in October 1944. - 4,100 tons have now been calledforward by S.H.A.E.F.(b) Some cranes have already been released to civil government fromS.H.A.E.F. military stocks. More are available in United Kingdom from stocksheld by Office of Works; allocation is under consideration.&quot;(c) Machine and hand tools will be made available when French urgent needs for transportation are defined. It is expected that we can find most of what isessential.6. Road Transport.New Vehicles from United Kingdom.(a) We propose to send as soon as possible 200 commercial 5-ton lorries and300 commercial 5-ton tipping vehicles; and within the next six months, 3,000commercial 5-ton lorries.Used Vehicles.(b) Reconditioned Army lorries suitable for civil use are being made availablefor Civil Affairs at the rate of 200 a week rising shortly to 350 and possiblylater to 750. A large proportion of these will go to France.
(c) Later, repairable vehicles will be given &apos;&apos; first-aid &apos;&apos; repairs and madeavailable for transport to France for reconditioning there. Because of thelimitation of shipping first attention is given to reconditioned vehicles.Until S.H.A.E.F. demands are fulfilled, except for urgent special needs, allother claims are being deferred. Thereafter, supplies will be shared by claimants,France taking her share having regard to relative urgency and shipping avail-ability.The above is irrespective of the French share of new production of vehicles in United States and Canada. This depends upon allocation by Combined boards in Washington and shipping availabilities.(d) If acceptable to the French, and if suitable arrangements can be madefor the drivers, one or more units of the M.W.T. Road Haulage Organisationcan be sent to France.7. Cross-Channel Shipping and French River Traffic, e.g., Seine and Oise.The shipment to France of the material referred to in the preceding para-graphs will not present any unsurmountable difficulty provided that the ships and craft at present employed are not diverted to other uses. Six of these craftare American rail-fitted L.S.T.&apos;s the removal of which would seriously reducethe rabe at which railway wagons from, the United Kingdom could be delivered to France.The possibilities of using L.C.T.&apos;s which the Admiralty can now release arebeing examined.O. L.L.R. K. L.5th March, 1945.
