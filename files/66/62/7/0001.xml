R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,17 th February, 1945.Joint Memorandum by Foreign Office and Special Operations Executive.On the 9th September, 1944, the Foreign Secretary circulated a memorandum to the War Cabinet (W.P. (44) 514) regarding certain operations proposed byS.O.E., involving infiltration into Siam and contact with the Siamese Regent,Luang Pradit. The Foreign Secretary made it clear that if political considera-tions alone had been at stake he would have advised against this contact. Butit had been urged by Admiral Mountbatten on grounds of military necessity which.the Foreign Secretary felt it difficult to over-rule. He therefore proposed thatS.O.E. should be authorised to proceed with their plans, provided that they made it clear beyond all possibility of misunderstanding in any dealings withthe Siamese (a) that our only interest at present was the defeat of Japan and, so faras Siam was concerned, the expulsion of the Japanese from Siameseterritory, and(&amp;) that no political commitment whatever was involved as regards theultimate regime and organisation of Siam.2. The War Cabinet took a decision in this sense on the 25th September,1944 (W.M. (44) 127th Conclusions, Minute 6). A S.O.E. party is in Siam and,through its medium, messages have been exchanged between Luang Pradit andthe S.O.E. organisation at South-East Asia Command Headquarters.3. Luang Pradit has been urged to send out a military representativecapable of discussing plans for action against the Japanese in Siam. He has nowannounced his intention of sending out a mission consisting of four persons, ofwhom the most important are an un-named General, who is said to be the Chief ofthe Siamese General Staff designate, and Nai Direk Jainam, who was Minister forForeign Affairs at the time of the outbreak of war with Japan. Provisionalarrangements have been made to exfiltrate this party by air from Siam on or about12668   [29242] b
2the 20th February. For physical reasons connected with flying conditions andalso in order to diminish the chances of their absence being detected, the party will have to return to Siam&apos; within approximately six days after reaching India.4. The decision to include Nai Direk is contrary to the advice originallygiven by S.O.E. to Luang Pradit and seems to foreshadow an attempt to raise&apos;political issues under the cover of military conversations. Luang Pradit has alsorequested that arrangements should be made for the mission to meet M. SeniPremoj, the Siamese Minister in Washington, and a member of his staff namedSanasen. As both these gentlemen are in the United States this would meanspecial arrangements for bringing them urgently to India.;5. Although it would be possible to refuse to receive a political emissary atthis stage, we have felt that it would be impolitic to do so, more especially since,in that case, it is quite probable that Nai&quot; Direk would be brought out under the auspices of the American Office of Strategic Services, which is also operating in Siam. But instructions are required as to the handling of this mission, andmore particularly as to what is to be said to Nai Direk should he attempt to raisepolitical issues.6. This question has to be considered in the light of the following develop-ments elsewhere.7. On the 14th January a secret mission sent by the Siamese Regentarrived in Chungking, and has since been engaged in conversations with theChinese Government. Although the la,tter informed ourselves and the UnitedStates Government beforehand of the impending arrival of this mission we have as yet received no information as to the points which it has raised. In response to a caveat which we entered as soon as we heard of the mission, the Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Chungkingon the 12th January that the Chinese Government had no intention of committing themselves to anything without previous consultation with the Allies. -8. The other development is that O.S.S.. have recently brought out fromSiam a Siamese named Suni, and have taken him to Washington to see theSiamese Minister in Washington, for whom he has a message from Luang Praditwhich he refuses to divulge to anyone else. The State Department have informed his Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington of their encouragement of Suni, andhave said that they would listen to what the Siamese had to say and then consultus. Suni himself stated to a member of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington,on the 12th February, that he constitutes one of three &quot;parallel missions &quot; sent out by Luang Pradit, the others being the one which has already arrived inChungking, and the one which is about to arrive in Kandy.9. By conducting separate conversations in three different places in thisway with the three Powers principally concerned with Siam, Pradit is obviouslyin an excellent position to play off these Powers one against another, and it is un-fortunately the case that the angle of approach of the three Powrers is not the same,,and that there is thus room for divergence between them. The Siamese Govern -ment declared war on Great Britain and the United States on the 25th January,1942. They have never done so against China.. Nor has China ever declared war on Siam. Furthermore, although His Majesty&apos;s Government announced astate of war with Siam existed as from the date of the Siamese declaration, andNew Zealand, the Union of South Africa and Australia followed suit, the UnitedStates Government do not recognise the existence&apos; of a state of Avar and regardSiam merely as enemy-occupied territory. The importance of this technicaldifference should not, of course, be exaggerated. There is no reason to suppose that it would prevent the United States or China from treating as enemies anySiamese troops found actively co-operating with the Japanese. But it has acertain propaganda value, and may give the United States and China an advantage in dealing with Siam.10. Moreover, as the War Cabinet will remember, both Chiang Kai-Shekand President Roosevelt made public declanations in 1943 sympathetic to Siam.The Americans believe that they consequently enjoy a reservoir of good-will inthat country and may believe further that they can turn it into channels ofpolitical and military advantage. His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part havetaken no action similar to that of the Americans and Chinese as they were notprepared to issue a declaration in such favourable terms.
11. Recently correspondence took place between the Foreign secretary and the United States Ambassador regarding the respective attitudes of ourselves and the United States towards Siam, and for convenience of reference a copyof this correspondence and of a memorandum explaining the developments which led up to it are attached as an Annex. The divergence is perhaps notfundamental. We are no doubt as willing as the United States to see the eventualrestoration of a free, sovereign and independent Siam. But our approach to theproblem is necessarily different. For us it is a concrete and not an abstractproblem. The contiguity of Siam with Burma and Malaya gives us a very closematerial interest. Moreover, whatever sympathy we may feel with the Siamesepeople on account of old friendship and their comparative helplessness underJapanese occupation, the Siamese Government which preceded the present government did us certain injuries. For instance their ill-judged policy, towardsIndo-China in 1940 and 1941 helped to open the backdoor to Singapore; and notonly did they despite the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of Non-Aggress ion enter into an active allliance with Japan (albeit perhaps under duress) after the Japaneseinvasion of Siam and. declare war upon us; but also at a later stage they accepted, at the hands of Japan, territories belonging to Burma and Malaya.12. Redress for these injuries must presumably precede reconciliation andthe further question arises (and is at present under examination by the Chiefs ofStaff) whether special strategic arrangements will not have to be imposed onSiam within the framework of an international system in the interests of security.13. Thus, while we understand that Luang Pradit has always taken a somewhat independent line vis-a-vis the Japanese and we believe him to be working genuinely for co-Operation with the Allies within the limits of what is practicable under Japanese occupation, we are clearly not in a position to makeunrestricted promises about the future of Siam; and if any detailed statement could be made consistently with the principle of &quot;unconditional surrender,&quot; itwould have to be agreed with our co-belligerent Dominions.14. At the same time, it is against our interests to leave the field to the americans and the Chinese by remaining completely and indefinitely silent about our- general attitude towards Siam.15. Such is the background for the decision now required as to the handling of the Siamese Mission of which Nai Direk is to be a member.16. The Mission is going to see Admiral Mountbatten. In view of themissions sent to Chungking and Washington it would, we feel, be over-punctiliouson our part to assume that Admiral Mountbatten is being approached in his capacity as Supreme Allied Commander rather than as the highest british military authority in the area and that we must therefore consult the Americansbefore sending instructions to him. We suggest nevertheless that, despite the probability that the Americans know about the Mission through their representa-tives in South-East Asia Command, it would be advisable to inform the UnitedStates Government of the impending arrival of the Mission and of the instruc-tions which we are sending to Admiral Mountbatten. PHm-a facie a similarcommunication ought to be made to the Chinese. The members of the SiameseMission are, however, running a considerable personal risk and Chinese insecurityis notorious. We feel, therefore, that while His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atChungking should be personally informed of the position, the question of a communication to the Chinese Government should be deferred, subject to hisobservations, until the Mission has returned to Siam.17. We suggest that Admiral Mountbatten should be instructed to confinehimself as Supreme Allied Commander to the discussion of purely, military matters affecting operations against the Japanese. If any attempt is made on theSiamese side, to raise political issues he should decline to discuss such issues,saying that he can only report what is said by the Siamese Mission on any politicalmatter for the consideration of the Allied Governments. &apos;18. At the same time Admiral Mountbatten might be instructed to take anopportunity at his discretion, either personally or through the British PoliticalAdviser attached to his Headquarters, to speak to Nai Direk on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the lines of the following formula : 1&quot; It is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to see the restoration ofa free, sovereign and independent Siam and a renewal of the old friendlvrelations between Great Britain and Siam.   But the road to be trodden[29242] b 2
before this goal is reached is not a smooth one. Much will depend on themeasures which Siam takes to contribute towards the expulsion of theJapanese from Siamese territory and towards the ultimate defeat of Japan;and on her readiness (a) to make good to His Majesty&apos;s Government and their allies the damage done to them in consequence of Siam&apos;s association with japan, and (b) to ensure security and good-neighbourly relations for thefuture. For the time being His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s interest is concen-trated upon the expulsion of the Japanese. Any proposals going beyond this which the Mission may have to make will of course be reported to HisMajesty&apos;s Government for consideration but cannot be discussed with thepresent Mission in the absence of express instructions from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment..&quot; .If this is approved it is suggested that it should be communicated to the UnitedStates Government together with the substance of paragraph 17 above.19. Luang Pradit&apos;s request that the Mission should be placed in touch withthe Siamese Minister in Washington and Mr. Sanasen is a somewhat difficultpoint to dispose of since we can hardly conceal it from the United States Govern-ment who may be anxious to give effect to it. Although disclaiming up to nowany intention to enter into any political commitments towards particular Siamesenationals or groups, the United States Government do pay very special attentionto the Siamese Minister in Washington and regard him as the nucleus of apossible Free Siamese Movement. Even if, as is probably the case, his ownactivities in Washington were to preclude an immediate journey to India, theUnited States Government might nevertheless be strongly in favour of a journeyby Mr. Sanasen. We feel, however, that it is in principle undesirable to facili-tate contact between Nai Direk and Siamese in the United States, particularly as Luang Pradit has sent a separate emissary there. Moreover, when mr. Sanasen was last in India he engaged in political propaganda and attempted to build himself up as a Free Siamese representative by making independentcontacts with a number of Government Agencies in spite of a previous agree-ment not to discuss Siamese politics. It is also alleged that he attempted toplay Americans and the &quot;British against each other and was an unsettling influenceamong the Free Siamese in India. We suggest therefore that we should tell theState Department of Luang Pradifs request but say that apart from the physicalpracticability of transporting the Siamese Minister or Mr. Sanasen to India intime, we see no reason for special arrangements to this effect in view of the factthat Luang Pradit has sent a separate emissary to the United States and thatwe should prefer not to give effect to this particular request. Lord Halifaxmight be authorised at his discretion to make confidential use of the aboveobjections to Mr. Sariasen.20. If the War Cabinet authorises action in the sense of paragraphs 16, 17,18 and 19 above, it is suggested that the Dominion Prime Ministers should be advised accordingly for their most secret and personal information.Foreign Office, S. W. 1, lQth February, 1945.ANNEX.[F 5781/23/G](1)Mr. Winant to Mr. Eden.(Secret.) .    Embassy of the United States of America,Dear Mr. Eden, London, W. 1, l%th August, 1944.YOU will recall that on the 26th February, 1944, Sir George Sansom, british minister at, Washington, transmitted to the Department of State a copy of &amp;declaration which the British Government proposed to make in regard toThailand to the effect that Thailand had &quot; betrayed &quot; its friendship with Great-Britain, had collaborated with the enemy, had declared war and that the Thai
people would have to &quot; work their passage home.&quot; On the 20th March, 1944, astatement regarding the United States attitude towards Thailand was handed toLord Halifax in Washington, with the comment that the proposed British state-ment was &apos;&apos; rather rough &apos;&apos; and that it might be misunderstood, as it failed to give any intimation that Thailand would be continued as an independent Power. Inthe months that followed there have been frequent discussions between officers ofthe British Embassy and of the Department of State, but on the 31st July, 1944,-these conversations were brought to a pause by a statement from the british embassy to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government does not believe that any useful purpose could be served by the issuance at this time of a statement withrespect to Thailand on the terms proposed.I am informed that several months ago officers of the State Department raised the question with the British Embassy in Washington as to whether the BritishGovernment had given consideration to the policy of communicating to the UnitedStates Government a confidential statement of British policy toward Thailand.On the 31st July the Embassy indicated that the matter of the confidential state-ment would be taken up-with the Foreign Office by airmail.My Government would view with extreme regret the inability of the UnitedKingdom and the United States to take an identical position with regard to problems which involve the long-term objectives for which this war is beingfought. However, if the British Government is reluctant, because of considera-tions involving the security or integrity of any British territory, to give theundertaking desired for the confidential information of the United StatesGovernment, it would hardly be necessary to remind the British Government thatany such undertaking, if given at this time, would in no way prejudice the rightof the British Government to present any such problem of territorial security orintegrity to the United Nations for such consideration and action as they might consider desirable and helpful to British interests.The absence of a statement of British intentions with respect to Thailandis causing considerable inconvenience to my Government -in that it delays decisionon- important cognate matters relating to Thailand and Indo-China. I should therefore greatly appreciate any statement you may be able to make to me- in thisrespect for communication to my Government.- Sincerely,JOHN G. WINANT.[F .3857/23/G] (2)Mr. Eden to Mr. Winant.(Secret.) Foreign Office, 4th September, 1944.I WELCOME your secret letter of the 18th August as giving me theopportunity for a much-needed clearing of the air in regard to our respectiveattitudes towards Siam.Frankly, we were very disappointed at the reception by the state department of our honest attempt to show that we were no less favourable thanthe United States and China to the idea of a free and independent Siam afterthe war. Nothing could have been more definite in its discouragement of ourattempt than the first paragraph of the statement handed to Lord Halifax on the20th March and, incidentally, the remark that our proposed declaration would&apos;&apos; augment&apos;&apos; distrust of our intentions produced, if I may say so, an unfortunateimpression here.If you will consult the statement of the 20th March again I think you will agree that the burden of the criticism was not, as suggested in paragraph 1 ofyour letter, that our declaration failed to give any intimation that Siam wouldbe continued as an independent Power (a point dealt with, in fact, ,in the last sentence of our draft declaration). The criticism appeared to be rather that thedeclaration did not include an &apos;&apos; unequivocal commitment&apos;&apos; that Great britain had no territorial ambitions in Siam, and the suggestion was made that thisomission should be remedied in any declaration on our part. This suggestion was an invitation to go further than the United States Government had themselvesgone in their proposed declaration, which was silent on the territorial point.Moreover, it implied the existence of a doubt on a matter already covered by thiscountry&apos;s undertakings in the Atlantic Charter and the Cairo Declaration.
I am relieved to see that your present letter offers a different and more hopefulapproach to the subject, and I am happy to take advantage of it.Our two Governments have, I think, the same basic objects as regards Siam.We, like the United States, want to see the restoration of Siam after the war asa free, sovereign and independent State, subject only to its acceptance of suchspecial arrangements for security or economic collaboration as may be judgednecessary within an international system. Before this stage is reached we haveto drive out the Japanese, and to this end we wish, as do the United States, to.encourage the Siamese themselves to create the maximum difficulties for the JJapanese and thus to make the maximum contribution to their own liberation.But at present we and the United States Government have not got our ideasco-ordinated and, if we are to get this problem straightened out, it is essential thatwe should recognise that we necessarily view it from --somewhat different angles.The United States Government do not regard themselves as being at war withSiam. His Majesty&apos;s Government do. Moreover, while appreciating the possible advantages of Siam&apos;s resistance to the Japanese, His Majesty&apos;s Government donot rate its practical value very high and feel that it is in any case of doubtfulwisdom to encourage the comfortable view that the Siamese can count on an easyand assured future regardless of their attitude towards the Japanese and theefforts which they make to help themselves and us. We feel, in fact, that ifresistance is to be encouraged it may need a spur rather than a sugar-plum.Again, we are bound to consider the effect upon neighbouring territories ofany public declaration about Siam, and it is here that any reference to territorial integrity presents difficulties. As declared at Cairo, &quot;we have no thought of territorial expansion.&quot; But it goes without saying that Siam cannot be allowedto.keep the ill-gotten gains which she has accepted from her Japanese ally at theexpense of Malaya, of Burma and of French Indo-China. Some special strategicarrangements may also be necessary in the Kra Isthmus within the framework of an international security system. I am glad to note the. assurance in your letterthat our right to present such problems of territorial security or integrity to theUnited Nations for consideration would not be prejudiced, so far as the UnitedStates Government are concerned, by any undertaking we might now give. Butthere is a danger that any pronouncement about territorial integrity might createpopular misunderstanding unless hedged about with reservations on the particularquestions referred to above. A detailed statement, on the other hand, would belikely to have the undesirable result of encouraging premature discussion of amatter which it is our policy to leave to the peace settlement. Even in the case of allies we have refrained from any commitment about territorial integrity, andI cannot believe that the United States Government would wish to press us to treatan enemy more tenderly than an Ally.Any formal statement on Siam, whether for publication or otherwise, wouldrequire Cabinet approval and the concurrence of the Dominions. But I trust thatthis personal letter, in which I have attempted, to make our position quite clear,will serve the purpose of removing any uncertainty about our intentions. I needhardly say that J shall welcome further consultation on the whole question.Yours sincerely,ANTHONY EDEN,3[F 3857/23/G] (3)Mr. Winant to Mr. Eden.(Secret.) Embassy of the United States of.America,Dear Mr. Eden, London, W. 1, 5th September, 1944.THANK you very much for your letter of the 4th September regardingthe British attitude totwards Siam. I am communicating the contents of your letter at once to the State Department, and I am sure it will be very glad toreceive this detailed explanation of the British point of view.Sincerely,JOHN G.  WINANT.       ^*
[F 4969/23/G](4)Mr. Winant to Mr. Eden.Embassy of the United States of America,,Sir* London, W. 1, 21st October, 1944.I HAVE the honour to state that an instruction has been received from theDepartment of State which states that the Government of the United Statesdeeply appreciates the spirit of your letter to me of the 4th September On thesubject of Thailand, and your suggestion that you would welcome further consultation on this question with a view to seeking co-ordination of policy bythe British and United States Governments. While, as you suggest, our* twoGovernments view the question of Thailand from somewhat different angles, theUnited States Government believes it desirable in the highest degree that our two Governments reach&apos;, if possible, a common policy toward Thailand.The Government of the United States has noted with the utmost satisfactionthe statement in your letter : &apos;&apos; Our two Governments have, I think, the samebasic objects as regards Siam. We, like the United States, want to see therestoration of Siam after the war as a free, sovereign and independent State.&quot;However, it is apparent that there are several points which require mutualclarification before there can be that co-ordination of policy which both Govern-ments desire, and it is the belief of the Government of the United States that onthese points, and on any others which may arise, there should be as full and frankan exchange of views as possible.The United States Government has noted your feeling that it had requested the British Government to make a public declaration going beyond what theUnited States Government was prepared to do, It is desired to assure theBritish Government that this was at no time the intention of the United StatesGovernment. In discussing with the British Embassy in Washington thepossibility of a British public statement on Thailand, it had been the hope ofthe United States Government that the British Government would feel able to associate itself with the public statements already made by Generalissimo chiang kai-shek -shek and President Poosevelt favouring a free, independent and sovereignThailand and expressly disclaiming any territorial ambitions. However, in viewof the feeling expressed by the British Government on the 31st July that no useful purpose would be served by such a British statement at this time, theUnited States Government has not since pressed for any public declaration.It has, on the contrary, sought only a confidential indication of British viewsrespecting Thailand as a necessary step toward reaching a common understanding and co-ordination of the policies of the two Governments.The United States Government has also noted a possible doubt in yourmind as to its views with regard to territories acquired by Thailand while underJapanese domination. The United States Government is happy to have theopportunity to clarify this point. It fully concurs with the views expressedby you with regard to such territories. The United States Government does hotrecognise the lawfulness of such acquisitions and it agrees that such territoriesmust, in fact, be restored to Burma, Malaya and Indo-China, from whom theywere taken. This statement, of course, is without prejudice to the presentation of claims by any nation, including Thailand, for adjustments of boundaries ortransfers of territories by orderly, peaceful processes.It is finally noted that your statement favouring restoration of Thailandas a free, sovereign and independent State is, however, qualified by certain important reservations. You&apos; suggest that such restoration should be conditionedupon Thailand&apos;s &quot;acceptance of such special arrangements for security or economic collaboration as may be judged necessary within an international system.&quot; You further state : &quot; Some special strategic arrangements may also benecessary in the Kra Isthmus within the framework of an international securitysystem.&quot; It is not clear to the United States Government precisely what is contemplated by these reservations. In furtherance of the desire of the twoGovernments to reach a common understanding and to co-ordinate their policiestoward Thailand, the United States Government would appreciate receiving fromthe British Government at an early date an indication as to what it has inmind in connexion with these reservations. .Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.JOHN G. WINANT.
[F 4969/23/G] (5)(Secret.) Mr. Eden to Mr. Winant:My dear Ambassador,SINCE my return to this country I have been giving some thought to yournote of the 21st October about Siam.Such difference as may still exist between the respective points of view ofour two Governments results, I think, from the different angle of approach which I mentioned in my letter of the 4th September and which your replyrecognises. To us Siam is an enemy who must &quot;&quot;work her passage&quot; beforeshe can rehabilitate herself; whereas the United States Government regard her,in spite of her declaration of war,, merely as an enemy-occupied territory.The two conditions suggested in my letter of the 4th September, on which you asked for further clarification, were in the nature of general reservationsto be filled in in detail when the outline of the post-war settlement in the Far Eastis clearer. I should like to meet your Government^ wish for greater precision,but I do not really think that it is practicable to be more precise at this stagewhen there are so many unknown factors as regards the future. Nor could Iin any case attempt a binding definition without prior consultation with experts in this country, with the Dominions, and with the Cabinet. But! shall be happy to leview the matter with you from time to time as the situation develops.I cannot think that the general reservation which I made in paragraph 5of my letter of the 4th September will be other than acceptable to the UnitedStates Government. It is, I suggest, a matter of ordinary prudence, Oven in thecase of those who are but the satellites of our main enemies, to reserve the rightto stipulate that as a condition of their ultimate freedom, sovereignty and independence they should accept such special arrangements for security or economic collaboration as may be judged necessary to the functioning of thepost-war international system.As regards the special reservation affecting the Kra Isthmus,&apos;it is a matter for our respective military experts to recommend what regime may be necessaryin the circumstances of the post-war world. But the part which this areaplayed in the Japanese plans for the capture of Singapore and the ultimatesubjugation of Burma suggest that it will have to figure in whatever arrange-ments may be made for the future security of South-East Asia, and in particular for the defence of Singapore within the framework of the future international system.Finally, let me say that I welcome the statement in paragraph 5 of yournote about the restoration of territory acquired by Siam at the hands of japan from Burma, Malaya and Indo-Chino. This statement is valuable as it furthernarrows whatever difference there may be in the respective points of view of our two Governments.Yours sincerely,ANTHONY EDEN.[F 5522/23/G] (6)Policy towards Siam.(Top Secret.)THE following is an account of developments leading up to the correspondence between the United States Ambassador and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs circulated in F 4969/G.2. On the 26th February, 1943, Chiang Kai-shek broadcast an appeal tothe people and armed forces of Siam to rise against the Japanese. The fullestavailable version of his broadcast is given at Annex 1. The main points in itwere a solemn pledge that &apos;&apos; China and her Allies have no territorial designs onThailand and no intention whatsoever of violating Thailand&apos;s sovereignty and independence &apos;&apos; and a statement that &apos;&apos; Chinese war policy takes Thailand asa land under Japanese military occupation but not as an enemy. The objectof China&apos;s attack is on Japanese military strength and not on the Thai armed yforces and people.&quot;3. On the 12th March, 1943, President Roosevelt referred to this broadcastat a Press Conference. He summarised it and quoted parts of it with approval.In particular he quoted the passage referred to above about the absence of
territorial designs or any intention of violating Thai sovereignty and independence and he emphasised that it was &quot; a declaration of policy of Chinaand the United Nations.&quot;4. These declarations were not endorsed at the time by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment since it was felt that any similar declaration might limit our liberty of action in regard to the future of the Kra Isthmus, where there might be reasonsfor establishing United Nations naval, military or air bases.5. Towards the end of 1943, however, there seemed to be a possibility of anglo-American friction over the activities of the American Office of StrategicServices in relation to the &quot;Free Siamese &quot; question. The so-called &quot; Free Thaimovement&quot; outside Siam is led by the Siamese Minister at Washington.Although certain Siamese are being utilised and although the United StatesGovernment release monthly instalments of frozen Siamese funds to- cover theexpenses of the movement, the movement itself is not recognised either by HisMajesty&apos;s Government of by the United States Government. The O.S.S&apos;. were reported, however, to be encouraging the establishment of a Free Siamese Com-mittee in Chungking without any co-ordination with ourselves. The free Siameseon. their side were said to be discouraged by our failure to give them the kindof support which they had received in the declarations of the Generalissimo andthe President.6. Consideration was therefore given to the idea of the issue by HisMajesty&apos;s Government of a declaration similar to those made by Chiang Kai-shekand President Roosevelt in favour of a free and independent Siam but deprecatingthe formation of any &quot; Free Siamese Committee &quot; at that time owing to theabsence of any Siamese of sufficient authority to lead it and to reconcile thevarious personalities involved.7. On the 11th December, 1943, a semi-official communication was made tothe State Department by His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington to the effect thatwe were anxious to co-ordinate our action as regards policy towards Siam, andthat we hoped that there would be no new development in regard to the &quot; FreeSiamese&quot; except after full consultation between the State Department and ourselves. The State Department official concerned agreed that co-ordinationwas desirable and added, that the O.S.S. had been warned to make no politicalcommitments.- - 8. On the 26th February, 1944, the following draft declaration, which had previously been submitted to the Cabinet, was handed to the state department: -&quot; The position of Siam is in some respects unique in the Far East,though not without parallel in Europe. [N.B. The Canadian Governmentsubsequently asked that these last six words be omitted as possibly offensive to the French.] A country with a long tradition of friendship with us, has,though admittedly under pressure from Japan, betrayed that friendship.Not content with collaborating with our enemy and despite her Treaty ofNon-Aggression with us, the quisling Government of Luang Pibul took theinitiative in declaring war upon us.&quot; For these acts, Siam is already paying the price and will undoubtedlypay a yet heavier price as the war reaches her territories. It is still possiblefor the people of Siam to do something to save themselves from the worstconsequences of their betrayal, and they will be judged by the efforts whichthey make to redeem themselves from the position in which the action of theirpresent regime has placed them. Like other countries in like case &apos; theymust work their passage home.&apos; If they do so, they can look to this Countryto support the emergence of a free and independent Siam after the waris over.&quot;The State Department were informed orally that it was proposed to make this declaration at the first opportunity (the intention was to make it inParliament) and that it did not in our opinion tie our hands as regards. any political, economic or strategic arrangements thought to be desirable in theinterests of collective security after the war. Nor did it prejudice one way orthe other the question of the ultimate recognition of a free Siamese Conynitteewhich we proposed should be left in abeyance pending further clarification of the complex issues involved. Our interest was confined to seeing that the best usewas made of such free Siamese material as was at our joint disposal. we proposed to keep in close touch with the State Department and trusted that theywould agree to consult with us before any further step was taken.[29242] &apos; c
9. The text was also communicated to the Dominions. The australian government replied on the 24th March that they were in general accord with thepolicy of re-establishing Siam as a free and independent State. They felt,however, that there should be no commitments regarding Siam&apos;s independentStatehood which w*ould hinder or preclude satisfactory arrangements to ensurethe strategic requirements of security in that region. They were also concerned that independence should not be interpreted to the prejudice of arrangements for collaboration in development and welfare.10. The text was not well received in the State Department and from the outset members of the Department expressed the opinion that it would arousesuspicion of our motives among the American people.11. On the 21st March, Lord Halifax was handed the following statement about Siam by the State Department: &quot; This Government has given very careful consideration to the text ofthe declaration which the British Government propose to make in regard toSiam, a copy of which Sir George Sansom was so good as to bring personally to us. We have come to the conclusion that the declaration as it now stands,would not be helpful in giving encouragement, to the Siamese people to resist the Japanese, might very likely be exploited by the Japanese to the disadvantage of the United Nations, and would augment distrust in theUnited States and in China and elsewhere, of the motives of Great Britain.It is in fact this Governments feeling that it would be better that the &quot;Britishmake no declaration rather than make the proposed one under consideration,and that if the proposed declaration is to be made, it Avould be advisable thatit includes at least an unequivocal commitment that Great Britain has no territorial ambitions in Siam.&quot; The United States Government has not declared war on Siam althoughthe Siamese Government, after the Japanese occupation of Siam, declared war on the United States. We look forward to an early expulsion from Siamof the Japanese invaders. Until the Japanese are expelled from Siam, weshall -treat Siam for various purposes, including economic and psychologicalwarfare, as enemy-occupied territory. In any situation in which Siamesenationals or groups actively engage in and co-operate with the Japanese in military operations, whether offensive or defensive, against the Forces of theUnited States or of other of the United Nations, and in any situation inwhich the presence of Siamese Armed Forces obstructs operations orthreatens the security of the Forces of the United Nations, we shall treatthose Siamese Forces as enemy.&quot; The United States continues to regard Siam as an independent state. V/e do not recognise the present Siamese Government. we continue to recognise as &apos; Minister of Siam &apos; the Siamese Minister in Wash-ington who has denounced his Governments co-operation with Japan. we regard with sympathy the Free Siamese Movement in which &apos; the SiameseMinister in Washington is a prominent figure. We have not made, and wedo not contemplate making any political commitment to any particularSiamese national or Siamese group, prejudicing the future political situa-tion. We favour the restoration to Siam of complete security as a sovereign state, and we favour the creation in Siam of a Government which will represent the free will of the Siamese people.&quot;&apos; &quot;12. This communication crossed a telegram sent to His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Washington, on the 23rd March, drafted in the light of advanceindications of the American attitude which Lord Halifax had obtained. this telegram explained that we had deliberately omitted any reference to theterritorial integrity of Siam- (a) because with wider post-war settlements in mind, we had consistentlyrefrained from committing ourselves on post-war frontiers in generaleven in the cause of more deserving nations;(b*) because wre did not recognise the territorial transfers to Siam made by thtJapanese in 1941 and 1943 at the expense of Indo-China arid Malayarespectively; and(c) because our general attitude was already made clear in the CairoCommunique of the 1st December, 1943.
The telegram added that we were prepared to consider altering the emphasis ofour draft declaration so as to bring it more closely into harmony with the state-ment of United States - policy, which, we pointed out, also made no mention of&quot;territorial integrity.&quot;13. No action-&quot;was taken on this telegram in Washington at the time,pending the comments of His Majesty&apos;s&quot;Government on the full United-Statesstatement; but an explanation on the lines of it was given to the Counsellor of theUnited States Embassy in London on the 21st April, and by him passed back to washington.14. On the 3rd June, an oral suggestion was made to His Majesty&apos;s embassy at Washington by the State Department that if His Majesty&apos;s Government found it inconvenient to make a public declaration it would be useful if they could make a statement to the State Department which the latter might discreetlyconvey to Siam (presumably the Siamese Minister at Washington) for the purposeof encouraging the Siamese people. The official concerned added that the state department did not recognise territorial changes brought about by the japanese and thought of territorial integrity in terms of pre-war frontiers.15. On the 21st June a further announcement about Siam was made by the vice--President of the United States, Mr. Henry Wallace, in a speech at a Statebanquet at Chungking in which he said : &quot; We favour the restoration of nationalsovereignty to Thailand.&quot;16. Meeanwhile, on the 17th April, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, on the assumption that a declaration was still desirable for operational reasons, had submitted a revised form of declaration to the Cabinet. The textwas simultaneously communicated to the Dominions and they all concurred withoutamendment except in the case of the Australian Government. The latter sug-gested an amendment designed to avoid the inference that Siam&apos;s security wouldbe guaranteed without the contribution by Siam of facilities such as airfields.There &quot;was no difficulty in accepting the Australian amendment, and the final text as submitted to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in a memorandum of the 3rd July, read as follows :- ft &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom favour the restora-tion of Siam after the war as a free, sovereign and independent State andwish to see its security guaranteed within a general system. They cannot,however, forget that the Government of Luang Pibul took the initiative indeclaring war on Great Britain in spite of Siam&apos;s treaty of non-aggressionwith this country; and they would remind the Siamese people that theymust themselves contribute to their liberation. In the final settlement, accountwill inevitably be taken of that contribution.&quot;17. The Commonwealth Government stated that they would wish to issue a simultaneous declaration of which the .text was as follows :  &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Australian Government having in mind the statement by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of the 26th February, 1943, laterendorsed by President Roosevelt, and being in complete agreement withthe declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government, in the United Kingdom,-declares that it favours the restoration of Thailand after the war asa free, sovereign and independent State and wishes to see Thailand&apos;s security guaranteed within a general system. The Australian government does not forget, however, that the Government of Luang Pibul took theinitiative in declaring war on Britain in spite of Thailand&apos;s Non-aggression pact with Britain, and that Luang Pibul&apos;s Government has since associateditself with our enemies the Japanese who have menaced the very existenceof Australia. The Australian Government reminds the Thai people thatthey must themselves contribute to their liberation and fully concurs withthe view of the United Kingdom Government that in the final settlement,account will inevitably be taken of the extent of that contribution.&quot;18. The War Cabinet considered the revised declaration on the 10th July,but came to the conclusion that it would be premature to make a declarationabout Siam in the terms proposed at that juncture. Lord Halifax was instructedon the 26th July so to inform the State Department and, if the latter revertedto the offer reported in paragraph 14 above, to say that we did not feel that themoment was opportune for any communication to the Siamese, even by so indirecta channel.
19.   The reasons which weighed with the Cabinet against the issue of adeclaration were : (a) That it was in unduly favourable terms, bearing in mind the attitudeof Siam in going to war with us, notwithstanding the Treaty ofNon-Aggression.(b) That we should be asked to make corresponding statements about neigh-bouring territories, e.g., certain of the Malay States.(c) That it was undesirable to make a statement about Siam until we had   lJmade one about the future of Burma.(d) That it would be better not to make a declaration of this kind until we had recovered some of the territories which we had lost in theFar East.(e) That it was doubtful whether the declaration would be of much assistanceto our pre-occupational projects.Foreign Office,25th November, 1944.
