THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.W.P. (45) 113.2Uh February, 1945.SECRET.Copy No.WAR CABINET.FUTURE SETTLEMENT OF POLES IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE.IN accordance with a recent direction of the Prime Minister, the Committeeon the Reception and Accommodation of Refugees have examined the questions arising in connection with the possibility that a permanent home in the BritishEmpire might be offered to men of the Polish armed forces who might wish notto return to Poland.2. I append below, for the information of the War Cabinet, a brief reportby the Committee on this subject setting out various considerations that emergedduring the discussion..   (Initialled) A. E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,THE Committee were instructed to examine, in principle and without commitment, whether an offer could be made of a permanent home in the BritishEmpire to those men who have fought in the Polish Armed Forces under ourcommand and who may be deprived of their former homes by the future territorialsettlement between the Soviet Union and Poland.2. - The Committee met on the 23rd February, 1945, under the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, the HomeSecretary, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies were present.&apos; They had before them a note by the ForeignOffice dealing with the number of Poles likely to be concerned, the probable wishes of the Poles themselves in regard to their own future, and the responsibilites of u.N.R.R.A. and of the Inter-Governmental Committee on Refugees in the mattersunder consideration.3. After careful consideration, the Committee came to the conclusion thatthere were three main questions for discussion (a) the practicability of absorbing these persons into the British Empire;(b) the issues raised in connection with the granting of British nationalityto them, and how far this would be an essential feature of any scheme; and(c) whether the matter was one in which His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom should accept full responsibility, or whether it was more properly one in which the co-operation of the United nations or at least the United States should be sought before any commitmentswere entered into.Numbers involved.4. In the light of the available evidence, the Committee came to theconclusion that the number of Poles who might, for some reason or another, be anxious not to return to territories under the control of the Polish Government,could not be safely estimated as less than 100,000. This, number made some allowance for other groups at present outside Poland, and the families of thepersons concerned.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.24 h February, 1945.REPORT.[29290]
5. In addition it seemed necessary to bear in mind that strong pressure,might develop from other quarters, founded on any action promised in respect ofthe Poles. The Home Secretary called attention to the existence of numbersof Jews, refugees and persons who had lost their nationalities who might be anxious to seek asylum in the Empire. They would eventually have to be dealtwith by international agreement, but we might well have difficulty in refusing to give them as favourable treatment as the Poles. It might be possible to dis-criminate between those who had fought the Germans and those who had not,but there were large numbers of persons who, though dressed in khaki, had notbeen actively combatant.Practicability of absorption into British Empire.6. The Committee were&apos; informed that there was no possibility that theColonies could absorb any of these persons. Only small areas were habitable bywhite men and numbers were limited; for example, schemes under discussion forKenya and Tanganyika together contemplated the settlement of no more than,000 white persons.7. With regard to the Dominions, the Committee accepted the view of theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs that there was no chance that mass immi-gration would be permitted by the Dominion Governments. Poles granted british nationality might be accepted by the Dominions along with any other british nationals, but their numbers would be small, and would probably decrease to that extent the number of British migrants to the Dominions. The position regardingBritish nationality is dealt with more fully below.8. With regard to possibilities in the United Kingdom, the Home Secretaryexpressed the view that, apart from other objections, the presence of large foreignelements in this country might give rise to difficult political issues.Granting of British Nationality.9. The Home Secretary took the view that the granting of british nationality to a large body of Poles would ihake it almost impossible to avoid the indefinite extension of the principle to include large bodies of other personswho wished to change their nationality for political reasons. Moreover, whilethe possession of British nationality might assist as regards admission to a dominion, it was not sufficient. Many Dominions were afraid of taking largenumbers of non-British origin. Moreover, they had legislation enabling them to discriminate even against British subjects.Responsibility of His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government, and Conclusions.10. After considering these arguments, the Committee were left with theimpression that any large-scale scheme for&quot; resettling Polish Nationals, involvingBritish unilateral responsibility for dealing with the problem, would give riseto great difficulties. The Committee felt that other United Nations governments should also play their part and in particular that the United States, as co-signatory of the Yalta Agreement, might well be urged to accept an equal degreeof responsibility with the United Kingdom. Moreover, joint action might make possible, at the right moment, expedients such as use of ex-enemy territories.Failing the physical accommodation of Poles in British or American territory,it might be possible to offer a joint guarantee that the two countries would watchtheir interests.11. It was agreed that in the circumstances the consultation with theDominions which had been directed by the War Cabinet (W.M. (45) 23rdConclusions) should be confined to sounding them on the proposal to offer british nationality to the Poles in question, and the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs undertook to telegraph accordingly.12. The Committee felt that the general question of the settlement of non-repatriable refugees would before long have to be considered in its widest aspect.In the meantime, Lord Winterton and Sir Herbert Emerson (Chairman of theExecutive Committee of the Inter-Governmental Committee on Refugees andDirector of that body) might be informed confidentially that the Committee had. the whole question in mind, and would assemble to deal with it in due course.
