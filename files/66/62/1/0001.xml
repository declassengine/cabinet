(45) 96.24:th February, 1945. ,WAR CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY:  ARTICLE VII.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I attach a Summary Report by the group of our officials who have been discussing commercial policy and other related matters of Article VII with theAmerican officials under the authority given in W.M. (44) 153rd Conclusions,Minute 4.2. The Report is accompanied by a detailed Annex, which is printedseparately under reference W.P. (45) 97.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,24:th February, 1945. &quot;ARTICLE VII.Resumption of Informal Discussions with American Officials.Summary Report by the United Kingdom Officials.As authorised by the War Cabinet (W.M. (44) 153rd Conclusions),exploratory and non-committal talks were held between United Kingdom officials and United States officials in London between the 7th December, 1944, and the30th January, 1945. These were a continuation of the similar discussions heldat Washington in the autumn of 1943 on certain subjects covered by Article VIIof the Mutual Aid Agreement. The subjects dealt with in the resumed talks were(1) Commercial policy, (2) Commodity policy and (3) Cartel policy. (The two latter. subjects were taken up at the Americans&apos; request.) Thirteen meetingswere held in all, of which eleven were concerned with commercial policy and oneeach with commodity and cartel policy. (Monetary policy and Employment policy were not discussed on this occasion.)2. The United Kingdom officials participating in the resumed discussions were Sir W. Eady (Treasury), Sir P. Liesching (Board of Trade), ProfessorRobbins (War Cabinet Offices) and Mr. Shackle (Board of Trade). Sir D.Fergusson (Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries) was present for the discussionof our new proposals regarding foodstuffs (see paragraph 6 (iv) below) and relatedquestions; Miss Kilroy (Board of Trade) for cartels (see 7 II (b) below); andMr. Broadley and Mr. Wall (Ministry of Food) for a discussion on the UnitedKingdom bulk purchase contracts for food, which were considered in connectionwith the question of non-discrimination (see 6 (v) below). The United states officials were Mr. Harry Hawkins (formerly head of the Commercial RelationsDivision of the State Department, and now Economic Counsellor at the UnitedStates Embassy in London); Dr. Penrose and Mr. Loyd. Steere (AgriculturalAttache&quot; at tlje United States Embassy).[29228] b
3.   The terms of our instructions from the War Cabinet were that, in thecourse of these talks, United Kingdom officials should (a) ascertain the views of the State Department;(6) put forward the possibility of special provisions to cover foodstuffs ofthe types which entered into international trade, generally on the lines indicated in the Chancellor of the Exchequers memorandum .P. (44) 661, but without giving percentages or figures or entering into details;(c) explore the question of non-discrimination dealt with in Annex II of w.P. (44) 661.In eliciting the. views of the American officials, we also had in mind the trend of earlier discussions in the War Cabinet and the views of Ministers as thenexpressed.4. As regards (a) of our instructions, we found Mr. Hawkins ready to give us indications of the views of the State Department. He explained that sincethe discussions at Washington in 1943 a Committee of American officials had been working over the ground then covered, taking as their starting-point the&quot;Agreed Statements,&quot; which embodied the results of those discussions(reproduced in the Minister of - State&apos;s Memorandum W.P. (43) 559 (Revise)).Sub-Committees of this Committee had produced draft reports on the varioussubjects. Mr. Hawkins gave us a very full precis of the reports, and of a. detaileddraft Convention on Commercial Policy which emerged from them. -These reports had not yet, he explained, reached the stage of approval by united States Ministers. He urged that at this stage both sides should avoid&apos;&apos; taking up entrenched positions &quot;; it was his aim to obtain indications of anydoubts and difficulties felt by us, so that he could report these to Washington,thus giving the Executive the opportunity of trying to &quot; build bridges &quot; towards our point of view where possible. He has now returned to Washington to make his report.At the outset of our discussions, Mr. Hawkins expressed his view that a stage would shortly be reached when the subject could not usefully be further pursuedat the level of officials. He thought that as the next step, a team of high UnitedStates officials might come here, headed by a junior Minister, to continue thediscussions with a similar United Kingdom team, thus lifting them above the purely official and non-committal level. He did not, however, return to thissuggestion in the later stages of our discussions on further procedure (seeparagraph 7 I (7) below).5. We made it clear on our side that any views we expressed were tentativeand non-committal, and Mr. Hawkins went out of his way to make it clear that,where he offered comments or expressed views supplementing or going beyondthe reports of the Committee of American officials, he did so in a purely personal capacity. While the atmosphere was throughout very friendly, it was alsoextremely frank; there was no attempt on either side to minimise or gloss overdifferences of view.General points of interest.6. (i) Climate of United States opinion. It was a point to which mr. Hawkins often returned throughout the discussions that the climate of publicopinion in the United States is at the present moment peculiarly favourable for making progress towards satisfactory international economic arrangements,particularly in such matters as the reduction of the United States tariff. he drew attention to the evidence becoming available of the realisation in the UnitedStates Government circles that such a reduction is necessary if the United states is in future to be able to receive payment from the rest of the world for an expanding export trade; and he also assured us that there is now much moresupport than ever before in American public opinion, irrespective of party, fora reduction of their tariff.*  The war had, he said, drawn the United States closer* Note. In this connection, attention is drawn to a statement issued by the United states delegation, representative of a wide range of American business interests, at the InternationalBusiness Conference held at Eye. N.Y., in&apos;.November last.   This statement reads &quot; The United States can validate the presently contemplated exportation of its capital for purposes of reconstruction and development only by attaining an eventual excess ofimports over exports. The American Delegation recognises the urgent need for a general reduction of tariffs throughout the world and the elimination of other barriers to international trade. We feel tbat the United States should assume a position of aggressive leadershipin this movement, and, to the extent that revisions in tariff may be necessary to reverse our previous American trade balances, such tariff reductions should be made.&quot;
than before to the rest of the world, and American public opinion was nowconscious of what the lack of international co-operation on their part in thepast had cost them. He at once added, however, that with the return of peacea swing-back towards pre-war mental attitudes was to be expected. The moment was therefore peculiarly favourable psychologically for progress to be made with matters such as those which we had under discussion, and for this reason theState Department was anxious that the work should now be pressed forward with no loss of time, so that &quot; the tide might be taken at the flood.&quot;(ii) The multilateral method.-We indicated that general doubts had been felt in certain quarters here both as to the feasibility of dealing in a comprehensivemultilateral convention with the great variety of questions involved, and also as to whether the United Kingdom could thereby obtain help appropriate toits own special and difficult situation. In this situation, acts of faith were difficult.Some discussion took place on the possible alternative methods  (a) It could be argued that tariffs, owing to their complexity and diversity,could be more readily dealt with by the relatively selective method of bilateral negotiations;(b) however, the results of bilateral tariff negotiations -tend to be circum-scribed, since, owing to the operation of most favoured nation clauses in the negotiating countries&apos; treaties with third countries, concessionsare limited to the specialities of the negotiating countries : moreover,&apos;&apos; equivalence of concessions &apos;&apos; is the rule in such negotiations;(c) the restraining effect of most favoured nation obligations towards third countries becomes much more pronounced in bilateral negotiations on broad general undertakings, as e.g., to abolish quotas; indeed,such general undertakings would hardly be entered into unless alarge number of countries entered into them simultaneously;Id) a particularly important consideration for this country was that modifica-tions of Imperial preference which might be possible as a contributionon the part of the British Commonwealth towards a widespread andsimultaneous clearance of barriers to trade, would be very difficultto make in a bilateral agreement with the United States or any othersingle country.(iii) Imperial Preference. We formed the impression that United states officials, at least, have now realised that it would be unprofitable and, indeed,a positive obstacle to progress for them to press this issue upon us in the aggressivespirit in which they approached it in the 1943 Washington. discussions. Bothon that occasion and in the talks which have just concluded, we left the americans in no doubt as to the great importance attached to preferences as an expression of Empire solidarity, and the highly adverse reaction which would be produced in public opinion here by any excessive and injudicious American pressure on thesubject. Mr. Hawkins showed himself well aware of the Parliamentary debates ofApril last on &quot; Empire and Commonwealth Unity.&quot; And while, as will beseen later (paragraph 7 I (2)), the actual proposals which the Committee of american officials had evolved on the subject of preferences went clearly beyondanything which could be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, Mr. Hawkinsreceived without surprise and with less demur than might have been expected,the view we expressed that these proposals would need to be substantially modifiedif they were to stand any chance of acceptance here. He expressed the personalhope that it would be possible to reach some practical accommodation in thismatter without pursuing the underlying controversial issues.(iv) Our Suggestions Regarding Food-stuffs.- -These provisional suggestions,which we put forward on the general lines indicated in W.P. (44) 661, as modified by the Cabinet conclusions quoted in paragraph 3 (b) above, were noted by theAmerican officials and reported to Washington for consideration. The questionswhich they put to us on their own initiative, and later on instructions from theState Department, were intended purely for elucidation. However, such personalreactions as they expressed were, in general, favourable, and they appeared to be impressed by our arguments as to the inapplicability of the original Washingtonproposals to the special problems.of agriculture. They drew attention, however to the difficulty of forming a judgment in the United States on the merits of theproposals without being able to attach to the symbols employed (X, the ceiling for protection, and Y, the production datum) some approximate order&apos;of values. Wewere precluded by our instructions from naming any such values and were only[29228]   &apos; &quot; B 2
able to indicate in a general way that, in our conception, they would be of suchan order as not to conflict with the general tenor and standards of the Convention.(v) Non-discrimination in relation to the . programming of Imports-We discussed this question with the American officials on the lines of our instructions from Ministers&quot; (see paragraph 3 (c) above). The discussion disclosedlittle difference of view between the two sides. Generally, it was felt that thequestion&quot; was not one capable of being governed by precise rules, but that bothunder quantitative restrictions and State trading, the most equitable procedure would be to pay regard in the first place to the supplying countries&apos; respectiveshares of the trade in a representative past period, but that regard should alsobe paid to any &quot;-commercial considerations&quot; not represented in the base period.In particular, Mr. Hawkins accepted the view that &quot; commercial considerations &quot;would permit a large importing country to have regard to well-establishedarrangements with its normal suppliers for meeting the special needs of itsmarket, notwithstanding occasional low-priced offers from other sources. Therewas no difference of view on the point that consultation between an importingcountry and its main suppliers should be the normal practice.(vi) International Trade Organisation. We found that the Americansthroughout assumed the need to establish a central international organisation to watch over all aspects of international trade policy (including particularly com-mercial, commodity and cartel policy).(vii) Employment Policy. It is noteworthy that, to judge by the preamble to their draft Commercial Convention (see W.P. (45) 97 Annex I), the Americansnow appreciate the importance of policies directed to the maintenance of a high level of employment, especially in the United States itself, if international tradeis to enjoy any stable prosperity.(viii) Balance of the American proposals. We pointed out that while theAmerican proposals would require this country to take action in three directions,viz. (1) reduce tariffs (2) modify preferences and (3) eventually renounce the useof quantitative restrictions, save for certain approved purposes, from the UnitedStates it would in effect require only one form of action, viz., reduction of tariffs.We pointed out that it seemed particularly inappropriate in view of this position that we should be called on to abolish any preferences. Mr. Hawkins pointed outin reply that, on their side, the United States would enter into certain importantobligations of a negative character particularly not to adopt quantitativerestriction, save possibly in certain exceptional circumstances; moreover, the escape clauses of the Convention were, he thought, weighted in favour of theUnited Kingdom as compared with the United States. (See further paragraph  I (2) on Preferences.)The main points brought out in the discussions.7. W.P. (45) 97 contains a full summary of the points of substance dealtwith in the discussions (Annex I, Commercial Policy; Annex II, commodity policy; Annex III, Cartel Policy). In the following paragraphs we indicateonly those which appear of first-class importance. Supplementary details will ineach case be found in the appropriate Annex of W.P. (45) 97.I. Commercial Policy.(1) Tariffs. The American proposal (based on one put forward to them byCanadian officials early in 1944 in United States-Canadian discussions on article VII) is that all tariffs be reduced by one-half on the basis of the rates atJuly 1939, subject to a &quot; floor &quot; of 10 per cent, ad valorem, below which no duty would have to be reduced. We pointed out to them that this formula, which(apart from the &quot; floor &quot;) would treat high tariffs with no greater relative severitythan low ones, might well be less favourable to us than the reduction of tariffs to acommon ceiling, as we had proposed at Washington. We called attention toanother possible method of bringing about a graded reduction of duties accordingto their height (for details see W.P. (45) 97, Annex I). At the same time, we hadto admit that both the &quot; ceiling &quot; and any other method of graduating reductionsaccording to the height of tariffs would raise the formidable technical difficulty of ascertaining the ad valorem incidence of specific duties. Mr. Hawkins expressedthe view that the American proposal would not be inequitable as between theUnited States and the rest of the world, since by July 1939 the United Statestariff had been substantially reduced by the various Trade Agreements (including that with us) : thus the effect of their proposal would be to give the United Statesa tariff as low as she had had for the last 100 years.
The American proposals made no provision for special assistance to infantindustries save by means of subsidies. We felt justified in suggesting that thiswould present special difficulties, particularly for certain Dominions and India,and that, if a satisfactory solution were to be achieved, it would be necessary toconsider ways of permitting some measure of additional tariff protection, subjectto certain general rules. While we think we made some impression on mr. Hawkins personally, we feel convinced that this would be a particularly difficult point on which to convince the main body of United States officials concerned.We also expressed doubt whether subsidies could form a generally satis-factory means of assisting &quot; defence industries,&quot; and whether, here again, some special provision to permit of additional protection to such industries, underappropriate safeguards, might not be necessary.A novel American proposal was that special quota restrictions could be usedduring the first five years of the life of the Convention, and thereafter subjectto approval by the international organisation, to avoid grave damage to domesticindustries if there were a flood of imports resulting from the reduced duties.While not denying the justification for such a clause, we expressed toMr. Hawkins the fear that it might be used by the United States virtually tonullify the effects of reducing their tariffs during the first five years. He argued,in reply, that the clause is hedged with various safeguards : that it would facilitate acceptance of the proposals by those in the United States who feared.&apos;&apos; catastrophic &apos;&apos; risks : and that the United States Executive would only invokeit to deal with a grave emergency. He submitted in writing evidence supplied by the State Department of the success of their efforts in the past to avoidinvoking similar &quot;escape clauses &quot; under their Trade Agreements.General &quot; impairment &quot; clause. In connection with a particular difficulty,viz., that duties nominally of a revenue character might actually be prohibitive,Mr. Hawkins made a suggestion of some general importance, viz., that the Con-vention might contain a &quot; general impairment clause &apos;&apos; enabling any member country to withdraw from the Convention at short notice if any action taken byother member countries, outside the strict terms of the Convention, appeared tothe country affected to impair the objects of the Convention. (There were pre-cedents for this, e.g., in the United States-United Kingdom Trade Agreementof 1938.)(2) Preferences. The Americans proposed a combination of three methods for modifying preferences : .(i) The first method was one proposed to them by the Canadians in theirArticle VII discussions in 1944. It consisted in making the reduction of preferencethe automatic consequence of the reduction of the general tariff rates. Thus,where there was Empire-free entry, when the general rate was halved, the pre-ference margins would be halved; where Empire goods were subject to some rateof duty, but one less than half the general duty, the margins would be reduced bymore than half; and where the preferential duty was half or more than half thegeneral duty, preference would be extinguished.The Americans further proposed that (ii) the residual preferences left bythis process should be reduced to some further fraction (to be negotiated), and(iii) where the imports of a particular article coming in under preference are verysmall, that particular preference should be abolished. -We commented that the extinction of a certain number of preferences whichwould result from (i) would certainly be regarded as out of balance with a merehalving of tariffs : at least a residual preference of, say, 5 per cent, would, wewere sure, have to be retained in all cases : we added that the further american proposals (ii) and (iii) were in our judgment almost certain to be regarded as unacceptable.(3) Quantitative Regulation. The American proposals were that, in general,all quantitative restrictions should be abolished after a transition period of fiveyears from the date of entry into force of the Convention (during which periodthey must be used in a non-discriminatory manner). There would, however, be anumber of exceptions, temporary and permanent; the latter would include a balance of payments exception, as well as one in respect of &quot; scarce currencies &quot;against which discriminatory restrictions might be used. The balance of pay-ments exception would operate at any time when a country satisfies the monetary fund organisation that it is confronted with balance of payments difficulties;this, coupled with the proposals for allowing war-time restrictions to be continued
for an initial period, has an evident relevance to this country&apos;s &quot; transitiondifficulties. A further exception was provided for quantitative restrictions mconnection with domestic measures affecting particular commodities : we indicated that, while we might regard such an exception as desirable in connection with food-stuffs entering into international trade (a measure for which provision was madein our agricultural proposals), the suggestion as it stood seemed to open up toowide a&apos;loophole for the imposition of restrictions on other kinds of goods.(4) Exchange Clauses. The Americans had included in their draft Con-vention certain provisions about exchange, which would in some respects go beyond the Bretton Woods proposals-particularly.; by (i) totally prohibiting&quot; discrimination &quot;in the transition period; (ii) giving the International trade organisation a say in the matter of the liquidation of our accumulated war-timesterling debt balances; (iii) prohibiting the accumulation of similar debt balances in the future. We expressed surprise that the Americans wished to go beyondthe provisions of Bretton Woods, which had been the subject of very carefulconsultation between the United States and United Kingdom delegations, andwe explained fully to the Americans why any such extension would be unacceptable. At the same time we indicated that Ministers might perhaps be disposed to consider a suggestion tentatively put forward by Mr. Hawkins (if itwere formally made), viz., that there might be private consultation between theUnited Kingdom and the United States Governments, outside the discussions on this Convention, with regard to possible methods for liquidating the balances.(5) Subsidies-The Americans retained the Washington proposal thatexport subsidies should be prohibited but general production subsidies allowed.However, they introduced a new exception which would remove any limitation on the subsidising of particular products declared by the international organisa-tion to be in world surplus supply; these cases would be left to be dealt within ad hoc commodity agreements.We&apos;expressed strong misgivings as to the pressure which would be brought under the latter provision to conclude commodity agreements, which we fearedwould tend to have a bias in favour of producers. We used the- American cottonexport subsidy to exemplify our criticisms. Mr. Hawkins said that the Adminis-tration does not favour export subsidies, but that time is needed to educateAmerican public opinion.(6) Treatment of non-members. The American proposal is that no Stateadhering to the multilateral Commercial Convention shall extend its benefits toany non-member, except with the approval of the International Trade Organisa-tion. (This is similar to the solution generally favoured in our talks with theDominion and Indian officials in March, 1944.)We drew the Americans&apos; attention to the acute difficulty in which we shouldbe placed if some member of the British Commonwealth proved unwilling to adhere. They recognised this : Mr. Hawkins put forward personally thesuggestion that a list might be drawn up of the countries whose adherence tothe Convention would be necessary to bring it into force.. i (7) Further Procedure. We endeavoured, to ascertain from Mr. Hawkinshis ideas on future procedure, having first pointed out to him how unfavourablyany attempt would be received here to join this country with the United states in &quot;railroading the Convention through&quot; against a considerable body of opposition from other countries (especially, of course, if it came from any memberof the British Commonwealth).Mr. Hawkins said that he had no authority to make or discuss proposals inregard to future procedure, but, thinking aloud, he outlined the followingpossibilities and alternative courses, which he will be discussing with hiscolleagues on his return to Washington :  (A) It might be better that no detailed draft Convention should be putforward for international discussion at the initial stage.(B) There might instead be a short but definite Statement of Principles,corresponding to the main points of the draft convention as it emergesfrom the discussions with us. This Statement would include under-takings by the countries accepting it: (1) to become parties to theInternational Trade Organisation and (2) to set up an interim commission which would attempt to prepare a multilateral conventionbased on the Statement.
(C) The Statement would first be discussed with us.   It might then bepublished, either as (i) a joint United States-United Kingdomdocument, or (ii) by the United States Government alone, probablywith a mention that it had been discussed with us, and perhaps with- Russia and France also (possibly it might only be communicated inadvance to the two latter Governments).The United States Government would be unlikely to put out theStatement unless assured first of a favourable response by the UnitedKingdom Government. (We indicated that, if this procedure were adopted, it would be for the United Kingdom to discuss with otherMembers of the Commonwealth the manner in which they might be associated with the launching of any such project.)(D) Congress might be asked either (i) to pass a resolution authorising thePresident to seek world-wide implementation of the Principlescontained in the Statement, or (ii) to arm him with powers to enterinto an actual international agreement within the limits of thePrinciples.II.-(a) Commodity Policy and (b) Cartel Policy.Mr. Hawkins asked that these two subjects should also be briefly dealt within our discussions.(a) On Commodity Policy Mr. Hawkins said that opinion among UnitedStates officials is, on a majority view, favourable to making the international commodity Organisation part of the International Trade Organisation(which would thus cover commercial policy, commodity policy and cartels).Following the line emerging from the Dominion talks in March. 1944, weurged that objections would be likely to be raised against giving the centralcommodity organisation executive powers, and we suggested that a rather looserrelationship between the central organisation - and the bodies dealing withparticular commodities than had originally been contemplated might be likely tofind greater favour.There was a brief discussion concerning the place of international bufferstocks in international Commodity policy, and it was agreed that this method wasnot urged exclusively, the choice between it and other methods being a matter tobe decided on the merits in each particular case.It was agreed that the central desideratum in regard to international commodity policy was a generally accepted code of principles, to which anymethod that might be adopted in particular cases would have to conform.As to commodity regulation agreements, see under &quot; Subsidies &quot; (para-graph 7 I (5) above).(p) As regards Cartel Policy, we outlined the United Kingdom position(without, of course, describing the prospective legislation on internal restrictive practices), and indicated readiness to consider a course of action in the inter-national field on the lines provisionally approved by Ministers in reconstruction committee Paper R. (45) 18 (i.e., if a country complained to the international trade Organisation that an international cartel was affecting it prejudicially, theGovernments of the cartel members would, if there seemed to be a case for enquiry,each make their own enquiries : afterwards there would be consultation under the auspices of the International Trade Organisation. It would rest with each government to decide what action, if any, it should take).As at Washington, the Americans submitted proposals for registration ofinternational cartel agreements and prohibition of a list&apos;of cartel practices; butwe formed the impression that opinion among them is divided on this subject, andwe think that they were somewhat moved by our arguments as to the impracticable-ability and inexpediency of their own proposals.They urged, however, that the matter was one of great political importancein the United States, and they were specially anxious that effective steps shouldbe taken to prevent the&quot;International Commercial Convention from being frus-trated by private agreements. It would, Mr. Hawkins thought, be valuable fromthe point of view of United States opinion if we could agree to some formulainvolving even a limited and conditional commitment to take such action as was practicable in cases where frustration of the multilateral Commercial convention was shown to our satisfaction to be taking place. The general lines of such a formula were discussed, and reserved for further consideration by both sides.
Future A ction.8. Mr. Hawkins has now returned to Washington for consultations, fromwhich he expects to return to London early in March. As already indicated, theobject of his consultations will be to see how far the Americans may feel it possible to move in order to meet us on the various points where our talks revealeddivergences of view. In general, Ministers may. perhaps think it advisable to await his return and news of the American reactions before taking any further decisions, while authorising a resume of the discussions to be transmitted to theGovernments of the Dominions and of India.dth February, 1945. &apos;   &quot;
