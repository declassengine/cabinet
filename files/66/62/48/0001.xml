. ut^..^.JU.UX 7-3 &amp; &amp;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.   ; Copy No.W.P. (45) 143.5th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.ROUMANIAN  POLITICAL PARTIES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues a note on someof the personalities and parties mentioned in recent telegrams from Roumania.A. E.Foreign Office, 5th March, 1945.The following are some notes on the parties and personalities mentioned inrecent Bucharest telegrams : The National Democratic Front is a union of three parties : the Communists,Social Democrats and Ploughmen&apos;s Front. . The Communists are sometimesreferred to as the Worker&apos;s Union. The leaders of the three parties are:Communists, Patrascanu; Social Democrats, Petrescu; the Ploughmen&apos;s Front,Groza.Patrascanu has been one of the acknowledged leaders of the RoumanianCommunists for many years. He led the Armistice Delegation to Moscow andwas one of the Roumanian signatories.Petrescu is a well-known criminal lawyer and has been the leader of theSocial Democratic Party since 1943.Groza is a Transylvanian lawyer of doubtful financial reputation, whoamassed a large fortune at the end of the last war while dealing with Agrarianreform and expropriation proceedings. He is to all intents and purposes a communist.There is no reason to describe the aims of the Communists or social democrats, but the Ploughmen&apos;s Front needs explaining. It is an offshoot of theCommunist Party. In August of last year a number of Communists detachedthemselves from the main Party to form the Front under the leadership of Groza.The closest possible links are maintained with the parent Party and their policies&quot;are more or less identical, though the Ploughmen&apos;s Front concentrates more thanthe Communists on agricultural reform. The purpose of the formation of theFront was initially the hope that Communism would make more peasant convertsunder another name, but it has proved an extremely useful tactical weapon whencoalition Governments came to be formed. The association of the Ploughmen&apos;sFront and the Communist Party in the National Democratic Front waspublicised as a union of two parties, thus giving the impression that the NationalDemocratic Front represented more than the Communists alone, and they haveclaimed separate representation in the Cabinet for both &quot; parties.&quot;The Ploughmen&apos;s Front are strongest in Transylvania. We have no preciseestimate of their strength, but as the whole National Democratic Front is thought to represent about 15 per cent, of the total population it must be very small. Itappears, however, that they have succeeded in detaching some members ofManiu&apos;s Peasant Party who prefer to back what they think is the winning horse.Tatarescu, whom the Russians would like to see in the Government, wasone of the leaders of the National Liberal Party after 1918. He was PrimeMinister on several occasions and was in power as Prime Minister when King12689   [29369]
Carol abolished the constitution. This led to a break between him and theLiberal Party, Later he was responsible for signing the Commercial treaty with Germany, which was the first step towards the German domination of roumania. There can be no doubt as to his pro-German leanings at that time.Subsequently, during the war, he is supposed to have engaged in conversations with the Russians and to have been aware of Russian plans for bringing KingCarol back to form a puppet government. It is no doubt from this period that russian confidence in him can be dated.Lupu, another figure whom the Russians say would like to see in the new government, is an old man and joint founder of the National Peasant Partywith Maniu. Until.very recently he was joint; Vice-President of the NationalPeasant Party. He has been known as a firm friend of this country and during thelast war he was a Roumanian propagandist with the Allies. It is not quite clearwhy he should be persona grata with the Russians, but presumably this is dueto the fact that he has severed his connexion with the National Peasant party and can be regarded as a valuable figurehead.It may be useful to note the representation of the various parties in thedismissed Radeseu Government. Radescu himself was non-party. He was supported by five representatives of the National Peasant Party, three membersof, the Liberal Party, two non-party representatives and six or seven membersof the National Democratic Front. Groza and Patrascanu were both membersof the Government.Mihalache is a leader of the National Peasant Party and has held manyCabinet posts. He has great influence among the peasants. M. Leucutia is oneof Maniu&apos;s close collaborators and there is no present indication that he willjoin a minority Government in which his party is not represented.
