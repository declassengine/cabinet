ARTICLE VII.Resumption of Informal Discussions with American Officials.Detailed Report by the United Kingdom Officials.introduction. As authorised, by the War Cabinet (W.M. (44) 153rd Conclusions,Minute 4), exploratory and non-committal talks were held between UnitedKingdom officials and United States officials in London between the 7th December,1944, and the 30th January, 1945. These were a continuation of the similardiscussions held at Washington in the autumn of -1943 on certain subjects coveredby Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement. -The subjects dealt with in the resumed talks were (1) Commercial policy, (2) Commodity policy and (3) Cartelpolicy. (The two latter subjects were taken up at the Americans&apos; request.)Thirteen meetings were held in all, of which eleven were concerned with commercial policy and one each with commodity and cartel policy. (monetary policy and employment policy were not discussed on this occasion.)2. The United Kingdom officials participating in the resumed discussions were Sir Wilfrid Eady (Treasury), Sir Percivale Liesching (Board of Trade),Professor Robbins (War Cabinet Offices) and Mr. Shackle (Board of Trade).Sir Donald Fergusson (Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries) was present &quot;forthe discussion of our new proposals regarding food-stuffs (see paragraph 6 (iv)below) and related questions; Miss Kilroy (Board of Trade) for cartels; andMr. Broadley and Mr. Wall (Ministry of Food) for a discussion on the UnitedKingdom- bulk purchase contracts for food. The United States officials wereMr. Harry Hawkins (formerly head of the Commercial Relations Division of theState Department, and now Economic Counsellor at the United States embassy in London); Dr. Penrose, and Mr. Loyd Steere (Agricultural Attache at theUnited States Embassy).3. The terms of our instructions from the War Cabinet were that, in thecourse of these talks, United Kingdom officials should (a) ascertain the views of the State Department;(b) put forward the possibility of special provisions to cover food-stuffs of the types which entered into international trade, generally on the lines indicated in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum .P. (44) 661, but without giving percentages or figures, or entering into details;(c) explore the question of non-discrimination dealt with in Annex II of w.P. (44) 661.In eliciting the views of the American officials, we also had in mind the trend of earlier discussions in the War Cabinet and the views of Ministers as thenexpressed.These earlier discussions included, in particular, the following : (i) consideration of the general proposals for a multilateral convention, andof objections thereto, set out in W.P. (43) 136 : the War Cabinet onthe 8th April, 1943 (W.M. (43) 50th Conclusions, Minute 1), recordeda provisional conclusion in favour of taking the initiative in putting forward the proposals for a multilateral convention as a basis fornon-committal discussions, first with Dominion officials, and subse-quently with the Americans;(ii) the War Cabinet decision of the 27th July, 1943 (W.M. (43) 106thConclusions, Minute 4), that a delegation of officials should be sentto Washington to discuss the whole field covered by Article VII of the mutual Aid Agreement; at the same time, an outline of proposals fora possible multilateral convention on commercial policy was approvedbasis for non-committal discussion;(iii) the report (W.P. (44) 121) presented by a Committee of Ministers onthe 18th February, 1944; arising out of the Minister of State&apos;s reporton the Washington discussions (W.P. (44) 75 and (44)81); on the23rd February, 1944 (WM. (44) 24th Conclusions, Minute 3), the WarCabinet decided that the report of the Committee of Ministers, while not carrying the War Cabinefs authority, could be used by UnitedKingdom officials as a guide in further discussions with dominion and Indian officials;
(iv) the War Cabinet&apos;s decision of the 27th April, 1944 (W.M. (44) 58thConclusions, Minute 4), to present to the Dominion Prime Ministers,subject to certain explanations and on the understanding that theCabinet was not committed to it, the scheme as so far worked out, anddescribed in a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(W.P. (44)217);(v) the.War Cabinet&apos;s decision of the 18th July, 1944 (W.M. (44) 92nd Con-clusions, Minute 1), to approve a telegram to the Minister of state in Washington,- authorising him to inform the United states administration, inter alia, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would beready for further discussions in the autumn of 1944.4. As regards (a) of our instructions, we found Mr. Hawkins very ready togive us indications of the views of the State Department. He explained that since the discussions at Washington in 1943 a Committee of American officials had been working over the ground then covered, taking as their starting point the &quot; Agreed Statements &quot; which embodied the results of these discussions(reproduced in the Minister of State&apos;s Memorandum W.P. (43) 559 Revise).Sub-Committees of this Committee had produced draft reports on the varioussubjects. Mr. Hawkins gave us a very full precis of the reports and of a detailed draft Convention on Commercial Policy which emerged from them.These reports had not yet, he explained, reached the stage of approval by united States Ministers. He urged that at this, stage both sides should avoid&apos;&apos; taking up entrenched positions &quot;; it was his aim to obtain indications of anydoubts and difficulties felt by us, so that he could report these to Washington,thus giving the Executive the opportunity of trying to &apos;&apos; build bridges &apos;&apos; towards our point of view where possible. He has now returned to Washington to make his report.At the outset of our discussions, Mr. Hawkins expressed his view that a stage would -shortly be reached when the subject could not usefully be further pursuedat the level of officials. He thought that as the next step a team of high UnitedStates officials might come here, headed by a junior Minister, to continue thediscussions with a similar United Kingdom team, thus lifting them above the purely official and non-committal level. He did not, however, return to thissuggestion in the later stages of our discussions on further procedure (seeparagraph 8 below).5. We made it clear on our side that any views we expressed were tentativeand non-committal, and Mr. Hawkins went out of his way to make it clear that,when he offered comments or expressed views supplementing or going beyondthe reports of the Committee of American officials, he did so in a purely personal capacity. While the atmosphere was throughout very friendly, it was alsoextremely frank; there was no attempt on either side to minimise or gloss overdifferences of view.General Points of Interest.(i) Climate of United States opinion.6. It was a point to which Mr. Hawkins often returned throughout thediscussions that the climate of public opinion in the United States is at the presentmoment peculiarly favourable for making progress towards satisfactory inter-national economic arrangements, particularly in such matters as the reductionof the United States tariff. He drew attention to the evidence becoming available of the realisation in United States Government circles that such a reduction isnecessary if the United States is in future to be able to receive payment fromthe rest of the world for an expanding export trade; and he also assured us thatthere is now much more support than ever before in American public opinion,irrespective of party, for a reduction of their tariff.* The war had, he said, drawn* Note.-In this connection, attention is drawn to a statement issued by the United states delegation, representative of a wide range of American business interests, at the InternationalBusiness Conference held at Rye, N.Y., in November last.   This statement reads -&quot; The United States can validate the presently contemplated exportation of its capital for purposes of reconstruction and development only -by attaining an eventual excess ofimports over exports. The American delegation recognises the urgent need for a general reduction of tariffs throughout the world and the elimination of other barriers to international trade. We feel that the United States should assume a position of aggressive leadership inthis movement, and, to the extent that revisions in tariff may be necessary to reverse our previous American trade balances, such tariff reductions should be made.&quot;[29263] b 2
the United States closer than before to the rest of.the world, and American publicopinion was now conscious of what the lack of international co-operation ontheir part in the past had cost them. He at once added, however, that with thereturn of peace a swing-back towards pre-war mental attitudes was to be expected.The moment was therefore peculiarly favourable psychologically for progress tobe made with matters such as those which we had under discussion, and for thisreason, the State Department was anxious that the work should now be pressed forward with no loss of time, so that &quot; the tide might be taken at the flood.&quot;(ii) The multilateral method. &apos;We indicated that general doubts had been felt in certain quarters here both as to the feasibility of dealing in a comprehensive multilateral convention withthe great variety of questions involved, and also as to whether the UnitedKingdom could thereby obtain help appropriate to its own special and difficult situation.   In this situation acts of faith were difficult.Some discussion took place on the possible alternative methods : (a) It could be argued that tariffs, owing to their complexity and diversity,could be more readily dealt with by the relatively selective method of bilateral negotiations;(b) however, the results of bilateral tariff negotiations tend to be circum-scribed, since, owing to the operation of most favoured nation clauses in the negotiating countries&apos; treaties with third countries, concessionsare limited to the specialities of the negotiating countries; moreover,&apos;&apos; equivalence of concessions &apos;&apos; is the rule in such negotiations;(c) the restraining effect of most favoured nation obligations towards third countries becomes much more pronounced in bilateral negotiations on broad general undertakings, as, e.g., to abolish quotas; indeed, such general undertakings would hardly be entered into unless a large. *  number of countries entered into them simultaneously;(d) a particularly important consideration  for. this country was thatmodifications of Imperial preference, which might be possible as a contribution on the part of the British Commonwealth towards a widespread and simultaneous clearance of barriers to trade, would bevery difficult to make in a bilateral agreement with the United states or any other single country.(iii) Imperial Preference.We formed the impression that United States officials, at least, have nowrealised that it would be unprofitable and indeed a positive obstacle to progress for them to press this issue upon us in the aggressive spirit in which theyapproached it in the 1943 Washington discussions. Both on that occasion andin the talks which have just concluded, we left the Americans in no doubt as tothe great importance attached to preferences as an expression of Empiresolidarity, and the highly adverse reaction which would be produced in publicopinion here by any excessive and injudicious American pressure on the subject.Mr. Hawkins showed himself well aware of the Parliamentary debates of april last on &quot;Empire and Commonwealth Unity.&apos;-&apos; . And while, as will be seen later(Annex I, Chapter I, Section B (2)), the actual proposals which the Committeeof American officials had evolved on the subject of preferences went clearlybeyond anything which could be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government,Mr. Hawkins received without surprise and with less demur than might havebeen expected, the view we expressed that these proposals would need to be substantially modified if they were to stand any chance of acceptance here. he expressed the personal hope that it would be possible to reach some practicalaccommodation in this matter without pursuing the underlying controversialissues.(iv) Our Suggestions Regarding Foodstuffs.These provisional suggestions, which we put forward on the general lines indicated in W.P. (44) 661, as modified by the Cabinet conclusions quoted inparagraph 3 (&amp;) above, were noted by the American officials and reported to washington for consideration. The questions which they put to us on their own initiative, and later on instructions from the State Department, were intendedpurely for elucidation. However, such personal reactions as they expressed were,in general, favourable and they appeared to be impressed by our arguments as to
the inapplicability of the original Washington proposals to the special problemsof agriculture. They drew attention, however, to the difficulty of forming a judgment in the United States on the merits of the proposals without being ableto attach to the symbols employed (X, the ceiling for protection, and iT, theproduction datum) some approximate order of values. We were precluded by our instructions from naming any such values, and were only able to indicate ina general way that, in our conception, they would be of such an order as not toconflict with the general tenor and standards of the Convention. (For further details, see Annex I, Chapter II). .(v) Non-Discrimination in Relation to the Programming of Imports.We discussed this question with the American officials, on the lines of our instructions from Ministers (see paragraph 3 (c) above). The discussion disclosedlittle difference of view between the two sides. Generally, it was felt that thequestion was not one capable of being governed by precise rules, but that bothunder quantitative restrictions and State trading, the most equitable procedure would be to pay regaTd in the first place to the supplying countries&apos; respectiveshares of the trade in a representative past period, but that regard should alsobe paid to any &quot; commercial considerations &quot; not represented in the base period.In particular, Mr. Hawkins accepted the view that &quot; commercial considerations &quot;would permit a large importing country to have regard to well-establishedarrangements with its normal suppliers for meeting the special needs of itsmarket, notwithstanding occasional low-priced offers from other sources. Therewas no difference of view on the point that consultation between an importingcountry and its main suppliers should be the normal practice.(For further details see Annex I, Chapter III.)(vi). International Trade Organisation.We found that the Americans throughout assumed the need to establish a central international organisation to watch over all aspects of international trade policy (including particularly commercial, commodity and cartel policy).(vii) Employment Policy.It is noteworthy that, to judge by the Preamble to their draft CommercialConvention (see Annex I, Chapter I, page 7), the Americans now appreciate the importance of policies directed to the maintenance of a high level of employ -ment, especially in the United States itself, if international trade is to enjoyany stable prosperity.(viii) Balance of the American Proposals.We pointed out that while the American proposals would require thiscountry to take action in three directions, viz. (1) reduce tariffs (2) modifypreferences and (3) eventually renounce the use of quantitative restrictions, savefor certain approved purposes, from the United States it would in effect requireonly one form of action, viz., reduction of tariffs. We pointed out that it seemedparticularly inappropriate in view of this position that we should be called on to abolish any preferences.Mr. Hawkins pointed out in reply that, on their side, the United States would enter into certain important obligations of a negative character particularly notto adopt quantitative restriction, save possibly in certain exceptional circum-stances; moreover, the escape clauses of the Convention were, he thought, weightedin favour of the United Kingdom as compared with the United States.(See further on Preferences, Annex I, Chapter I, Section B (2)).Resumes of the Discussions on Particular Subjects.7. The Annexes to this paper contain a full summary of the points of substance dealt with in the discussions on the various subjects (Annex I, Com-mercial Policy; Annex II, Commodity Policy; Annex III, Cartel Policy).Future Procedure,8. At the conclusion of the discussions on. these subjects, we endeavoured toascertain from Mr. Hawkins his ideas on future procedure, particularly asregards the Commercial Policy proposals.   We first pointed out to him how
unfavourably any attempt would be received here to join this country with theUnited States in &quot; railroading through &quot; any&apos; Convention against a considerablebody of opposition from other countries (especially, of course, if it came from anymember of the British Commonwealth).Mr. Hawkins said that he had no authority to make or discuss proposals in regard to future procedure, but, thinking aloud, he outlined the followingpossibilities and alternative courses, which he will be discussing with his col-leagues on his return to. Washington : -(A) It might be better that no detailed draft Convention should be putforward for- international discussion at the initial stage.(B) There might instead be a short but definite Statement of Principles,corresponding to the main points of the draft Convention as it emergesfrom the discussions with us. This Statement would include under-takings by the countries&apos;accepting it (1) to become parties to theInternational Trade Organisation and (2) to set up an interim Corn-mission which would attempt to prepare a multilateral conventionbased on the Statement.(C) The Statement would first be discussed with us.   It might then bepublished, either as (i) a joint United States-United Kingdomdocument, or (ii) by the United States Government alone, probablywith a mention that it had been discussed with us, and perhaps with.Russia and France also (possibly it might only be communicated inadvance to the two latter Governments).The United States Government would be unlikely to put out theStatement unless assured first of a favourable response by the UnitedKingdom Government. (We indicated that, if this procedure were adopted, it would be for the United Kingdom to discuss with otherMembers of the Commonwealth the manner in which they might be associated with the launching of any such project.)(D) - Congress might be asked either (i) to pass a resolution authorising thePresident to seek world-wide implementation of the Principlescontained in the Statement, or (ii) to arm him with powers to enterinto an actual international &quot;agreement within the limits of thePrinciples.February, 1945.ANNEX I.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Chapter I. The American Draft Convention.Mr. Hawkins outlined to us (he did not feel at liberty to give us the full text)a draft multilateral Convention on Commercial&apos; Policy which had been preparedby a Sub-committee of the &quot; Executive Committee on Economic Foreign Policy.&quot;This is a committee of officials. The draft had not yet been approved by the fullcommittee preparatory to its submission to United States Ministers.The main points of this draft Convention are summarised below, with (where necessary) an indication of the main provisional comments which we made upon them and of Mr. Hawkins&apos; replies and supplementary explanations. (In generalhe noted our points, for report to Washington. His comments and replies were of a personal character.)The American draft Convention is divided into a Preamble and sevensections, as follows : A. General commercial provisions.B. Tariffs and preferences.C. Quantitative regulation.D. Exchange Control.E. State trading.F. Subsidies.G. General exceptions.
Preamble.The American draft sets out that employment policy is not solely a domestic concern, and that it calls for international consultation so that mutuallyconsistent programmes can be evolved. The reduction of trade barriers and orderly procedures in international trade should be sought after, but international commercial measures alone would not ensure against economic depressions and unemployment: appropriate, domestic policies were also necessary. the prosperity of each country depended, to- a large extent, on the prosperity of othersand especially of the major countries. The general objective should be theexpansion of world trade on the basis of comparative efficiency, but combined with a reasonable measure of stability. Employment policy in one nation shouldnot be such as to aggravate the situation of other nations and disruptive measures in the international field should be avoided.Section A. General Commercial Provisions.Apart from a general provision for most-favoured-nation treatment between countries adhering to the proposed International Commercial Convention, thisSection deals with various incidental matters, mostly of comparatively minor-importance, such as Customs formalities, internal taxes, anti-dumping duties,tariff valuations, marks of origin, and statistics. The provisions suggested do not for the most part make any major innovations compared with past treaty practice and international Conventions: generally their object is.to avoid discrimination and indirect protection. Anti-dumping and countervailing duties would be permitted on a clearly defined basis, intended to rule out duties which would ineffect give supplementary protection.Section B. Tariffs and Preferences.1  Tariffs.American Proposals.General rates to be reduced to one half of their height as at July 1939, but noduty need be reduced below a &quot; floor &quot; of 10 per cent, ad val. (This was based ona proposal put forward to the Americans by Canadian officials early in 1944, intheir separate discussions on questions arising under Article VII of the mutual aid Agreement.)Our comments on Tariffs and Mr. Hawkins&apos;s replies.(i) Method of reduction.Apart from the &quot; floor &quot; exemption for duties of 10 per cent, and under, theAmerican proposal would treat high tariffs no more severely than low ones, andwas thus less favourable to us and other countries in a similar position than a tariff &quot; ceiling &quot; (i.e., no duty to exceed x ad valorem), such as we proposed atWashington, would have been. We did not dwell on the &apos;&apos; ceiling &apos;&apos; proposal,which, admittedly raised certain technical difficulties (determination of thead valorem incidence of specific duties), but enquired whether Mr. Hawkins had considered an alternative method by which a graduated reduction, affecting highduties more than low ones, could be secured. This consisted in reducing all dutiesby a specified fraction, and then adding back an ad valorem &quot; constant&quot;(example : if duties are to be halved, and the constant is 5 per cent., then 50Duty of 50 per cent, becomes     -I- 5 = 30 per cent.20Duty of 20 per cent, becomes     + 5 = 15 per cent.15Duty of 15 per cent, becomes     + 5 = 12$ per cent.Duty of 10 per cent, stands unaltered.)We recognised that this formula might also raise technical difficulty inconnection with specific tariffs.Mr. Hawkins replied that an all-round cut of a.half based on the 1939 rates,with a floor of 10 per cent., would not seem seriously&quot; inequitable as between the
United States and the rest of the world, since the United States tariff had alreadyby 1939 been greatly reduced under Trade Agreements (including that with theUnited Kingdom). Halving the 1939 rates would result in reversion to a tariffas low as the United States had had for the past 100 years.(ii)&quot; Infant industries and defence industries.We enquired about the status of infant industries, and discovered that the americans proposed that exclusive reliance should be placed on subsidies as a means of assisting such industries. We urged that this would certainly not satisfy &quot;undeveloped&apos;&apos; countries, nor, particularly, Australia or India; some limited tariff facility to meet such cases possibly by way of special &quot; tapering &quot;duties subject to a time-limit seemed essential. The point was of much importance, since the acceptability of any multilateral scheme to the&apos;&apos; undeveloped &apos;&apos; countries might depend on it.We also expressed doubt whether subsidies could form a generally satisfac-tory means-of assisting defence industries, and whether, here again, some special provision to permit of additional protection to such industries, under appropriatesafeguards, might not be necessary.Mr. Hawkins undertook to have our suggestion on &quot; infant &quot; industriesconsidered; he appreciated the importance of the point. (While we think we made some impression on Mr. Hawkins personally, we feel that this would be a particularly difficult point on which to convince the main body of United states officials concerned.) As to &quot;defence&quot; industries, definition was the difficulty;we suggested that this might be solved by reference to decisions of the inter-national political organisation; thus, special measures might be permitted to countries to which the organisation assigns special defence responsibilities.(iii) Revenue Tariffs.It did not appear from Mr. Hawkins&apos;s original exposition whether the caseof revenue tariffs had been adequately provided for. We pointed out that.e.g., many British Colonies depend on import duties for revenue; there would be intolerable effects on their economies if their tariffs were simply cut by somegeneralised percentage and then frozen. There would need to be some exception for revenue duties where these are essential to the financial structure of thecountry.Mr. Hawkins explained that the American proposals for reduction would not affect &quot; revenue &quot; duties, i.e., import duties in so far as they are countervailed by internal excise taxes (even &apos;&apos; notional&apos;&apos; excises on goods of a kind not produced inthe country).(iv) Effect of price increases on specific duties.The American proposal for a 50 per cent, cut seemed to neglect the fact that price rises since 1939 will have automatically reduced the ad vol. incidence of specific duties. We raised the question whether some allowance should not be madefor this if any general &quot; cut &quot; is to operate equitably as between specific andad vol. tariffs. Mr. Hawkins noted our point, on which he appeared to have no special instructions.(v) The tariff &quot;floor.&quot;At the Washington talks it had not been clear whether the Americansacknowledged the permissibility of raising existing duties or imposing new duties up to the &quot; floor &quot; level of 10 per cent. We therefore revived this point and urged that, in our judgment, it would be a material consideration; otherwisecountries dependent on tariffs for revenue could not recoup their losses of revenueunder the general &quot;cut.&quot; Mr. Hawkins again noted our point, without specialcomment.(vi) New duties.We asked if provision were made for new &quot;duties, particularly in cases wherethere are at present quotas but no duties, if the American proposal for theabolition of quotas as normal method of protection were accepted (see below,Section C).Mr. Hawkins noted our point, but observed that for, e.g., bacon and muttonin this country, it would be covered by our new proposals for the treatment of food-stuffs, if accepted (see Chapter II of this Annex).
(vii) Revenue duties with prohibitive effect.We asked if provision were made for some remedy (e.g., by way of recourse to the International Trade Organisation) for countries whose interests are pre-prejudiced by a duty in.another country which, while nominally of a revenuecharacter, is actually prohibitive.Mr. Hawkins noted this. In this connection, he made a suggestion of some general importance, viz., that the Convention might contain a &quot; general impair-ment clause &quot;enabling any member country to withdraw from the Convention at short notice if any action taken by other member countries, outside the strict termsof the Convention, appeared to the country affected to impair the objects of theConvention. (There were precedents for this, e.g., in the United States-UnitedKingdom Trade Agreement of 1938.)2. Preferences.A merican proposals.The Americans proposed a combination of three methods for modifyingpreferences : *(a) The first method was one proposed to them by the Canadians in theirArticle VII discussions in 1944. It consisted in making the reductionof preference the automatic consequence of the reduction of the generaltariff rates. Thus, under the tariff reduction proposal described inSection B, 1, above,(i) where there is now preferential free entry, the margins wouldbe halved;(ii) where the preference margin exceeds half the general duty, acertain part of it would remain;(iii) where the preference margin is half or less than half the generalduty, the preference would be abolished.All the above would be subject to the qualification that where the generalduty is 10 per cent, or less it would be exempt from reduction under the &quot; floor &quot;provision, so that the preference margins would not be affected in those cases.(&amp;) The residual preferences deft by (a) were to be further reduced to a specified fraction (to be negotiated) of the margins at July 1939.(c) Where aggregate imports of a product in 1939 from countries enjoyingpreference were less than 5 per cent, of total imports of the product,the preference should be abolished.Our Comments on Preferences.(i) Political aspects.We emphasised the great importance attached to preferences as an expression of Empire solidarity, and the highly adverse reaction which would be produced in public opinion here by any excessive American pressure on the subject.(ii) Balance between tariff and preference proposals.We commented that the American proposals went far beyond the suggestion which we had put forward at Washington for a halving of preference margins,subject to the 5 per cent, floor. We added that the extinction of a certain numberof preferences which would&apos;result from.the American proposal (a) would, certainly be regarded as out of balance with a mere halving of tariffs. At least a residualpreference of, say, 5 per cent, would, we were sure, have to be retained in all cases.The further American proposals (b) and (c) were, in our judgment, almost certain to be regarded as unacceptable.(iii) We pointed out the absence of provision for preferences in connectionwith quotas and State trading.Mr. Hawkins&apos; reply to our comments on preferences.Mr. Hawkins undertook to report our views. He pointed out that publicopinion in the United States attaches great importance to a modification of preferences.    While not entering upon discussion of the relation between[29263] .   . c
preferences and &apos;&apos; discrimination,&apos;&apos; and expressing the personal hope that it wouldbe possible to reach a practical compromise, he observed that (a) Article VII ofthe Mutual Aid Agreement looks to action directed towards the elimination ofdiscriminations, but to the reduction of tariffs; (6) Mr. Acheson, in a recentpublic speech, referred to the objectives of &quot; reduction of tariffs to reasonablelevels, and the progressive elimination of quotas, preferences and barriers totrade.&quot; The acceptance by United States public Opinion of the obligations whichthe draft Convention would lay upon it (particularly the reduction of their tariff)would, he said, be much facilitated if we were willing to contemplate proceedingsomewhat further in the direction of modifying preferences than in that of reducing tariffs. .He felt that the suggestion of a 5 per cent, floor for preferences would bedifficult for the United States to accept, but he would report it home for considera-tion. Should we wish for power to go up to the floor ? We replied that we couldnot commit ourselves on this, but had so far envisaged only existing preferences..He enquired whether we regarded the possible steps we had provisionallyenvisaged in regard to both tariffs and preferences as being necessarily the finalsteps in regard to these two matters. We said that we did not think this wasnecessarily implied.On our (iii), Mr. Hawkins deprecated the extension of preference to state trading or quotas; if the principle, which would be difficult for the United states to accept, were admitted, some definite limitations should set to the extent of its use.  We observed that quota preferences were not a novelty.3. Export Taxes.American proposal.Export taxes should not be protective.Our comment.We enquired why protective export taxes were not to be treated on the same footing as protective import duties. Why should industries, e.g., in our Coloniesprocessing a raw material produced there, be left without defence againstattempts by importing countries to take over the processing under cover ofprotection of their own? There might need to be an &quot;infant industries&quot;exception for export taxes, as for import duties.Mr. Hawkins, in reply, admitted the logic of treating export taxes in thesame way as import duties, while observing that protective export taxes might beregarded as conflicting with the objective of &quot; access on equal terms to rawmaterials.&quot;4. Special Quota Restrictions.American proposal.This is new : its effect is that for the first 5 years of operation of theConvention, if it is found that in consequence of the tariff reductions imports are coming in in such quantities as to cause or threaten serious damage to domestic producers, the imports may be limited, but not to less than the correspondingimports in a previous representative period. This could be done unilaterally bythe country concerned during the first 5 years, but afterwards it could onlyapply or continue such restrictions after consulting the main supplying countries and with the approval of the International Trade Organisation.Our comments.While not denying the justification for such a clause, we expressed the fear that it might be used by the United States virtually to nullify the effect of hertariff reductions for the first five years. The crucial question was &quot; Does theUnited States want more imports %&apos;&apos;Mr. Hawkins replied that there was at present much more support than ever before in United States public opinion, irrespective of party, for a lower tariff,though this opinion might swing back again with the return of peace. this special quota clause had been inserted to reassure those who might fear that theUnited States Government were tying their hands in face of risks of possible
catastrophe. Administration of the provision would rest in the hands of theExecutive, who would see to it that it was only used to deal with grave emergency.The United States Trade Agreements contained many such escape clauses, butthe Executive had successfully resisted their use (he submitted in writing evidencesupplied by the State Department confirming this statement).Section C. Quantitative Regulation.A merican proposals.In general, the use of import and export prohibitions and restrictions wouldbe prohibited.This would, however, be subject to a number of exceptions, temporary and permanent.The chief temporary or quasi-temporary exceptions would be    &apos;(a) Under the special quota restrictions described in 4 above.   .(b) In relation to exchange restrictions maintained during the first 5 yearsof operation of the Convention (see Section D below, exchange control).(c) In the transition period, restrictions would be permitted for the efficient use of shipping and in connection with allocation of products in short supply and with the liquidation of Government surplus stores.The chief permanent exceptions would be for (d) Restrictions connected with commodity agreements approved by aninternational authority.(e) Restrictions imposed by a country when confronted with balance ofpayments difficulties (see Section D (d) (i) below).(/) Restrictions imposed upon imports from a &quot;scarce currency&quot; country(see Section D (d) (ii)).:(g) Restrictions imposed, in connection with domestic measures operating toregulate the production, market supply, quality or price of like home-produced articles. This exception corresponds to one in the UnitedStates-United Kingdom Trade Agreement of 1938, but in the present draft Convention it is hedged with certain new provisos, viz., that thecountry imposing such restrictions must take measures towards theirtermination, and must notify the International Trade Organisationand consult it each year on their retention.The principle of non-discrimination is, in general, to govern the applicationof the exceptions, and particularly those lettered (b) and (g) above, but not (/).(As to the American conception of the significance of &quot; non-discrimination,&quot; see chapter III below.) .Our comments.As regards proposal (g) above, to allow restrictions in conjunction withdomestic measures, we indicated that, while we might regard such an exceptionas desirable in connection with food-stuffs entering into international trade (ameasure for which provision was made in our new proposals described in chapter II below), the suggestion as it stood seemed to open up too wide a loopholefor the imposition of restrictions on other kinds of goods.(As to the exchange control points, see Section D below, and as to non-discrimination, see Chapter III. As to preference under quotas, see Section B above.)Section D. *Eocchange Control.A merican proposals.(a) There is, in general, to be no restriction on payments in connection with commercial transactions. , -* .(b) However, exchange restrictions in operation when the Convention comes into force can be maintained for 5 years, subject to the following provisos : *(i) exchange must be provided to pay for all permitted imports (so as toavoid new blocked balances);(ii) there must be no discrimination, and no clearings or discriminatorycurrency practices.[29263] - &apos;c 2  .  /; -
(c) As regards blocked balances arising from the war, arrangements forliquidating these must be approved by the International Trade Organisation.(d) Permanent exceptions are provided for (i) restrictions when a country satisfies the Monetary Fund that it isconfronted with balance of payments difficulties;- (ii) restrictions against . a  &quot;scarce  currency&quot;  pursuant to  the  draftMonetary Fund Agreement.The rule of non-discrimination would apply to (d) (i) but not (d) (ii). Somepartial relaxation of this rule might be permissible under (c) (war-time blockedbalances).    &apos;Our comments.We questioned the advisability of including exchange clauses in aCommercial Convention, if the Monetary Fund were in existence. We pointedout that the present proposals went in various respects beyond those of the draftMonetary Fund Agreement (which had been the subject of very careful consulta-tion between the United States and United Kingdom Delegations at BrettomWoods), as follows : (1) The present proposals would only allow exchange control to be maintained for 5 years, whereas the Monetary Fund Agreement would allow it tobe continued for longer in certain circumstances.(2) Blocked balances were not dealt with in the Monetary Fund Agreement,and it seemed inappropriate to give the International trade organisation jurisdiction over them.(3) The provision that if exchange control were maintained in the transition period it must be non-discriminatory, and exchange mustbe provided for all permitted imports, was more rigid than the transition provisions (Article XIV) of the Monetary Fund Agreement.Differences (2) and (3), we emphasised, raised crucial difficulties for us.As to (2), we could not foresee the possibility within any measurable periodof converting our accrued sterling liabilities into free currencies. Theseliabilities were a war-time accumulation, and we could only look to their beingtaken up over a long period as claims against this country&apos;s future production.As to (3), it would be essential for this country in the early post-war period to import great quantities of food and raw materials; having regard to the acutebalance of payments problem with which we should then be faced, we should hope to buy these to a considerable extent from sterling countries against payment in sterling, but no guarantee could be given that this sterling would be convertibleinto other currencies.In these circumstances we could not possibly observe any rigid rule of non-discrimination as regards the liquidation of the so-called &apos;&apos; blocked sterling balances,&quot; nor a requirement that we must not in future build up any freshblocked balances. These consequences flowed inevitably from the facts of ourposition, which was not paralleled by that of any other country.Moreover, as it was generally known that this country alone is substantiallya debtor in respect of &quot;blocked balances,&quot; any provision on this subject in theConvention would be regarded as aimed in reality at us alone, and would therefore create grave difficulty with public opinion here.Further, we pointed out that a rigid rule of non-discrimination in the transition period would operate as a severe and widespread restriction upon the revival of international trade. This country and many others would in that periodbe faced with the problem of &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; currencies. Thus, e.g., ifwe lacked dollars for the purchase of Californian oranges, the rule of non-discrimination would forbid us to buy any oranges even from &quot; soft currency &quot;sources. Thus much mutually beneficial trade would be lost, without any counter-balancing practical advantage to any country, but in deference only to atheoretical principle. It did not appear possible to go further than to provide that in the transition&apos; period the principle of non-discrimination should be observed as far as possible. Mr. Hawkins undertook to report our views to washington; he noted that in the matter of exchange restrictions we should notbe prepared to go beyond the provisions of the Draft Monetary Fund Agreement(apart from the &quot;balance of payments&quot; exception (d) (i) above). He urged,however, that every endeavour should be used to avoid possible accusations of discriminatory action in these respects, since serious friction between business interests-in the two countries might result.  As regards the &quot; blocked balances,&quot;
he enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to examineprivately with the United States Government, outside the discussions on thisConvention, possible means for liquidating them. He was informed that, if sucha suggestion were formally made, we felt that Ministers might be disposed toconsider it.Section E. State Trading.American Proposals.(a) These first laid down the general principle of &quot; equality of treatment &quot;under State trading, purchases and sales to be governed solely by &quot; commercial considerations &quot; (as in Article 8 of the United States-United Kingdom trade agreement of 1938. For American views on the interpretation of this principle,see Chapter III below on &quot; Non-Discrimination &quot;).Next, they drew a distinction between countries with complete State tradingsystems and countries having only State monopolies for particular products. Thereason for this distinction was that in the case of single-product monopolies ina country otherwise employing the free enterprise system, it was thought thatprovisions limiting the degree of permitted protection or price-raising could tosome extent be effectively applied, whereas this would not be true, e.g., of SovietRussia, where prices and costs are artificial.   Thus *(5) In the case of countries having a complete State-trading system, provisionfor expansion of their external trade would be made by their&apos;agreeing to importnot less than a stated aggregate amount, to be laid down in the Convention, fromthe rest of the world as a whole.(c) As regards single-product monopolies, these are not to give greaterprotection to home production than the other provisions of the Convention would permit; thus, e.g., if there were a switch from pre-war tariffs to State purchase,the margin by which the monopoly could raise the price charged to consumersabove that paid to foreign suppliers must not exceed the 1939 tariff rate asreduced under the provisions of Section B 1 above. Where there was a monopolypre-war, this margin would be reduced in the same way as tariff rates.id) All these provisions would apply to the long-term, not the transition period.Our comments.We observed (cp. vi of Section B 1 above, in our comments on the tariffproposals and Mr. Hawkins&apos; replies) that provision did not appear to be made forcases where pre-war protection was afforded by quotas without any import duty,as, e.g., bacon and mutton in the United Kingdom, and that importance might beattached to this.  Mr. Hawkins replied on the same lines as before.We questioned the effectiveness of the proposal ((b) above) that completeState-trading countries should be required to purchase a specified aggregateamount from the rest of the world. Mr. Hawkins admitted that personally hewas inclined&apos; to share our doubts. (As to preferences under State Trading see section B 2 above. As regards the United Kingdom bulk purchase contracts,see Chapter III below on &quot; Non-Discrimination.&quot;)Section F. Subsidies.A merican proposals.These, Mr. Hawkins explained, were of a particularly tentative kind.(a) Export subsidies and two-price systems (involving export at less thanthe comparable price charged in the home market) are prohibited :this rule to be applied not later than three years from the end of&quot; hostilities.(b) Domestic subsidies are not prohibited, but a report must be made to theInternational Trade Organisation oh any new or increased subsidiesapplied since 1939 and on steps to render them unnecessary.(c) However, neither (a) nor (&amp;) are to apply to any product of which theappropriate international organisation has declared a burdensomeworld surplus to exist, which can only be dealt with by international agreement. Any country which subsidises such a product will consult with other important producer and consumer countries with a viewto increased consumption and diversion away from uneconomic pro-duction, and will seek international agreement about the product.
(I) Customs Unions.The test of what is a Customs Union would be whether or not there is acommon Customs frontier. An exception from the rule of most-favoured-nation treatment between member States (see Section A above) is provided for CustomsUnions.However, (1) proposals for new Customs Unions must be approved by theInternational Trade Organisation; (2) the new common tariff of the Union mustnot be higher than the average of the previous tariffs of the members; (3) noCustoms Union is permitted between a member State and a territory dependenton it.Our Comments.(i) We drew attention to an illogicality in the American proposals : while these would prohibit a new Customs Union between e.g., France and Indo-China(so that the present reciprocal free-entry arrangements would fall to be treatedas preferences), they would sanction, e.g., the existing Customs Unions between france and Algeria, and between the United States and Hawaii. Moreover, if France were to incorporate Indo-China politically as part of France (as she has done with Algeria) the intentions of the proposals would be evaded.(ii) We pointed out that, as regards existing arrangements, the problemof deciding what is and what is not a preference will only arise if the attempt is made to reduce preference margins as such. Thus under the American pro-posals for dealing with Preferences (see Section B 2 above), the problem of defini-tion would not arise if their proposals (b) and (c) were eliminated and only (a)retained, as (with a further modification) we had tentatively suggested.(iii) The. American proposal (3) would involve international enquiry intodelicate political questions.Mr. Hawkins in reply recognised that the subject was difficult and neededfurther reflection. He pointed out, however, that proposals for new CustomsUnions are apt to raise political issues, and if the member States of the Inter-national Trade Organisation are to adopt a common attitude towards such proposals, there would need to be provision for the Organisation to approvethem (possibly in consultation with the international political organisation).Our Comments. -(i) As regards (a); we drew attention to the United States export subsidies to cotton and wheat, which seemed to us inconsistent with the intentions ofArticle VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement.(ii) We pointed out that (c) would set up a pressure to conclude international commodity agreements (the United States cotton subsidy furnished an actualinstance of the way in which such pressure might be brought). In general, weexpressed strong misgivings about international commodity regulation agree-ments, fearing that in practice they would tend to favour producers againstconsumers, and not yet having seen an actual example which effectively provided the safeguards discussed at Washington, viz. : (1) equal representation of con-suming and producing countries and (2)&apos;a gradual shift from high-cost to low-costsources of supply.Mr. Hawkins&apos; reply. As to (i), the United States Administration wereconscious of the inconsistency. Generally their feeling was adverse to export subsidies of all kinds, but American public opinion needed education in thismatter. As .to the cotton subsidy, the Surplus Property Disposal Act underwhich this is given has a life -of three years. The last part of the american proposal (a) would provide an indirect saver for the Act, but this would give time for American opinion to be won over to the elimination of two-price systems.For further discussion of (ii), see Annex II below, on &quot; Commodity Policy.&quot;&quot; Section G. General Exceptions.A merican proposals.Only two of these are of special interest, viz., those dealing with (I) CustomsUnions, and (II) relations with non-member States.
(II) Relations with non-Member States..A merican proposal. &apos;No member State adhering to the multilateral commercial convention shall extend its benefits to any non-adherent State, except with the concurrence of theInternational Trade Organisation.Our Comments.(i) If the Convention emerged in- a form which any member of the BritishCommonwealth was not prepared to accept, we should be placed in a positionof the utmost difficulty and the whole question of our attitude towards the Con-vention would have to be reconsidered. This difficulty would, of course, be specially acute if member countries were required to withhold the benefits ofthe Convention from non-members.(ii) There was a difference between refusing non-members the right to enjoy the benefits, and withholding the actual benefits from them. For the latter pur-pose, the benefits would have to be precisely determined: this would present no particular difficulty in the case of tariffs, but would be difficult as regards,e.g., quotas and subsidies.(iii) Any requirement that the benefits must be withheld from non-members might apparently involve that, e.g., we should have to refuse a quota-allocation to a non-member country even though it were a very valuable source of supply to us.(iv) We raised the question of the treatment of&apos; the present enemy states under the Convention.Mr. Hawkins replied: As to (i), he recognised our difficulty. Personallyhe thought it might be necessary to draw up beforehand a list of the countries whose -adherence to the Convention would be necessary for it to come into force.On the other hand, if member countries were allowed unconditionally to extend the benefits of the Convention to non-members, the inducement for the latter to adhere would be greatly weakened.As to (ii) and (iii), he was disposed to agree that any rule ought not to be toorigid. On tills wliolc, however, he felt that the American proposal represented the best compromise on this difficult question,As regards (iv), it appears that the American draft Convention makes no provision, but that they are still in favour of the proposal discussed at Wash-ington, viz., that the ex-enemy countries should be invited to adhere to theConvention, but if they did not accept the invitation, they might be compelled to adhere. (This is similar to the solution generally favoured in our talks with.Dominion and Indian officials in March 1944 see A.S.D. (44) 16, page 13, para-graph 54.)Chapter II. Our Special Proposals regarding Food-stuffs.1. As decided by the War Cabinet on the 22nd November last (W.M. (44)153rd Conclusions, paragraph 4), we put forward, tentatively and provisionally,the possibility of certain special provisions to cover food-stuffs for the types whichenter into international trade. The suggestions which we outlined were on thegeneral lines indicated in the Chancellor of the Exchequers memorandum W.P.(44) 661, as modified by the War Cabinet decision already referred to. Inparticular, no mention was made of the percentages or figures named in W.P. (44)661, these being replaced by.symbols.2. By way of preface, we indicated the reasons Tor not regarding theproposals on general commercial policy discussed at Washington in the autumn of1943 as affording a solution for the special problems of agriculture, either in thiscountry or elsewhere, particularly in that they would fail to provide the neededmeasure of stability. We also gave reasons for considering that neither tariffsnor subsidies would be universally adequate or suitable instruments for achieving the objects in view. These objects appeared to call for a measure of planning inadvance to meet estimated demand, particularly as regards livestock products,dairy products and fruit these being perishable products, for which moreoverthis country is in many cases almost the sole world market. Further, the neededstability could not be afforded either for our home farmers or for our regularoverseas suppliers unless we were able to regulate the supply to this market of the products in question.
Generally, we indicated that, if only for social reasons, no country could afford to let its agriculture decay beyond a certain point as the result of inter-national competition.Accordingly we put forward our proposals as a means of achieving for agriculture a measure of orderly expansion.3.&apos; These proposals, we explained, were devised on the basis of the principlethat any guarantee of prices or income to producers, whether in exporting orimporting countries, of food-stuffs of types which enter into international trade,,should be related to a prescribed level of production and should.be subject tocertain limits.   , - -Their general lines were as follows : (i) No method of affording protection to producers of food-stuffs of typeswhich enter into, international trade, whether it takes the form of tariffs, levies or quantitative regulation imposed under private orState trading, should be. used to a degree which would raise the priceof any food to domestic consumers, on a moving average over a periodof years, by more than a per cent, above the world level,(ii) If a country&apos;s production of any group of food-stuffs of types whichenter into international trade, calculated as a moving average over a given number of years, exceeded by more than y per cent, a givenlevel say the average level of the same country&apos;s production during a given number of pre-war years then that country would be obliged,gradually to reduce the degree of protection or&quot; financial assistance given to its producers.(iii) The financial assistance referred to in  (ii)   would  include directExchequer subsidies but not subsidies which affect a whole range of commodities (e.g., subsidies for drainage or lime).(iv) Exceptions to the rules under (i) and (ii) would be allowed : -&apos; (a) Where a shift in a country&apos;s agricultural production is desirable(1) in the interests of nutrition, or (2) for the purpose of achieving a better balanced agriculture, e.g., by the avoidance of monoculture. (An exception of this sort would be referredto the International Trade Organisation, acting in consultationwith the Food and Agriculture Organisation.)(b) Where it is appropriate to use quantitative regulation or subsidies for balance of payments reasons.(v) The principle of non-discrimination (subject to the degree of imperial preference  eventually  agreed as permissible under the proposed- general Commercial Convention) would be accepted.4. Mr. Hawkins took note of these proposals, for reference to Washington.As was to be expected, neither he nor his colleagues (who included Mr. LoydSteere, the Agricultural Attache at the American Embassy) there and thencommitted themselves to any general attitude either of acceptance or rejection of them.   Their personal reaction, however, appeared in general to be favourable.5. They addressed to us certain questions, both on their own initiative inthe first instance, and subsequently on instructions received from the state department after preliminary consideration. These questions, they explained,were solely for elucidation and were not to be regarded as implying criticisms.In general, these questions admitted of ready answer within the framework of theproposals as they stood, and for the most part neither they nor such comments asthe American officials offered appeared to suggest any need for substantial recon-sideration of this framework. Mention should, however, be made of a few of thepoints raised : (a) They asked whether we contemplated bringing agricultural rawmaterials or tobacco within the scope of the proposals.We replied in the negative.(&amp;) With regard to the proposed datum level of production, under (ii) of theproposals, they suggested that some flexibility would need to beallowed to meet, e.g., changes in population and other factors affectingparticular countries.We pointed out that provision is already made for some flexi-bility under (iv) (a) of the proposals.
(c) They felt that the determination of the world price level might presenta difficulty under the proposals, and suggested that means ought to besought for securing reasonable stability of the world price level., We&apos; suggested that the provision for adopting moving averages,both of prices arid of actual production levels, should go some way tomeet this&apos; point.-(d) They asked how the degree of reduction of protection or financial assist-ance would be determined, if the production target were exceeded.We replied that the method followed would have to be empirical,the protection or assistance being &quot; tailed off&quot; till productionreturned to the prescribed level.(e) They asked whether we envisaged provisions for the elimination of export subsidies on the products which would be subject to our proposals:We replied that, on the one hand, it would be possible to apply the suggested general rule to export subsidies so that any such subsidygiven by an exporting country Would be related to its permitteddatum line of production: if this datum were exceeded, export subsidies would have to be reduced along with the other permittedtypes of inducement; On the other hand, the general rules of theConvention would prohibit direct export subsidies, and it might bethat this general rule should apply also to food-stuffs. We undertook to consider the point further;6: - The American officials drew attention to the difficulty of forming a judgment in the United States without being able to attach to the symbolsemployed in our proposals (&quot;X,&quot; the ceiling for protection, and &quot; Y,&quot; the produce-lion datum) some approximate indication of the values we had iii mind. Wewere precluded by our instructions from naming any such values, and were diilyable to indicate in a general&apos;way that, in our conception, they would be of suchan order as not to conflict with the general tenor and standards of the Convention;Chapter III.-Non^Disgrimination.li We discussed this question with Mr. Hawkins on the basis of the noteforming Annex II to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum ;P. (44) 661&quot;, which was approved by the War Cabinet on the 22nd November last(W.M. (44) 153rd Conclusions, paragraph 4, conclusion (2)).2. The ensuing discussion indicated a substantial measure of agreementbetween the two sides on the following general propositions : (i) In general, no rigid rules seemed possible to ensure &apos;&apos; non-discrimina-tion &apos;&apos; in relation either to quotas or State-trading which would be both fair in all circumstances and also capable of precise application in practice.(ii) The term &quot;commercial considerations&quot; could legitimately be inter-preted in the sense that in placing long-term contracts, a State pur-chasing organisation is entitled to have regard, not solely to such considerations as ldwness of price; it may also, owing to the size ofits operations, be under an implicit obligation not to switch toorapidly from one source of supply to another. In particular,Mr. Hawkins accepted the view that, both under quotas and state trading, &quot;commercial considerations&quot; would permit a large importingcountry to have regard to well-established arrangements with itsnormal suppliers for meeting the special needs of its market, notwith-standing occasional low-priced offers from other sources,(iii) When importing countries negotiate with supplying countries and reachspecific agreement on specific questions, this could normally beregarded as superior to and over-riding any general rule for securing&quot;non-discrimination,&quot; whether relating to quotas or State trading.-   [29263] d
(iv) Both in allocating shares in quotas and in placing orders under.state trading, the most equitable procedure would seem to be that regard should in the first place be paid to the shares of the trade enjoyed bythe various supplying countries in a past representative period, butaccount should then be taken of any &apos;&apos; commercial considerations &apos;&apos;which were to an important degree unrepresented in the base period.But in the absence of consultation as under (iii), any important devia-tion from the base period might justifiably be regarded with suspicion.United Kingdom Bulk Ptirchase Contracts. .3. A discussion, attended by representatives of the Ministry of Food, washeld to elucidate the apparent misgivings of the Americans about these contracts,and to offer them any needful explanations. Mr. Hawkins explained that their basic fear was that long-term contracts for supply from particular sources might in time lead to discrimination against other sources, especially if (1) they were of such term that they continued into the period when supplies had once morebecome adequate; (2) if they provided for the purchase of total exportable sur-pluses. Contracts of the latter type, in particular, would tend to create vested interests concerned to perpetuate them. Such contracts might not necessarily inall cases work markedly to our own financial disadvantage, but they might debarother countries from the opportunity to compete.In replying, we handed to the Americans a summary statement of the contracts concluded by the Ministry of Food. We pointed out that these contractscovered the anticipated period of shortage only, and were generally based on thecycle necessary to restore pjxdj^tuon^^contracts was normally four yearsTthose for^ba^onTeggs^ahd sugar were normallyfor two years. Moreover, the contracts were generally for quantities of thevarious products less than those which we obtained from the countries concernedbefore the war. The Canadian bacon contract was an exception to this, but the bacon situation was, of course, special through Denmark having dropped out.The Americans expressed particular misgivings about bacon. They feltthat we over-estimated the probable period of shortage, and feared that we shouldbe under strong pressure from Canada to continue the contracts in the futureon a larger scale than her competitive ability would justify. We replied that canada had kept us supplied under difficult circumstances during the war and could reasonably ask for time to make orderly adjustment afterwards.In general, we maintained that the facts set out in the paper handed to the americans showed that our action was not inconsistent with the broad principles for the avoidance of &quot; discrimination &quot; which had been discussed (see 2 above).It appeared to be generally accepted that the important point was that other potential suppliers should be brought into consultation when the time came to renew the contracts (see 2 (iii) above).ANNEX II.COMMODITY POLICY.(1) Historical Background.Before indicating the results of the discussions with Mr. Hawkins, it maybe convenient to summarise the main ideas that emerged from previous discussions on this subject with Dominion and American officials.(2) The Washington Agreed Statement.This Statement followed fairly closely in most essential respects certain proposals which the United Kingdom officials submitted to the United states officials at the discussions held in Washington in the autumn of 1943. Theseproposals were based on a paper (R.P. (43) 12) which had, after some consultationwith Dominion and Indian officials, been generally approved by United Kingdom
Ministers beforehand as a basis for discussion. The full text of the WashingtonAgreed Statement will be found in Paper A.S.D. (44) 16, page 50 et sea.., and alsoin W.P. (43) 559 (Revise) on page 37 et seq., with a covering report by the UnitedKingdom officials on page 33 et seq. Its main points may be briefly summarisedas follows : In the first place, the Statement proposed four primary objectives for inter-national commodity policy as follows : (a) The mitigation of violent short-term price fluctuations.(b) A system which would not only achieve (a) but would help to counteractbusiness cycles.(c) In general, a state of affairs under which price adjustments would followchanges in the basic conditions of supply and demand and in whichthere would be increasing opportunities for supplying worldrequirements from countries able to furnish such requirements most effectively.(d) Provision for special action on an international basis which may benecessary in cases where there is persistent disequilibrium betweensupply and demand, for the protection of producers and the facilitationof orderly change during the transitional periods in which adjust-ments of production to effective demand are being made, particularlyin those cases in which the national Governments have taken or might take independent action to support their producers.Provision was also made for the setting up of an International CommodityOrganisation &quot; charged with the responsibility for reviewing, supervising and.co-ordinating international commodity arrangements of all kinds and where necessary initiating them.&quot; The Organisation would help to form such arrange-ments and would review them and report to Governments on them before theywere concluded. It would also review and report on existing commodity agreements. The Organisation would have a General Executive which would beempowered to establish or approve individual commodity organisations for particular commodities. The latter organisations were to be &quot; ancillary &quot; to themain Organisation; it would be a fundamental principle of their constitutionthat &apos;&apos; countries largely dependent upon imports for supplies of the commodityconcerned should have a combined vote equal to the exporting countries.&quot;Buffer Stocks.As regards buffer stocks, it was recommended that the applicability of these in practice to particular commodities should be further studied. The object ofsuch buffer stocks would be &quot;to moderate excessive short-term fluctuations abouta long-term equilibrium price.&quot;Regulation A agreements.As regards international agreements involving quantitative regulation, it wasagreed that these should be regarded as transitory measures to be introducedonly to deal with cases of persistent disequilibrium between supply and demand.In this connection a certain difference in emphasis was noted between theviews of the United Kingdom and the United States sides; the former hoping that normally it would be possible as regards most commodities to allow long-termprice trends to follow supply and demand, thus furnishing the chief means foradjusting production to demand. The United States group, however, felt thatresort to quantitative regulation schemes might be necessary more often than wehad envisaged, so as to avoid transitional hardships to producers and to facilitateorderly change.Four further general principles were agreed to govern any regulation agree-ments that might be established.   These were as follows : &apos;(1) Arrangements to ensure that on any body which, under the aegis of theGeneral Executive, is charged with the duty of framing and/oroperating a quantitative regulation scheme there should be equalvoting power between exporting countries and countries largely dependent on imports.(2) It shall be incumbent upon the General Executive, when any proposals are made to it for the introduction of a quantitative regulation scheme,to explore (in so far as it has not already done, so) the possibility ofdealing with the root causes of the disequilibrium between supply and[29263] E
demand which have given rise to proposals for such a scheme before it endorses the formal introduction of any arrangements involvingquantitative-regulation, other than the introduction of provisionalexport quotas.- (3) Specific provision must be made in connection with any scheme involvingquantitative restriction which is approved by the General Executive&apos;- for ensuring that there are increasing opportunities (which shouldbe applied as far as possible during the period of the scheme) for supplying world requirements from countries able to furnish such requirements most effectively, with appropriate adjustments in prices to changes in the basic conditions of production and demand, and for measures designed to facilitate any adjustments in production whichmay be requisite to this end.(4) No quantitative regulation scheme should be approved for a period ofmore than five years. No such scheme should be renewed except uponendorsement by the General Executive following the consideration bythat body of a report (which should be published) showing how far thepreceding principles, and in particular those at (3) above, had been observed during the initial period of operation of the scheme.As regards subsidies, there was again a difference of view between theUnited Kingdom and United States groups. The latter felt it necessary that countries (whether exporting or deficit countries) which used subsidies in respectof any primary product should set a quantitative limit to the amount of subsidisedproduction. The United Kingdom group were not prepared to accept such a limitation, though they recognised that subsidies should be moderate in amount.The question was left over for further consideration.(3) Dominion Views.The &quot;Washington Statement was discussed with officials of the Dominions andIndia in March 1944. (There had been some discussion with them at an earlier stage in the autumn of 1942 of our original proposals before these were discussed with the Americans.) At the discussions in March 1944 (for a full account, see A.S.D. (44) 16, page 15 et seq.) the general view of the Dominion and indian officials was that the Washington document would confer undesirablywide powers on the International Commodity Organisation in relation both to individual commodity controls and to Governments. The function of theOrganisation should, in their view, in the main be confined to reviewing and reporting to Governments on particular schemes; in regard to the bodiesresponsible for individual commodities, the central organisation would receiveperiodical reports from these bodies, but should not interfere with their day-to-dayoperations.Another suggestion which found favour was that the Governing Body of theinternational commodity organisation should be identical with the general council administering the Convention on commercial policy.(4) Discussion with Mr. Hawkins.Mr. Hawkins explained that the work done by the Americans since theWashington discussions had not substantially departed from the conclusions ofthe Agreed Statement, but only elaborated them.A. Questions of Organisation.(1) Nature of the International Commodity Organisation. On the questionwhether there should be an independent International Commodity organisation or whether this should be part of the International Trade Organisation, amajority view on the American Sub-Committee of officials which had been considering the subject favoured the latter alternative, as tending to ensure thatthere would not be a bias in favour of producers and that all interests and aspectsshould be duly considered. A minority, however, favoured an independentcommodity organisation.(2) Relations Between the Central Organisation and Individual CommodityBodies. Following the line emerging from the&quot;Dominion talks in March 1944,we urged that objections would be likely to be raised against giving the central
commodity organisation executive powers, and we suggested that a rather looserrelationship between the central organisation and the bodies dealing withparticular commodities than had originally been contemplated, might be likelyto find greater favour. We also suggested that there was need for the individualcommodity, bodies to contain a substantial element of practical representation,drawn from persons well versed in the trade concerned. Mr. Hawkins did not dissent from this view, but felt that this element should not dominate the organisations.(3) Code of Principles. Both sides were disposed to agree that the general principles suggested in the Washington Agreed Statement (both as regards the primary objectives of commodity policy and as regards the principles proposed to govern regulation schemes) were on the right lines, though it was pointed out thatthe suggested principle of equal voting power for consuming and exporting countries might be hard to interpret; it was recognised that this question called for further study.(4) Position of this Country in International Commodity Discussions. Particularly as regards commodities of which this country is the main importer,we expressed the misgiving that the suggested principle of equal voting rightsmight not in practice safeguard our position in international discussions againstthe combined pressure of producing countries. Such a danger was not present when we ourselves conduct negotiations with our suppliers, but the balance in aninternational discussion would tend to be weighted against us. Mr. Hawkinsthought that our position could be adequately safeguarded under the proposedrules.B. Questions of Method.(1) Buffer Stocks. Discussion took place on the status of the method ofbuffer stocks in the complex of suggestions which had been discussed earlier. this method had not been advocated as the sole desirable method, nor had we arguedfor the total exclusion of quantitative regulation agreements. However, we feltthat the latter needed to be carefully hedged by the acceptance of a suitablecode- of principles. A particularly important principle in this connection wasthat of requiring gradual change from high cost to low cost sources of supply.(2) Transition Difficulties.-hx the early post-war period, we pointed out,the position of many commodities would be highly abnormal. Great cautionwould be needed in placing heavy responsibilities upon any international com-commodity organisation in its early stages, and much discretion would be needed in seeking to deal with special post-war situations on the basis of any general code of principles.Mr. Hawkins feared that if individual commodities were dealt with outsidesome international organisation, bad habits might be formed. He agreed, how-ever, on the need for flexibility, particularly in the early stages. Those handlingurgent problems affecting particular commodities should be required to consult with the International Organisation.(3) Finance of Buffer Stocks. It was noted that scepticism was felt invarious quarters as to the feasibility of international buffer stocks. These doubtscentred largely around the question of finance. From our side the view was expressed (and not contested by Mr. Hawkins) that the time was probably notyet ripe for inviting consuming interests to share with producing interests theburden of financing buffer stocks. Both sides were disposed to agree that thisquestion of financing should be examined by the International Organisation whenset up.(4) Need of a General Code. It was agreed that the central desideratum inregard to commodity policy was a generally accepted code of principles, to which any method that might be adopted in particular cases would have to conform.ANNEX  III.CARTEL POLICY.1.   American Proposals.The Americans,, while still formally putting forward the very drasticproposals on this subject which they made in the Washington discussions of 1943,viz., for the registration of all private international business agreements and theprohibition of all normal types of &quot; cartel practices,&quot; showed signs of a much
more moderate attitude. They said that it would be a big step forward if wecould say that we were at one with the Americans in condemning bad thoughunspecified cartel practices and would undertake to take all practicable means toprevent the continuance of such private agreements as we agreed were frustratingthe intentions of the proposed international Commercial Convention.2. &apos; Standpoint taken up by the United Kingdom officials.This followed the line approved by Ministers at the Reconstruction Com-mittee meeting of the 29th January (R. (45) 18). The United Kingdom officialsindicated that their observations (as in the discussions on other subjects) were ofa non-committal character. -&apos;They began by calling the American officials&apos; attention to paragraph 54 ofthe White Paper on Employment Policy, as a general indication of the Govern-menfs policy in the matter of internal restrictive practices. This marked adefinite new departure for this country. At the same time, the view taken here wasthat private industrial agreements, including those features of them which theAmerican proposals would prohibit, were not always or necessarily contrary tothe general interest. The&quot; prohibitions suggested by the Americans seemedunsuitable and probably impracticable for application in this country or in othercountries generally.Any legislation adopted here on the basis of the Employment White paper would, of course, have to be determined later by Parliament: but if machineryfor enquiry into domestic restrictive practices were set up, this could be used to investigate also international cartels to which British firms were parties.The United&apos; Kingdom officials then put forward the following tentativeideas: (1) A consultative body might be set up forming part of the international trade Organisation, to receive complaints that the proposed Inter-national Commercial&quot; Convention was being frustrated by privateagreements of an international character;(2) if there appeared to be a case for enquiry, member States would them-selves make enquiries into complaints against activities of their nationals and inform the consultative body;(3) this body would have no powers of making direct investigations and nojudicial or executive powers; reliance would be placed on consultationto secure conformity with the purposes of the Commercial Convention.The United Kingdom officials went on to express the view that a procedure of this character would not only be more acceptable to public opinion here than asystem of prohibitions, but would also probably be more effective.3.   Discussion.In the ensuing discussion, the American officials chiefly stressed the risk thatinter-Governmental agreements for the general welfare (and particularly theproposed International Commercial Convention) could be frustrated by privateagreements : they urged that, just as the Convention would bind the participating governments, so it should be a binding obligation on them to prevent private interests from frustrating its objects. They stated that the matter would beregarded as of high importance by American public opinion.Our representatives observed that a virtual moral obligation on Govern-ments to take such steps as were open to them to prevent such frustrating action was implicit in our proposal for international consultation, but pointed out thatcompulsive action would not necessarily in many cases have the desired (or indeed any) effect.The Americans, however, continued to press for some form of obligationin the matter, even if conditional and limited. They thought that it might perhapssuffice if there were an undertaking on the part of Governments adhering to theInternational Commercial Convention, e.g. : &quot; To take such measures as are practicable after consultation with theInternational Trade Organisation to bring about the discontinuance of practices which were found (by the Government against which complaintwas made) to be frustrating the Convention.&quot;This suggestion was reserved for further consideration by both sides.
