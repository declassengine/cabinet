(45) 132.3rd March, 1945. - jWAR CABINET.SUPPLIES FOR THE CHANNEL ISLANDS.Joint Memorandum by the FIome Secretary and the Minister of State.A detailed report has now been received from the Delegates of the Inter-national Red Cross Committee who visited the Channel Islands at the end ofDecember and conferred with the local British civil authorities and the german military authorities. As was indicated in response to a Question in parliament on the 22nd February, this information has been carefully studied by the^Depart-ments concerned with a view to seeing whether any further steps should be takento alleviate the hardships under which the Islanders are suffering.2. It is clear from the report that the shortage of food supplies for the civilians is becoming increasingly acute as local stocks run out; and the GermanCommander left the International Red Cross Delegates in no doubt that though he would do his best for the civil population the needs of the German garrisonwould take first place. The Island authorities have formally requested the red cross Delegates to bring to the notice of the International Red Cross Committeethe tragic situation of the civil population as a result of the German policy.The supplies already sent to civilians through the Red Cross have not, however,been used by the Germans for their garrison.3. The International Red Cross Delegates have reported that the minimumneeds per month of the Islands in foodstuffs and soap are : Flour      ............ ... 500 tonsYeast      ...       ...       ...       ... ...        ? tonStandard Red Cross Food Parcels ...      62,000 (about 360 tons)Sugar     ...      ...       ...       ... ...      18 tonsSalt        ......&apos;....... ...       12 tonsSoap       ...      ...      ...      ... ...        8 tons.The Insular civil authorities have asked for certain other food supplies but theMinistry of Health advise that the minimum quantities given above should besufficient for immediate heeds if the local production of vegetables and dairyproduce can be maintained. The report states that after the end of January itwould be necessary for the, Islanders to consume the seed potatoes intended forthe 1945 season and ,a request has been made by Guernsey for 500 tons of seed potatoes, and by Jersey and Guernsey for some 12 tons of miscellaneous seedsfor growing crops for human consumption and cattle foodstuffs. The Ministryof Health advise that provided 500 tons of flour are sent each month it shouldnot be necessary for the Islanders to consume their stocks of seed potatoes, andin view of the acute shipping position it is not proposed to send seed potatoes.In view of the importance of maintaining the dairy produce and the herds ofthe Islands, and the additional strain that would be placed on shippino- intransporting foodstuffs later when the Islands are liberated, or in shipping dliiry,produce if the herds are killed off, it is proposed that the small amount of niiscel-laneous seeds required (other&apos;than seed potatoes) should be sent.4. The provision of medical supplies and of reasonable quantities of clothino-and footwear is proceeding.[29353]-
5. The minimum requirements of fuel as given by the Red Cross are3,000 tons of gas coal per month together with a single consignment of 200 tonsof coke. This can, it is understood, be made available&apos;. The agreement of theGermans to the despatch of coal by a neutral collier travelling between Lisbonand the Islands is awaited. In the meantime we have proposed to the Germanst-hat use should be made of a Swedish vessel of 1,000 tons carrying capacity atpresent in the Baltic. This is the only suitable vessel at present available; it willsatisfy less than 50 per cent, of the stated minimum needs, but in view of theshipping position it is proposed to put her in service-if the Germans agree, andto defer for the time being the question of a further collier.6. A small quantity of miscellaneous technical- supplies and equipmenthas been requested by the local civil authorities for water, electricity and gasproduction installations.  It is proposed that these supplies should be sent.7. To comply with the&apos; suggestions made by the. International Red cross committee does not involve any departure from the policy already approved bythe War Cabinet and we should be glad to obtain the approval of the War Cabinetto the proposals made in this memorandum, and in particular to the despatch of18 tons of sugar, 12 tons of miscellaneous seeds and a comparatively small tonnageof miscellaneous technical supplies and equipment for public utility services.H. M.R. K. L.3rd March, 1945.
