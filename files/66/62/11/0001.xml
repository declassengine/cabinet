naval SITUATION.General Review.*1.   U.S. ships have supported further landings in Luzon.Southern Japan has been attacked by U.S. carrier-borne aircraft.Two U-boats have been sunk, three probably sunk and two possibly sunk.Two of H.M. corvettes have been sunk by U-boats and a sloop torpedoed.Northern Waters.2. On the 17th H.M. ships Lark (sloop) and Bluebell (corvette) were torpedoed off Kola Inlet while escorting a convoy homeward-bound from north russia. Lark was taken in tow by a Russian tug. - Bluebell sank : 12 of the ship&apos;scompany were rescued. On the 20th the convoy was attacked by 25 torpedo-carrying Ju. 88 but no damage was caused either to the convoy or to fourstragglers. One of the enemy was shot down by ship&apos;s gunfire and two othersby carrier-borne fighters.3. On the 15th four of H.M. destroyers evacuated 500 civilians from thepopulation on Soroy Island which had been harassed by a number of smallGerman ships. .Home Waters.4. On the 15th three L.C.A.&apos;s, covered by four support landing craft, landedcommando troops near the Zeriksee Canal on the island of Schouwen. Anotherlanding, which met heavy opposition, was made at Dussen, north of the Maas.On the 18th a second raiding party landed from two L.C.A.&apos;s.5. On the 20th H.M.S. Vervain (corvette), while escorting a homeward-bound convoy, was sunk by a U-boat south of Waterford : three officers and30 ratings were rescued.6. There has been considerable E-boat activity during the week. On the night of the 17th/18th H.M.S. Sheldrake&apos; (corvette) intercepted and drove off a group of boats east of Southwold. On the night of the 21st/22nd a large forceoperated against the Thames-Scheldt convoy route. Aircraft, including navalSwordfish, made repeated attacks on the enemy and subsequently our patrolsfought a series of inconclusive actions. On the following night ten E-boats were attacked by coastal forces after being reported and shadowed by aircraft.7. During the week ending the 18th, the combined British and U.S.discharges through the liberated ports Were 57,000 men, 10,200 vehicles, 420,000tons of stores, 72,000 tons of petrol and 72,500 tons of ammunition.Mediterranean.8. On the night of the 17th/ 18th M.T.B.&apos;s shelled Karlobagi (northernYugoslavia) and fired torpedoes into the harbour : shore batteries inflicted slight damage and caused one casualty.9. Allied warships have continued to shell&quot; enemy positions on the French-Italian frontier.10. During the week ending the 10th, daily discharges through the ports of Ancona and Leghorn averaged 3,760 tons and 6,140 tons respectively.East Indies.11. Coastal forces and landing craft, supported by H.M. Indian sloopsNarbada and Jumna, have operated during the week in the inland waterwaysbetween Akyab and Ramree Island.H.M. destroyers Pathfinder and Paladin in company with light forces and landing craft east of Ramree have supported the Army and have prevented the escape of Japanese from the Island. Twelve laden enemy craft have been sunk and 65 Japanese killed. On the 11th, eight aircraft attacked the force and caused damage to H.M.S. Pathfinder by a near miss.12. H.M. S/M Tantivy sank a tug and two coasters in tow off the coast ofSumatra on the 3rd. ......
Pacific.13. The two battleship-carriers Ise and Hyuga from Singapore were sighted on several occasions during the week, proceeding northward. weather conditions prevented aircraft making an attack on them.Philippines.14. On the 13th TJ.S. forces occupied Cavite naval base in Manila Bay.On the same day U.S. cruisers and destroyers bombarded shore defences atCorregidor and covered minesweeping operations at the entrance to the Baywithout opposition. The bombardment continued on the following day whenenemy return fire resulted in damage to two destroyers and a minesweeper. a landing was made on the 16th (see &quot; Military Situation&quot;).On the 15th a heavy bombardment preceded a landing on the tip of theBataan Peninsula where the landing craft met little resistance.At Manila and Cavite some 8&quot; and 6&quot; naval guns, a 3&quot; battery and tenseaplanes were captured in serviceable condition.On the night of the 15th/16th, Japanese coastal forces sank three U.S.landing craft near Manila and caused damage to a fourth.Japan.15. On the 16th and 17th a very large U.S. carrier force operating off thesouth coast of Honshu flew off a series of aircraft to attack airfields and other targets in southern Japan and shipping off the coast. Details have not yet beenreceived of the damage inflicted.Anti-Submarine Operations.16- Thirty-one attacks were reported during the week, of which 24 were by warships and 7 by shore-based aircraft.One U-boat was sunk by the 10th escort group on the 14th north of the shetlands. Another was sunk by H.M. ships Lark (sloop) and Alnwick Castle(corvette) on the 17th N.E. of Kola Inlet previous to the torpedoing of H.M.S. Lark(see paragraph 2). One Was probably sunk by H.M. S/M Venturer off theNorwegian coast, another by the 9th escort group off the Moray Firth and a thirdwhich had previously sunk H.M.S. Vervain, by H.M. sloops Amethyst andPeacock, south of Waterford. Two U-boats were possibly sunk by an aircraftwest of the Hebrides and by the 10th escort group.north of the Shetlands.Enemy Intelligence.17. Reconnaissances on the 21st showed an incomplete Elbing destroyer at hamburg, which had arrived since the 10th, and a small floating dock at Ijmuiden,which had arrived since the 16th.U-boats.18. The number of U-boats on patrol in coastal waters of the United.Kingdom is estimated to be about 50 per cent, above the average figure for january.At Hamburg 37 U-boats were sighted on the 21st including four or five ofthe large prefabricated boats.It is estimated that three pens of the old shelter at Ijmuiden are still usable :these could shelter more than 50 midgets or three E-boats. Five pens of the newshelter are reported to be ready : these could give unprotected accommodation to60 midgets and torpedoes.Fresh details of the Seehund midget indicate that, if properly handled, itcould be an effective weapon. Unlike the Biber it is well designed and equipped.It would seem to be a miniature of the new pre-fabricated 200/250-ton U-boat.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. Four ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boat during theweek, of which three are known to have sunk.A U.S. ship in convoy to the United Kingdom was sunk off Kola Inlet, and anIcelandic ship in convoy to Iceland (C) was sunk in the Irish Sea. A tanker was sunk and a U.S. ship.torpedoed in eastbound convoy off Gibraltar.A ship in coastal convoy was damaged, probably by mine, off. the Humber. a turkish ship was mined in the Black Sea.Two ship&apos;s in coastal convoy were sunk by E-boats north of Cromer.[29279] B
Allied Minelaying.20. Surface craft have laid mines in Home Waters. Aircraft have laidmines in the Baltic, the Kattegat and off the Norwegian and German North Seacoasts.British and U.S. aircraft have laid mines off the coast of Burma and in theStrait of Malacca. A large number of mines has also been laid by U.S. aircraft in Singapore Strait and off the coast of Cochin China.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.21. E-boats may have laid mines off the S.E. coast on one night and two large groups operated on the convoy route to Antwerp on another night.Forty-seven of the mines laid by aircraft in the Scheldt approaches on the23rd January have been destroyed.The Boulogne-Dieppe channel closed since the 9th January was re-opened onthe 18th February.Minesweepers hindered by weather, obstructions and enemy shell fire, haveswept a four-mile bombardment channel north of Leghorn.Thirteen mines have been destroyed off the north Dalmatian coast. - Up tothe present 50 mines have been destroyed in the Piraeus area and 178 in the DoroChannel.   U.S. minesweepers have destroyed 170 mines in Manila Bay.The mine totals are 6,363 ground and 8,888 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.22. The tonnage of transports which have reached Denmark from southern norway during the two weeks ending the 17th is estimated to total 100,000.Russian Merchant Shipping.23. Thirty-four Finnish ships, totalling 74,117 tons, are to be handedover to the Russians. These include the Kronoborg (8,287 tons), the Bore X(5,058 tons), the Atlanta (4,936 tons) and the Nagu (3,393 tons).. In additiontwo icebreakers, two small tankers, 26 tugs, 15 motor-lighters and 20 smallpassenger craft are to be taken over.British Contraband Control.24. In December, British patrols in the Strait of Gibraltar boarded117 ships. Of the 67 ships which were examined at the contraband control base,40 were Spanish. The control passed 3,263 tons of food-stuffs, 121 tons of tobacco and 7,881 tons of raw products destined for Switzerland.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.25. While U.S. Forces have maintained pressure in the areas ofEchternach and Prum which has resulted in small but steady gains, British and canadian troops of the First Canadian Army have continued to attack againstmounting resistance between the Maas and the Rhine.Except for an attack by Seventh Army in the area of Sarreguemines, therehas been little to report from the front of the Southern Group of Armies, where local regrouping is taking place as a result of the successful action to clear thewest bank of the Rhine.Southern Sector.26. On the 17th, the Seventh U.S. Army attacked.on a 10-mile frontbetween Sarreguemines and Forbach. They have since advanced nearly 4 miles,outflanking Forbach on the east&quot;, and forward troops have entered the south and eastern outskirts of the town where heavy fighting has taken place.Central Sector.27. Throughout the week, Third U.S. Army have continued to make steady progress north and south from the areas west of Echternach and Prum. Thissteady  compression  of  the  enemy&apos;s  salient  must  be  causing  him  some
uneasiness as he has lost the protection of the Siegfried line which has beenbreached in both these sectors. Further south, an attack to the S.E. of Remmich,which was launched on the 19th, has resulted in gains of up to 4 miles on an-mile front.Northern Sector.28. Severe flooding has continued to hamper operations by the FirstCanadian Army in the area S.E. of Nijmegen, and enemy resistance has greatlyincreased. Nevertheless, Afferden was reached on the 17th, and by the 19th, theimportant communication centre of Goch had been captured, with forward troops a mile to the south of Calcar. The southern bank of the Rhine has been cleared to a point opposite Emmerich.Russian Front.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)East Prussia.29. The ring round the Germans in East Prussia continues slowly to tightenin spite of very stiff resistance by the German forces.Central Sector.30. The area between Chojnice and Graudenz has been a focal point of.fierce fighting this week.- On the 15th, Chojnice, on the main Danzig-Stettinrailway was captured. The Russians strengthened their break-through attemptstowards Danzig and Gdynia, and were stubbornly counter-attacked by theGermans, but in spite of this Graudenz was encircled on the 18th.In Pomerania the encircled town of Schneidemuhl fell on the 14th. Therehas been heavy fighting in the Arnswalde areas but no substantial Russianprogress. East and N.E, of Berlin, the Germans report the narrowing down of Russian bridgeheads, the existence of which has not yet been confirmed bythe Russians.&quot;Russian advances continue west of the Middle Oder, from east of Guben toS.W. of Breslau. Sagan was captured on the 17th, and the River Bober has beencrossed on a wide front. The ground has been fiercely contested by the Germanswho have claimed several successful counter-thrusts. The Germans are howeverstill holding out in two fortress towns on the R. Oder, Glogau and Breslau; the escape-from the latter town was ultimately closed on the 17th.Southern Sector.31. It is believed that about 4-5 divisions were destroyed in the Budapestfighting; an attempt by the garrison to break out to the N.W. was largelyfrustrated, although the Germans claim that several &apos;&apos; battle groups &apos;&apos; succeeded in reaching their lines.East.of Komarno the Germans have attacked the Russian bridgehead overthe River Hron, south of Zvolen with some success, and on the 19th, claimed to have penetrated deep into the Russian positions on the north bank of the danube. On the other hand, they report that the fighting between Lake Balatonand the Danube ceased on the 17th, with very heavy losses inflicted on the russians in six weeks fighting.Burma.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)32.   Opposition on Ramree Island ceased on the 16th.On the 15th, a column of our troops advancing from the Minbya area linked up with our troops fighting around Kangaw, whilst another column outflankedKangaw and reached the coast 13 miles to the S.E. On the 16th, our forceseffected a landing on the Arakan coast dues west of An, achieving completesurprise and encountering little opposition.Pakokku was entered on the 18th, and reported clear of enemy on the &apos;21st.Opposition is being encountered in the vicinity of the village of Seikpyu.Thirty miles west of Mandalay our bridgehead across the Irrawaddy hasbeen enlarged and several Japanese counter-attacks have been repulsed. Acolumn from our bridgehead at Thabeikkyin is advancing down the East bankof the Irrawaddy towards our bridgehead at Kyaukmyaung, which has been reinforced with tanks. , &apos;,   &quot;. [29279] . . -    B 2-
In northern Burma, our bridgehead across the Shweli River, 13 miles N.W.of Mong Mit, was heavily attacked on the 17th. The Japanese were supportedby heavy artillery and using many flame-throwers, they were able to penetrateour perimeter. Later the enemy were thrown back during a spirited battalioncounter-attack involving hand-to-hand fighting.   Over 350 Japanese were killed.Approaching from both sides of the town, Chinese troops captured Hsenwiduring the night 18th/19ths against light opposition.Pacific.Philippines. - .33. Luzon-In Manila, the Japanese still hold the area immediately southof the mouth of the river which flows through the centre of the city, where fiercestreet fighting continues; resistance is also being encountered from isolatedpositions on the outskirts of Manila. The Americans, however, have now gainedcomplete control of the neck of land between Manila Bay and Laguna De Bay, thelarge Lake S.E. of Manila.On the 15th, TJ.S. troops from Subic Bay landed at Mariveles, on the southerncoast of the Bataan Peninsula, against negligible opposition. These troops havenow joined hands with further U.S. forces advancing down the east coast ofBataan, and the Bataan campaign therefore is virtually completed.On the 16th, U.S. troops carried out a sea and airborne landing on the island of Corregidor, and now control most of the island.Japanese casualties up to the 18th amount to 38,115 killed and 361 prisoners.Kazan Islands.34. On the 19th, the 4th and 5th U.S. Marine Divisions landed on Iwo Jima(670 miles south of Tokyo and 625 miles north of Saipan). The landings werepreceded by a very heavy bombardment ps of the Pacific Fleet, and bycarrier and land-based aircraft. The U.S. Forces have now captured, the first ofthe three airfields and hold an area extending from a beachhead 1\ miles long onthe eastern coast to a strip one mile long on the Western coast, thus cutting offthe Suribachi Volcano, in the southern tip of the island. The Japanese are putting up most stubborn and desperate resistance, and have launched counter-attacks supported by tanks.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.35. Fighter Command flew 49 defensive sorties. Attacks against long-range rocket sites are referred to in .para. 37, while details of enemy rocketactivity against this country are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and home security,&quot;Home Waters.36. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 736 sorties; one aircraft is missing.In attacks on shipping off South Norway by Halifaxes two ships of 3,000and 5,000 tons were left in flames. Off the east coast of Norway, Mosquitoes left a 500-ton ship on fire and damaged a 2,000-ton ship.Aircraft of Bomber Command laid 402 sea-mines.Western Europe.37. During the week ended dawn on the 21st, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air)Hew 11,785 sorties and dropped 5,989 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawnon the 22nd, aircraft of Bomber Command and U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew9,951 sorties and dropped 22,379 tons. U.S. VIII Fighter Command and fighter command flew 2,726 and 715 sorties respectively. Sixty-seven enemy aircraft were destroyed. Of 175 Allied aircraft which are missing, only 22 are heavy bombers.1 The tonnage of bombs dropped during the week completed a total of over1,000,000 tons dropped on Germany (including Austria and Czechoslovakia) sincethe beginning of the war.,
Adverse weather restricted operations over the battle area, particularly inthe northern sector; on five days no sorties were flown in this sector. night operations by, heavy bombers were curtailed; Bomber Command operated in strength on two nights and attacked one target four times by day. U.S.VIII Bomber Command operated in strength on six days; attacks were made against targets on the Eastern Front in support of the Russian offensive, oil plants and railways in Germany, and a communication centre in the northernsector of the Western Front. The majority of the attacks were made by pathfindertechnique with unobserved results.On the 15th, 685 Fortresses (part- of a force of 1,137 heavy bombersdespatched) attacked Dresden and Cottbus, following the heavy attack on theformer city on the previous day and night. Over 1,300 tons were dropped; no opposition was experienced over Dresden.A total of nearly 3,600 tons was dropped in 12 attacks on 7 railway centreseast of the Rhine, between Rheine and Frankfurt, including one attack on Hamm,when 534 tons were dropped. Reconnaissance photographs of Hamm show a concentration of at least 500 bursts across the yards and direct hits on many maininstallations.Of a large force despatched to attack targets at Nuremberg, 831 aircraftdropped 1,879 tons through cloud on the main station and railway yards; 360 air-craft abandoned the task owing to unfavourable weather over France. This citywas attacked on the following day, when 2,558 tons (including 1,051 tons of incen-diaries) were dropped mainly by pathfinder technique. About 2,300 tons were dropped on 9 oil or benzol plants in the Ruhr, and in north-west and centralGermany. Results of two attacks which were observed, namely those atNordstern (275 tons) and Dortmund (462 tons), were good. Reconnaissancephotographs of Dortmund show direct hits on two coking plants and power stations. Aircraft providing escort for these attacks destroyed 252 locomotives,also 19 enemy aircraft in combat and 47 on the ground.Strong night attacks were made by Bomber Command aircraft against oil plants at Bohlen (965 tons), Reisholz and Monheim (near Dusseldorf 673 tons).The attack on Bohlen was scattered due to cloud and a smoke screen; reports ofthe other attacks were of cloud conditions, but fires and explosions were seen. the towns of Dortmund (2,239 tons), Duisburg (1,649 tons) and Worms (937 tons)were also attacked. On Dortmund the bomb load included over 1,400 tons ofincendiaries. Good fires were seen through 8/10ths cloud at 5,000 feet. In the attacks on the two latter targets it is reported that the bombing was concentratedand fires were seen. The Mittelland Canal at Gravenhorst was attacked; 811 tonsof delayed action bombs being dropped on accurate marking; results are not yet available.Six attacks were made by Allied heavy bombers against the communicationcentre of Wesel, on the Rhine south of Cleve (2,200 tons). One was made in clearweather when 418 tons were dropped by Lancasters and one attack was abandoneddue to bad weather.  Reconnaissance reports show very severe damage.Mosquitoes made several attacks on Berlin and other targets.Medium bombers of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) operated mostly against communica-tions and airfields in the. central sector, and rail centres and barracks in thesouthern sector. Fighters and fighter-bombers continued to provide support and to harass enemy movements. Operations were possible on two days only onthe northern sector, when communications over a wide area were attacked. Onthe southern and central sectors operations were restricted on some days. On allsectors approximately 1,000 M.T., 200 locomotives and 2,500 rolling-stock were destroyed.In small attacks hits were obtained on long-range rocket sites and their communications in Holland.Aircraft of Fighter Command on sweeps and patrol over Norway and SouthGermany destroyed a small number of enemy aircraft in combat&apos; and somelocomotives.The G.A.F. fighter opposition to day attacks was slight and on some daysnil; against night attacks it was approximately 30/100 aircraft. When weatherpermitted tactical fighter sorties amounted to 50/75.Southern Europe.38. In the week ended dawn on the 20th aircraft of M.A.A.F, flew12,342 sorties (including 5,242 by heavy bombers) andr dropped 9,694 tons of bombs. Six enemy aircraft were destroyed; 82 Allied aircraft are missing(including 43 heavy bombers).   Aircraft of the Strategic Air Force operated
in strength on six days against railways, oil plants and ordnance depots un austria and Yugoslavia and harbours in Italy and Yugoslavia. In Austria,strong attacks were made on a number of railway centres and oil plants in the vienna area. Over 2,800 tons were dropped on these targets and the resultsreported were fair to good. Strong attacks were made on other railway targetsincluding Linz, Graz, Klagenfurt and 5 railway centres on the Brenner route from Bolzano to Rosenheim. Over 1,100 sorties were flown against these targets and 2,500 tons dropped.Excellent results were reported after an attack on an airfield at Regensburgwhen about 500 tons were dropped. The harbour and shipyards at Fiume were attacked four times (651 tons) and those at Trieste thrice (627 tons). Theresults on the former were good and a large. explosion and fires were causedat the naval docks at Trieste.The Tactical Air Force continued attacks (when weather permitted) on enemy communications in Northern Italy and on the Brenner route, severalbridges and a power station were destroyed and many other bridges damaged;fires were started in a sugar factory. A small number of locomotives, rolling-stock and M.T. were destroyed.In Yugoslavia, the railway centres at Maribor .and Zagreb were attacked by heavy bombers.Small attacks were also made by aircraft of the Balkan Air Force againstcommunications in the Maribor and Celje areas, oil installations south-east ofZagreb, and gun positions on Lussin and Rab Islands. Attacks were also madeon gun positions on Milo (^aegean).[Note, Appendices VII and VIII give Raid Assessments and Opera-tional Statistics.]Russia.39-.* With improved weather conditions the Russian Air Force was fairlyactive on the East Prussian sector of the Front, and supported the advances ofthe troops under Marshal Koniev. Operations were carried out against enemyattempts to supply by air the German formations encircled in the Breslau area.Long-range bombers operated against Stettin, Stargard and Breslau.The G.A.F. effort was not on a large scale nor commensurate with the forces available, the main effort was against the Oder bridgeheads.Far East.Burma and Siam.40. During the week ended dawn on the 20th, Allied aircraft flew2,914 sorties, of which-2,231 were by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition,Dakota transport aircraft flew 5,817 sorties, carrying 4,469 men and 8,341 tons,and light transport aircraft flew 2,142 sorties, carrying 682 men and evacuating107 casualties and 431 men.  Five Allied aircraft are missing.In the Arakan, Central Burma and North Shan States close support for land forces continued to be given by fighters and fighter-bombers. Enemy positions,airfields, stores and communications were attacked and many buildings, a numberof bridges and river-craft were destroyed or damaged. -Liberators, in well concentrated bombing, dropped 223 tons on villagesW. of Kyaukse (25 miles S. of Mandalay), and others started many fires whenattacking Yenangyaung (130 miles S.W. of Mandalay 195 tons). Numeroushits were obtained by heavy bombers on the runways of Aungban, Kunlon, Leweand Pyinmana airfields.In Lower Burma, Liberators destroyed and damaged several bridges on theMoulmein/Ye and the Burma/Siam railways. Shipping was successfully attacked in the Gulf of Martaban, where a number of small vessels was damaged by Beaufighters.   Liberators laid sea-mines in Moulmein and Mergui harbours.In Siam a direct hit was obtained by bombers on the centre of the mainbridge at Kanchanaburi, the by-pass bridge being destroyed at the same time.Small-scale attacks by Liberators were twice made on shipping off theAndamans, several vessels being sunk or damaged.Japan.41. A force of 98 Super Fortresses dropped 262 tons on the industrial area at Nagoya, one target being the Mitsubishi aircnaft engine factory.   Bombing
was mainly through thick cloud, but where results could be seen they werreported as excellent. One bomber was missing from this operation. Later inthe week over 300 tons were dropped by 135 Super Fortresses which bombed an aircraft factory at Musashmo and the dock and urban areas of Tokyo Path-finder technique was used, but several fires were seen near the Tokyo dockslnere Was some air opposition on this occasion and 21 enemy aircraft were destroyed and 20 probably destroyed in combat, for the loss of 4 bombers42. In the Philippines, gun positions,&quot; enemy concentrations and other targetson Corregidor and the Bataan Peninsula were attacked on a number of. occasions,over 300 sorties being flown by Liberators. Extensive damage and many firesresulted.  Medium bombers sank several troop-laden barges leaving Manila.In the Kazan Group, airfields, radar and radio stations and other targetson Iwo Jima were several times bombed by Liberators. Other Liberators attackedtargets in the Ogasawara Group.In the Celebes, among targets attacked were the mica mines at Banggai,bombed by Liberators, a radar station on Manoei Island and shipping off the coast.Heavy and medium bombers operated against enemy positions and villagesnear Wewak in New Guinea, while in Borneo airfields at Balikpapan and Miriwere bombed by heavies.The scale of activity in New Britain, New Ireland and Bougainville con-tinued on a high level, 550 sorties being flown. Airfields, supply areas and other targets near Rabaul were effectively attacked. In the Carolines Allied aircraft operated against a number of targets, including Babelthuap.In Formosa, road and rail communications and an airfield were successfully attacked by fighters and medium bombers, while Liberators bombed an aluminiumfactory, a railway centre and other targets in the Takao area.43.

A largemulti-bay building in the railway workshop area has been partially destroyed and, to the south of the town centre, many industrial premises have been hit andat least six severely damaged.Dortmund. Photographs, to some extent obscured by smoke and haze, taken on the 16th February after the 8th Air Force attack earlier in the day, show considerable damage centred round the power station and coking plant ofHoesch A.G.The chemical installations of the Minster Stein coke oven plant were alsohit during this attack and were still on fire some two hours afterwards. Bothbatteries of coke-ovens have suffered heavily and will probably be incapable of operation for at least a month. There is considerable residential damage in thevicinity of this plant.[29279] 1 c
Additional photographs taken on the 19th February show that Eighth U.S.Air Force attack on the 16th February has caused considerable damage in themain sorting sidings (adjacent to the phosphate plant) of the Eving railway centre. All tracks have been cut and more than 30 wagons have been derailed(12 of them being wrecked). Some tracks toward the northern converging points of the main sorting sidings have, also been cut and a small goods yard in thevicinity has suffered damage.&apos; Photographs also show damage in the Harpenerweg oil refinery^ in theLangondreer district of Dortmund, which was attacked by the Eighth Air force on the same day. A long high building has been severely damaged and the boiler house to a lesser degree, while three of the six &quot; dug in &quot; storage tanks havebeen destroyed- . Some &quot;rail tracks in the sidings have been cut and about seventank wagons have&apos; been derailed.   The refinery appears to be inactive.Dresden. Photographs taken on the 14th February, following the heavy attack by aircraft of Bomber Command on the 13th-14th and the smaller daylight attack by the U.S.A.A.F. on the 14th, are largely obscured by smoke from thelarge number of fires still burning. In the parts of the city visible, however,great material damage can be seen, notably in the main railway yard and neigh-bouring industrial premises. Elsewhere, many blocks pf buildings are seen to be gutted&apos;and one small gap in the haze shows an. area of devastation in thesouthern part of the city.The railway yard was attacked on two previous occasions by the U.S.A.A.F.,on the 7th October, 1944, and on the 16th January, 1945. Photographic cover,obtained immediately after the second attack, was marred by smoke and snow,and though considerable damage was seen to have been caused in the railwayyard and many incidents in the town area, no exact statement on damage waspossible:Further photographs, this time of poor quality, taken on the 15th February,after the attacks by Bomber Command and the 8th Air Force, cover astrip of the city from east to west across the centre east of the railway yards,and also part of the north-eastern suburbs. Interpretation is rendered difficult by the&quot; haze from fires still burning more than&quot; 36 hours after the lastattack. Within the limits visible, however, large areas of devastation can beseen and these include the heart of the city, Alstadt on the south bank of theElbe, Neustadt on the north bank and a further large area east of Alstadt, and north of the Grosser Garten. Scattered and in places severe incidents of residen-tial damage can be seen east of this area as far as the suburb of Loschwitz.Within these areas damage to public and administrative buildings is very heavy and includes: The Law Courts, Land Gericht, Carola Ministerien(containing the Ministries of Justice, Finance and Culture), Rathaus, Landes-finanzamt, Central Market Hall, Slaughterhouse, Schloss, Palace andAlbertinum. A number of unidentified industrial buildings, some of which were still on fire, have been affected.One of the main railway stations has been damaged and two of the bridgesacross the river, the Carola bridge and the Augustus bridge, have both been hit.Hamm. Photographs taken shortly after the 8th Air Force attack on the16th February show severe fresh damage to the railway yard and facilities.   The-heaviest damage has been caused in the eastbound sorting sidings, where almost every track has been cut, at least once, and a quantity of rolling-stock damaged and derailed. A second concentration of craters, immediately south of the passenger station, has inflicted damage on railway facilities and cut most of thetracks.   The station itself, which is partially obscured by smoke, has received at&quot;least three hits, and the north end of the carriage shed, which had been repairedafter previous damage, has been destroyed. Some wagons in this area have been damaged and derailed.The westbound sorting sidings and the eastbound reception sidings have bothbeen affected and most of the tracks cut: many wagons have also been damaged and derailed here. The western wagon repair shop, previously damaged and almost repaired, has suffered severe fresh damage. In addition a large shopof the Westfalische Draht-Industrie, also previously damaged and partiallyrepaired, has received further damage. There is fresh business and residentialdamage south-east of the passenger station and north of the Westfalische Draht-Industrie, in which areas fires were still burning about two and a half hours afterthe attack. 0Merseburg/Leuna. Photographs taken on the 14th February, covering thesouthern half of the synthetic oil (Bergius) plant, show that further severe damage

Bomber Command attack on the14th-15th January. Numerous important installations were heavily hit, including a paste preparation building, an injector house, a compressor house, and theammonia sulphate house.It is estimated that this attack will have stopped production for at least two months.Recklinghausen/Erkenschwick. The Ewald Fortsetzung coke oven plant was attacked by Bomber Command on the 15th January. Photographs taken onthe 14th February show severe damage, and no activity in the plant.Rositz. Photographs taken on the 17th February show that considerable damage has been caused to the Deutsche petroleum refinery, as a result of the bomber Command attack on the 14th-15th February. While damage is heaviestin the eastern part of the refinery, the west end has also been affected. The cokeand/or asphalt section has been severely damaged and pipe lines in the south-east and north-east distillation plants have been seriously disrupted. A coolingtower and 21 storage tanks have been severely damaged or destroyed, and 14 shedsand stores buildings have suffered in like degree. The refinery is out of action.This target was also attacked by a small force of 8 th Air Force bombers on the7th October, since when no photographic cover has been obtained..Wesel.-Photographs taken during and immediately after the Bomber Com-mand and 8th Air Force attacks on the 16th February are largely smoke obscured,but a number of fires are burning throughout the town mainly from the fullybuilt-up centre towards the southern outskirts. Considerable damage can beseen, but interpretation is rendered impossible by the smoke.Photographs taken on the 14th February after the 8th Air Force attackearlier in the day, show that one span at the west of the road bridge over the rhine has been destroyed and has collapsed into the river. A single track rail-way had been laid across this bridge to supplement the cross-river railway facilities and to provide a reserve railway crossing in the event of the destructionof the neighbouring railway bridge.it
