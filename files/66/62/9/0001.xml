(45) 104.21st February, 1945.WAR CABINET.WORLD ORGANISATION-POSITION OF SOUTHERN IRELAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I feel that I ought to bring to the notice of my colleagues a point arisingfrom the preparations which are being made for the United Nations Conferenceat San Francisco. I understand that it was agreed at the Crimea Conference thata hint should be given to certain neutral nations that, if they wanted to get onthe band-wagon, they must declare war on Germany before the 1st March, andthat, in fact, the United States have already been in touch with a number ofSouth American countries, while we are approaching Egypt and Turkey, and may possibly also give a hint to Portugal. The question arises, should we do the samefor Southern Ireland ? My personal view is that we should not. Although theSouthern Ireland Government has, in fact, helped us in a number of unobtrusiveways (see attached annex), her general policy of neutrality, her refusal to grantus bases and to remove the Axis Legations, and her unsatisfactory attitude overwar criminals, put her quite out of court.At the same time, I feel bound to warn my colleagues that this is a question that may well be raised by one or more Dominion Governments. We have to face the fact that their attitude with regard to Southern Ireland is very different from ours. Instances of this are Canada&apos;s criticisms of the United States and united Kingdom notes on the Axis Missions, as being too severe, and, more recently, the attitude of all Dominions alike on the question of Irish representa-tion on an equality with other members of the Commonwealth at the Montrealand Chicago Conferences. I can only attribute this attitude on the part of theDominions to an obscure feeling that, however ill-judged Southern Ireland&apos;sbehaviour over the war has been, she was entitled, as a Dominion, to stay out, if she thought right. But, whatever the reason, we must, I am afraid, be preparedfor a possible unfavourable reaction from the other Dominion Governments, ifthey consider that she is being worse treated than other neutrals. This does not,however, alter my view that it would be a mistake to take any such special action as is being taken in the case of Egypt and Turkey, both of whom have got rid oftheir Axis representatives, while Egypt has also helped us in many other ways.A possible way out of the difficulty would be for the Prime Minister or theForeign Secretary, in the coming debate in the House of Commons, to include some general sentence to the effect that nations who wish to be invited to the san francisco Conference must take the necessary steps to render themselves eligible.We could then tell the Dominions, if they protested, that Southern Ireland, withthe other nations concerned, had been fairly warned.C.Dominions Office,21st February, 1945.[29266]
ANNEX.    &apos;Note on Facilities obtained from the Government of southern ireland.1. -In general, the Southern Irish Government have been willing to accordus any facilities which would not be regarded as overtly prejudicing their attitudeof neutrality.2.   In particular, the following points may be mentioned : (a) They agreed to our use of Lough Foyle for naval and air purposes.   the ownership of the Lough is disputed, but the Southern Irish authorities-are tacitly not pressing their claim in present conditions and are alsoignoring any flying by our aircraft over the Donegal shore of theLough, which is necessary in certain wind conditions to enable flying boats to take off from the Lough.(b) They have agreed to the use by our aircraft based on Lough Erne of acorridor over Southern Irish territory and territorial waters for thepurpose of flying out to the Atlantic. ;(c) They have arranged for the - immediate, transmission to the UnitedKingdom Representative^ Office in Dublin of reports of submarine.activity received from their coast watching service., ,- v  -(d) They arranged for the broadcasting of reports by -their Air observer corps of. aircraft sighted over or, approaching  Southern  Irish. territory.
