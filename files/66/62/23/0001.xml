THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 118.27th February, 1945.WAR CABINET.ORGANISATION  OE  CIVIL AVIATION.Memorandum by the Minister for Civil Aviation.I have reached full agreement with the Treasury on all the matters whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer wished to reserve for further consideration. Ihave also carried my discussions with all the various parties, whom it isproposed to bring into the operating companies, to a point where a statement ofGovernment policy can be made. It is very desirable that the statement shouldbe made as soon as possible. I think it will be convenient if it takes the form ofa &quot;White Paper; and I attach a draft White Paper for- the approval of the WarCabinet.   (Appendix I.)2. On the operating side, all the interests which I am satisfied can make asubstantial contribution to the efficiency of the new operational companies havereadily agreed to participate under the conditions set out in my memorandum .P. (45) 38. They have not only affirmed their willingness to accept the Govern-ment Plan, but they have expressed full satisfaction with it as a sound andbusinesslike proposal. After many days of discussion with the Railways and shipping lines I am deeply impressed by their keen desire to make a real successof air transport, and I am more than ever convinced that they are essentialpartners in achieving that end.I should add that in the case of the two companies, the United Kingdom-European company and the South American company, where the non-B.O.A.C.elements will be predominant partners, they are not only willing but desirous thatB.O.A.C. should be in the partnership. The future partners are already workingvery satisfactorily together on a number of matters.Similarly on the Empire routes, where B.O.A.C. will predominate, a numberof the shipping lines, whose experience and organisation will be of great value,are desirous to participate and quite content to accept a minority interest.3. It will be convenient if I deal here with the other interests whoseinclusion was left open in my previous paper.(a) I am glad to report that some of the Travel Agencies have agreed toparticipate in the United Kingdom-Europe company. Those Agencieswhich do not feel able to make an investment in the company will notbe prejudiced and will use their organisation to help aviation.(6) The pre-war air line operators, other than Railway Air Services andthe other companies associated with the railways, are unlikely to wishto participate, though they have not given a&quot; definite reply. Thereare only eight of these companies.. They were operators on a small scale and some of them so intermittent in their services as to be border-. line cases, but I thought it was fair to. give them all the same chance.Only one of these companies Allied Airways (Gandar Dower), Ltd. -is operating to-day on behalf of the Air Ministry. Some of these companies took exception to the Government scheme, contending thatafter the war instead of participating as shareholders in the Europeancompany they should be permitted to operate services of their ownselection. They admitted that this would mean abandoning the approved plan for a comprehensive company which would take therough with the smooth. Some of these companies will probably resume[29305] &apos; B
their running of charter aircraft, which I do not propose we shouldrestrict, provided it is a genuine charter business and not acamouflaged regular air service,(c) I have felt some difficulty about the Tramp ship owners. They do notrun regular shipping services and consequently have not the organisa-tion or connections of the regular shipping lines. They cannot supplyreciprocal facilities for air travellers as the Railways and Shipping-Lines can; nor can it be contended that air transport is likely to cutinto the Tramps&apos; business. On the other hand they include firms andmen of initiative in transport some of whom are very keen to take an interest in civil aviation. Their Chairman, Mr. Ropner, assuresme that they would be wholehearted in their co-operation and would accept a very small share whatever the Government decided-ratherthan not come in at all, since they think that they can contribute tomake the business a success; but they would expect a seat on theBoard. The Railways and Short Shipping Lines are opposed to theinclusion of the Tramp owners in the United Kingdom-Europeancompany; and although I am impressed by the business capacity and initiative of some of the individual Tramp owners, it must, I think,be conceded that their qualification to participate as a transportinterest is slender. I have accordingly again consulted the Ministerof War Transport. While he endorses my view as to their businesscapacity and initiative, he considers that their organisation wouldbe of negligible value to air transport. If they were included in theEuropean service it would be unreasonable to exclude them from theLatin American and Empire services where they have a larger seainterest than in Europe and adjacent waters. He feels that if theywere included in any of these services there would be no logical reasonfor excluding other firms of business ability and foreign experiencewho might wish to take an interest in the air. In these circumstances,I think that the balance of argument is against the inclusion of theTramp owners.4. In my previous paper I proposed that the shareholding of B.O.A.C.in the European company, although not a majority holding, should be substantial,because the European company is likely to be the most remunerative of ourundertakings. With this the Chancellor of the Exchequer agrees. In calculating the shareholdings of the various interests I have laid down that although thenew company will be entitled to acquire at a fair valuation from existing airline operators, any physical assets which are needed for its services, no allowanceor issue of shares will be made to participants in respect of goodwill or &quot; develop-ment expenses &quot; previously incurred. The whole of the capital of the EuropeanCompany will thus be represented either by physical assets acquired or cashsubscribed.5. The South American service will be assigned as proposed, to the latin american Shipping Lines with B.O.A.C. holding a minority interest. TheChancellor of the Exchequer proposes that the B.O.A.C. interest in this service should not be large, say no more than 20 per cent.6. On the Empire routes a number of regular shipping lines desire toparticipate with B.O.A.C. On routes where it is agreed that shipping companies should have a share, it will be necessary to form subsidiary companies. Mycolleagues will remember that irrespective of shipping participation, we had considered this would probably be convenient, and would, in any case, be necessarywhenever parallel operation merged in a joint operating company.7. I should only mention one other specific case. It is proposed that theCanadian Steamship Lines, the shipping company of Canadian Pacific Railwaysregistered in this country, should participate in the Atlantic services. Theyare a British liner company and clearly entitled, under our general policy toparticipate. Although they are subsidiary to the main C.P.R. company whichis registered in Canada, more than half the shares in the Canadian company are held in the United Kingdom. They are extremely efficient and have greatair experience as well. I know no shipping company that can make a more valuable contribution. But in view of the attitude which the present canadian government has adopted towards the Canadian Pacific Railways in regardto Canadian air transport, the Dominions Secretary and I agreed that I should
consult the Canadian High Commissioner privately. I am glad to say thatMr. Massey agreed, without hesitation, that the case for the inclusion of the pacific Steamship Lines in the United Kingdom Company was unanswerable andand that their exclusion would be invidious.8. In paragraph 8 of my memorandum W.P. (45) 38, I set out the relation-ship which would obtain between the Government and the operating companies,and the conditions which the companies should, accept, including the approval bythe Minister of the Boards of Directors. All parties have accepted theseconditions.9. The three main operating companies are also in agreement that they shall have a joint training establishment for air crews and ground staff, and ajoint organisation for the overhaul of aircraft. They also agree that the Ministermust be satisfied that the conditions of service shall be those of a &quot; modelemployer,&quot; and, in particular, that special provision shall be made for pilots and other members of air crews for whom ground jobs cannot be found whenthey are past the flying age.10. As regards subsidies, the European and Latin American companiesaccept the position that they shall operate the agreed services without subsidyunless they are faced with highly subsidised competition. They expect to losemoney in the early years. It is impossible to say that we shall be able to avoidsubsidies entirely on these routes. So much depends on the action other countries will take. But, as my colleagues know, it is our intention, whenever we make a reciprocal agreement with a foreign country, to include in such an agreementprovisions both as regards the frequencies of service and the fair division ofsuch frequencies, and also for the fixation of rates. If these agreements worksatisfactorily, the risk of uneconomic competition and consequent claims forsubsidy should be greatly reduced. If a subvention is required it will most conveniently take the form of an adjustment in the terms on which aircraft areleased to the companies, at any rate during the interim period.11. The companies 1 accept the principle that they shall fly british aircraft provided such aircraft can be made available. In this connection I mustagain emphasise the importance of alloting sufficient facilities with competentfirms to speed up the design and production of civil, aircraft as soon as the german war is over.  This is as important to the aircraft industry as it is to the operators.12. In my previous paper I had proposed the creation of a Government-owned company which should have all or some of the following functions : (a) The owning and leasing of aircraft;(5) Directly or through the operating companies responsibility for thetraining of air crews, and the supply of technical and operationalhelp to Commonwealth and foreign countries.(c) Supervision of the welfare of pilots and air crews.(d) The direction of research.(e) The ownership and operation of international airports for internationalservices.13. In agreeing to the general plan the Chancellor of the Exchequerstipulated that he should have the opportunity of giving special consideration tothis proposal. While in full agreement with all the objects which I sought to achieve through the medium of the company, he has advanced cogent reasons whythese can better be accomplished by other means. I must admit the force of these arguments; and the conclusive one is that a company would require legislationwhereas on all of these matters action is required before legislation could become effective. In Appendix II I set out the correspondence between the chancellor and myself on this matter; and I submit that the Chancellors proposals shouldbe substituted for my own.14. I ask the War Cabinet to approve, the application of the plan as set outin this memorandum and to authorise the publication of the proposed white paper (see Appendix I).15. I should inform the War Cabinet that the Board of B.O.A.C. havenotified me that they wish to place their seats on the Board at my disposal at anytime that is convenient. I shall wish to make considerable changes in the Board.But I want further time to make my final selection, and I may not be able tocomplete my list before I leave for South Africa.[29305] b 2
Ariel House, W.C.2,27th February, 1945.* Committee set up under the Prime Ministers directive (W.P. (45) 110).16. I have not dealt in this memorandum or the draft White Paper with government policy with regard to airfields. I know many of my colleagues want to give full consideration to this, and it is impossible to give a complete picture of the airfields which will be required for civilian aviation until we have settledthe routes within the United Kingdom and the terminals and stopping placesalong these routes. We have made good progress with this, and concurrentlyI am preparing, in consultation with other Departments, a provisional list of themost suitable airfields. This involves consultation with the Air Ministry onR.A.P. airfields which can be combined in peace for Service and civil use. Assoon as this work is fq,r enough forward I. will submit proposals to the WarCabinet.* The policy of operation of air services is&quot;entirely independent of the selection and ownership of airfields, and there is therefore no reason why weshould not issue the paper on operation now and announce subsequently theGoverment policy with regard to airfields.S.


BRITISH AIR TRANSPORTPresented by the Minister for Civil Aviationto Parliament by Command of His Majesty,*945LONDONHIS MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY OFFICE
BRITISH AIR transport the General Principles applicable to British Air Transport.In this Paper His Majesty&apos;s Government present their general policy forthe development of British civil air transport and the operation of air routesfor the carriage of passengers, freight and mails.2. In determining policy the field of civil aviation must be viewed as awhole and a plan, to be effective and practical, must cover all routes in which great Britain is interested Commonwealth, foreign and internal.3. The United Kingdom policy on air transport in the international sphere,as set out in the White Paper on &quot; International Air Transport &quot; (Cmd. 6561)and elaborated in the British proposals made at Chicago, was based upon thefundamental principle of order in the air, i.e. the full and fair developmentof air services to meet all requirements coupled with the elimination of waste-. ful and subsidised competition. So- too, our national policy, while it muststimulate and encourage development and initiative, should do so within anordered plan.4. Civil aviation is essentially a transport business. Its problems are inmany ways analogous to those of transport by land and by sea. To make our national air services effective, we must not only draw upon the best of aviation knowledge and skill at our command, but must also make the fullest use of the ripe experience and world-wide organisation which has - been built up over many years by British enterprise and initiative in other forms oftransport. This does not mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard any industry or undertaking as having a vested right to sharejf in civil air transport.The test which has been applied in evolving the plan set out in this Paper is:Where can the best contribution to British air transport be obtained, and howcan it most effectively be used to build up an organisation which will fulfilour public, commercial, and social needs?5. It is fully recognised, not only by His Majesty&apos;s Government but also by those who are concerned in existing methods of transport by land and by sea, that the competition of air services must be met in the air. Our national and Commonwealth interests and, indeed, the interests of the older forms oftransport themselves cannot be served by attempting to- retard or restrictnew methods of carriage. They can best be promoted by creating and fosteringthe most effective air transport system we can develop at home and overseas.6. Air transport is a public service. The criterion as to whether a particu-lar route should be flown is not merely: Is it commercially profitable? Thereare services which are essential in the public interest, but which offer little or no prospect of a direct financial return. Unlimited competition in the airby private operators would mean that competing services would be concen-trated on the remunerative routes; and that the taxpayer, while reaping no benefit from the more lucative routes, would be compelled to support by subsidies those services which, although desirable for public or social reasons,would initially, at any rate, be run at a loss, and might, in some cases, nevershow a profit. On the other hand, if an air transport undertaking is assured of the exclusive right to operate the remunerative services and to developthese to the full, it can -and should accept&apos; the obligation to run theunremunerative services as part&quot; of its general transport system. It is,therefore, a necessary part of the Governments plan, that the undertakings which will be granted the right to run air services both within the United -
Kingdom and between the United Kingdom and other countries, shall possesssuch right within their allotted areas-, to the exclusion of other British air transport operators.y. While in the interests of order and economy, competition in runningregular British air services must be eliminated, there remains a field ofdevelopment which-is open to and will, in the Government&apos;s view, be bestserved and stimulated by the entry of competing operators. Subject to the observance of the necessary safety and navigational requirements, it is not intended to restrict the operation of charter aircraft.Requisites of an Air Transport Organisation.8. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the following are,the requisitesof an efficient air transport organisation: (a) The Units must be large enough to operate economically but not so large or widespread as to preclude effective supervision along every route.(b)- Each Unit must have an efficient organisation covering every areaserved by its air lines to handle passengers, freight and mail, together with first class knowledge and experience of transportation and facilities for full co-operation with other forms of transport wherever this can promoteair travel.(c) Provision must be made for the economical use and maintenance of aircraft.(d) The most effective arrangements must be made for the training ofair crews and ground staff and for their- welfare.(e) There must be close co-operation between the users and the manu-facturers in deciding the types of aircraft to be used.(/) The organisation should be capable of providing training for the crews of Commonwealth or foreign countries, and should also be able to supplythese countries, where required, with technical and operational help.9. Size of Units. The Government are convinced that the policy of asingle chosen instrument, whatever may have been its merits in the past, isunsuited to deal with the great expansion of the future. There must, there-fore, be several air transport undertakings. A single entity, even if it sfbuldeffectively include and use all the varied experience of aviation and trans-portation which it is necessary to bring in, would be too large and far-flungto fulfil the requirement of individual supervision of all the routes operated.Moreover, while as stated above, it is clearly desirable to eliminate wastefulcompetition between British operators on the same route, it is none the lessdesirable both to avoid a sealed pattern of management and operation andto encourage different managements to try out their own ideas. This wouldin no way prevent the constant pooling of experience and the Governmentsplan is designed to secure this.10. Civil Aviation as a Transport Problem. Air transport can be greatlyassisted and stimulated by co-operation with other systems of transport. Tothe solution of the problems which air transport poses British enterprisesalready engaged in other branches of the transport and travel business can,alike with the British Overseas Airways Corporation, bring a /valuable contribution. Their extensive organisation and connections both in the UnitedKingdom and overseas can with great economy of management be used toserve air transport equally with land and sea transport. Through their co-operation, the fullest use can be made of through-bookings, interavailability
of tickets between air and other forms of transport and the most convenientrail and sea connections on all parts of the air routes. It is therefore of the essence of the Government&apos;s plan that British interests concerned in transport by sea and by land should be brought into a real and effective partnership with the organisations which will be responsible for transport by air.ii. Carriage of Mails by Air. The Government has a special interest inthe carriage of mails by air. The Postmaster General is considering, inconsultation with the Minister of Civil Aviation and the undertakings whichwill operate the future British air services, the best and fullest use whichcan be made of those services for the carriage of air mail.12. ,Areas to be served by Separate Units. Much consideration has beengiven to the number of air transport uni.ts which will be most effective, andthe areas which they should cover. In this the Government have had thebenefit of full consultation with the various aviation, transport and travelundertakings which will be brought in as partners in the plan. The Govern -ment haye decided that the most efficient organisation will be obtained bymeans of three main Air Transport Corporations which will be responsiblefor air services in the following areas:(i) The Commonwealth air routes together with the trans-Atlantic service to the United States and the services to China and the Far East.(2) European air routes and the internal services of the United Kingdom.(3) The South American route.13. It is obviously convenient that the same Corporation - which will operate the Commonwealth air service from the United Kingdom to Canada,should also operate the Atlantic service to the United States. When con-ditions permit the inauguration of regular civil air services to China andother parts of the Far East, these will link natur-ally with the Commonwealth&apos; services to India and Australia, and it is desirable that they should be associated with the same Corporation.14. The Government are satisfied that the arguments in favour of unitingin a single Corporation the internal services of the United Kingdom and theservices from the United Kingdom to Europe are overwhelming. While themajority of continental services will focus on London, connections, will berequired from the out-set with other centres of population and industry inthe United Kingdom; and, as air transport develops, services will run direct from some of these centres to the Continent. The same type of aircraft willbe equally suitable for many of the European and internal services; and theeconomical use of such aircraft will be greatly increased if they can be drawn from a pool available for all European and internal services in accordancewith the fluctuating seasonal and other traffic demands on individual routes.15. The trunk route from the United Kingdom to South America presentsa new field for British civil aviation. It is one which our long and close relations with the States of that continent make it essential that we should enter.The Structure of the Corporations.16. Commonwealth and Atlantic Services, The Commonwealth andAtlantic services, together with the ultimate extensions to China and the FarBast, will be assigned[to, the British Overseas Airways Corporation. Thiscorporation and their predecessor; Imperial Airways, have been responsiblefor the development and operation of these routes in the past. They are inclose relations with the corresponding Commonwealth services. They aretherefore clearly the appropriate instrument for the operation and further
1adevelopment of these routes. On many of the routes, however, a valuable contribution can be made by British Shipping Lines with their well-establishedorganisation and local connections, and their experience of the special trans-pore requirement of particular areas served. It is therefore proposed thatthese Shipping Lines shall be afforded the opportunity of becoming associatedwith B.O.A.C. in the operation of those routes to which they can make a useful contribution; an association which is welcomed alike by B.O.A.C. andthe Shipping Lines. It will probably be convenient, in any case, for B.O.A.C.to operate certain of these routes through -subsidiary companies; and as theinterest and organisation of the different Shipping Lines is confined to par-ticular routes,&quot;such a structure will clearly be desirable for those services inwhich British Shipping Lines participate. In any subsidiary companies,the predominant financial and managerial interest will normally be held byB.O.A.C.; but the Shipping Lines will, at their own risk, take a share inthe capital, and their transport experience and commercial - acumen willbe represented on the boards. It is the determination of all the shipping lines which have expressed a desire to participate, as it is of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, that the air routes with which they are to be associated shallbe fully and successfully developed.17. European and Internal Services. The European and Internal UnitedKingdom services will be assigned to a new company in which the participantswill be the Railway Companies, the Short Sea Shipping Lines, the TravelAgencies and B.O.A.C.   In these four groups is concentrated a great wealthof British knowledge and experience of aviation, transport and travel prob-lems.   In addition to their knowledge of United Kingdom and Europeantraffic needs and their extensive organisation here and on&apos; the continent, theRailways have, in the past, successfully operated the great majority of theinternal air services of the United Kingdom.   The Short Sea Shipping Linesoperate and have built up a valuable organisation and goodwill in connectionwith sea routes to Europe; some of them have also been associated with theoperation of air lines in the past.   The Travel Agencies combine a peculiar,knowledge of the needs of the travelling and touring public with a wideorganisation-in this country and throughout the Continent.   All the proposedparticipants are agreed on the importance of B.O.A.C. having its share inthis Corporation.   It will bring to it all its knowledge of aviation and itsexperience of the continental air-routes which its predecessors operated beforethe war.18. Although the great majority of European and internal air services were previously operated by B.O.A.C., the Railway Companies or the ShortSea Shipping Lines, there was a small number of independent British operatorswho ran air lines before the war. All but one of these have been compelledto cease operating during the war, but the Government considered it fair to afford them an opportunity of taking up shares in the new company onthe same terms as the other participants. This offer has not so far beenaccepted. -19. As-stated in paragraph 6 it is an essential part of the Governmentsplan that the new Corporation shall be responsible for all the British air services in its area. Its right to run internal services within the United kingdom will be exclusive. Its services to Europe will be run in parallel or, it is hoped,in some cases in conjunction with the services of other European countries to the United Kingdom. These exclusive rights are clearly necessary to giveeconomical operation and the running of a maximum number of air services.The plan will, therefore, provide for the Corporation to run some services,both in the United Kingdom and in Europe, which will initially be run at a40773 - A 2
)loss and some of which may never show a profit. Services of this kind arenecessary in the public interest and a comprehensive schedule of services willbe settled which will serve the public interest as well as fulfilling purely com-mercial traffic needs.20. By bringing into the Corporation those interests which are concernedwith land and sea travel in the United Kingdom and to Europe, arrangements will be made for interavailability of tickets for the different forms of travelon all stages of the routes, for the use of the existing, offices and agencies ofthe various participants both at home and abroad, and for the most con-venient adjustment of times and frequencies of services in the interest of airtravellers to facilitate through connections with other forms of transport.21.&apos; The European and internal air routes are likely to be more lucrativetha&quot;n some of the Commonwealth routes which are to be assigned to B.O.A.C.as the direct operating corporation. The Government therefore think it right that the financial interest of B.O.A.C. in the new Corporation which will operate the European and internal air routes should be assessed in the lightof this consideration as well as of the technical contribution which it can make to the new Corporation. While it is not proposed that B.O.A.C. shouldhave a majority holding in the new Corporation, it is intended that its interestshould be substantial.22. South American Services.- The South American service will be assigned to a new company in which the -majority participants will be thoseBritish Shipping Lines operating to South America who have associatedtogether for this purpose as British Latin American Airlines Limited. here again it is proposed that B.O.A.C. should participate in the capital and management of the new Corporation, but its share in the capital will be smaller than that which it will receive in the Corporation responsible for the&apos; European and internal services. The British Shipping Lines which have for so many years carried a large proportion of the passengers and trade between Europe and South America and have their wide connections and organisation and their goodwill in the areas to be served iby the new air route are, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, in the best position tomake the service a success. They have expressed their willingness to risktheir own capital in operating the route without subsidy.23. Transfer of Shares in the Air Transport Corporations. The transport and travel organisations which have been invited by the Government toparticipate in the new plan&apos;, have been selected by reason of the positivecontribution which they can make in skill and experience to the new Cor-porations. That they are prepared to invest their own money without any government guarantee is an indication of their belief in the future of civil air transport and an earnest of their intention to operate efficiently; but theyhave not been invited merely as investors. They will take a permanentstake in the enterprise; and the Government has accordingly laid it down that there shall be no transfer of the shares in the capital of the new com-panies which are allotted to the participants. This will apply not only tothe two new main air transport corporations but also to the subsidiary com-panies which may be formed by B.O.A.C. to operate specific Commonwealthor Atlantic routes in which Shipping Lines may participate, and to any othersubsidiary companies which may (be formed by the other main air transportCorporations to operate particular services, such as those to the channel islands or the Isle of Man, where constitutional or other considerations makethe formation of subsidiary companies desirable.
24. Payment for Goodwill. His Majesty&apos;s Government does not regardanyone as having a vested interest in the air. Although the new air transportCorporations will be entitled to acquire at a fair valuation from existing airline operators any physical assets which are needed for the new services,no allowance or issue of shares will be made to participants in respect of goodwill or &quot; development expenses &quot; previously incurred. The whole of thecapital of the ne&quot;w Corporations will thus be represented either by physicalassets acquired or cash subscribed. .Co-operation between the three Air Transport Corporations.25. Overhaul of Aircraft. In order to. ensure the maximum of efficiency and economy, the three Air Transport Corporations will join in the creationand management of a -combined organisation for the overhaul of aircraft.26. Training of Air Crews and Ground Staff. The highest standards ofskill and reliability must be achieved for air crews and ground staff. Forthis purpose the three Corporations will maintain a combined training estaib-lishment at which their flying and technical staffs will be trained, and atwhich refresher courses will be available.27. Recruitment of Staff. The constituent elements of the three Corpora-tions have expressed their keen desire that every possible opportunity shallbe given to officers and men of the Royal Air Force to take service withthe Corporations. Close relations will be maintained with the Air Council,through the Minister for Civil Aviation, in order to give full effect to this intention. It will, however, be appreciated that openings for employment incivil air transport will not be large compared with the war-time strength ofthe Royal Air Force.28. Welfare of Staff. His Majesty&apos;s Government will also make it a con-dition that the terms of service in these Corporations shall be those of a&quot; model employer &quot;; and, in particular, that special provision shall be made,by a suitable contributory scheme, for pilots and other members of air crews,when they are past flying age. The participants in the Corporations haveexpressed their ready assent to this condition. A scheme of this kind, whichwas settled in agreement with the British Air Line Pilots&apos; Association, isalready in operation in the case of B.O.A.C.29. Relation of Minister for Civil Aviation to the Air Transport Corporations.-The appointment of members of the British Overseas Airways corporation will be vested in the Minister for Civil Aviation; and he will also approve the appointment of the representatives of B.O.A.C. on the Boards of theother two main operating companies. The appointments of Directors uponthe Boards of the other two main operating companies will be subject to approval by the Minister, as will the representatives of the Shipping Linesupon the Boards of the subsidiary companies of B.O.A.C. The approval ofthe Minister will also be required to the Memorandum and Articles of association of all the companies, both main and subsidiary, which play apart in the scheme.30. Once the Corporations and subsidiary companies have been established and the members of their Boards appointed or approved by the Minister,as the case may be, it is a cardinal principle of the plan that the corporations and the companies should be responsible for the operation and management of the air services under their control. While management must vest in the corporations and companies, the Minister must have a general control overbroad aviation policy.   Thus all companies must conform to the policy laid
down by International Convention or by bilateral 6r multilateral agreementsentered into with other States by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Further, itis part of the plan that the Corporations shall operate, either directly or through their approved subsidiaries, all the air routes and services whichare assigned to them. As stated above, an agreed schedule of routes soassigned will be settled covering each of the areas concerned. These routesthe Corporations will undertake to operate. They will not have the powerto cease operation on any scheduled route without the consent of the Minister;but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld if events should prove that one or other of the agreed routes is neither commercially practicable norrequired for the public interest.31. Subsidies. The general policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that both internal and external air services should operate as far as possible without subsidy.32. Internal Services. So far as internal services in the United kingdom are concerned the participants in the Corporation to which these routes willbe assigned and who are investing their own money therein are willingto run without subsidy the agreed schedule of routes which will include,as well as the remunerative services, those routes which the government regard as desirable in the public interest although some of them, if they were dealt with in isolation, could not be run at a profit.33. International Services__In the  international field  the  Governmenthave already declared that it is a cardinal aim of their policy to reducewasteful competitive practices and, in particular, to control subsidies withthe &quot;object of ultimately eliminating them altogether. To this end, they proposed in the White Paper on International Air Transport (Cmd. 6561)and later expounded at Chicago, their considered plan for avoiding un-qconomic competition in international air services, by maintaining a broadequilibrium between transport capacity and traffic offering, a fair divisionof services between the national air lines engaged on international routes,and an agreement as to freight and passenger charges. His Majesfy&apos;s Govern-ment had hoped to secure this by multilateral convention. This did not prove to be possible, but the broad principles laid down in the White paper on International Air Transport remain the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. In any reciprocal arrangements which they make with foreign countries,the Government will stipulate for the. reasonable application of these principles. In this way it is hoped that wasteful competition and subsidiesmay be largely eliminated upon the international routes in which GreatBritain is interested. It is the intention that the agreed schedule of services on the European routes and the Latin American service should be operatedwithout subsidy; provided always that services which the Government regard as essential to maintain are not faced with highly subsidised competition.34. Commonwealth Services. In the past the operation of certain of theCommonwealth routes has required a subsidy. These routes are so essential in the interests of Commonwealth communications that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will be prepared to afford the necessary [financial help to enableB.O.A.C. to operate them.35. New Services. The Government may from time to time wish to have operated a particular route either within the Commonwealth or outside it,which is not in the agreed schedules of services. The Government will havethe power to require the appropriate Corporation to undertake services onsuch a route; but if the Corporation satisfies the Government that such a-
service could not be undertaken without loss, the Government must beprepared to give the Corporation such temporary financial assistance as maybe reasonable.36. Co-operation with Commonwealth and Foreign Air Transport Operators.^-The Commonwealth routes will be operated in full co-operation with thecountries of the British Commonwealth. These routes have already been&amp;gs$- discussed with&apos; the Commonwealth Governments and with the ColonialOffice as representing the Colonial Empire. The Commonwealth Govern-ments have expressed their desire that reciprocal services from their countries to the United Kingdom shall be operated in parallel with the United Kingdomservices, to their countries., In order to make this, parallel system effective and economical, arrangements are being made as regards the type of aircraft to be used and the facilities at the terminals and along the routes. provision will also be made for an equitable division of revenue and expenditure.Arrangements for parallel operation will not, of course, exclude they should,on the contrary facilitate the ultimate conversion of parallel operation intojoint operation whenever and wherever the Governments concerned agreethat this has become desirable.37. His Majesty&apos;s Government will welcome the closest co-operation betweenforeign air line operators running services to the United Kingdom and theAir Transport Corporations set up under the Government plan. Here, too,while parallel operation will probably prevail in the initial phase, the possi-bility of running joint services through subsidiary companies in which theforeign operator would participate, is one which in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may present great advantages.38. It is hoped that the combined training establishment for air crewsand ground staff which will be set up in the United Kingdom, and possibly the joint organisation for the overhaul of aircraft may prove of use to Common-wealth and foreign operators who desire to avail themselves of the facilities offered by these organisations.39. Provision of Aircraft. It is, of course, the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, as it is the desire of the Corporations, that the Corporationsshall use British, aircraft as soon as they can be made available. .The Ministryof Aircraft Production in, collaboration with the Brabazon Committee, hasalready, in anticipation of civil requirements, placed orders for a numberof types. In war, when resources are strained and Service demands areparamount the Government must place the orders for aircraft for civilaviation, because they must control and allocate the priority and distributionof all calls upon the resources of the aircraft industry. But there must bethe closest collaboration between the Department responsible for placing theorders, the user and the producer, so as to ensure that the user gets the type of aircraft that suits the services he is to operate, and that the producercan apply to the needs of the user, the best and latest experience in technical development and in the ingenuity and initiative of design staffs. Air lineoperators, no less than Air Forces, must have their eyes always on the future and not on the past, save in so far as the experience of the past may point the way to future progress. Arrangements have already been made to bringthe new Air Transport Corporations into close collaboration of this kindwith the manufacturers of aircraft and the Government Departments concerned.40. It is the intention of the Government that in the initial stages where such a course is convenient, the Government shall lease the aircraft whichthey have ordered to the Air Transport Corporations. The Governmentwill also be prepared, in appropriate cases, to consider leasing to Common-wealth and foreign operators.
41. In framing their air transport policy, the Government have sought to apply to the development and expansion of our own air services, those principles of ordered progress which they have advocated in the internationalsphere. They are planning to operate as rapidly as the exigencies of warpermit, a complete network -of Commonwealth services in full co-operationwith the Commonwealth Governments. They are bringing into partnershipon practical business lines, those elements which, by reason of their experience and organisation, can contribute to the full and rapid development of - british air transport. In this way the Government believe that they can best &quot; meetthe needs of the peoples of the world for safe, regular, efficient, and economicalair transport &quot;, and enable British civil aviation, which has had to be sub-ordinated to the supreme war effort, to take its rightful place on the airwaysof the world.U&quot;0773)   wt.    -7, loo   a/43   D.L.

APPENDIX II.Copy of a Letter, dated the 8th February, 1945, from the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to the Minister for Civil Aviation.* * *I have been thinking over the Central Company which is discussed in para-graphs 10 and 11 of your recent paper on tbe organisation of civil aviation W.P. (45) 38 and, while I did not raise any objection in principle when thismatter was under discussion in Cabinet, I feel bound to tell you that I have notbeen able to convince myself that the formation of this Company is really essential.In the first place, most of the functions which you propose to assign to itseem to me to be the sort of thing for which adequate administrative provisionexists already. For example, the training of air crews must surely be the respon-sibility of B.O.A.C. and the other operating companies. There is, so far as i know, no complaint about the adequacy of the training which the Corporationalready provide and I cannot see what further improvement the Central Companycould effect. Similarly, responsibility for the welfare of pilots and air crewsis surely a matter for the Corporation and the other operators in the ordinary course of their business, subject, of course, to the Governments being satisfiedthat the arrangements which the Companies make in this respect are satisfactory.Research work in connection with civil aviation is pre-eminently a matter forGovernmental control; all the Service and Supply Departments will need to embark on considerable programmes of research and development after the warand the State will have to be prepared indeed, it is already being asked toprovide very considerable assistance in this field. I have always understoodthat it is impossible and undesirable to draw a rigid dividing line between civil and military aviation research and I should have thought that there was every-thing to be said in favour of leaving the former in the hands of a Minister, who could see that it was properly integrated with research in the military field and research by private firms and that the maximum of efficiency and economy wasthereby realised. I do not&apos;see what a semi-commercial company could contri-bute in this field. Nor can I believe that such a company is really necessary on the ground that somebody must own and operate the central airports to beused by international air services especially if, as I hope, arrangements willbe made, where necessary, for the sharing of airfields after the war betweenthe R.A.F. and the civil operating agencies. In these circumstances, it willsurely be essential that the airports in question should be owned by and should remain under the control of a Government Department.There remains the argument that the formation of a Central Company ofthis kind is an essential part of any policy for the leasing or chartering ofBritish aircraft. I do not think that I differ from you on the objective whichwe should pursue. I can appreciate that in the interim period immediately afterthe war, while no proper civil types of British manufacture are available, theremay well be no alternative to the leasing of converted types on favourable terms as the only means of securing some part of the market for this country; and Ido not think that when it comes down to individual proposals of this kind youwill find us unreasonable. But, accepting the principle, I remain unconvincedthat any special machinery need be created to put it into effect particularlywhen one remembers that legislation would almost certainly be needed to estab-lish such a Company. It would probably be difficult and contentious legislation but the Company would, I imagine, not be needed for more than four or fiveyears. Is there really any necessity to devise so complicated a solution for a problem which cannot be of very long duration and could surely be left to themachinery which is now gradually coming into existence to deal with the disposalof surplus stocks generally ? There seems to me to be nothing in the marketing of surplus aircraft that an ordinary Departmental Contracts Branch should notbe able to handle in its stride. And I am the more convinced of this when Ireflect on our position vis-a-vis the Americans as regards the disposal of aircraft.The Americans have the whip hand so far as both numbers and quality areconcerned, and Lyttelton is, as you know, giving special consideration at themoment to the best means of preventing them from flooding the world with theirsurpluses to the complete exclusion of British types. I understand that thenegotiations in Washington which aim at securing American agreement to apolicy of quantitative control are moving rather slowly and that their outcomeis not certain.   But it would, of course, be an essential corollary of any such
policy that there should be agreement upon price control as well; it is not likely that the Americans would agree to forgo the use of their numerical superiorityif we on our side, having secured a quantitative restriction of supplies, promptlyproceeded to undercut the Americans on price. But undercutting of this kind would, of course, be one of the main objectives of any Company operating ona &apos;&apos; commercial&apos;&apos; basis, and there would inevitably be a constant&apos; struggle between his Majesty&apos;s Government and the Company on the question of the price to becharged for the aircraft. In other words, our relationship with the Americans is such that the price at which we dispose of our surplus aircraft is, whether we like itor not, a political question, and is not one which could safely be left to a purelycommercial entity to determine. If that is so, I cannot see any reason for compli-cating the administrative machine by the creation of a new agency which would,in any case, have to receive its instructions from the Departments which areresponsible for the formulation of policy.I am afraid, therefore, that on reflection I cannot persuade myself that let CclSGfor this Company can be made out. What I can appreciate is that the averagepurchaser of aircraft, particularly if he is a foreigner and unfamiliar with theworking of the Governmental machine in this country, will prefer to buy hisaircraft from a &quot; commercial &quot; entity rather than from His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, both because he will wish to be in direct contact with somebody who cansatisfy him on the technical aspects of his purchase, and because he will like toknow that, if anything goes wrong, the vendor is somebody who can be sued inthe Courts. But is there any objection to B.O.A.C&apos;s. being our agent for thedisposal of aircraft, or alternatively, to our using the manufacturers as our repre-sentatives in this matter ? I know that both the Corporation and the aircraftconstructors are anxious to be in direct contact with other operators and to give them the benefit of their advice on maintenance, overhaul, training, &amp;c.; and Ishould have thought that the Corporation and the constructors between them could provide us with better service in this field than anything for which wecould look from a brand new Company, which would need to be staffed withexpert technicians, would have no existing reputation or long-standing goodwillby which to enlist the confidence of its clients, and wOuld, incidentally, place yeta further strain on the capital market. I know that you share my dislike ofmultiplying administrative entities unnecessarily, and I should be very gratefulif you would look once more at the conception of the Central Company and would see whether the agencies which already exist for the functions which you set outare not sufficient.* * *(Signed) JOHN ANDERSON.Copy op a Letter dated 15th February, 1945, from the Minister of CivilAviation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.-Xs ^t- Ht*I have given very careful consideration to your letter of the 8th Februarydealing with my proposal for the establishment of a central company.There is no difference between us as to the objectives which I sought to coverin paragraphs 10 and 11 of my Paper W.P. (45) 38, and for all or some of whichI proposed the creation of a central company. But you advance very cogentreasons why these objectives can be fully and more conveniently met by other means. You further establish the fact that a new company would require legislation, and that therefore, apart from other considerations, we should delaya number of matters with which we want to get ahead as rapidly as possible.L admit that I find great force in your arguments, some of which arereinforced by my own further experience in working out a detailed applicationof the general plan which the Cabinet has approved.Let me take seriatim the points you raise :1. Training of Air Crews and Ground Staff.All the operators agree that it will be sound and economical to run a jointtraining establishment, where the best training can be given at the highest commonstandard. For this combined organisation it will be necessary to draw on the staffs of the individual operating companies; and the training organisation mustrun throughout in the closest touch with the operating companies. Moreover, Iam most anxious that the companies and the training establishment should havean intimate contact from the start with the Air Member for Personnel, so that!
men of the R.A.F. may have every possible opportunity of securing employmentin civil aviation. I agree, therefore, that training can best be done by thecompanies working together on these lines.2. Welfare.This must primarily be the responsibility of the operating companies, theGovernment being satisfied that the conditions are such as a &quot; model employershould provide, and that.the conditions should meet the special requirements ofair line personnel, e.g., the pilot who becomes too old for flying and for whom a suitable ground job cannot be found. I thought at first that the Central Com-pany might establish a provident fund to which the operating companies andthe men would contribute; but on further consideration I agree with you that thisshould be the responsibility of the companies. Indeed, if a Government-ownedCentral Company assumed any part of the financial liability, I can see that itmight create a bad precedent.3. Research.The Department of Civil Aviation will have to be in daily touch with M.A.P.,operators and manufacturers, and with the application to civil aviation of radio and other devices. In all this it must have a great say in research; not in doingresearch itself but in ensuring that the right kind of research for civil aviationis undertaken. In these circumstances I am quite ready to accept directministerial responsibility.4. Airports.The Government must continue as in the past to own the main internationalairports; and the Department of Civil Aviation, directly or indirectly, must beresponsible for operational control. On other airfields it must provide specialisedequipment for the use of civil aviation, irrespective of ownership; and it mustbe responsible for operational control of these airfields also. I agree there ismuch to be said for making the Minister directly responsible for- these activities.I am, as you know, a strong advocate of the common user of airfields; and I appreciate what you say as to co-operation with the R.A.F. being more satisfactoryif Ministers and Departments can deal direct with one another. Moreover, what-ever policy we ultimately adopt with regard to municipal and privately-ownedairfields, it is more constitutional and more convenient that negotiations andarrangements with regard to this should be in the hands of the Minister.5. Sale and Leasing of Aircraft.I appreciate greatly the helpful attitude you have taken with regard to theleasing of aircraft during the difficult and critical interim period. Here I agreethat each case must be considered on its merits. Political as well as economicaland financial considerations will affect the decisions; and each case will requireconsultation between the Treasury and my Department, and probably M.A.P.as well. The Minister of Production may also be concerned in the earlier stages.These political and financial decisions must be taken by Ministers or by Depart-ments; and the company would have to implement the policy laid down in eachcase by Ministers.I appreciate also the difficulty of legislation. The object of our policy,laudable as it is, does not lend itself easily to Parliamentary exposition, whichwould not be liable to criticism outside this country. Moreover, we shall want to act before legislation can be effective. I feel bound, therefore, to accept yourcriticism and your alternative.We shall have to meet the case of the foreigner who is unwilling to contract with a Government he cannot sue; but your suggestion that we should useB.O.A.C. meets that point. Indeed, there is a good deal to be said in favour ofentrusting this business to B.O.A.C., who have the expert knowledge and themeans of giving technical assistance. And the fact that B.O.A.C. would be ouragents for conferring these benefits will secure them a good-will in countriesthrough which they will be operating.6. You have, therefore, convinced me that we can do all the things I suggested should be done through the agency of a company in a more direct and better way, and for my part, I am quite willing to accept your proposals. as this involves a change of method, although not, I think, any change of purposeor result, I think I should report our conclusions to the War Cabinet.*. * *SWINTON.
