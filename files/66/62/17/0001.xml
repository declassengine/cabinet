THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECEET. Copy no..W.P. (45) 112.23rd February, 1945.WAR CABINET.DAYLIGHT  SAVING.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AN announcement must be made in the near future concerning theGovernments policy in regard to daylight saving during 1945.2. In the pre-war period, Summer time was fixed by Acts of Parliamentto run normally from the Sunday next following the third Saturday in April tothe Sunday next following the first Saturday in October. Under the Defence(Summer Time) Regulations, 1939, Summer time has, during the war, been continued throughout the year. Double Summer time was first introduced in1941 and the periods of its duration each year have been as follows : 1941 ......       ... 4th May to 10th August.1942 ......      ... 5th April to 8th August.1943 ......... 4th April to 15th August.1944 .......... 2nd April to 17th September.3. The views of. the various -Departments in regard to the policy to befollowed during 1945 are set out in a memorandum by the Home Secretary(L.P. (45) 44) which was considered by the Lord Presidents Committee at their meeting on the 23rd February, 1945 (L.P. (45) 10th Meeting, Minute 2). Briefly,the Agricultural Ministries consider that, in this sixth year of the war, thearguments from the point of view of the agricultural community and foodproduction in favour of reverting to the pre-war practice or, at any rate, of limiting Double Summer time to the shortest possible period, are stronger than ever before. On the other hand, the transport position is so grave that theMinister of War Transport feels that Double Summer time, at any rate duringthe early months of the Summer, will be essential to the maintenance of our war effort. This view is supported by the Minister of Labour and National Serviceand the Minister of Supply from the point of view of war production. the savings in fuel which result from daylight saving are also an important consideration.4. The Lord Presidents Committee are satisfied that operational needsmust have priority during the early part of the Summer and that Double Summertime should, therefore, be introduced on about the same date as in 1944. On theother hand, they consider that serious account should be taken of the requirementsof food production and of the interests of the agricultural community in deciding the date on which Double Summer time should terminate. They accordingly recommend that, in 1945, Double Summer time should run from the 1st April tothe 15th July.5. If the recommendation in the preceding paragraph is approved, the lord presidents Committee suggest that the Government, in announcing their decision,should indicate that the position will be reviewed in the Summer, in the light ofthe war situation at that time. It should, however, be stated that theGovernment hope that the situation may then be such that it will not be necessaryto extend the period of Double Summer time beyond the 15th July and that itmay be possible, in accordance with pre-war practice, to revert to GreenwichMean Time on the 7th October.6.   Since the meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee, the Home secretary has drawn my attention to the fact that the selection of the 1st April, which is[29289]
ANNEX.Copy of a Home Office Letter of the 23rd February, 1945.THE Home Secretary has asked me to call your attention to a point connectedwith the subject of Double Summer Time which was not in his mind when thematter was discussed at the Lord President&apos;s Committee this morning. TheCommittee, I understand, decided to recommend that Double Summer time should begin on the 1st April. The 1st April is Easter Sunday, and there hasin the past been some objection on the part of the Ecclesiastical Authorities toadvancing the clock on the night preceding Easter Sunday. The peace-timeAct of 1922 provides that normally Summer Time shall begin in the morningfollowing the third Saturday in April or, if that day is Easter Sunday, the morning following the second Saturday in April. This provision was insertedbecause on Easter Sunday it is the practice to hold very early services in the churches; and it is some hardship if people are deprived of an hour&apos;s sleep inthe preceding night.2. In 1942 this point was overlooked and the Defence Regulation fixingDouble Summer Time provided that it should start on Easter Sunday. the archbishop of Canterbury wrote to. the Home Secretary pointing out &quot; thatone effect of this order would be that many members of the Church of Englandwho are expected to make their communions on Easter morning and who areemployed in one way or another till very late and need all the sleep they can get, would by virtue of this order be deprived of an hour&apos;s sleep, which isregarded as a real hardship. The letters have been so numerous that I oughtto be in a position to say that I have approached and consulted you on the matter.&quot;No change was, however, made in the order, and the Home Secretary wrote to the archbishop saying that, while he recognised the hardship to early communicants,there were weighty and numerous factors which the Government had to take into account in fixing the date.3. The Home Secretary does not feel that this difficulty with regard to persons attending early services on Easter Sunday is a conclusive argument, or that it should necessarily outweigh the considerations which the Committee hadin mind in deciding that the 1st April would be the most appropriate date thisyear : but he thinks the point ought to be mentioned when the matter comes beforethe Cabinet.Easter Sunday, as the date on which Double Summer time should be introduced,is likely to give rise to objection on the part of the Ecclesiastical Authorities. Acopy of a letter from the Home Office dealing with this point is annexed to thismemorandum.(Intd.)   G. E. A.Privy Council Office,23rd February, 1945.
