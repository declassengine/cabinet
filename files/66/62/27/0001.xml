Am     &apos;   h J\     3 . Vi&quot;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GQYfiRNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. Copy No. &apos;W.P. (45) 122.1st March, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE POLISH SITUATION.Memorandum by the Chancellor oe the Exchequer.IF and when His Majesty&apos;s Government decide to cease to recognise thepresent Polish Government in London and to give recognition to a new Govern-ment, it is important that the new Government should accept liability for debts dueto His Majesty&apos;s Government or to firms in this country by the present PolishGovernment in London or by its predecessors.We have advanced the following sums to the Polish Government in London (1)  98 million, approximately, as a military credit, and(2)  23 million, approximately, as a civil credit.A large part of the military credit will probably be covered by the retroactiveapplication of Mutual Aid but no figure is at present available.Debts due to other Government departments amount to about  3^ million.Sums due from Poland to individual British subjects in the form of tradedebts, bank balances, interest and dividends, &amp;c, amount to at least  7 million,and probably a good deal more, whereas trade debts due by persons in thiscountry to Poland do not amount to more than about  1 million. We shall needan assurance that in due course these debts will be transferred in sterling.If we continue to make advances for the pay of Polish forces (in additionto affording equipment, &amp;c, as Mutual Aid), it will have to be considered whetherthe Polish Government will remain liable for the eventual repayment of suchadvances.It may be noted that the Bank Polski, the Central bank of Poland, holds 20 million of gold in territory under our control; but it is not clear whether we could make use of this asset to meet the Polish Governments liabilities. Thelegal position is being carefully examined.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,1st March, 1945.[29326]
