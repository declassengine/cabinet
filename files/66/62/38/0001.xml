THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY. OF HIS BRITANNljfcl MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ;iPrinted for the War Cabinet.  M%rch 1945.SECRET.- \\ Copy No.W.P. (45) 133.3rd March, 1945.WAR CABINET.THIRD SESSION OF THE COUNCIL OF U.N.R.R.A.Memorandum by the Minister of State.THE Director-General of United Nations Relief and rehabilitation administration has asked member Governments for their views as to the date and scope of the next session of the Council of the Administration. He has also asked informally whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would agree to the proposedsession being held in London.2. The U.N.R.R.A. agreement provides that the Council must be convenednot less than twice a year. The last session was at Montreal in September last.The next session is due,, therefore, not later than in May of this year.3. From some points of view a session of the Council appears at this timeto be a luxury which might well be dispensed with. What is urgently required of U.N.R.R.A. is action rather than speeches. This consideration is anywaydecisive against a long meeting, large delegations or an elaborate and detailedagenda.4. On the other hand a session of the Council can, if properly directed,serve to give to U.N.R.R.A. a reality which it still lacks, to show that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are genuinely interested in making it a success, to spuron the staff of the Administration, and to convert the pent-up &quot;dissatisfactionof Allied Governments into constructive criticism. The period of U.N.R.R.A.&apos;main responsibilities is now about to begin; for instance, it is expected that.N.R.R.A. will take charge of relief in Greece and Yugoslavia at the beginningof April. For the Administration at such a time to be called upon to give an account of its stewardship in terms of positive action should have a most salutary effect.5. For these reasons I consider that a session of the Council in the Springor early Summer is desirable as well as constitutionally necessary, provided thatit is compact and expeditious and confines itself to questions of major practical importance.6. As regards the place, it is clear that this will have to be either inEngland or, once again, on the American Continent. We had hoped that by april or May it would be possible to hold the meeting on the Continent of Europe.The French Provisional Government have, however, said that accommodation and transport conditions would not make a meeting possible at this time in Paris,and I am afraid that similar considerations will rule out a meeting elsewhere onthe Continent. It is important on general grounds that the next session of theCouncil should be held in the vicinity of Europe rather than in the more rarefiedatmosphere of the Americas; and it is important that we should be in the strongest possible position to influence its proceedings. A session in Englandwould thus be to our advantage. The difficulties of accommodation in thiscountry are serious. I am. advised, however, that they are not insuperable; andif they restrict the scope and length of the proceedings, that will suit our intentions very well.7.   I therefore seek authority (a) to advocate that a session of the Council be convened for May 1945.(b) to advocate that it be brief and confined to practical problems.(c) subject to (&amp;) above, to accept the suggestion which has already been putforward by U.N.R.R.A. that the meeting should take place in thiscountry.r,       - &apos; R.
