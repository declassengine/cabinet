THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYEBNMBNTGRATUITIES FOR CIVIL DEFENCE WORKERS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.AS I feel some responsibility for the Civil Defence Services, having been one of the two Ministers responsible for the raising and formation of the force,may I ask for a reconsideration of the decision of Tuesday the 13th instant thata war gratuity be granted but at lower rates than those for the Armed Forces.I am glad to see that the view in favour of a Civil Defence war-time gratuityhas prevailed, but I feel that the Government stand the risk of spoiling theeffect on the service by putting the rates lower than those for the Armed Forces.2. As these gratuities are to be given to make resettlement in civil lifeeasier it may be said that the Civil Defence Workers have been in close touchwith their local conditions and those in the Armed Forces have not. In manycases this is true,, but it is also true that, on the whole, Civil Defence workers are generally older than&apos; those in the Armed Forces, as all who have seen themparade together will realise; and it should be borne in mind that, with the limitedexception of those conscripted under the Act of 1942, they have no reinstatementrights in respect of their previous jobs.3. The majority volunteered when the force was first recruited, they havedone a necessary and, in the case of the bombed areas, a vital warlservice. Inthe case of the areas which have been heavily attacked they have carried outtasks demanding great courage, skill and devotion to duty. Since it has beendecided to pay them war gratuities I would urge that the payment should beat similar rates to those in other Services.Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1945:SECRET.Copy No.W.P.
