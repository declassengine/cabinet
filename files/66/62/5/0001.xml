THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYEBNMEHTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 100.IQth February, 1945.WAR CABINET.EVACUATION OE SICK CIVILIANS FROM THE CHANNEL ISLANDS.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and&apos; Minister of home security and the Minister of State.THE German Government have proposed that 1,000 seriously ill civiliansshould be evacuated from the Channel Islands to the United Kingdom, and thatthe operation should be effected by a neutral vessel (a Swedish hospital ship with100 &quot;beds), on the understanding that the local German authorities shoulddesignate those to be evacuated. The German Government have also agreedthat a doctor-delegate of the International Red Cross Committee should go assoon as possible to the Islands to make preparations for the evacuation. TheGermans have also expressed a desire that 200 wounded German soldiers whom it is impossible to care for on the spot should be evacuated at the same time as the civilians; but the Germans do not appear to make the evacuation of the civilians dependent on the evacuation of the wounded German soldiers.2. As regards civilians, we are advised by the medical advisers of theMinistry of Health that there is no reason to think that, in the conditionsobtaining in the Islands, the figure of 1,000 seriously ill civilians is exaggerated.We think that there can be no doubt that the German offer to evacuate seriouslyill civilians must, in principle, be accepted. The machinery for evacuationhas been considered at a conference of representatives of the Departmentsconcerned; and, if the War Cabinet agree that arrangements for evacuatingseriously ill civilians should be made, we propose that they should be on thefollowing lines: (i) The selection of the civilians to be evacuated should be made by a neutral medical commission, consisting of at least two doctorsappointed by the International Red Cross Committee, who would nodoubt consult the local civil authorities and medical practitioners.The persons selected should be those who are so seriously ill that itis imperative to remove them from the Islands. It should be an instruction to the Commission that they should ensure as far aspossible that no civilian is evacuated against his will,(ii) It does not appear that there is any Swedish or other neutral hospital ship suitable for the purpose, having regard to the tidal conditionsof the Channel Island harbours. The only suitable ship for thispurpose appears to be one of those specially built for the channel islands traffic which are now used as hospital ships. It is proposedthat, subject to the approval of S.H.A.E.F. as to the release of a ship, we should offer to the German Government to use one of these ships for the purpose of bringing the sick direct from the Islands tothe United Kingdom, and that it should be manned by a Britishcrew; or, if the Germans are unwilling to agree to this, that a Swedishcrew should be brought here from Sweden for the purpose.Copy Ndi[29239]
3.   As regards the wounded German soldiers, it is not clear whether theGermans propose that they should be repatriated, or interned in the UnitedKingdom or in a neutral country; and the International Red Cross Committeehave asked the Germans for further details of this proposal.   We understandthat the Directorate of Prisoners-of-War see no objection to the transfer to this        Scountry&apos; from the Channel Islands of wounded German soldiers who come within       /the category of repatriable prisoners-of-war under the International convention of 1929.   This proposal will require further consideration when it is known -more clearly what the Germans have in mind.  .4. We should be glad to have the authority Of the&quot; War Cabinet to proceedwith arrangements for evacuating from the Channel Islands the civilians so seriously ill that removal is imperative for reasons of health.II. M.- :     - - R. K. L.Whitehall, S.W. 1, IQth February, 1945.
