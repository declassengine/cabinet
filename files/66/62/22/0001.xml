It is issued for the persona! use of........../^^r*fv*-^-^vfW.P. (45) 117.2Qth February, 1945.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER.Directive by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.I. It is evident that we are attempting more than our resources will permit,and some restatement of the priorities which underlie our planning is called forin order to effect the necessary easement. Our war effort cannot be maintainedunless our civil economy receives a considerable reinforcement. In particular weshould aim at a total increase of about 275,000 in the first half of 1945 in thelabour force allocated to the Board of Trade.II.&quot;  The following principles should guide the allocation of man-power : (a) First priority must of course continue to be given to what is required to achieve the defeat of Germany at the earliest possible date. above all, the first-line strength of the Army in Europe must be maintained,and such essential needs as artillery ammunition must be met. Someearlier diminution in our air strength in Europe in the latter half of1945 can, however, be accepted. Man-power should not in any case beemployed on the manufacture of aircraft or other munitions of war. designed for use only in the European theatre, which cannot becompleted until after the end of 1945.(b) Subject to (a), every effort must be made to meet the essential requirements for a reasonable expansion of civil production.(c) I do not propose that there should be any change in the ultimate overallstrength of the Forces to be deployed against Japan, but there can be some delay in their build-up and equipment, including reserves.Munitions programmes should be reviewed in the light of this general principle.TOP SECRET &apos; . \1 &apos; &apos;  Copy No. 3 6
10;Downing Street, S.W. 1,262A February, 1945.(d) We should ensure that man-power is not employed in the manufacture in quantity of equipment of new and improved types, where equipmentqf older but serviceable types is available for the purposes of theJapanese war. Scales of initial equipment, assumed wastage rates,and scales of reserves should also be scrutinised. Items of equipment which are not absolutely essential should be eliminated. Over-insurance in provision is a luxury we cannot afford.(e) This directive does not mean that where no equipment is available for a specific purpose the new equipment to be manufactured should notbe of good quality. Nor is this directive intended to debar themanufacture of limited quantities of equipment of improved type,even where some stocks of older and serviceable types are available.But this should be confined to items of special importance.III. The Ministerial Committee on Man-power are invited to re-examinethe man-power position in the light of this directive, consulting the Chiefs ofStaff and the Joint War Production Staff as necessary.W. S. C.
