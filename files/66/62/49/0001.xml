DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC^MAJEST^S ^GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March J.945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 144.6th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.LABOUR FOR THE COTTON-SPINNING INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.WE are facing a grave crisis in the supply of cotton textiles. Productionamong the United Nations is falling, while essential demands are rising, especially for the Far Eastern war, for liberated peoples in Europe and the Far East, andfor some alleviation to our own civilians and those of other countries, like India;who have suffered the worst deprivation through the use of textiles and textilecapacity for war purposes.2. When the Materials Committee allocated cotton yarn for the first quarterof 1945, expected United Kingdom production was only 82,000 tons againstdepartmental claims of about 112,000 tons. In the second quarter the deficiencyis likely to be worse. There is a particularly severe shortage in the coarser counts,for the making of canvas, conveyor belting and other essential products. I amseeking the maximum relief from the United States towards the deficiencyamong the rest of the United Nations, but their own production is falling againstrising demands, and, in any event, our case for further assistance must rest onproof that we are doing everything possible to help ourselves.3. Our shortage is primarily in labour, not in materials or capacity orancillary requirements. The total labour force in October last was 92,706 inspinning and doubling and 96,880 in weaving. Wastage is very high, amountingto 22,873 gross and 8,457 net in both sections in the year ended October 1944. I discussed this matter with the Minister of Labour and National Service, thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Supply, and we agreed toset a target output of 8,500 tons of yarn per normal working week (against a1944 average of about 6,800 tons) with the equivalent balanced labour force in all sections. This was the level aimed at in the concentration of the cotton industry,but never since attained.4. The first step is clearly to get back into the cotton industry as manyformer cotton operatives as possible. As far as &apos;&apos; higher grade &apos;&apos; women are con-cerned and they are the key problem these are all registered and identified.Over 80 per cent, of these are not directable, and of the directables many cannot inpractice be directed back to cotton. If the Ministry of Labour are given a freehand to extract ex-cotton operatives from munitions and other work, they estimatethey will effectively restore about 2,450 women to the spinning and doublingsections. This measure, taken with the reopening of a few closed mills, mayinduce perhaps 1,000 non-directable women in those sections to return to cotton.5. This additional labour force will add about 600 tons of yarn per week to existing production about one-third of the way to the target that we have set.But even that is dependent on continuous making good of wastage. Up to that point, little or no increased labour will be required in the weaving section, sincespinning and doubling are now out of balance with weaving and there are important unfilled uses for yarn other than weaving.6.   The extraction of 2,450 directable women ex-cotton operatives will have some marginal effect on munitions production.  The Supply Ministers agree with me that this will be tolerable, with the possible exception of the Oldham area,which is unfortunately/tlie centre of coarse spinning this being the crux of the[29375]Copy No.
supply problem. The issue narrows in effect to four firms in that district, ofparticular concern to the Ministry of Aircraft Production and (one of them) tothe Admiralty.  The following figures display the issue in summary form : i i Firm.    j              Product. * 1		Number of Employees.		Ex-Cotton Women (spinning and doubling).	Likely to be obtained by Direction.

I recommend that the extraction of these ex-cotton operatives without prior substitution be approved, notwithstanding the possibility of marginal injury to munitions production. The Ministry of Labour will, of course, have the respon-sibility of filling the consequent vacancies at the earliest possible moment underfirst-preference procedure, since the products of the firms are designated. TheMinister of Labour believes, however, that the&apos; condition of substitution inadvance of transfer would unduly delay and even prevent the necessary action,nOt only because the double movement of labour cannot be easily synchronised,but also because such a condition enables the firms concerned to raise difficulties about the skill of the operatives which will in practice be overcome.8. I also recommend that similar steps be approved as regards former cottonspinners and doublers in non-munitions production and other occupations. Ifwe ate ready to suffer any risk to vital munitions production that may be involvedwe must in principle apply the decision also to other employments.9. The above measures are in my view necessary in order to arrest thedecline in cotton production and restore it for the time being to a less dangerousthough still quite inadequate level. They will bring us only one-third of the wayto the target level of production in spinning and doubling, even if wastage is made good from now on. As soon as we get beyond this initial step additional labour will have to be found in the weaving sections as well.TO. Further substantial improvement in the spinning and doubling sections,however, manifestly depends oh the training and induction of inexperiencedlabour. If this is to be arranged quickly, some radical changes in the organisa-tion, working conditions and wage structure of the industry will be required.Such.changes are vital, hot only to the long-term strength of the industry and itsability to help solve our export problem, but to the conduct of the war.11.   To help to improve the position, two steps have so far been taken :-(a) It has been agreed with the industry that two experimental mills (and perhaps more later) should be conducted under the auspices of theCotton Board to test improved machinery and methods, includingmethods of organisation and payment of labour.(&apos;&amp;.) At the instance of the Minister of Labour, a committee representativeof employers and unions in the industry has been formed to reportperiodically on the progress made in improving conditions of employ-ment and prospects for workers in the industry and arrangements forthe recruitment and training of labour.O.
