THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT---- - &quot; ----------  :  :        &apos;    &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;   T&quot; &quot;-&quot;&quot;* &quot; printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1945. secret.W.P. (45) 110.23rd February, 1945.WAR CABINET.AIRFIELDS.Note by the Prime Minister.1. I am disturbed at the extent of the demands which are coming forward for post-war airfields and at the unco-ordinated way in which they are being-presented.   Thus,. (a) The Secretary of State for Air has suggested that of 430 R.A.F. airfieldswith hard runways, 250 will be required for the peace-time R.A.F.and all the remaining 180 should be kept as a strategic reserve, ona care and maintenance basis preserving the hard runways (R. (45) 19).(b) The Minister of Civil Aviation has forecast a substantial requirement for civil aviation but he is discussing how far his needs can be dove-tailed in with military requirements (R. (45) 25).(c) The Minister of Aircraft Production has reported that to build the twoBrabazon prototypes authorised by the War Cabinet, it will benecessary to extend the Bristol Company&apos;s airfield at Filton; and similar problems will probably arise later in connection with theconstruction of large-scale aircraft by other Companies (L.P. (45) 25and L.P. (45) 6th Meeting, Minute 1).2. These proposals require very careful examination if we are to avoidwasteful expenditure and the unnecessary sacrifice of land, buildings and amenities.3. I propose, therefore, that the matter should be dealt with in the following-manner : (i) The Chiefs of Staff should first submit for provisional approval of theWar Cabinet a broad appreciation of the military requirements forairfields, in the light of their estimate of the post-war size and defenceroles of the three Services.29288
(ii) An ad hoc Cabinet Committee should then be appointed (a) to assess the airfield requirements of civil aviation and aircraft production, and to see how far these could be dovetailed in with military needs, to avoid duplication; and- (b) to arrange for a detailed examination, under their general guidance, of the means by which the overall needs (assessed by(i) and (ii) (a) above) could be met at the least cost in terms ofboth money and damage to other assets.This Committee should be composed as follows:  The Lord President (Chairman).The Minister of Reconstruction.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Committee would, of course, take into consultation the Ministerswhose interests are affected by these proposals.(iii) The results of this enquiry under (ii) should be reported to the WarCabinet who should make the final reconciliation between the con-conflicting interests.W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,23rd February, 1945.
