Printed for the War Cabinet, February, 1945TOP SECRETfy copy NoOOW.P.&apos;(45) 10722nd February, 1945The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of(WAR CABINETPROPOSAL TO ACCREDIT ANDREW ROTHSTEIN TO S.HA.E.F.MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR WAR1. The Tass Agency have asked that we shall accredit Andrew Rothstein toS.H.A.E.F. for duty as a war correspondent with 21 Army Group.2. An application was made by the Tass Agency in August, 1943, for the accreditingof Rothstein to the British Forces in the United Kingdom. While the matter was still under consideration, the application was withdrawn.3. The Security Service are not in favour of the accrediting of Rothstein, on theground that he is a foundation member of the Communist Party. The Government have refused to accredit as correspondents representatives of the. &quot; Daily Worker primarily on the grounds of their connexion with the British Communist Party, and I am of theopinion that we shall considerably weaken our ground vis-a-vis the &quot; Daily Worker &quot;,if we agree to this request from the Tass Agency. On 18th January, 1944, I stated inthe House of Commons that the Government were not prepared to accredit members&apos;hi the British Communist Party because &quot; some of its members or adherents haveshown that they are ready to subordinate the security of the State to the purposes ofthe organization . . . Recent experience, drawn in part from the cases of D. F.Springhall and O. L. Uren, has made it clear that members and adherents cannot be trusted not to communicate secret information to the Communist Party &quot;. I accordinglypropose that the present application be refused, and I understand that this proposal hasthe support of the Home Office.4. On the other hand, representatives of the Tass Agency who have not beenmembers of the British Communist Party have been accredited in various parts of theworld, and it is probably quite by accident of nationality or domicile that they are not members, of the British Communist Party. Moreover, Rothstein is a man of longresidence and some standing in this country, and has for the past two years beenPresident of the Foreign Press Association in London. He is favourably regarded bythe Foreign Office, who report that he has written some excellent articles about our war effort and has received special facilities involving security considerations, such as&apos;visits to flying stations during operations and attendance at special manoeuvres.5. For these reasons it is the view of the Foreign Office that Rothstein might wellbe a better choice than some Russian correspondent, about whom nothing would be known. It is, in the Foreign Office view, questionable whether his appointment toS.H.A.E.F. would really prejudice the strength of our position vis-a-vis the &quot; daily worker &quot;. The &quot; Daily Worker &quot; is a British publication and the political outlookof its correspondents is therefore a matter with which we are justified in concerningourselves. If, despite this, the decision about the &quot; Daily Worker &quot; aroused public criticism, it is the opinion of the Foreign Office that the rejection of RothstehVscandidature might give rise to comments in Parliament and the Press which it would beeven more difficult to meet. The Foreign Office would therefore prefer not to refuse the present application.6. Despite these arguments, I am convinced that the accrediting of Rothsteinwould be a serious embarrassment in defending the decision of the Government not toaccredit representatives of the &quot; Daily Worker &quot; : in fact, it might well result in thatdecision having to be reversed. One of the main arguments in favour of accreditingRothstein is the possibly adverse effect upon our relations with Russia which a refusalmight have; but I do not recall that the Soviet Government have been unduly tenderin considering our susceptibilities. On balance, I think the request of the Tass agency should be refused, and I ask the approval of the War Cabinet to that course.The War Office,22nd February, 1945.P.
