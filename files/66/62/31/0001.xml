(45) 126.2nd March, 1945.WAR CABINET.RELAXATION OF LIGHTING AND GLARE RESTRICTIONS IN THELONDON AREA.Report by the, Chiefs of Staff.ranStreet Lighting.AT their meeting on Tuesday, the 9th January, the War Cabinet*- &quot; Agreed that the question whether, and if so to what extent, theinstitution of full lighting by gas-lit street-lamps in London would assistthe enemy aircraft which launched flying-bombs should be remitted forconsideration by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.&quot;We have considered this question and report as follows : 2. Provided the additional lighting is confined to the gas-lit street-lampsin London itself, the total intensity of lighting will be less than it was in peace-time, and in peace-time the glow was not visible save in exceptional conditionsfrom more than 100 miles to an aircraft at about 5/6,000 feet, even on a clearnight.3. The flying-bombs are launched from about 1,500-2,000 feet at about120 miles range, the approach flight being made at 300 feet. At these heights itis most unlikely that the increased lighting proposed would be visible from100 miles.   .4. If the enemy came close enough or flew high enough to see the light hewould be exposed to far greater risk of destruction. This, risk he is unlikely toaccept unless seeing the light would make a great difference to accuracy, and perhaps not even then.5. . The flying-bomb is steered by a mechanism pre-set at base and incapable of adjustment in the air. For accuracy it must be released at the correct spotand must have been set to allow for the speed and direction of the wind. Ifthe pilot oame near enough to see the glow of London he might be enabled to check his position for line but he could not check it for range.&quot;6. The enemy is believed to be experimenting with radio aids to accuratelaunching, and he is much more likely to seek greater accuracy by these meansthan by trying to exploit&apos; the visible effect of increased lighting in London at a greatly increased risk of loss to his aircraft. .7. For the above reasons we consider that, provided the lighting is restricted to gas-lit street lamps in London itself, such relaxation of the black-out wouldnot materially assist the enemy in his air-launched flying-bomb attacks on London.Part II.Glare Restrictions on Coke Ovens.8. At their meeting! on the 26th January, the Lord presidents committee : &apos;&quot; Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security to consult with the Chiefs of Staff with a view*W.M. (45) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 6. f L.P. (45), 5th Meeting[29335]
to their including in their forthcoming appreciation an examination of thepossibility of permitting coke to be drawn by night at the Beckton works and removing anti-glare structures from other coke ovens in the london area.&quot;We have considered this question, in consultation with representatives ofthe Minister of Fuel and Power and of the Home Secretary and Minister of home security and report as follows : 9. The glare produced by the relaxation of restrictions on the BecktonWorks and on other coke, ovens in the London area would, when added to theinstitution of full lighting by gas-lit street lamps, be considerable and would be clearly visible at times up to distances of 80 miles or more. It is unlikely, how-ever, for the reasons given in Part I of this Report, to assist the enemy materiallyas regards the accuracy of his air-launched flying-bomb attacks on London.10. On the other hand successive relaxations of lighting and anti-glarerestrictions would undoubtedly lend some increased provocation to attack by enemy piloted aircraft and offer comparatively easy targets for bombing. Inview, however, of fuel and other limitations with which the enemy is confronted,such attacks could only be light and sporadic and are in our view not very likelyto take place. We consider therefore that selected relaxations, in particular suchas that for the Beckton Works, which offer valuable industrial dividends, arefrom the military point of view acceptable.Part III.Further Relaxations of Black-out.11. We are advised by the Ministry of Home Security that the relaxation of restrictions on gas-lit street lighting would inevitably lead to the removal- offurther street lighting restrictions and that concessions in the case of Becktonwill give rise to demands for relaxations affecting no less than 50 other war production plants in the Greater London area. It appears that the Minister ofHome Security will not feel able to resist these demands once the initial concessionhas been made.12. If this were the case we must point out that a wide-spread relaxation of the black-out in the Greater London area, particularly if it were to spread to the coastal areas in the South and East, might well give rise to serious air and naval objections not attaching to the limited proposals initially presented to us.Recommendation.13. In view of the somewhat complex and conflicting issues involved werecommend that the War Cabinet should set up a suitable inter-departmentalcommittee to which all questions of relaxation of the black-out could be referredas they arise for detailed examination and report. In the meanwhile we recom-mend that decisions regarding the removal of restriction of gas-lit street lightingand at the Beckton Works should be taken in the light of our report dependingupon whether these can be treated as isolated and special cases.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.C. PORTAL.ANDREW CUNNINGHAM.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2nd March, 1945.Note. Since the above report was drafted, we have received evidence of increased activity on the part of German pickaback aircraft. Any considerablerelaxation of black-out in the London area might afford the enemy assistance inlaunching attacks by these aircraft. We therefore suggest that whilst prepara-tions for restoring full lighting by gas-lit street lamps and for removing anti-glare structures from coke ovens in the London area be put in hand, there shouldbe no actual increase in the amount of lighting permitted without further reference to us.(Signed)      .
