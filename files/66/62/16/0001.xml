It is noexaggeration or compliment of a florid, kind when I say that we regard marshal stalin&apos;s life as most precious to the hopes and hearts of all of us. There havebeen many conquerors in history, but few of them have been statesmen, and mostof them threw away the fruits of victory in the troubles which followed theirwars. I earnestly hope that the Marshal may be spared to give to the peopleof the Soviet Union and to help us all to move forward to a less unhappy time.than that through which we have recently come. I walk through this worldwith greater courage and hope when I find myself in a relation of friendship and intimacy with this great man whose fame has gone out not only over allRussia, but the world. Thus supporting my friend the President, I desire tojoin[292471
Marshal Stalin.&apos;&apos; I propose a toast for the leader of the British Empire, the most courageousof all Prime Ministers in the world, embodying political experience with militaryleadership, who when all Europe was ready to fall flat before Hitler said that britain would stand and fight alone against Germany even without any Allies.Even if the existing and possible Allies deserted her, he\said she would continue ,to fight.&quot; To the health of the man who is born once in a hundred years and -who bravely held up the banner of Great Britain. I have said what I feel,Avhat I have at heart and of what I am conscious.&quot;The Prime Minister.    &apos; .:&quot; I must say that never in this war have I felt the responsibility weighso heavily on me, even the darkest hours, as now&apos; during this Conference. but now for the reasons which the Marshal has given, we see that we are on thecrest of the hill and there is before us the prospect of open country. Do notlet us underestimate the difficulties. Nations, comrades in arms, have in thepast drifted apart within five or ten years of war. Thus toiling millions have followed a vicious circle, falling into the pit, and then by their sacrifices raisingthemselves up again. We now have a chance of avoiding the errors of previousgenerations and of making a sure peace. People cry&apos; out for peace and joy.Will the families be reunited 1 Will the warrior come home ? Will the shattereddwellings be rebuilt ? Will the toiler see his home ? To defend one&apos;s countrvis glorious, but there are greater conquests before us. Before us lies the realiza-tion of the dream of the poor that they shall live in peace, protected by ourinvincible power fr6m aggression and evil. My hope is in the illustriousPresident&apos; of the United States and in Marshal Stalin, in whom we shall find the champions of peace, who after smiting the foe will lead us to carry on thetask against poverty, confusion, chaos and oppression. That is my hope and,speaking for England, we shall not be behind-hand in our efforts. We shallnot weaken in supporting your exertions. The Marshal spoke of the future.This is the most important of all. Otherwise the oceans of bloodshed will havebeen useless and outrageous. I propose the toast to the broad sunlight ofvictorious peace.&quot;Marshal Stalin.&apos;&apos; I am talking as an old man; that is why I am talking so much. But I want to drink to our Alliance, that it should not lose its character of intimacy,of its free expression of views. In the history of diplomacy I know of no suchclose alliance of three great Powers as this, when Allies had the opportunity of so frankly expressing their views. I know that some circles will regard thisremark as naive.&quot; In an alliance the Allies should not deceive each other. Perhaps that isnaive ? Experienced diplomatists may say : &apos; Why should I not deceive my Ally ? &apos;But I as a naive man think it best not to deceive my Ally even if he is a fool.Possibly our alliance is so firm just because we do not deceive each other, or is itbecause it is not so easy to deceive each other ? I propose a toast to the firmnessof our Three-Power Alliance, may it be strong and stable, may we be as frankas possible.&quot;
Marshal Stalin.&apos;&apos; For the group of workers who are recognised only during a war and whose services after a war are quickly forgotten. While there is a war thesemen are favoured and meet with respect not only of people of their own kind,but also that of the ladies. After a war their prestige goes down and the ladiesturn their backs on them.&quot; To the military leaders.&quot;Marshal Stalin.&quot;A change has taken place in European history, a radical change, during these clays. It is good to have an alliance of the principal powers during a war.It would not be possible to win the war without the alliance. But an allianceagainst the common enemy is something clear and understandable. Far more complicated is an alliance after the war for securing lasting peace and the fruitsof victory. That we fought together was a good thing, but it was not so difficult;on the other hand, that these days the work of Dumbarton Oaks has beenconsummated and the legal foundations laid for organising security and strengthening peace is a great achievement.   It is a turning point.&quot;I propose a toast for the successful conclusion of &apos; Dumbarton Oaks&apos;and that our alliance, born under the stress of battle, be made solid and extendedafter the war, that our countries should not become engrossed only in their own affairs but should remember that apart from their own problems there is thecommon cause and that they should defend the cause of unity with as muchenthusiasm in peace as during the war. For the consummation of : DumbartonOaks&apos;.&quot;M. Molotov.&quot; I propose a toast for the three representatives of the Army, Air Force and navy of the country which went to war before we did. They hacf a hard task and suffered heavily and we must recognise that they have accomplished their taskwell. I wish them success and a rapid end of the war in Europe so that the victorious Armies of the Allies .may enter Berlin and hoist their banner over that city. To the representatives of the British Army. Air Force and Navy,Field-Marshal Brooke, Admiral Cunningham and Air Marshal Portal and toFielcl-Marshal Alexander.Some Notes on the Private Talk at Dinner between The Prime Ministerand Marshal Stalin, 8th February, 1945.The Marshal, speaking of M. Gusev, said he was honest, but at the sametime heavy, &quot; a bear,&quot; he might tread on someone&apos;s toes and forget to apologise!But he was learning.With regard to the Finnish war in 1939, it began in the following way :the Finnish frontier was some 20 kilom. from Leningrad. (The Marshal oftencalls the city &quot;Petersburg.&quot;) The Russians asked the Finns to move it back30 kiloms., against which they offered territorial concessions in the north : the finns refused. Then, some Russian Frontier Guards were shot at by the Finnsand killed. The Frontier Guards detachment complained to Red Army troops,who opened fire on the Finns.   Instructions were asked for from Moscow.  These
contained the order to return the fire. One thing led to another and the war was on.  The Russians did not want a war against Finland.If the British and French in 1939 had sent a Mission to Moscow containingmen who really wanted to reach agreement with Russia, the Soviet Governmentwould not have signed the Pact with Ribbentrop.Ribbentrop told the Russians in 1939 that the British and Americans were only merchants and would never fight.Marshal Stalin, speaking of the alliance of the three Great Powers said :-&quot; If we, the three Great Powers, now hold together, no other Power can do anything to us&quot;Speeches at Dinner at Vorontsov Villa on 10th February, 1945.The Prime Minister.I propose the health of His Majesty The King, the President of the UnitedStates and President Kalinin of the U.S.S.R., the three heads of the three States.The President.The Prime Ministers toast recalls many memories. In 1933 my wife visiteda school in our country. In one of the class-rooms she saw a map with a largeblank space on it. She asked what was the blank space and was told they werenot allowed to mention the place it was the Soviet Union. That incident wasone of the reasons why I wrote to Kalinin asking him to send a representative to washington to discuss the opening of diplomatic relations. That is the historyof our recognition of Russia.The other gentleman mentioned in the Prime Minister&apos;s toast, His majesty the King, is an old friend of mine. I knew him as a young officer in the royal navy.  He is a great gentleman and the Queen a great lady.The Prime Minister.I should like to propose the health of Marshal Stalin, a toast which I havedrunk on several occasions. This time I drink it with a warmer feeling than atprevious meetings, not because he is more triumphant, but because the greatvictories and the glory of the Russian arms have made him kindlier than he wasin the hard times through which we have passed. I feel that, whatever differencesthere may be on certain questions, he has a good friend in Britain. I hope to seethe future of Russia bright, prosperous and happy. I will do anything to help and I am sure so will the President. There was a time when the Marshal wasnot so kindly towards us, and I remember that I said a few rude things about him,but our common dangers and common loyalties have wiped all that out. The fireof war has burnt up the misunderstandings of the past. We feel we have a friendwhom we can trust and I hope he will continue to feel the same about us. I prayhe may live to see his beloved Russia not only glorious in war but also happy inpeace.The Secretary oe State proposed the health of M. Molotov and referredto his first visit to Russia ten years ago, since when he had always foundM. Molotov to be a loyal friend even if they had differed on some questions.Later he proposed the health of Mr. Stettinius.
