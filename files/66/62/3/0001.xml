naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   A convoy has arrived in North Russia without loss.Coastal craft have successfully attacked enemy shipping in the northernAdriatic.Northern Waters.2. A convoy of 28 ships, escorted by ships of the Home Fleet, has arrived in North Russian ports. On the 10th torpedo bombers made a determined butineffective attack on the convoy; seven Ju. 88 were destroyed. On the 13thH.M.S. Denbigh Castle (corvette) was damaged by an&apos;&apos;underwater explosion offKola and later sank.Norwegian Waters.3. On the night of the 8th 11 tugs and a salvage boat were taken fromFredrikstad by Norwegian patriots and brought safely across to Sweden. three other tugs, which had no steam up, were sunk.Home Waters.4. On the 13th M.T.B. 758 off Ostend captured a fishing vessel flying theBelgian flag and manned by German naval ratings, which was attempting tosupply the garrison a,t Dunkirk.On the 14th a fire broke out among M.T.B.s berthed at Ostend. Twelveboats were destroyed and there were some casualties.On the 12th H.M.S. Prinses Astrid (infantry landing ship) was damagedon striking the pier head at Calais, and on the following day H.M.C.S. Orkney(frigate) was damaged in collision in the Irish Sea.During the week ending the 11th, the combined British and U.S. dischargesthrough the liberated ports were approximately 109,000 men, 11,200 vehicles,395,000 tons of stores, 77,500 tons of petrol, and 59,000 tons of ammunition.Mediterranean.Western Mediterranean.5. During the week Allied warships have successfully shelled enemy targetson the French-Italian frontier. The U.S. destroyer McLanahan was damaged by enemy shore batteries near San Remo.On the night of the 7th/8th coastal craft sank two coasters off Savona andnext day torpedoed and probably sank a victualling ship in the same area.A driatic.6. On the night of the 7th/8th M.T.B&apos;s off the west coast of Istria sank a torpedo-boat and torpedoed a 3,000-ton ship which was later sunk by Beau-fighters in Parenzo harbour. On the night of the 12th/13th in the same areacoastal craft sank a large cargo ship, and on the following night they sank threeheavily armed enemy craft off Vignole Bay oh the eastern side of the Istrianpeninsula.Early on the 12th explosive motor-boats attacked the harbour &quot;at Split,causing damage to a landing-craft and slight damage to H.M.S. Delhi (A/a cruiser).   One E.M.B. was sunk by gunfire and two others exploded harmlessly.Dodecanese.7. On the 12th H.M.S. Exmoor (destroyer) sank a motor-launch from whicha party of Germans had landed on Niseros. Allied troops, which were sentimmediately from Symi, dealt effectively with the enemy and took 30 prisoners.East Indies.8. During January, all the available cruisers, destroyers, sloops, mine-sweepers and M.L&apos;s. were employed in helping the army off the Arakan coast.Cruisers covered and supported the landing at Akyab and on Ramree island and put the Royal Marines ashore on Cheduba Island.   Cruisers and destroyers
supported the advance in the Myebon area and along the Ramree coast. H.M.S.Queen Elizabeth (battleship) shelled enemy positions during the Ramree opera-tions, and H.M.S. Phoebe (cruiser) acted as mobile R.D.F. and fighter directionship until shore stations were established by the R.A.F. Aircraft from H.M.S.A meer (escort carrier) provided a spotting umbrella for H.M. ships. Sloopssupported the army in the Myebon area, and minesweepers, in addition to their(    regular work, helped to evacuate casualties from the various river operations.9. During a recent patrol in the Strait of Malacca H.M. S/M Subtle sankfour junks and probably torpedoed one or more coasters in convoy off the Nicobars.Pacific.10. During the night of the 5th/6th U.S. coastal craft sank a large luggeroff Cebu and a barge offBalayan Bay; over 60 Japanese were killed. On the8th 11 barges, a lugger, seven speedboats and a motor-launch were destroyed offSan Fernando. Patrol craft, during night operations off the Cebu coast,destroyed a small cargo ship and two laden barges and engaged enemy concen-trations on shore.11. The U.S.S. Ommaney Bay (escort carrier) and one minesweeper havebeen sunk by the enemy in the Philippines area. Ten U.S. aircraft carriers havenow been sunk since the beginning of hostilities.12. Australian naval and air forces combined in a two-day attack on enemy positions in the northern Halmaheras. Installations, stores, personnel andstrategical air strips were successfully attacked.13 On the 12th aircraft sighted a northbound enemy force of two battle-ships, one heavy cruiser and three destroyers east of Cape Padaran in southIndo-China. The battleships are believed to be the. Ise and Hyuga. On theprevious day a British submarine reported two enemy battleships and an uniden-justified ship N.E. of Singapore. -1.4. U.S. submarines have sunk 31 more Japanese ships consisting of a light cruiser, a gunboat, an escort vessel, 21 cargo ships, four transports and threetankers.Anti-Submarine Operations.15. Twenty-four attacks were reported during the week, of which 16 wereby warships, seven by shore-based aircraft and one by carrier-borne aircraft.None of these attacks is considered to have been promising.Enemy Intelligence.16. The koln was photographed in dock at Wilhelmshaven on the 8th andthe Nilrnberg was reported at Copenhagen on the 7th. lutzow, Eugen, Hipperand Scheer have been operating in support of the German forces in the easternBaltic.U-boats.17.   There is no appreciable change in the U-boat dispositions.The new constructional base at Farge (16 miles from Bremen) for the assembly and fitting out of the new pre-fabricated U-boats is nearing completion. Produc-tion of U-boats is not likely to start before March, and boats begun then could notbe operational before August; by the middle of this year, however, the shelterwould probably allow of the&apos; building of a large number of pre-fabricated boatswith almost complete immunity from attack.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18. Two ships in convoy from the White Sea were torpedoed in the approaches to Murmansk. A Belgian ship in convoy to Antwerp was torpedoed and sunk off Plymouth, and a small Dutch tanker was sunk, probably by a mine,off Margate.19. Shipping losses by enemy action in January amounted to 16 ships of74,619 tons, which show a reduction of about 30 per cent, on the previous month&apos;s figures. With the addition of marine casualties the total of losses from all causesamounted to 29 ships of 99,133 tons.    Ten ships of 48,726 tons were sunk by[29233] b
U-boats; five of them in the North Atlantic and five in U.K. coastal and adjacentwaters. Four ships of 16,352 tons were sunk by mines off the East and S.E. coastsof England. One ship was sunk by an E-boat off Dunkirk, and one ship was sunk by aircraft in the Philippines:Protection of Seaborne Trade.- 20. During January 24 convoys of 475 ships, including one convoy Of30 ships from North Russia, arrived in the United Kingdom without loss by enemy action. A further 176 ships from ten of these convoys proceeded direct to continental ports. Twenty-seven outward bound convoys of 705 ships, including one convoy of 36 ships to North Russia, reached their destinations without loss.Two convoys, originally of 71 ships, lost one ship each by enemy action beforearriving at their destinations.Allied Minelaying.i 21. Surface craft have laid mines in Home Waters, and Allied aircraft laidmines in the Baltic.Naval aircraft have laid mines off the Norwegian coast.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.22.   No enemy minelaying has been reported during the week.U.S. minesweepers have destroyed 44 mines in the Gulf of Cagliari, and upto the present 130. mines have been destroyed in the Corfu south channel.The mine totals are 6,346 ground and 8,643 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. It is estimated that over 55,000 tons of enemy shipping was sunk in norwegian waters during November and December as against some 31,000 tons for the previous three months.During the week ending the 10th February at least 50,000 tons of transportsarrived in Denmark from southern Norway.A description of the Mine Watching organisation which has recently closedclown is given in Appendix A.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.24. Progress has been made and ground gained by the Allies in 3 of the4 main sectors of the Western Front. In the Vosges enemy resistance west ofthe Rhine has ceased; in the Roer sector steady pressure has been made; andthe First Canadian Army has launched an offensive in the Nijmegen area whichhas made considerable gains. &apos;Southern Sector.25. Attacks by the First French Army on the northern and southern flanksof the German salient in the Vosges succeeded in isolating its western extremity.This pocket was then eliminated and the enemy withdrew under pressure, firstacross the Rhine-Rhone Canal and finally, on,the 9th, across the Rhine itself.This success results in a shorter and more easily defended front for the Allies.Central Sector. -26. In the Hagenau area the enemy remained on the defensive and the threat to Strasbourg has receded.The Third U.S. Army has widened the breach in the Siegfried defences inthe Schnee Eifel sector and. on the 10th captured Prum. A considerable salienthas thus been formed in the enemy&apos;s main defences in spite of the difficulties caused by adverse weather and the enclosed nature of the terrain.On the left of the Third U.S. Army, the First U.S. Army has. been engagedin bitter fighting for control of the Roer clams, enemy damage to which has
caused extensive flooding. The river has risen some 4 feet, and in places it isnow about 400 yards wide. U.S. forces have now eliminated all resistance west of the Roer.Northern Sector.27. Preceded by a heavy air and artillery bombardment the First CanadianArmy on the 8th went over to the offensive S.E. of Nijmegen. Ground has been gained between the Maas and the Rhine, the greater part of the ReichswaldForest having been cleared. Cleve and Gennep have also been captured. steady progress is being made by British and Canadian troops in spite of mud and widespread floods which have made maintenance of the forward troops a matterof extreme difficulty.Eastern Front.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Latvia.28. The Germans appear to be making efforts to evacuate some of their forces from Latvia for employment in the main battle areas. 3-4 divisions are believed to have been transferred since the Russian offensive opened; this would still leave a garrison of about 30 divisions.East Prussia.29. The pocket in East Prussia has been drawn tighter and on the 10ththe encircling arm was strengthened by the capture of Elbing. It is still notpossible to say how many divisions remain in East Prussia out of the originalgarrison of over 20 divisions, but it is possible that the enemy has been able to evacuate some forces by sea and also along the Frische Nehrung the narrowspit of land running N.E. from Danzig.Central Sector..30. Steady progress has been made in the direction of Chojnice and furtherwest the Russians are now engaged in broadening their main salient by pushingnorthward towards Stettin. In the rear of the Russian forces, the fortress town of Posen is still holding out, but on the 14th the fortress of Schneidemuhl wastaken by storm. In the area east of Berlin, unofficial German reports state that theRussians have several bridgeheads near Frankfurt and Kustrin. but there is no confirmation of this from the Russians.Along the Middle and Upper Oder, the Russians have now crossed the.riverin strength in two areas, N.W. and S.E. of Breslau. The attack in the latter area which began on the 6th between Breslau and Oppeln has now developed a bridge-head about 20 miles deep on a 50-mile front. The attack N.W. of Breslau beganon the 11th along a 100-mile front, and the spearheads of this force on the 14threached a point 70 miles from Dresden. The fortress of Giogau has been encircledand the fortress of Breslau has now only a narrow escape gap about 10 mileswide to the south-west.Southern Sector.  .31. The city of Budapest fell to the Russians on the 13th after a six-weeksiege; the Russians report the capture of 110,000 prisoners during the course ofthis fighting. The German element of the Budapest garrison was believed to haveconsisted Of 4 to 5 divisions (including elements of 2 panzer or panzer grenadier).General.32. A further 2 divisions from the west have been identified on the eastern front this month, making a total of 4 since the offensive began. In addition,one division previously in Italy has been identified by the Russians in Hungary&apos;.There is still no indication of the destination of the panzer division of 6 S.S.Panzer Army from the west which were believed destined for the Eastern Front&apos;Burma.33. On Ramree Island the town of Ramree was occupied by our troops onthe 8th and more than two-thirds of the island is now in our hands.Japanese counter-attacks in the Kangaw area have continued but indiminishing strength.[29233] b 2
In the area west of the Chindwin, our forces have advanced to within 4 miles of Pakokku, where they are in contact with, the enemy. Further south, allied troops on the 10th occupied the village of Seikpyu and on the 13th they effecteda successful crossing of the Irrawaddy 4 miles south of Seikpyu.Our forces have also crossed the Irrawaddy in the area 30 miles west of Mandalay. Preliminary reports indicate that the first objectives were gainedagainst negligible opposition. Further attacks have been launched against ourperimeters at Thabeikkyin and Kyaukmyaung, although here, too, the strengthof the attacks has diminished. During the heaviest of the attacks about 2 weeks ago, the Japanese employed 4 field batteries and 10 medium guns against our troops in the Kyaukmyaung bridgehead.  .In Northern Burma, Chinese patrols have reaShed a point 6 miles north ofNamtu.China.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)34. The Japanese continued their advance S.E. from Suichuan, and on the6th captured Kanchow.Philippines.Luzon.35. After some savage street and house to house fighting, 1 U.S. CavalryDivision and 37 U.S. Infantry Division have cleared the greater part ofNorthern Manila. All the bridges over the river, which flows through the centre of Manila, were blown up by the Japanese, but both these U.S. divisions havenow crossed to the southern part of the city, where street fighting continues.A column of 1 U.S. Cavalry Division has established contact with troops of11 U.S. Airborne Division in Southern Manila, while further troops of 11 U.S.Airborne Division have occupied the important naval base of Cavite.Strong U.S. reconnaissance patrols have thrust eastwards from the San Jose-Cabahatuan area; one of these patrols has reached-the coast at Dingalan Bay,without contact, while another has penetrated to within 5 miles of Baler.The main Japanese resistance has continued to be on the U.S. left flank,where fierce fighting, including Japanese counter-attacks, has taken place on a front stretching from Bosario in the north to San Jose. Troops of 32 U.S.Infantry Division have forced ia way through a pass to the N.E. of San Manueland established a road block on the main road leading to Northern Luzon at apoint 20 miles north of San Jose.Japanese casualties up to the 9th amount to 21,230 killed and 256 prisoners;in addition some 200 enemy tanks have been destroyed.AIR SITUATION,Europe.United Kingdom.36. Fighter Command flew 71 defensive sorties. Attacks against long-rangerocket sites are referred to in paragraph 38.Home Waters.37. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 1,072 sorties; 11 aircraft are missing.On the 9th, 30 Beaufighters, escorted by 12 Mustangs, attacked 8 shipsstationary in Ford Fiord (N. of Sognefiord). Of 10 F.W. 190&apos;s encountered afterthe attack had been made 3 were shot down and 3 damaged: 9 Beaufighters were shot down (6 by flak) and one Mustang failed to return. From photographs itappears that a destroyer was severely hit and a sperrbrecher was smoking aft ofthe bridge.During the course of other anti-shipping operations, a 2,500-ton ship was leftsinking S.E. of Altoen, and a motor coaster off the Frisian Islands was damaged.The E-boat pens at Ijmuiden were bombed with good results by small forcesof Lancasters and Fortresses.Bomber Command aircraft laid 269 sea-mines.
Western Europe.38. During the week ended dawn on the 14th&quot; aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air)flew 13,597 sorties and dropped 6,934 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawn onthe 15th Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew 7.435sorties and dropped 16,152 tons, while Fighter Command and the U.S. VIIIFighter Command flew 3,279 sorties. Seventy-four enemy aircraft were destroyed;188 Allied aircraft are missing.The weather experienced over the battle front was reasonably good through-out the week, except on the 12th, when it was so bad that the total number ofsorties flown by all the above commands was reduced to under 30.Adverse weather at home bases restricted operations in strength by heavy bombers to three nights and two days. On the night of the 8/9th bomber command aircraft delivered two attacks in clear weather on the synthetic oil plants at Politz; a total of over 1,600 tons was dropped, which left the wholetarget alight with fires visible from a distance of 100 miles; concentrated bombing(650 tons) was also carried out against a similar target at Wanne-Eickel. Onthe following day a force of 1,187 U.S. heavies was despatched which, amongst other targets, attacked, mainly with unobserved results, the railway centre atMagdeburg (550 tons), the synthetic oil plant at Lutzkendorf (516 tons), the arma-ment plant at Weimar (427 tons)&apos; and the railway viaducts at Altenbeken,Arnsberg and Bielefeld (520 tons). In the course of these operations the onlyserious enemy opposition by day to be experienced during the week was encountered, some 200 enemy aircraft being sighted, of which the fighter escortdestroyed 19, whilst a further 37 aircraft were reported to have been destroyed on the ground, of which the majority were at Kolleda.On the night 13th/14th the first heavy attack of the war on Dresden was delivered. The bombing was well concentrated and 1,471 tons of H.E. and 1,175tons of incendiary bombs were dropped, leaving the town well ablaze with smokerising to 15,000 feet. The synthetic oil plant at Bohlen (11 miles S. of Leipzig)was also bombed (756 tons) the same night.The night&apos;s attack on Dresden was followed up by Fortresses dropping689 tons on the town on the following day, when the rail centres of Chemnitz(642 tons) and Magdeburg (725 tons) were the other two principal targets ofthe day. Chemnitz was again heavily attacked during the night of 14th/15thwhen 2,104 tons were dropped through cloud. Concentrated bombing (825 tons)on the synthetic oil plant at Rositz (21 miles S. of Leipzig) was also carried out.It is to be noted, that over 4,000 sorties were flown by aircraft of Bomber Com-mand and the U.S. VIII Bomber Command during the 36 hours ended dawn onthe 15th.Other operations by heavies during the week included an attack throughcloud on the railway centre at Hohenbudberg (633 tons) and four attacks againstthe oil depot at Dulmen in the course of which over 1,000 tons were released.Mosquitoes, in strength of between 42 and 78 aircraft, bombed Berlin (twice),Hanover, Stuttgart and Magdeburg.On the battle front bombers of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) attacked communications,enemy movements, defended villages and other objectives. The best resultsreported were those from attacks carried out by Stirlings and Halifaxes on enemybillets and communication centres on the 2nd British Army front, by Mosquitoeson the towns of Geldern and Viersen and by U.S. mediums on the communicationcentres of Geldern, Kavelaer, Eschweiler and Golzheim. Fighter-bombers and fighters provided close support for Allied troops, attacked a variety of targets and flew offensive sweeps; some 5,500 such sorties were flown over the northernsector of the front and successful missions include those which inflicted much damage on three enemy headquarters and which destroyed the railroad bridge atNeuss; about 3,850 sorties were flown on the central sector, the espionage school at Rauenthal being destroyed on the 13th, whilst about 2,750 were flown on thesouthern sector. Over all sectors about 900 locomotives and more than11,000 rail and road vehicles, including many horsedrawn, are reported to havebeen destroyed or damaged.Fighter Command flew over 150 sorties against long-range rocket installations in Holland, in the course of which 21 Spitfires scored hits and many near misseson the liquid oxygen factory at Hague/Loosduinen which resulted in a largeflash, clouds of orange and blue smoke and many explosions.Enemy offensive activity over the battle areas continued to be on a negligiblescale, and only some 50 tactical fighters operated on such days as weatherpermitted. Night fighter opposition to the attacks of Bomber Command did notexceed 150 /.200 sorties on any one night.(Note. Appendix VII gives Raid Assessments.)
Southern Europe.39. In the week ended dawn on the 13th,. aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew7,779 sorties, of which 1,519 were by heavy bombers, and dropped 4,846 tons of bombs.  Fifteen enemy aircraft were destroyed and 68 Allied aircraft are missing.The weather improved, operations only being severely restricted on one dayof the week.Bombers of the Strategic Air Force obtained good concentrations on the.rail centre at W. Verona (180 tons), on the oil stores at Pola and on the harbour at Trieste.In Austria, 5 oil refineries near Vienna were attacked (1,133 tons) and alsorailway centres to the S.E. of that city (911 tons), all with unobserved resultsAccurate bombing is; however, reported from small-scale attacks on Graz, and onthe airfield at Zwolfazing.The main effort of the Tactical Air Force continued to be directed against enemy communications in Northern Italy, particularly on the Brenner route,whilst close-support operations were also maintained. Successful attacks by nightwere carried out by Bostons, whilst Mitchells scored hits on a number of bridges.Operations by fighter-bombers and fighters resulted in railway lines being cut in about 200 places, in damage to about 50 bridges, and in the destruction ofover 250 rail and road vehicles.In Yugoslavia, aircraft of the Balkan Air Force attacked shipping near Senjand railway and communication targets in the areas of Zagreb, Maribor, Sarajevoand Karlovac. Aircraft operating from Greece dropped leaflets over certain of the Dodecanese Islands.Russia.40. No details are known of the scale of operations undertaken by theRussian Air Forces in support of their armies. There has also been little newsregarding G.A.F. activity on the Eastern Front; it would appear, however, that operations have been only on a moderate scale, possibly due, in part, to shortageof fuel.Far East.Burma, Si am and French Indo-China.41. In the week ended dusk on the 12th, Allied aircraft flew 3,789 sorties,including 2,365 by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition, Dakota transport aircraft fiew 5,578 sorties, carrying 4,696 men and 8,811 tons, and light transport aircraft flew 1,873 sorties, carrying 562 men and evacuating 533 casualties andmen.   Thirteen Allied aircraft are missing.In Central Burma, the Arakan and the North Shan States, tactical aircraftcontinued to co-operate closely with Allied troops, successful attacks being madedaily on enemy positions, communications and stores. Liberators dropped 309 tons .of bombs on artillery and troops at Singu and Myinmu (100 miles S.W. and40 miles west of Mandalay respectively).In Lower Burma and Siam, Super Fortresses and Liberators and fightersattacked communications and supplies. About 620 tons of bombs were dropped onbridges and yards on the Burma-Siam railways several bridges, including animportant one at Bangkok, were destroyed and tracks were destroyed in many places. In a daylight attack on supply dumps in the Rangoon area, 673 tons were dropped, causing considerable damage.In French Indo-China, Super Fortresses dropped 222 tons, through cloud,on the dockyard and the arsenal at Saigon.Japan.42. Ninety-seven Super Fortresses dropped 185 tons on an aircraft factory at Ota and 59 tons on other targets, with good results. Twenty enemy aircraft were destroyed and 46 damaged in combat; 11 Super Fortresses are missing.Pacific.43. In the Philippines, Liberators dropped 900 tons of bombs on fortifications-tions, gun positions and barracks on Corregidor and the Bataan Peninsula(Luzon).
In the Manila and other areas, Mitchells and Bostons attacked troop concentra-tions and supplies while fighters provided close support for Allied troops. attacks were also made on communications on Mindanao, an airfield on Negros and troop concentrations on Cebu.In Borneo, Liberators dropped 265 tons on three airfields, destroying severalaircraft on -the ground, and 30 tons on troops and oil installations at Miri andLutong. In the Celebes, small-scale attacks were made on mica mines, a radiostation and communications.Activity was on an increased scale in New Britain, New Ireland andBougainville, 650 sorties being flown, including 150 by heavy and medium bombers. The principal targets were airfields; supplies and camps in the Rabaularea.In the Kazans and Ogasawaras, Super Fortresses and Liberators dropped350 tons on airfields, gun emplacements and other targets. ,In Formosa, heavy bombers attacked an airfield at Takao and an airfield andbarracks atHeito; several aircraft on the ground and the barracks were destroyed.Off the coast, several small ships were sunk and a large ship was probably sunk.44. During the period 73 long-range rockets fell on land. This is thehighest recorded number since such attacks began.There were 33 incidents in London, with the majority east of a line WalthamHoly Cross/Lewisham; outside London there were 32.in Essex, 3 in Surrey,2 in Kent and 1 each in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Suffolk.There were 10 incidents in which more than&apos; 10 fatal casualties were recorded,including one with 31 fatal casualties, one with 28 and one with 26. The week&apos;total is the highest casualty roll from rockets yet recorded, but in over 60 percent, of the incidents casualties were negligible.45. A section of a Royal Ordnance factory has been closed (probably fora month) and at an important dock a fallen roadway bridge prevents all butshallow-draught vessels entering the dock. Three hospitals suffered serious damage and there has been temporary dislocation on railways.Apart from widespread blast damage, in few incidents were there more than10 houses actuallv demolished, but in the two incidents where casualties werehighest, 12 four-storey houses a,nd 20 houses, with a block of fiats, weredemolished.Casualties.46.

APPENDIX A,Mine Watching.The closing down of the Mine Watching in the ILK. brings to an end an organisation which was raised to meet a servicemenace. In the early part of 1941the enemy achieved considerable success in laying mines from aircraft in docks,basins and harbours in various parts of the country as well as in the eastern mediterranean and Suez Canal. The first step towards dealing with this menacewas considered to be the accurate spotting of the fall of such mines.A number of ratings of the higher age groups were specially recruited for thepurpose, the numbers at their peak reaching nearly 2,000. Officers with M/experience, but temporarily recommended for shore service, were put in chargeof the larger and more important posts, and their assistants were specially enteredor taken from recently-commissioned R.N.V.R. officers. The men were trainedto use bearing boards and frequently exercised, and they were also, trained inelementary seamanship, signals, boat work, dock clearance and small arms.It was obvious that this number of men could not supply coverage for thewhole of the ports round the coast, and steps were taken to enlist outside help.Later thousands of non-service men were employed. In the London river areaalone there were over 1,200 posts manned by R.A.F., Home Guard, and civiliansof all sorts, together with the crews of HM. and merchant ships. It was alsoin London that the experiment was made with W.R.N.S. minewatchers, and 75 ofthese were trained and housed in a depot at Richmond, from which they manneda number of posts from Westminster up, mostly guarding the river bridges; theyproduced excellent results and were most conscientious watchers.As,our defences got better and tb-e Allied air strength gradually equalledand then exceeded that of the enemy, the MW. force was reduced. It was maintained on the South and East coasts until the invasion had been in progress for some time, but the enemy was obviously unable to take advantage of the targets so provided, and it is now considered that he will not be able to do so inthe future.

Photographs taken on the 8th February, after the U.S.A.A.F. attackon the same day, and a great many attacks by smaller forces of Bomber CommandMosquitos on various dates cover the central area and parts of the southern,eastern and western districts of the town. Severe destruction is visible in the heart of the city, confirming strike photographs taken during the U.S.A.A.F.attack.In this area industrial and residential damage is heavy, and includes further damage to Government offices along the Wilhelmstrasse, the Air Ministry, the reich Chancellery, the Foreign Office, the Gestapo Headquarters, Goering&apos;office  in the Haus der Flieger, the Ministry of Transport and the State SecretArchives Office. Damage in the other areas ranges from moderate to severe, andmany scattered incidents can be seen. Railway targets hit include the Anhalterand Schlesischer Stations and the Tempelhof marshalling yards, and amongstindustrial plants affected are the A.E.G. Turbine Works (priority 1) and JuliusPintsch, torpedo components (priority 2).
Goch. Photographs taken on 10th February show that the bomber command tactical attack on the 7th/8th February has caused severe damage tothe town. While damage is widespread, the heaviest concentration has fallen inthe north-west section and the area adjacent to the marshalling yard, which hasitself been cut by three concentrations of bombs. Craters block all the streets inthat part&apos; of the town north of the Niers river and west of the railroad, whiledamage to business and residential property is heavy, several blocks of buildingshaving been completely destroyed.Magdeburg -Photographs taken on 8th February show that the greater partof the old city has been destroyed. This has resulted in the main from the bomber Command attack of 16th-7th January, and subsequent attacks byMosquitos of Bomber Command on 17th-18th January and by the ILS. &apos;8th AirForce on 3rd and 6th February have added to the damage. The area of devasta-tion is greatest within the limit of the old fortifications and extends northwardsfrom the Cathedral towards Neustadt. In this area nearly all the importantpublic buildings, including the Rathaus, the Municipal Theatre, the KaiserFriedrich and Natural History Museum and the large Ravensburg barracks havebeen destroyed. Smaller areas of devastation have been caused in the westernsuburb of Wilhelmstadt and at Neustadt in the north, and in both these areasindustrial damage is heavy. In the Buckau district the heavy engineering works of Friedrich Krupp shows many points of fresh damage, and there is considerabledestruction among hutments along the glacis of the old fortifications. heavy damage has also been caused in the railway goods yard, and the main station and several of the adjoining railway sheds have been gutted or destroyed. In the dock area there is much destruction among the trans-shipment sheds and warehouseslining the quays.M/mnheim. Photographs taken on 8th February show that the U.S.A.A.F.attack on 1st February caused further heavy damage to the Heinrich Lanz A.F.V.works, where the power station, a testing house, and a lathe shop have been gutted and two workshops severely damaged : a foundry, hot stamping and cuttingshops, turning shop, assembly shop and many other buildings have been affectedin varying degree. In addition a vehicle park and stores areas have been hit,and roads within the works considerably disrupted.Damage has also been inflicted on the adjoining factory of Joseph VogeleA.G. (makers of tank components, &amp;c), the rolling mills being severely damaged,a boiler house gutted, and the general engineering assembly shop further affected.Munich. A visitor to Munich in mid-January, shortly after the bomber command attack on 7th-8th, reports that the town was then a shambles with no gas, water or electric light. The streets had become mere footpaths and onlyin a few of the suburbs were there still some buildings left. All traffichad been brought to a standstill and public services had ceasedin the town itself as well as in some of the suburbs, while rail traffic was only possible as far as the suburb of Pasing. Informant adds that the only two reallybomb-proof shelters in Munich are reserved for Nazi &quot; Bonzen,&quot; and that no one is allowed to shelter there, even though bombs are falling in the immediate vicinity,without written permission.
