/TH1S DOCUMENT&apos; IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)   JggSECRETV/.P. UfcO5th March, 1 9U5WAR CABINETGRANT OF WAR &quot;GRATUITIES TO OFFICERS OF THEROYAL OBSERVER CORPSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for AirAt their meeting on 13th February (W.M.(45) 19thConclusions, Minute k)  the War Cabinet invited us toconsider further the position of Royal Observer CorpsOfficers and to submit a report setting out in greater detail the arguments for and against the grant to themwar gratuity and its probable repercussions.2. The Royal Observer Corps is an organisationadministered by the- Air Ministry but under the operational control of the Air Officer commanding-in-Chief, fighter command.      It is a uniformed and disciplined service.    Itspresent full-time strength is as follows:-Officers Other Banks- Observer Commodore (post 671 Chief Observersfilled by .ar Commodore)6 Observer Captains 768 Leading Gbsex-ver-sU1 &quot;       Commanders                    &quot; 8,539 Observers51 11       Lieutenants 1st Class104 11       Lieutenants 2nd Class233 &quot; ,     Officers3. &apos; The duties of the Royal Observer Corps are to observe,  identify and report to the R.A.F. all aircraft,etc., friendly as well as hostile, flying over GreatBritain.      The Corps forms an essential part of the air raid reporting system:    it supplies the air defence sectorsdirect with information which they need to enable them to intercept enemy aircraft and control air traffic, and itsupplies the information on which.Ministry of Home Securityofficials sound the public and factory air raid warnings.In addition it has functions in connection with aircraftsafety.      Its duties are operational in character.h. For Royal Observer Corps purposes, Great Britain is divided into UO Groups, each under an Observer Commander asGroup Commandant.      Each Group consists of (a) a number ofoutlying posts,  (b)  the &quot;centre&quot; or operations room into which the post observers pass their information, and (c) an administrative Headquarters.     Each post is directly undera Chief Observer but posts are linked together for highercontrol, an officer being responsible for about 12 posts.COPY NO.^^

In each centre, at least one officer is on duty throughoutthe 2k hours;    the officers are responsible for the efficient working of the centres.      Other Royal observer corps officers serve in R.h.F.   operations rooms where theyact as a link between the R.A.F.  duty &quot;controller and theRoyal Observer Corps..5. The pay of other ranks in the Royal Observer Corpsis linked to that of other ranks in the civil defence forces generally.      The Cabinet has already agreed that other ranks in the Royal Observer Corps should receivethe civil defence w,ar gratuity.6. The pay of Royal Observer Corps officers is not formally linked with civil defence pay.      TechnicallyRoyal Observer Corps officers, are treated for pay purposes has temporary civil servants,  as is&apos;shown by the fact thatthey receive the war bonus payable to civil servants.There was therefore felt to be some danger in allowingRoyal Observer Corps officers to participate in the civil defence gratuity scheme, which might involve infringing thegeneral principle that gratuities are not given to classeswho are paid on a normal civilian basis.      It is notclaimed, as has been claimed on behalf of the Women&apos;s land Army,  that the rate of pay is particularly low.      Onthe other hand it is true to say that the rates forRoyal Observer Corps officers are special rates, relatedpurely to their position in the Royal Observer Corps andthat they are not in fact out of scale with&apos; the ratesfor officers of the other civil defence services.7. The arguments in favour of the grant of gratuityare: -(a) Royal Observer Corps officers are recruited for theperiod of the war only and will be discharged atthe end of the war.      They are employed onoperational duties in uniform and underdiscipline.(b) They form the officer class of the Royal observer corps.      Other ranks in the Royal observer corps are to be given war gratuities and itwould be indefensible to treat the other ranksdifferently in this respect from the officers who command them. &apos;.&apos;(c) The fact that Royal Observer Corps officers may .technically be regarded as civil servants has no real significance in this connection.      their salaries were fixed on the present basis&apos; merely as a matter of administrative convenience,  toavoid the need for working out new conditions of. service for a relatively small class. &apos;   But theyare no better off on these salaries than theywould have been as officers of the FightingServices or as officers of one of the civil defence services;    if they had not been givencivil service war bonus it would have been necessary to increase their basic rates instead.&apos;Their rates,, including bonus, are not out of scale with civil defence rates.

5th March, 1945.(d) Their conditions of service are in many respects-materially different from those of civil servants of comparable status and are very similar to civil defence conditions.      Thus, they arerequired to work m wiaa t ever number of hours isnecess .r.y to cope with the work, without anyovertime payment, and to be on call at any hourof the day or night.      Members of the royal observer Corps (including officers) arespecifically covered by D.R.   29B under which theAir Council has made a &quot;freezing&quot; order andunder which a member may be prosecuted if he.   disobeys a lawful order or is absent from dutywithout a reasonable excuse.      Members of theRoyal Observer Corps are also compulsorilymobile. -(e) It will be necessary to retain the Royal observer corps on a voluntary reserve basis after the war,but the volunteers needed will not be forthcomingif the goodwill of the officers is laeicing, asit may well be if they feel  that they have beenunfairly treated in the matter of war gratuities.8.      &apos;   The Air Ministry are satisfied that the points inthe preceding paragraph are sufficient to distinguishclearly the Royal Observer Corps officers from&apos;other classes, such as R.A.F. Education Officers, who may wearService uniform while paid on a civilian basis.      royal observer Corps officers are not civilians in Serviceuniform, but members of a civil defence force-   in theirown uniform.      The; admiralty, War Office and Ministry ofLabour and National 3 err ice,  who have been - consul ted,agree that there is a strong case in equity for notdebarring,  on a technicality., the officers of the royal observer Corps from the gratuities which are being givento the civil defence services as a whole,  including theR.O.C.  other ranks.      It seems clear that any claims fromthe ^rmy Lands Staff or Audit Staff,  or Naval Store, etc.Officers, mentioned in W.P.(us) 84, paragraph 7, could be resisted on the ground that the RiO.C., officers are in essence civil defence personnel whereas the others aregenuinely and unmistakably civil servants, establishedor temporary.      Similarly,  there should be no reactionson the War Department Constabulary and other departmentalpolice forces which do not already arise from theinclusion of the War Reserve Police In the civil defencegratuity scheme,  though it has to be remembered that theDepartmental Constabularies are held under D.R.29B in thesame way as the R.O.C.      It also seems unlikely that theinclusion of the R.O.C.  officers can in itself materiallystrengthen the claims of Naval personnel on T.12h. agreements.These receive the recogrisec mercantile marine rates of pay, whereas the R.O.C.   officers receive ad hoc ratesregarded as appropriate for this particular civil defenceservice,9. We accordingly recommend to the War Cabinet thatRoyal - Observer Corps offjeers should be treated like other civil defence workers, rather than like civil servants,in regard to eligibility for war gratuity.J.
