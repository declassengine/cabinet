THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET. Copy No. 1W.P. (45) 121.28th February, 1945.WAR CABINET.WAR CRIMES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 8th September, 1944, the Chairman of the United Nations war crimes Commission forwarded to the Foreign Office the draft of a &quot; convention for the Surrender of War Criminals and other War Offenders &quot; which had beenprepared by the Commission and which, it was recommended, should be concludedbetween the Governments of the United Nations.. 2.   The preamble to this document defined its object as follows&quot; The purpose in view is to make it certain that the United nations will reciprocally transfer to one another persons in their power who. arewanted for trial as war criminals or Quislings, or have already been convictedon such charges, and to secure this result in the simplest possible way,avoiding the complications and delays of normal extradition procedure and,in particular, excluding the possibility of refusing surrender on the groundthat the acts charged have the character of political offences.&quot;It was recognised that several of the United Nations might require to enactspecial legislation if they were to accept the Convention.3. The Convention itself was to bind the Contracting Powers to surrender to one another persons charged with or convicted of war crimes committed withinthe jurisdiction of the requesting State or against that State or its nationals orarmed forces. The Contracting Powers were likewise to surrender to one anothernationals or former nationals of the requesting State charged with or convicted of assisting the enemy or of committing offences &apos;&apos; by means of the power -oropportunity afforded by a state of war or armed hostilities or by hostile occupationof territory of the requesting State.&quot; (These are the &quot;other War Offenders&quot;mentioned in the title of the Convention.) Such surrender was to be effectednotwithstanding any contention that the offence was of a &quot; political character.&quot;The Convention furthermore provided that a State might refuse to surrender itsown nationals or postpone surrender pending the conclusion of investigations orof proceedings. The remaining clauses dealt with the transmission of requests for surrender, the transit of surrendered persons through the territory of a thirdContracting Power, the production of documents and exhibits and the allocation of costs.4. The Draft Convention was considered by the Foreign Office in consultationwith the Home Office, the War Office, the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, the attorney-General and the Treasury Solicitor and agreement was reached on thefollowing points : (a) It was unlikely that there would be any legal or technical difficulty abouthanding over persons held as prisoners of war in British hands by arrangement with the other Allied authorities concerned.(b) As regards civilians, there would be no serious technical difficulty aboutpreventing aliens, known to be undesirable, from landing in thiscountry; or about handing over any already here, provided that theprocedure of deportation and not that of extradition were used.12683   [29323]
(c) Technical difficulties would, however, arise over deportation, since public and Parliamentary opinion might well question the propriety of this procedure in such cases.(d) These difficulties would be likely to increase as time passed, and moresearching questions would be asked two or three years hence than at. the present time; cases of quislings would cause more difficulties thanthose of war criminals.(e) It would be greatly preferable for deportation to take place on theinitiative of the British authorities or on receipt of informal informa-tion from Allied sources rather than upon a.formal request from an allied Government.(/) Any procedure so formal as that contemplated in the draft convention was, therefore, to be deprecated and, so far as the United Kingdom was concerned, the Convention would in practice hinder rather than assistthe object which the Allies have in view.(g) The Allies were, however, anxious to ensure that they would, in fact, beable to lay hands on all whom they considered they had a right to try,and that, when the time came, no difficulties should be placed in their way, for instance by the possible squeamishness of British publicopinion.(h) The wishes of the Allies would probably be met if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were to address a note to the Allied governments represented on the War Crimes Commission explaining why HisMajesty&apos;s Government were opposed to the draft Convention, butgiving an assurance that in practice no serious difficulty was likely to arise so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government were concerned about the surrender of war criminals on the one hand or of quislings on theother.(i) It was left to the Foreign Office to draft a note on the above lines for circulation to the Allied Governments concerned.5. The draft note has now been prepared and will be found at Annex &quot;A.&quot;The Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor, the. War Office, the Attorney-Generaland the Treasury Solicitor have expressed their agreement with its terms.6. It will be observed that the note is for circulation to those AlliedGovernments who are represented on the United Nations War Crimes Commis-sion. The Soviet Government are not represented on the Commission and cannot,therefore, be approached on the lines suggested in the case of the other AlliedGovernments. The Soviet Government, however, have expressed their desire todiscuss the question of the surrender of war criminals in the European advisory commission. Instructions on this subject are in process of preparation for theBritish representative on the European Advisory Commission and it is possiblethat the discussions will result in the conclusion of arrangements with the SovietGovernment similar in character to that which we have in mind in the case of theother Allied Governments.7. I propose, therefore, that the War Cabinet should agree to the despatch to the Allied Governments represented on the United Nations War CrimesCommission* of notes, the draft of which appears-in Annex &quot;A.&quot;A. E.Foreign Office, 28th February, 1944.* I.e., those of Belgium, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Luxembourg, theNetherlands, Norway, Poland, United States of America and Yugoslavia.
; ANNEX &quot;A.&quot; ;Draft Note to Representatives of Allied Governments.Your Excellency,HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have had under con-sideration the draft Convention for the surrender,of war criminals and otherwar offenders prepared by the United Nations Commission for the Investigation .of War.Crimes and submitted by them to the Allied Governments represented onthe Commission as Document C 47 of the 4th September, 1944.&quot; 2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have every sympathy with the object whichthe draft Convention is designed to achieve, namely, to facilitate and simplify the reciprocal transfer between the United Nations of persons in the territory ofone country and wanted by another for trial as war criminals or quislings. they recognise that this object accords with the spirit of the Declaration on german atrocities issued at Moscow on the 1st November, 1943, in which the principle was laid down that those implicated in such atrocities would &quot; be sent back tothe countries in which their abominable deeds were done in order that they maybe judged and punished according to the laws of these liberated countries and ofthe free Governments which will be erected therein.&quot;3. As one of the parties to the Moscow Declaration, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are firmly resolved that the guilty war criminals shall be sought out andpunished in accordance with its terms. They are most anxious to assist any oftheir Allies in bringing to justice war criminals responsible for offences against it own nationals or on its territory, and also its own nationals charged withtreachery to the State involving active assistance to the enemy.- His Majesty&apos;sGovernment appreciate that some of the United Nations concerned may find theconclusion of a Convention on the lines proposed by the Commission the most convenient means of achieving these objects. They have, however, reached theconclusion that, so far as they are concerned, the draft Convention does not represent an appropriate means of doing so. The procedure envisaged under thedraft would give rise in the United Kingdom to difficulties which in some casescould not be resolved without special legislation involving probably considerable delay. Moreover and this in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is the dominant consideration they are satisfied that their participation in theproposed Convention would in fact prejudice rather than assist the objects whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government, in common with their Allies, desire to achieve.4. It is, I think, generally agreed to be highly desirable that the processof trial of war criminals and quislings should be completed within a comparativelybrief period. On that assumption His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfiedthat the powers which they possess are sufficient to enable this matter to be dealtwith rapidly and satisfactorily by executive action, provided that it is kepton an informal basis and not made the subject of a formal treaty.5. Under existing law His Majesty&apos;s Government are empowered to repatriate by way of deportation any alien civilian if it is deemed to be conductive to the public good to do so, and they are prepared to treat as an undesirablealien civilian liable to deportation, any alien against whom there is a prima faciecase that he is a war criminal or has been guilty of treachery involving activeassistance to the enemy.6. As regards war criminals, His Majesty&apos;s Government would regard as an undesirable alien any alien civilian as to whom the War Crimes commission had reported that a sufficient case existed against the person concerned to justifyhis being brought to trial; where no such report had been made His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would desire to be satisfied that there is a prima facie case thatthe person concerned is a war criminal. As regards quislings, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would desire to be satisfied that the person concerned was a nationalof the Allied country desiring his surrender and that a prima facie case existsshowing that he had actively assisted a State at war with his own country.7. As regards war criminals or quislings who may be in the hands ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government as prisoners of war, the powers of the militaryauthorities ate sufficient to ensure their delivery to the Government concerned at a time to be agreed upon.   In such cases, His Majesty&apos;s Government will
desire to be satisfied in the manner set forth in paragraph 6 above that a prima facie case exists against the person concerned. In the event of a request forthe delivery of an individual being made by more than one Allied Government,His Majesty&apos;s Government would consult with the Governments concerned as tothe action to be taken.8. In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government do not feel able tobecome a party to the proposed Convention, though they would, of course, not wish to dissuade Allied Governments who might wish to participate in such aconvention from doing so. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom are satisfied that they are in a position to give effect, - in the manner indicated above, to the declaration made at Moscow on the 1st November, 1943, and thatin so far as the United Kingdom is concerned no additional conventional under-taking is required. I have now the honour to give your Excellency a formalassurance that it is the firm intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom to give effect to the declaration of Moscow by the exercise of the powersreferred to above, and to express the hope that the Government will be preparedto give His Majesty&apos;s Government a corresponding assurance as regards the reciprocal assistance which they will be prepared to give, by such means asthey may find appropriate, to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter.9. The above observations relate to persons who are, or may be found, inthe United Kingdom. The question of the surrender of persons who may havefallen, or may fall, into the hands of the Allied forces operating elsewhere is amatter to be dealt with by the Military Commander concerned,&apos; and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment understand that arrangements to this end are already in processof being made.
