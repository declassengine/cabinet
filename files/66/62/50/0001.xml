THIS DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S   GOVERNMENT.SECRET\7P(45)145March 7th 1945*WAR    cabinet united KINGDOM STOCK LEVELS//        COPY NO,200MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP WAR TRANSPORT.As the War Cabinet is aware, a Committee of the U.S.  state department under the Chairmanship of Mr.  Clayton recentljr proposedsubstantial reductions in the stocks of food and raw materials in thiscountry over the first six months of- 1945 as a contribution towardsbridging the gap between shipping availabilities and requirements.This report proceeded on certain assumptions  (e.g.  as to the end ofthe war) which did not accord with those agreed at &quot;Argonaut&quot;  and ignoedor gave insufficient weight to the situation as explained to the U.S.representatives here.The proposals reached us at a late stage and ait the close of the&quot;Argonaut&quot; Conference it was made clear to Mr.  Hopkins that the ClaytonReport was not acceptable to us.      Mr.  Hopkins  agreed to set it asideand, in view of the importance of placing our import programme on anunassailable basis,  it was agreed between the prime Minister andMr. Hopkins that a new survey of our stock levels should be undertaken at a higher level  is a matter of urgency.It is expected that, on the side of the U.S. , Mr. Hopkins himselfwill handle the matter, after a preliminary Investigation here with theDepartments in which Mr.  Philip Reed would probably act for him.There is everything to be gained by this procedure since it isessential once and for all to satisfy the Americans, on whom wedepend so largely for help,  that our requirements are reasonable andno iaore than reasonable.      Once this is done, the President would beasked to issue a Directive on the matter which would bind allU.S. Agencies - Military as well as Civil.The selection of the Minister from our side to deal withMr. Hopkins is a matter&apos;for the War Cabinet.      As the U. S.  intention is to entrust the negotiations only to someone who is independent of any departmental or service bias Mr. Hopkins hopes that wesimilarly will not select a Minister who is himself department allyconcerned with stock levels.L.6th March, 1 945*MINISTRY OF WAR TRANSPORT.March 7th T945.
