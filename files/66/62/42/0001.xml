THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot;Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 137.5th March, 1945.JWAR CABINET.ORGANISATION OF CIVIL AIRLINES.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.THE policy for Civil Aviation in W.P. (45) 118, is to eliminate competition and to prevent rivalries in the operation of British civil airlines.2. Yet, commercial rivalry and regulated competition is the foundation-stone of this industry. In the United States it has produced the most efficient and profitable airline organisation in the world. Indeed, the history of air transport shows that competition stimulates development and promotes swifter,cheaper, safer and more frequent services. But airline monopolies have led onlyto obsolescence in equipment and expense in operation.3. Competition is the firm basis on which new and improved types of air-craft can be built. A variety of customers impels the Aircraft Industry toproduce a variety of aircraft of constantly increasing performance. Competitionis the means by which the British Aircraft Industry can match the americans in manufacture and operation, thus providing employment on the widest scale.4. But, according to the new policy, the manufacture of civil aircraft inGreat Britain would depend in the future on a single source of demand throughB.O.A.C. Such a policy can never achieve the highest results. Competitionis the source of vitality to the industry, just as it has been in motor manufacturefor nearly half a century. A variety of customers creates a constant demand for more types and better types.5. On the operating side the proposed monopoly corporations can give nocompetitive motive for continuous technical development, for improvement of services or for reduction of fares. In any case the railways should be eliminatedbecause their interest lies, not in advancing Air Transport but in protecting theirrail services from loss of traffic to competitive airlines. By tying airline rates to those of land and water transport, fares will be kept high and progressrestricted.. 6. Civil Aviation requires a constructive, dynamic policy of action andachievement. The concentration of all technical knowledge, operating experience and manufacturing markets into monopoly corporations, can only strangledevelopment, paralyse expansion and reduce employment. British airlines mustcater, not merely for existing markets, but still more for the vastly increasedmarkets which only competition can attract.7. Nor is this just a commercial issue. Military Aviation derives its strength from Civil Aviation. Civil progress is a basis for military develop-ment. Civil air&apos; fleets provide a pool from which military transports can bedrawn when war comes.8. I ask the War Cabinet to approve a plan of regulated competition forthe orderly development of British civil airlines.B.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W. 1,5th March, 1945.[29361]
