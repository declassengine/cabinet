Copy No. O &quot;OV -  war CABINET.. CIVIL NURSING RESERVE POST-WAR SCHEME.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.THE Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries has submitted a Paper(W.P. (45) 120) outlining a special scheme for financial assistance for theWomen&apos;s Land Army.2. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 22nd February (W.M. (45)24th Conclusions, Minute 3), I pointed out that whole-time members of the CivilNursing Reserve had a claim to similar recognition. Those members who areemployed whole-time in the Civil Defence Services about 3,000 will be eligible for the Civil Defence gratuity and are not covered by this memorandum.The rest who number about 20,000 are not at present covered by any proposal.3. The principal arguments for giving to whole-time members of the CivilNursing Reserve at least the same recognition as is now proposed for theWomen&apos;s Land Army are (a) Like the Land Army, the Reserve is an organisation set up by a Govern-ment Department.   Recruitment began early in 1939, over six months before the outbreak of war.   Recruits are supplied with uniform by.the Department, who also prescribe the rates of pay and conditionsof service, though they do not directly employ the members.(6) The rates of pay for the basic grade nursing auxiliaries who comprisetwo-thirds of the members, were, until February 1941, the same as therates payable to members of the Civil Defence Services and are nowless favourable.(c) There is a very acute shortage of nurses at present, which is likely tocontinue for some considerable time after the war, and we havealready, in agreement with the Minister of Labour and NationalService, announced our intention of keeping the Reserve in being and continuing recruitment of all grades after the war. For some time past recruitment has been falling off, and it would undoubtedly fall offstill more if members of the Reserve were to labour under a sense of grievance that they had been unfairly treated.4. Members of the Civil Nursing Reserve are already writing to my Depart-ment on this subject. I consider that the Civil Nursing Reserve must be dealtwith on generally the same basis as members of the Women&apos;s Land Army, and thatit would be appropriate that announcements in respect of the Women&apos;s land army and the Civil.Nursing Reserve should be made simultaneously. AccordinglyI ask for approval to the terms of the attached Statement.H. U. W.Ministry of Health, S.W. 1,2nd March, 1945.SECRET.f       W.P. (45) 129.2nd March, 1945.[29341]
1Draft- Statement .by Minister of Health.Members of the Civil Nursing Reserve employed whole-time in the civil defence Services are eligible for the same post-war assistance as other membersof the Civil Defence Services.   &apos;2. The Government recognises that members of the Reserve employed inother nursing services have, often under the most difficult and arduous conditions,given invaluable assistance without which it would have been impossible tosurmount war-time difficulties, and that their services will continue to be requiredfor a considerable time after the war. They propose, accordingly, to make towhole-time members of the Reserve as to members of the Women&apos;s Land Army who are released from the Reserve after the (same date as forWomen&apos;s Land Army) with the approval of the Minister of Health, an outfitallowance of  12 10s., if they have given satisfactory whole-time service for notless than six months; and for those members who undertake to continue whole-time in the Reserve for not less than a year after the defeat of Germany, to pay,on completion of service, a cash bonus at the rate of 4*. a month for each monthof service, but subject to a minimum period of six months&apos; service. The detailsof the arrangements will be announced in due course..3. Members of the Reserve are eligible to participate in the schemes forfurther education and training which have been announced.
