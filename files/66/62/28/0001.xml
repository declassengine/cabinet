THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.Copy No.WAR CABINET.THE WOMEN&apos;S LAND ARMY AND CIVIL NURSING RESERVEPOST-WAR AND WELFARE SCHEMES.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.THE Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries is asking (W.P. (45) 120) forapproval of the terms of a statement embodying a special scheme for the Women&apos;s land Army which he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have worked out, on lines indicated by the War Cabinet. I understand that similar proposals are under consideration for the Civil Nursing Reserve.2. I have no strong objection to the scheme which has been worked out.In connection with the Women&apos;s Land Army I would say,&apos; however, that it is not wholly fair to suggest that the &apos;fall in the number of applications for enrolmentin the Women&apos;s Land Army is a result of &quot;the present uncertainty.&quot; my information is that the total numbers of girls enrolled have been falling fairlysteadily ever since January 1944 and had therefore begun to fall some time before&apos;&apos; the present uncertainty &apos;&apos; can possibly have affected recruitment.3. The chief consideration which I wish to put forward is one of greatimportance and one which I think must be squarely faced before a firm decision is taken on the proposals now under discussion. I have more than once venturedto express the opinion that if any concession is made to the Women&apos;s Land Armythere will inevitably be representations from other sources which will be difficultto resist.4. In particular it would be very difficult to resist any representations whichmight emanate from the following : (a) Land girls who are not members of the Women&apos;s Land Army.   Largenumbers of these have applied to join the Land Army but have notbeen allowed to do so as they were already employed in agriculture.(b) Women railway workers.   These women have had to wear uniform andmany of them worked through the period of continuous air-raids.   ,(c) Omnibus conductresses.   These again are uniformed workers, many ofwhom worked through the air-raids.(d) Coalmining ballotees.   I am already being strongly pressed to makesimilar concessions to these workers and do not see how their claimscould be rejected if those of the Women&apos;s Land Army were allowed.These young men may be said to have a stronger claim as they havebeen told that their service in coal-mining is equivalent to service inthe Forces.(e) The Merchant Navy.   Any claim on behalf of this Service would receivethe strongest public support.(/) Mechanised Transport Corps.   This again is a uniformed Corps and its position   cannot  be   distinguished   from   that   of   the   Women&apos;s.Land Army.5. Apart from the groups of workers which I have mentioned above, Ishould expect representations on behalf of ordinary industrial workers both menand women. It could be argued on their behalf that they have been subject tocontrol either by direction or by the Essential Work Order; their jobs have often been extremely arduous and dirty and, not uncommonly, dangerous. In[29332]SECRET.W.P. (45) 123.1st March, 1945.
addition they have had to buy their own working clothes, using their own money and their own coupons for the purpose.6. I understood that similar concessions are under consideration for theCivil Nursing Reserve. If it is decided to grant such concessions it will be evenmore difficult to resist representations from the groups of workers which I havenamed above and almost impossible to withhold the concessions from studentnurses and student midwives who, in my view, have a far better claim thanmembers of the Civil Nursing Reserve.7. In all the circumstances, therefore, I feel it my&apos;duty to draw attention,once again, to what I consider would be the inevitable repercussions of theproposals to make special concessions to the Women&apos;s Land Army and the CivilNursing Reserve. These repercussions would,&apos;I am convinced, quickly reachunmanageable proportions, forcing the Government to unprecedentedly costlymeasures.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,1st March, 1945.
