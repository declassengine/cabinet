(45) 114.2Ath February, 1945.WAR CABINET.PRIORITIES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,Note by the Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate herewith an exchange of minutes between the Prime Minister and the Minister of Aircraft Productionwith reference to W.P. (45) 29.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2Ath February, 1945.PRIORITIES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.&apos; (1)Copy of a Minute from the Minister of Aircraft Production to the PrimeMinister, dated the 22nd January, 1945.You state that those Service Research and development projects now in handwhich are not likely to be used in operations on a considerable scale in thesecond half of 1946 should be slowed down or temporarily abandoned.I assume that this does not cover the normal research and developmentessential to keep us ahead in types of aircraft, engines, &amp;c.If we were to slow this down or abandon it we should very gravely jeopardise .our whole position in the air for many years to come, since once we lost ourposition we could never in peace time catch up again on other nations.Will you let me know whether I am right in this assumption?(Initialled) R. S. C.(2)Copy of a Minute from the Prime Minister to the Minister of Aircraft Production,dated \Ath February, 1945.You wrote to me about the relation of my directive on research and develop-ment to the normal programme for research and development in aircraft and aircraft engines. Certainly I do not suggest that.we should slow down or abandonany such work. I had in mind rather all the relatively long-term projects nowjostling one another for first claim on scientists and draughtsmen. In these, Ithink^ the general rule must hold that priority be given to munitions likely to beused in the Japanese war and that others must take their turn with due regard for the broader needs of the country.(Initialled) W. S. C.Copy No, 3[29274]
