THIR.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY.OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTECR. E Ttm (^5) 11.5. I   COPY NO.. ,  , jjh-tb. February , 19^5. -WAR      CABINET&apos;  PROPOSAL TO ACCREDIT ANDREW ROTHSTEIN TOS.H.A.E.F.Memorandum by the. Minister of Information.I..      In my opinion the Tass Agency&apos;s application for theaccreditation of Mr.  Rothstein as a war correspondent with 21stArmy Group ought to be granted.&apos;      It is important to be clear asto what a refusal would mean.2.      The. application is made by the Tass Agency, which is an.official organ of the Soviet Government.      Mr. Rothstein is an employee of theirs of long standing and until recently he washead of their London bureau.      They may not -unreasonably claim that he is one of their most responsible men.      For two yearshe has been President cf the Foreign Press Association in thiscountry, which certainly gives him standing, and he is widely known and respected among journalists-here.      He has been resident for many years and, so far as I know, nothing whateveris kncwn against his good faith or his personal   reliability.His. general attitude towards this  country and its war effort,as shown by his articles,  is friendly.3.      The Tass Agency wish tc send him to Brussels as theirstanding political correspondent.      It is not their in tentionto use him as a war correspondent,  the necessity for accreditationarising merely from the fact that Belgium is still under ameasure of Allied military control. -&apos;4.      To refuse the official Russian agency the right tc nominatethis correspondent for this purpose in these circumstances seems,to me impossible.      That it would have the most harmful effecton our efforts to advance the work of British publicity in theU.S.S.R,  I cannot doubt.      That work has been pursued,  In spiteof many difficulties, with a heartening measure of success andit is my hope that the War Cabinet will not expose it to thisavoidable injury.B. B,Ministry of Information,2hVci February, 19U5.(
