THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 108.22nd February, 1945.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY 1945 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND MAN-DATED  TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.THE principal item of domestic news during January was the controversyover the conscription policy. This focussed interest throughout Canada on the by-election at Grey North by which General McNaughton, Minister of Defence,hoped to enter the House of Commons, and also on the widespread resentmentat the high level of default amongst troops due to report for embarkation asreinforcements. The by-election became the centre of interest, not only on accountof the outspoken attacks levelled at the Government by the Opposition candidates,but also as a result of the personal intervention of the Prime Minister. the progressive Conservatives and the C.C.F. failed to respond to Mr. mackenzie king&apos;s wish that General McNaughton should be returned unopposed, and theynominated respectively Mr. Case and Air Vice-Marshal Godfrey as their candi-dates. The Prime Minister reserved the, decision whether or not parliament should meet again, after the session had been closed on the 31st January, pendingdevelopments in the by-election, and this statement was interpreted to mean that, if General McNaughton were defeated, a general election would be held.The Prime Minister is thought to be steadily building up a case which wouldenable him to place the onus of responsibility on the Opposition parties if ageneral election is called, and it may be that he has made up his mind that anearly election would best suit the interests of the Liberal Party. In the event,the Progressive Conservative candidate, Mr. Case, won the election by a com-comfortable majority. It has been announced that a general election will be held before the 17th April.2. The military authorities are endeavouring to place in perspective thedefault of troops due to embark. Some 6,000 out of 15,000 former Home defence troops absconded to avoid overseas service. The authorities then announcedthat severe disciplinary measures were to be instituted, and they assured thepublic that every step would be taken to ensure that the full quota of reinforce-ments required for the Canadian Army overseas reached the United Kingdom.3. The problem of the amendment of the Constitution, which is to regulateFederal and Provincial relations, will become pressing with the expiry of thespecial war-time powers exercised by the Federal Government at the end of thepresent emergency, and the Federal Minister of Finance has announced that aConference wiil be held after the general election. The Conference, which was proposed last year, was cancelled by the Federal Government owing to the opposi-tion of the Premier of Ontario, Colonel Drew, who has now urged that it shouldbe held without delay, but any hopes that he had modified his views on the subjectwere quickly dispelled by his bitter attack on centralisation at Ottawa. this attitude has somewhat altered the feeling of Quebec towards him, for, previouslydenounced as an enemy of French-Canada, favouring conscription and hostile[29281] b
to family allowances, he is now regarded as a stout defender of Provincial rights.M. Duplessis, the Premier of Quebec, has followed the same theme asColonel Drew.4. The dispute between the Government of Saskatchewan and the federal government over the repayment of advances made by the Federal Governmentfor seed grain continues. The Federal Minister of Finance recently invited thePremier-and the Provincial Treasurer to discuss the matter in Ottawa: .no reply was received to this, and the Minister has now warned the provincial government that they must meet his suggestions for settlement by the31st January or the Canadian Government will take whatever steps are necessaryto collect the amounts due.5. The Government have introduced a change in the machinery of war-timewage control which will provide for a greater flexibility in the level of salaries,and a new order removes many of the existing anomalies in the lower income groups.6. The Canadian Government have announced that they will participate inthe Commonwealth Air Transport Council, and they have also announced their intention to accept the interim agreement drawn up at the Civil AviationConference at Chicago.7. Following on the Pcpe&apos;s Christmas message, Cardinal Villeneuve ofQuebec issued a warning against the Communist &quot;menace,&quot; and this has been followed by a solemn declaration, signed by the faithful that the courageouspart played in the war by the Russian people must not blind them to the worldrevolution&apos; which the leaders of international communism always seek.8. Considerable publicity has been given to the visit of Mr. Bracken,leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, to the United Kingdom, and thewar zone in Belgium and Italy.9. Mr. R. S. Hudson, United Kingdom Minister of Agriculture, paid a brief visit to Ottawa and Toronto, and had informal discussions with Canadian ministers and officials on agricultural problems.10. Mr. C. W. G. Gibson, Minister of National Revenue, has succeededMr. A. L. MacDonald as Acting Minister of National Defence for Air, no permanent successor to Major Power having yet been appointed.11. Sir William Glasgow, High Commissioner for the Commonwealth ofAustralia, has completed his term of office. Lieutenant-Colonel W. R. Hodgson,formerly permanent head of the Department of External Affairs at Canberra, istemporarily acting as High Commissioner.12. Mr. Robert Jones is acting as the Accredited Representative of theUnion of South Africa in Canada.13. A Canadian delegation, headed by Mr. Paul Martin, M.P.,Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister for Labour, attended the I.L.O.Conference in London. -Economic.14. An Import Division of the Canadian Department of Trade and commerce has recently been established, one of the main purposes of which will,it is undestood, be the encouraging of imports from the United Kingdom duringthe post-war period.15. The decision to set up an organisation of this nature can be attributed to a growing realisation in Canadian Government circles that it will be essential for the dollar earnings of the sterling area to be increased if Canada&apos;s exporttrade with the sterling area is to be maintained after the war at a satisfactorylevel.16. It cannot be said that there is as yet any real appreciation of the hardfacts of the dollar position among the general public in Canada, but some public concern is being expressed in the Press and in commercial circles at the prospect that when the war is over the United Kingdom may seek to curtail its importsfrom North America on the grounds of dollar shortage. In the light of thisanxiety, a special significance has been seen in recent United Kingdom pro-nouncements on agricultural policy after the war; the fear is expressed that amuch higher level of home production may be maintained as one means of reducing dollar expenditure on imported foodstuffs.
Service Activities.17. H.M.C.S. Algonquin and. Sioux&apos;formed part of the escort for a convoy from the United Kingdom, which reached North Russia on the 8th. They alsoformed, part of the escort for the return convoy from Russia to the UnitedKingdom.18. On the 14th H.M.&apos;s Canadian-manned Corvette Trillium was damaged in collision with a trawler while escorting a convoy off the Welsh coast, but was able to proceed to port.19. On the 22nd H.M.C. Corvette Lindsay was damaged in a collision with a destroyer off the south coast but returned to port without assistance.20. On the 28th H.M.C.S. Algonquin and Sioux formed part of the coveringforces to the escort carriers from which aircraft operated to attack shipping in the Rovde Fiord, approximately 120 miles north of Bergen.21. In Italy, on the Eighth Army front, Canadian forces went over to the offensive on the morning of the 2nd in the area east of Alfonsine. Supported byarmour, our troops forced the enemy, after heavy armoured fighting, to withdraw to the north bank of the Canale Bonifaca, Two days later Canadian armouredunits secured two small bridgeheads across this canal south of Lake Comacchioand, after dealing with a counter attack, pressed on to San Alberto which was occupied on the following day without opposition. During the next two days the advance was continued, and by the 6th their forward positions had reachedthe south bank of the River Reno and the flooded area between Ravenna andLake Comacchio had largely been cleared.. 22. While, the operation referred to in the preceding paragraph was takingplace Canadian infantry, in conjunction with a British formation, wereadvancing from the area north of Highway 9 and were squeezing out the enemysalient east of Cotignola and Solarola.23. These operations were so successful that by the 8th our forward positionslay along the east bank of the River Senio and for the remainder of the monthnothing but patrolling activity has been-reported from the Canadian sector ofthis front.24. A total of 43 R.C.A.F. squadrons were operational overseas during themonth of January; 23 in the United. Kingdom, 17 on the Continent, one in Italyand two in Burma. In addition the second of the three R.C.A.F. (Air O.P.)Squadrons has now been formed and the third will be formed by the 3rd ofMarch, 1945.25. Heavy bombers of No. 6 R.C.A.F. Group flew 1,345 sorties during themonth of January, which compares with 1,917 flown in the previous month.The lower number of sorties carried out is mainly attributable to adverse weather .conditions during the last two weeks of the month. Losses for the month totalled29 compared with 18 in December, while targets for the Group were factories,oil refineries and marshalling yards in Germany, and tactical targets in supportof the Allied Armies were also attacked. Squadrons in the Group claim a totalof eight enemy aircraft shot down and three damaged for the period underreview.26. Beaufighters, Sunderlands and Wellingtons of R.C.xAx.F, Squadrons in coastal Command flew 1,805 operational hours without loss. 404 BeaufighterSquadron, operating with other R.A.F. coastal squadrons, attacked and sank a700-ton merchant vessel and seriously damaged two other motor vessels of 2,500tons and 1,200 tons, while rocket projectile strikes damaged a minesweeper and&apos;set a trawler on fire.27. R.C.A.F. squadrons of the Second Tactical Air Force flew 2,925 sorties,which shows a decrease on the number flown for the preceding month, butincreased German activity, in particular on the morning of the 1st, accounted forthese squadrons destroying 69 enemy aircraft, probably destroying six more and damaging 19 for the loss of 30 of our own aircraft.28. Of the three Canadian squadrons in Fighter Command two flew 54sorties, while the third, in an unreported number of sorties, destroyed three enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a fourth without loss.-[29281] b 2
29. During the month the three Canadian squadrons in Transport Com-mand, two of which are located in Burma, flew 3,379 sorties carrying freight and supplies to the forward theatres of war for the loss of three aircraft.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.30. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester were given a warm welcome ontheir arrival at Sydney on the 29th January. His Royal Highness was subsequently sworn in as Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief on thefollowing day. The Governor-General&apos;s first official engagement will be theopening of a new session of Parliament on the 21st February. The significance of the appointment of a Royal Goveror-General at the request of an AustralianLabour Government is noted by the Press.31. After nearly two months&apos; absence owing to illness Mr. Curtin, thePrime Minister, resumed duty on the 22nd January and was given a very warmreception by the House.32. In a speech on the 26th January Mr. Forde, the Deputy Prime Minister,mentioned Australians contribution to the war effort. Nearly 1 million men hadenlisted out of a population of 7,300,000, while 50,000 women were in the auxiliary Services. The actual total of 975,000 men serving at Decemberrepresents 2 out of every 3 men between the ages of 18 and 40. Mr. Fordeconcluded his speech by stressing the urgent need for an increase in populationafter the war. &quot; There is no reason,&quot; he said, &quot; why we should not aim at a population of, say, 20 million within two decades. The immigrants we want arechildren and young men and women. British Service men and women will be welcomed.&quot; .33. Mr. Forde has also announced that the Commonwealth Government will assist ex-Service men who wish to settle on land other than through Governmentschemes. Proposals recently approved by the Cabinet cover Service men returning to their own farms, and those seeking to obtain farms by private purchase.34. The formation of a Cultural Council to promote cultural development in Australia is planned by the Ministry of Post-War Reconstruction. Whenestablished, the Council will operate within the Department of Post-war reconstruction, and its objects will embrace such projects as the establishmentof a national orchestra in addition to the present State orchestras, the encourage-ment of art and the provision of travelling exhibitions.35. Plans are also being prepared for inclusion in the National Library at canberra of microfilm facsimiles of rare documents in British, European and american Libraries.36. As soon as is practicable after the war the Federal Government intend to establish an Australian Mint at Canberra, where provision will be made forrefining gold. It is not known whether the Melbourne branch of the Royal Mintwill continue to operate.37. The Prime Minister&apos;s support of the nationalisation policy in civilaviation is attacked in the daily newspapers as dishonouring his personal pledgeagainst &quot; socialisation.&quot; &quot; The one vested interest which no Prime Minister candisregard is the vested interest of the people in seeing that the contracts enteredinto by a political party seeking election are kept.&quot;38. A fund, which now exceeds  140,000, has been raised in Australia toprovide scholarships at universities and schools, as a tribute to the services toAustralia of Lord Gowrie, lately Governor-General, and his wife.Economic.39. In a statement made on the 8th January, the Acting Prime minister referred to the devastating effect of the drought on Australia^ food productionand particularly on the production of cereals and hay. Fortunately, the wheatstocks, if care was exercised in their use, should see Australia through until thenext harvest at the end of 1945, even allowing for very heavy use for stock feed,&quot;which was at present at the rate of 60 million bushels annually, i.e, over seventimes the pre-war rate.
40. The record meat production of 1944 had been used for Australiancivilians and Services, United States Services and British civilians and Services.Because of the very heavy, commitments to the Services, chiefly the United StatesServices, Australia was unable in 1944 to supply Britain with meat on the peace-time scale. It was hoped to maintain supplies to British civilians and services in 1945 at levels not much lower than 1944, but, with estimated production in 1945considerably less than 1944 because of the drought, it was inevitable that UnitedStates Forces would be required to secure more of their meat from theUnited States. It might be found also that some review of Service ration scales of meat would be necessary.41. In spite of the drought, it was hoped that with normal rains during1945 dairy production would revive to a level not much lower than that of 1944.On that basis supplies of dairy products to the United States Forces in 1945, even after providing for the increased Admiralty demands due to the presence of theBritish Fleet in the Pacific, would not be much lower than in 1944.42. It was likely that the United States Forces in the Pacific would secure their flour supplies from North America, where there was a great wheat surplus,and thus relieve the pressure on Australian supplies.43. Supplies of sugar would be maintained in 1945 at about the same level as 1944, but because of the drought rice production would be very much lower.In quite a number of other classes of food, including edible fats (other thanbutter), supplies remained high..44. Mr. Forde added that in 1944 Australia supplied food to the UnitedStates Forces under Reciprocal Lend-Lease to the value of approximately A40 million, while the estimate for these supplies in 1945 was about A35 million, a very moderate reduction having regard to the drought.45. From the 6th to the 9th ships of the Royal Australian Navy formed part of the United States Fleet which bombarded Japanese defences in theLingayen Gulf, during which operation H.M.A.S. Australia was damaged bysuicide bombers.46.   On the 9th an Australian destroyer shelled positions near Aban.47. On the 21st H.M. Australian-manned Destroyers Napier and Normanformed part of the force which covered the landing on Ramree Island. Coastaldefences were shelled and further support was given to the assault by bombing attacks from carrier-borne aircraft.48. In preparation for their present offensive in the Philippines, UnitedStates troops handed over their positions in the Solomon Islands and BismarckArchipelago to the troops of the First Australian Army. As a result, australian troops have recently been engaged in the following operations : -49. In New Britain a detachment of 5th Australian Division which hasbeen advancing along the north coast of the Island reports having encounteredstronger opposition and having made repeated contact with Japanese patrols. Onthe south coast another force from this Division made an amphibious landing-east of Jacquinot Bay without encountering opposition, which brought it afurther 20 miles nearer to the Japanese concentrations in the Gazelle Peninsula.50. On Bougainville Island in the Solomon group troops of the3rd Australian Division, in their advance northward along the west coast fromEmpress Augusta Bay, are at present held up, but to the south in the same areastrong Japanese pockets are being mopped up in swampy country.51. In the Aitape area of New Guinea the 6th. Australian Division is engaged in &quot; a battle of track junctions,&quot; and in this area the Japanese havebeen forced to give ground in the face of aggressive patrolling, which has beenthe more difficult to carry out because the first effects of the north-west monsoonare already being experienced in this sector.52. Recent enemy casualties inflicted by Australian troops in these areas are as follows : (From 22nd November to 25th January.)     (From 3rd November to 25th January.)Service A activities.Bougainville Island.New Guinea.Killed.472P.W.16Killed.884P.W.IS
NEW ZEALAND.53. The visit of the United Kingdom Farmers&apos; delegation to New Zealandcontinues to attract attention. The leader of the delegation expressed the hopethat greater purchasing power for food after the war will provide markets, notonly for British producers, but also for producers all over the world. The Pressgenerally express the view that United Kingdom farmers must recognise thatthe policy designed to maintain the war-time agricultural structure would be neither economically nor nutritionally sound, and that the United KingdomGovernment will require to work out plans with United Kingdom farmers, andthen proceed to agreements with the Dominions and other countries. At an informal Conference held on the 11th January between members of the delegation and representatives of New Zealand&apos;s Primary Producers, the following resolu-tions were passed : (a) To hold a Conference of Primary Producers in London in October 1945.(b) That an International Federation of Primary Producers&apos; Organisationsshould be established.(c) That Primary Producers&apos; organisations of the Empire and the UnitedStates should be invited to attend the Conference.54. The formation of a New Zealand Wool Board, representing both theNew Zealand Government and the producers, has been received with approval asa step towards ensuring the post-war stability of the industry.55. Two Australian delegations visited New Zealand during January. One,led by Senator Fraser, Minister of Health, has been considering social securitylegislation in New Zealand, and the possibility of concluding a reciprocalarrangement in Australia. The other, composed of officials, is concerned withsome of the international problems which would arise after the war, including that of world trade and full employment. A conference of officials of both countries, opened in Wellington on the 23rd January. This is in accordance with-the terms of the Canberra Pact (see Report for March .1944), which provided fora fuller exchange of information between the two countries and the establishmentof a joint permanent secretariat.56. A lightning strike, called by extremists among the railway workers overthe delay by a Statutory Tribunal in deciding on an application by the Unionconcerned for a rise in basic wages, resulted in a temporary dislocation of trafficthroughout the country.Economic.57. Mr. D. G. Sullivan, Minister of Supply and Munitions, and of Industryand Commerce, whose arrival in this country was mentioned in the Report for themonth of December (W.P. (45) 74, paragraphs 44 and 45), met the President ofthe Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary of the Department of overseas Trade early in the month, and discussed with them the UnitedKingdom&apos;s export policy and the general extent to which civilian supplies were likely to become available to New Zealand in the immediate.future and after theend of the German war.58. Arrangements were made for a number of New Zealand&apos;s specificimport requirements from this country to be examined individually by officials of the Departments concerned in collaboration with New Zealand officials.59. Mr. Sullivan also had talks with the Ministers of Supply, Food and war Transport on other supply and shipping questions and with the Ministerof Reconstruction on the organisation in this country of the planning work on post-war reconstruction. Certain aspects of some of these questions have alsobeen subsequently pursued between officials.60. Mr. Sullivan, in the latter half of January, paid a visit to the NewZealand Forces in the Italian theatre of war. He is expected back in the UnitedKingdom early in February and will probably leave for New Zealand very shortly afterwards.Service Activities.61. In Italy, on the Eighth Army front, troops of the Second New Zealand division have^ been in the line during some portion of the month under reviewbut no operations of major importance have been reported.
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.62. The second session of the 9th Union Parliament was opened on the20th January by the Officer Administering the Government. The opening speechwas concerned mainly with questions arising out of the transition from war to peace, during which period it was hoped to maintain, and gradually to raise, thegeneral standard of production and of the living of the whole community. the leader of the Opposition, Dr. Malan, moved a motion of censure, expressing dis-approval of the &quot; laxity and incompetence &quot; which had been shown by the Govern-ment in connection with the provision and distribution of food, and theGovernments rejection of the recommendations of the National HealthCommission, and its general unpreparedness to face problems such as that of social security. In this connection, there seems to be fairly general dissatisfactionover the failure of the Government to deal with many home problems.63. At the Annual Conference of the South African Labour Party inJohannesburg, it was decided by an overwhelming majority to postpone discussionof the question of withdrawing from the Government until after the european war, when a special conference will be convened to consider the party&apos;s position.Mr. Madeley, the Minister of Labour, will not, therefore, be called on to relinquishhis post.64. The Kenya Legislative Council resolution recommending the immediatesummoning of a pan-African conference is widely commented on in the SouthAfrican press. On the one hand, press comment follows the line that the proposals is &quot;untimely &quot; and that there is no reason why South Africa should be expectedto take part in a dispute over native policy in which it is not immediately involved;on the other, The Sunday Times supports the proposal. Die Vaderland,while urging that a conference should be held, considers. &quot; that Africa can judgeits future development better than can be done in European capitals.&apos;&apos;65. The Minister of the Interior, Mr. Clarkson, made a brief reference tothe Governments post-war migration policy in answer to a question in the Houseof Assembly, in which he said that the Union Government did not propose to embark on any big immigration scheme at present, but that suitable immigrantswho could be absorbed without detriment to the interests of Union nationalswould be welcomed.66. Domestic interest has been directed towards the serious problem of housing, and there is a demand for the establishment of some form of Statebuilding authority, with comprehensive power to settle the responsibility of housing schemes and labour problems.67. Mr. J. H. Hofmeyr, Minister of Finance and Education, speaking at ameeting of the South African Institute of Race Relations at Cape Town,delivered an attack on what he called the &apos;&apos; Herrenvook &apos;&apos; conception, advocated by the extreme Nationalists in the Union, and characterised the prevalent anti-Semitism as &quot; smelling of Nazism.&quot;68. The Union Government have arranged for the holding of a southern africa Air Transport Conference in March. The conference was planned for lastyear, but was eventually postponed.69. The boycott by the natives of the municipal bus service operatingbetween Johannesburg and the native township of Alexandria, which has beenin existence for over two months, ended early in January. The bus company has agreed to reinstate temporarily the earlier fares on a three months&apos; trial. * the natives had complained that they could not afford the increased fares, and theUnion Government may eventually have to construct a railway to Alexandria toprovide for an even lower fare than the present one.70. General Mark Clark, Commander of the Allied Forces in Italy, in a broadcast to the Union, paid a great tribute to the aggressive valour of the&apos; Unionforces operating in Italy.  This has been much appreciated in South Africa.Economic.71. The Union, like Australia, has been suffering from a drought, and its effect on the food supply has led to a renewal of the demand for the establishmentof a Ministry of Food. So far the Government has shown no inclination todivorce food control from the Ministry of Agriculture. &apos; Recent rains in the transvaal and Orange Free State have come too late to benefit the summer crops,and a shortage of maize and other crops is certain.
72. The members of the Union Supply Mission, whose visit to this country was mentioned in W.P. (44) 730, paragraph 41, have now returned to SouthAfrica on completion- of their tour of the United States, Canada and the UnitedKingdom.73. During their visit here members of the Mission, who emphasised their desire to see trade with the United Kingdom resumed, as circumstances permitted,to the fullest extent, had a series of discussions on immediate supply problems and future supply prospects with Ministers and with officials from the Depart-ments concerned. They subsequently visited a number of manufacturing firms in various parts of the country and were thus able on the one hand to observe for themselves the continued concentration of United Kingdom industry upon war production, which has limited our ability to export even essential goods, and onthe other hand to gain some idea of the greatly increased manufacturing capacity which will become available for the production of civilian goods for export whenreconversion on a substantial scale becomes possible.74. The opportunity was taken to impress on the Mission the desirabilityof firm orders for future requirements on the United Kingdom being placed now,particularly for heavy goods such as machinery and engineering equipment, sothat advantage could be taken of any pockets of capacity when they became available.75. Detailed discussion took place on the present procedure in the union for the issue of Essentiality Certificates for imports from this country. Agree-ment was reached, subject to the approval of the Union Government, upon asimplified procedure which should facilitate the procurement and shipment ofgoods from the United Kingdom as capacity for their manufacture becomesincreasingly available.EIRE.76/ Dr. Douglas Hyde, the President of Eire, .has announced his decision not to be a candidate at the forthcoming Presidential election. (Each candidate for election as President must be nominated by at least twenty members of either house of the Oireachtas, or by not less than four county or borough councils. the voting is by Dail constituencies.)77. In reply to a request in the Dail for a statement of the functions ofthe Commonwealth Air Transport Council, its personnel and the method of theirappointment, the Minister for Finance said that he was not in a position to add to the official published statements made by the British authorities withregard to the Council. Asked whether the Eire Government had been notified of the setting up of such a Council and had been invited to take part in it, theMinister said that so far as his information went they had not been invited.78. The total value of money orders and postal orders originating in theUnited Kingdom and paid in Eire during the period from 1939 to the24th January was. 22,830,000.,79. A deficit of  4,006,439 and a sharp rise in revenue and expenditure were the main features of the Irish Exchequer return for the first nine monthsof the financial year. Total revenue amounted to  29,401,428, an increase of 1,171,642 as compared with the same period in 1943. The total expenditureamounted to  33,407,867, an increase of  1,546,937.80.   The reports and balance sheets for 1944 of the ten Irish Banks showthat deposits and credit accounts totalled  294,340,424 for the year, repre-.senting a rise of  26,054,470 on the year.81. Over 1,000,000 deposits, involving  8,352,000, were made to savings bank accounts in 1944, as compared with 839,000 deposits amounting to 6,607,000 in 1943. The surplus of deposits over withdrawals was  4,912,000as compared with  3,679,000 in 1943. A marked increase in the savings habitsince the war began is shown by comparison with 1939, when deposits were 2,918,000 and the surplus of deposits over withdrawals  827,000. Sales of savings Certificates in 1944 amounted to  1,511,000 as compared with  1,175,000in 1943 and  483,000 in 1939. The total amount to the credit of the public in post Office Savings Schemes at the end of 1944 was  41,032,000 made up of 26,357,000 in the Savings Bank, and  14,675,000 in Savings Certificates.Approximately one person, out of every six has a Savings Bank account.
82.   There were 75,755 registered unemployed persons in Eire on the6th January as compared with 75,212 a year ago.83. The value of the agricultural output of Eire in 1943-44 is reported at  91,000,000 as compared with  45,000,000 in 1938-39.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India,Political,84. January brought no decisive change in the political scene, but certain features in it call for notice. Mr. Gandhi remains in semi-retirement from public life, and it may be that his health will prevent the full resumption of his formeractivities. He is still in touch. hoAvever, with the development of his &quot; con-structive programme &quot; for Congress workers directed to welfare and educationalactivities among peasants, industrial labour and students. It is obviouslypossible to regard this campaign as a device for maintaining enthusiasm and.cohesion among Congress followers and for keeping the Congress machine in working order in preparation for a further mass movement. Indeed, the potential danger is causing the authorities some anxiety and in Bihar the provincial government had to serve internment orders confining to their home villages fiveprominent Congressmen whose speeches and other activities were not confined topurely welfare interests.85. The Sapru Conciliation Committee circulated a comprehensivequestionnaire on the issues to be considered in connexion with any political settlement. The replies should be of much interest even if the Committee shouldfail to make agreed recommendations. Two former Congress leaders, Rajago-palachari and Munshi, made suggestions to the Committee based on the federalprovisions of the Government of India Act, 1935. But these attracted lessattention in the Nationalist press than reports of an interview with the Viceroyby Bhulabhai Desai, leader of the Congress Party in the Legislative Assembly,and statements from Muslim League quarters professing detachment from this development: these have aroused speculations on the possibility of the formationof a provisional government, in which the main political parties would berepresented.Foreign and Frontier Relations.86. Afghanistan. The internal situation remained quiet. The rebelleader, Mazrak, was quiescent, but the Afghan Government were reported to becontemplating an attempt to force his surrender by bombing.87.   The Afghan Government were delighted with the reception accorded tothe Afghan Military Mission in India.   The Mission completed their tour ofMilitary Establishments and forward areas, and returned to Delhi for conversa-&apos;&apos;tions with the Indian authorities on.the 20th January.88. On the Northern Frontier the - Russians showed themselves moreaccommodating, and the Afghan Ambassador in Moscow, who was on a visit to Afghanistan, had had a promise from M. Molotov that he would settle thetroublesome question of the boundary along the Oxus.89.   North-West Frontier.-A heavy fall of snow in the middle of the month,and bitter cold restricted, all activity on the Frontier, which continued quiet.90. Tibet.-After Sir Basil Gould&apos;s departure from Tibet Mr. Shen, theChinese delegate, wrote to him asking to be informed when the Government ofIndia despatches a formal invitation to the Chinese Government to discussTibetan affairs, As Mr. Shen had previously suggested in Lhasa merely thathe might have informal conversations in India with officials of the Governmentof India, the Government of India received the impression that, having tele-graphed certain proposals to the Generalissimo, Mr. Shen was now trying tomanoeuvre them into the position of taking the initiative in staging discussions about Tibet in India behind the back of the Tibetan Government. this impression was strengthened by a conversation which Mr. Shen had withMr. Sherriff, head of the British Mission in Lhasa, in which he stated that bewould not be able to go to India for any discussion unless he received a formalinvitation from the Government of India; in that case he would, he said, beC29281] c
given authority to discuss the Tibetan question. He added that the only out-standing questions between Britain and China were Hong Kong and Tibet andhe hoped that Hong Kong would be handed back to China. Mr. Sherriff was instructed to inform Mr. Shen that there was no question of any formal conversa-tions or a formal invitation but that he would be welcomed if he wished to goto India for informal discussions.91. Nepal. The recent incognito visit to India of the King of Nepal andhis son passed off very successfully and the Maharaja has expressed to HisMajesty&apos;s Minister his great gratification at the excellent arrangements madefor His Majesty&apos;s convenience during his stay in India.92. The Persian Gulf. The Sultan of Muscat received the award of.C.I.E. in the New Year&apos;s Honours List. During the war, in return for a subsidy, the Sultan has made available to ust naval and air facilities in histerritory and has shown every co-operation.Economic.93. A good deal of consideration has been given recently to the danger thatthe strain on the general economy of India occasioned by the use of the country as a base (actual and prospective) for operations against the Japanese may have such serious effects as to prejudice operations. This risk arises particularly inregard&apos; to the demands of operations on the transportation facilities in India,the congestion on which is slowing up the whole life of the country. There isalso a general shortage of the simple wants of the people and the risk of inflationonce more developing is always present. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, as chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Indian Financial Questions, has accordingly drawn the attention of Ministers in charge of the Departments con-cerned to the view of the Committee that, notwithstanding the temporaryuncertainty as to the precise nature and phasing of future plans in the far eastern theatre, everything possible should be done to meet India&apos;s needs, havingregard to the serious strain already being imposed on India by operations on theexisting scale and by such preparations as will have to continue whatever the major decision.94. A delegation from the Government .of India headed by Sir AkbarHydari left India by air for London at the end of January in order to discussIndia&apos;s import requirements and the question of diverting orders for military requirements from Indian production so as to enable greater quantities of civiliangoods to be produced in India itself.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.Royal Indian Navy.95.   H.M.I.S. Nasik commissioned on the 24th January.96.   H.D.M.L. 1268 commissioned on the 29th January.97. H.M.I. Ships have been actively engaged in Convoy Escort dutiesthroughout the East Indies98.

Ships and Landing Craft Crews from General Sir Oliver Leese,Commander-in-Chief, India, S.A.C.S.E.A. and Commander-in-Chief, East IndiesFleet.Military.100. Mediterranean. The 8th and 10th Indian Divisions were engaged onthe Eighth Army Front.  The 4th Indian Division is still employed in Greece.101. Burma. Fourteenth Army area. Considerable progress was made butat a reduced pace and against stiffening opposition. The right flank is at Tilinon the Mytttha river some 100 miles south of Kalemyo. The sizable town ofMonywa has been taken after a week&apos;s stiff fighting and Mvinmu on the northbank of the Irrawacldy 30 miles west of Mandalay has been captured. South ofShwebo, Ondaw, some 15 miles from Mandalay, has been taken.
102. A considerable length of the Irrawaddy for 270 miles from Myitkyinasouthwards to Twingge is now under our control. Twingge is only 100 rivermiles from Mandalay. Further south bridgeheads exist at Thabeikkyin and Singuon the east bank. At the latter.point, only 48 miles from Mandalay and offeringthe moat vulnerable approach to it, the Japanese are displaying great sensitivenessand trying desperately to drive us back.103. Further east British troops have reached Mabein and Bahe at thesouthernmost bend of the Shweli river.104. Northern Combat Area Command. Chinese First Army troopsadvancing from Namkham met troops of &quot;the Chinese Expeditionary Force fromYunnan at Muse on the 21st January. They have since occupied Mongyu, thuscompleting the junction of the Ledo and Burma-China roads.105. 15 Corps Area. In Arakan, after heavy air and naval bombardment,British troops landed at the north end of Ramree Island, 100 miles south ofAkyab. They have advanced south-eastwards towards Ramree, where theJapanese garrison is concentrating, and are meeting increasing resistance.Further landings have been made on Cheduba Island and Sagu Island, south ofRamree Island and at the My ebon peninsula on the mainland south of Akyab.The Japanese still have considerable forces in South Kaladan and Akyab areas and the latter is a serious threat to their only good escape route. Further north,Japanese resistance has been stiff in the Myohaung area, about 40 miles north-east of Akyab, which was captured early in January.Air.106. Heavy air strikes have been carried out on Mandalay and Sagaing(across the Irrawaddy from Mandalay) and an intensive campaign has beencarried out against enemy airfields in Central Burma and the Bangkok-Rangoonrailway. Attempts to use the rivers for evacuation of equipment during theretreat have been countered by extensive sweeps against river craft. The amountof traffic available to the enemy has shrunk considerably.107. Invaluable air -support has been given to local operations such as the clearing of the road to Tilin just north of Gangaw, the attack on Monywa andthe amphibious operations on the Arakan coast only one of which, however, hasbeen opposed.General.108. Short leave to United Kingdom. -The first party of British personnel of the Indian Army was due to leave at the end of January. Thereafter parties will leave at 20 days&apos; interval. Owing to man-power shortage, it has been found impossible to include Signals personnel in these leave schemes at present.109. Pay. War Service Increment has been authorised for Indian army personnel and British Service officers attached to the Indian Army.110.   Medical. Health continues satisfactory.111. Works projects Amenities. About Rs. \ crore ( 375,000) of works have been sanctioned or await sanction.112. Training. A major-general who will be responsible for the trainingof British reinforcements has been appointed. A second British training brigadehas also been formed. A Women&apos;s Auxiliary Corps (India) Staff College is nowbeing formed at Quetta as part of the existing Staff College.113. Morale. Morale of British and Indian troops is high. The war situation in Burma and Far East has produced a feeling of increased confidence,though the effects of the improved European situation are not yet evident.114. Welfare. A sporting &quot; Circus&quot; including boxers, wrestlers, hockeyplayers and several first-class soccer players brought out from United kingdom is to tour India, Fourteenth Army and Ceylon, starting with an &apos;&apos; England-Scotland &quot; soccer match at New Delhi on the 17th February.115. Rations. The attitude of Indian troops to the changed scale of rations introduced for them about five months ago is satisfactory. Though theirattitude towards dehydrated meat and tinned food originally varied considerablyit appears that units&apos; efforts in educating the men have been successful. Britishrations appear to be regarded as satisfactory and few complaints have been seen in censorship.[29281] d
116. Mail.-The Government of India are co-operating in a scheme to beintroduced as from the 4th February, under which troops mail up to one ouncebetween the United Kingdom and the Indian and South-East Asia Commandswill be carried by air and aircarriage will also be available for heavier letterssubject to a surcharge. Accordingly letters up to one ounce sent by air to theUnited Kingdom by the Forces in India will be free, the equivalent of 6d. being charged for letters up to 1^ ounces and the equivalent of an additional 6d. foreach half ounce thereafter.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Occupied Burma&apos;.117.   There are no important developments to report.Liberated Burma.118. A report has been received that in the town of Myitkyina only about half-a-dozen buildings remain standing in recognisable form, and that the other centres of population in the Myitkyina district have been badly damaged. Mostof the damage is the result of battle, but the Chinese are reported to have been responsible for a not inconsiderable part; the inhabitants are said to fear anddislike them worse than they did the Japanese.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.[Note. In this report    Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,-and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners and.the British Resident, Zanzibar.]Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.Ceylon.119. In my report for November I stated that, as a result of representations from the Civil Defence and Food Commissioner of Ceylon, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke,who visited London for this purpose, a promise had been made to Ceylon to supplyher with rice at the increased rate of 18,000 tons a month for the first six monthsof 1945 and an assurance was also given that the authorities would do their best to maintain import at this increased rate during the second half of the year as well.120. Ceylon&apos;s rice requirements for the first six months of 1945 wereprogrammed as to 88,000 tons from Egypt and as to 20,000 tons from Brazil.Unfortunately, since the discussions with Sir Oliver Goonetilleke took place, the brazilian Government, owing I understand to a drought, have refused permission for all further exports of rice. None of the 20,000 tons programmed will,therefore, be forthcoming from Brazil. Release of rice from Egypt is being madeby the Egyptian Government conditional upon the supply of a correspondingquantity of wheat in exchange.121. The general rice situation is so difficult, particularly in view of theneeds of Ceylon and of the supply difficulties in Egypt and Brazil, that theMinister of Food has, I understand, recently asked the United States authoritiesif they could release a quantity of rice from resources controlled by them. Iunderstand, however, that it has not yet been possible to obtain any assurance from the United States authorities in this matter.Mauritius Financial A assistance to the Sugar Industry.122. The industry is passing through a period of exceptional difficultylargely as a result of the cyclone of May 1944, a shortage of fertilisers, shortageof labour and the turnover of the estates to food production. This has had theeffect of reducing the crop from approximately 300,000 tons to roughly200,000 tons.   To assist the industry in overcoming these difficulties, it has been
arranged to pay from United Kingdom funds a special bonus of  2 per ton onall sugar exported during 1944. The contribution payable under this arrange-ment amounts to approximately  500,000 and is additional to the increased priceof  2 per ton granted for 1945.Mauritius Compulsory Food Production Scheme.123. The Governor has recently recommended that, in view-of the poorresults of the Food Production Scheme, the compulsory growing of maize, maniocand sweet potatoes should be. abandoned so that all cane lands may revert to sugarproduction. The Ministry of Food and-the Ministry of War Transport haveagreed that arrangements for the supply of the additional imported food-stuffs(estimated at ,a maximum of 10,000 tons of flour or maize per annum)&apos; should bemade in view of the importance of sugar production at the present time. TheGovernor has accordingly been informed that the compulsory planting of the crops mentioned should be abandoned. It is intended, however, to encourage thecontinued production of vegetables and pistache as well as cereals and cerealsubstitutes.Palestine Diamond and Cutting Industry.124. A delegation from the Palestine Diamond Manufacturers&apos; Associationvisited this country to arrange for the future supply of rough diamonds to thediamond-cutting industry in Palestine to enable it to maintain its present produc-tive capacity, and to avoid unemployment.Desert Locust Outbreak in Middle East.125. A meeting of representatives of Middle East countries affected bythe present outbreak of the Desert Locust in the Middle East was held in Cairoin the first half of January. The present indications are that infestation andbreeding in Arabia is more extensive and has commenced earlier than last yearand that there is ,a definite threat to the territories to the north of Saudi Arabia.The meeting reviewed the means available to.meet this threat and adopted anumber of resolutions including one recommending canalisation of supply demandsthrough the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit, and also one stressing the desirabilityof establishing a permanent international organisation for prevention of outbreakof the Desert Locust.Defence.126. The 81st and 82nd West African Divisions have continued to make further progress in the Arakan Area during the month.127. The 11th East African Division have now been taken out of the linefor a rest, but the two Brigades which arrived more -recently from Ceylon arestill in action.Palestine Report on Individual Colonies.128. There have been no major terrorist outrages during the month butthere has been a disturbing outbreak of kidnapping which bears the stamp of jewish institutions conducting their own anti-terrorist campaign. The Policehave continued their activities against terrorist organisations and furtherarrests of suspects have been made. Fourteen more detainees were deportedduring the month bringing the total number deported to 279. These have beentransferred from Eritrea to the Sudan.129. Dr. Weizmann is still in Palestine and according to reports hisrelations with Ben Gurion are still somewhat strained. Jewish propaganda is increasingly focussed on immigration as the impending completion of the white paper, quota gives a sense of urgency.130. The lull in internal political activities among the Arab population con-tinued. External negotiations are still mainly in the hands of Musa Alami, whois traversing the Middle East including Saudi Arabia, where he saw Ibn Saud.Ceylon.131. The Ceylon Commission on Constitutional Reform began its publicsessions on the 22nd January.132. Lieutenant-General TI. E. D. R.

The Governor of .Cyprus, Sir Charles Woolley, visited the Cypriottroops in Italy and found them in good heart.U ganda.139. During the month strikes of lower paid labour occurred at severalplaces in-Uganda. They later developed into disturbances accompanied by acts of violence and intimidation after the strikers had rejected all invitations tonegotiate; the majority of the African employees of the Government and com-mercial interests at Kampala ceased work, and isolated clashes with the police and Military occurred. The total casualties were eight Africans killed, fifteenwounded, one Indian died from injuries by stoning and several Police and one british N.C.O. injured. The general situation had returned to normal beforethe end of the month and the Governor is appointing a Commission of Enquiryunder the Chief Justice.Civil Aviation.Proposed Southern African Air Conference.140. The Union Government have now suggested that the Conference whichwas to have been held in Johannesburg last Autumn to discuss questions relatingto civil aviation in Southern Africa, should be held in South Africa in the latter half of March. I hope that the Chairman of the East African Governors&apos;Conference and the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyassaland will beable to attend.Proposed Canada-West Indies Air Service.141. The Canadian Government have approached the United kingdom for permission for the operation of a Canadian Air Service between Canada andthe West Indies, via Bermuda and the Bahamas to Jamaica and Trinidad. the canadians seek permission to carry not only traffic between Canada and theWest Indies but also inter-island cabotage traffic, and seek to ensure that no other british service will operate on the same route.
