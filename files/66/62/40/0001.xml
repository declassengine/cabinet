THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 135.5th March, 1945.IWAR CABINET.POLISH GOVERNMENT&apos;S  COMMUNICATIONS WITH POLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 21st February, the War Cabinet decided that the Polish government might be allowed to continue to send messages to Poland subject to the censorshipof all such messages by the British authorities before they were despatched. Iwas asked to give the necessary directions to carry out this decision.2. The question of the censorship of the Polish Government&apos;s messages has proved a matter of some difficulty in view of the uncompromising attitude adoptedby the Polish Government towards the decisions reached by the Crimea conference in regard to Poland. It would be of assistance to me if the WarCabinet could give me a ruling on the general principles which should be observed in exercising this censorship. Such a ruling would also enable decisions to betaken more speedily on individual messages submitted by the Polish authorities for despatch. As things are at present each message has had to be dealt with onits merits ,and, in view of the important political issues which many of themraise, delays have occurred, of which the Polish Ambassador has recentlycomplained.3. A decision has been taken by the Foreign Office on the great majority ofthe messages so far submitted for despatch. I annex, however, two messagesupon which I have not so far felt able to give a ruling without guidance from theWar Cabinet, since they raise in an acute form the issues of principle involved inthis whole question.4. These two messages embody the Polish Governments reactions to andinterpretation of the Crimea decisions concerning Poland. They reflect theuncompromisingly hostile and unco-operative attitude of the Polish Governmentin this regard, and their general effect is to seek support for this attitude in poland and. to encourage opposition to the policy of the Three Great Powers.5. It is arguable that, as His Majesty&apos;s Government have allowed the PolishGovernment to communicate with their people in Poland, it would be difficult forus to dispute their right to inform their Delegate in Poland of their views. It isalso arguable that, since the attitude of the majority of the Poles in Poland isbelieved to be less uncompromising on the subject of relations with Soviet Russiathan the present Polish Government, the latter might in the long run merelydiscredit themselves by sending such messages.6. On the other hand I find it impossible to overlook the fact that, by allowing such messages to pass through our censorship, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment incur a measure of responsibility for permitting the dissemination in Polandof views contrary to the declared policy of the three major Allies. There is aserious risk that our attitude, if we passed the messages, would not be understood by our Soviet and possibly also our American Allies. They might even question the sincerity of our desire to carry out the Crimea proposals. They might argue that His Majesty&apos;s Government were assisting the Polish Government to organisesubversion in Poland and this might well provide the Lublin authorities with an12687   [29360]
excuse for intensifying their measures of repression and also for vilifying co-operative Poles such as M. Mikolajczyk, whom they are only too ready to identifyunjustly with the policies of the present Polish Government.7. In the light of the above it is for consideration whether any other course is open to us except to stop all telegrams which would have the effect of building upopposition in Poland to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as set out in theconclusions of the Crimea Conference. Having regard to the attitude of thePolish Government, such a ruling would probably mean in practice that fewmessages other than those of routine technical nature or those relating to enquiriesafter the safety of individuals and similar matters would be allowed to pass ourcensorship.   I shall be glad to learn the views of my colleagues.A. E.Foreign Office, 5th March, &apos;1945.ANNEX I.Premier Arciszewski to Government Delegate in Poland.24th February, 1945.I am sending you, for the confidential information of the Home Council ofMinisters, a summary of the note handed on the 19th February, 1945, by the PolishGovernment to the British Government.  Here are the main points : 11. The decisions were taken without the knowledge, participation or agreement of the Polish Government.2. They overlooked the existence of the legal authorities of the PolishState the President and Government, under whose orders the Polish Army isfighting.3. The agreement to cut off half of the territory of Poland is a violation ofArticle 1 of the Atlantic Charter, which was confirmed in the plan of the united nations on the 1st January, 1942, in the British-Soviet Pact of the 26th May,1942, as well as in numerous written and oral statements by the BritishGovernment.4. They violated clauses of the Polish-British Pact of 1939, in particularthose which guaranteed that the British Government will not enter into any agreement which would &quot; violate the sovereignty or the territorial status of the contracting Parties.&quot;5. The decision concerning the fate of half of the territory of Poland wastaken without obtaining the &apos;&apos; freely expressed will (wishes) of the interestedpeoples,&quot; which is contrary to Article 2 of the Atlantic Charter.- 6. Free elections in Poland can only take place after the departure fromthe country of the foreign armies, police and officials, and after the return of the4 million Poles who, owing to the fortunes of war, are outside of the country,and by enabling all the Parties and leaders who participated in the UndergroundMovement to take part in the elections.7. In the face of the above, the Polish Government is unable to recognise asvalid the Crimean decisions and it makes a solemn protest against them.8. Considering the lasting bonds of friendship and mutual trust betweenthe Polish and British peoples, the Polish Government is unable to accept (admit)the Crimean decisions as the final attitude of the British Government on thePolish question and it expresses its readiness to discuss them jointly.&quot;I shall send you in the next telegram reports from the British and AmericanPress on the results of the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on theCrimean Declaration, and then about the internal situation and proposals. Onthe basis of these telegrams, you will have the possibility of weighing up thesituation and of formulating your suggestions.
3175ANNEX II.Premier Arciszewski, Minister Berezowski and Minister Kusnierz toGovernment Delegate in Poland.24ith February, 1945.Vice-Premier Sobol,WITH reference to your telegrams, I am sending you a picture of thepolitical situation. The decisive moments for the Polish question are approach-ing. In deciding on Polish affairs, alongside external factors, the most important thing is the voice of the Polish Government together with the voice of thecountry. But before the Home Council of Ministers and the Council of national unity take up their stand, you must have all the elements in order not to decideat random.We assume that you have from previous times the arguments for ChairmanMikola,jczyk&apos;s attitude, further, the text of the Crimean Declaration and the text of the declaration of the Polish Government in answer to it, and that beyond this you do not possess any other material. We are now giving you the grounds for our attitude.The Crimean decisions on Poland are the proof of the practical developmentof the conceptions which arose at the Teheran Conference. They give almostone-half of Poland to Russia, they create a situation in which the rest of Polandmust become a vassal State to Russia and they promise vaguely the extensionof Poland to the west and north. Almost all of British and American opinion is against the establishment of our frontiers on the Neisse and the Oder. Besides,it is known that only one-third of East Prussia is to fall to Poland, the restgoing to Russia who would press as far as the Gulf of Gdynia.This is a solution on paper. For, bringing it into-life will require theaccomplishment of several conditions about which the Crimean Declaration wassilent and without which we are given to the discretion of Russia. Taking thisinto consideration, taking also into consideration Soviet procedure in otherCentral and Eastern European countries and having a picture of what is happening in Poland, we must come to the conclusion that the Crimean solutiongives Russia a starting point for mastery over Poland.For a long time we have been following the development of the process whichended in the Crimean Declaration and we have striven to oppose it. In the end,the Government crisis took place on these grounds, since Chairman Mikolajczykdid not see a possibility of efficacious counter-action and he came out for a policyof making the furthest possible concessions. The change of Government, in theend of November, came about for such reasons and only on this disparity of opinions. On the Polish side, the previous policy was arrested and diverted bythe change of Government, on the international side it was carried on along thesame lines and was expressed in the Crimean Declaration. Whether it will be turned likewise in the international field depends to a great extent on the attitudeof the Government and the opinion of the country for which we- are referring toyou. The announcement of the Crimean decisions concerning Poland created agreat stir in western thought. The world considers them unjust. But it isturning to the people in Poland itself and wants to know their opinion. Yourfive and a half years of struggle and suffering Constitute too great a sum not tobe of importance in and influence opinion and international decisions.We ask you for your views. You have to choose between two solutions :either to acquiesce in the Crimean decisions for the partition of Poland and for putting her under predominant Russian influence, mitigating, may be, for acertain time the extermination of the nation, or to express the plain will of allPoles which demands the Allies to hold fully to their pledges. The first is theeasier way the way of obtaining glib conversations with the West, compliments,praise and promises, all of which, however, will not manage to conceal the truematter. The second way is difficult it will force the country to new, great efforts, but it will make possible defence of a real independence.In order to inform you fully, we acid that a tremendous majority of theemigrants, Polish-Americans, as well as the Army, Air Force and Navy, havechosen the second way and are talking the stand which the Government expressedin its declaration sent to you and published on the day following the Conferencein Yalta.It is necessary to have information about your attitude quickly.A full explanation of the situation has been owing to you for a long time, butwe are not able to send it owing to difficulties in communication, independently
of us, and recently owing to the temporary interruption of our communications with Poland ordered by the British Government.Therefore, we are treating your recent communications to us as opinionstaken without being in possession of the necessary information. We are nowsending you more complete information in a series of messages, and we expect that, after consideration of them, you will send us, as quickly as possible, youropinions, which will have been thoroughly discussed in the Home Council ofMinisters and the Council of National Unity.We are approaching the British authorities with the request for the right of free communication with you, in the name of the rudimental principles of democracy. In the name of these principles we are also making a request for your journey to London, since, after acquainting ourselves in full on the situation,we would be able to make, jointly, further decisions.
