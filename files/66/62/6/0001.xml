THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 101.l$th February, 1945.WAR CABINET.COMMITTEE   ON   THE  TREATMENT   OF   CHILDREN  deprived of  A NORMAL HOME  LIFEMemorandum by the Home Secretary.IN connection with the appointment of a Committee on this subject by theMinister of Health, the Minister of Education and myself, a question has arisen which I feel I ought to bring to the notice of the War Cabinet.After consultation between the three of us we have decided to constitute the Committee as shown in the attached list (Annex).Careful attention was given to the selection of a Chairman. We all feltthat for a Committee of this character it would be right, if possible, to find asuitable woman as Chairman. The selection of a suitable woman was, however,not easy. It is essential that the Chairman should bring to the Committee notonly interest and a sound judgment, but should be capable of guiding the deliberations of the Committee and producing a report which will lead topractical measures. We were all agreed that Miss Myra Curtis (formerlyDirector of Women Establishments at the Treasury and now Principal ofNewnham College, Cambridge) has the ability and experience which wouldenable her to do this work well, and I have no doubt that under her guidance theCommittee will make a comprehensive review of the subject and present a report which will enable useful and practical measures to be taken. With theconcurrence of the Minister of Health and the Minister of Education, Miss Curtiswas invited to accept the Chairmanship and she has accepted.Miss Curtis was, however, one of the two people the other being theChairman, jMr. Vick, K.C. who have recently presented the report on theLondon Remand Home question. This report is being made the subject of con-controversy, and the allegation is being made that it is a white-washing reportinstigated by the Home Office. There is not the slightest foundation for thisallegation : the enquiry was thorough and impartial, and but for the spirit of controversy which has surrounded this incident from the outset, the conclusions in the report would be generally accepted as sensible and right.The question is whether, because of the controversy directed against thisreport on the London Remand Home, it is right to appoint Miss Curtis as Chair-man of the Committee. It may well be that the appointment will be criticised in certain quarters.I myself would be quite willing to stand up to such criticism and, were therean opportunity of debating the matter fully, to defend the appointment of miss Curtis. But I ought to know whether this line would be supported generallyby my colleagues, and for this reason I am bringing the matter to the notice of theWar Cabinet.&apos; H.
