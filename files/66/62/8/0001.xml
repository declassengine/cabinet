S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,18th February, 1945.(I)Copy of Letter from President Roosevelt to the Prime Minister, dated10th February, 1945.Dear Winston,As I said the other day, I am somewhat concerned over the political difficulties I am apt to encounter in the United States in connection with the ratification by the Senate of the Dumbarton Oaks Agreement because of the factthat the United States alone among the three Great Powers will have only asingle vote in the Assembly. I understand from our conversation that you wouldhave no objection if I found it necessary to work out some way of giving theUnited States additional votes in order to insure parity. I am writing you this letter since I know you understand so well our political situation in the UnitedStates and I hope in reply to this letter you can give me your agreement to this[29246]
suggestion if I find it necessary for our public opinion to make some proposalalong those lines at the forthcoming United Nations Conference.I am enclosing a copy of the letter which I have written to Marshal Stalinon the same subject.Most sincerely vours,(Signed) FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.The Right HonourableWinston S. Churchill, C.H., M.P.,Vorontsov Villa, Crimea.(II)Copy of a Letter from President Roosevelt to Marshal Stalin, dated10th February, 1945.My dear Marshal Stalin,I have been thinking, as I must, of possible political difficulties which I might encounter in the United States with the number of voteswhich the Big Powers will enjoy in the Assembly of the World Organisation.We have agreed, and I shall certainly carry out that agreement, to support at theforthcoming United Nations Conference the admission of the Ukrainian and white Russian Republics as members of the Assembly of the World Organisation.I am somewhat concerned lest it be pointed out that the United States will have only one vote in the Assembly. It may be necessary for me, therefore, if I am to insure whole-hearted acceptance by the Congress and people of the United Statesof our participation in the World Organisation, to ask for additional votes in theAssembly in order to give parity to the United States.I would like to know, before I face this problem, that you would perceive noobjection and would support a proposal along this line if it is necessary for meto make it at the forthcoming conference. I would greatly appreciate your lettingme have your views in reply to this letter.Most sincerely yours,(Signed) FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.Marshal I. V. Stalin,Koreis, The Crimea.(Ill)Copy of a Letter from the Prime Minister to President Roosevelt, dated11th February, 1945.I have given consideration to your letter of the 10th February about thepolitical difficulties which might arise in the United States in connection withthe ratification by the Senate of the Dumbarton Oaks Agreement because of the
fact that the United States alone among the three Great Powers will have onlyone vote in the Assembly.Our position is that we maintain the long-established representation of theBritish Empire and Commonwealth; that the Soviet Government are represented by its chief member, and the two republics of the Ukraine and White Russia;and that the United States should propose the form in which their undisputedeauality with every other Member State should be expressed.( ) I need hardly assure you that I should do everything possible to assist you in this matter.(Signed) WINSTON&quot; S. CHURCHILL.The President of the United Statesof America.
