Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.use oft is issued&quot;F secret.P. (45) 192.24-th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.REDEPLOYMENT   AFTER   DEFEAT   OF GERMANY.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT the request of the Prime Minister I presided over a Committee, consistingof the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the Secretary of State for theColonies, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for War, theSecretary of State for Air, the Minister of War Transport, the Minister ofState and the Chiefs of Staff, to examine the proposals in W.P. (45) 125 forthe use of personnel shipping in the first six months after the defeat of Germany.2. The Committee recommended to the Prime Minister the adoption ofthe categories and the priorities set out in the Appendix to this paper. TheCommittee are advised that the adoption of this scheme will enable moves duringthe six months in Category A to be completed 100 per cent., moves in Category Bto be completed up to 66 per cent., and moves in Category C up to 25 per cent.Moves in Category D will be fitted in as far as possible. There must be room for some elasticity in the application of these priorities.3. The Committee also recommended the grant to the Americans of a trans-Atlantic lift of 40,000 a month for the six months following the defeat ofGermany, and that the two &apos;&apos; Queens &apos;&apos; and the A quitania should be used for thispurpose. We do not consider that this arrangement should, be made subject to conditions enabling us to scrutinise the types of United States troops to becarried in our ships. We recommended, however, that in negotiation an attempt should be made to get some compensating lift from the Americans on other routes,on the basis of the most economical over-all use of our combined shipping resources, on lines to be agreed between the Minister of War Transport and theWar Office.4. The Prime Minister has approved these recommendations as a generalguide in the further consideration of this question, and for the use of the staffsconcerned with the examination of the problem of redeployment in Washington.C.

His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed to a schemefor granting leave (L.I.A.P.) for those who are serving overseas. Theyare also committed to a leave scheme for giving leave to british members of the Indian Army who have served for 3 years, 8 months in the Far East. The Secretary of State for the Colonies also regardsit as essential that the East and West African Forces should beincluded in the general leave scheme for those who are servingoverseas.(c) Moves for approved operations for the Pacific, i.e., British Pacific Fleet,the V.L.R. Bomber Force and Dominion air forces, for early participa-tion in the war against Japan.(d) Return of British C commonwealth prisoners of war.Category B.

It was agreed at&quot;Argonaut&quot; that forces should be reoriented from the Europeantheatre to the Pacific and Far East as a matter of highest priority,having regard to other agreed and/or inescapable commitments, assoon as the German situation allows.In addition, the New Zealand Government have emphasised theiranxiety that arrangements should be made for New Zealand Forcesin the Mediterranean theatre to be repatriated as early as possible after the defeat of Germany, or earlier if this is decided upon.(c) Normal internal movements tuithin the Mediterranean, including the build-up of the Imperial Strategic Reserve.(d) Dispersal of abnormal or excessive staffs and personnel from Egypt andthe Middle East.Category C. Moves for which a &quot; token &quot; lift must be provided.(a) Canadian forces other than those included in Category B above. TheCanadian Government have pressed that on the cessation of hostilities with Germany Canadian forces should be repatriated from theEuropean theatre as quickly as circumstances will permit, in propor-tion to the number of United States forces returned to the UnitedStates.(b) South African Defence Force. The Union Government are anxious thatthe South African forces should be repatriated as early as possible,and the settled policy is that every effort should be made to meet thiswish consistently with operational requirements.(c) Colonial forces.
