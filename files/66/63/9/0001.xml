THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET. /-   ; ; VRELIEF FOR FORTH-WEST HOLLAND.Letter from Dr. Gerbrandy to the Prime Minister.(G.U. 60/45/X.)Arlington House,Arlington Street,London, S. W. 1,My dear Prime Minister, 7th March, 1945.MY visit to General Bedell Smith in Versailles, concerning which I spoke to you in the course of a conversation on Saturday, the 20th January, 1945, inyour map room, took place on Saturday, the 24th February.In view of the importance of the matter, I should like to give you an accountof the outcome, though I expect you are already acquainted with it.On grounds which are already familiar to you through the Note (telegram)of Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands to His Majesty the King yourSovereign and to you, and through information given to you by myself, to whichI added certain additional material of more recent date, I stated that we thoughtit necessary to ask for a special military operation aimed at the liberation of holland, the north-western part of which, with its population of nearly fivemillions, is in dire straits. I asked whether General Bedell Smith would be ableto give me an immediate answer to this very natural request, put forward indead earnest, and backed by documented information. He said that he was prepared, in confidence, to give me a frank reply: We can&apos;t do it. We havenot got the necessary divisions and war material at our disposal.&quot; GeneralBedell Smith gave me further information, together with a confidential accountof forthcoming operations. He asked me : &quot; Could your people bold out tothe second half of May? &quot; and that question convinced me that I should notindulge in any optimism with regard to the early liberation of North Holland.There is no need for me to emphasise to you that this situation fills me withthe deepest concern, and this concern has been increased by &quot;circumstances, about which I feel I must enlighten you, even though by a somewhat unconventionalmethod.The situation in North-West Holland is desperate. In Rotterdam, accord-ing to the report of a trustworthy official who escaped through the lines, it mayhappen that when you ring the door-bell of a house you get no answer. Oninquiry you may find that every single member of the family is dead. Cases ofdeaths by the roadside or in the rest shelters provided in schools, and other places,are common. Even in the most favourable circumstances there are people whotry to still the pangs of hunger with flower bulbs. The prices offered for onesingle potato, one piece of bread, and so on, off the ration, are fantastic.According to one partly confirmed report from occupied Holland, already inJanuary there was difficulty in burying the bodies in one town owing to theinordinate demand for coffins. When this happened, bodies were buried in massgraves.In the midst of all this misery there are indications of amazing courage andspirit. Even now most pepple still refuse to go to those special German communalkitchens, from which issue the tempting fragrance of hot meals to lure them intothe arms of the enemy (they are given a hot meal if they give themselves up forwork under the Germans). But the plain, hard truth is that in the north-westpart of the country the people of the Netherlands are dying. The large or small percentage of survivors which then remain will be completely exhausted. We can expect to find nothing but physical, and perhaps also mental, wrecks.When General Bedell Smith asked me whether the people could hold out untilthe middle of May, I had to answer &quot; No.&quot; The future of our nation is in thebalance.The alarming state of affairs in North-West Holland makes the necessity of help immediately after the liberation all the more urgent. Responsibility for &quot;thisrests with the Supreme Allied Commander of S.H.A.E.F. At the beginning ofJanuary of. this year General Eisenhower, my colleague Mr. De Booy and myselfhad a conversation on this subject, when we received promises from which we-   [29387]
derived much comfort. One day after I myself had a talk with General BedellSmith, during which we discussed the method whereby the plans for reliefimmediately after liberation could be carried out. On the basis of these conversa-tions I had much satisfaction in confirming the following points : -1. The plans for relief and the carrying out of these plans for the period immediately after the liberation of Holland are the responsibility ofthe 21st Army Group and under the sole leadership of GeneralGalloway.2. Relief will be brought to the starving population by three routes:(a) transport by road from Oss, where 30,000 tons of food supplieshave been collected for this purpose; (&amp;) transport by water fromWest Brabant or some other place or ships to which supplies may bebrought; (c) transport of supplies by sea from England. These threeroutes will be utilised from the first day possible and at one and thesame time for the relief of the people.3. Whatever it is possible to do for the relief of the starving population bymeans of aircraft shall be done, though this might be more in thenature of token help than of substantial assistance.These promises certainly gave us much satisfaction. Nevertheless theproblems which arise in connection with relief operations would not yet have been entirely solved. It is possible, for example, that the Germans will not all retire from Holland, but will remain in pockets on the west coast, so that relief workwill have to take place in the midst of full military operations. This question also was discussed and a solution sought.Since these proposals had to a certain extent set the minds of the NetherlandGovernment at rest, it was all the more disappointing to learn that GeneralGalloway had been appointed commander of a division instead of being placed atthe head of the relief operations, and that the supplies already available at Oss(in Brabant) for relief of Western Holland after liberation had been so reducedthat, out of 30,000 tons only about 5,000 remained, while there was no question of collecting supplies anywhere else. Nothing further had been done about thetransport problem.In my conversation with General Bedell Smith (and with the head of civil affairs) on the 24th February, 1945, I made plain my great concern about the waymatters were going. I again received assurances from him. I have every faith in General Bedell Smith&apos;s understanding of the position and in his devotion and ability to solve the problem. He has the greatest goodwill towards our people.He has taken up the matter himself with Field-Marshal Montgomery&apos;s Chiefof Staff, General Guingand, and I hope for great improvement in the position.There is already some initial improvement: General. Galloway is at present working as Chief of the relief plan. We have an excellent liaison in GeneralClark, head of the S.H.A.E.F. mission to the Netherland Government.I cannot conceal the fact, however, that the trust of the Netherland Govern -ment has been shaken by the course events have taken. The fact that, in spiteof the promise given to us, there has been neglect on the part of the 21st ArmyGroup, and that an intervention by General Bedell Smith has been necessary, is most disquieting. It is a question of the relief of a population of 4 to 5 millions,all living on the brink of death, people who will have literally nothing when theGermans retreat. Every day which finds them still without food, after the departure of the Germans, means more deaths. For the Dutch nation it will be,if it is not already too late, a question of to be or not to be. Relief operations which will really provide help at once necessitate technical preparation andequipment on a considerable scale. In particular, the allocation of the necessarytransport is essential. Supplies will have to be brought up in large quantities andas near the northern territories as possible. If these things are not done, therewill be no efficient distribution, and much time will be lost.We have handed over to the Allies everything we had; our ships, our men, ournavy, even our supplies, are no longer at our disposal and we are obliged to takea passive role and wait until S.H.A.E.F. acts. Nevertheless, while millions arestarving, the question will sooner or later be asked : has the Netherland Govern -ment done everything that it could to help. If it appears that more could havebeen done and that a large number of loyal Dutchmen, who held firm to the last moment, met their deaths because we were insufficiently prepared or our plans tooclumsy for rapid operation, such a revelation will come not only as a shock to public opinion, but as a scandal, the responsibility for which will be laid at the door not only of the Dutch Government, but also, I fear, &apos; of the BritishGovernment.
Every day that elapses between the departure of the Germans and the dis-tribution of food to the people is going to mean life or death to hundreds of thousands. As things are at present, if we were suddenly to be faced with aHolland from which the Germans had departed, it would, I am afraid, be clearthat the immediate operation of an efficient relief plan is not possible. The result would be disaster.I may not forbear from making this plain to you.Yours very sincerely *(Signed) &quot;   P. S. GERBRANDY.The Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill, C.H., M.P.,10 Downing Street, Whitehall, S.W. 1.
