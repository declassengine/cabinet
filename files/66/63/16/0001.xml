The purpose of this paper is to state the objectives of theGovernment&apos;s housing policy, the organisation for achieving them and theprogress so far made.2. In the years 1934-39, the total output of houses exceeded 300,000a year. In 1939 the number of houses was approximately equal to thenumber of separate families, and a campaign for slum clearance and the abatement of gross overcrowding was in full swing. There was still muchto do, but deficiencies in quantity and quality were being made good.3. This progress was cut short by the war. The number of houses builtbetween 1939 and 1945 has not exceeded 150,000. Some 200,000 houseshave been entirely destroyed by enemy action, and 250,000 so badly damaged that they are uninhabitable. A further 4,000,000 houses have been damaged but are still occupied in varying degrees of repair. Currentrepair the first line of defence in the maintenance of health and comfortin housing has perforce been neglected and the conditions of large numbersof houses have therefore progressively deteriorated.OBJECTIVES.4. The Governments first objective is to afford a separate dwelling forevery family which desires to have one. For this purpose it is estimatedthat some three-quarters of a million dwellings are required.5. The second objective is to provide for the rapid completion of theslum clearance and overcrowding programmes which were already in courseof execution before the war. To remove houses already condemned as unfitand to abate overcrowding condemned since 1935, a further half-millionhouses are required.6. The long-term objective of the Government is to secure a progressiveimprovement in the conditions of housing in respect both of standards of accommodation and of equipment, and to attain this objective by a continuous programme of new building. This continuous programme must include provision year by year for any increase in the number of separatefamilies, the needs which arise out of redistribution of the population, andthe replacement of obsolescent houses.ORGANISATION.7. The construction of houses requires the co-operation of many agencies builders, the industries making materials and fitments, local housing authorities and the Central Government.Local Housing Authorities.8. The local housing authorities are responsible for determining, with theapproval of the Government, the number and type of houses they will building their areas. They prepare the sites, erect permanent houses or arrangefor their erection under contract, select tenants, fix rents and undertake themanagement of their housing estates.In many cases, the same authority is also responsible for public health,town and country planning, sewerage and roads.9. In Scotland, besides the local housing authorities, the Scottish special housing Association, a non-profit-making body financed from Treasury funds,operates in areas in which the housing needs are greatest and pays special attention to non-traditional forms of construction.
Central Government.10. No form of Government organisation can entirely separate housingrequirements and deal with them in isolation.Many industries are involved in making the materials and fitmentsrequired for house construction and in times of scarcity many other users arein competition for these materials. Moreover, the building industry mustcarry out many other tasks besides house construction. The planning and execution of the housing programme, therefore, requires the combined operation of many different agencies and the speedy settlement of competing claims on limited resources of manpower and industrial capacity.11. The main responsibility for the Governments functions in relationto housing is shared between four Departments the Ministry of Health,the Department of Health for Scotland, the Ministry of Works and theMinistry of Town and Country Planning.12. The Health Departments (the Ministry of Health for England andWales and the Department of Health for Scotland) are responsible for housing policy as part of their wider responsibility for public health. Inparticular:   ., i(a) they formulate a housing programme for the country as a whole&apos; and allocate the total between local authorities throughout thecountry;(b) they determine the standards of accommodation to be provided in new houses and the standards of fitness and density of occupationwhich can continue to be accepted in existing houses;(c) they supervise the housing functions of local authorities, both in thebuilding of new houses, and in the action to be taken to dealwith unsatisfactory housing conditions;(d) they sanction the building proposals of local authorities, includingthe acquisition of sites, the lay-out and plans of permanent houses and contracts for building them;(e) they ascertain the requirements of local authorities for temporarynouses, allocate the temporary houses to be produced under theGovernment   programme,   and   supervise   the   acquisition   and preperation of the sites required;(/) they are responsible for formulating proposals as to assistance from public funds for public and private housing.13. The Ministry of Works is the Government Department responsiblefor questions affecting the building industry (such as the registration ofbuilders, training of apprentices, allocation of labour and licensing ofbuilding work), and for undertaking building work carried on by theGovernment on its own account.Their functions in relation to housing include the following (a) as the Department responsible for the building industry, the Ministryof Works are responsible for ensuring that the materials, fitmentsand components required for the total programme of housebuilding, both permanent and temporary, will be forthcoming atthe right time and at reasonable prices. Effective working arrange-ments have been established for this purpose with the otherDepartments (Ministry of Supply, Ministry of Aircraft Production,Board of Trade) within whose general responsibility lie thearrangements for the manufacture of certain fitments.(b) as the Governments advisers on technical building questions, theMinistry of Works advise the Health Departments on housedesign, building technique and all technical questions of materials,specification and building costs. They are responsible for estab-lishing standards of quality in the design of houses and in their internal and external fitments, by means of research, experimentalbuilding and standardisation(c) as the  Governments building  department,  they  a!re  responsiblefor the production, distribution and erection of the factory-madetemporary house which is being produced at the cost of theExchequer;(d) they advise the Ministry of Labour on the labour requirements for housing and for the rest of the building programme.14. The Ministry of Town and Country Planning are consulted aboutthe choice of housing sites, the lay-out of housing estates and all general questions affecting the use of land and the planned distribution ofcommunities. At the regional level, arrangements have been made for thellegional Planning Officer to co-ordinate the views of other Departments onsites proposed by local authorities to the Ministry of Health, thus providing a single channel for the approval of sites.In Scotland, the Department of Health are responsible for town and country planning as well as for housing.15. Among other interested Departments the Ministry of Labour and national Service regulate the supply of labour in the building industryand its ancillary trades. Building labour is allocated by them in accordancewith priorities indicated by the Ministry of Works.
- 16. The Minister of Reconstruction has a general responsibility for ensuring that all parts of housing policy are integrated with one another andwith related parts of the reconstruction programme. To facilitate his taskthere are regular and frequent meetings, under his chairmanship, of theMinisters concerned. There are also standing arrangements for settlingquestions, as they arise, that concern more than one Department.PROGRAMME.17. The Government propose to treat the first two years after the endof hostilities in Europe as an emergency period when exceptional measures will be taken to meet the housing shortage. Wherever possible, these measures will be put into effect before the end of hostilities in Europe. the primary aim of the Government is to produce the largest practicable numberof separate dwellings in this emergency period.18. The Government programme may be summarised under the following heads:  Increase in Building Labour Force.19. Before the war there were about 1,000,000 men in the buildingtrades.   To-day the number is 370,000.By normal and special releases from the Forces (see Cmd. 6548) and bythe scheme for the training of apprentices and a special scheme of adult training (see Cmd. 6428) it is hoped to increase the labour force in thebuilding industry to 800,000 by the end of the first year after the german war and, thereafter, to increase it up to and beyond the pre-war total.20. Although house building will have the highest priority among civil work, the total building force will have many other claims upon it. Therewill be building for certain war purposes (until the defeat of Japan), building- for the export trade and essential civil requirements, the rebuilding ofbombed premises and essential repairs and maintenance^Maximum Use of House Building Resources.21.   Every effort will be made to use the available resources to the best- advantage by new methods of construction which economise in labour, bystandardisation and by the use of labour and industrial capacity normallyoutside the building industry.Repair of War-Damaged Houses.22. The first-aid repair of war damage has always received the highest priority and available building labour has been concentrated on the comple-tion of war damage repair.A special survey is being made by the War Damage Commission of theseriously damaged, unoccupiable houses in the country, with a view toframing a comprehensive programme of repair.The replacement of totally destroyed houses which attract a cost of workspayment will be included in the building programme of permanent housesreferred to in paragraphs 23 and 24- below.Target of 300,000 Permanent Houses in Two Years.23. Only completed houses are of immediate service in relieving thehousing shortages. Experience after the last war showed that a programmebeyond the capacity of the building industry would result in the starting ofmany houses and the completion of very few. Moreover, there would be a powerful pressure on prices if, in the early stages, more work were offeredthan the building industry could perform.24. Bearing in mind these factors and the size of the available labour force, the Government have already announced that the maximum targetwhich they can properly adopt is one of 100,000 permanent houses built or -building by the end of the first year after the end of hostilities in Europe,and a further 200,000 houses built or building by the end of the second year.Of this total of 300,000 there would be 220,000 completed houses at the endof the second year, and 80,000 in course, of erection. If more houses can be built they will be built, but the programme will be based on evidence of thebuilding resources likely to be available from time to time.Target of 200,000 Temporary or (Jtlier Houses in Two Years.25. In addition to the programme of permanent houses, the government propose to secure a further 200,000 houses, of which a proportion will betemporary houses and a proportion will be permanent houses of non-traditionaltypes.26. Temporary Houses. The Government have been authorised by theHousing (Temporary Accommodation) Act, 1944, to spend up to  150,000,000on the provision of temporary houses.27. Temporary houses arc costly because of their short lives and they aresub-standard in terms of accommodation, though not in equipment.   Being of
a single-storey type, they are also wasteful of land. These consideration have,however, been outweighed by the opportunity which they afford of bridgingsome of the gap between the practicable programme of permanent houseconstruction in the first two years after the end of the German war and thehousing needs of the country.28. The early experimental work on temporary houses was carried outre,in terms of a pressed steel house, on the assumption that pressed steelcapacity would become available for this work by the end of 1944.29. In the event, changes in the munitions programme postponed thedate when this capacity would become available, but, in view of the seriouscharacter of the housing shortage, the Government decided in September1944 that a start should be made forthwith with the manufacture of tem-porary houses. Attention was, therefore, concentrated on other types of temporary house using wood, concrete and asbestos cement for their outerfabric; and production is proceeding with a number of these types.Approval has also been given to a temporary house based on the useof aluminium which it is hoped can be brought into production towards theend of the year.30. The U.S. Government have generously declared their readiness to send some 30,000 temporary houses on lend-lease terms for erectionSin areas of war damage. Delivery of the bulk of these houses is expected in the latter half of 1945.31. The Government intend to press forward during the current year with the manufacture of temporary houses to the fullest possible extent,and the rate of production will be limited only by the supply of labour,materials and capacity.32. The length of time for which production will be continued there-after will depend on the success which is attained in the production ofpermanent houses of traditional forms of construction and of permanent houses which make less demand on building labour and involve the use ofprefabrication. In taking decisions on these matters, the primary objective of the Government will be the provision of the maximum number of houses,permanent or temporary, in the shortest practicable time.33. In the event the production of temporary houses will continuelong enough to meet the allocations which have been made to localauthorities by the Health Departments, namely 145,000.34. Permanent prefabricated houses. The Ministry of Works, inconsultation with the Health Departments, are pressing on with experimentsto ascertain the extent to which the technique of prefabrieation, which isbeing developed in the production of temporary houses, can be used for building permanent houses.35. The Ministry of Works are inviting the co-operation of a number of firms and local authorities in the erection of experimental houses, employingprefabrication or making a substantially smaller call on building labour thanhouses of traditional forms of construction. Each of these systems of con-struction has been approved by the Burt Committee and has passed aseai&apos;ching test from the technical point of view.36.   If these experiments are successful it should be possible early in&quot;the course of 1946 to start mass production of permanent houses of this type n lieu of temporary houses, and so increase substantially the number ofpermanent houses built in the first and second years after the end ofhostilities in Europe.Temporary Division of Houses.37. In order to increase the number of separate dwellings in theemergency period, local housing authorities will be encouraged to dividepermanent houses constructed during the period into two temporarily separatedwellings and to undertake the conversion of large houses and hostels intoflats.Production of Materials and Fitments.38. The Ministry of Works, in consultation with the other Departmentsconcerned, have devised the necessary machinery to ensure that the produc-tion of the various materials and fitments required for the housing programme,both permanent and temporary, is so timed that progress will not be delayed by shortage of any essential parts.39. Action under this head is being facilitated by arrangements for thestandardisation, so far as possible, of materials and fitments. Thus, theproduction of baths will be concentrated on three types, compared with 40before the war; production of storage cisterns on 28, instead of 120.40. As the war situation permits, manufacturers will be enabled to putthese standard articles into production without waiting for specific orders from builders. They will be assured, if necessary by the Government, of a market for their products.
QPrice Control.41. There was a serious rise in building costs after the last war becausedemands went far beyond the real capacity of the building industry.This time the Government will control the volume of contracts let bylocal authorities, the building and repair work done on private account andthe price of materials, standard components and fitments. By these methods/and with the co-operation of employers and employed, they intend to reducebuilding costs as quickly as possible to the level at which houses can bemade available for sale or rent at reasonable prices.Finance.42. The Government recognise that subsidies will at first be needed,while building costs are abnormally high in consequence of the war; andthey propose to provide them for house building both by local authoritiesand by private enterprise.43. Discussions are proceeding with the representatives of localauthorities about the amount of the subsidy to be paid to local housing authorities. Legislation will be introduced as soon as reliable information is available about the probable level of building costs in the emergencyperiod.Provision will be included in the subsidy legislation for the payment ofthe subsidy in respect of houses begun before the legislation is passed. Thishas been done before in similar circumstances44. The Minister of Health has already indicated that the government proposes to give a subsidy in respect of privately constructed houses ofsubstantially the same size as those to be built by local authorities. In orderto ensure that such building is started as scon as possible, this legislation will be introduced when preliminary consultations have been completed withrepresentatives of the builders and of the local authorities through whomthe arrangements will be administered.45. In accordance with arrangements described in the Housing(Temporary Accommodation) Act, 1944, the production, transport and erection of temporary houses will be undertaken by the Government; but the houseswill be erected on sites acquired and prepared by the local authorities, andwhen erected the houses will be let and managed by the local authorities inthe same way as permanent houses provided by them.PRELIMINARY WORK.Re-pair of War Damage.46.   Over  1,500,000 of the  houses damaged before the flying-bomb attacks required more extensive repair than first-aid repair, and by themiddle of June 1944 these repairs had been completed in all but 200.000houses, many of the remainder not being worth repair.47. The attack from the flying-bomb has created a special problem inLondon, and efforts have been concentrated on repairing the maximum number of houses during the winter up to the minimum tolerable standard.The &quot; winter target &quot; of repair to 720,000 houses will, it is hoped, be reached by the end of March. The next problem is to catch up with more recentdamage and to improve the general standard of repair.New Construction.48. Within the limits imposed by the exigencies of the war the Govern-ment have also endeavoured to take all practical steps to complete the preparations which have to be made in advance of actual house construction.Thus:-49. Design of Permanent Houses. The Ministry of Health and theMinistry of Works issued to local authorities in September, 1944, a HousingManual on the design and construction of houses and of their installations and equipment. This followed an exhaustive enquiry which had been carriedout by a special committee of the Central Advisory Housing Committee.The corresponding advice for Scotland is contained in a report by theScottish Advisory Housing Committee entitled &quot; Planning Our NewHomes &quot; which was published in July 1944.50. The experiments made by the Ministry of Works testing theefficiency of various methods of house construction are described in a hand-book entitled &quot; Demonstration Houses &quot; which was published by theMinistry of Works in December 1944.51. Rural Housing. A sub-Committee of the Central Housing AdvisoryCommittee produced a report on Rural Housing which was circulated tolocal authorities in England and Wales in May 1944. A report on rural housing in Scotland was submitted by the Scottish Housing Advisory Com-mittee in 1937 and preliminary action on this report had been taken before the outbreak of war.
A small programme of rural house building has been undertaken inEngland, and also in Scotland where it is part of a wider programme bomeet urgent general housing needs. The reconditioning of rural houses hasalso been proceeded with.52. Production of Temporary Houses. Designs have been approved and production has begun on five types.53. Allocation of Temporary Houses. In August, 1944, localauthorities were invited to make application for allocations of temporary houses. The initial allocations made in November 1944 amount to 86,520in England and Wales and 33,195 in Scotland. Further allocations have since been made and the total now amounts to 110,977 in England andWales and 34,375 in Scotland.54. Acquisition of Sites. The land now held by local authorities inEngland and Wales for permanent houses is 24,500 acres, sufficient on a conservative basis for 240,000 dwellings. A further 32,000 acres are in process of acquisition. In Scotland, the Department of Health have approved sites for about 100,000 permanent houses.Sites for about 55,000 temporary houses have been approved in Englandand 28,000 acquired. The corresponding figures in Scotland are 15,000 and,000 respectively.55. Advance Preparation of Sites. The preparation of sites for permanent houses by the construction of roads and sewers is proceeding.Accepted tenders cover sites sufficient for 45,000 houses in England andWales and progress is being made in the present more favourable weather conditions now available. In Scotland there are fully-developed sites capableof taking about 9,000 houses and in addition it is hoped to have sites capableof taking 23,000 houses by the end of 1945.As regards sites for temporary houses, 4,700 in England and Wales and1,400 in Scotland have been handed over to the Ministry of Works ready for the construction of the necessary concrete foundations. With the use ofthe expedited machinery for the acquisition of sites provided by the Housing(Temporary Accommodation) Act, 1944, the execution of the programmeneed not be held up by lack of sites or delay in acquiring them. But thenecessity to construct roads and sewers on a large proportion of the siteswill make substantial calls on labour during the coming months and vigorousaction will be taken in order to secure that this work of preparation keepssufficiently in advance of the production of houses to avoid a hold-up in theprogramme.56. Layouts. Detailed lay-out plans have been prepared for approximatly 90,000 houses in England and Wales and lay-outs covering78,000 houses have been approved by the Ministry of Health.In Scotland layouts have been submitted for 28,000 permanent and temporary houses, of which 23,800 have been approved.57. Standardisation. The British Standards Institution issued inDecember, 1944, a Handbook of British Standards designed to reduce thenumber of standard specifications for materials and fitments required in housing and providing new standard specifications where none existedpreviously. The Health Ministers have told local authorities that they willbe expected to use such standard articles in their housing schemes.Uth March. 1945.
