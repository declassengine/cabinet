THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP MIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.Copy No. &amp; *JW.P. (45) 160.l6*A March, 1945.WAR CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR four weeks ENDING 25th FEBRUARY, 1945.A. -A detailed summary of operations is appended.B. Results of Operations.1. Oil Targets.Successful attacks were made on a number of oil plants during the period.Photographs show that in an attack on the oil refinery at Rositz on the14th/ 15th February a cooling tower and oil storage tanks in the south-east partof the plant were severely damaged and the stores yard destroyed. As itappeared from photographic cover at the beginning of February that the synthetic oil plant at Wanne-Eickel was about to restart production up to 50 per cent, of capacity, it was attacked three times during the period. Photographs taken theday after the attack on the Monheim oil refinery showed a large group of oil tanksstill burning and on later photographs it could be seen that of some fifteen largeoil tanks only four remained. In addition the boiler house and processing unitswere damaged.The Reisholz oil refinery was severely damaged on the 20th/21st February,and the plant will be out of action until the boiler house, which was destroyed inthis attack, is repaired, which should take one or two months. Photographs takenshortly after the attacks on the benzol plants at Osterfeld and Scholven showedmany fires still burning in both plants, but the exact extent of the damage cannotbe assessed until further photographs are obtained.It is estimated that, as a result &quot;of the heavy damage caused in the attacks onthe Ffansa (Dortmund) benzol plant, production will have stopped for at least a month. The Nordstern and Alma Pluto (both at Gelsenkirchen), Prosper(Bottrop) benzol plants and the synthetic oil plants at Bohlen and Kamen were also attacked.Photographic cover obtained on the 3rd March of Politz, attacked on the night of the 8th February, showed tremendous damage throughout the plant. Itis estimated that it will be out of action for at least two to three months, and at thetime the photographs were taken there were no signs of repairs being carried out.2. German Towns.Two heavy attacks were made on the 13th/14th February on Dresden, thelargest city in Germany that had not been heavily bombed. Photographs obtained on the 15th February cover only part of the city on both banks of the River Elbe,but show that the area is almost completely devastated. It is expected that laterphotographs will confirm the tremendous damage throughout the whole townreferred to in the German and neutral press. Print No. 1 shows the very,heavy damage inflicted on Wiesbaden. Many industrial works and public buildings, including the gas works, the town hall and the post office, were severely damaged. Worms, a communication centre of great importance behind thewestern front,&apos; was heavily attacked, and the main town and southern industrial areas suffered severe damage.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.[29404]
Photographs show that outstanding success was achieved in the attack onPforzheim. Hardly a single building remains intact throughout the town and,apart from the tremendous number gutted by fires, many areas of buildings canbe seen levelled to the ground (see Print No. 2). Wesel, attacked three timesduring the period, suffered severe and widespread damage. In support of theland forces, attacks were also made on Cleve and Goch, and other towns attackedinclude Karlsruhe, Dortmund, Duisburg, Essen and Chemnitz. Mosquitoesbombed Berlin on eleven nights.3. Transportation Targets.The Mittelland Canal at Gravenhorst was again bombed on the 21st/22nd February. This stretch of the canal, which is sealed by two earth barriers,was completely obliterated, and all the work done in repairing the previousdamage was destroyed (see Print No. 3). The Altenbeken viaduct attacked onthe 22nd February by 17 Lancaster aircraft carrying 12,000-lb. Tallboy bombs,was severed at the north end over a length of some 140-150 yards. Attacks were also made on the Dortmund-Ems Canal aqueduct at Ladbergen, where repairswere seen to have made considerable progress, and on marshalling yards atKrefeld, Uerdingen, Cologne/Gremberg, Stuttgart/Kornwestheim, Hohenbudbergand on the main station at Munchen-Gladbach.4.. Naval Targets.The midget U-boat pens at Poortershaven were heavily damaged in anattack with 12,000-lb. Tallboy bombs on the 3rd February and every installationin the area was affected (see Print No. 4). Of four large buildings east of thebasin, one was practically destroyed, one severely damaged and the othersseriously affected by blast. The electric railway was severed in three places. Atleast one direct hit was secured with a Tallboy bomb on the U-boat pens atIjmuiden, and several near misses were obtained. The advanced U-boat base at Horten. was also attacked.5. Results of Previous Attacks.Print No. 5 shows the very severe damage at the Leuna (Merseburg) oil plantwhich it is expected will be inactive for at least two months. The attack on the synthetic oil plant at Zeitz on 16th/ 17th January is now shown by photographsto have been an outstanding success (see Print No. 6). All the vital units and nearly all the oil storage tanks and pipelines were destroyed or severely damaged.At the time the photographs were taken (one month after the attack) there were no signs of activity in the plant. The Fortsetzung benzol plant, bombed on the15th&apos; January, is seen to have sustained damage to the benzol building, theexhauster house, the coal washing plant, sulphate house, synthetic ammonia house and a large building east of the tar tanks has been virtually destroyed.Photographs of the Briickhausen benzol plant show that heavy damage wasinflicted on the benzol recovery plants and coke ovens, and that this plant also was inactive.Print No. 7 shows the damage inflicted on Hanau on 6th January. Thetyre factory of Deutsche Dunlop Gummi A.G. was heavily damaged and most ofthe sidings in the marshalling yard were still obstructed by derailed rolling-stockfive weeks after the attack. Almost the whole built-up area of Magdeburg was completely gutted in the raid on 16th/17th January. Print No. 8 shows part ofthe widespread devastation in the city, and Print No. 9 shows the severe damage caused at the August Thyssen Steel Works at Duisburg/Hamborn on22nd /23rd January.Prints Nos. 10 to 13 give an indication of the state in which the russian armies will find Stettin and Berlin. The photographs of Berlin were taken before the recent heavy attacks by the U.S.A.A.F.C. Sea Mining.Mines were laid in the Baltic in the main swept channels north of Rugenand the Fischland Bares peninsula and in all the main channels and approaches to ports in the Kattegat. The harbours of Oslo, Moss, Horten and Frederikstadwere all mined and also the Heligoland Bight and the approaches to the Elbe,Weser and Jade rivers. In the period from the 1st January to the 25th February20 ships are known to have been sunk and 15 damaged.A. H. M. S.&apos; Air Ministry, Wth March, 1945.
