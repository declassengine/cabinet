IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.1SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 162.Uth March, 1945.WAR CABINET.EELIEF FOR OCCUPIED HOLLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Cabinet, at its meeting of the 5th February (see War cabinet conclusions 14 (45) 6), approved a proposal by the Minister of State to sendcertain consignments of foodstuffs into occupied Holland, on the understandingthat this was an interim measure and that no further consignments would be approved until reports about the distribution of the first consignment had beenreceived. These reports were delayed, since distribution did not begin until theend of February, and meanwhile sanction was given for certain further shipments of relief goods from Sweden. The total now sent or authorised amounts to about16,000 tons.2. A detailed report from the Swedish Government and International red cross, who are supervising the distribution, has still not been received. a preliminary report from one of the leaders of the Resistance Movement in theNetherlands, dated the 4th March, runs as follows : &quot; The distribution of foodstuffs from the relief ships in Delfzijl is goingwell. The transportation and distribution is being carried out in a manner which, even in normal times, would be considered good.&quot;3. On the 23rd January the Netherlands Prime Minister, Dr. Gerbrand)^wrote to the Prime Minister a letter about relief for Holland, from which thefollowing is an extract :  &quot; If strategy in the West is such that the liberation of the Netherlandscannot be expected within a month, then I must ask on behalf of theNetherlands Government a definite promise that the one or two ships which,as I hope, are already on the way to Delfzijl for the relief of my sufferingcompatriots, will be but the first step in the establishment of a regularsupply service which can bring about a real measure of relief in north-western Holland so that the threatened annihilation of millions of Dutchmencan be prevented.&quot; Are there sufficient supplies available for this purpose in easternEngland, and, if so, can they be maintained? Will everything be done inorder to speed up this process 1 I sincerely trust that you can give me adefinite assurance on this question.&quot;4. As a result of this letter, the Prime Minister invited me to examine thepossibilities of a regular relief scheme and to ensure that the necessary pre-liminary planning was being done with all the Departments concerned. As a first step the matter was put to the Chiefs of Staff.5. The Chiefs of Staff have examined the matter and recall that general eisenhower stated last October that he supported the despatch of relief supplies to Holland and was prepared to accept the risk of part of these supplies falling into German hands. As regards the route by which the supplies would reachHolland, the Germans have hitherto suggested that all supplies should go via theKiel Canal. The Chiefs of Staff emphasise the importance of maintaining our freedom to take offensive action against the Canal, owing to its present importanceto the German war effort, and accordingly recommend that the Foreign Office, inconsultation with the Admiralty, should negotiate with the Germans for an12700   [29423]
alternative route for a regular relief scheme. On the assumption, that supplies will henceforward have to come from sources other than Sweden, the Chiefs ofStaff suggest two alternative routes, from westward to the Faroes, thence to thearea of the Naze and down the west coast of Denmark to Holland, or fromwestward up the Channel to Holland. The latter route seems the more desirable,but no objection is seen to the offer of both routes to the Germans for purposes of negotiation. No great hope can be pinned on German acceptance of eitheralternative since mine-sweeping commitments would be involved. The Chiefs ofStaff ask that if negotiations with the Germans for a route other than by theKiel Canal should fail, they should be afforded an opportunity of giving thematter further consideration.6. A further point is that at present relief supplies are unloaded at Delf zijland carried by inland water transport to the necessitous area further south.Accordingly, if an alternative unloading port nearer the distribution area canbe agreed with the operational authorities concerned, the task of distribution would be facilitated and expedited.7. Meanwhile, questions of shipping and supply have been under study.The Netherlands Government, at our suggestion, have asked the Swedish Govern-ment whether they can supply Swedish ships from the Baltic for this purpose,of which there are believed to be plenty available. His Majesty&apos;s Minister in stockholm has been asked to support this proposal. No reply has yet beenreceived from the Swedes.8. As regards supply, the Dutch have told us that they will need up to5,000 tons of food a week, consisting of about 4,000 tons of flour, 750 tons of margarine, and 250 tons of miscellaneous items. It appears that the Swedes willnot be in a position to supply anything further, and it is necessary to consideroutside sources of supply. The Foreign Office have been in consultation withthe Ministry of Food, who think that it would be exceedingly difficult for us tosupply the amounts required over any extended period. They are, however,examining the possibility of providing for a short interim period until suppliescan be obtained from a more remote source. Meanwhile the Dutch are in contact with the United States and Canadian Governments with a view to obtaining supplies for the later period.9.   I should be grateful for authority &apos;(i) To agree to the institution of a regular scheme of relief to the Nether-lands at the rate of approximately 5,000 tons of food a week, togetherwith certain medical supplies for which the Dutch have asked:distribution to be under the auspices of the Swedish Government orthe International Reel Cross or both.(ii) In consultation with the Admiralty, to negotiate with the Germansarrangements for a route for the ships carrying relief other than via the Kiel Canal, and if possible for an alternative unloading port. Ifthe Germans insist on Kiel, the matter to be referred back to the Chiefsof Staff.(iii) In concert with the Ministry of Food, to do our best to meet the Dutchsupply requirements for the interim period until North Americansupplies become available.A. EForeign Office, 14th March, 1945.
