naval SITUATION.General Review.I. There has been considerable midget U-boat activity off the Scheldt. .:Two U-boats have been sunk, two probably sunk, and one possibly sunk.Norwegian Waters.2. On the night of the 12th/13th Norwegian M.T.B.&apos;s off the S.W. coast of Norway torpedoed two 4,000-ton cargo ships, one of which sank.Home Waters.3. There was considerable midget U-boat and explosive motor-boat activityfrom the Hook of Holland to the Scheldt between the 11th and 13th. Some15 midgets were sunk by aircraft, frigates and M.Ls, and two, probably three,by shore batteries; in addition one was captured and others were damaged. Fourexplosive motor-boats were destroyed by aircraft and one by coastal craft; one was captured.On two nights of the week E-boats were active off the Dutch coast and onthe East Coast convoy routes, and were engaged by our patrols.On the 9th and 11th Allied raiding parties landed by night from assaultlanding craft on Schouwen and Overflakke Islands and near Nijmegen; the latterfoi-ce took 15 prisoners.4. In the early hours of the 9th an enemy force of 100 men from Jerseyin landing craft raided Granville (west coast of Cherbourg Peninsula). A U.S.patrol craft which intercepted was damaged and had to be beached. In additionto damaging shipping (see paragraph 19) the raiders also damaged the harbour and nine out of thirteen cranes, and withdrew on the arrival of Allied infantryreinforcements and before other coastal craft could reach the area. Some allied prisoners were taken.  One of the German craft ran aground and was scuttled.5. H.M.S. Onslaught (destroyer) and R.F.A. Black Ranger were damaged in collision off the Clyde on the 12th, but reached port.6. During the week ending the 11th the combined British and U.S.discharges through the liberated ports were 109,100 men, 12,652 vehicles, 374,400tons of stores, 29,200 tons of coal, 101.300 tons of petrol, and 77,600 tons ofammunition.North Atlantic.7. A.F.D. 66 (floating clock), in tow to Gibraltar, which had sustainedserious damage in persistent foul weather since the 3rd, foundered on the 10thin the Bay of Biscay.The French aircraft-carrier Beam was damaged in collision N.W. of the azores on the 13th. but has reached port.Mediterranean.8. On the night of the 9th/10th U.S. P.T. boats sank two armed lightersin the Gulf of Genoa and probably damaged two others.9. On the night of the 7th/8th British coastal craft attacked four ships off Pola; one ship was torpedoed and sunk and the others were hit by gunfire.On the night of the 9th/10th coastal craft sank an escorted ship of 2,500 tonswest of Istria.10. Khalkia Island (N.W. of Rhodes) has been evacuated by the Germans.East Indies.II. It is now known that Tamandu, on the Burmese coast, was capturedafter bombardment by sloops of the R.I.N. Landing craft subsequently ferriedtroops across the Dalet ferry, east of Akyab, at the rate of 2,500 per day. Since15th February 15,000 troops, 600 mules, and 3,000 tons of motor transport and stores, have been landed in this area from ships. Two flotillas of M.L.S havepatrolled the waterways.H.M. S/M Clyde on the 2nd sank an armed trawler in Molabo harbour(N.W. Sumatra) by gunfire.
Pacific.12.   U.S. ships have continued to bombard Chichi Jima and other northernislands in the Ogasawara group.13. On the night of the 9th/10th US. P.T. boats sank two small craft off33asilan Island (Southern Philippines). On the following night P.T. boats fromOrmoc sank two luggers off Cebu.14. The Dutch S/M Zwaardfasch, during a recent patrol, probably torpedo-doed an escorted ship of 5,000 tons in the Java Sea. The Zwaardftsch was slightly damaged in a counter-attack and suffered considerable damage in a laterattack by aircraft.Anti-Submarine Operations.15. During the week 35 attacks were reported, of which eight were by shore-based aircraft and 27 by warships.On the 11th a U-boat was sunk by a U.S. Liberator off the Scillies, andon the 13th another was sunk, possibly by a mine, off the south coast ofIreland (R); 48 of the crew landed and were placed under guard. R.C.N. frigatesof the 25th Escort Group probably sank one in St. George&apos;s Channel on the 7th,and another was probably sunk by a mine off Beachy Head on the 11th.H.M.S. Bulldog (destroyer) possibly sank one in St. George&apos;s Channel on the 7th.Enemy Intelligence.16. Reconnaissance of Swunemunde on the 9th showed the Scheer with ailher guns in place.The German naval tanker Ditmarschen (12,000 tons), which has been based in Northern Norway, is reported to have arrived in Stavangerfiord on the 5th.She was laden with ammunition and her deck was piled high with nets, possiblysome of the boom defence nets removed from Altenfiord. The Ditmarschen was employed as a depot ship for the Tirpitz and other warships, and probably carriedspare ammunition for these ships.The Norwegian self-propelled naval floating crane, with a lift of 250 tons,was sunk at Horten during the attack by aircraft on the night of the23rd/24th February. There is no other crane of this type or size in southern norway.17. i Photographic reconnaissance of Trieste shows a sunken Cavour classbattleship.18. Patrols have been maintained off the South and West Coasts, and maddition probably three U-boats are operating between the Orkneys and the Tyne.A number of U-boats are on passage to Canadian and U.S. waters.The strength of the effort which the German U-boat fleet is exerting continuesgradually to increase.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. A ship in an outward-bound ocean convoy was torpedoed and sunk bya U-boat off Beachy Head, and a small Swedish ship in coastal convoy was torpedoed and sunk off the Firth of Forth. A ship in coastal convoy was mined and sunk off Lowestoft. During the enemy raid on Granville one small ship was captured, another was set on fire and is a total loss, and two others wereU-boats.B
Protection of Seaborne Trade.21. During February 21 convoys of 489 ships arrived in the United kingdom without loss by enemy action, and one convoy from North Russia, originally of34 ships, lost two ships before arrival. A further 220 ships from ten of these convoys proceeded direct to Continental ports. Twenty-five outward-bound convoysof 605 ships, including one convoy of 26 ships to North Russia, reached their destinations without loss. Two ships were- sunk in an outward-bound convoywhich was still at sea at the end of the month. In UK. coastal waters 2,776 ships in 179 convoys reached their destinations; three ships were lost by enemy action.Fourteen U.S. convoys of 562 ships to and from Gibraltar reached their destinations; one ship was lost. In the Caribbean and W. Atlantic 388 ships in101 convoys, and in the Indian Ocean 67 ships in 36 convoys arrived without loss.Allied Minelaying.22. Surface craft laid mines in Home Waters. Aircraft laid mines in theKattegat and the Skagerrak and off the German North Sea coast.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.23. Midget U-boats are suspected of minelaying off the south-east coast ofthe UK. and along the north coast of France. E-boats may have laid mines inthe Channel on one night of the week. Mines are also thought to have been laidat Granville during the raid on the harbour.In the Mediterranean 81 mines have been destroyed south of Cephalonia.Italian sweepers are continuing to clear a minefield in the Gulf of Taranto. Itis now known that, in the week ending the 3rd, 172 mines were destroyed in the^aegean.The mine totals are 6,445 ground and 9.266 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.24. In addition to the 11 military transports which still ply regularlybetween Norwegian and Danish ports, at least 80 northbound enemy ships routedto Norway entered the Kattegat during February via the Sound and another 30via the Great Belt : a similar number passed southbound. This flow of shipping is still maintained, and it is believed that nearly 30 per cent, of these ships carrymilitary stores and ammunition and about 20 per cent, troops and equipment.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.25. During the week there has been little of importance to report from theSouthern sector.The chief events of the week have taken place on the front of the CentralGroup of Armies, where the Third United States Army has virtually cleared the Rhine and the Moselle on the whole of its sector. On the left of this Army,the First United States Army has occupied the west bank of the Rhine fromAndernach to north of Cologne, and has secured a bridgehead across the riverat Remagen.In the north, the Ninth United States Army has also reached the Rhineon the whole of its front and has assisted the First Canadian Army to complete the elimination of the Wesel bridgehead.Southern Sector.26. On the front of the First French Army, operations have been confined to patrol activity and harassing fire.In the Saarbrucken sector, the Seventh US. Army has continued pressure,whilst consolidating the capture of Forbach in spite of determined enemy counter-attacks.Central Sector.27. Most satisfactory progress has been made by the Third United states army on the right of the Central Group of Armies&apos;. Having broken through to the Rhine north of Coblenz, armoured forces of this Army expanded their
salient north and south and, on the 9th, made contact to the north with elements of the First U.S. Army advancing up the west bank of, the river. Bythe 11th, the Rhine had been cleared on the Army front with the exception ofa small pocket south of Andernach.   This pocket was eliminated on the 12th.Meanwhile, other armoured units of the same Corps had turned south, andhaving cleared the Rhine to Coblenz, on the 9th drove forward towards theMoselle on a 25-mile front. Simultaneously, the right of this Corps moved down the Moselle from Trier and on the 14th crossed the river on a two divisionalfront 15 miles S.W. of Coblenz. By the 14th the whole of the left bank of theriver was clear, with the exception of small isolated areas between Trabenand Cochem.Similar success has been achieved by the First U.S. Army. By the 7th,Cologne had been occupied; and the capture of Bonn was completed two days later. Thus, by the 9th, this Army had reached the Rhine along its entire front,and by the 12th all pockets of resistance in rear of the front line had beenliquidated. The outstanding achievement, however, of the First U.S. Army hasbeen the seizing and holding of a bridgehead at Remagen, where on the 7th therailway bridge was reached and found intact. The initial small bridgehead has since then been steadily expanded and strengthened against persistent attemptsby the enemy to eliminate it. The enemy has also made every effort, by shellingand bombing, to destroy the bridge, but has, so far, met little success. the bridgehead was, by the 14th, 10 miles wide and 5 miles deep; two additionalbridges have been constructed and three ferry services put into operation.Northern Sector.28. There is little to report from the greater part of the Ninth U.S. Armyfront on the Rhine, except on the left flank, where U.S. troops have assisted theBritish.and Canadians to wipe out the enemy bridgehead opposite Wesel. the elimination of this salient has proved a slow process. The heaviest fighting tookplace in the Xanten area, where, on the 8th, the First Canadian Army launcheda new attack to clear the town. On the 9th this attack was successful, and withAllied troops pressing him back along the whole perimeter, the enemy withdrewthe majority of his troops across the Rhine. By the next day all organised resistance had ceased.Russian Front.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)r n*n.jn29. The Germans report increased Soviet attacks against the Central sector of their front in Latvia, but state that the Russian attacks directed against Libauhave lost their impetus. There is still no mention by the Russians of any offensive action against this front.East Prussia.30. After a lull, the Germans reported on the 14th a large-scale Russianattack launched in the area S.W. of Konigsberg; so far, however, the russians have made only slight claims.Central Sector.31. The Russians now hold all the Baltic coast from north of Gdynia to north of Stettin, with the exception of Kolberg which still continues to hold out.Attacking from the areas east of Stolp and north and west of Marienburg theRussians have advanced with strong forces on Danzig and Gdynia. The capture of Puck on the 12th brought the Russians to a point on the Baltic coast less than15 miles from Gdynia, and they have since advanced further south round thecurve of this coast.It is not yet possible to form an accurate estimate of the number of german divisions now isolated in the Danzig pocket, but preliminary reports suggest thatthe figure may be between 15 and 20.Further to the west fierce fighting against the German bridgeheads acrossthe River Oder in the Stettin area is in progress. After stubborn fighting on theRiver Oder, east of Berlin, Kustrin was captured on the 12th.Strong Russian attacks in the direction of Moravska Ostrava have beenreported by the Germans, but the Russians have apparently made little progressso far. On the rest of the Central front there is no activity of importance to record. &apos;
Southern Sector.32. In Southern Slovakia, the Russians succeeded in capturing theimportant town of Zvolen on the 14th after heavy fighting.The Germans continue to claim progress against stubborn Soviet resistance to the N.E. and east of Lake Balaton. The strong forces which the Germans are believed to be using in this area and the fact that fighting has been reported inthe extreme south of Hungary across the River Drava may suggest that theGermans are once more trying to regain the line of the River Danube.Burma.33. On the night 12th/13th Allied troops made a landing on the coast west of Let pan.   Complete surprise was achieved and enemy opposition was slight.Fighting has continued in the area 6 miles N.W. of An and in the Dalet area.In Central Burma, motorised infantry operating from the Meiktila area,with armoured support, have patrolled N.W. to Wundwin and Thedaw. TheMandalay-Yamethin Railway has been blown 8 miles north of Thazi, and troops are astride the railway at Thazi itself. A firm patrolling base has been estab-lished at Yindaw, on the Meiktila-Pyawbwe road.After a rapid advance from their bridgeheads in the Kyaukmyaung area, an indian Division captured Madaya on the 8th, and on the same day reached thenorthern outskirts of Mandalay. Severe fighting is in progress within the city.The reduction of Fort Dufferin, which contains the main Japanese defenders, isno easy matter, but operations supported by the R.A.F. are in progress to effect a lodgment.Meanwhile, other forces are closing in from the east and the west. To theeast, Maymyo was occupied on the 11th, and the Maymyo-Mandalay railwaycut some 10 miles S.E. of Mandalay on the 13th. To the west, troops from theNgazun bridgehead are within one mile of Tada-U and 15 miles of Kyaukse.Mong Mit was occupied by British troops on the 10th. Chinese troopscaptured Namhsan on the 9th and have since made good progress south of the village. Other Chinese troops are now within 15 miles of Hsipaw, which theJapanese are reported to be evacuating.Philippines.34. Luzon, U.S. forces are still encountering determined enemy resistance in the area east and N.E. of Manila. In the Southern sector, they have made further progress, capturing Balayan, some 50 miles south of Manila on BalayanBay, and Batangas, which lies to the S.E. of Balayan.35. Mindanao.- -On the 10th, U.S. forces landed on the S.W. tip of Mindanaoagainst negligible opposition. A heavy bombardment by U,S- cruisers and destroyers preceded the landing. U.S. troops quickly seized the town ofZamboanga, and two airfields in the vicinity.Iwojima.36. The U.S. Marines have now captured the whole of No. 2 airfield, anddriven a wedge deep into the centre of the Japanese positions in the north ofthe island, reaching the cliffs overlooking the N.E. coast, and cutting the enemy forces in two.Latest press reports state that the campaign is now complete althoughJapanese resistance from isolated positions continues.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.37. Fighter Command flew 220 defensive sorties, including 127 against possible flying-bomb activity. Attacks against long-range rocket targets are referred to in paragraph 39.Home Waters,38. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 1,550 sorties; 6 aircraft are missing.
Attacks were made on shipping in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, off theNorwegian coast and in the Heligoland Bight; in the course of these operations,one destroyer, 7 ships of 2,000/5,000 tons, 2 coasters and one trawler type auxiliarywere hit.Swordfish and Beaufighters, and also Spitfires of Fighter Command, operatedagainst midget U-boats and explosive motor-boats off the Dutch coast (see NavalOiLUaLlOii,   pcxx cigx cijjjlx  ej.y.Navigational aids on the Norwegian coast were attacked on three days of the week.Bomber Command laid 449 sea-mines.Western Europe.39. In the week ended dawn on the 14th, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) flew13,452 sorties and dropped 7,266 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawn onthe 15th, aircraft of Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Bomber Commandflew 13,359 sorties and dropped 30,107 tons by day and 5,879 tons by night,while Fighter Command and the U.S. VIII Fighter Command, flew 5,382 sorties.One-hundred-and-thirty-two enemy aircraft were destroyed; 115 Allied aircraft are missing.The heavy and sustained attacks by our strategic bombers provoked com-paratively little enemy opposition. The tactical fighter effort by the G.A.F.was maintained at between 75 and 300 sorties per diem. Repeated attacks bysmall numbers of ground-attack aircraft were made against the bridgehead atRemagen, in the course of which a high proportion of the enemy was shot down.Heavy bombers operated throughout the week in great strength, but on almost every occasion cloud necessitated the employment of pathfinder technique.The highest tonnage to date in one attack on any single target was deliveredon the 12th, when 1,076 (out of 1,108 aircraft despatched) dropped 4,889 tons onDortmund. The bombing, which was through cloud, was concentrated; twoLancaster^ are missing out of all the aircraft, including escorting fighters, whichparticipated in this operation. Dortmund had also been attacked by Fortresseson the 10th (1,082 tons).The second noteworthy event of the week was the employment of the22,000 lbs. D.P. bomb. A bomb of this calibre was dropped by a Lancaster inan attack on a railway viaduct on the 14th.The second principal target was Essen, which was very heavily attacked by a force of over 1,000 aircraft on the 11th (4,738 tons).Over 10,000 tons were dropped by heavies on other railway and industrial centres, including Cassel (1,620 tons 2 attacks), Barmen (1,153 tons) andFrankfurt (960 tons).The viaducts at Arnsberg and Bielefeld and two railway bridges nearHerford were attacked on several occasions (total 1,233 tons); a preliminaryinterpretation of photographs show that 6 to 8 spans of the viaduct at Bielefeldwere destroyed.The bombing of benzol and synthetic oil plants was sustained, a total of ,300 tons being released. The main targets were the plant at Datteln (nearRecklinghausen), where photographs show that severe damage was caused from two attacks (1,137 tons), that at Buer (955 tons in two concentrated attacks), twoat Hamburg (1,107 tons), and that at Lutzendorf (near Halle 960 tons).Among other targets attacked were U-boat building yards at Bremen, Kieland Flamburg (2,529 tons), and the port area of Swinemunde (1,438 tons). good results are reported from two attacks on the aircraft component factory atHedderheim (near Frankfurt), and from attacks on three tank factories atHanover.The sequence of raids on Berlin by Mosquitoes was maintained withoutinterruption, and a total of over 500 tons was released.Small forces of Liberators dropped leaflets on every night of the week.Spitfires of Fighter Command continued their attacks on rocket targets in holland; over 600 sorties were flown on such missions from which good results are reported.In the battle area, widespread attacks in strength by aircraft ofS.H.A.E.F. (Air) were made on communications, defended localities, airfields and storage dumps. As visibility was moderate throughout the period with theexception of the 14th, results were generally unobserved and the number of enemy transport reported as destroyed is smaller than that of recent weeks. Aircover was provided over the Remagen bridgehead.
On the 14th, over 500 sorties were flown by medium bombers and more than2,600 by fighter bombers and fighters; excellent results are reported from these operations during the course of which over 100 enemy aircraft on the ground and over 2.500 road and rail vehicles were destroyed or damaged. On thefollowing night aircraft of Bomber Command attacked Zweibrucken andHomburg (both near Saarbrucken) dropping nearly 1,300 tons in clear weatherwith some ground haze; bombing was concentrated.Note. Appendix VII give Raid Assessments.Southern Europe.40. In the week ended dusk on the 12th. aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew13,414 sorties (including 2,742 by heavy bombers) and dropped 8,693 tons of bombs. Five enemy aircraft were destroyed; 71 Allied aircraft (including23 heavy bombers) are missing.Enemy air activity continued on a low scale.Railway targets were the primary objectives for the Strategic Air Force.The main attacks in Italy were against Verona (2 attacks 413 tons), Padua(201 tons) and the Verona/Parona railway bridge (642 tons in good concentra-tions); in Austria, against Graz (630 tons); in &quot;Hungary, against Hegyshalom(17 miles S. of Bratislava) where 700 tons were dropped, with excellent resultsincluding the destruction of or damage to over 350 railway vehicles, and inS. Germany against Regensburg (1,112 tons). All the sidings at Maribor (Yugo-slavia) were also cut or blocked in an attack by a small force of Liberators. an effective attack was also made on the oil refinery at Florisdorf (1.489 tons).Escorting and other fighters of the Strategic Air Force also carried outoperations against railway facilities, in the course of which 90 locomotives were destroyed or damaged in the vicinity of Knittelfeld, and 75 in the Regensburg/Munich area.The Tactical Air Force continued to attack successfully enemy communica-tions, strong points and ammunition and supply dumps in Northern Italy. Manybridges were heavily damaged, railways cut in over 400 places, and over 1,000road and rail vehicles destroyed or damaged.Aircraft of the Balkan Air Force maintained their operations against enemystrong points and communications in Yugoslavia, particularly in the Ljubljanaand Zagreb areas, and on Rah Island.Russia.41. The main effort reported by the Russian Air Force was that on theOder Front where tactical support in strength throughout the week was afforded to Marshal Zhukov&apos;s Army Group. Long-range bombers attacked Konigsberg,Danzig and Gdynia.Far East.South-East Asia.42. In the week ended dusk on the 12th, Allied aircraft flew 4,890 sorties,including 2,655 by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition, Dakota transport aircraft flew 7,481 sorties, carrying 5,425 men and 10,390 tons, and light transport aircraft flew 2,867 sorties, carrying 1,270 men and evacuating 419 casualties.Five Allied aircraft are missing.   Enemy activity was negligible.In Central Burma, the Tactical Air Force gave full support to Allied troops,successful attacks being made on enemy troop concentrations, gun positions,dumps, communications and airfields. Several bridges and dumps and manyM.T. vehicles and rivercraft were destroyed or damaged.In Lower Burma. Liberators bombed supply dumps at Rangoon and Prome(292 tons), railway sidings and jetties at Martaban and Sittang (290 tons) and bridges on the Burma-Si am railway (97 tons). Results were generally good andat least 4 important bridges were destroyed. Mustangs successfully attacked twoairfields, and Beaufighters shipping and communications. Railway targets inSiam were bombed by Liberators, which dropped 54 tons with good effect.In Malaya, Super Fortresses dropped 92 tons of bombs on Kuala Lumpur,where locomotive sheds and a large carriage shed were partially demolished,and 59 tons on oil storage facilities in the Singapore area.China Zone.43. Allied aircraft directed their main efforts against communications,especially in the Hankow, Peiping and Yellow River areas, where several railway centres were extensively damaged.   Good attacks were also made on shipping;
on the Yangtze and other rivers several steamers were sunk, and off the coast,at least 12 ships, including two 8.000-ton ships and two tankers of 10,000 and5,000 tons, were sunk or severely damaged.Samah airfield, in Hainan, was successfully attacked by 24 Mitchells, whichdestroyed or damaged 12 aircraft on the ground while escorting fighters destroyeda further five.In French Indo-China, Mitchells attacked communications and shipping; sixbridges were destroyed in the Hanoi area, and a tanker was sunk and another seton fire in Tourane harbour.Japan.44. Two hundred and eighty-five Super Fortresses dropped 1,145 tons ofincendiaries on Tokyo, and a further 284 dropped 1,294 tons on Nagoya, Tokyowas attacked both visually and by pathfinder technique and many large fires were started. At Nagoya, where weather was clear, scattered fires were seenthroughout an area of nearly two square miles of the city. Six Super Fortressesare missing.Pacific.45. In the Philippines, Liberators dropped 563 tons on enemy positions and concentrations in Luzon, particularly in the Antipolo area, and 705 tonson Zamboanga and other objectives in Mindanao, while Mitchells, Bostons and fighters provided close support for Allied troops.In Borneo, 55 Liberators bombed airfields and shipping; a ship believed to be an escort carrier was severely damaged.

The synthetic oil production has been stopped.Brunswick. Photographs taken on the 3rd March show that the 8th AirForce attack on the same day caused considerable additional damage to the con-structional steelworks of Wilkewerke A.G. Buildings affected include the press and forging shop, the large boiler smithery, and a generator hall. Moderate freshdamage has also been caused to the N.A.G. Armaments and M/T works atBussing.Chemnitz. Photographs taken on the 7th March after three attacks by the8th Air Force and a final attack by Bomber Command on the night of the 5th/6th,show fires still burning. The cover is partial, but it can be seen that the towncentre is almost entirely burnt out, and in the districts to the south the majority of buildings are gutted. Industrial property has suffered very heavily in thesouthern area, where virtually no factory premises have escaped damage.
Datteln. Photographs taken on the 9th March after attacks by the 8th AirForce on the 7th and by Bomber Command on the 9th show severe damage in both the north and south parts of tbe Emschelippe Benzol Plant where manybuildings, including six cooling towers, have been destroyed. In the course ofthese attacks the Dortmund-Ems Canal embankment was breached in two placesat the junction east of the Benzol plant, and an area of land measuringapproximately 500 by 1,000 yds. is flooded.Dessau. Photographs taken on the 9th March show that as a result of the bomber Command attack on the 7th/8th almost the whole of the city has beendevastated, leaving only squares of gutted business/residential buildings andbadly damaged industrial premises. All four of the Junkers works have beenmoderately to severely damaged, and most of the other important industries inthe town have been affected in varying degrees. Industries severely damagedare the KaloriferWerk Hugo Junkers G.m.b.H, the Dessauer Werke fur Zuckermid Chemische Industrie A.G., one of the largest German sugar refineries, theDessauer Waggon Fabrik, Schulthweis brewery and the machine works of Bamag-Meguin A.CJ. Moderate damage has been caused in the marshalling yard, wherethe passenger station, goods depots and several wagons have all been very severely damaged. The Leopold barracks and several buildings in the gas works havealso been wholly or partly destroyed.Dollbergen. Photographs taken on the 9th March show that, as a result ofthe 8th Air Force attack on the 3rd, severe damage was caused to the distillationplant of the Deutsche Gasolin oil refinery, as well as to offices and pipe-lines. Notrace of activity can be seen in the plant. Damage has also been caused to buildings in the smaller oil refinery of Erdol Werke, to the south-west.Harburg. Photographs taken on the 9th March after the Bomber command attack of the 7th /8th March show considerable new damage to installations,storage tanks and pipe-lines in the oil refineries of Rhenania Ossag A.G. andEbano Asphalt Werke A G;   Both plants are now inactive.Magdeburg. Photographs taken on the 9th March show that the 8th AirForce attacks on the 2nd and 3rd caused severe damage over the entire area ofthe synthetic oil plant of Braunkohle Benzin A.G. at Rothensee. All theimportant installations, including the injector-circulating house, the hydrogena-tion stalls, the distillation plant and the iso-octane plant have been more or less severely affected, and thirteen storage tanks have been destroyed.
