THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET./Copy No.&apos;7 ^W.P. (45) 149.7th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.RELIEF THROUGH THE BLOCKADE.Memorandum by Minister of State.THE French West Coast port of La Rochelle and the nearby islands ofOleron and Re are still in German occupation. On the 22nd January theInternational Red Cross informed the Foreign Office that, at the request of thelocal authorities, the German authorities had agreed to supplies being sent tothe civil populations of La Rochelle, Oleron and Re by a Red Cross ship sailing from a Spanish or Fighting French port at the expense of the French authorities.The French Embassy, from whom information was sought, replied on the15th February that La Rochelle had hitherto been receiving supplies by anoverland route. The supplies were distributed by Swedish delegates of theInternational Red Cross. This route had, however, been cut at the beginningof February owing to the destruction of the railways. The French Governmentwere therefore considering with the International Red Cross the means of organising supplies by sea.2. S.H.A.E.F. have agreed that relief supplies should be sent to the areas concerned, and no objections have been raised by departments here to the proposal,provided that the International Red Cross take upon themselves the responsibilityfor distribution.3. It is undesirable that a Portuguese ship should be used for bringing inthis relief, since the Portuguese are likely to press for additional shippingassistance to replace any vessel which they might charter for the purpose. Butit can no doubt be arranged with the International Red Cross that another typeof neutral vessel is used. The question of routeing could be agreed with theAdmiralty if the proposal to send relief is accepted in principle.4. We are not asked to furnish the supplies; that will be done either by theFrench or by the International Red Cross. But supplies by sea would presumablybe a technical breach of the blockade, though the position is closely analogous tothat of the Channel Islands in that supplies sent to these places cannot benefitGerman economy as a whole; and the fact that food has already been going tothem by land deprives the point of much of its importance.5. It is therefore suggested that as soon as the French have made their arrangements with the International Red Cross we should agree in principle togrant a safe-conduct for all future voyages of the ship to be employed for thispurpose.   The United States Government are. being asked to do likewise.R. L.Foreiqngn Office, 7th March, 1945.12692   [29390]
