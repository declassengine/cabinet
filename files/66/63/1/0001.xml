In the first section ofhis paper I set out what I regard as the indispensable conditions of a reparationpolicy which our- interests require. In the second section I set out the supportingarguments and elaborate my view that reparations and dismemberment must infact be alternative policies.1. The following conditions are, I submit, essential in our interests. I hopethat those who negotiate in detail on our behalf will be instructed to regard theirsatisfaction as indispensable : (1) We must not ourselves incur any expense arising out of the supply ofpermitted imports into Germany, whilst Germany is simultaneouslyexpected to make reparation deliveries whether these are of a once-for-all or of a current and continuing character. For this would mean, infact, that we were paying the German reparations to the recipients.We must, therefore, put it in the forefront of our conditions that anyrelief and further supplies, which may be agreed to be necessary to putGermany in a position to pay any reparations at all, shall be a first charge on any deliveries taken from her, and must be paid for in thefirst instance (in the appropriate proportions) by those receiving the deliveries, so long as the supplies required are exceeding the value of; Germany&apos;s overseas earnings apart from reparations. &apos; ,*(2) The permitted imports into Germany should be sufficient, but not morethan sufficient, to give effect to the Prime Minister&apos;s statement that&quot; &quot;it is not the purpose of the Allies to leave the people of germany without the necessary means of subsistence.&quot; &apos;(3) No once-for-all deliveries shall be taken from any Zone unless the allied control Commission have decided, in agreement with the occupying power, that they can be taken without risk of creating conditionswhich are contrary to the administrative interests of the occupying\ Power.(4) An occupying Power shall not be expected to take responsibility forsecuring any reparation deliveries beyond what it judges to be withinthe capacity of its Zone.[29376] B
2. Except with the assent of all the interested Powers no equipment orstocks shall be taken from parts of Germany which are to be detached from german sovereignty, whether for inclusion in Poland or (as may be the case in theWest) to form a Zone under international control.3. It is most unlikely that Germany will be in a position after meeting hernecessary imports to make current reparation deliveries on a substantial scale inthe first five years after the war. In the next five years much more should bepossible; but there is no basis at the present time for a realistic estimate of theprobable amount. Whatever may be obtained later, the net reparations in thefirst five years will consist mainly, or entirely, of the once-for-all deliveries(though the equivalent value of even these may be needed in large part to covernecessary imports) and the services of German labourers. It is most important,therefore, that the latter (i.e., services) should be included in the reparationaccount.4. Dismemberment will greatly impair Germany&apos;s capacity to makereparations. Indeed, reparations and dismemberment should be considered asbeing mainly alternatives. A sound scheme of reparations on any substantial scale implies and requires a unitary German Government which can be made responsible fox that delivery. To dismember Germany under the occupation of four several Powers, who cannot themselves take the responsibility of procuringreparation deliveries from their Zone,, does not lend itself to the working out of.any sound scheme of reparations on any lines hitherto discussed.- 5.   Subject to the above, let the reparations be as large as possible.   But letthere be no misapprehensions in the minds of any of us about the real prospects.6. It may be that there is nothing in the above incompatible with thefundamental objectives of Russian policy and that that policy as developed atYalta is the result of an impressionist view from which the Russians could beweaned away without much difficulty.,7. It should also be for consideration whether in order to maintain theprinciple of the collective responsibility of the occupying Powers, we ought atthe present stage to refrain from giving any undertaking to occupy germany for a longer period than that for which the four occupying Powers will eachand all be prepared to make themselves responsible.II.8. The economic issues which arise upon the surrender of Germany maybe considered under the headings of : (a) The responsibilities of our Zone of operations;(b) Reparations;(c) Dismemberment. , -9. Responsibilities of our Zone of Occupation. Our Zone is not self-supporting in foodstuffs. It would be from Brandenburg, Pomerania and east prussia that the Zone would draw additional foodstuffs and also from overseasimports. In the early post-surrender period we are not likely to obtain much from the Eastern Zone or much more from the American South-Western Zone.Our Zone is not only deficient in foodstuffs; it is the most dependent upon an industrial economy. It is likely also to have its normal population swollenby refugees from Eastern Germany.10. I think it is certain that Western Germany as a whole, and certainlyour Zone, will need relief imports in the early post-surrender period. Whateverpublic opinion may profess in advance about leaving Germany to stew in her ownjuice, I am certain that it will not be a practicable policy to have a British army of Occupation in our Zone surrounded by semi-starving and partially homelesswomen and children. The soldiers would be the first, as they were after the last war, to break down any such policy.We are in no position to support this Zone from our own resources or topurchase requirements for it from abroad. We can follow no policy other thanthat described in paragraph 1 (1) of Section I of this paper.11. Reparation. Our short experience in part of Italy has already shownwhat, enormous sums might be involved in maintaining a minimum standard ofliving for our Zone of Occupation in Germany. If, however, we were con-contemplating a situation in which a Zone, already dependent for its life on an&apos;
industrial economy, had been unduly stripped of its national wealth for reparations, over and above immediate relief needs, large sums would be requiredfor working capital. For this reason it is, in my view, essential that we should adhere to the principles set out in paragraph 1 (3) and that an occupying power should not be expected to take responsibility for securing any reparation deliveries beyond what it judges to be within the capacity of its Zone. If, forexample, Russia, in pressing her claim for her agreed share of reparations,demanded that any deficiency in the value of that share which could be obtainedfrom her own Zone must be made good by reparations deliveries from the otherZones, our liabilities for our Zone might be seriously increased.Moreover, if we were to allow a situation to develop in which each occupying power had sole responsibility for its own Zone, then we might be faced with avery alarming prospect. For this reason it must be one of our prior aims toensure that the principle of collective responsibility of the occupying Powers,as a whole, will be maintained see paragraph 7 above.12. There are also certain more general considerations as to the effect of reparation payments on the economy and well-being of Europe as a whole. TheRussian proposal envisages a large once-for-all delivery of all kinds of materials,machinery and transport and other forms of &quot; German national wealth,&quot; within two years, and a further delivery annually over a period of ten years, the value ofthe reparations to be fixed in advance This policy would obtain some immediatecompensation for the destruction that the Germans have carried out in Russiaand would reduce Germany&apos;s industrial strength so that for a number Of yearsshe would be able to do little more than rebuild her immediate physical necessities.A policy of this kind produces some economic security against Germany. Thewhole German standard of living will be reduced and the Russians have made it plain that they think this just. But it is not only the German standard of livingthat will be affected. I am in full agreement that our policy towards Germany&apos;industrial and economic structure must be conditioned to the needs of security;the Germans must adapt themselves to this, and we and other countries who willbe affected must adjust the interplay of our economies accordingly. We must,however, remember that Germany is a source of supplies and a market to much ofEurope as well as to ourselves. At first the standard of living in Europe may belowered by these changes in the centre of its economy, but if security is achievedthis should correct itself before long. But the further we take the spoliation orenforced changes of Germany&apos;s economy beyond the full needs of security, theslower will be the climb back to higher general standards in Europe. Also Ithink the greater will be the risk of social convulsion in Germany which wouldtake forms dangerous to the stability of Western European political institutions,especially as Western Europe will be, at the best, very sick economically. As the occupying Power we should have to deal with these social disturbances inGermany and our action would be open to every kind of misrepresentation both here and in other countries.13. Dismemberment. But I think we move into still graver consequences ifthe dismemberment of Germany which the Russians are urging means not merely the slicing off of part of Eastern Germany to give to Poland, and possibly thecreation of some special &apos;&apos; international system&apos;&apos; in the industrial part of western Germany (a scheme whose practicability should not be lightly assumed),but the break-up of the unitary German State and the creation of three (or four)separate German States which must be made both economically and politicallyself-supporting, and must be compelled to remain separate.I will not discuss here what I consider to be the grave political difficulties and consequences of the policy of an attempt to break up a unitary Germany. Itis sufficient to say that I believe that public opinion here and in the commonwealth and in the United States is not in any way ready for the implications oJf such adecision and that, if we persisted in. it, it would meet a growing resistance inGermany, and indeed provide a rallying cry for the more dangerous elements inthat country. There has been a paper discussing the question whetherdismembered States, based roughly upon the Zones of Occupation, would be economically viable. (Summary attached.) Those conclusions might needmodification in the light of the Yalta talks.But I have seen no paper discussing the means by which political stabilitywould be established in the separate States or their separateness maintained and enforced. If we attempt such a policy, we must be prepared for a strong Occupa-tion for a considerable time and this involves us in heavy commitments I am[29376] &apos; B 2
here concerned with the economic implications and consequences of dismember-ment, and raise as examples of economic issues the questions whether the separateStates are to be forbidden to have a Currency and Customs Union with each other,whether labour standards and the development of a free Trade Union movementare to be confined to the States or permitted a national basis, and what is to bedone with such &quot;unitary &quot; services as transport and communications.14. But apart from such considerations which require study, it is my viewthat we can have either a reparations policy or a dismemberment policy, butcertainly not both. A practicable reparations policy must be one which leavesto the Germans some prospects of a minimum subsistence, and, to the extent towhich reparations deliveries are to go on over a period, prospects of some exportswhich will pay for necessary imports. It is only by bringing the totality of theGerman economy within the field of reparations that a policy of substantialreparations which would fulfil these conditions is possible.All this is affected by the American decision to withdraw their occupyingtroops from their Zone at the end of two years. Two years is the period whichthe military authorities regard as necessary to achieve disarmament. By theend of that period we cannot hope to have achieved more than the first steps towards clearing up the economic and political chaos in Germany, and possibly to have made some progress with once-for-all reparations deliveries. If the UnitedStates Zone is to be developed into a new South-Western German State, thenAmerican interest, both during the period of Occupation and after is likely tobe limited to the fortunes of that area. It is probable that in the end they would put financial help at the disposal of the area as some justification for withdrawingtheir troops. But it is essential to us that the help of America should beconsistently extended to the economic problem of Germany as a whole, or at anyrate of Western Germany.15. Unless we are able to maintain the principle of a unitary German State,both for reparations and necessary relief imports, then we face a financial andeconomic liability which we have no means of discharging, except at the cost ofmaking our own people pay, not only for the defeat of Germany, but also for itsrevival.Many of these heavy charges would fall upon us in the early period. Wehave to maintain an Army of Occupation, to wage the war against Japan, tostrengthen our garrisons, to finance relief and to help to restore our damagedColonies and Dependencies in the East. Even if some of this money will comeback to us one day, the costs have to be financed meanwhile. Our reserves aredangerously inadequate, and we are borrowing largely from poor countries towhom repayment of the debt will be essential for their development. At present :- believe we can see our way to carry this debt and by our own energies to repayit over a number of years. We may perhaps hope for some help from the UnitedStates, but we dare not become financially dependent upon them.16. If we have to assume that the Russian Zone of Occupation will gradually include the area of Berlin and develop into a governmental or administrative system which is amenable to Russian policy, then at least we ought to consider whether there should not be a unified Western Germany whichcan be fitted into the general economy of the Western European countries.17. In the grave issues we have to face we must, above all things, be sure that our policy rests solidly upon the considered judgment of our own people andof the Commonwealth, and that it is a policy which is within our means, bothphysical and financial. Then it can be unequivocally stated and resolutelypursued by us and our successors. If certain trends in the Yalta discussions are allowed to develop into firm conclusions without substantial modification, theresult might well prove beyond the financial strength of this country and of theCommonwealth which looks to us for help and would impair our &quot;capacity forproper leadership in Europe.&apos; J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,7th March, 1945.
Extract from E.I.P.S./P. (44) 30 (Final) of 2nd September, 1944.Summary.Our conclusions may therefore be summarised : (a) Dismemberment would weaken the internal economic strength of\ Germany.   It would cause great initial dislocation and give rise tovery difficult problems, particularly in the fields of administration,finance and property.(6) Dismemberment would strengthen economic security in so far as theStates would become more dependent on non-German countries; on theother hand it might be difficult directly to limit the output of certainstrategic industries since this might reduce the standard of living inthe new States to a point at which their continued independence mightbe jeopardised.(c) Dismemberment would reduce Germany&apos;s capacity- to make reparations.(d) Dismemberment would decrease trade between the three new States and increase their trade with non-German countries.(e) Dismemberment,   by   impoverishing   Germany   and  impeding  worldrecovery, would probably be harmful in the long run to Britisheconomic interests.(/) We make no recommendations as to when the political act of dismember-ment should, take place, but draw attention to the need for maintainingsome organs of central economic administration in Germany for aperiod after the cessation of hostilities.(g) Dismemberment would considerably add to the burden on Allied Govern-ments of control and supervision in the economic field.In reaching these conclusions we have been bound to assume that, in order to. achieve effective dismemberment, the new States would not be allowed to havepreferential tariff or other arrangements designed especially to encourage trade or financial relations with each other. These prohibitions would be very difficultto enforce particularly in the early stages when there would be strong economicincentives to evade them. Even if they could be enforced, however, our general conclusion is that the economic disadvantages of dismemberment would be verygreat. While we appreciate that political and strategic arguments in favour ofdismemberment may be decisive, we are of the opinion that the full substance of partition is likely to prove unattainable in the economic field.
