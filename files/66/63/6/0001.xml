THIS DOCUMENT IS THE&apos; PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 194:5.SECEET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 151.8th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.STATUTORY ORDERS (SPECIAL PROCEDURE) BILL.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.THE terms of the enclosed Bill were approved by the Legislation committee at their meeting on the 6th March, and I was invited, in consultation with theLord Advocate and the Solicitor-General, to seek the approval of the War cabinet for its introduction in the House of Commons.2. The Bill is intended to give effect to the announcement, a copy of whichis appended (Appendix), made by the Prime Minister in the House of commons on the 20th June, 1944. The Bill has been prepared by a Sub-Committee of theMachinery of Government Committee under the Chairmanship of the Solicitor-General. In the course of its preparation the Sub-Committee consulted the officials of the two Houses, a number of whose suggestions have been incorporated in the Bill. Further consultation took place between the Chairman of theMachinery of Government Committee (the- Chancellor of the Exchequer) andthe Lord Chairman of Committees and Chairman of Ways and Means. Whileit would not be fair to say that the whole of the apprehensions expressed by theHouse authorities have been or can be wholly met, it is believed that the twoChairmen fully recognise the case for a Bill of this nature and agree with its general principles.3. The object of the Bill is to provide a new system of dealing with orders which are of a local character and involve interference with private rights. Thesystem is intended to secure on the one hand that the Order will, if necessary,be scrutinised much more closely and effectively than is possible under theprocedure of Negative or Affirmative Resolution on the Floor of the House and,on the other, to avoid the expenditure of time, effort and money involved in theexisting procedures by way of Provisional Order and Private Bill and at thesame time to give the Government of the day a more effective method of dis-charging their responsibility where national interests are concerned, than they-have under the existing procedures. To secure this, the Bill provides for the presentation of petitions against an Order by private parties affected whilethe Order is before Parliament, but draws a distinction between objections whichgo,to the root of the whole Order and those which merely seek to amend it inone or more particular respects. The conception underlying the Bill is thatthe former will normally be dealt with on the Floor of the House whereas thelatter will be referred for detailed examination to a Joint Committee of bothHouses. It has been recognised that in practice it may be difficult to draw thisdistinction in all cases and for that and other reasons the Bill provides that even in the case of a &quot;general objection&quot; either House can, if it thinks fit,refer the Bill to the Joint Committee. In this respect the proposed procedurediffers from the terms of the Prime Minister^ announcement and it is believedthat this concession will help the passage of the Bill.4. The procedure laid down by the Bill is required in the first instance to replace the old Provisional Order procedure in various provisions of the Townand Country Planning Act, 1944. These provisions were inserted by way ofa stop-gap pending the introduction of the present Bill, but it was intendedby the Government, and understood by Parliament, that they would in due course be amended so as to introduce the new procedure.   It is also required for* i-i.P.c. (45) 9th Meeting, Minute 3.&quot;[29391] b
2the Water Bill now before Parliament and is likely to be needed for several other Bills now in course of preparation, including a Bill to deal with the boundaries of local authorities.5.   In broad outline the way in which the Bill is intended to work is asfollows : (a) The Order is to lie on the Table of each House for a period of fourteen days, during which petitions may be presented against it.  After that,a further period of fourteen days ensues during which a resolution to       )annul the Order may be passed by either House.  If such a resolution is. passed the Order (as under existing procedure) is dead.(b) If a petition on a matter of detail is presented against the Order, the petition stands automatically referred to a Joint Committee of bothHouses, who may amend the Order so far as necessary to give effectto the petition. If this Committee (rejecting the petition) report theOrder without amendment, it takes effect without further proceedings.If they amend it, the Minister in charge can either accept the order as amended (in which case it takes effect without further proceedings)or, if he is not prepared to accept the amendments, can withdraw it.Alternatively, if the Order is not withdrawn and he wishes to pursue the matter, he may incorporate, the Order as amended by the JointCommittee in a Bill and invite Parliament to amend the Bill so as to restore the original Order. The Bill is treated as having reachedReport stage so as to avoid duplicating proceedings.In this case it is necessary to proceed by Bill, as otherwise therewould be no machinery for resolving differences between the two houses.(c) If a petition of general objection (i.e., one going to the root of the Order)is presented, either House may, as already stated, order that the petition be sent to the Joint Committee if they think fit. Under the. * Bill such an Order may be made by the House on the consideration ofa motion to annul the Order, but it is contemplated that normally theGovernment would advise the House not to take this course. If thatadvice is accepted, and there are no petitions which are automaticallyreferred to the Joint Committee as mentioned in paragraph (b), theOrder takes effect. If, on the other hand, a petition of generalobjection is referred to the Joint Committee, the Committee may eitherreject the petition and pass the Order, or may amend or reject theOrder. Where the Order is reported by the Committee with or withoutamendment, the consequences are as described in paragraph (b) above.Where the Order is rejected by the Committee the Minister can, ifhe wishes to press the matter, put the Order (as originally laid) intoa Bill, but otherwise the Order drops. The procedure on any suchBill is the same as that described above.6. In the application of the Bill to Scotland a modification of the generalprocedure is proposed in the light of the experience gained during the last50 years of the working of the Scottish Private Legislation procedure. Broadly,the intention is that in the case of Orders applying only to Scotland the initialenquiry, where one is required, should be held in Scotland before Commissioners(normally members of both Houses of Parliament) appointed under the PrivateLegislation Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1936, and should extend to the substance of the Order as well as to the objections to it. It has been found in the case ofprivate legislation that, where an enquiry of this sort is held and the views of theCommissioners are given effect, a further Parliamentary enquiry is rarely askedfor. The Bill therefore proposes that Scottish Orders which are not at variance with the recommendations of the Commissioners should be referred to the joint select Committee only if either House so resolves. In other respects such Orderswill be subject to the same Parliamentary procedure as Orders applying toEngland and Wales. Where the Ministry concerned is in disagreement with therecommendations of the Commissioners he will have to schedule the Order toa Bill which will like Confirming Bills in those cases where a Minister disagreeswith the Joint Select Committee be treated as having reached the Report Stage.. - . &apos; . &apos;        -   -    &apos; &apos; E B.  &apos;    - &apos;Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,8th March, 1945.
APPENDIX.Sir A. Gridley (C. Stockport) : To ask the Prime Minister whether he hasany further statement to make on the subject of a modified system for theParliamentary review of Ministerial Orders which was forecast in the white paper on a National Water Policy.The Prime Minister: As forecast in the White Paper on a National WaterPolicy (Cmd. 6515), the Government will, in the course of their reconstructionprogramme, ask Parliament for power to make Orders for certain purposes whichin normal circumstances would be dealt with by private or Provisional OrderBill; and Orders of this kind will require special procedure for securing effectiveParliamentary control in matters affecting the rights of individuals. instances of the kind of Order for which such a review would be appropriate were givenin that paper, namely, Orders dealing with the compulsory amalgamation andcombination of undertakings, alternation of limits of supply, scheduling of areas for water conservation, and the compulsory purchase of water rights; but many other instances will be thrown up by other reconstruction legislation, includingvarious types of Orders (mainly relating to statutory undertakers) for which provision is intended to be made in the forthcoming Bill dealing with Town and country Planning.For these Orders the procedure by way of Provisional Order ConfirmationBill, with its numerous stages, is unduly cumbrous in view of the urgency of thereconstruction period. On the other hand, if the Orders were merely laid beforeParliament subject to annulment by a resolution moved by a Member, there wouldbe no room for the entertainment of objections from private interests affected,objections which would often be based on evidence of a technical character.Accordingly the Government have under consideration a proposal, upon whichthey will wish in due course to take the sense of Parliament, for a fresh systemof Parliamentary review of Orders combining certain features of each of thepresent system.The Orders in question have something in common with hybrid Bills in thatthey will give effect to decisions of national policy and at the same time &quot; affectprivate rights &apos;&apos;; and the main object of the new system would be to secure thatthe question of national policy, if challenged, should be determined on the floor of the House, and that subject thereto the interests of private persons affectedshould be considered by a procedure corresponding to the procedure on aprivate Bill.Orders made subject to such new procedure would, after any local inquiryor other preliminary proceeding required by the relevant statute, be laid beforeboth Houses of Parliament for a stated period, during which objection couldbe taken thereto either by negative resolution moved by a Member of the Houseor by petition. It would not, however, be open to petitioners, as it is on a provisional Order Confirmation Bill, to petition against the main purposes ofthe Order. If any petitions were duly presented, the Order would stand referredto a Select Committee, which would normally be a joint committee of both Houses;the petitioners would be entitled to appear and be heard upon the particularmatters raised by their petitions, and the committee would have power to amend the Order. The Order would thus normally be disposed of either within theoriginal period for which it is laid or, if opposed in detail by private interests,after one Parliamentary stage. In two exceptional cases further proceedingswould be required, namely (1) If the Government found it necessary to ask Parliament to reconsideramendments made by the joint committee on the Order; and(2) Where for special reasons it was desired that an Order should beconsidered by separate committees of the Houses.In these cases the situation would have to be met by the introduction of aBill to which the Order would be scheduled, but the passage of such a Bill couldbe accelerated by the elimination of all except essential stages.In the case of Orders relating to Scotland the procedure would probably be slightly different and related to that prescribed, in lieu of procedure by privateBill, by the Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1936, which^ makes provision for inquiry by Parliamentary Commissioners in Scotland.These proposals have not yet been worked out in full, but it is intended toput a detailed scheme before Parliament as soon as possible. The Governmentcontemplate that the new system should in due course replace the present systemof Provisional Order Confirmation Bill.[29391]
