THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 180.20th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.CZECHOSLOVAK FRONTIERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 8th January I circulated to my colleagues (W.P. (45) 16) the draftof a formula regarding the right of the Czechoslovak Government to exerciseadministrative control within Czechoslovakia^ pre-Munich frontiers after thecountry&apos;s liberation. I proposed that, when this formula had been informallyagreed with the Czechoslovak Government, the United Kingdom representative onthe European Advisory Commission should communicate it to his colleagues and invite them to accept it. The War Cabinet approved these proposals (WarCabinet Conclusions 7 (45), Minute 5, of the 22nd January).2. The formula has since been discussed with President Benes by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. The President took exception to the references in the second paragraph of the formula to the &quot; arrangements reached at Munich in 1938,&quot; and he also pressed for elucidation of the distinctionbetween administrative control and sovereignty contained in our draft. I have felt able to meet Dr. Benes&apos;s wishes over these two points and have authorisedHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to inform the Czechoslovak Government that HisMajesty&apos;s Government, for their part, would be prepared to accept the revisedformula which I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues. the czechoslovak Government have confirmed that this revised formula is equallyacceptable to themselves. It will accordingly be communicated to the european advisory Commission by the United Kingdom representative, who will, at asuitable opportunity, inform his colleagues that it represents the views of HisMajesty&apos;s Government on this particular question, and will enquire whether their Governments would also be ready to accept it, with a view to the czechoslovak government being informed that these are the views of the four Powers repre-sented on the European Advisory Commission.A. E.Foreign Office, 20th March, 1945.Formula.In his note of the 5th August, 1942, addressed to the Czechoslovak Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, Mr. Eden declared on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom that, as Germany had deliberately destroyed the arrange-ments concerning Czechoslovakia reached in 1938, His Majesty&apos;s government regarded themselves as free from any engagement in this respect. Mr. Edenadded that, at the final settlement of the Czechoslovak frontiers to be reached atthe end of the war, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be influenced by any changes effected in and since 1938.Bearing this declaration in mind, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom for their part agree that the Czechoslovak Government should exercisefull political authority from the date of the unconditional surrender of Germanythroughout the area bounded by the frontiers of Czechoslovakia as these existed before the 31st December, 1937. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider, however,fhat the question of the final settlement of the Czechoslovak frontiers must remainin abeyance until the international frontiers in Central Europe are definitely laiddown in the peace settlement.Copy No.12719   [29474]
