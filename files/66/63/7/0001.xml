THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy of letter from President Roosevelt to the Prime Minister, dated10th February, 1945.Dear Winston,I have been hoping to find an opportunity in the course of the presentconferences to have a brief word with you on the importance which I attach to aprompt resumption at a high level of conversation between our two governments on the implementation of Article VII of the Lend-Lease Agreement. As theopportunity for a quiet discussion between us on this matter may still not developI do not wish this meeting to close without sending you a brief word on thismatter.Discussion on commercial policies pursuant to Article VII has been carriedon from time to time between our two Governments ever since the fall of 1943.I think it most important that these talks be re-invigorated and I should like tosuggest the prompt naming of full delegations on both sides to be headed bya Chairman with the rank of Minister. I hope you will find it possible to takethe necessary steps to bring this about insofar as your Government is concerned.Most sincerely yours,F. D. R.Copy of letter from the Prime Minister to President Roosevelt, dated13th February, 1945.My dear Franklin,1. I have to thank you for your letter of the 10th February about Article VIIof the Lend-Lease Agreement. I cabled this home to the Cabinet and have now had a full reply from them. It appears that during the past six weeks therehas been a regular series of discussions in London between a group of highBritish officials and three American officials led by Hawkins, who was head ofthe division in the State Department which deals with Commercial Policy andis now attached to the American Embassy. You may remember that discussionstook place in this form at the suggestion of the. State Department and were designed to ascertain informally, without of course committing either Govern -ment, where both countries now stood as a result of consideration since the talks in Washington rather more than a year ago. Although Commercial Policy wasthe. main subject, the talks covered the whole range of Article VII and seemedto our people to have let light into many obscure corners.2. Mr. Hawkins went back a week ago to Washington to report and is dueto return to London at the beginning of next month to tell us the Washingtonreaction to the talks. We shall then be able to consider with all practicable speedwhether such differences as may be found to remain between the United Statesand the United Kingdom can be bridged and if so, what should be lines ofprocedure for consideration of policy by other United Nations.3. The War Cabinet do not wish to commit themselves at this stage of thewar to sending a high-powered delegation to Washington. This must involvebringing other countries into the discussions, notably France, at an early stage and of course the present mood of the Dominions must be ascertained before wego further on general policy.4. In view of the above, would it not be better to wait till we have bothreturned home and have been able to review the progress made in the informal discussions ?  I shall be very glad to talk this over with you when we meet.Yours very sincerely,w. s. c.[29389]
