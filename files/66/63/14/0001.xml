THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 159.l&amp;th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.FRANCE : SUPPLY QUESTIONS.Memorandum by the Minister of State.IT was arranged with M. Bidault during his visit that M. Alphand, theDirector of the Economic Department of the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs,should set out the desiderata of the French Government on supply matters at ameeting at the Foreign Office under my Chairmanship. This meeting was heldon the 26th February, and was attended by representatives of the British andFrench Supply Departments. The main points raised by the French at themeeting were later summarised by the French Ambassador in a letter to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the 28th February, a translation ofwhich is attached&apos;. At M. Alphand&apos;s request I undertook to bring the Frenchrequirements to the notice of the War Cabinet.2. It was arranged at the meeting that the various points raised should bediscussed in more detail between representatives of the competent British andFrench Departments. Following -upon these discussions, the position in regardto the various items mentioned in M. Massigli&apos;s letter is now as follows : (a) Coal. The Ministry of Fuel and Power have explained to the french representatives the difficulties of our own coal position, which makeit impossible to ship to France any coal in addition to the quantitiesnow being exported to Supreme Headquarters, Allied ExpeditionaryForce.(b) Fats, meats and dried vegetables. The French later changed their request to 30,000 tons of meat, 50,000 tons of sugar and 10,000 tons offats, dropping the dried vegetables. The Ministry of Food feel thatthey cannot provide any meat or sugar, but at the request of theForeign Office they have not yet given a final answer to the French.As regards fats, the Ministry have offered 5,000 tons with the possi-bility of a further 2,000 tons.(c) Wheat-The Ministry of Food do not expect to be able to make any wheatavailable.(d) Steel, paper and paper pulp. As regards steel, specifications are awaitedfrom the French. It is unlikely that the Ministry of Supply can helpover paper or paper pulp seeing that they have already supplied2,000 tons of newsprint in response to a recent emergency demand from the French. Our difficulties have been explained to the french representatives and they have been told that a request that they havemade for 1,000 tons of printing paper cannot be considered withouta full supporting statement, which has not yet arrived.(e) Shipping for lifting supplies from the French colonies. The Ministryof War Transport have agreed to make available to the French50,000 tons deadweight of French shipping at the earliest possible moment to carry to France from the French Empire goods covered bythe agreed programmes. This tonnage would-be found from French&quot;List B&quot; ships, i.e., vessels under French control but subject inrespect of employment to the approval of the British and United12699   [29414]
States authorities. The existing charters of the ships would not be cancelled but would be regarded as suspended while they were engaged in the employment for which the allocation was made. TheMinistry have also agreed to allocate 30,000 tons deadweight of pooltonnage loading in March and April for one voyage from West africa to France to assist in lifting the French oil-ssed programme.3. The foregoing shows that our response to these specific French requestshas not so far been very encouraging : indeed, there is no certainty that we can give them even partial satisfaction except in regard to fats and shipping. Onthe other hand, we have already responded well to earlier &quot; spot demands &quot; fromthe French for specific items which they regarded as indispensable to keep theireconomy going and which could not be obtained in time from more distantsources. Apart from the 2,000 tons of newsprint mentioned above we have fullymet a spot demand for 30,000 tons of seed wheat and have supplied a &quot;large quantity of seed potatoes. We are also making a big effort over railway wagons and lorries (for details see War Cabinet Paper W.P. (45) 134, of the 5th March).4. One important point made by M. Alphand at the meeting is not brought out in M. Massigli&apos;s letter. M. Alphand asked whether at this stage of thewar the time had not come when the United Kingdom could safely afford to help the French by drawing on its own stocks. He realised that it would probablybe impossible to meet the present French demands without a reduction of thosestocks beyond the minimum which His Majesty&apos;s Government had hithertoconsidered indispensable and he hoped that Ministers would seriously considerthe possibility of permitting such a reduction for the sake of preserving theeconomic stability of the liberated areas.R. K. L.Foreign Office, 13th March, 1945.M. Massigli to Mr. Eden.Mr. Secretary of State, French Embassy, 28th February, 1945.AS was agreed, the economic questions which were to be raised by M. Bidaultwere examined on the 26th February during a meeting at the Foreign Office.M. Alphand, accompanied by French experts, explained to Mr. Richard Lawand to the British officials the great difficulties with which the ProvisionalGovernment are at present faced. The British Government is fully informed of the distressing situation for the people of France which results from these difficulties, and I am concerned simply to draw your personal attention to theconclusions of the exposition made by M. Alphand.M. Bidault will himself have told you that the help which we expect in thesedifficult times from Great Britain should bear essentially on the followingpoints  (a) Coal. Imports have not passed on the average 150,000 tons a month sincethe liberation, although 400,000 tons (about) are earmarked each month from the French national production for consumption by the allied armies. Importation should be raised at least to 400,000 tons, whichwould correspond to the facilities for discharge in French ports, but would be below the real needs of our industry and would simply allow the avoidance of the paralysis with which it is now threatened.(b) The delay caused by circumstances to the execution of the import pro-grammes makes the position in regard to French supplies in fats,meats and dried vegetables particularly acute. Rations, alreadyinsufficient, will have to be reduced in a short time. Therefore, we ask you to advance us, for repayment, 10,000 tons of fats, 10,000 tonsof meat and 8,000 tons of dried vegetables.(c) Unfavourable circumstances will not permit the sale in France of the quantities of grain foreseen and we shall find ourselves obliged to import 240,000 tons of corn (this does not include the quantities ofcorn which the Supreme Commander continues to import in the southof France). We ask you if all or part of this corn cannot be delivered by Great Britain.
(d) French needs are particularly acute in steel, paper and paper-pulp andwe wish to know the possibilities of immediate purchase in GreatBritain of these products.(e) Within the general framework of negotiations regarding the allocations of tonnage necessary to France for the execution of the import pro-grammes approved by the Allied Governments, discussions are atthe moment taking place with the Ministry of War Transport inorder to obtain 350,000 tons of cargoes regarded as indispensable forthe transport to Metropolitan France of the products of the French Empire provided for in the programme. The immediate obtainingof this tonnage is the more necessary since not only MetropolitanFrance has urgent need of the products of the French Empire whichare intended for it, such as fats, but also since a part of thisproduction is in danger of being lost on account of the delays in itslifting.At the conclusion of the review made by M. Alphand, Mr. Richard Law was so good as to state that he would inform the Cabinet of our requests. I am well aware how much you and your colleagues must be preoccupied by the economicsituation which exists in Western Europe, and particularly in France, by thedevelopment of the war, and I am sure that the British Government, as the PrimeMinister has stated, will be careful to do everything possible in order to avoid the very serious consequences which the prolongation of such a state of affairsmight produce.I take this opportunity, &amp;c.MASSIGLI. &apos;



Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 160.10th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR four weeks ENDING 25th FEBRUARY, 1945.A. A detailed summary of operations is appended.B. Results of Operations.1. Oil Targets.Successful attacks were made on a number of oil plants during the period.Photographs show that in an attack on the oil refinery at Rositz on the14th/ 15th February a cooling tower and oil storage tanks in the south-east partof the plant were severely damaged and the stores yard destroyed. As itappeared from photographic cover at the beginning of February that the synthetic oil plant at Wanne-Eickel was about to restart production up to 50 per cent, of capacity, it was attacked three times during the period. Photographs taken theday after the attack on the Monheim oil refinery snowed a large group of oil tanksstill burning and on later photographs it could be seen that of some fifteen largeoil tanks only four remained. In addition the boiler house and processing unitswere damaged.The Reisholz oil refinery was severely damaged on the 20th/21st February,and the plant will be out of action until the boiler house, which was destroyed inthis attack, is repaired, which should take one or two months. Photographs takenshortly after the attacks on the benzol plants at Osterfeld and Scholven showedmany fires still burning in both plants, but the exact extent of the damage cannotbe assessed until further photographs are obtained.It is estimated that, as a result of the heavy damage caused in the attacks onthe Hansa (Dortmund) benzol plant, production will have stopped for at least a month. The Nordstern and Alma Pluto (both at Gelsenkirchen), Prosper(Bottrop) benzol plants and the synthetic oil plants at Bohlen and Karnen were also attacked.Photographic cover obtained on the 3rd March of Politz, attacked on the night of the 8th February, showed tremendous damage throughout the plant. Itis estimated that it will be out of action for at least two to three months, and at thetime the photographs were taken there were no signs of repairs being carried out.2. German Towns.Two heavy attacks were made on the 13th/14th February on Dresden, thelargest city in Germany that had not been heavily bombed. Photographs obtained on the 15th February cover only part of the city on both banks of the River Elbe,but show that the area is almost completely devastated. It is expected that laterphotographs will confirm the tremendous damage throughout the whole townreferred to in the German and neutral press. Print No. 1 shows the very heavy damage inflicted on Wiesbaden. Many industrial works and public buildings, including the gas works, the town hall and the post office, were severely damaged. Worms, a communication centre of great importance behind thewestern front, was heavily attacked, and the main town and southern industrial areas suffered severe damage.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.[29404]
