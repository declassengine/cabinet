Enemy Intelligence.. 11. Reconnaissance of Gdynia on the 4th located the lutzow, Scheer,Leipzig, Gneisenau, an old battleship and four destroyers. The three 11&quot;guns had been removed from the Scheer, Leipzig is reported to be inactive,Gneisenau remains dismantled and only lutzow would appear to be operational.It is reported that a German minesweeper foundered in heavy weather in theKattegat on the 1st, with heavy loss of life.U-boats.12. Activity, particularly in the St. George&apos;s Channel, continues&apos; in home waters, but elsewhere the situation is quiet. It is estimated that approximatelytwice as many U-boats were at sea during the first week of March as duringthe corresponding week in February. Reconnaissance of Kiel on the 2ndshowed at least 73 U-boats, including 23 of the new types. Reconnaissance ofWilhelmshaven on the same day showed 99 midget U-boats.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13, Two ships in a homeward-bound convoy from Canada were torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat in the St. George&apos;s Channel and a ship in coastal convoy was torpedoed off Milford Haven and beached. A US. ship in convoy was mined and sunk off Ostend.A ship sailing independently from Trinidad to Capetown was reported thisweek to have been torpedoed and sunk in the South Atlantic on the 23rd February.14. Provisional shipping losses by enemy action and marine causes during february were 31 ships of 111,738 tons.Allied Minelaying. .15. Surface craft have laid a large number of mines in Home Waters,Aircraft laid mines in the Kattegat, Skagerrak and Baltic, in the approaches to Oslo and Kiel and in the Heligoland Bight.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.16.   Eight mines have been destroyed off Ostend during the week.Dangerous areas have been declared off Cherbourg and Le Treport where a- number of mines have been sighted by aircraft.In the Mediterranean 16 mines have been destroyed in the Gulf of Patras,and 70 in the Thermia Channel between Zea and Thermia (^aegean).The mine totals are 6,420 ground and 8,995 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.17. During the fortnight ending the &quot;3rd, another 100,000 tons of transportsare estimated to have reached Denmark from Southern Norway.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.18. During the period there has been little to report from the SouthernSector. .The Third U.S. Army has made considerable progress in the Eifel. Trierhas been captured and US. armour has broken through N.E. of Bitburg. FirstU.S. Army troops have entered Cologne. Further north the Ninth US. Armyoffensive has met with outstanding success; Neuss, Munchen-Gladbach, Krefeldand Kempen have fallen, and the line of the River Rhine has been reached fron?Neuss to north of Homburg.The First Canadian Army has continued to press the enemy back between thtMaas and the Rhine against stiff resistance; the enemy now possesses only onebridgehead west of the Rhine in this area.[29392] B
Southern Sector.19. On the First French Army front operations have been confined to patrolactivity.The Seventh U.S. Army has continued to maintain steady pressure in theSaarbrucken Sector, capturing Forbach on the 6th.Central Sector.20. In the Eifel, the Third U.S. Army has made steady gains and by the2nd, had closed up to the River Kyll on a 15-mile front north and south ofBitburg. On &quot;the 3rd, a bridgehead across the Kyll east of Bitburg was seizedand on the same day U.S. troops advancing S.E. reached the Moselle at Trier,linking up with other U.S. forces which had entered Trier from the south onthe 2nd. On the 5th, a U.S. armoured column broke through the enemy defencesnorth of Bitburg and had advanced, by the 6th,, to within 25 miles of the Rhineat Ulmen.  The Rhine north of Coblenz was reached on the 7th.Having secured, bridgeheads across the Erft south of Bedburg on the 28th,the First U.S. Army was engaged in hard fighting for the control of the high ground in this area. After overcoming this opposition U.S. troops on the 2nd,began to&apos; push eastwards towards Cologne, penetrating the outskirts of the cityon the 5th. By the next day, the greater part of Cologne was in our hands, andthe Rhine had been reached by the First U.S. Army at three points betweenCologne and Dusseldorf.On the 7th, an armoured column pushing S.E. from Euskirchen, reached the rhine at Remagen.Northern Sector.21. The progress of the Ninth U.S. Army has been sensational. taking advantage of the confusion caused by the initial attack, strong armoured forcesadvanced on Krefeld, Viersen and Kempen. By the 2nd, complete success hadbeen achieved; Neuss, Munchen-Gladbach, Krefeld and.Kempen had fallen, andan armoured formation was pushed rapidly northward towards Geldern where,on the following day, a junction with troops of the First Canadian Army was effected. The Ninth U.S. Army then swung eastwards towards the Rhine. Bythe 5th, all organised enemy resistance west of the Rhine between Neuss and Orsoy that is on the entire Army front had ceased.Meanwhile, the First Canadian Army, by maintaining steady pressurebetween the Maas and the Rhine, had drawn off the bulk of the enemy reserves.With the enemy strongly contesting every advance, the Hochwald Forest was cleared by the 4th. Fighting is still in progress in the outskirts of Xanten.Similar very bitter fighting continued on the right of the Army front, whereWeeze was captured on the 2nd. On the 3rd, however, the enemy began to pullback in this area and British troops were able to advance to join the Americansat Geldern. Thereafter the enemy was pressed eastwards towards Wesel where he now holds a bridgehead 8 miles wide and 6 miles deep. This bridgehead, withthe help of the U.S. troops on its southern flank, is being steadily compressed toan even smaller area, in spite of desperate enemy resistance.Russian Front.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Latvia.22. Heavy fighting is reported by the Germans in the areas S.E. of Libauand further to the east.   The Russians have put out no claim.East Prussia. , -23. Although strong Russian attacks in the area S.W. of Koenigsberg have achieved no break-through, the size of the German pocket has been reduced to an area about 35 miles long and 8-12 miles deep. Small German attacks in theSamland peninsula to the N.W. of Koenigsberg have made no further progress.Central Sector.24. The main feature on the Eastern Front this week has been the doublebreak-through by the Russian Army Groups under Marshal Zhukov and MarshalRokossovskyto the Baltic Coast.
These two thrusts, which began during the last days of February, reachedthe coast on the 4th, capturing Koslin on that day. Subsequent advances havebroadened the salient to the east and west and the Russians now virtually controlan 80-mile stretch of the Baltic coast, with the exception of the port of Kolberg,which is still holding out. The Russians are within 14 miles of the great port of Stettin and up to the eastern shore of the &quot;Haff&quot; (the lagoon north ofStettin).In the rear of this sector, the fortress town of Graudenz was taken on the6th, after a fortnights siege. East of Marshal Rokossovsky&apos;s break-through, theRussians have also made some progress in the area west of Marienburg.Elsewhere on the Central Sector there have been no great changes in theline, but the Germans report heavy Russian attacks north of Frankfurt and on both sides of Kuestrin, aimed at creating starting points for further operations on the west bank of the river.   . -Southern Sector.25. In Southern Hungary, the front between the Rivers Danube and Drava,which has recently been relatively quiet, flared up on the 6th; the Russiansreported German attacks with strong forces of tanks and infantry in the areas to the N.E. and south of Lake Balaton.Italy.26. On the extreme right of the Eighth Army front, Italian forces have captured a village east of Lake Comacchio and taken some 200 prisoners.On the Fifth Army front, the second phase of the operations west of theBologna-Pistoia road has been completed by U.S. and Brazilian troops, .who havenow advanced 4 or 5 miles on a narrow front, and captured more than 1,000prisoners.Elsewhere there has been minor activity only.Burma.27. On the coast of Burma our troops from the Ruywa bridgehead have occupied the village of Tamandu and linked up with other troops advancing fromthe north.In Central Burma motorised forces with armoured support, broke out fromthe Nyaungu bridgehead on the 20th, and reached Taungtha, where they capturedan enemy supply dump and killed 400 on the 24th. Three airfields 8 to 10 miles .W. of Meiktila were taken on the 26th, and the following day reinforcementsbegan to fly-in to one of them. Meiktila itself was entered the following day and fighting is now in progress to mop up enemy remnants in the town. Patrolshave -reached Thazi on the main railway and 18 miles down the Meiktila-Pyawbwe road.On the 24th/25th, British troops established a bridgehead across theIrrawaddy in the Ngazun area. Fighting has been heavy both here and in theadjacent bridgehead opposite Myinmu. Operations are in progress to link thetwo bridgeheads up.Advancing from the Kyaukmyaung area, Indian troops have made good progress towards Madaya. One column is 5 miles to the east of the village and leading troops from the north are reported to have reached its outskirts.In Northern Burma, British troops have made good progress towards MongMit. One column is now some 8 miles to the west whilst another is only 10 miles to the N.W.   Chinese troops have occupied Lashio.Pacific.Philippines.28. Luzon. Small mopping-up operations have continued in isolatedbuildings in Manila.South of Manila, U.S. forces have made progress east and S.E. particularlyalong the western shore of the Laguna de Bay, the large lake south of Manila,where 2,146 internees have been liberated from a camp on the southern shores ofthe lake.[29392J B 2
Organised Japanese resistance on Corregidor has now ceased, after some ofthe bitterest fighting of the entire campaign. The last major action took place onthe night 23rd-24th, when some 200 Japanese blasted their way out of a tunnelwhere they had been sealed up by TJ.S. troops.U.S. forces have landed on a number of small islands (including Lubang,Burias and Ticao) on the sea route between Manila and Leyte. No serious opposition is reported.U.S. forces have also landed on the 28th at Puerto Princessa on Palawan, the fifth largest island of the Philippines, which lies 150 miles S.W. of Mindoro.They have seized the town and airfields without serious opposition and have now reached the opposite coast of the island.Kazan Islands.29. Iwo Jima. U.S. Marines have made small advances against very strongJapanese opposition.On the 4th, the Japanese launched a large-scale counter-attack in the westernsector. This was repulsed and on the 6th the Marines resumed the offensive afterthe heaviest artillery bombardment of the campaign.Japanese casualties to the 5th amount to 14,456 killed.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.30. On two nights of the week enemy aircraft operated over East Anglia,Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. On one night approximately 70 aircraft cameoverland, of which 6 were destroyed. Twenty-two heavy bombers of bomber command crashed at home bases as a result of action by these intruders.Fighter Command flew 196 sorties against enemy aircraft and against flying-bombs, launched against this country; details of these and of rocket incidentsare reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and Home Security,&quot; while attacks on long-range rockets are&quot; reported in paragraph 32.Home Waters.31.

One hundred and fifty enemy aircraft were destroyed and 97 damaged; 218 Allied aircraft are missing, but some may havelanded on the Continent. Transport aircraft flew 576 sorties carrying supplies to the Continent.Heavy bombers continued attacks against many railway and industrial centres in Germany, some 19,000 tons being released. The principal objectives were railway centres at Cologne (2,801 tons), Ulm (1,448 tons), Chemnitz(1,391 tons), and Dresden (964 tons); and industrial targets at Mannheim(2,039 tons), Dessau (1,706 tons) and Ulm (587 tons).Over 8,400 tons were dropped on a number of oil plants, including Kamen(1,356 tons), Magdeburg (1,093 tons), Gelsenkirchen (793 tons), Bohlen (990 tons),Hemmingstedt (2 miles S. of Heide 724 tons), and Harburg (1,021 tons).In most cases cloud prevented the observation of results of the operationsreferred to above, but in some instances, notably at Bohlen, Chemnitz and Dessau,large fires could be seen.In the course of their daylight attack on Krupps tank factory at Magdeburgand the synthetic oil plant at Bohlen, a force of 1,100 heavies encountered about
130 enemy aircraft of which 67 were destroyed in combat; and a further36 were destroyed on the ground. Further opposition was met with over Dessauwhere at least 14 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Berlin was again attacked by Mosquitoes on each night of the week, andSpitfires continued successful operations against rocket sites in Holland.Over 1,000 tons were released at night on the Dortmund-Ems Canal atLadbergen (including 18 bombs of 12,000 lbs.). Photographs show that the westernchannel is obliterated over a distance of half a mile, in addition to considerableJ      other damage.Other targets included Sassnitz (S.W. Baltic) where naval installations and shipping were bombed by aircraft of Bomber Command (670 tons). Cloudprevented the observation of results but fires were reported in the dock area, anda vessel (believed to be a destroyer) was left burning.Aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) continued to provide close support for land forces. Bombers attacked a variety of targets, chiefly communications, but cloudfrequently prevented the observation of results. Fighters and fighter-bombersoperated on all sectors despite bad weather conditions on some days; 320 loco-motives, 3,700 railway wagons, 1,370 M.T. and 200 A.F.V. were destroyed or damaged, while railways were cut in over 400 places.There was an increase in the activity of the G.A.F., and on the 2nd it isbelieved that some 300/350 tactical sorties were flown.Note.

German attacks against this country during the week have been in three forms. Long-range rocket attacks have continued; flying-bombs,apparently launched from land bases probably in Holland, have reappeared and operations by piloted aircraft have been on a greater scale than since before D-day.(a) Long-range Rockets. The total number of incidents reported was 66,of which 46 took place in the London area; one borough recorded as many as8 incidents.(b) Flying-bombs. Attacks were resumed early on Saturday morning and continued spasmodically during daylight and darkness, for the remainder of the
week. They were on a small scale and about 60 per cent, of the bombs werefitted with radio apparatus.A total of 43 were plotted; of which 15 were destroyed. Of 17 land incidentsreported, 7 were in London, 5 in Essex, 3 in Hertfordshire and one each in Surreyand Kent.(c) Piloted Aircraft. The attacks by aircraft took the form of intruderactivity against our bombers. The German aircraft ranged over a wide area,incidents being reported from Matlock and Banbury as well as throughout east anglia; most of the incidents were of a minor nature caused by machine gunand cannon fire, but some H.E., anti-personnel and incendiary bombs were dropped.Damage.40. Some degree of damage was caused at 12 key points, but in only one case was production seriously affected, when a flying-bomb fell at Barking power station.Casualties.41.

APPENDIX YII.Allied Air Attacks.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.As chaff enburg Marshalling Yard. Photographs taken on the 2nd Marchshow that, as a result of the 8th Air Force attack on the 25th February, very heavy concentrations of craters have disrupted the reception, sorting, and holding sidings. Both engine repair shops and the main station have been almost completely gutted. One turntable has received a direct hit, and at least one of the three rail-over-road bridges has been cut. There is destruction of wagons and coaches throughout the yard and to the north and south damage has been caused to at least three industrial premises.Bremen. Photographs taken on the 2nd and 3rd March, and covering thesouth three-quarters of the target area show that, as a result of the 8th AirForce attack on the 24th February and several small attacks by Bomber Commandduring the same month, damage is concentrated in the central part of theDeschimag shipyard, involving the pump house, the boiler smithy, an engineeringshop, a boiler house and several other buildings. The 8th Air Force attack onthe 24th February is seen, on the same cover, to have destroyed a 60-ft. spanat the southern end of the west rail bridge.Cologne. Photographs taken on the 2nd March, after the Bomber command attack on the same day, show many new points of damage throughout the already devastated central city area. At other points, craters and fallen debrishave blocked the roads. The Deutz bridge (the Cologne road bridge) has been destroyed throughout its length, blocking the river, and direct hits have caused the structure at the western end of the Hohenzollern road and rail bridge tocollapse, blocking the entry. Severe new damage has been caused to the Colognemain station buildings and to trans-shipment sheds in the Gereon marshalling yards. Many reconstructed buildings in the city have been hit and amongstindustrial property affected are the cotton mills of Koehler Baumwoll-Spinnerei.Crailsheim Railway Centre. Photographs taken on the 27th February showthat, as a result of the 8th Air Force attack on the 23rd, a heavy cqncentrationof craters was caused from the vicinity of the passenger station to the southernrail over road bridge. All rail lines have been cut in many places and several buildings at the passenger station and in the east and west goods depots havebeen- destroyed or severely damaged. West of the railway centre, four large and one medium barracks buildings have been destroyed.Gelsenkirchen. Photographs taken on the 3rd March show that, as a resultof the Bomber Command attack on the 27th February, the Alma-Pluto cokingplant of the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerke has been, severely damaged. practically all identified installations have been hit including the Exhauster house, theSulphate house and the crude Benzol plant: It is considered that the plant will beinoperative for three or four weeks.Heilbronn (railway centre).
