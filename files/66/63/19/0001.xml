Printed for the War Cabinet.  March 1945.the mrsm&amp;l us-TOP secret.P. (45) 164.\Ath March, 1945.WAR CABINET.POLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State, for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a brief preliminary telegraphicreport in the form of questions and answers upon conditions in Poland, whichhas been received from the small party of British officers who were dropped intoPoland early this year to act as liaison officers with the Polish UndergroundMovement. These officers were overrun by the Russian advance through Polandalmost immediately after their arrival and were then escorted to Moscow whencethe attached report was received.Foreign Office, 14th March, 1945.Q. What do you consider will be the general reaction to the Three-Poweragreement on Poland ?A . The Russians are widely distrusted, but the Poles feel there is no alterna-tive. It is generally felt that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment are in no position to help. Much of the intellectual class will stand aside until Russian intentions can be judged.Q. Have you any evidence of intention of the A.K. (Home Army) to continue in existence in conspiracy under Soviet occupation?A. The popular appeal exercised by the A.K. during the German occupa-tion no longer exists. Many of the officers will remain in conspiracy until Sovietintentions are defined.Q,. Apart from the A.K. are there other groups who might continueexistence in conspiracy?A. The N.S.Z. (independent right-wing Nationalist underground forces),who have collaborated with Germans in the past, will try to work against theRussians conspiratorially.   They are not important.Q. Will the underground leaders join a reconstituted provisional Govern-ment enjoying recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States?A. The prestige of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States willbe instrumental in the early stages only in influencing many Poles of non-(two groups undecypherable) to co-operate more freely with the Provisional Govern-ment. The inclusion of Mikolajczyk or other members of London Governmentwill tend to have the same effect. Later, however, Polish co-operation will dependon the amount of freedom the Poles feel they are allowed by the Russians.Q.   Have you any evidence of Russian treatment of A.K. officers and personnel?  Was this exceptionally bad even according to Russian standards?A.   Our evidence of this is scanty and inconclusive.Q.   In what respect was your own treatment bad ?A.   Details follow by bag.A. E.12702   [29429]
