(45) 153.9th March, 1945WAR CABINET.DISCLOSURE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION INTHE DEFENCE FIELD TO OTHER COUNTRIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Production and the Paymaster-General.IN his minute M. 151/5 the Prime Minister laid it down that no disclosuresof secret inventions or devices used in the Services should be made to the Frenchor any of the Allies other than the Americans, pending consideration of the policy by a Committee of Ministers to be convened by the Minister of Production on the invitation of the Radio Board.2. Since the date of the Prime Ministers minute the Lord President has put forward proposals to establish official machinery for considering andfocussing for Ministerial decision the issues which arise over the whole field of scientific co-operation with other countries from now onwards. This is a very wide subject in which it is often difficult to disentangle the defence from the civilian and commercial aspects. The Lord Presidents proposals are shortly tocome before his Committee and, if approved, will provide a means of working out our long-term policy.3. In the meantime we and the Americans are faced by a formal request from the French to send a Mission to this country and to the United States to survey the field of aeronautical production and development with a view to (a) the technical collaboration of the French Aircraft Industry with thatof Great Britain and of America; and(b) the purchase of equipment and licences to manufacture.It is understood that the Mission want to discuss and examine the most up-to-date equipment, particularly-*(a) the most powerful engines and propellers;(b) jet propulsion aircraft;(c) remote control firing equipment;(a) radar equipment; &apos;(e) armament; and(/) pilotless aircraft.It is understood also that the State Department are in favour of the generalproposition of holding technical discussions with the French and that our willing-ness to receive a Mission for this purpose was conveyed informally to the Frenchbefore we received their formal request.4. At the moment S.C.A.E.F. has been instructed by the Combined Chiefsof Staff not ,to permit the Mission to leave France pending combined agreement on the policy to be adopted in dealing with them. This is not a position that canbe held for long : the French are becoming restive and it is necessary that, withthe least possible delay, we should (a) define our own attitude; and(b) reach agreement if possible with the Americans.[29396]
25. In our view we are not justified at the present time in being too forth-coming to the French, for the following reasons : (a) it is unlikely that the German War will last long enough for Frenchproduction to have any appreciable importance, and we do not yetknow whether they propose to take part in the Japanese War;(&amp;) we have no indication whether France intends to make a long-termmilitary alliance with us or not, or, alternatively, what contributionsshe will be called upon to make in the World Security Organisation;(c) their security arrangements are not satisfactory; and\d) they may well pass the information onto third parties, e.g., the Russians,to whom we have refused some of the information the French are nowasking for.6. Whatever information we give to the French we shall be pressed togive to other Allies. It must be remembered also that a great deal of theinformation for which the French are asking has a considerable post-warcommercial value.7. We must ask, therefore, for guidance upon how far we should now go withthe French, for instance, whether devices which cannot come into production for the war against Germany, should be disclosed and whether the latest types of aircraft now in quantity production should be supplied and licences to manu-facture conceded..It is worth pointing out that these concessions are valuable cards in ourhand in any negotiations for a military alliance.8. The Chiefs of Staff have considered the matter and have formulated theirviews on the line to be taken with the French. These are set out in a telegram to the Joint Staff Mission, the contents of which have not yet been communicatedto the Americans. A copy of the telegram is annexed and might serve as a basis for discussion by the War Cabinet.O. L.; if: - ... -      ..... im^m-^mm9th March, 1945.ANNEX.Copy of a telegram from A.M.S.S.O. to J.S.M., Washington.(OZ. 1149.)[C.O.S. (W)&apos; 631] Wth February, 1945.Following from Chiefs of Staff : Reference C.O.S. (W.) 625, we have examined the question of how muchinformation we can release to the Ziegler French Air Mission. The following considerations seem to us very important: (a) We must not give the French any information which, if it reached theenemy, would enable him to gain any advantage in the time availableeither by imitation or counter-measure.     ,(&amp;) The task of the Mission is to decide what the Industry will build in thefuture. As these products will not appear for 18 months-2 years, itis not sufficient to let them see only material in current operationaluse.(c) French security is at present: too doubtful to allow us to show themeverything we have in the course-of development or to reveal trendsof scientific thought.(d) It is desirable from economic, political and strategic points of view- that the French should be helped to restart their industry.2. Bearing in mind these considerations, we have decided to ask for UnitedStates Chiefs of Staff agreement to releasing information on all material whichis at present in quantity production with a few exceptions in signals and arma-ment equipment, relating to items which, if they came to the knowledge of theenemy, would materially assist him in his operations.
3.   These exceptions are .:-  .(a) Beech Nut.(&amp;) Oboe.(c) Tuba.(d) Dinah.(e) Jostle IV.(/) Mandrel II.(g) Perfectos.(h) Mark XXIV Mine.4. We do not propose to withhold from the French full information on those Jet aircraft at present in quantity production, i.e., Meteor III. Our reasons are : (a) These aircraft are now operating on Continent and although only.defen-sive over our lines it will probably not be long before one falls intoenemy hands.(&amp;) If we do not show Jets, French will be seriously handicapped in theirplanning, as we know that they are hoping to manufacture aircraft of this type.5. We must assume that any help we give to French in this way we shallnot be able to refuse to Russia and United States Chiefs of Staff may regard this as particularly important in relation to Jet aircraft. However, russian advance into Germany will inevitably give them opportunity of examining GermanJet aircraft and therefore release of information about our aircraft at presentin production would not greatly, add to the knowledge the Russians will get inany case.6. Essential that we reach firm agreement with United States Chiefs ofStaff as to how much we disclose. It will, not matter if our security limitationsdisplease the French so long as we and the Americans present a united front.Unilateral action will however have obvious disadvantages.7. We propose that the definition agreed upon between us and UnitedStates Chiefs of Staff should not be disclosed to the French. If the French askto see items that are not covered by this definition they will be told that the itemsthey are being shown have been agreed by Combined Chiefs of Staff on strategicalgrounds, with a view to disclosure, in the interests of French re-armament, ofthe maximum which military considerations permit.8. Request you put these proposals before United States Chiefs of staff and try to secure their agreement as a matter of urgency.
