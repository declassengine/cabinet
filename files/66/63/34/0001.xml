Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.The- fiirciifatsosioily limitIt ss issued for the personal use of top secret.P.. (45) 179.20th March, 1945.JJWAR CABINET.SHIPPING LOSSES.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.AT its meeting on Friday, the 26th January (W.M. (45) 11th Meeting), theWar Cabinet agreed that an addition of 2 per cent, should be made to theestimated over-all deficiency in sailings during the first six months of 1945 tocover the risks of increased losses by U-Boat action. I was, however, askedto report on this decision at the end of two months or earlier if necessary.Subsequently, at the &quot;Argonaut&quot; Conference, the Combined Chiefs ofStaff decided to make no provision for additional losses by U-Boat activity butto review the situation again on the 1st April, 1945.The question of the 2 per cent, increase does not, therefore, arise at present,but will be considered as part of the general revision referred to in the preceding paragraph. I should mention, however, that losses actually experienced during january and February conformed very closely to the agreed rates upon whichthe 8 per cent, deficiency in dry cargo sailings was calculated in January 1945.So far, therefore, an increase of 2 per cent, beyond the 8 per cent, would nothave been justified.A. V. A.Admiralty, 20th March, 1945.[29473]
