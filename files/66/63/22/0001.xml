THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (45) 167.11 th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY VIEWS OF THE canadian government.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I. Mr. Mackenzie King (in W.P. (45) 142) offers us a generous measure of help post-war.2. Unfortunately it is help on his terms. He does not realise the realproblems which face both Canada and the United Kingdom.3. We do not want (as he thinks) to discriminate against Canada. Farfrom it, in fact we want to buy their wheat and bacon.4. We are willing, indeed anxious, to exchange goods (i.e., promote inter-national trade) with any country which is also ready to exchange goods.5. What we cannot do is to buy indiscriminately from any country thatwants to sell to us without regard to how we are going to pay. In the changed circumstances of to-day we cannot hope it will all come out in the wash as it did in the 19th century.6. Mr. Mackenzie King admits the United Kingdom market is of vitalimportance to Canada. This is most significant. Indeed, refreshing. ButCanada is not the only country concerned to secure a steady outlet in the UnitedKingdom for its exports, particularly food and raw materials. This factobviously places us in a very strong position.7. There is nothing wrong in using the facts of the situation to promote ourown export trade, to maintain the full employment of our people and to raisetheir standard of living.8. We should repudiate with vigour any contention that such action canlegitimately be described as &quot; discrimination.&quot;9. Where in my view Mr. Mackenzie King errs is in refusing to face upto the fact that Canada has become a creditor nation and the United kingdom debtor. His telegram confirms the belief expressed to me in Ottawa by officialsthat Canada can continue in the future as she did pre-war to export largequantities of food and raw materials to the United Kingdom and import thebulk of her requirements of manufactured goods from the United States withoutbothering about how we are to get the dollars necessary to pay Canada or alterna-tively how we are to provide her with dollars to pay the United States.10. His proposal to meet the situation by loans or credits is based on theassumption that the problem is a short-term one of the transitional period.II. But it isn&apos;t. It is a long-term problem. A loan merely serves to putoff the evil day unless Canada and/or the United States are prepared to takeimports from non-dollar countries, and particularly to take our manufacturedgoods on a scale far greater than anything they appear to be contemplating atpresent.[29435]
12. We too must face up to realities of changed situation. We cannotimport indiscriminately and trust to luck that markets for our exports will beavailable somehow, somewhere.13. We shall only get dollars necessary to pay for our necessary (or anyhowdesirable) imports from dollar countries by taking the fullest possible advantageof the need of those countries to find a market in the United Kingdom.14. We cannot afford to throw away the powerful weapon we possess in our willingness to import on an immense scale. We must secure permanent markets for our exports if we are to maintain the standard of living of our people.R. S. H.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1,17th March, 1945.
