[&quot;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 188.23rd March, 1945.WAR CABINET.OUTPUT AND LABOUR IN THE HARD COAL-MINING INDUSTRYIN GREATER GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare,I should like to offer the following comments on the interesting papersubmitted by the Minister of Fuel and Power, W.P. (45) 176.Whilst I accept the conclusion of paragraph 4 that the principal factor in maintaining Germany&apos;s coal output has been the increase in the labour employed, I think we should be reluctant to draw conclusions from the com-parison of German and British output per man-hour referred to in paragraph 5,and set out in Tables III and IV. Other factors beside increasing dilution withforeign workers may have operated to depress German output per man-shift;for instance, no mention is made of bombing, which must have contributed some-thing to the exceptional fall in the Ruhr (over 10 per cent.) between 1942 and1943. In Upper Silesia on the other hand, two-thirds of the total fall (morethan 14 per cent.) occurred between 1939 and 1940, for which year &quot;dilution &quot;statistics are not available, whilst an increased &quot; dilution &quot; of over 10 per cent,between 1942 and 1943 is not accompanied by any striking reduction in man-houroutput such as is to be seen in the Ruhr. Differences in the rations and in theage structure of the respective labour forces must also have operated, not alwaysin the same direction, to invalidate comparison. Whilst output per man-shifthas fallen by more in Germany than in Britain, I do not think that we can drawfrom the fact any firm conclusions about the performance of British coal mining-labour.Similarly it is undoubtedly true, as Table III shows, that German output per man-shift is still substantially higher than British output; but it wouldnot be fair to draw from this fact any adverse conclusion about the performance of British labour without taking into account the technical and other differences between the average conditions of work in the two countries.S.Ministry of Economic Warfare, W.1,23rd March, 1945.Copy No.I
