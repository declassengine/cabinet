H.M. ships Milne and Marne (destroyers) shelled Genoa on the 15th.In the Gulf of Grenoa on the following night the French escort vessel Lansquenetsank an E-boat during an action in which she sustained ten casualties. On the night of the 7th/18th, west of Leghorn, H.M. ships Meteor and Lookout(destroyers) intercepted three enemy destroyers or torpedo boats which had madea sortie from Genoa. Two of the enemy, believed to be the destroyers Eridanoand Arturo (1943 : 1,058 tons) were sunk and survivors were picked up.8. In the Adriatic coastal forces sank five armed lighters on the night of the15th /16th and, two nights later, a lighter escorted by E-boats.Pacific.Northern Pacific.9. On the 16th, U.S. ships bombarded Matsuwa Island in the Kuriles.Enemy return fire from shore batteries was ineffective.Japan.10. On the 18th, US. carrier-borne aircraft in strength attacked airfields onKyushu (S.W. Japan). On the following day the aircraft attacked the JapaneseFleet in its home bases in the Inland Sea. Preliminary reports state that theenemy ships damaged include one or two battleships, two or three aircraft carriers, four escort carriers or light aircraft carriers, two cruisers, four destroyers and a U-boat. Six small cargo ships were sunk and seven cargo ships were damaged. A large number of aircraft were shot down and destroyed on theground. In spite of many attacks on the U.S. force, only one ship was seriously damaged and a few others received minor damage.
Philippines.11. On the 18th U.S. cruisers and destroyers carried out a bombardmentprior to a landing on the southern shore of Panay Island.U.S. P.T. boats operating in the Philippines have sunk a laden sea truck,eight barges, three motor launches and three other craft.At Manila 300 ships have been sunk in the harbour, some by U.S. bombing andothers deliberately as blockships. It is estimated that the pier can be put intoworking order within a few weeks.East Indies.12. HM. ships Saumarez, Volage and Rapid (destroyers) shelled Sigli(N. Sumatra) on the 17th and Port Blair (Andamans) two days later. While inStewart Sound (N. Andamans) Volage and Rapid sustained casualties and slight damage from the fire of shore batteries.; 13. HM. S/Ms. have reported the following from recent patrols : Seascoutin the Malacca Strait sank seven native craft and torpedoed a 300-ton coasterwhich probably sank. Supreme sank four native craft N.E. of Sumatra. Seadogdamaged a coaster off the Andamans.Anti-Submarine Operations.14. Fifty-nine attacks on U-boats were reported during the week : 47 by warships and 12 by shore-based aircraft.H.M.S.A.S. Natal (frigate) probably sank a U-boat on the 14th off St. Abb&apos;sHead, and the U.S.S. Thornhill (destroyer escort) made a promising attack onthe 17th in the North Channel. The U.S.S. Loive (destroyer escort) probably sank a U-boat on the 18th S.E. of Halifax.Enemy Intelligence.15. Photographic reconnaissance on the 15th showed the -koln atWilhelrnshaven.U-boats.16. U-boats at present on patrol in Home Waters include five or six inthe Channel, some in the approaches to the British Channel and St. George&apos;s channel and in the Irish Sea and six round the coast between Oban and Newcastle.Enemy Attack on Shipping.17. During the week seven ships are reported to have been sunk, totalling34,900 tons.U-boats sank one ship and torpedoed another in convoy to North Russia and attacked four in Home Waters. Of the latter, one in an inward convoy fromIceland (C) was sunk off Skye, one U.S. ship was sunk and another Torpedoedin Channel convoys in the western Channel and a ship in a homebound convoy from Antwerp was sunk off Zeebrugge.E-boats sank two ships in an East Coast convoy off Yarmouth.Mines accounted for a ship sunk off Zeebrugge and a U.S. ship damagedoff Ostend in a convoy bound for Antwerp.Allied Minelaying.18. Surface craft have laid a large number of mines in Home Waters.Aircraft have laid mines in the Kattegat and in the Heligoland Bight. Carrier-borne aircraft have laid mines off Norway.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.19.   Minelaying by E-boats took place on two nights off the East Coast.In the approaches to the Scheldt, three groups of E-boats evaded our patrolson the night of the 7th/18th and laid mines in the swept channel on the Ostend-Scheldt route.   Three ships in convoy were mined.In the Mediterranean, minesweeping has taken place off Anzio, in theLeghorn area, in the Adriatic, off Sardinia and in the approaches to the gulf of Patras.   The mine totals are : 6,452 ground and 9,359 moored.[29489] b
Enemy Merchant Shipping.20. Before the Russian advance into eastern Germany it is estimated thatthe merchant shipping of 1,000 tons and over under enemy control located betweenStettin and the Bay of Danzig ports amounted to 675,000 tons, of which 75,000tons were tankers. From reconnaissance reports it is estimated that 418,000 tonsof this shipping (of which 49,000 tons were tankers) sailed to ports west of Stettin,23,000 tons sailed for unknown destinations and 17,000 tons were sunk. Of theunreported tonnage of 217,000 tons it is probable that some 100,000 tons of this figure represents damaged shipping.21. It is estimated that, since the 3rd, transports totalling 54,000 tons havearrived in Denmark from southern Norway. This considerable decrease isattributed to Allied mining and air attacks, sabotage and the transfer of troop-ships to the Baltic. There are now only seven transports, totalling some 32,000tons, available on the southern Norway-Denmark route. The Isar (9,026 tons) was damaged by aircraft while leaving Oslo Fiord on the night of the2nd/3rd February; she returned to Oslo with many casualties and has not beenreported since to have sailed.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.  (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.22. The chief events of the week have taken place on the front of theThird U.S. Army south of the Moselle, where U.S. armoured thrusts have closedthe Rhine as far south as Ludwigshafen and established conduct with the SeventhTJ.S. Army pushing north from Saarbrucken. The enemy has been allowed norespite throughout this sector and armoured columns are sweeping eastwardstowards the remaining stretch of the Rhine between Ludwigshafen and Karlsruhe.On the front of the First TJ.S. Army, the Remagen bridgehead has been steadily expanded and the north-south autobahn has been cut.Regrouping continues in the northern sector.Southern Sector.23. While operations on the front of the First French Army were confined to patrol activity, the remainder of the Sixth Army Group, which for some time has been employed on &quot; offensive defensive &quot; tactics while the northern Rhinelandbattle developed, launched an attack on the 15th along the entire Seventh TJ.S.Army sector between the Rhine and Saarbrucken. The steady gains made fromthe outset rapidly gathered momentum as the enemy fell back to his Siegfrieddefences which were reached and pierced in several places by the 19th; on thefollowing day these were overrun on a wide front between Zweibrucken andSaarbrucken and both towns were captured.Central Sector.24. The destruction of the enemy in the Saar was by no means solelydependent on the success of the Seventh U.S. Army&apos;s frontal attack and thisweek&apos;s operations by the Third U.S. Army were designed to speed up this process.Advancing on the right, in a flanking attack astride the Siegfried Line from theTrier area, and on the left, in a wide enveloping movement across the Mosellewell in rear of the enemy defences and parallel to the Rhine, armoured columns,with infantry following up, made rapid progress and achieved sweeping successes.By the 19th, forces on the right had occupied Saarlautern, Lebach (nine miles to the north-east) and St. Wendel, while on the left, Bad Kreuznach, Bingen andCoblenz were cleared. TJ.S. troops closed up to the Rhine between the lattertwo towns, and linked up with the right-hand force near Oberstein. On the 20tharmoured spearheads occupied Kaiserslautern, Worms and Mainz, and thrusfeastwards to Ludwigshafen, the outskirts of which have been entered.The First U.S. Army has continued further to enlarge and expand theRemagen bridgehead, which is now some 20 miles long and 10 miles in depth, andextends from a point 15 miles downstream from Coblenz to a point due east ofBonn.   Opposition has been strong but shows signs of weakening in the north.
Northern Sector.25. There is little to report from the northern sector, where the week hasbeen occupied in large-scale regrouping.Russian Front.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.26. The Russian attack, launched on the 14th, to the S.W. of Konigsberg,reached the coast of the Frisches Haff the following day and split the Germanpocket in East Prussia in two. Since then, the Russians have made steady progress against stiff resistance and on the 20th captured the large town ofBraunsberg.In the area of Danzig and Gdynia there has been heavy fighting and theRussians are slowly closing in on both ports. They are now within 2 miles of theBaltic between Danzig and Gdynia.Further west, the surrounded Baltic port of Kolberg was finally captured onthe 18th.Central Sector.27. The capture of Altdamm and the resulting elimination of the Germanbridgehead on the east bank of the River Oder near Stettin has brought theRussians to within 3-4 miles of the latter town. With the exception of a smallGerman bridgehead just north of Frankfurt, the whole of the east bank of theRiver Oder is now in Russian hands.The Germans continue to report heavy fighting in Upper Silesia and the bringing up of further Russian forces. The Russians have made considerable progress between Neisse and Ratibor.Southern Sector.28. In the area between Lake Balaton and the River Danube the initiativeis now with the Russians, although once again they have reported only localfighting. German admissions show that their attack, reinforced by some of the divisions of the 6th Panzer Army, has now been halted and the Russians haveapparently made considerable progress in the direction of Gyor.In Southern Hungary, Russian and Bulgarian pressure has forced theGermans to abandon one of their two bridgeheads across the River Drava fromYugoslavia.Burma.29. The Letpan bridgehead, in the Arakan, has been extended. A columnhas advanced southwards to a point only 13 miles north of Taungup.In Central Burma our troops in the Meiktila area have been reinforced.They have concentrated in a circle, six miles in diameter, and from this strong-hold are continuing their armoured forays.Japanese resistance north of Chauk has continued, although our troops havemade further slight progress towards that village.Mandalay fell to our troops on the 20th. A further encircling move southof Mandalay has nearly been completed; troops advancing from Maymyo andothers from the Tada-U area are only a mile apart in the area eight miles east of Tada-U.In northern Burma, Mogok was captured by British troops on the 21st.Chinese troops took Hsipaw on the 17th. Fighting is in progress on the roadEsipaw-Lashio some twenty-five miles S.W. of the latter town.Philippines.Luzon.30.   No major developments have taken place during the week.Panay.31.   On the 18th, US. troops landed unopposed at Tigbauan on PanayIsland; they quickly thrust inland and on the 18th captured the city and harbour[29489] &apos; b 2
of Iloilo. The Japanese had destroyed the greater part of the city, but theimportant dock and harbour areas were captured intact. Except for minorpockets of Japanese, ail resistance on the island is reported to have been crushed.Other Islands.32. U.S. forces have landed on Romblon and Simara Islands in theSibuyan Sea to the south of Luzon thereby increasing their control over the sea communications to Manila.Iwojima.33. It is reported that organised resistance ceased on the evening of the16th when the U.S. Marines drove through the enemy&quot; lines and reached thenorthern tip of the island. U.S. losses are given as 4,189 killed, 15,388 wounded and 442 missing, while 20,000 Japanese are reported killed in 24 days&apos; fighting.AIR SITUATION,Europe.United Kingdom.34. On three nights of the week small forces of enemy aircraft carried outintruder operations over East Anglia and Yorkshire. One enemy aircraft was destroyed.Fighter Command flew 230 defensive sorties, including 102 against flyin bombs; details of these and of rocket incidents are reported under &quot; enemy activity and Flome Security,&quot; while attacks on rocket installations and communications are reported in paragraph 36.Home Waters.35. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 894 sorties; one aircraft is missing.In attacks on shipping off Norway, by Halifaxes and Mosquitoes, two ships of 4,000 and 5,000 tons were damaged and 6 ships totalling 19,000 tons were lefton fire.Aircraft of Bomber Command laid 167 sea-mines.Western Europe.36. During the week ended dawn on the 22nd, aircraft of Bomber command and U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew 12,298 sorties and dropped 30,345 tons.U.S. VIII Fighter Command and Fighter Command flew 4,050 and 2,087 sorties respectively. In the week ended dawn on the 21st, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air)flew 28,645 sorties and dropped 14,753 tons. One hundred and sixty enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and 143 on the ground. Of 336 Allied aircraft which are missing, 143 are heavy bombers.A feature of the week was the destruction of large numbers of enemytransport of all kinds in and behind the battle areas.Heavy bombers operated in strength, by day, against a variety of targetsover a wide area, in the main against railway centres, oil plants and industrial targets. A fair proportion of the attacks was carried out visually with excellent results.A force of over 1,200 Fortresses and Liberators made a concentrated attackon two railway centres and two tank plants at Berlin. About 2,700 tons (ofwhich approximately half were incendiaries) were dropped, through cloud.Results reported were good. Of some 50 enemy fighters encountered in the area21 were destroyed. East of Berlin several groups of the escort patrolled with aircraft of the Russian Air Force.Over 10,000 tons were dropped on 16 other important railway centres and towns, including concentrated night attacks on Hanau (1,184 tons), Nuremberg(1,114 tons), Wurzburg (970 tons), Witten (961 tons) and Hagen (936 tons); andby day on Oranienburg (1,505 tons), Hamm (462 tons) and Fulda (157 tons). Thedevastation of Hanau, Wurzburg and Witten was almost completed; at the othernamed targets extensive damage and fires were caused.
Attacks on benzol and synthetic oil plants were continued, by day and night,over 7,600 tons being dropped on 16 plants in concentrated attacks. The heaviesttonnage was dropped on Misburg (1,034 tons) by night in clear weather. reconstruction-naissance photographs taken after a raid on the benzol plant at Huls (429 tons)show extensive damage and no obvious activity. The synthetic oil refinery atRuhland (north of Dresden 816 tons) was twice attacked by aircraft based bothin the United Kingdom and Italy.In attacks on industrial objectives approximately 2,000 tons were dropped on 5 targets, among which were the Zeiss optical works at Jena (2 attacks 699 tons), 2 tank plants (659 tons) and a chemical works at Bitterfeld (339 tons).The attacks were generally through cloud and haze. At Jena heavy damage was caused.Three aircraft component and assembly factories in Southern Germany were attacked and 682 tons were dropped visually with good results. In successful attacks on 11 airfields between Bremen and Munster over 2,500 tons were dropped and 46 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.The port area and U-boat yards at Hamburg (775 tons) were attacked, anda heavy daylight attack was made against the German Army H.Q. at Zossen(south of Berlin 1,200 tons) which was successful and unopposed. Small forcesof Lancasters made attacks by day on three railway viaducts and two railway bridges in the continuance of rail destruction. Two spans of the railway viaductat Arnsberg (south-east of the Ruhr) were completely destroyed when 123 tons(including 6 x 22,000 lbs.) were dropped.Nightly sorties were made by Mosquitoes to Berlin (412 tons including139 x 4,000 lbs.) and to 18 other cities in Germany.Over the whole of the Western Front aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) carriedout strong attacks by night and day, with little or no opposition by enemy aircraft, against communications, airfields, troop movements, supply dumps andthree enemy headquarters. Considerable numbers of enemy vehicles were destroyed. Medium bombers flew 6,050 sorties and dropped 7,760 tons on rail and communication centres with excellent results. Over 6,900 M.T., 460 A.F.V.,6,400 railway vehicles and 550 locomotives are reported as destroyed and numbers in excess of these damaged. Railways and roads were cut in 1,230 places. Fifty-seven enemy &quot;aircraft were destroyed in combat and 93 on the ground.Long-range rocket installations and their rail communications in Hollandwere attacked successfully by aircraft of Fighter Command. Over 210 tons of bombs were dropped and railways were cut in 90 places.The activities of the G.A.F. were confined to tactical fighters carrying out(in strengths of 300/325 sorties on some days) free-lance patrols mainly behind the central and southern sectors of the battle area, and against the Remagen area(50/100 sorties). Some 50/75 sorties were flown by night fighters againstBomber Command night attacks.Note. Appendix VII gives Raid Assessments.Southern Europe.37. In the week ended dusk on the 19th, aircraft of M.A.A.F. flew 14,081sorties (including 4,346 by heavy bombers) and dropped 12,026 tons of bombs.Forty-three enemy aircraft were destroyed.

The attacks were chiefly carried out visuallywith good to excellent results. Photographic reconnaissance of the attack on the oil refinery at Szony (215 tons) shows the destruction of several large oil con-tainers and oil fires spreading. Photographs taken after the attack on Komaronrail centre (near Lake Balaton 172 tons) show all rail traffic to Gyor and towards Budapest halted. Lightnings in attacks on bridges badly damaged therailway bridge at Ptuj (north of Zagreb) and Liberators successfully attacked the shipyards and other targets at Monfalcone (north-west of Trieste 230 tons).The aircraft works were heavily damaged, one submarine was sunk, and twofloating docks damaged.Escorting aircraft destroyed over 60 locomotives, and in the attack onKomaron (and other targets) destroyed in the Gyor area 18 out of 34 enemy aircraft operating against aircraft of the Russian Air Force.The Tactical Air Force continued attacks by day and night against road,rail and river communications in the Po Valley and North Italy.

Excellent results were obtained by Liberators which bombed the railway centre at Shikhiachwang (165 miles S.W. of Peiping), causing many fires.Successful attacks were made against communications in the Yellow Riverarea and against shipping off the coast; off Swatow a large tanker and a destroyer were sunk and another destroyer set on fire.In French Indo-China Allied aircraft operated against communications;extensive damage was caused at Hanoi and several bridges were destroyed or damaged. Shipping was attacked off Tourane and in Tongking Gulf, severalvessels being hit and probably sunk.Japan.41. Attacks were made by Super Fortresses on Osaka and Kobe urban andindustrial areas. At Osaka 275 aircraft dropped 1,965 tons of bombs; causingfires visible 60 miles away. At Kobe results were excellent, 308 aircraft releasing2,035 tons of incendiaries which caused extensive fires and heavy explosions.Four Super Fortresses are missing.Pacific.42. In Formosa Liberators successfully bombed a hydro-electric plant atShinka (155 tons) and several airfields (586&apos; tons), while thunderbolts obtaineddirect hits on another electric plant at Takao. Liberators also dropped 229 tonsin two atacks on the naval base at Mako (Pescadores), where many hits were obtained and explosions and fires caused.

Two bridges were destroyed and two fuel dumps set on fire at Palau inthe Carolines, and the airfield at Yap was twice bombed.ENEMY ACTIVITY AND HOME SECURITY.General.43. During the past week the enemy has continued his attacks on thiscountry with flying bombs, piloted aircraft and long-range rockets.(a) Flying Bombs. Activity occurred spasmodically, all the attacks wereshort, and the number of bombs operating in each of the attacks wassmall. Of the 7 incidents recorded none were serious and all wereoutside the London area.(b) Aircraft.-A small number operated on 3 nights of the week, beingengaged primarily in intruder activity. Incidents were scattered overa wide area of Eastern England and, with the exception of Hull wherethere were 12 killed, damage and casualties were not serious.(c) Long-Range Rockets. There were 59 incidents of which 23 occurred inthe London area.Damage.44. Damage on the whole was not serious, and business and residential property was mainly affected; a hospital and a factory suffered considerable damage, while other factories incurred slight damage.Casualties.45.
