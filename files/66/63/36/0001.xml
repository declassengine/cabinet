UNITED   STATES   AGREEMENT   with southern  IRELAND.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.I circulate herewith the telegrams which I have exchanged with the president on this matter. I think it better to let the correspondence drop now. The matter has not attracted much attention here. We are certainly not likely to obtainany redress from correspondence with the State Department. There is no doubtthat very deep feelings were stirred in the United States high circles by the waythe Aviation Conference ended.2. If there is any desire for the matter to be discussed in Cabinet I hopemy colleagues will let Sir Edward Bridges know.W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,20th March, 1945.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT(i)Copy of a Telegram, No. 904, dated 6th March, 1945, from the Prime Ministerto President Roosevelt.(Personal and Top Secret.)On 27th January I sent you my telegram 897 about the Aviation Agreementwith the Government of Southern Ireland. You could not at the time replybecause of wireless silence. At Yalta, and also later at Alexandria, I under-stood from you that you did not approve this step and that it had been taken without your agreement. Mr. Stettinius also made this clear so far as he was concerned. At the same time as we sent our 897 to you Lord Halifax was instructed to let the State Department have a copy of the telegram at once so thatthey should hold their hand until you had had an opportunity to comment on it.2. On 31st January the State Department confirmed that negotiations hadbeen in progress but said that they had not reached readiness for signature. on 3rd February, however, without further warning, Lord Halifax was informedthat the agreement had been signed and shortly afterwards it was published.3. Our special concern with Eire is obvious on political and geographicalgrounds, and is indeed much closer than that of the United States with theArgentine. We and the United States have, moreover, throughout kept in close touch in our general policy towards Eire, e.g., over the recent United Statesapproach to de Valera for the removal of the Axis representatives. For thisreason the political effect of the United States&apos; action in concluding an agree-ment with Southern Ireland on an important issue without consulting us seemsto us bound to injure our relations with de Valera politically, and may be embarrassing to the United States also, as it can only encourage him to try toplay off one against the other. It has, in fact, been hailed in Southern ireland as a diplomatic success for them.4. I trust therefore that you will be able to take the necessary steps tohave the agreement annulled. So far no response has been made to our&quot; telegramsor representations whether addressed personally to you or handed formally tothe State Department.Copy of a Telegram, No. 717, dated 16th March. 1945, from president roosevelt to the Prime Minister.(Personal and Top Secret.)I am surprised at your 904. There must have been some misunderstanding of my position. Furthermore, the circumstances of the agreement with Irelandwere fully explained to your people, Cadogan in particular, at Yalta.2. During the latter days of the Chicago Conference when it became increasingly doubtful that full agreement on aviation would be reached on a multilateral basis we held- preliminary discussions looking toward bilateral agreements, as Berle publicly stated, with a number of countries representedthere. Ireland was naturally one of these in view of its obvious geographicimportance to American air routes. The agreement followed the standard formdrawn up with the assistance of your people at Chicago and in no way prejudicesyour right to make similar arrangements. In the circumstances we saw no need to do more than advise your people, which we authorised Gray to do, beforesignature. One hour before the scheduled time of signature a copy of your897 was brought to the attention of Acting Secretary Grew. He advised methat in view of your message he was postponing signature until 3rd february to give me time to comment but that, the negotiations having been satisfactorilyconcluded, we could not in good faith refuse to sign nor could we risk the damage to Anglo-American relations which would result should it become known that your Government had objected to our concluding this agreement with Ireland.I saw no reason to instruct the State Department not to sign on 3rd February andI fully approve of its action. There can of course be no question of annullingthe agreement.   I am sorry but there it is.[29459]
3. I fully realise your concern on political grounds and your opinion, whichI share, of Ireland&apos;s role during the war. We instructed Gray to make clear tothe Irish that signature of the agreement indicated no change whatsoever in our attitude toward Ireland any more than our signature of a similar agreementwith Spain indicated any change in our attitude toward Franco.4. This agreement is however a post-war matter. You will recall howearnestly I endeavoured to secure your co-operation on the future of aviationduring the Chicago Conference. These bilateral aviation agreements were madenecessary by the failure of that Conference to reach a multilateral agreement per-mitting the natural development of Aviation. While I fully understand your own position, I think it only fair to tell you that aviation circles in this country are becoming increasingly suspicious that certain elements in England intend to try to block the development of International flying in general until the Britishaviation industry is further developed. Of course any feeling of complacence,even though wholly unwarranted at any time, on the part of the Irish has nowbeen somewhat deflated by their being left out of the San Francisco Conference.
