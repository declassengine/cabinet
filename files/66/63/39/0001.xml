THIS ^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.Copy No. o 3XWAR CABINET.THE UNITED NATIONS  RELIEF AND rehabilitation administration.Memorandum by the Minister of State.MY colleagues will be aware that all has not been well with U.N.R.R.A.The general impression has got abroad that U.N.R.R.A. is a large, over-staffedbody, swaddled in lawyers&apos; tape and incapable of taking resolute action.2. Much of the criticism which has been expressed in the Press and inParliament was unfair. It has been based upon the notion that all supplies toall liberated areas were the responsibility of U.N.R.R.A., so that if Dutchmenwere homeless or Belgian miners short of fats U.N.R.R.A. was to blame. It isnow sinking in that U.N.R.R.A. was not meant to do all this, being primarilyset up to help the destitute countries, but the sense of disappointment persists.3. Nevertheless, the criticisms were not wholly unfounded. U.N.R.R.A.has employed many whose services other institutions were only too ready togive up : the Director-General has often shown an unnecessary timidity and areluctance to get on with the job unless every detail was settled in advance; thepreponderance of the influence of American lawyers has been too evident; theMissions sent to countries in need of relief in the Balkans have been badlystaffed and in the particular case of Greece got mixed up with local politics.All this is true and I must admit that there have been times when I have wondered whether we had backed the right horse.4. I am glad to be able to say, however, that there have recently been marked signs of improvement in the manner in which U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s affairs areconducted. We are, I believe, now emerging from the period of frustration,which was to some extent inevitable in view of the long period betweenNovember 1943 and the time when U.N.R.R.A. could have something real to do.Much remains to be done, but I am encouraged by what I have seen in the last few weeks. The Director-General seems to have become more aware of the needfor rapid action and to be less worried by legal minutiae. Moreover, CommanderR. G. A. Jackson, lately of the Middle East Supply Centre, who has recently, a tour request, taken on the position of Senior Deputy Director-General, has alreadyhelped to bring about a great improvement in the U.N.R.R.A. Missions in greece and other countries round the Mediterranean, involving the disappearance ofmany of their staff who were unsuitable for their posts. The remarks made by allied representatives at the last meeting of the European Regional Committeeindicate that they too have noticed the reawakening of U.N.R.R.A. and areheartened by it.5. One question which is often asked about U.N.R.R.A. is : &quot; What has happened to all the money? &quot; It is sometimes hinted that it has all been spenton high salaries and administrative extravagance. The answer is that the greaterpart of the money voted to U.N.R.R.A. by His Majesty&apos;s and other Governmentsremains unspent. The latest figures I have seen show that supplies have beenprocured by U.N.R.R.A. to a value of 1102.000,000. U.N.R.R.A. have followed the policy of not locking up their money by procuring supplies in advance unless this is the only way to have them available when the time for. using them conies.12721   [29483]9 *) secret.W.P. (45) 184.21 st March, 1945.
It would, for instance, be wasteful to buy in advance and store such commodities as wheat, cotton and wool, which are plentiful. This does not mean, however,that U.N.R.R.A. has any surplus funds. The latest information we have isthat on present plans all U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s funds will be used up by the end of thisyear. As regards salaries, we shall have more information in the forthcoming report of the Director-General, but the broad limits are indicated by the fact thatthe total budgetary provision made for all administration expenses for allU.N.R.R.A. offices for the years 1944 and 1945 amounts to 117,500,000.6. U.N.R.R.A. has also at last got started over the care and repatriation of &quot;displaced persons.&quot; It has reached an agreement with S.H.A.E.F., withwhich it is working in the closest co-operation, and has already, at S.FLA.E.F.&apos;request, got a large number of trained teams on the continent ready to go into germany when S.H.A.E.F. &quot;gives the word. The reports we have received about this side of U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s work are encouraging.7. The importance to us of efficient and imaginative action by U.N.R.R.A.is already apparent in Greece. The implication of the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s paper on the Finance of Relief (W.P. (45) 163), in which the WarCabinet have concurred, is that we must look increasingly to U.N.R.R.A. forassistance elsewhere in Europe also if our own financial commitments are to bekept down.8. Other papers which have been before Ministers recently have stressed theneed for generous allocations of supplies and shipping to liberated countries,both to those which get their supplies through U.N.R.R.A. and to those who receive them direct. But what U.N.R.R.A. itself needs most at this moment is our encouragement and support in its reorganisation and our help in the provisionof qualified personnel, particularly for the field missions where the read, as opposed to the paper, work will be done. Given these, I believe U.N.R.R.A. canbecome a body worthy of our confidence and of the trust of the liberated countries.(Signed) R, K. L.Foreign Office, 21st March, 1945.
