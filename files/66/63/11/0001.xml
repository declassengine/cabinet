(45) 156.12^ March, 1945.WAR CABINET.VSOVIET FOREIGN POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may be interested to see the annexed extract from a semi-official letter written by Mr. Balfour, the retiring Minister at the Embassy in moscow, to the Head of the Northern Department of the Foreign Office, aboutSoviet policy in the Balkans.A. E.Foreign Office, 12th March, 1945.Extract from Letter dated 16th January, 1945, from Mr. Balfour (Moscow)to Mr, Warner.As I see it, on such evidence as comes to my mind, there is most certainlya long-term element in what the Russians are doing in the Balkans. Securitywrit large is the first and paramount factor, there as in relation to other neigh-bouring territories of the U.S.S.R. Ever since the visit here of Dr. Benes inDecember 1943, it has been perfectly clear, as was reported at the time in Moscowdespatch No. 7 of the 12th January, 1943, and again in Moscow despatch No. 73 ofthe 22nd February, 1944, about the Constituent Republics, that the Soviet Unionlooks upon the South-Eastern European area, no less than on Poland, as a securityzone in which it is to her peculiar interest to see that there is no renewal of theGerman Drang nach Osten.No plans for world organisation or pacts with the Western Powers willdeflect the IT.S.S.R. from buttressing up her security system in this region asa first line of defence. All-Slavism, on which I sent another despatch the otherday, is one important instrument of this insurance policy which demands asa corollary that the interests and influence of other Great Powers in the Sovietsecurity zone should be strictly subordinated to those of the U.S.S.R. It would,for example, be unthinkable in this setting that Czechoslovakia and Yugoslaviashould look as they did after the last war to the West for the main guarantee of their security rather than to Mother Russia in the East. So too, as Molotovhas more than once clearly implied during the discussions about the Hungarianarmistice, the U.S.S.R. has suffered too much during the war to allow her greatAllies to play more than a secondary part in dictating the treatment of ex-Germansatellites whom the Red army has defeated. 4 *In all this there is a well-defined long-term policy which, so far as can atpresent be foreseen is summed up in the word &quot; Security.&quot; I say &quot; at present &quot;because the self-confidence of the Soviet Union, which victory has immeasurablyincreased, combined with a love of power for its own sake which has distinguishedRussia&apos;s outstanding rulers throughout the ages, might cause this policy asit unfolds itself to assume dangerous forms. In Persia, for example, it alreadylooks as though the determination to secure an oil concession in the North atthe first convenient opportunity is not merely determined by economic reasons,but also by a wish to secure ultimate control over the oil-producing region itself.In this latter respect, the Soviet Union is no doubt primarily actuated by the wish to see that the concession is efficiently worked. Over and above this objective12697   [29401]
2may, however, be discerned a resolve to reassert Russia&apos;s pre-Revolution positionin Persia. So far as the Balkans are concerned we can at any rate take heart of grace from the wholly correct attitude which the Soviet Government have sofar adopted towards the Greek imbroglio. At the same time the news from athens and comments on it in the western press have been presented by the moscow newspapers to the public in such a way as to make it clear enough in what direction official sympathies lie.Whilst the determination of the Soviet Government to maintain and develop a position of paramount influence in Balkan countries other than Greece canthus, I think, be taken for granted as a matter of well-defined long-term policy,there still remains, within that overriding framework, good reason for arguingas you do that Russian actions to which we object are the result of mindsautomatically working along old lines. We must at all times make allowance forthe Bolshevik mentality, which, if it has repudiated the idea of world revolutionas a fixed aim, is still infected with suspicion of the bourgeois world, Marxistin outlook, and imbued with a rough and ready disposition indiscriminately tolump together as &apos;&apos; Fascist beasts &apos;&apos; all those who criticise or appear to obstruct the will of the Soviet Union.In addition to this state of mind must be set, so far as defeated enemies areconcerned, and particularly Germany, something of the Old Testament adage of&quot;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.&quot; This does not mean that theRussians, who, for all the Tartar strain in them, lack the coldly calculating-Sadism of the Herrenvolk, will indulge in wholesale butchery on the Maidanekmodel. But it does imply on present showing the mass deportation for forced labour in the Soviet Union of able-bodied Germans, including Germans belongingto minority groups in satellite States, a tight squeeze of ex-enemy governments in the matter of reparation deliveries and a ruthless attitude towards all elements in neighbouring countries suspected of collaborationism. By the same tokenresistance groups, wherever situated, will receive the utmost encouragement,without too nice a regard for adjusting excessive claims.on their part for post-warrecognition to the principles of democracy as understood in the West.In the respects just mentioned we can expect the Soviet machine to go onclanking away along the old lines. I fear, however, that it would be somewhatover-optimistic to conclude that the clanking process is solely the outcome ofinsufficient information and reflection whether by the Kremlin or toughlyimpetuous generals on the spot. &quot; The old lines &quot; are, as I see it, very deliberatelytraced against the background of the Soviet past and the bitter experience of thewar. It would be a mistake to set store on the persuasive powers of the allies to eradicate them from the minds of the men who rule Russia to-day, beginning with Stalin himself, who, as an old-time revolutionary and the chief of his people in repelling the barbarian invader, shares the prevailing outlook in full measure.On the other hand, as a shrewd realist, Stalin, so far as can be judged, hasno wish to overreach the limits within which he can prudently exercise autocraticpower. Although &quot;deathly proud&quot; and quick to react against the slightestsuggestion of Soviet inferiority or bad faith, Stalin and the more sensible of his followers are no less imbued with a jealous wish to raise the reputation of theU.S.S.R. in the eyes of the world. It follows that where, but only where, theAllies have just cause for complaint that their legitimate interests are being setat nought, a restraining influence can be brought to bear by appeals to Stalinhimself on matters of real importance. The centralised character of the Sovietmachine unfortunately multiplies the number of such matters beyond what wouldbe normal in our dealings with regimes of another character. But I see noremedy for this.I hope that these reflections, which largely repeat what has been said in earlier Moscow reports, may contribute to any more detailed study of Soviet aims and policy in the Balkans and South-Eastern Europe.
