THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT---------243Printed&apos;for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. V Copy No.W.P. (45) 190.23rd March, 1945.WAR CABINET.COAL.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE Lord Presidents Committee consider it necessary to draw the urgentattention of&quot;the War Cabinet to the gravity of the coal position.2. The Minister of Fuel and Power estimates that, to meet requirementsamounting to 192-3 million tons, total supplies during the coal year 1945-4.6will be 188-3 million tons (of which 175 million tons represents production frommines), thus leaving a deficit of 4 million tons. The assumptions on which this estimate is based are set out in a Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power(L.P. (45) 61), which was considered by the Lord Presidents Committee at their meeting on the 21st March (L.P. (45) 16th Meeting, Minute 2). No allowance has been made for supplies to S.H.A.E.F. after the end of August, for any supplies to liberated territories or for the increased demand for gas coal (about*-75 million tons) which would result from the resumption of full public lightingas from the 15th July next. A particularly disquieting feature of the situationis that it is expected that, at the beginning of next winter, distributed stockswill not exceed at the most 15^ million tons, as compared with million tons at the beginning of the winter of 1944-45.3. The Lord Presidents Committee are satisfied that the various expedientsfor securing increased production from the existing labour force have beenexploited to the fullest extent possible in war-time conditions; and that it isnot possible to count on any further reduction in consumption, whether byeconomies or by increased efficiency in distribution control. They believe that,unless the labour force in the coal-mining industry can be increased, there is a grave danger of a breakdown in coal supplies during the forthcoming winter.4. The decline in the output of deep-mined coal is also having a serious effect on coal prices. In the summer of 1944 the Lord Presidents committee agreed that the price of coal should be increased by 4s. per ton as from the1st August, 1944. It was then hoped that this increase would serve to meet the continuing deficit on the Coal Charges Account and to make possible the repay-ment of the accumulated deficit over a period of about one year. As a result ofthe decline in output, however, the accumulated deficit stood at  25f million onthe 31st December, 1944. In a Memorandum (L.P. (45) 64), which was alsobefore the Lord Presidents Committee at their meeting on the 21st March(LP. (45) 16th Meeting, Minute 3), the Minister of Fuel and Power has reportedthat, in order to repay this deficit by about the 31st May, 1946, as well as tomeet the estimated current deficit for the year 1945-46, it will be necessary toincrease the price of coal by 3s. Qd. per ton as from the 1st May, 1945, with acorresponding increase in the price of coke. (Should the coal merchants make out a case for an increase in their margin, a further increase in the retail priceof domestic coal will be necessary as from the same date.)5. An increase in the price of coal of 3s. 6d. per ton would represent anincrease of 0-7 in the cost-of-living index. More important, it would have mostserious repercussions on production costs throughout British industry duringthis vital period of reconstruction; for instance, it would result in an increaseof 7s. per ton in the price of heavy steel. It is, however, very desirable that the[29494]
debt on the Coal Charges Account should be liquidated as rapidly as possible;and the only way of reducing the price increases necessary for this purpose isto secure an increase in output.6. In all these circumstances, the Lord President&apos;s Committee feel thatthey have no alternative but to recommend to the War Cabinet the only measure which can be taken to obtain an early increase in the output of deep-mined coal namely, the early release, for return to the mines, of the experienced minersstill in the Forces.7. Should the War Cabinet approve this proposal in principle, the lord presidents Committee suggest that a Cabinet Committee should be appointedto work out, as a matter of urgency, the detailed arrangements for carrying it into effect, and to consider, what steps can be taken to ensure that any increaseiD production which may result is not rendered nugatory owing to transport difficulties. This Committee might also be asked to examine the question ofcoal prices and to recommend what increase will be necessary, having regardto such increased production as may be expected to result from the arrange-ments which it proves possible to make for the release of ex-miners from theForces.C.
