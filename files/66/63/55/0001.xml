THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 200.28th March, 1945.INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF COLONIAL POLICY.Memorandum by. the Chairman of the Armistice and Post-war committee.IN view of developments which have occurred since this subject wasconsidered by the War Cabinet in December 1944* the Secretary of State for theColonies has prepared a further memorandum (Annex), which was considered bythe Armistice and Post-War Committee at their Meeting&apos; on the 26th March. Inthis Paper the Colonial Secretary sets out his reasons why it would be no longerpracticable to proceed with the proposals originally proposed in W.P. (44) 738.The Colonial Secretary recommended : (i) That we should agree to the continuance of a Mandatory System inrespect of existing Mandated territories and territories removed fromthe enemy, but that we should not agree to the suggestion that theMandatory System might be extended to &apos;&apos; any other territory whichmight voluntarily be placed under trusteeship.&quot;(ii) That certain amendments (specified in the appendix to his Paper) shouldbe made in the composition and procedure of the Permanent mandates commission and in the terms of the B Mandates.(iii) That the Dominion Governments should be informed, by an oralstatement at the forthcoming meeting, that we hoped to limit thediscussions in Washington and San Francisco to the points in (i)and (ii) above; that, therefore, for reasons given in paragraphs 2 and 3of the Annex to this Paper, the plan proposed in W.P. (44) 738 wouldbe withdrawn for the time being, and that, in particular, the proposalfor the establishment of an International Colonial Centre should be dropped.(iv) That in any conversation with the United States Government we shouldurge that discussions of this subject at San Francisco should be confined to the settling of a general formula, the detailed discussions to be referred later to some smaller and more appropriate body towork out.2. The Armistice and Post-War Committee agreed with the colonial secretary&apos;s recommendations, but thought that it would be necessary, in the courseof conversations with the Dominion representatives, to reaffirm our policy infavour of Regional Commissions, and to explain that we did not want to mixthem up with discussions on Mandates, since to do so would prejudice the chances of securing the establishment of Regional Commissions as a separate issue.3.   I now seek the approval of the War Cabinet to these recommendations.(Initialled) C. R. A,(On behalf of the Committee.)Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,28th March, 1945.* W.P. (44) 738, W.M.

ANNEX.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Prime Minister&apos;s reply* to the Lord Presidents Minute,t which hasbeen circulated to the Committee, states categorically that nothing was decidedat Yalta which would prevent us proceeding with the plan approved by thisCommittee in December, 19444 Et is, therefore, on other grounds that we must decide whether it is in fact wise to proceed on the lines then agreed.2. The Colonial Office memorandum approved by the Committee was the product of a long and careful examination. I thought then, and I still think,that it represents the best policy for our Colonial Empire. I must, however, con-fess that events since this paper was discussed by the Committee make me very doubtful as to our chances of getting it agreed elsewhere. The following are myreasons : (a) The Foreign Office paper dealing with the legal aspects of the liquidation of Mandates makes it clear that any substitute for the present systemmust be agreed by all members of the League of Nations as well asby the United States of America, as one of the original Allied andAssociated Powers.(b) When I was in Washington in December I had many hours&apos; conversationwith officials of the State Department. Although, of course, I had no authority to put forward the Committee&apos;s memorandum officially onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, I did try it out informally.The reception was most disappointing. No real attempt was madeto. appreciate its effects upon Colonial administration as a whole,but it was viewed entirely in relation to the occupation by the UnitedStates after the war of the Japanese islands. For this purpose, theone thing that matters is that the United States, while occupying the islands, should not appear to have a theoretical sovereignty overthem (for that would be Imperialism).(c) The responses from the Dominions show that Australia and New Zealandare in favour of the continuance of the Mandates, and that Canada,while declining to express an opinion for itself, thinks that american public opinion will not be satisfied unless the Mandates continue.(d) It is unlikely, under present circumstances, that we should get muchsupport for our plan from other Colonial Powers. The apparentalternative, which confines the relations of the new body to the mandated areas alone, and so lets out Holland, Spain and Portugalcompletely, and France and Belgium to a great degree, will obviously be most attractive to them.I do not think, therefore, that we are likely to get a measure of general acceptance for the plan proposed. That in itself would not be a decisive argument against making an effort, as apart from the possibility that, with all the difficul-ties, we might succeed in getting agreement, even if we failed, we might be in abetter tactical position for securing a favourable compromise.3. The timing of events has, however, turned out quite differently fromthat which I expected last October when I began the preparation of the ColonialOffice memorandum. I had hoped then that such a policy, if approved by theCabinet and agreed by the. Dominions, could be discussed in the first instancewith the United States alone. Subsequently it could have been agreed with theother Colonial Powers, and when eventually the time came for a Conference ofthe World Association, the whole thing would have been cut and dried. that now is obviously impossible. It is implicit in the passage in the Yalta Protocolthat the future of Mandates shall be a subject for discussion at San Francisco.Our argument for the abolition of the Mandates is to put forward a plan whichis applicable to the whole Colonial Empire. If we had to do that at San Franciscoit would mean throwing the whole Colonial Empire open to discussion by thismotley assembly, a procedure which I should regard as hazardous in the extreme.* A.P.W.

4. The alternative to pressing on with our original plan is now to accept in principle the continuance of the Mandates, but to insist on their revision inorder to eliminate their worst features. The chief objection to the Mandatorysystem was not, as some people suppose, the amount of supervision which itentailed. That on the whole did little harm, although some people may questionwhether it did much good.  The real objections were :  (a) certain conditions attaching particularly to the B Mandates (which mostconcern us); and(b) the sense of impermanence which the absence of permanent british sovereignty gave in the territories concerned.With regard to (a), I attach an Appendix which shows briefly the changesI should like to see made both in the machinery of the Mandatory system and inthe conditions attaching to the Mandates.With regard to (b), there is no complete remedy other than the assumptionby  treat Britain of full sovereignty, but something might be done to allay anxietyby a declaration at the appropriate time by the Prime Minister on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, and, if possible in conjunction with the Dominions, thatthere could be no question of a transfer of the Mandates without the consent ofthe Mandatory Power, and that, as far as Great Britain was concerned, suchconsent would in no circumstances be given.5. The choice before us is admittedly a most difficult one, but I havereluctantly come to the conclusion that, on the whole, the course suggested inparagraph 4 is the one for us to adopt. In reaching this conclusion I have been particularly influenced by the fears expressed in paragraph 3. I should, however,only recommend this course if it were agreed that we should put forward thenecessary amendments and should be firm in our insistence upon them. If theCommittee agree with this view, we should then have to consider the next steps.6. The first question is the attitude to be taken up at the Conference withthe Dominions next month. We should, of course, have no difficulty with any ofthe Dominions, except South Africa, over a decision to support the continuanceof the Mandatory system. It would, however, I think, be essential to tell themthat, in view of the changed circumstances, we proposed, for the time being atany rate, to postpone the rest of our plan. I am quite certain that any attemptto discuss Regional Commissions at the same time that we are discussingMandates would be to arouse hostility and suspicion among other Colonial Powersand completely to destroy the chances of securing what I believe to be far themost important and far the most beneficial step in international Colonial policy.The establishment of the International Colonial Centre, which admittedly wehad proposed more as a bargaining counter than as something which was particu-larly valuable in itself, and to which none of the Dominions seem to have attachedmuch importance, should now be dropped.7. We are then committed by the Yalta Protocol to consultation on thissubject before San Francisco both with America and with the other major Powers,including, of course, China. I do not know how the Foreign Office, in view ofthe time-table, thinks it possible to carry out this undertaking. It is clear that, ifthe discussions are to include not only a discussion on the principle of Mandatesbut also of the detailed changes which we desire, they will be long and hard, andI see no prospect of bringing them to a successful conclusion before the openingof the San Francisco Conference. The best course would be to postpone any discussion on &apos;&apos; Territorial Trusteeship &apos;&apos; to some later meeting of an ad hoc body.But, if that were impossible, it might be practicable to confine the discussion and decision at San Francisco to some general formula making the new united nations Organisation the residuary legatee of the League of Nations in the matterof Mandates, while fully preserving our right to changes in detail. The detailed discussion might then be referred to some smaller and more appropriateCommittee to be worked out.8. There is one other point. The conclusion of the Crimea Conference refers to the possibility of the Mandatory System being extended not only to existingMandates or territories detached from the enemy as a result of the present war,but also to &quot; any other territory which might voluntarily be placed under trusteeship.&quot; This proposal, though it appears harmless, is fraught with thegreatest difficulty for us in the future. We shall be continually under pressure from some elements in the United States to take advantage of&apos; this proposal tobring the whole of our Colonial administration under international review.   I am
sure that neither this Government, nor, I hope, any succeeding Government, wouldsuccumb to this pressure, but it will certainly raise for future Colonial Secretariesinnumerable difficulties in the United States, in this country and in the colonial territories themselves. I hope, therefore, that we shall resist any proposal of this character.(Initialled) O. S.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,19th March. 1945.Appendix.Modifications desired in the Mandate System and Terms of B Mandates.I. The Permanent Mandates Commission.(a) In future the Commission should be composed of Government representa-tives and not experts chosen for their individual qualifications.(b) The Commission should report to the Economic and Social Council, which,in turn, would make its recommendations on P.M.C. business direct to the Govern-ment of the Mandatory Power concerned.(c) All Mandatory Powers should be entitled to sit as voting members of theEconomic and Social Council when P.M.G. business is under discussion.(d) On these conditions there is no objection to the representatives of Man-datory Powers continuing to be in a minority on the P.M.C., and subject to this the exact composition can be left to the general assembly.(e) The I.L.O. and any other functional agencies should be entitled to nominate experts to attend PMC. meetings when their special subjects are underdiscussion.(/) No right of visiting and inspection to Mandated Territories by the P.M.G.should be conceded, but there is no objection to visits being arranged with theconsent of the Mandatory Power.(g) Any suggestion that the P.M.C. should have a representative on regional commissions for areas which include a Mandated Territory must be resisted asconflicting with the whole nature and purpose of Regional Commissions.II. Terms of the B Mandates.(a) Defence. The prohibition of the establishment of military or naval bases, the erection of fortifications or the organisation of native military forces is clearly obsolete and should be removed. The defence role of Mandated Terri-tories should be determined in relation to the world security plan.(b) The provisions requiring equal rights for all nationals of States Membersof the League with the nationals of the Mandatory Power in respect of entry andconduct of business may compromise internal security and should be abolished.(c) The open door economic provisions must be got rid of. The territoriesmust be free to adjust their economic policy in the same manner as other territories.(d) The right conferred on all missionaries, nationals of States Members ofthe League to open schools in a Mandated Territory makes a planned educationalpolicy impossible.(e) The inclusion of the essential features of the Mandates in Article 22 ofthe Covenant made the revision of the terms of the Mandates extremely difficult.This mistake should be avoided by making provision whereby the terms of the mandates may be revised by the Economic and Social Council on the recommen-dation of the P.M.C. with the consent of the Mandatory Power.
