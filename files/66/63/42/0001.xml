THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. Copy No. 3 5- IW.P. (45) 187. I22nd March, 1945. UWAR CABINET.AFFAIRS ON THE COPPERBELT, NORTHERN RHODESIA.The Case of Mr. F. S. Maybank.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. Sir Walter Citrine and Mr. B. Goodwin, President of the northern rhodesia Mine Workers&apos; Union, who was in this country for the World TradeUnion Conference, called to see me last week to present the case for the immediatereturn to Northern Rhodesia of Mr. Maybank, who has recently been reappointedto be General Secretary of the Northern Rhodesia Mine Workers&apos; Union. Ipromised to consider their representations.2. Mr. Maybank was detained in and subsequently deported from northern rhodesia in 1942 owing to subversive activities directed against the war effort.(W.P. (43) 264 and W.M. (43) 94th Conclusions, Item 3, refer).3. The war effort of Northern Rhodesia consists primarily of the productionof copper, and the whole of the output of the Northern Rhodesia copper-mines isstill being purchased by His Majesty&apos;s Government for British and Americanwar requirements. My own view, with which the Governor agrees, is, therefore,that Mr. Maybank should not be allowed to return to Northern Rhodesia until after the end of the war with Germany. When that time comes, however, thereason which in my view makes it imperative to keep him out of northern rhodesia will no longer have the same force, and, indeed, it seems likely that theDefence Regulations under which he was deported and is at present prevented from returning will then have been revoked, in which case it would no longer bepossible to prevent his return.4. I now propose, therefore, subject to the agreement of my colleagues, toinform Sir Walter Citrine that I am not prepared to ask the Governor to allowMr. Maybank&apos;s return at the present time, but that no objection will be raised to his return after the end of the war with Germany.O. S.Colonial Office, 22nd March, 1945.[29484]
