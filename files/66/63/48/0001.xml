Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 193.24th March, 1945WAR CABINET.TRANSFER OF WARSHIPS TO CANADA.Further Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.1. -At their meeting on the 27th December, 1944 (War Cabinet 174 (44),item 4), the War Cabinet authorised the Admiralty to offer a flotilla of fleetdestroyers and two light fleet carriers on loan to the Royal Canadian Navy. Theconditions of the offer were to include the stipulation that the ships should remain under Admiralty operational control and that, although it was contemplated to employ them in the Pacific, they could, if necessary, be sent to the Indian Ocean.2. An offer in these terms was duly made to the Canadian Naval Mission inthis country, and it soon became apparent that this stipulation might give riseto difficulty. In spite of much negotiation with the Mission, an official reply hasnow been received from them stating that the Canadian Government accept theoffer, but only on the understanding -(a) that Canada has the right to buy the light fleet carriers at a later dateif desired;(b) that the employment of all the ships is restricted to the Pacific.3. The first of these conditions, which was foreshadowed as a possibility inmy previous paper on this subject (W.P. (44) 759), should present no difficulty.4. On further examination of the operational implications, the Naval staff have concluded that there would be no substantial objection to the secondcondition, and that, in view of the long-term advantages of encouraging canada to develop rather more ambitious naval forces after the war than she maintainedbefore it, this condition also should be accepted. Its application to the destroyersraises no problems, but the entry of the light fleet carriers into operation in the pacific will need to be fitted in with our general programme for the build-up andlogistic support of our forces there. I suggest that this should be explained tothe Canadian Government, who should be asked, for this reason, to agree thatthe details of the selection of the two carriers to be transferred and of theirdespatch to the Pacific should be worked out by the Canadian Naval Authoritiesand the Admiralty. I would propose to indicate that we should expect theCanadian ships to be part of the British Pacific Fleet.5. I accordingly seek authority to inform the Canadian Government, throughthe Canadian Naval Mission (i) that we agree to their having an option to buy the light fleet carriers,and that we should be prepared to discuss the terms of sale either now or upon their desiring to exercise the option, whichever they prefer;(ii) that we agree that both the destroyers and the carriers shall operate under the orders of Commander-in-Chief, British Pacific Fleet, untilthe end of the war against Japan, and subject in the case of thecarriers to the settlement of details on the lines proposed in para-graph 4 above.A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1, 24th March, 1945.V        Copy No. J &apos;j[29506]
