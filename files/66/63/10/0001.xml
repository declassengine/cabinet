I recently circulated to the War Cabinet a memorandum (W.P. (45) 107) inwhich I invited my colleagues to approve a refusal to accredit Andrew Rothstein toS.IT.A.E.F. as a war correspondent of Tass Agency with 21 Army Group. Broadly,the grounds on which I based this request were, first, that Rothstein, though well-known and respected in press circles in this country, is a long-standing member of the BritishCommunist Party; and secondly, that since it is on this ground of Communist Partymembership that the War Cabinet have hitherto refused to approve the accrediting ofwar correspondents of the &quot; Daily Worker &quot;, it would be wholly inconsistent with that policy to accredit Rothstein and would, in fact, involve a similar concession to the&quot; Daily Worker &quot;.2. When my Paper was discussed by the War Cabinet on 26th February, 1945,the War Cabinet asked me to look into the possibility of limiting the accrediting ofRothstein to S.H.A.E.F. in such a way that he would not enjoy the full privileges ofan accredited war correspondent, such as admission to military press conferences.3. I wrote in the above sense to General Bedell Smith, General Eisenhower&apos;s Chiefof Staff, suggesting that the time might now be ripe for S.H.A.E.F. to institute twoforms of accrediting correspondents: a full one giving the right to wear uniform andthe entry to all conferences, and an alternative form which would confer ordinarynewspaper facilities such as correspondents enjoy, for instance, in Paris.4. General Bedell Smith has replied as follows:  &quot; I quite agree on the conditions under which this correspondent can berecognized and- I propose that he should proceed to Belgium as a &quot; recognized &quot;S.H.A.E.F. correspondent and be attached to the S.H.A.E.F. Mission to Belgium.This would mean that he would not wear uniform and would not have access to&apos; off the record &apos; and other press conferences to which fully accredited War Corres-coorespondents are invited, nor could he be treated as a pari-military (sic) individualgiving him the normal facilities of accommodation and messing from Army sources.Transmission of copy must necessarily follow that of accredited War Correspondentsand it is preferable that he be advised that facilities are rather taxed for Pressrequirements and that the Air Despatch Letter Service might be the best meansavailable to him.&quot;5. I think this affords a solution of the present problem on the lines which theWar Cabinet had in mind. But it must be borne in mind that Rothstein has asked for&quot; accreditation to the S.H.A.E.F. Military Mission in Brussels &quot;. It is true thatthe Minister of Information^ paper W.P. (45) 115 states that the Tass Agency onlywant to appoint Rothstein as their standing political correspondent in Brussels and ifthis is so the suggestion made by S.H.A.E.F. should serve their purpose. But it is atleast possible that when Rothstein is informed by S.H.A.E.F. that he can proceedto Brussels as a civil correspondent (i.e., not wearing uniform) and that accreditation isnot necessary for his purposes, he will represent that this is insufficient, and will press for full accrediting. This would be extremely awkward, for to some extent we shouldalready have compromised the principle which we have applied to the &quot; Daily Worker &quot;.I still hope that the War Cabinet will on further consideration decide to refuse Rothstein&apos;application outright. But if they decide to adopt General Bedell Smith&apos;s plan I think&quot;we can just hold the &quot; Daily Worker &quot; decision so far as a full war correspondent isconcerned, though wc should doubtless have to let them have a political correspondentin Brussels on the same lines as the Tass Agency. I hope, however, that there will bea clear decision to go no further than this.P. J. G.The War Office,12th March, 1945.(B44/1SS)   qo   3/45   W.O.P.   21426
