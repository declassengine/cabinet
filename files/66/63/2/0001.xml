sJ^-JTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENPROHIBITION AND INVALIDATION OF MARRIAGES between members OF THE ALLIED EXPEDITIONARY FORCES and germans.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Armistice and Post-War Committee.THE A.P.W. Committee have considered a proposal that S.C.A.E.F. shouldpromulgate a law, in occupied Germany, prohibiting marriages between themembers of the Allied Expeditionary Forces and Germans, and providing thatany marriages performed contrary to this law should be absolutely null and void.The history of this proposal is contained in the attached Report * which wasconsidered by the A.P.W. Committee on the 5th March.t2. The United States State Department and the United States Militaryauthorities have approved the issue of the proposed law, which has, in fact,already been signed by the Supreme Commander. Its promulgation was preventedat the last moment in order to enable Ministers to consider the position.3. The Committee are in full agreement with the policy of &quot; non-frater-nisation &apos;&apos; between the occupying Allied Forces and the Germans, and favour theprohibition of marriages between Germans and members of those forces. Thequestion at issue, however, is whether, if such marriages do take place in defiance of the prohibition, they should be invalidated or not.4. The Attorney-General is of the opinion (see paragraph 3 of the attached report) that legally it would be intra vires for the Supreme Commander not onlyto prohibit such marriages, but also to declare them invalid. In favour of thiscourse, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Warconsider that it is essential, both on policy and security grounds, to take allpossible steps to prevent such marriages. This will require effective deterrentsto both parties. The only course likely definitely to prevent the Germans fromcontracting such marriages is to declare that if contracted they will be invalid.5. The remainder of the Committee, on the other hand, feel the gravestobjections on principle to the invalidation of such marriages. It would be con-trary to the general trend of marriage legislation in this country, which has consistently avoided the use of invalidation save where there is a basis of moralobjection to the union. Invalidation would be permanent in its effects and wouldmake the offspring of the union illegitimate. They feel that Parliament, publicopinion and the Churches are likely to be strongly critical of a provision of this nature. They agree that strong action must be taken against those who defythe law and contract such marriages, but in their view this should be done not by invalidation, but by penal action against those who contract, and possibly thosewho solemnise or register, such marriages.ft. In view of the importance of the principle involved, and the possibilityof a difference of view between the United States Government and ourselves, theCommittee feel that this is an issue that should be decided by the War Cabinet.Printed for the War Cabinet.

ANNEX.[A.P.W. (45) 21.]WAR CABINET.Armistice and Post-War Committee.PROHIBITION AND INVALIDATION OF MARRIAGES between members OF THE ALLIED EXPEDITIONARY FORCES and germans.Report by the Chairman of the Official Committee on Armistice terms and Civil Administration.Introduction.1. At the Meeting of the A.P.W. Committee held on the 25th January, 1945(A.P.W. (45) 2nd Meeting, Minute 3), Ministers endorsed the policy of non-fraternisation in occupied Germany and the definition of that policy issued byS.C.A.E.F. to the forces under his command. In the discussion, however, theSecretary of State for Air, who agreed entirely with the policy of non-f raternisa-tion, said that he had recently been informed that S.H.A.E.F. proposed topromulgate an order prohibiting Anglo-German marriages and declaring anythat took place to be invalid. Whilst he agreed with the prohibition of thesemarriages, he considered their invalidation was a matter of high policy about which Ministers should be consulted, even though he understood that it was probably legal for S.H.A.E.F. to issue such an order. The Committee invited theService Ministers to consider the question of Anglo-German marriages and, ifnecessary, to bring the matter before the Committee.History of the matter.2. The history of the proposed S.H.A.E.F. order on this subject is asfollows : At the end of October 1944 the War Office received from S.H.A.E.F. adraft of the law to be issued by the Supreme Commander in the course of themilitary government of the area under his control dealing with &apos;&apos; marriage with members of the Allied Expeditionary Force.&quot; This prohibited the celebration ofa marriage in the occupied territory of Germany with any British or UnitedStates member of the Allied Expeditionary Force unless the written authorityof the Supreme Commander should first have been obtained. It also provided thatany marriage performed contrary to the draft law should be absolutely nulland void.3. Meetings were held in London on the 23rd November and 8th December,1944, in order to consider the legal validity of the proposed law from the UnitedKingdom point of view; both meetings were attended by the Attorney-Generaland the Judge Advocate-General and, at the second meeting, Brigadier-GeneralE. C. Betts, United States Theatre Judge-Advocate, was also present. though there was general agreement that it was intra vires for the Supreme Commanderto prohibit marriages in the occupied territory of Germany between members ofthe forces under his command and other persons, there was at first some doubt whether the further provision that such marriages, if contracted, should also benull and void would be regarded as valid in the British courts. However, afterthe second meeting the Attorney-General issued a memorandum (at Annex I) in
which, although certain amendments were suggested to the draft as it then stood,the Attorney-General accepted the view that S.C.A.E.F. had power to declareinvalid, as well as to prohibit, the marriages in question. He thought this power could be supported both on grounds of security and also because occupying forcesdo not become subject to the local law, except to the extent agreed by theirCommander; hence, S.C.A.E.F. would be entitled to order that the existing localmarriage laws should not apply to members of his forces.4. Amendments were then made to the draft law to meet the points recorded in the Attorney-General&apos;s memorandum at Annex I, and the draft was sent tothe State Department for approval before promulgation. The State Departmenthave approved the latter, but the Foreign Office were successful in preventing atthe last moment its promulgation by S.H.A;E.F., pending the ascertainment of ministerial views.  The text of the proposed law as it now stands is at Annex II.Main points for decision. .,5. In view of the opinion of the Attorney-General, the Official Committeehave proceeded on the basis of the general legality of the proposed law. Theyhave, therefore, confined their consideration to the questions of general policy involved, the most important of which appear to be : (i) Should such marriages contracted in Germany during the operationalperiod be invalidated ?(ii) Should any exceptions be permitted to the general prohibition?(iii) Should the policy for the operational period be continued subsequentlyin the Control Commission period?(iv) To what extent should the policy be applied in Austria ?(y) Should the proposed policy apply to members of U.N.R.R.A. and other international organisations and agencies ?(vi) What action is desirable by way of consultation with the Dominionsand the Allies before the law, if approved, is promulgated ?Discussion.6. On the first point, it is felt that since the policy of non-fraternisationhas been approved, the prohibition of marriages with Germans in occupiedGermany must also be approved as an unavoidable and essential part of the non-fraternisation policy. If, however, such prohibition is only laid down for members of the Allied Forces by appropriate Fleet, General or Air 0&apos;rders, whilstthere might be some deterrent to the Allied party to the marriage, there wouldbe none to the German. Refusal to permit such marriages was the original policyin the British army of occupation in the last war, but these marriages were notrendered null and void and the refusal proved ineffective; and by March 1920arrangements had been made to enable local marriages to take place, with theresult that three years later about 500 marriages had been celebrated. a prohibition of such marriages and the rendering of them null and void, ifcontracted in defiance of such prohibition, if made part of the local law andwidely published both in Germany and to the Allied Expeditionary Force should act as a powerful deterrent and, in the light of past experience, would appear tobe the only really satisfactory way of preventing marriages of the type inquestion. It should be pointed out, however, that, if approved,. the proposedlaw would have no validity outside occupied Germany and evasion of it wouldbe possible by crossing the frontiers to neighbouring countries. It is not thoughtthat it would be practicable to secure the passage of legislation in. such neigh-bouring countries, which would have to include the United Kingdom, to make such marriages contracted therein null and void. On the other hand, the numberof such marriages likely to take place across the German frontiers is bound tobe small in view of the inherent difficulties in making the necessary journeys, andit is considered that, although this possibility is a loophole to the suggested1 policywhich should not be overlooked, its existence is unlikely seriously to lessen the deterrent effect of the proposed law.7. On the second question, it is considered that it would be unwise to lay down the prohibition in such a categorical manner as is proposed in paragraph 1of the text of the draft letter at Annex II. An earlier draft of the law permittedmarriages if the written authorisation of the Supreme Commander or of hissubordinate commanders, duly authorised, had been obtained. It is consideredthat whilst the proposed law should remain categorical as regards marriage with enemy nationals in Germany, marriage with persons other than enemy nationalsshould be permitted with the written authority of the Supreme Commander.[29378] b 2
It is pointed out that amendment of the proposed law on these lines wouldmake the general policy in it less oppressive and easier to apply during theControl Commission period. Moreover, it is thought to avoid certain difficultieswhich might otherwise arise under the United Kingdom Foreign Marriage Act of1892.In order to meet the difficulties of persons of dual enemy and Alliednationality, e.g., those from the Sudeten area of Czechoslovakia, it is consideredthat the exception permitting marriage with persons other than enemy nationalsshould be extended to cover in addition enemy nationals who also possess a dualnationality.8. If the above policy is approved for the operational period, it is necessaryto decide whether it should be continued in the subsequent Control Commissionperiod. It is considered that, at any rate in the early years, the case for. theprohibition and invalidation of marriages of the type in question is as strong as during the operational period. The A.P.W. Committee have already approved the policy of non-fraternisation in the Control Commission period * and thecourse proposed as regards marriages is based on that policy. If the policy is continued in the Control Commission period, it should naturally be applied to thestaff of the Control Commission, as well as to the Allied Forces themselves. Thelegal basis of the policy during this period would probably be a law promulgatedby the German authorities at the direction of the Control Commission.9. In the case of Austria, it is submitted that a similar policy should befollowed during the operational period. It is not, however, thought possible todecide at present on the subsequent Allied Commission period since it may beAllied policy by that time substantially to vary the policy of non-fraternisationin Austria,&quot;as distinct from Germany. It is considered, therefore, that thedecision whether to continue the proposed marriage policy in Austria duringthe Allied Commission period should&apos; be postponed for separate considerationnearer the time.10. If the policy proposed be applied to members of the Allied Expedi-tionary Force, it would seem only right that it should also apply to personnel of U.N.R.R.A. and other international organisations and agencies which maybe functioning in Germany during the operational period, and the initial years,at any rate, of the subsequent Control Commission period. It is understood that,by American military law, personnel of U.N.R.RA. carrying out their activitiesat the request of the Supreme Commander would be subject to that law. It is,however, more doubtful whether they would be subject to the provisions ofthe Army Act. In view, therefore, of the position under American militarylaw and the fact that U.N.R.R.A. and the other international organisations and agencies will only be operating in Germany with the consent of the militaryauthorities and sometimes, indeed, as their agents, it is considered that theproposed policy as regards marriages should be applied to the personnel of suchorganisations, both in the operational and initial Control Commission periods,in the same way as to members of the Allied Expeditionary Force.11. It is clear that if the policy as regards marriages suggested in theabove paragraphs be approved by Ministers, consultation will be necessary withthe Dominion authorities and also with certain Allied authorities since theproposed law would apply to Dominion and Allied personnel serving in theAllied Expeditionary Force. Up to date, the Canadian military authorities inLondon have been provided with copies of the two memoranda on this subject by the Attorney-General, but the matter has not been discussed with them, nor have any communications passed with the other Dominions. As far as is known,no discussions have taken place with the Allied Governments concerned. Asregards the latter, it is thought that the most convenient and speediest methodof consultation with them would be through the S.H.A.E.F. missions to theGovernments concerned.12. Apart from the questions of general policy discussed above, certain amendments are suggested to the proposed law at Annex II, in order to improveits detailed provisions. Thus, it is considered necessary to amend the originalparagraph 9 in order to make it clear that a member of the Allied ExpeditionaryForce-who violates the provisions of the law will not be tried in a military* A.P.W. (44) 18 approved at the A.P.W. (44) 4th Meeting, Minute 4.
government court, which would deal with the offence committed by the other partyto the attempted marriage, but separately by an appropriate military tribunal.It is felt that the inconvenience of separate trials in these matters is outweighed by the undesirability on policy grounds of members of the Allied Forcesappearing in the military government courts. The latter courts should be reserved for proceedings against the civilian population. A decision on theselines would mean that W.R.N.S., British merchant seamen and at any ratecertain members of U.N.R.B/.A. would not be liable to trial by court at fall; but itis felt that this position must be accepted.13. The amendments to the present text of the proposed law, in order togive effect to the points dealt with in paragraphs 7, 10 and 12 above, are shownas a footnote to Annex II.Conclusion.14.   It is accordingly recommended that-(i) It is desirable, as part of the policy of non-fraternisation, that duringthe operational period marriages in occupied Germany between members of the Allied Expeditionary Forces and enemy nationalsshould be prohibited, and that action should be taken to promulgatesuch prohibition and invalidate marriages contracted in defiance ofit by the local law.(ii) Marriages in occupied Germany during the operational period between members of the Allied Expeditionary Force and persons other thanenemy nationals, or with enemy nationals also possessing a dualnationality, should be permitted with the written authority of theSupreme Commander or those authorised to that effect by him.(iii) It is desirable to continue in Germany during, at any rate, the initialyears of the Control Commission period, the policy in (i) and (ii) above.(iv) A similar policy should be applied in Austria during the operationalperiod, but the desirability of continuing it during the Allied Corn-mission period in that country should be reserved for separate con-sideration nearer the time,(v) The policy proposed should be applied to the personnel of U.N.R.R.A.and other international organisations and agencies during the operational and Control Commission periods in Germany and duringthe operational period in Austria.(vi) The text of the proposed law at Annex II should be accepted, subjectto the amendments shown in the footnote to that Annex.(vii) If the above recommendations be approved, both the Dominions andthe Allied Governments concerned should be consulted in regard tothem before the proposed law is promulgated, consultation with thelatter taking place through the S.H.A.E.F. missions to the Govern-ments concerned.(viii) After the consultations with the Dominions and Allied governments have been completed, the necessary action should be taken to ensurethat the Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean Theatre, is requested to promulgate a comparable law in those parts of Austriaoccupied by the forces under his command, and that a draft directivebe prepared for consideration by the European Advisory Commission. laying down the policy to be followed in Germany as regards themarriages in question during the Control Commission period.(Signed) F.

ANNEX I.Memorandum by the Attorney-General on a Discussion on a DraftS.H.A.E.F. Military Government Order dealing with Marriage with members of the Allied Expeditionary Force.Attended by General Betts.Sir Thomas Barnes, Treasury Solicitor.Colonel H. A. Smith, 21 Army Group.Sir Henry MacGeagh, Judge Advocate-General.,Colonel W. B,. Osmond, Judge Advocate-General&apos;s Department.Captain E. H. Graveson, S.H.A.E.F., G-5 Division.Sir M. Millar Craig, Lord Advocated Department.Mr. G. P. Coldstream, Lord Chancellors Office.I attach the Draft Military Government Order,* and also a draft whichwas submitted by Colonel H. A. Smith, as Legal Adviser in 21 Army Group.t1. It was generally agreed that there was power in the military authoritiesto prohibit marriages with &quot;other persons&quot; and to make such a marriage an offence for the parties and for anyone concerned in celebrating or havinganything to do with it. There was discussion as to whether there was power ina Military Government Law or Order to invalidate such prohibited marriages if in fact celebrated in accordance with German law. The draft submitted by21 Army Group proceeded on the basis, that there was no power to invalidatesuch a marriage, and that the provisions of paragraphs 5 and 6 of the draftS.H.A.E.F. order were ultra vires. General Betts expressed the view that therewas power to invalidate as well as to prohibit. I had myself originally some doubts on this point, but in the result I agreed with the view expressed byGeneral Betts, and I think it can be supported on the ground of security,reinforced if necessary by another more general ground which I set out below.There is no doubt that in the circumstances which exist and are likely to exist in Germany an Order against fraternisation and association with the local inhabitants can be justified on normal grounds as necessary or expedient for thesecurity of the troops. There is, among other reasons, a substantial possibilityof the Germans seeking to employ women to try to obtain information. Althoughon the assumption that if a prohibited marriage took place steps could be takento prevent any association between husband and wife, there is a good deal to besaid for the view that a power to prohibit association must carry with it thepower to prevent the legal status of marriage being created. There is the furtherfact that, if the marriage was valid, at any rate so far as our law was concerned,the wife would have acquired British nationality, which might be very undesirablenow and hereafter on security grounds. The other ground on which I thinkparagraphs 5 and 6 of the Draft can be supported is as follows :    .On the view taken in this country, and also, I understand, in the UnitedStates, an Occupying Force does not become subject to the local law except to theextent to which the Military Commander agrees that it should. I should have thought, therefore, he was entitled to make Orders providing that the localmarriage laws are not to be applicable to members of his Forces. For these reasons am of opinion that what is provided in paragraphs 5 and 6 can validly be done.I also think that if paragraphs 5 and 6 were omitted there might be substantialdoubts as to what was the intended effect of the Order with regard to validity.Speaking generally, a marriage in order to be recognised as valid must, apartfrom other matters, be celebrated in accordance with the local forms. It mightwell be argued that a marriage celebrated in contravention of a lawful prohibi-tion was invalid on this ground, and doubts might well be raised as to the effects of the Order. If there is power, therefore, as I think there is, it is desirable thatthe Order should clearly state that such marriages will be regarded as invalid.2. If purported marriages take place and any question is raised as to theirinvalidity, it may be necessary to consider hereafter whether steps should betaken to put the matter beyond doubt. When full authority is assumed over germany, either by surrender terms or otherwise, it may be that some general provision validating orders previously made by military authorities will bepromulgated or enacted.* Not reproduced.   revised text at Annex II.f Not reproduced.
3. So far as German law is concerned, Colonel Smith said that the only legalmarriage in Germany was by declaration before a Registrar. Religiousceremonies were held in many cases, but in no case could there be a valid marriagewithout proceedings before the Registrar. Articles 1 and 2 of his draft were based on this legal position. Article 3 will not, I think, arise on the basis thatthe marriages are in law invalid. Colonel Smith had only seen the draft military government Order on the morning of the discussion, and if he had any points on the draft it Was arranged that he should make them direct. General Bettshas given me a suggested redraft of paragraph 1 which reads as follows : *&quot; No marriage shall be celebrated in the occupied territory of Germanybetween any member of the Allied Expeditionary Force and any person nota member of such a Force.&quot;This, as will be seen, omits the provision about written authorisation, as itis thought that this can wait until it is seen whether it is desirable in any case to permit such marriages.With regard to the rest of the draft&apos; I have no comments, except to suggest a redrafting of paragraph 6. The words I have used seem to me more inaccordance with the principle referred to above as to the non-applicability oflocal law to Occupying Forces : \&quot; 6. This law shall constitute part of the law of the occupied territoryrelating to marriage, and provisions of German law in relation thereto arehereby declared inapplicable to the extent necessary to give effect tothis law.&quot;If the amendment to paragraph 1 is accepted, there will have to be conse-quential amendments of paragraph 9, which at present refers to British or UnitedStates members and not to all members of the Forces.(Initialled) D.
