THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 148,8th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.FORESTRY BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland.1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the House of Commons onthe 15th February that, as a first step towards a larger and more comprehensiveforestry policy, the Government had decided to introduce in the immediate future legislation to transfer responsibility for forestry to the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Forestry commission is to be retained as a single continuing expert body responsible directly to ministers for advice on policy and for carrying out operations, including training,research and the management of forest holdings. The Commission will in thefuture, as in the past, be appointed by the Crown.2. A short Machinery Bill to bring about these changes was approved bythe Legislation Committee at its meeting on the 27th February (H.P.C. (45)8th Meeting), and we were asked to seek the approval of the War Cabinet for theintroduction of the Bill into the House of Commons at an early date.3. The Bill as a whole is not likely to provoke much opposition. The two main grounds of criticism are likely to be : (a) The fact that it is only a Machinery Bill and that nothing is said aboutthe promised expansion of forestry policy in the post-war period.(b) The fact that the exercise of powers for the compulsory acquisition ofland is in the hands of the appropriate Minister subject only to thesafeguard of a local enquiry to be held by him where objections areraised and not withdrawn.4. The reply to the first criticism has already been given on behalf of theGovernment by the Minister of Economic Warfare in the House of Lords on the20th February in the Debate on &quot; Post-War Forestry.&quot; He pointed out that itwas necessary in the first instance to transfer responsibility for forestry policy tous so that we might have constitutional authority for the formulation of a singlepolicy for land use that will give the nation a rapid expansion in its forests, with full consideration for hill sheep farming and other branches of agriculture, and matters of planning and amenity. We shall then be able to announce in due course the main lines of post-war forestry policy as affecting both State forestsand private woodlands.5. As regards the second criticism we do not expect opposition to theretention of the powers now held by the Forestry Commission for the compulsory acquisition of land for forestry purposes as we think it will be agreed that theexistence of such powers is essential to the proper development of forestry and agriculture, especially having regard to the rapid expansion of forestry that is contemplated. We recognise that every opportunity must be given to the interested parties to state objections and have them heard. We think it right, that, subjectto these safeguards, we should have the final decision in this matter because weshall have the constitutional responsibility for reconciling the interests of forestryand agriculture in fulfilment of the national policy of using land for the purpose for which it&apos;is best suited. The Minister of Town and Country Planning will,of course, be consulted on questions of amenity.[29385]4Copy No.
6. Under the procedure proposed (Clause 4 (3), Clause 5 and Parts and III of the 1st Schedule), the appropriate Minister must (a) Publish in a newspaper and serve on the owner and occupier a noticestating that an Order is to be made, giving particulars.(&amp;) If an objection is made, hold a local enquiry. Thereafter, the decisionof the appropriate Minister shall be final and he may make the Orderwith or without modifications. &quot;The Order shall have effect six weeks after the publication of the announcement that the Order is made,unless the validity of the Order is contested by an application to theHigh Court.The Compulsory Powers for which we ask would be subject to the usualexceptions, namely, ancient monuments, private dwelling-houses or parks, orcommons (to which Provisional Order Procedure must be applied).7. We consider that this procedure gives ample opportunity for theprotection of the interests likely to be affected. If, however, during the courseof the bill&apos;s passage through Parliament a demand arises for some kind of appeal from the Ministers decision, it may be desirable to provide Parliamentarysafeguards. In this event we would consider the possibility of applying the newProvisional Order procedure of the Statutory&apos; Orders (Special Procedure) Bill,referred to by the Prime Minister in the House on the 20th June, 1944, and thesubject of Memorandum H.P.C.
