Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. I       Copy No.W.P. (45) 176. /19th March, 1945. %WAR CABINET.OUTPUT AND LABOUR IN THE HARD COAL-MINING INDUSTRYIN GREATER GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.&apos; Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.I think it may be of interest to my colleagues to be able to compare the UnitedKingdom statistics with some figures of the German output and labour force inthe hard coal-mining industry, based on captured German official figures whichhave been supplied to me by the Minister of Economic Warfare.2. 1937-44-Hard coal output in Greater Germany rose considerably during the seven years ended March 1944. This increase was achieved partly through the annexation of coalfields, such as Polish Upper Silesia which were previously notworking to capacity and partly through the employment of an ever-increasingquantity of forced foreign labour. The steady augmentation of the labour force was at the same time successful in maintaining output throughout the rest of greater Germany at approximately its pre-war level.3. Output.In 1937-38 Germany&apos;s hard coal output was 185-1 million tons. In 1943-44the output of all the territories then comprising Greater Germany was 264 million;but a considerable proportion of this came from territories which were incor-porated into the Reich during the course of those seven years. In 1937-38 these territories produced the following tonnages : Million Tons.Polish Upper Silesia (and adjoining basins)      36-0Olsa district of Czechoslovakia      ...       ...        7-2Lorraine ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        6-2Austria and Sudetenland      ...       ...       ...        2-151-5Thus the real increase in German output was one, not of nearly 80 million tons, but of less than 30 million or about 11-6 per cent.Table I.Hard Coal Output 1937-43 in the United Kingdom and in Greater Germany.(Thousand long tons.)Coal Year.&quot; 1937-38   ...... 1938-39   ... 1939-40   ... 1940-41   ... 1941-42 1942-43 1943-44	United Kingdom.

From Table I, which compares German output (including that of the annexedterritories) with that in the United Kingdom, it will be noted that in the latteroutput over the same period fell by more than 20 per cent.It should, however, be appreciated that the very fact of this large-scaleacquisition of foreign coalfields has made the German problem a wholly differentone from that facing the United Kingdom. In the German coalfields properlyso-called including the Ruhr, which in 1944 was still responsible for something like half the whole Greater German output production has not been increased;on the balance, indeed, it has fallen by several million tons.The whole of the additional 30 million tons may, in fact, be said to have comefrom one area the non-German districts of the Upper Silesian coal basin. Inthese, production was nearly doubled, rising from 43-2 million tons in 1937-38to 75 million tons in 1943-44.Various subsidiary factors helped to render possible a rapid expansion ofproduction in this area. Many of the seams are new and comparatively easy towork, often being; from 10 to 50 feet thick.   Moreover, the close restrictions on&apos; o ....Polish coal exports due on the one hand to the prohibitive tariffs that barred it from its natural markets in Germany, and on the other to the Anglo-Polish CoalAgreement of 1935 (renewed in 1937) meant that in the immediate pre-war years the Polish coal industry was not working to anything like its full capacity.4. Labour.It is certain, however, that the real key to the German achievement, not onlyin stimulating output so remarkably in Silesia, but also in maintaining it close tothe pre-war level in the Ruhr, was the steady augmentation of the number ofworkers employed. Table II shows that between March 1938 and February 1944the total number employed in the hard coal industry in Greater Germany(including surface as well as underground workers) was increased by more thanone-third, as the result of an influx of forced foreign labour.The -Table also shows the stages by which this influx was effected, and the detailed changes in the composition of the labour force. By December 1943 morethan 27 per cent, of the labour in Upper Silesia was &quot; foreign &quot; (and this figureexcludes between 50,000 and 80,000 indigenous Polish and Czech workers), andin the Ruhr nearly 38 per cent. About one-fifth of the total labour force in bothareas consisted of prisoners of war.Table II.Greater Germany.Date.	Prisoners of War.	Other Foreign Labour.	German and Indigenous Workers.	Total.

Output per man shift.Table III indicates that in Upper Silesia output per man shift fell by 14 percent, between 1937 and 1943, while in the Ruhr the drop was one of 22 per cent.These figures compare with a falling off of less than 10 per cent, in this country.In Table IV it will be seen that the output per man shift in the two mainGerman coalfields decreased at the time when the proportion of German workers employed was dwindling.

Sunday and Holiday Working.From the middle of 1942 onwards an appreciable percentage from 6 to 8 percent. of output was raised by compulsory shifts worked on two Sundaysper month and on certain public holidays. It is impossible, however, to assessexactly how this practice affected either output per man shift or annual production as a whole.G. LL.
