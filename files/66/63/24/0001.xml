THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1945.SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (45) 169.lUh March, 1945.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-FRENCH FINANCIAL AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. -1. As the result of discussions which took place between representatives ofthe British and French Treasuries in December, and further discussions recentlyheld in London, a draft Anglo-French Financial Agreement has been drawn upwhich the French Cabinet have considered, and would be willing to accept, subjectto one technical point which is outstanding.2. Our first object in the negotiations was to reach a technical MonetaryAgreement on the same lines as that concluded with Belgium. But I felt that itwould be right to negotiate at the same time for a payment to be made in goldby France to this country, since we shall end the war with inadequate gold reserves and very large external liabilities, while France will end the war with herconsiderable reserves of gold and foreign exchange almost unimpaired and no substantial external liabilities. The draft Agreement provides that we shallobtain gold from France under two headings. In the first place if, as is probable,the French buy from us more than we buy from them during the current year,a part of the difference will be settled in gold. The gold which we shall be entitledto receive under this heading will be one-third of the value of the payments madeto us by France for current supplies, &amp;c. Under the second heading we shall receive in gold or dollars $158 million, equivalent to  39 million. When Francecapitulated in 1940 we took over the French munition contracts in the UnitedStates, and paid over in dollars to the account of France the dollar payments which the French had already made in respect of the munition contracts prior tothe date of their capitulation. The arrangements thus made in 1940 will, underthe draft Agreement, be reversed in the sense that the French will repay us the$158 million and we shall supply the French with materials, equipment and installations which we have produced for war purposes and which will be surplus to our requirements, to a value of  45 million on the basis of original cost lessdepreciation.3. The sterling to which the French will be entitled as the result ofrequisitioning balances and property owned in this country by residents inFrance, and as a result of the payment of certain claims clue by us in respect ofthe past, will be used to meet the probable deficit which will result from theFrench buying more from us than we shall buy from them in the current year, in sofar as this deficit is not met in gold as described above. For the rest, any surplusbalance of sterling accruing to the French from these past transactions will notbe disposed of except by agreement between the two Governments.4. The agreement provides for the cancellation of all claims on both sidesarising out of the war, other than those which are specifically dealt with by theprovisions of the Agreement.5. The only point which calls for comment in the technical Financial Agreement concerns the rate of exchange. We do not want to embarrass the Frenchby suggesting that this is likely to be altered, nor to embarrass ourselves byseeming to regard it as unlikely to be altered. The wording adopted is : &quot; Theofficial rate (at present francs 200 ^ l) may only be modified after mutualconsultation.&quot;T        Ao . a.Treasury Chambers,lQth March, 1945.[29436]
