THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNK3 MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March, 1945.SECRET./Copy NooOf-W.P. (45) 185.15th March, 1945.war CABINET.ADMISSION OF WOMEN TO THE FOREIGN SERVICE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN February 1942 I informed the Woman-Power Committee that I would consider after the war &quot; the appointment of a committee, which would not be confined in its composition to members of the Civil Service, to consider thequestion&quot; of the admission of women into the diplomatic and consular services&quot;in the light of the existing circumstances.&quot; I recently received a letter fromthe Chairman of the Cambridge University Women&apos;s Appointments Board,submitting that to leave the examination of this question until after the termina-tion of hostilities might debar women who had served in the war from competingin the reconstruction examinations. I have told her that the question is underconsideration.2. I have an open mind on the general subject of the admission of womeninto the Foreign Service, but, if they are to be admitted, I certainly think thatit would be a pity if women who had served in the war, and whose charactershave been tried out and formed by responsible war work, should be unable to compete in the reconstruction examinations. Moreover, I cannot help thinking that any delay in setting up a committee, which would have the result of excluding these women, would be very badly received by the women&apos;s organisa-tions. I would propose, therefore, to take immediate steps to set up a committee composed of two women representing, so far as possible, unbiased women&apos;s viewson this subject, and two members with experience of Foreign Service workabroad, with a High Court judge as chairman. I think that such a committeeis best designed to give us an unbiased opinion on this vexed question, and i hope that its composition is such that its conclusions, whatever they were, wouldbe generally accepted.3. It has been represented to me that any committee examining thequestion, either now or after the war, is bound to recommend the admission ofwomen to the Foreign Service, that there is therefore no need for a committeeand that we may as well take such credit as we can by deciding to admit them without having the matter examined by an outside committee. I feel, however,that in a question of this kind it would be undesirable to take such a step without first reinforcing ourselves by the recommendations of an impartial committee.A. EForeign Office, 15th March, 1945.
