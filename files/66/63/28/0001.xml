THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT138Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 173.11th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.Copy No.    35TRADE UNION REPRESENTATION AT SAN FRANCISCO.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT the recent World Trade Union Conference a Declaration was made onthe Trade Union attitude to the Peace Settlement, paragraph 31 of which statesthat the Conference &quot; resolves to seek from the Three Allied Governments anundertaking that accredited representatives of the Trade Union Movement willbe received into their Councils at the forthcoming San Francisco Conferencein an advisory and consultative capacity.&quot;2. During the course of the informal luncheon which I gave to Sir WalterCitrine and his principal Soviet, American, French and Chinese trade unioncolleagues, and to the Soviet, United States, French and Chinese Ambassadors,at the Fo7^eign Office on the 23rd February, Sir Walter interpreted paragraph 31of the Declaration as meaning &quot; that the three Allied Governments should haveTrade Union representation on their delegations at the San Francisco Con-ference,&quot; but he made it plain that the inclusion of a political representativeof Labour as such on the British delegation would not suffice. What he seemedto have in mind was the attachment of a leading trade unionist from each ofthe five convening States to their respective national delegations. At the Con-ference, however, these trade union representatives would work together andexpress the &quot; solidarity of Labour view &quot; which transcended &quot; quarrels between governments.&quot; On the other&quot; hand. M. Kuznetsoff, the Soviet trade unionleader, thought that there were two possibilities :  (i) Each individual Government should take into consideration the point ofview of its own trade union movement; and(ii) Representatives of the Central Government Body of the World TradeUnion Conference could themselves be present at San Francisco.3. The suggestion was made that the International Labour Organisationprovided a convenient means of expressing the trade union point of view; andthat it might be possible to arrange for the representation of the InternationalLabour Organisation at San Francisco. Unfortunately, neither the Soviet Unionnor the American C.I.O. are represented on the International Labour Organisa-tion, and they do not feel that their views can be properly expressed through it.It should, however, be pointed out that the American Federation of Labour is represented on the I.L.O., and that this is a body through which the UnitedStates Government have hitherto arranged for the representation of AmericanLabour.4. Summing up the luncheon discussion, I laid down three principles asfollows :  (i) Each Government would do all it could to carry all sections of its ownpopulation with it.(ii) The responsibility for decisions lay with the Governments. No Govern-ment could go to the Conference unless it felt that it was trulyrepresentative of the nation. Consequently, there should be nodistinction between Governments and organisations.(iii) The problem accordingly was to set up the right kind of consultativemachinery, both in regard to political and&apos; in regard to economic questions. k12711   [29442]
5. So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government is concerned I think we should takethe following line : (i) The purpose of the San Francisco Conference is to reach agreement onthe Charter of the new Organisation. This is essentially a matter for Governments and there is no case for the representation of unofficial bodies of any kind. If the trade union movement as suchwas invited to send representatives, we should find it difficult to refuserequests from employers&apos; organisations, Chambers of Commerce, andother bodies. I understand that the Minister of Labour and NationalService has already received representations from Sir John ForbesWatson asking that if the trade unions are officially invited toSan Francisco, employers&apos; associations should be similarly invited.(ii) We should favour the attendance at San Francisco of the NegotiationsCommittee of the I.L.O. Governing Body for the purpose of consultation.(iii) We are sending a delegation to San Francisco which includes a leadingrepresentative of the political Labour movement in the person of theLord President of the Council, and it has been arranged thatMr. George Tomlinson. Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofLabour, should also attend. These delegates are unlikely to ovelook the interests of the organised workers; and we hope that other nationaldelegations will also include representatives of Labour.(iv) If, in spite of not receiving an official invitation, representatives of theWorld Trade Union Conference or of any other representative body&apos;   turn up in San Francisco during the course of the Conference, theyshould not be given any official status, but we should not oppose anI arrangement which commands general support for giving them anI      opportunity to present their views to the Conference in writing.A. E.Foreign Office, 17th March, 1945.
