THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.W.P. (45) 168.15th March, 1945SECRET.Copy No.WAR CABINET.ITALIAN CLAIMS AGAINST GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State fob Foreign Affairs.AT its meeting on the 9th January the War Cabinet discussed my memorandum W.P. (45) 3 on the subject of Italian claims against Germanyand authorised me to consider the matter further and again bring it before theCabinet if, on further consideration, I concluded that in the interests of general relations with the United States their proposal should be accepted.2. In the last month we have had to differ from the United States Govern-ment on a number of questions connected with our policy towards Italy in whichthey have been prepared to move somewhat faster than ourselves. During thediscussions in Washington on the new directive to the S.A.C., Mediterranean,on the functions of the Allied Commission in Italy, for example, the UnitedStates Government proposed that we should formally terminate the armisticeregime and replace the instrument of surrender by negotiated agreements withthe Italian Government, which, while relieving Italy of her enemy status,would have left many vital questions such as the disposal of the italian fleet and the colonies unsettled. This we could not agree to. There were alsovarious points in the new directive on which we had occasion to differ from theUnited States Government. Again, we had to restrain the United StatesGovernment from making what would have been a rather embarrassing state-ment on financial policy cowards Italy to two Italian bankers who have been inthe United States for the past few months, ostensibly on a fact-finding mission.Finally, there are recent official requests from the Italian Government for Alliedstatus in place of co-belligerency and for practical assistance in various forms,which are under consideration here with a view to joint discussions with theUnited States Government and on which it seems likely that we and the americans will hold divergent views.3. I have therefore decided to ask the War Cabinet to reconsider myrecommendation that we should agree with the proposal of the United StatesGovernment in the matter of Italian claims against Germany, subject of course to the stipulations in paragraph 4 of my memorandum of the 1st January. AsI stated in my memorandum, we can make it clear that we undertake no obliga-tion towards the Italians by accepting their claims for examination and I suggestthat this is a case in which to meet the United States Government would causeus no barm. On the other hand, to add another item to the list of our refusalswould only tend to heighten the impression which is prevalent in Washingtonthat his Majesty1 s Government and the United States Government holdfundamentally different views on the matter of policy towards Italy. It cannotbe in our interests that such impressions should gain ground.A. E.Foreign Office, 15th March, 1945.12705   [29434]
