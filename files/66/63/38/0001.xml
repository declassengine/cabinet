THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT O n -I----------.----------------------------,--,---&amp; &amp; JLPrinted for the War Cabinet,  March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 183.21st March, 1945.WAR CABINET.CHANNEL  ISLANDS:   PROPOSED WARNING  TO  THE  GERMANCOMMANDER.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Minister of State.THE War Cabinet at their, meeting on the 6th March (WM. (45)26th conclusions, Minute 9) invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to consider whether a warning should begiven to the German Commander in the Channel Islands that, if he persisted inhis proposal to neglect his obligations towards the civil population, he and anyof his officers concerned would be liable to be added to the list of war criminals.The question arises as to the extent to which the German Commander is entitled to make use of civilian stocks and production for the maintenance ofthe German garrison. Under Article 52 of the Hague Land Warfare Regulationsattached to Hague Convention 4, an Occupying Commander has the right to demand requisitions in kind from the inhabitants of the occupied areas for the necessities of the Army of Occupation. Such requisitions must be in proportion to the resources of the country.The interpretation and application of this Article may cause a Commanderconsiderable difficulty in deciding how to distribute the available resources ina just proportion between the civilian population and his garrison who may becalled on to engage in battle at any moment. The German Commander wouldnot be entitled to ignore his obligations to provide for the civil population, nor would he be justified in satisfying the needs of the German Garrison before making any provision for the civil population. On the other hand, it wouldappear, in view of the Convention, that if the demands on the Islands&apos; resources are kept within reasonable limits he could not be held to be a war criminal.The information in our possession is based on a report from the International-Red Cross delegates who visited the Islands, dated the 15th January. There isno evidence at present that the German Commander had up to January 1945taken more than a reasonable share of the Islands&apos; resources for the maintenanceof his garrison. We understand that the German Commander has encouraged the civil population to grow more food and has refrained from exporting any ofthe Islands&apos; pedigree herd; and we have no information that he has acted other-wise than correctly in the disposal and distribution of Red Cross parcels to thecivil population.The Foreign Office have already informed the German Government throughthe Protecting Power that His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that so long asia German garrison remain in occupation of the Islands, the German government must be held responsible for feeding the civil population, and that if they areunable to fulfil this duty the garrison should surrender. The local civil authoritieshave also reminded the German Commander of his obligations towards the civilpopulation, calling his attention to Article 52 of the Hague Regulations mentionedabove, but the German Commander replied that &quot; the besieger alone bears theresponsibility for his compatriots in the case of fighting activities,&quot; and said thatthe German Army does not build fortifications without holding them with thegreatest bitterness and until the exhaustion of its powers of resistance. &quot; Eventhe advent of a calamity for the population after some time, for which the besiegeralone will be responsible, will change nothing of the facts.&quot;[29476]Copy No.  3 5
If now the German Government were informed that the German commander in the Channel Islands would be treated as a war criminal even before there is evidence that he is putting a new policy into effect and is neglecting his duty to provide for the civilians, they could make a telling reply by referring to theoffer made last September by the German Government, and refused by us, thatwe should either evacuate the civil population from the Islands or send in supplies.It is a matter for speculation whether any threat made either to the GermanGovernment or to the German Commander will result in securing any fairerdistribution of food between the civil population and the German garrison. Onthe one hand, the view may be taken that to threaten the German Commanderbefore there is any evidence of criminal conduct on his part might exacerbatethe relations between the German garrison and the civil population, and mighttempt the Commander to take the line that he may as well be hanged for a) sheepas for a lamb. On the other hand, if he is a man liable to be influenced by intimidation&quot;-dation, such a threat might act as a deterrent if he were tempted to divert forthe use of his troops more than a reasonable proportion of the civilian supplies.It must not be overlooked, however, that if he is a mail of this character he isalso likely to be intimidated by the fear of reprisals on his relatives and friends in Germany, to say nothing of the action which may be taken against him locallyby Gestapo agents set to watch his activities.The question whether any warning should be given to the Germans as tothe use of the civilian supplies in the Islands was considered at a meeting ofrepresentatives of the Departments concerned, and it was agreed that if it were decided as a matter of policy that some warning should be given for the purposeof ensuring that the civil population receive a fair share of the local supplies,the best course would be to arrange for a warning to be conveyed privately tothe German Commander in the Islands. This course has been attended with success in Italy. A diplomatic protest through the Protecting Power is not likely to he effective, even if it could be assumed that it would be transmitted by the German Government to their local Commander.H. M.R. L.21st March, 1945.
