THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. / Copy No.W.P. (45) 174. \f-V!th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.BULGARIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN connexion with recent telegrams about the situation in Bulgaria, andthe Bulgarian Governments request for recognition as co-belligerents, I circu-late, for the information of my colleagues, the attached note on the character ofthe Bulgarian Government and in particular on the activity of the BulgarianCommunists.A. E.Foreign Office, 17th March, 1945.THE present Bulgarian Government assumed office shortly before the signa-ture of the Armistice in October last, and its composition has not since been altered. The Government represents a coalition called the Fatherland Front,composed of four parties, the Communists, Agrarians, Social Democrats andZveno. The Zveno party, to which the Prime Minister belongs, was originallymerely a group of reforming politicians who organised a coup d&apos;Etat in 1934.They were overthrown the following year and did not organise themselves intoa regular political party until about a year ago. In the Government, the Zveno,the Communists and the Agrarians have four representatives each, and the social democrats two.It is thought by our representatives in Bulgaria that if there were free elections the Communists would obtain at most 20 per cent, of the votes cast.In practice, however, the Communists have, by one means or another, obtainedvirtual control of the country. Several methods have been adopted by the communists to achieve their ends. They have obtained complete control over themilitia, formed from what were originally the partisans, and through them the communists in practice control the internal administration of the country. Thepower of the militia has been misused to intimidate, arrest and kill opponents of the Communists. The purge conducted by the National Court has been ruth-lessly applied to eliminate all those who were in any way connected with theprevious regime. Many of those who do not qualify for punishment underthe purge but who are yet opposed to the Communists, mainly members of theAgrarian and Social Democratic parties, are being gradually eliminated or reduced to silence by intimidation. The Communists have also been able, bythreats and intimidation, to secure the nomination of their own puppets to manypositions of authority in the Agrarian and Social Democratic parties so thatthey can now be assured of the official support of these parties in any actions theymay take. For instance, Dr. Dimitrov, who was Chairman of the Agrarian party,was recently compelled to resign and was replaced by a Communist nominee Petkov. In the provinces, the Communists have in most towns and villages beenable to secure a predominant position on the local Fatherland Front Committees,which, with the aid of the militia, control the local administration. Finally,reports from Sofia show that the Communists intend to rig the forthcominggeneral election so that a Communist majority will be returned.12712   [29443]
In all this, of. course, the Bulgarian Communists have received greatencouragement and at least moral support from the Soviet authorities and fromthe presence of the Soviet army of occupation. Their task has also probably been eased by the absence at the front of a great part of the regular army, whichmight, in normal circumstances, have intervened to check the power of the militia,the mainspring of the Communist power.In practice, therefore, it seems that the situation in Bulgaria is not very different from what it is in Roumania, although outward appearances have been better preserved and there has been no obvious imposition on the country of a minority Government.Vlth March, 1945.
