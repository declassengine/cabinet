(45) 191.24th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.COMBINED SUPPLY REVIEW.Note by the Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister I circulate his directive to the Ministerof Production for the forthcoming review of the general supply position in washington.&apos; .(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2Uh March, 1945.Directive to the Minister of Production.1. You will proceed to the United States of America with the Minister ofFood, to examine with the American authorities the general supply position. Ashead of the Mission, you will report direct to me or to the War Cabinet from timeto time as may be necessary. With reference to food in particular, the enquiry should cover the whole field, including all those matters mentioned in paragraph 2of my telegram T. 293/5 to the President.2. You should concert with the American authorities a plan for dealingwith the problem which is revealed by this examination both in the immediatefuture and for a further period extending at least to the end of 1945.3. In your negotiations you should make out the strongest case possible forthe retention of our reserves and for the maintenance of the food supplies to whichwe are entitled.4. You should make it clear that we will not be behind any nation inimposing sacrifices on our people, but you should lay stress on the British sacrificesin the five years since rationing was set up and should also state, though notinvidiously, the food consumption in the United States.5. You should emphasise the dangerously low level our stocks will reach onthe existing programme, and point out that further depletions would not in anycase make any appreciable difference to the world supply. (For example, a 10 percent, cut in our end/1945 meat stocks would only throw up 70,000 tons as corn-pared with a deficit of 1,400,000 tons.) You should say that if it comes to aquestion of cutting our food reserves below the minimum safety level, or making further cuts in our rations, we shall have to choose the iattei&apos;.6. You should not begin your negotiations on the basis that the claims ofthe Services and the demands of S.H.A.E.F. for the liberated areas are irreducibleand that a further cut in United States consumption is inevitable.   You should[29499]
rather suggest that since the Americans have now cut their consumption and since we cannot cut ours further, it would be proper to scrutinise the other demands instead of assuming that the British and American civilians must bear the brunt.7. You should draw attention to the immense quantity of meat demanded by the American and British Armed Forces (including for German and italian prisoners), and not fail to point out that the mere increase in Service demandsthis year amounts to over one-third of the total United Kingdom civilian con-sumption. You should press most strongly for an enquiry as to the numbersof soldiers to be fed, the appropriate ration scales, and the stocks held by theServices, and you should offer to subject ourselves to exactly the same scrutiny.You should dispute the - overriding priority of military needs and operations over food and essential raw materials, arguing that a reasonable overall cut inthese would not materially prolong the war and would provide the necessariesof life and the minimum ration for the civilian population, without which thewar cannot be carried on by the military men.8. While it is proper to state the official claims made by S.H.A.E.F. andother authorities, you should emphasise that these will have to be closely examined and that no overriding priority can be given to them as compared with minimumBritish supplies and reserves.9. The case for feeding displaced persons, prisoners of war, &amp;c, at Armyrates will have to be reviewed. We must maintain the view that any Germanwho chooses to surrender should not thereby acquire the right to receive fullArmy rations no matter what the cost to our civilians. The application of this principle should be limited only by possible repercussions on Allied prisoners inGerman hands.10. You should argue that the Russian claim of 550,000 tons of meat in1945, which would give 21 million people 1 lb. a week for a year, is not justifiable.In any case the basis of Russian claims for food has been entirely altered by theconquest by Russia of the richest food growing areas in Eastern Europe. the drafting of the Fourth Protocol may provide an opportunity for a general -*reduction.11.   You should make it clear that we place Germans in a lower category thanLiberated Nations.12. You should dwell on the loss of food supplies, particularly meat, fromthe Argentine, and make it clear that further cuts imposed by the present shortagemust set us free to make the best contract possible for the largest amount of meat, &amp;c.W.
