Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 185.22nd March, 1945.WAR CABINET. \RELEASE OF STAFF FOR ELECTORAL REGISTRATION OFFICERSAND  RETURNING  OFFICERS.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland.1. In order that adequate arrangements may be made efficiently to conducta General Election we consider it necessary to ask for Cabinet approval to a procedure for the release from the forces and industry of men skilled in electoral registration work who were previously in the employ of Registration or returning officers. Urgent representations have been received on this matter from theCounty Councils Association, the Society of Clerks of the Peace and the society of Town Clerks.2. The present position on this matter is somewhat anomalous. The WarCabinet have approved* arrangements for the early release from the forces, theCivil Defence Services and industry of recognised agents or organisers and of key staff of headquarters and regional officers of political parties. Such personswill, if possible, be brought home from overseas regardless of age or medical cate-gory. The early release of staff for Electoral Registration Officers and returning officers seems to us to be no less important than the release of Party Agents ifa General Election is to be carried through with any degree of efficiency, and itwould be difficult to justify any less liberal treatment for Registration Officersthan for Party Agents.3. The total number of key men whose services will be required will bevery small, but they are persons for whom it will not be possible to find substitutes,if the smooth running of a General Election is to be ensured.Accordingly it is proposed that the Home Office and Scottish Office should examine any application for the release of such persons from the forces, theCivil Defence Services and industry, for the purpose of undertaking workpi^eparatory to a General Election, and that in those cases where they are satisfiedthat the application is justified, it should be forwarded to the Ministry of Labourand National Service. On receipt of such applications the Ministry of labour would : -(a) In the case of persons in the forces, recommend to the Service Depart-ments that release should be.granted forthwith, subject to over-ridingmilitary considerations.(b) In the case of persons in industry, consider each application on its merits and arrange for release in the absence of exceptional considerations.A procedure on these lines would conform substantially to the arrangementsagreed by the War Cabinet for the release of persons who were previously full-time Party Agents, organisers and officials.4. In addition to the release of persons with specialised experience of electoral procedure, it will be necessary to ensure that the present severely depletedstaffs of Registration and Returning Officers are sufficiently reinforced to dealwith the very heavy clerical work involved in carrying through a General Electionunder present arrangements. This work has been considerably increased by thedecision to allow members of the forces abroad to vote by post. This will entailheavy extra work in connection with the filing and arranging of applications* W.M. (45) 12th Conclusions, item 5.[29487]
tI.Whitehall, S. W. 1,22nd March, 1945.to vote by post, the issue of postal ballot papers, and the checking of proxy votesagainst postal votes to ensure that two votes are not cast on behalf of any servicevoter.5. We accordingly ask that the Ministry of Labour be authorised to make all necessary arrangements to ensure that extra clerical assistance is forthcomingwhen required.6. These proposals we regard as the minimum necessary to ensure thatthere is no breakdown in the arrangements for holding a General Election; andwe are of the opinion that the proposals contained in paragraph 3 can be effectiveonly if the Service Departments and the Ministry of Labour are prepared toconsider applications to them for release in a very sympathetic spirit.7. We, therefore, ask the War Cabinet to approve the proposals containedin paragraphs 3 and 5 of this Memorandum.H. M.T. J.
