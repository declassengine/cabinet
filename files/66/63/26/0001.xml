THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 171.Ibth March, 1945.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES TO LIBERATED AREAS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council and Deputy PrimeMinister.IN accordance with the invitation of the War Cabinet (W.M. (45) 23rdMeeting, Minute 4) I visited last week France, Belgium and Holland in orderto review the situation with regard to the supply and distribution of food andother commodities. I held long conversations with French and Belgian Ministers,with officers of S.H.A.E.F. Main and 21st Army Group. I also had discussions with representatives of the S.H.A.E.F. missions to France, Belgium and theNetherlands and with the Dutch Commissioner for the liberated part of Holland.I visited Paris, Brussels, Antwerp, Walcheren Island, Maastricht and Aachen.I talked with a number of Belgian, French and Dutch nationals and observedwherever possible the condition of the people.It will be realised that in a space of six days it is not possible to gain morethan a general view of the situation and the conclusions arrived at must be con-sidered with this limitation in mind.. 2. I have set out my detailed observations and recommendations in thefollowing Annexes : I. Civil Affairs Supplies for Western Europe.II. National Government Import Programmes.III. Transfer of Responsibility for Civil Affairs Supplies from the Militaryauthorities to the National Governments.IV. Inland Transport.V. Coal and Power.VI. Enemy Occupied Holland.VII. Combined Machinery in London.In this note I am setting down briefly my general conclusions and the salientfacts of the situation.3. Broadly speaking, with the exception of certain areas in the south ofFrance, and certain large towns such as Paris, Lille, Lyons and Marseilles, thereis no absolute want. It must be recognised, however, that the standard aimed at,and not everywhere or always attained, is meagre, being limited to preventingdisease and unrest on a scale that would impede military operations. The positionis generally better in rural areas than in the towns, where the poorer sectionsof the population cannot supplement the rations. From such observation as i could make in the various places which I visited or passed through, the generalcondition of the people was fair and that of the children unexpectedly good inmany places. Outer clothing was certainly not worse than in this country,although boots are a difficulty in some areas.I understand that these general observations are confirmed by the reportsof medical officers. They are. in consonance with the views expressed to me by ministers and the military officers in charge of civil affairs.4.   There has been a steady improvement in the Transport situation, witha resulting better distribution.   Efforts are being made to deal with the black market, but as its development was a virtue during the period of enemy occupa-.tion its repression is difficult, especially with such a meagre ration.[29428] b
5. Broadly speaking, therefore, provided the supply programmes approvedby S.H.A.E.F. and the import programmes submitted by the French, Belgian and dutch Governments are forthcoming at the right time, the position can be held,but, as is pointed out in Annexes I and II, everything depends on prompt decision in Washington and effective procurement and transportation. The whole system is, however, precarious. There are practically no reserves in hand and the peoplelive from ship to mouth. I think that, considering the difficulties, the militaryhave done, and are doing, a good job, and that the machine is functioning with reasonable efficiency. The Governments of the countries concerned are improving their organisation and are prepared to take responsibility in a few months&apos; timefor the Civil Affairs programme and to incorporate it into their own import programmes, provided adequate shipping and supply priorities are carried overwith it.6. Less satisfactory is the progress made in setting going the economic life of the liberated areas. While the position with regard to transport, fuel and power has been improving there is still a great lack of raw materials. More-over, as the date of liberation recedes, it becomes politically harder to limit food imports to the S.IT.A.E.F. standard of 2,000 calories which is admittedlyinsufficient for a working population for any length of time. unemployment and under-employment are serious. In Belgium, in particular, where theindustrial plant is largely intact, there is strong pressure for the fulfilment ofthe National Import Programme. This aspect of the supply question is impor-tant from the point of view of priming the pump and so utilising availablelabour with a consequent reduction of the pressure upon our labour position.Small imports now will save much larger imports in the future. An obviousinstance is that of fertilisers to increase the home production of food, and oimaterials for the repair or manufacture of road and rail vehicles. The sooner thewheels of industry begin to turn in these countries, the sooner will our responsibilities diminish. It is altogether desirable, from the point of view ofnational stability, that the Governments should take full control of the national life subjeqt only to military needs. A particular example of the need of economicrehabilitation is that of the flooded island of Walcheren. If the materials forclosing the breaches in the dykes can be made available in good time 45,000 acres of valuable agricultural land can be saved. Failure here may mean the ruinof the island for a generation.7. In Annex VI I have dealt with the problem of German-occupiedHolland. The military implications of this are being considered by the Chiefsof Staff and S.H.A.E.F., but it is essential that the stocks in Holland required forimmediate relief, and in the United Kingdom for continuing the relief for aconsiderable period, should be made available. Failure to bring relief in timehere may mean a terrible disaster and the loss of a very large part of the DutchNation.8. In conclusion, I would say that S.H.A.E.F. are fully alive to the serious consequences of a failure to provide for the liberated countries of western europe, not merely up to the Civil Affairs standards, but up to the higher but still modest standards of the National Government Import Programmes. besides the human suffering, the chaos and disorder which would ensue would causegreat embarrassment to those in charge of military operations, and have serious political repercussions in Britain and America. It is, in my view, necessaryto make a great effort to get the authorities in America to appreciate that thesuccessful rehabilitation of the West European democracies is an essential partof our war aims.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,&quot; 15th March, 1945.
ANNEX I.CIVIL AFFAIRS  SUPPLIES FOR WESTERN   EUROPE.1. The responsibility of the military authorities for the provision ofsupplies to the civil populations of liberated countries is limited by their Directiveto a standard which will &quot; prevent such disease and unrest as would impedemilitary operations.&quot; The supplies to meet this standard consist mostly of food,together with relatively small tonnages of clothing, blankets and soap (petroleum products and coal are supplied from military stocks and are not included in thefollowing figures).2. The military authorities planned to bring in to Western Europe, fromD-day up to ,the 31st January, 1945, some 760,000 tons of civil affairs supplies, ofwhich 700,000 tons were food. In fact, some 460,000 tons were imported ofwhich 440,000 tons were food. The main reasons why only 60 per cent, of the planned imports were actually brought in were  (a) Antwerp was not opened until the 1st December.   Up to that timemaintenance of the armies had to be carried out over beaches or through minor ports, and it was impossible to allocate more thanrelatively minor tonnages to civil affairs supplies without seriouslyimpeding military operations;(b) The liberation of large territories took place at the harvest season whenfood was plentiful locally. To save tonnage this local food was usedwithout compensatory imports, which would have spread the localstocks more evenly throughout the year;(c) Larger stocks of enemy supplies were captured and handed over to civilian use than were originally anticipated.3. Up to the 31st January some 300,000 tons of these civil affairs supplieshad been issued.   (France-220,000Belgium-45,000; Holland-35,000.)(a) For France, no supplies were definitely promised except for the periodNovember to February, for which a target import programme was drawn up. Inoverall tonnage this target has been substantially met, but certain deficienciesstill remain to be made up in March and April. These deficiencies are princi-pally the commodities which are short all over the world, e.g., fats, milk and meatIn Southern France the population have subsisted entirely on imported foodwithout which a very critical situation would have developed. The big cities of paris, Lille, Lyons and Marseilles have been the blackest spots, but the situationis now fairly satisfactory.(b) In Belgium, the Government originally stated that no imports of food would be required before the 1st January. This proved to be incorrect, andissues had to be made in November and December. This depleted the stocksbeing built up for their January programme. In addition, the progress of operations added further to consumption requirements, and there was also a slipin shipping from the United States The position has been temporarily rectifiedby drawing on stockpiles being built up for other commitments, includingHolland, to the extent of 109,000 tons, but there are still substantial deficiencies in the Belgian programme.ip) In Holland, it has been necessary to issue imported food ever sinceliberation. In addition, stockpiles had been built up, both in Holland and theUnited Kingdom, for the relief of Western Holland (the B.2 area) which amountedto some 150,000 tons. It is partly from these stockpiles that the 109,000 tons hasrecently been drawn to help Belgium, and I entirely- endorse the urgent request from S.H.A.E.F&quot;. that the deficiency should be made good to the Holland stockpiles.I have explained in Annex VI the very serious position which is likely to arise in holland, and I consider that every possible stet) must be taken to mitigate theconsequences..4.   Although up to the 31st January only 60 per cent, of the planned civil affairs requirements were actually imported/ no serious disease or unrest hasoccurred in the liberated areas.   A full share of the credit for this undoubtedly[29428] B 2
belongs to the local people and authorities., but I think it can be fairly said thatthe military authorities have [satisfactorily discharged itiheir immediate and limited responsibility, in spite of very great difficulties of supply.5. The consumption last year, of local stocks in order to save imports hasdepleted stocks, both personal and national, so that at the present time they are practically non-existent and, as the end of the crop year approaches, the situationin the next 3 or 4 months will be critical unless large imports are brought in. this position is reflected in the large and rising food requirements from February to august 1945 shown in the chart at the Appendix. These run from 200.000in February up to about 600,000 tons in June, July and August, and total about,100,000 tons. For France, Belgium and Holland, they have been examined inrelation to the national import programmes with the Governments concerned, whostated that any reduction or delay in deliveries of these amounts would have mostserious consequences. In the case of Belgium and Holland, at least, I ampersuaded of this.6.   Allocation of and procurement sources for these food requirements havebeen agreed in Washington, with the following exceptions : (a) All August requirements.(6) Wheat requirement for Germany for June and July.(c) &quot; Working margin &quot; factor of 20 per cent, for June and July.(d) Large quantities of items in short supply for May, June and July.The deficiencies in allocations for (&amp;), (c) and (d) above amount to some575,000 tons,* and it is most urgent that allocations should be made and procure-ment sources agreed within a very short time if these essential requirements areto be met. To date, arrangements have been made for the importation of Marchand April requirements; the shipping programme for May is now being settled;and the special arrangements necessary to handle the June, July and Augustrequirements are being investigated. In general, the tonnages are expected tobe within port capacity, but in making the necessary arrangements there are two main difficulties :  (i) In order to ensure imports by the months required, it is essential thatrequirements should be approved and the sources agreed without delay.In addition to the period of some 2 months which is often required for examination of the figures in Washington, the calling forwardprocedure takes over 3 months.   Therefore, unless decisions on theGerman and other outstanding requirements for May, June and Julyare taken at once, there is little hope of it being physically possibleto import in the right months;(ii) The uncertainty as to what civilian supplies and shipping will be allocated to the National Governments.  Port capacity will be strainedto the maximum in the summer and unless the national import pro-grammes can be decided soon with some degree of accuracy it may befound, when the time comes, that there is insufficient port &quot;capacity to handle them.7. The figures for Germany are large. These requirements are to meet theneeds not only of German civilians (at a minimum standard) but also of very largenumbers of Allied or other non-German displaced persons (of whom the Russians,by the Yalta Agreement, must be fed at approximately 4,000 calories) and ofreleased Allied prisoners of war. I am very concerned at the prospect of con-ditions in Germany and their impact on the supplies for the Western Allies.General Bedell Smith is definitely of the opinion that conditions in Germany willbe chaotic. He expects to find German administration, both central and local,completely dislocated and no effective system of distribution. If events turn out this way, I foresee that the military authorities, whose interest and respon-sibilities will be mainly concerned with the security of the Allied troops inGermany, will demand that first priority, both in movement and. in quantity,&quot; for civil affairs supplies should be given to needs in Germany.   This is a situation515 000 Evaporated Milk   ...... 34,000* Wheat        ...                -    45*000 Dry Skim Milk      ...... 9,500^our:;-                                   7 000 Fa&apos;8 ............ 56,000B&apos;scults                                    I&apos;500 Rice............ 7,000 hf8e                                      7&apos;000 Canned Meat         ...... 31,000 ulses                                      9 000 Vit. Chocolate       ...... 17,000
which, in my opinion, may gravely prejudice the provision and delivery of essential supplies to France, Belgium and Holland during next autumn and winter which, from the point of view of food availabilities, are likely to be themost critical of the war.8. In the food requirements shown in the attached chart is included a 20 percent, working margin. Hitherto, there have been practically no civil affairsreserves on the Continent, and supplies have been distributed on a ship to mouthbasis. Figures in the past have been worked out on the basis that the lengthy andcomplicated machinery of assessing requirements, screening, procuring, callingforward and distributing would work to perfection. This procedure is bound tobreak down at various points (e.g., miscalculations, shipping losses, pilferingwhich is serious in France, the floods and frosts of this winter), and a basis ofperfection is one which no army would dream of relying upon for its warlike stores. I therefore regard is at essential that some working margin to allow foraccidents should be made, although perhaps 20 per cent, is asking for too much.In the past critically urgent needs for civil affairs supplies have sometimes been met from Army stocks, but I was informed that the progress of operations andthe lengthening lines of communication would make any further assistance of thiskind out of the question, at least in the area of 21 Army Group&apos;s responsibility.9.   My general conclusions are as follows :  (a) There has been no serious disease or unrest in the liberated territories and it can fairly be said that the military authorities have thereforedischarged their limited responsibility for civil affairs supplies. Thislimited responsibility is, however, quite inadequate for the pressingeconomic needs of our Western Allies which can only be met by national Import Programmes (see Annex II).(6) It is essential that that part of the 109,000 tons raided for Belgium fromthe Holland and other S.H.A.E.F. stockpiles should be replaced atonce.(c) The outstanding requirements up to July (i.e., 575,000 tons) should be approved and procurement sources settled forthwith. This should betaken up with Washington as a matter of urgency, otherwise therewill be little hope of the necessary imports arriving in the monthsrequired, and the consequences of this may well be starvation in some areas and serious unrest in all.(d) As events in Germany may develop so that the limelight is directed onto that country to the detriment of our Western Allies, the require-&quot;ments now put forward for France, Belgium and Holland should, afterapproval, be specifically earmarked for those countries only.   Nodiversion to Germany should be made without the approval of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.



ANNEX II.NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IMPORT PROGRAMMES.1 In addition to the supplies included in the &quot; Civil Affairs &quot; programmes of S.H.A.E.F., the French, Belgian, and Dutch Governments have all presentedminimum programmes of civilian import requirements which are intendedprimarily to rehabilitate industry as well as to supplement &quot; Civil Affairs &quot;supplies, and later to replace them entirely when supply responsibility is trans-ferred from S.ITA.E.F. to the National Government concerned.2. The salient figures for the first six months of this year are as follows(thousands of tons) :  Food.      Other Items.       Total.France ............      681 2,389 3,070Belgium and Luxemburg   ...       ...       124 968 1,092Liberated Holland.........        38 226 264843 3,583 4,426These programmes have been examined on the spot by Four Party Committees,including S.H.A.E.F., British, American and the National representatives, trans-mitted to Anglo-American shipping and supply authorities, and are now in course of fulfilment, so far as supply and shipping exigencies allow. Similarprogrammes for the second half of this year are in an advanced state of prepara-tion, and are naturally likely to be a good deal larger as industrial activitygradually revives.3. The programmes are drawn up on moderate and realistic lines andrepresent the least that can reasonably be considered necessary to restore a soundworking economy in the countries concerned, bearing in mind the exhaustion of stocks provided by the Germans, the dislocations of invasion, and the consequentlylow tempo of current industrial activity. There is no question yet of restoringpre-war standards; for example, the food standard adopted, when added to theCivil Affairs target of 2,000 calories, will still in all three countries be well belowcurrent British rations, and &quot; a fortiori &quot; much lower than those of the allied armies, German prisoners-of-war and displaced Russians. Apart from foodthese programmes are confined for the most part to industrial raw materials,machine tools, &amp;c, needed to get the wheels turning, not for normal peace produc-tion, but for the indispensable needs of modern communities anxious to play their part in the war effort.4. I was impressed during my interviews with both the French and BelgianMinisters (including the Belgian Prime Minister) by the frankness and self-respect which they displayed in exposing the needs of their countries, and bythe efforts they were making from their own resources to avert a breakdown, andat the same time play a fuller part in the war. They made no complaints either of ourselves or of the Americans, though the demands of the Armies involve aconsiderable drain on their own resources in such things as food, coal and trans-portation; they expressed gratitude for the efforts which we were already makingto help them; and they made no suggestion that our own consumption levels shouldbe reduced, though they referred pointedly to the difference between what we haveourselves maintained and their own more modest targets. It is worth adding that both Governments expect to draw on German resources of, e.g., coal, power and plant, as soon and as much as possible.5. All three programmes are matters of urgency, but the point of mostextreme urgency naturally changes from time to time. Thus a month ago theFrench were more anxious about transport for distributing food and coal suppliesthan about the supplies themselves, while the Belgians were more anxious for food than for transport equipment. At the present moment these positions are largely reversed. The transport situation shows some improvement in France,whereas the outlook for wheat, meat and fats between now and the next harvesthas grown much worse. In Belgium on the other hand the food position will betolerable if both military and civilian programmes are fulfilled a highly important proviso but the rise in coal production, a notable achievement sincethe new Government came to power, has increased the need for locomotives and railway wagons.
%6. The same general conditions apply to the Dutch as to the French and belgian Government programmes, but as the Dutch Government are still inLondon, I did not discuss during my visit their programme for the area alreadyliberated, except for the special case of the repair of the Walcheren dykesbreached by the R.A.F. Here I saw for myself the distressing effects of theflooding, as well as one of the largest of the actual breaches. It is urgently necessary that the breaches should be stopped by the 31st October at latest. Other-wise, the winter gales, added to the scour of the tides, which is already having an obvious effect, will make matters much worse than they are already, until the whole45,000 acres of cultivated land in the island is lost. Moreover, the longer the soilis exposed to salt water the longer it will take to bring back to cultivation. If, onthe other hand, the dykes can be restored before this winter, the water can besluiced away comparatively quickly, and it should be possible to plant rye nextyear.7. But the repair of the dykes depends on the supply of very hard stone fora foundation, and the amount required reaches the formidable figure of130,000 tons. Normally this would come from Scotland or even further off. under present circumstances it will have to come from Belgium, and the necessary arrangements for its transport should be put in hand without delay.8. It is vitally important for these programmes, and their successors for thesecond half of the year, to be fulfilled as fully and punctually as possible. As Ipassed through Maastricht, the inhabitants were celebrating the fact that sixmonths had already passed since their liberation; we must not lose any more timein priming the pump and getting these countries going, if we are to avoid an extremely ugly situation in Europe later on this year which would have deplorablepolitical results for ourselves. We have, indeed, much more positive advantages to gain, even in the short run, by laying off what essential production we can on thesehighly industrialised countries (though not at the expense of their own essential needs) and so relieving the strain on our own man-power. The French, for their part, should be discouraged from a premature building-up of such a large army as might seriously deplete the man-power required for agricultural and industrial production.9. Adequate priorities of supply and shipping are, however, essential toenable these programmes to be fulfilled. In view of the grudging attitude adopted,by the United States Chiefs of Staff (in spite of the Law-Hopkins Agreement andthe discussions during the Guinea Conference), the necessary shipping prioritiescan only be established by agreement at the highest level. As regards supplies, wehave to contend not only with American military prejudices against non-operational purposes as such, but with the hyper-sensitive American&quot;reaction toany proposal which might lead to a reduction in their own civilian standards offood and consumer goods.  These difficulties must be faced and overcome.10.   My recommendations are as follows :  (a) Everything should be done to secure adequate priorities of shipping and supply for national Government programmes (as established on the spot by the Four-Party Committee procedure) on the basis that theirfulfilment is an essential element in the war effort of the united nations.(b) A special directive should be issued for top priority to be given to thesupply and shipment of the materials required to repair the Walcherendykes sufficiently to keep out the sea this winter.(c) National  Governments should themselves be urged  to improve their internal arrangements for distribution and administrative controls.id) Both here and in Washington closer and more definite arrangements should be made between United States-United Kingdom shipping and supply authorities, on the one hand, and Allied Supply Missions onthe other, in order to establish supply programmes sufficiently far inadvance and tie them in with allocations of shipping,11. I deal with the special problem of (a) transport, and (6) coal and power,in more detail in Annexes IV and V below.
ANNEX III.TRANSEER OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL AFFAIRS supplies from THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES TO THE national governments.1. The Supreme Commander is anxious to hand over, at the earliest opportunity that military operations permit, to the National Governmentscomplete responsibility for taking care of those minimum requirements of the civilian populations which are now met by the military authorities as part of themilitary programme through civil affairs supplies. He considers that this stepis necessary and desirable not only from the point of view of national sovereigntyand prestige but also because it will combine under the National Governments(where it rightly belongs) the whole responsibility for supplying and rehabilitation-tating their countries. There are, however, two essential conditions required byS.ITA.E.F. before the hand-over can take place (i) The National Governments must be assured that sufficient food-stuffs and other essential materials will be available to meet their minimumneeds.(ii) The National Governments must receive firm and adequate shippingallocations to carry the goods.In addition, the National Governments will require from S.H.A.E.F. an under-taking that adequate port clearance and inland transport facilities will beavailable to them.2. In France, where the Interior Zone is already a French responsibility,it is planned to hand over the responsibility for the whole country, starting withMay deliveries. This will mean that the French will be responsible for shipping,in addition to their own programme (see Annex II, paragraph 2 above), the70,000 tons of foodstuffs in May and the 40,000 tons in each of the subsequentthree months, which are now planned to be brought in as civil affairs supplies in military shipping. S.H.A.E.F. pointed out, however, that a, large proportionof this tonnage would have been loaded as broken stowage in military ships carrying warlike stores. It will not, therefore, be possible for the militaryshipping allocation to be cut in favour of the French by anything like the full amount.   Adequate arrangements will have to be made to cover this gap.3. In Belgium, S.HA.E.F. and 21 Army Group are examining thepossibility of handing over the responsibility to the Belgian Government, startingwith the September deliveries. They do not consider an earlier hand-over islikely to be possible because Antwerp and the Belgian railways will be the mainlines of communication for the armies in Northern Germany and must therefore remain under complete military control; and also because the new BelgianGovernment must first show that it is competent to carry the full responsibilityfor procurement, shipment and distribution. I discussed this question withthe Belgian Ministers concerned, and although they are eager to take over this responsibility as soon as possible they fully realise that the special circumstances may delay the date of transfer, and they will not press for this until the militaryauthorities are satisfied that the time is ripe.4.   I consider that .(a) The transfer in France should take place on the 1st May, and that theUnited States authorities and S.IT.A.E.F. should be asked to agreespecifically to the conditions mentioned in paragraph 1 above.(b) The transfer in Belgium should be planned for the 1st September, butthat no action should be taken in London or Washington until adefinite recommendation is received from the Supreme Commander.ANNEX IV.INLAND TRANSPORT.1. I found that the general view of the military authorities was that existinginland transport facilities, together with the measures already taken or planned to improve them and to increase their equipment, would just suffice to meet[29428] k c
essential requirements so long as the main battle was west of the Rhine. But assoon as the armies moved in strength across the Rhine the situation was likelyto become very strained. It will take 2 or 3 months to build a railv/ay bridge intoNorthern Germany, and the resulting demand for road transport to supply the armies east of the Rhine will be enormous.2. S.H.A.E.F. (but not 21 Army Group) consider that transport facilities in Belgium are considerably better than in France. But it is worth recording that,in conversation, no French Minister but almost every Belgian Minister mentioned the need for improving inland transport.   (See Annex II, paragraph 5 above.)3. Railway wagons are operated as a single pool in France, Belgium and holland. There are available about 200,000 wagons against a total militaryrequirement of 300,000. But this figure does not include civil requirements. InFrance alone there were 450,000 wagons before the war. At present less than200,000 survive, of which only about a half are available for purely civilian purposes, though, of course, S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s wagons carry civil affairs as well asoperational supplies.4. Imports of wagons are being arranged, and a substantial amount of repair material is being brought in to enable local repair facilities to reconditionbroken-down wagons, but it will be a slow business building up to the full number required. France is very short of locomotives, and some have been borrowed from belgium where the position is easier. Stocks of railway coal have improved, andthere is no shortage of petrol for road transport.5. In France, where the railways and bridges had been severely damaged by bombing and sabotage before the invasion, a very creditable job in repair hasalready been done so that nearly all main lines and bridges have already been restored, although often only on a single-line track. Arrangements with theFrench seem to be satisfactory, and the latest figures show that 41 per cent, ofwagon loadings are on military account and 59 per cent, on French account.Transport of coal is now ahead of production, although there are still large stocks to be moved from the pitheads. There is a great shortage of vehicles for civilianroad transport and an even greater one of tyres, but arrangements are in hand for improving this. The French have been allotted 14,000 tons a day portcapacity, and this will be increased, but for the present lack of civilian shippingprevents its full use.6. In Belgium the transport system is much less damaged than in Franceand the country is very well served with railways and canals. The civilian road transport is crippled by lack of tyres, but arrangements have been made to repair and produce these locally, as well as to import them. The general position willbe considerably eased when the 3,500 barges, which are estimated to be available,have been registered and brought under organised control. At present these are all privately owned and the owners are proving somewhat recalcitrant.7. There is no doubt that, as the armies advance and lines of communi-cation lengthen, more and more French and Belgian rolling-stock will be drawneastwards just at the time when revived economic activity will increase theneed for them in their countries of origin. It is also certain that an acute shortage of all transportation equipment will be found in the B.2 area of Holland(see Annex VI below), and the consequent demands on French and Belgianresources will be great. I am not satisfied that the available road vehicles are used to the best advantage either in France or Belgium, as there is no road haulage organisation comparable with our own.8. My conclusion is that special efforts should be made to assist national governments to increase the efficiency of their inland transportation systems byany or all of the following means : (a) The supply of materials, components and plant required for their ownlocal production for themselves and their neighbours, including repair and maintenance facilities.(b) The supply of finished equipment from British and American production or of second-hand equipment under British or American civilian andmilitary control. A report on the measures taken or proposed onthese lines for France is now before the War Cabinet (W.P. (45) 134).I recommend that similar measures should be considered for belgium and in due course Holland.
ANNEX V.COAL AND POWER.1. France, Belgium and liberated Holland are all substantial producers ofcoal, but France normally needs large imports from this country as well. As with ourselves, production in all these countries is well below the pre-war scale, butheavy deliveries are, none the less, being made to S.HA.E.F. All coal imports arethe sole responsibility of S.H.A.E.F., and in view of the operational needs of therailways, must probably remain so even after the transfer of responsibility(Annex III above).2. I did not examine the position in Holland, but both French and BelgianMinisters had a good deal to say on the subject. The French complain, with somejustice, that they cannot go on indefinitely supplying S.HA.E.F. with twice asmuch coal as the military at present bring in. Local production in both countries has made an encouraging recovery from the low levels of last September, but with-out the assistance of the quasi-slave labour available to the Germans, is unlikely toreach high levels for some time. There are several factors retarding production,including too low a diet for sustained manual effort, inadequate clothing and foot-wear, and poor housing. These may be relieved in due course, but in the meantimehave a depressing effect on output. Distribution has also much improved, and the worst of the domestic hardships and discomforts of January and February arenow things of the past. On the other hand, things are by no means comfortable,the revival of industry is in real danger of being retarded for lack of coal,and it looks as though any large production for direct Allied war needs will be atthe expense of essential relief needs, unless coal is specially imported to make good what is so consumed. unless this point is watched there is a real danger thatAllied orders for war material will add to the economic and social difficulties nowbeing experienced. In some cases, there is a vicious circle coal cannot be trans-ported for lack of wagons, and wagons cannot be made for lack of coal.3.   I recommend accordingly that (a) The utmost endeavours should be made to increase local production ofcoal, and measures taken to supply pit-props and mining machinery,with the help of British and American resources, which should be madeavailable to the utmost extent practicable.(b) To this end, close co-operation should continue between the Solid FuelSection of S.H.A.E.F. and the British and American civilian agenciesconcerned with coal.(c) Consideration should be given to the possibility of supplying thesecountries with German coal as much and as soon as possible.(d) Meanwhile, it is essential that adequate supplies should be made avail-able from all practicable sources.4. The position in regard to electric power is broadly similar, though in.France the resources of the central Massif have already been brought to reinforcethose of Paris to a remarkably successful extent, and plans are being made toextend the Belgian grid to the B.2 area when we can get at the latter. My onlyrecommendation is that, as with coal, German power resources should be utilisedto the maximum for the benefit of France, Belgium and Holland.ANNEX VI.ENEMY-OCC UPIED HOLLAND.1. The position in occupied Holland is one of great gravity. In WestHolland, where there are between 3 or 4 million people, the Dutch population is on an extremely low standard of food and, according to all accounts, the deathrate is high. This is worst in the big urban centres. The Germans are sendingin limited supplies week by week and there are no civilian dumps. Except forsome of the country people, actual starvation would begin with the cessation ofthese supplies. With regard to Holland east of the Zuyder Zee in FriesLand,which is mainly rural, there has not been hitherto so much apprehension, but it ispossible that when the Germans leave they will remove what food they can find,while there is already some influx of population from West Holland and there is always the possibility of an irruption of displaced persons when the Germansleave. There is, therefore, in regard to Holland a short-term and a long-term problem.   The latter requires the building up of stocks for the sustaining of this
large population. The former is in effect that of how to bring immediate relief to 3 or 4 million people threatened with imminent starvation.2. Whether as we progress into Germany the Germans in occupied Hollandstand fast and fight it out, withdraw leaving sacrifice detachments at important points, or withdraw altogether, the problem involves something like a majorcombined operation, including actual fighting, unless the Germans choose the last of the three courses indicated. The Combined Chiefs of Staff have askedS.H.A.E.F. to prepare a plan as a matter of urgency. I have-asked the Chiefsof Staff to have full regard to the imaginative use for this Dutch rescue operationof the resources of all three Services, if necessary by the temporary diversion of;for example, bombers and flying boats on a massive scale. It is essential to brin^the fullest aid in the first few days; the effects of any loss of time at that stagewill be incalculable.3. The civilian supplies required for the rescue operation are food, medical and relief stores, and means of transportation and distribution. Food require-ments on the basis of 1 lb. per head per day have been estimated at 2,000 tons aday for 74 days. Stocks to this amount had been built up, partly in Free holland and partly in Great Britain. They have been heavily reduced by raiding forother purposes, particularly Civil Affairs demands for Belgium, but are now-being built up again. They consist, I understand, of normal food-stuffs canned meat, dried milk and so on. In addition, special packs of food-stuffs suitable forthe initial treatment of cases of starvation for a total of 20,000 people for three days will be ready by the end of this month. This provision is now being trebled.Medical and relief stores are also being accumulated, but 21 Army Group are finding difficulty in getting enough bridging material and other transportationequipment.4. Apart from this, the arrangements made so far have not got beyondplanning. In particular, no troops have yet been allocated to General Galloway;though large numbers will obviously be required for an operation of this sort, toestablish&apos;lines of communication, keep order and undertake actual distribution,quite apart from fighting Germans.5.   I make the following recommendations :  (a) The stockpiles for Holland both here and on the Continent should bebrought up to their planned level as soon as humanly possible.(b) Subject to the report of the Chiefs of Staff, General Galloway&apos;s demands for English-speaking troops and materials, as approved by S.H.A.E.F.,should be accorded priority second only to direct operationalneeds against Germany, and the special training for the troopsstarted at once. We should not hesitate if necessary to give absolute priority in certain cases such as the temporary use of the wholebomber force.(c) A special study should at once be undertaken by General Galloway inconjunction with civilian medical and welfare experts to cover thewhole field of the provision needed for the physical, social andpsychological conditions likely to be encountered.AXNEX VII.COMBINED MACHINERY IN LONDON.The Prime Ministers minute of instructions raised the question whether a combined Anglo-American Committee with some executive power should sit inLondon. Fundamentally this is so much a matter between us and the americans that I have thought it best not to deal with the matter here, but to defer it forfurther examination by Ministers. There is a strong &quot; prima facie &quot; case for sucha Committee but the United States representatives in continental capitals reportdirect to Washington, and this creates a difficulty. Judge Rosenman, however,is just beginning a lengthy tour of France and Belgium to investigateeconomic problems generally. On his return I propose that we should discuss thequestion with him. Meanwhile I suggest that the Foreign Secretary and theMinister of Production might consider together whether practical proposals canbe drawn up for the purpose of such a discussion.
