THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPEiC MAJES1Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 163.Uth March, 1945.J/WAR CABINET.FINANCE OF RELIEF.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.MY colleagues will remember that on the 25th January, 1944, in asking fora Vote of Credit I announced in the House of Commons the Government&apos;acceptance of the Resolutions passed by the first U.N.R.R.A. Council at AtlanticCity and stated that in accordance with the recommendation in those Resolutionsthat member countries should contribute one per cent, of a year&apos;s national incomethe United Kingdom contribution to U.N.R.R.A. would be  80 millions. I addedthat we should incur in addition a measure of expenditure on relief following-military operations before U.N.R.R.A. could come into operation.2. In the course of events this measure of expenditure outside the scope of u.N.R.R.A. has become very considerable and it will be recalled that lastAugust the Minister of State put forward proposals (W.P. (44) 459), withparticular reference to Italy, for sharing between the United States and UnitedKingdom the burden of this relief. These proposals have been the subject of much discussion with the&apos; Americans and Canadians with the result that thethree countries are assuming a liability for making available civil supplies inEurope outside the scope of U.N.R.R.A., for which payment cannot reasonably be expected from the recipient countries, up to a total of $400 millions, dividedamong them in the proportions of 67 for the United States, 25 for the UnitedKingdom and 8 for Canada. It is provided that when the limit of $400 millionslooks like being reached the three countries will consult together to considerwhether supplies can continue to be financed in this way. The accountingmachinery is complicated and precise figures of where we have got to are notavailable, but it is clear that we are already very close up against this limit,mainly on account of supplies to Italy.3. Besides our  80 millions contribution to U.N.R.R.A. and the foregoing 25 millions (25 per cent, of $400 millions) we have to bear in mind our obliga-tions for the relief and reconstruction of our Colonies, which will be very large.4. Against this background we have to consider the demands that may bemade on us for continued assistance in the field of relief which is at presentoutside the scope of U.N.R.R.A. The immediate problems arise over the suppliesthat continue to be necessary for Italy, whose demands will be increased whenthe north is liberated. The State Department has in fact recently asked uswhat ideas we have about the finance of Italy after the military period.5. The problem of Germany is outside the scope of this Paper, but we may shortly be faced with the question of necessary supplies for Austria, which Ithink can conveniently be considered in this connection.6. In view of the commitments we have already undertaken, as described in the first three paragraphs of this Paper, it is very difficult for us to take onany further obligations. It is not only, or perhaps primarily, a question of money,but of our capacity to make supplies available. It will not be easy for us to fulfil our contribution to U.N.R.R.A., 90 per cent, of which is to come, accordingto the recommendation in the Atlantic City Resolution, out of the goods and services of the United Kingdom and Colonies. We have also to remember when we get pressing demands for supplies for Italy that our Far Eastern Colonies, and burma, when they are liberated, will look to us to supply all we can to them.[29424;
7. In these circumstances our policy must clearly be to endeavour to bringas many as possible of the fresh demands that will be made on us within thescope of our existing commitments and to refuse to undertake additional commit-ments, except to the very limited extent to which we may be able to fulfil them.This means that we should make it our policy to do all we can to establishU.N.R.R.A. as the effective channel for all relief, since this is the best way of reconciling our position as partner with the United States on the one hand with,on the other hand, the great disparity in the present financial strengths of thetwo countries.8. I wish to seek, therefore, the agreement of my colleagues that we should instruct our Ambassador in Washington to approach Mr. Stettinius and explain to him our views on the foregoing lines. The particular proposals which heshould make would be that at the next Council Meeting of U.N.E.R.A., whichis forecast for May or June, the United States and United Kingdom should ensurethat the Administration^ scope is extended to enable it to undertake relief and rehabilitation in Italy and Austria, not necessarily, of course, on the samestandards as appropriate for Allied countries. He should also suggest that theprovision of any necessary supplies, once the $400 millions quoted above haveburden, should be financed in a manner more in accordance with the respectivefinancial strengths of the United Kingdom and the United States than the presentproportions of 87 for the United States and 25 for the United Kingdom. Theworking out of a plan under this head is bound to be complicated and I need not enter into details here. The essence of any plan should, I think, be that theUnited Kingdom would in future be financially responsible for procurement ofsupplies for which payment was not likely to be forthcoming only in the UnitedKingdom and Colonies.9. These proposals will, of course, increase the burdens on U.N.R.R.A. andare no doubt dependent for their success in the long run on the readiness of congress to vote an additional contribution to U.N.R.R.A. from the United Statesnot matched by further contributions from the United Kingdom. It is not,however, altogether unreasonable to hope that this may be possible. The proposalsalso postulate an U.N.R.R.A. capable of doing its job. I am aware that therehave been considerable doubts about the capacity of the present Administrationboth in our minds and. I believe, in those of the United States Government, butI suggest that this is rather a matter to be remedied, in so far as we can do anything, than a reason for not continuing to work through U.N.R.R.A.10. If my colleagues agree, I suggest that the Departments concerned shouldbe instructed to prepare suitable telegrams on the above lines to be sent to washington.been exhausted, which mustcan take over theJ.
