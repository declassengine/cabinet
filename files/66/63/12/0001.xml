F.S.M. (Argonaut) 1st Meeting.1st February, 1945.AGREED RECORD OF A MEETING HELD ON BOARD H.M.S. &quot; SIRIUS &quot;AT MALTA AT 10-30 a.m. TO 12 noon ON 1st FEBRUARY, 1945.Mr. EDEN asked Mr. Stettinius if there were any points which he wishedto raise.Mr, STETTINIUS said that he hoped it would be possible for agreement to be reached between the British and American Delegations forthwith on the urgent question of 1. Zones of Occupation in Germany.Mr. STETTINIUS thought that, though there had been agreement betweenthe Americans and British on the zones of occupation in Germany, there were still relatively minor points outstanding, notably in connexion with the ports ofBremen and Bremerhaven. He thought it important to get agreement on these,particularly in view of the fact that the Russians might soon be in Berlin andhave views of their own as regards the zones if our two Governments do not approve the carefully negotiated protocol.Mr. EDEN said.that he understood that there were only certain small pointsunsettled; he agreed that it was desirable to get these tied up, and thought thatthese points could be cleared up by agreement with the military authoritiesforthwith. *It was agreed that it would be most important for us to get the Russians to approve the protocols on control machinery and zones of occupation.Mr. STETTINIUS next raised the question of zones for the French. ThePresident was disposed to give the French a zone. This might include thesouthern part of the British zone and the northern part of the American, saidMr. Stettinius.SIR A. CADOGAN asked whether the Americans had had any indicationfrom the French what zone they desired; he thought we should consult them before taking our decision. Neither the British nor the Americans had as yet had any such indication.It was agreed that the approval of the Russians should be sought to theproposal that the Americans and British should agree on a zone with the French;it was also agreed that the French should be integrated into the control machinery.2. Zones of Occupation in Austria.Mr. EDEN raised the question of zones of occupation in Austria.Mr. MATTHEWS said that there had been general agreement as&apos;to theareas except as to exact extent of the Viennese zone.Mr. EDEN said that Sir William Strang had told the European AdvisoryCouncil that we favoured the American view on Vienna rather than the Russian.He was not sure, however, that apart from this issue there was in fact agreement as to zones.It was recalled that the French had also asked for a zone in Austria,* The outstanding points were cleared up at lunch with General of the Army Marshall and field Marshal Brooke, and telegrairis were despatched to the Foreign Office and the UnitedStates Embassy in London with a view to the European Advisory Council being informed ofthe approval of their Governments of the proposed zones of occupation in Germany.Present:Mr. Eden.Sir A. Cadogan.Mr. Butler.Mr. Dixon.Mr. Stettinius.Mr. Matthews.Mr. Hiss.
3. Poland,Mr. STETTINIUS said that from the point of view of American publicopinion it was extremely important that some equitable solution should be reached.It was impossible for the United States Government simply to recognise theLublin Provisional Government. What seemed to be required was some kind of council including all the relevant sections including M. Mikolajczyk. Failure toreach a satisfactory solution of this question at the forthcoming meeting would greatly disturb public opinion in America especially among the Catholics, andmight prejudice the whole question of American participation in the post-war world organisation.   He asked whether the British had any formula.Mr. EDEN agreed that the British too could not recognise the LublinProvisional Government. M. Mikolajczyk had put forward a suggestion for apresidential council which would be chosen partly from London elements, partly from the Lublin Provisional Government and partly from elements in Poland.Of the latter he instanced the Archbishop of Cracow, M. Witos andM. Zulawski, a leader of the Socialist party. He thought that M. Bierut wouldbe a member of the presidential council from the Lublin Provisional Government.SIR, A. CADOGAN thought the Russians might be suspicious of aproposal which might seem to them rather complicated. He suggested thatwe should ask them to agree to a new interim Government, and that we might suggest a presidential council as one method of securing this. We should avoidsuggesting a fusion between the Lublin Provisional Government and the LondonGovernment.It was agreed, upon the proposal of Mr. Stettinius, that the two Delegationsshould put up notes to the President and the Prime Minister in the above sense,bringing out in particular the point of the prejudicial effect on American opinionof failure to reach ^a satisfactory solution, and also that this would put in an impossible position all those in Great Britain most anxious to work in withRussia,The possibility was discussed of the Russians refusing to play.It was agreed that a deadlock would be bad, but that a simple recognition ofthe Lublin Provisional Government would be even worse.4. Persia.Mr. EDEN raised the subject of Persia. He said that the essential point was to maintain the independence of Persia, which was still threatened by the pressure which the Russian Government had been maintaining for some time onthe Persian Government, mainly in connexion with the oil concession which thePersian Government had declined to give them. He suggested that an offer mightbe made to the Russians for the withdrawal of troops gradually and part passu-,after the Governments had agreed that the supply route through Persia was nolonger required, which might be about June. He was obliged, however, to makea reservation that our military might feel it necessary to retain certain troops forthe protection of the vital oilfields in southern Peria,Mr, MATTHEWS pointed out that in this case the Russians would insist on maintaining troops in the north.It was recalled that both the Americans and British had a grievance againstthe Russians in that British and American companies had proceeded &quot;quite far intheir applications for oil concessions in South Persia, and that their negotiations had been arrested by the ham-handed procedure of the Russians in demanding a concession in the north which raised political issues.It was agreed that for the three Powers to appear to default on the specificundertakings in the Tehran Declaration would have repercussions elsewhere, forinstance in connexion with Dumbarton Oaks, and that it was important to try toget the Russians to agree (a) to the principle of gradual pari passu withdrawal and (b) that the Persian Government - were entitled to decline to negotiate oilconcessions as long as foreign troops were in occupation of their territory.5. Warm Water Port for Russia (Straits and the Far East).Mr. STETTINIUS said that the President had in mind the question ofRussian interests in a warm water port. He enquired whether the British had any indication as to what the Russians wanted.
Mr. EDEN said that the Russians certainly wished to revise the MontreuxConvention. We had told them that thev should put their ideas on paper. Wehad no clear indication of what they had in mind but it might be that they would wish for a regime for the Straits similar to that of the Suez Canal which wouldenable their warships to pass from the Black Sea into the Mediterranean intime of war.Mr. Eden continued that the Russians would be wanting a good many things,that we had not very much to offer them, but that we required a great dealfrom them. He felt, therefore, that we ought to arrange to put together allthe things we wanted against what we had to give. This would apply to theFar East also. In his view if the Russians decided to enter the war against japan they would take the decision because they considered it in their interests that the Japanese war should not be successfully finished by the United Statesand Great Britain alone. There was therefore no need for us to offer a high price for their participation, and if we were prepared to agree to their territorialdemands in the Ear East we should see to it that we obtained a good return in respect of the points on which we required concessions from them.In the course of discussion the views were put forward that the russians would certainly want the lower part of Sakhalin and transit rights in southernManchuria.6. China.The desirability of unity being achieved between the Kuomintang and the communists was raised, and reference was made to the President having some doubts as to whether the British- desired this unity.Mr. EDEN could not account for this idea having arisen; we were most anxious that unity should be secured.Mr. STETTINIUS said that he had not heard the report.It was agreed that the military situation had improved somewhat, partlythrough the diversion of two divisions from Burma to China, and partly throughthe reopening of the Burma Road.Mr. STETTINIUS urged that the British, Soviet and American Govern-ments make every effort to bring about agreement between Chiang Kai-Shek andthe Communists.7. Emergency High Commission for Europe.Mr. STETTINIUS referred to the two papers on this subject which mr. Bohlen had communicated in London to Sir A. Cadogan. He asked Mr. Hissto explain briefly their purpose.Mr. HISS said that the essential purpose was to secure unity of approachbetween the three Big Powers to the manifold difficulties that must arise in liberated territories in Europe. The proposed High Commission would be atemporary body functioning until the World Organisation was set up. It wouldnot include Germany, which was handled by the European Advisory Council;but in any case, the scope including the psychological approach was different!Mr. STETTINIUS stressed that the Commission would be composed of four members, i.e., by the inclusion of the French, or possibly more.Mr. EDEN made it clear that the British were much attracted by theproposal. JMr. MATTHEWS said that its presentation to the Russians would requireconsiderable care, as the question of Poland was involved.Mr. EDEN foresaw that one difficulty would be to find members of theCouncil who would be able to take responsibility for decisions of importance-the Russians would find this particularly difficult. Apart from this, there wasthe further difficulty that responsibility for such decisions vis-a-vis their own public opinion must rest with the Foreign Secretaries of each country who couldneither be permanently in session in a foreign country nor delegate their dutiesbeyond a certain measure.
Mr. STETTINIUS shared this view, but explained that the intention hadbeen that the members of the proposed Council would refer to their homeGovernments before the Council took decisions of importance.Mr. EDEN raised the further point of the relation between the Counciland quarterly meetings of the Foreign Secretaries to which he attached importance. It was felt that it should not be impossible to work out an arrange-ment combining both plans.There was some discussion as to the title of the body. It was felt that sometitle must be found which would not wound the susceptibilities of the smallerAllies and at the same time would not seem to cut across the duties of the european advisory Council and the Allied Control Commissions in certain enemy countries.It was thought that Mr. Matthews&apos; suggestion of &quot; Liberated Areas EmergencyCouncil &quot; deserved consideration.Mr. STETTINIUS stressed that the proposal must still be regarded asinformal and unofficial as the President had not yet approved it. The president had indeed some misgiving that its adoption might prejudice the prospects ofthe World Organisation which was the question of paramount importance.   .Mr. MATTHEWS pointed out that if the idea fructified some public announcement would be necessary as regards it and certain other kindred subjects.Mr. STETTINIUS said that the ideal result of &quot;Argonaut&quot; would be two declarations, one bringing to birth the World Organisation and the other in regard to the Emergency High Commission. American public opinion keenlyanticipated a satisfactory declaration as regards the World Organisation in thecourse of the next week, and if this were not forthcoming its prospects would be seriously jeopardised.It was agreed that in view of the informality of the proposal the PrimeMinister should be advised not to raise the question of the Emergency high commission with the President.8. Germany.Some discussion followed on the future of Germany. It was felt that boththe political and economic aspects needed working out by some international body.Mr. STETTINIUS enquired whether this was not in the province of theEuropean Advisory Council and there was agreement that it was.Mr. EDEN summed up that with the Russians so close to Berlin it was urgently necessary to reach tripartite agreement: (a) that a common political and economic policy in Germany was required,(b) that no individual nation should take action without the agreement ofthe others, and(c) that the European Advisory Council was the body in which detailed arrangements should be worked out.Other questions requiring study would be the transfer of population and prisoners of war.It was agreed that a note should be drafted embodying the views of the twoGovernments for the use of the President and the Prime Minister at&quot; Argonaut.&quot;9. Dumbarton Oaks.Mr. EDEN said that he liked the Presidents proposal for overcoming thedifficulty as regards voting by the Big Powers.Mr. MATTHEWS stressed that its adoption was virtually essential to thecreation of the World Organisation.SIR A. CADOGAN agreed that it would hardly be possible to secure thelatter with anything less.At Mr. Stettinius&apos;s request MR. HISS briefly described the american proposal. It distinguished between cases involving enforcement and cases dealtwith by discussion. For the former unanimity on the part of the Great powers would be necessary, whereas for the latter, parties to the dispute, whether Big
Powers or small, would not be entitled to vote. He stressed that this proposal,which had been described as a compromise, in effect was not so, but was actuallythe preferred solution of the United States Government.SIP A. CADOGAN endorsed this and agreed that this point should be made plain to the public.Mr. EDEN agreed.It was agreed (1) that two types of documents were required : first, a document setting out the American proposal, which would be the document to be presented to the Russians; and, secondly, brief and clear explanations of it forthe information of the President and the Prime Minister; and (2) that ifapproved it would be for the President to present the plan formally at&quot;Argonaut&quot; both to Marshal Stalin and to Mr. Churchill.Points arising in the event of agreement being reached on Dumbarton Oaks plan.(a) Position of France and China. It was agreed that the French and chinese Governments should be consulted as soon as agreement was reached and, ifthe Russians concurred, that the French should be invited to be the Fifth Powersponsoring the plan. The United States Government would be responsible for communicating the documents to, and obtaining the concurrence of, both theFrench and Chinese Governments.(&amp;) The invitations to other States to be present at the eventual united nations Conference should be issued jointly in the name of all five governments and by each of them individually. It was realised that the Russian government might raise some objection to this in connection with China.10. Polish-German Frontier.Mr. EDEN said that the apparent desire of the Lublin Provisional Govern-ment to secure for Poland large additional sections of Germany involving8 million persons was causing him some anxiety. He thought that Poland was entitled to East Prussia and part of Upper Silesia, and certain other territoriesup to the Oder.Mr. MATTHEWS said that that was the American view and referred alsoto the inclusion of the eastern tip of Pomerania. He stressed also the Americanview that the transfer of populations should be gradual and not precipitate.SIR A. CADOGAN thought that agreement in principle between the americans and British on this point might be registered now.  This was agreed to.11. Austro-Yugoslav Frontier.Mr. EDEN referred to the fact that British troops under the proposed zonearrangement would be responsible for the Austrian frontier with Yugoslavia,and that one could not exclude the possibility that Marshal Tito would wish to occupy part of Austrian territory which was claimed for Yugoslavia. Theposition would be safeguarded if the three Big Powers were to tell Marshal Titothat the frontiers must remain as they are until the Peace Treaty, at whichclaims of parties concerned would be settled.Mr. STETTINIUS expressed concurrence in this procedure.12. Conduct of the Russians in Eastern Europe.It was pointed out that there were two main questions on which we had reason for complaint in regard to Russian conduct (a) in connection with theControl Commissions and (b) in connection with the British and American oilinterest in Roumania.It was generally felt that, while the position on the Control Commission forRoumania was now more satisfactory, it was important to insist with the Russiansthat before the Commissions took action there must be prior consultation withthe Americans and British. Should the Russian Government feel obliged to take any unilateral action on military grounds, not covered in the Armistice, thisshould be taken on their sole responsibility and in the name of the SovietGovernment..[29177]c
It was agreed that the British Delegation should draw up a paper whichwould include Hungary specifying the points on which dissatisfaction was feltwith the Russian conduct in Eastern Europe. This paper, if the American delegation concurred in it, would serve for presentation by Mr. Eden toM. Molotov at some meeting between the three Foreign Secretaries.13. Civil Supplies.Mr. EDEN raised this question and Mr. Stettinius said that he understood      that Admiral Land had submitted a paper on the subject.   It appeared thatthe British and American civil authorities were in agreement but it remained to persuade the American military.It was understood that the next stage would be for the matter to be discussed by the Combined Chiefs of Staff, and if agreement were not reached by them,between the President and the Prime Minister.14. Prisoners of War.SIR A. CADOGAN said that he understood that the Russian delegation at &quot; Argonaut &quot; would include an official who would be prepared to discuss thissubject. There were in effect two questions :*(a) the treatment of Allied civilianand military prisoners of war who were liberated by the Russians, and (b) ourown treatment of Russian prisoners of war who came into our hands.It was agreed that the procedure for handling this with the Russian expertshould be discussed by the American and British experts who were present a &quot;Cricket.&quot;15. Anglo-American Warning to Germany about Allied Prisoners of War.Mr. MATTHEWS said that the State Department were disposed to agreewith the text proposed by the Foreign Office but that&apos; the United States war department had some views on the subject.It was agreed that the timing of any statement would be important and thatthe proper time would be when the German collapse seemed imminent or whensome German outrage was threatened.16. Treatment of Major War Criminals.Mr. EDEN said that when this was discussed at Moscow in October marshal stalin had disagreed with our view for favouring some summary executions andhad said that some form of judicial procedure was necessary. The Prime minister was still considering what the British attitude on this subject would be.j

Pavlov (interpreter).AFTER the opening compliments, the arrangements for the - day were discussed, namely: 3 p.m.   Marshal Stalin to visit the Prime Minister.4 p.m.   Marshal Stalin to visit the President. &apos;5 p.m.   Plenary Session of the three Heads of Government.;: With regard to attendance at the Plenary Session, M. MOLOTOV left it tothe discretion of the Prime Minister and the President to invite anyone they liked.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that the Prime Minister wished to keep theMeeting as small as possible, and proposed that the Prime Minister, the Secretaryof State, the three Chiefs of&quot; Staff and Sir A. Cadogan should attend.M. MOLOTOV said that the Soviet. Delegation would be as follows : marshal stalin, M. Molotov, Army General Antonov (Deputy Chief of Staff), AdmiralKuznetsov, Air Marshal Khudyakov, M. Gousev, M. Gromyko. (The Secretaryof State thereupon added the name of Sir A. Clark Kerr.) As regards the agenda for this evening&apos;s Plenary Session, the Soviet Government wished to discussGermany, principally as regards the military situation. The representative ofthe Red Army staff would make a report on the situation at the front.Marshal Stalin had suggested that meetings of the three Heads of Govern-ment should take place at the Presidents Villa (Livadia). With regard to the duration of the Conference, M. MOLOTOV suggested five to six days.THE SECRETARY OF STATE agreed to the above. He asked whether, inaddition to the military situation in Germany, the political situation would alsobe discussed.  M. MOLOTOV said it would.The Secretary of State said that apart from Germany there were other important questions which would have to be discussed during the Conference,such as Dumbarton Oaks and Poland. M. MOLOTOV said that on certain aspects of the Polish question, the British and Russians agreed quickly, on othersthere was difficulty. He thought it was best not to interfere with the Poles as theyhad now been liberated.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that Poland would certainly have tobe discussed, and asked whether, in addition to the European Advisory Commis-sion, M. Molotov had other suggestions to make about further collaboration between us.M. MOLOTOV said that the possibility of collaboration was unlimited. THESECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that, as the end of the war was approach-ing, he thought they should consider in what way they could still further improve relations.  M. MOLOTOV said that this was a question which could be discussed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE asked whether there were any other points for the Agenda. M. MOLOTOV replied that the Soviet Delegation had noproposals except the above-mentioned question of Germany, but they were willingto listen to any suggestions. He would prefer that there should be no fixed^agenda for the discussions, which could deal with questions as they arose. Though an agenda might have been desirable the Soviet Government had not discussed anyparticular programme, especially as the whole Conference had been treated withsuch secrecy. THE SECRETARY OF STATE suggested that the question ofthe agenda might be settled that afternoon.  M. MOLOTOV agreed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that Mr. Stettinius and he had hadtalks on the way out in a general way. M. MOLOTOV said jocularly that itwould certainly make the work of the Conference easier if the Americans andBritish had. already agreed. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said thediscussions with the Americans had been general.[29177]F.S.M.

Name of Conference.During the course of the lunch M. Molotov proposed a toast to the &quot; Crimea conference.&quot; After a brief discussion it was suggested that the conference should be so called.2. Dismemberment of Germany.THE SECRETARY OF STATE asked M. Molotov what the Russianssuggested for discussion at the plenary meeting in the afternoon.M. MOLOTOV replied that the Soviet Delegation was prepared to discussany questions the United States or the United Kingdom Delegations desired.This included those relating to the dismemberment of Germany as well as politicaland economic matters relating to that country.THE SECRETARY OF STATE aaid that the general subject needed further study before any final decision could be made.M. MOLOTOV said that he believed that the British and Americans were considerably ahead of the Russians in their studies on this question.THE SECRETARY OF STATE replied that, although the British hadstudied the matter on a technical level, there had as yet been no cabinet discussion on the question. He said that the President, the Prime Ministerand Marshal Stalin would probably be unable to come to any final decision that day on the subject of the treatment of Germany and suggested that the matter bethe subject of a j.oint study by the three countries.M. MOLOTOV seemed to favour this idea.THE SECRETARY OF STATE suggested that the Prime Minister, thePresident and Marshal Stalin should discuss the treatment of Germany ingeneral terms at their meeting and that they should refer the question to thethree Foreign Ministers for further study and instruct them to report back withdefinite proposals. 1M. MOLOTOV agreed to this also.3. Economic Matters.M. MOLOTOV informed Mr. Stettinius that the Soviet Government expectedto receive reparations in kind from Germany and hoped that the United states would furnish the Soviet Union with long-term credits.Mr. STETTINIUS replied that his Government had studied this question and that they were ready to discuss it with M. Molotov at any time. This couldeither be done here or later in Moscow or Washington.4. Roumanian Oil Equipment.SIR A. CLARK KERR asked M. Vyshinski what had become of the oilequipment which the Russians had removed from the Roumanian oil fields.M. VYSHINSKI assured Sir A. Clark Kerr that only surplus equipmenthad been removed, that the industry was being reconstructed and that some ofthe works were already functioning.

Dismemberment of Germany.THE PRESIDENT suggested that political questions about germany should be discussed. There were many things to discuss. One of the first wasthe question of the zones of occupation. He understood that the French wanted a zone of occupation. It was essential to know what they were going to do withGermany in the next few weeks or months. He produced a map showing what heand the Prime Minister had talked about in Quebec and tentatively agreed on.MARSHAL STALIN said that he would also like the following questions to be discussed : ^(1) Dismemberment of Germany. There had been an exchange of viewsbetween the three heads of Government in Tehran and between himself and the Prime Minister at Moscow, but no definite decisionhad been reached. He understood that all of them favoureddismemberment, but the exact form of dismemberment had still to bedecided.(2) Did they propose to set up a Government or Governments in Germany,or, alternatively, should they only set up some form of administration,either for the whole of Germany, or for the parts into which it was tobe divided&apos;?(3) As regards unconditional surrender, on which they were all agreed, ifHitler were to surrender unconditionally, would they preserve hisGovernment or not? They had already had experience of theJ enf or.ce-ment of unconditional surrender in the case of Italy, but definitedemands were put forward. Did we propose to work out at this conference definite terms for the unconditional surrender ofGermany ?As regards dismemberment, the President at Tehran had suggested thatGermany should be divided into five parts. The Prime Minister had hesitatedbut was also in favour of dismemberment in some form. He had associated himself with the Presidents view. The Prime Minister had suggested dividing Germanyinto two parts, namely, Prussia and Austria-Bavaria. This had been on theassumption that the Ruhr and Westphalia area was under some form of inter-national control.  He had replied that this might prove more appropriate, but no
decision had been reached at Moscow in the absence of the President. Hesuggested that the time had now come to take a definite decision.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in principle all were agreed on thedismemberment of Germany, but the actual method was much too complicated tosettle here in five or six days. It would require a very searching examination ofthe historical, ethnographical and economic facts and would need prolongedconsideration by a special committee, which would have to go into the differentproposals put forward and advise on them.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he could not give any immediateanswer as to how Germany should best be divided in order to secure futurepeace and he would feel free, after detailed examination, to; change any tentative-view he might express. He had in mind in the first place the case of Prussia,the arch-evil doer. If she were separated from the rest of Germany, her powerto begin another war would be greatly limited. He thought personally thatthe establishment of another considerable German State to the south, whichmight find its capital in Vienna, would be the main line of division betweenPrussia and the rest of Germany, and would be an approximately fifty/fiftydivision in terms of population. There were also other questions which had still to be decided in principle or which it was necessary to consider. In the firstplace they were agreed that Germany should4 lose certain territories which hadbeen largely conquered by the Soviet Armies and which were needed in connectionwith the Polish settlement. There were also the questions of the Rhine Valleyand of the German-French frontier and the future of the great industrial zones of the Ruhr and the Saar. Should these zones be handed over to France, orremain under German administration or under the supervision of the world organisation, or should there be a condominium of the Great Powers for thispurpose and for a limited period, with the duty of preserving the peaceful andinnocuous life of these important regions. These were matters which neededvery searching study and His Majesty&apos;s Government would want to consider carefully the attitude of their two great Allies. Finally, there was the questionwhether Prussia. herself, after having been isolated, should be subjected to internal division. On this question he had no fixed opinion, and would like thematter to be explored in detail with the Americans and the Russians, and theFrench would also have to be consulted as regards Western Germany.&apos; One point which could be settled at once was the setting up of some body for examinationof these matters, and we should have the report of such a body before reaching any final decision. All the detailed arrangements for immediate German surrenderhad been worked out and were well-known to the three Governments. All thatremained was formal agreement on the zones and on the machinery of control inGermany.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether, if some group in Germany declaredthat they had overthrown Hitler, we should be prepared to negotiate with such aGovernment.THE PRIME MINISTER sketched out a probable course of events. IfHitler or Himmler were to come forward and offer unconditional surrender, itwas clear that our answer should be that we would not negotiate with any of thewar criminals. If those were the only people the Germans could produce, weshould have to go on with the war. It was more probable that Hitler and his associates would have been killed or would have disappeared, and that anotherset of people would offer unconditional surrender. In that case the three great powers must immediately consult and decide whether such people were worthdealing with or not. If it was decided that they were, the terms of surrenderwhich had been worked out would be laid before them; if not, the war would becontinued and the whole country occupied by strict military government.MARSHAL STALIN asked when the question of dismemberment wouldbe mentioned to any new group that might emerge in Germany if no provisionfor it had been made in the terms of surrender; and he suggested that a provision should be inserted accordingly.THE PRIME MINISTER said that such a group of Germans wouldsurrender unconditionally and there was&apos;no need to discuss the future of germany with them since unconditional surrender would give the Allies the opportunityto discuss such matters at their leisure. By the terms of the surrender theywould reserve all their rights over German land, liberties and even lives
MARSHAL STALIN said that it was not a question of discussing it withthem, but of simply putting forward the demands.THE PRIME MINISTER said there was no need to do that at the outset.Before they did it, they must all be agreed on what exactly it was they wanted.He suggested that the study of this question should begin immediately.THE PRESIDENT said that the question of whether Germany should bedismembered or not was something which should be settled in principle here,but not in detail. The only difference between Marshal Stalin&apos; and the PrimeMinister was that Marshal Stalin wanted to add to the surrender terms a state-ment to the effect that Germany would be dismembered. From his experience ofGermany forty years ago, before the Reich had come into existence, he himself was decidedly in favour of decentralisation and therefore of dismemberment.He did not know whether the best division was into five states or seven, or moreor less.THE PRIME MINISTER repeated that there was no need to inform theGermans at the moment of surrender of the future policy to be pursued. decisions about their future must be taken in close accord. While the troops were movingin there would be time for a body, specially set up for the purpose, to give advice which would enable us to take wise decisions.THE PRESIDENT pointed out that if the question of dismembermentbecame a matter of public discussion there would be a hundred different plans and he suggested that the three Foreign Secretaries should be asked to producewithin twenty-four hours a plan for the study of dismemberment and that adefinite plan for dismemberment be produced within thirty days.THE PRIME MINISTER said that His Majesty&apos;s Government wereprepared now to assent to the principle of dismemberment and the setting up of whatever was thought to be the best body for the study of how it should be putinto effect.MARSHAL STALIN approved. He said that he had put this question sothat it would be quite clear what we wanted. Events in Germany were developingtowards catastrophe. In addition&apos;to the defeats she was suffering on the eastern front,.she would shortly be faced with an offensive on the Western Front as well;and it was a question not only of military but also of internal politicalcatastrophe. Food was becoming scarcer and coal resources were disappearing.The Ruhr would soon be under Allied guns. In view of this rapid developmentof events, they could not delay their own preparations and should know whatto do when the moment came. He therefore thought that this question shouldbe settled at this Conference. He did not ask that a detailed plan should bedrawn up at once and was prepared to accept the Presidents compromise, namely that they should agree in principle to dismemberment, that they should empower the Foreign Secretaries to elaborate a detailed plan and should add to theirsurrender terms a general statement to the effect that Germany would bedismembered. It was very important that it should be stated in the surrenderterms that Germany would be dismembered, and it would be an advantage to theAllies to have such a provision in order that any group coming to power should sign it and thus make it easier eventually to get Germany to accept the terms.THE PRIME MINISTER then read out the whole of Article 12 of the instrument of Surrender and said it gave the Allies all the powers that theyneededTHE PRESIDENT pointed out that it said nothing about decentralisationand did not make it clear enough that.dismemberment might be involved. It was his belief and also Marshal Stalin&apos;s that some reference to dismemberment would save a great deal of time.MARSHAL STALIN said that this provision should remain secret for thetime being and should only be put forward to the Germans when they offered to surrender.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would find it very difficult to-day togo beyond saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed in principle to dis-memberment and was prepared to establish a body to discuss the best methodof effecting it. He agreed to the most rapid examination possible of the best method of studying the question, but he did not believe it was possible at this conference to discuss the actual method of putting dismemberment into practice.
He would agree to the three Foreign Secretaries considering Article 12 andseeing whether a reference to dismemberment could not be added, or some words which would cover dismemberment.MARSHAL STALIN and THE PRESIDENT concurred in this proposal,and it was agreed that the three Foreign Secretaries should consider the matteraccordingly.2. French Zone of Occupation.THE PRESIDENT raised the question whether a zone of occupation inGermany should be allocated to the French. He understood that they did notclaim to extend their sovereignty up to the Rhine.MARSHAL STALIN said that, when the French were in Moscow, general de Gaulle had told him that they wanted to annex German territory up to the rhine.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was impossible to settle that question to-day. The President^ question related only to a zone of occupation. All three great Powers had agreed to certain zones and now the French wanted a zone for themselves. He personally was in favour of it, and he would gladly give them partof the British zone. All he wanted was that the Soviet Government should agreethat the British and Americans should arrange with the French what part theFrench should take of the British and American zones of occupation.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether this would be a precedent for other states also.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that the British Government would find it a great burden to occupy a large area for a long time and would be very glad ifthe French would take part of the burden. No other Power would have a zone to itself, but it might be convenient if the Dutch and the Belgians were to relieve us of part of our burden in our own zone.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether, if the French had a zone to themselves,that would mean that the French would be admitted as a fourth Power in theControl Commission for Germany, which had hitherto been considered a three-Power body.THE PRIME MINISTER said that His Majesty&apos;s Government thoughtthat France should become members of the Control Commission for Germany, andas the French army grew, France would be able to take more responsibility.MARSHAL STALIN said that the addition of a fourth member might raisecomplications and that it might be better for the British to get the help of France,Holland and Belgium in occupying Germany, but not to give them the right to sit on the Control Commission. If this was acceptable, the Russians might also ask the right to invite help from other States, but not to include them in the central administration.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the French clemand was for azone of their own. When Marshal Stalin suggested that the British shouldallocate part of the British zone to them, he would observe that that depended onthe status to be granted to France. He was in favour of the French occupyingpart of Germany as they knew a lot about them and would do it quite well. Norwere they likely to be lenient. His Majesty&apos;s Government wished to see theFrench army grow so that Great Britain would not have to bear the full weightof a fresh German attack in the west. It was very uncertain whether the UnitedStates would take part in the occupation of Germany for more than a few years,and therefore the French army must be developed. Otherwise there would be an intolerable burden on the United Kingdom. If the Russians wished to make useof another Power in their zone, he would have no objection and perhaps Polandcould play a part.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether this meant that the Poles should share in the control, and the PRIME MINISTER said no.THE PRESIDENT said that the United States would take all reasonablesteps to preserve peace, but not at the expense of keeping a large armyindefinitely in Europe, 3,000 miles away from home. That was why the Americanoccupation was limited to two years.
THE PRIME MINISTER said he hoped that the matter would be recon-sidered in the light of circumstances. The British certainly needed French helpagainst Germany in the West as they might be in difficulties if the Germans wereto rise again.MARSHAL STALIN said that he quite understood. The French weretheir Allies also, and they too were interested that France should have a large army. He had talked to General de Gaulle about that recently, as well as toM. Daladier before the war.THE PRESIDENT said that he wanted to keep the numbers on the control commission small, and though he was in favour of the French having a zone oftheir own, he was not in favour of their being members of the Control Commission.MARSHAL STALIN said that the presence of the French on the control commission might make it difficult to refuse the same thing to others. He was infavour of France resuming her position as a Great Power, but it was impossible toforget that in this war the French had opened the gates to the enemy, but forwhich the Great Powers would not have suffered so many losses. The control commission for Germany must consist only of those Powers who had stood firmlyagainst Germany from the beginning, and in any case the French had not so far been admitted to meetings of the Great Powers.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that we had all got into difficulties atthe beginning of the war, and that the French had gone under and not been ableto do much to help subsequently. The fact remained that they were the largestof Germany&apos;s immediate neighbours and that Great Britain would need a strongFrench army to contain Germany in the West. It would be very inconvenientif the Great Powers had to add to their number on all matters, but British publicopinion would not understand it if questions such as these relating to germany were settled without French participation. It was not possible to deal with theFrench frontiers and such matters concerning JN orth-Western Germany withoutthe French participating in such discussions. He himself had been opposed toGeneral de Gaulle coming to this meeting and so also had been the President and marshal Stalin. The prolonged control of Germany without French participationwould be very difficult. The Americans were free to go away from Europe butthe French would always remain next door to Germany; and the security ofGreat Britain demanded that France should have a strong army and should bein a position to prevent rocket sites, &amp;c, being built on the French coast. ThePrime Minister therefore proposed that a zone should be offered to the&apos; Frenchout of the British and American zones, and that the question of the status ofFrance and her relations with the major Allies should be the subject of separatediscussions. France would not take a zone if she were not allowed to take herplace on the central authority for Germany. Such participation by France wouldnot give her access -to meetings of the Great Powers.THE PRESIDENT pointed out that France was a member of the E.A.C.which was considering German affairs. He therefore agreed that she should bepromised a zone but that anything further should be postponed for the time being.MARSHAL STALIN agreed.THE PRESIDENT continued that in Holland several million people hadbeen displaced by the flooding of the land with salt water. It would be necessaryfor the Allies to take care of them, and an area of farm land in Germany mighthave to be set aside for them for 5 or 6 years. If the Dutch took such landthey might also press for a place on the Control Commission and it was thereforebetter to confine membership to three. 4Mr. EDEN said that, if the French had a zone but no place on the control commission, he did not see how as a matter of practical administration the french zone was to be controlled.MARSHAL STALIN suggested that this should be done by instructions from the British.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the French would not accept any zoneon such terms. In any case, if the French had a zone, control over it would haveto be exercised from the centre and therefore a French representative would haveto be there. &quot;Otherwise, if ohey pursued a unilateral policy, how could the british control them ? Whatever was decided as regards the membership of the Control[29177]
Commission would not affect the meetings of the three Great Powers, It wouldbe a commission of officials under the Great Powers on the analogy of the E.A.C.,which was also a subordinate body for a specific purpose.Mr. EDEN said that the French had pressed this request very strongly inParis and asked whether they had done the same in Moscow.MARSHAL STALIN said they had spoken of it but had been told that thequestion could only be settled by the three Powers together.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we had also told them that.Mr. EDEN said that, if it was agreed that the French were to have a zone,the general consequences of this would have to be worked out in detail.THE PRESIDENT agreed.After some further discussion it was agreed that a zone should be allocated to the French out of the British and American zones; and that the three foreign secretaries should consider how control should be exercised over that zone.3. Reparation.PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT said that the question of reparations fellunder several heads. The first was man-power. How much use did the Russianswish to make of German man-power? The United States did not want to makeany use of German man-power, and he gathered that the British did not either.MARSHAL STALIN said that they were not yet ready to deal with thequestion of man-power, but that they had prepared a plan dealing withreparations in kind.THE PRESIDENT suggested that the Conference should hear an accountof the Russian scheme for dealing with reparations in kind.MARSHAL STALIN said that M. Maisky would give an account of thismatter.M. MAISKY said that the Russian plan foresaw that reparations in kind would be demanded from Germany in two forms : The first would be the with-drawal from Germany of national wealth at the end of the war. By national wealth he meant factories, plant, machine tools, rolling-stock, and so forth. Thesecond form reparations would take would be yearly payments in kind for a periodof ten years after the end of the war.Furthermore, in order to restore the Russian economy, which had suffered from German aggression, and in order to enable security in Europe to bere-established, it would be necessary that, at the end of the war, German heavy industries should be reduced to about 20 per cent, of the present figure. In&quot;heavy industry&quot; he included iron, steel, heavy engineering, chemicals and electrical industry. These industries could be used for making reparation payments.It was also contemplated that 100 per cent, of the factories specialising inthe manufacture of purely military products should be removed from Germany.The same would apply to aircraft factories and plants for producing synthetic oil.They believed that 20 per cent, of the German heavy industries would suffice to deal with Germany&apos;s real economic needs. A sketch list had been prepared ofthe goods which would be supplied by way of reparations in kind. This list could,if need be, be elaborated.The Russians thought that removal of factories should be completed within two years, and that reparations in kind should be terminated within ten years.In order, however, that when Germany had completed the payment of reparationssecurity should be maintained, it was suggested that an American-Russian-BritishInternational Control Organisation should be established to exercise strict controlover the German economy. The Peace settlement should contain provisions dealing with those industries which were most important for war purposes, andwhich would have to be put under international control with representatives ofthe three Great Powers on the boards of the companies. This international control would not terminate when reparations in kind came to an end. It wouldbe for consideration how long this international control would have to becontinued.What type of losses should be covered by reparation payment? The extentof the damage done by Germany would amount to so astronomical a figure that
the Russians thought that it would be necessary to limit very strictly the losses to be paid for by reparation. In their view, reparation payments should coveronly direct material losses, such as destruction of private and public property,factories, cattle, corn, and so forth. Even this, however, would amount to so large a total that reparation payments would not cover it. It would therefore benecessary to set up priorities among the countries who would obtain reparations.They suggested that two criteria should be laid down : The first would be the proportionate contribution to the winning of the war; the second, the propor-tionate value of the direct material losses sustained by each country. they proposed that a Reparation Commission should be set up in Moscow, composedof representatives of the three Great Powers, to work out details of the reparationproblem on the basis of principles to be agreed.The Russians had also calculated the total sum which they would like toobtain as their share of the reparation fund. They suggested a total of 10 billion(ten thousand million) dollars over a period of ten years.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled what had happened at the end of thelast war, the experience of which had been very disappointing. He thought thatthe total sum which had been extracted from Germany by way of reparations, hadbeen about  1,000 millions, and that even this sum would not have been extractedhad not America, and to a lesser extent Great Britain, lent much larger sums toGermany on which she had defaulted. He hoped that we should avoid gettinginvolved in the same difficulties on this occasion. He admitted at once that the sufferings of Russia had been greater than those of any other country, and he had always felt that the removal of plant and factories from Germany, to a certain extent, in order to repair the damage done, was a reasonable course to take.But he did not believe that it would be possible to extract from Germanyanything like the total of reparations which M. Maisky had suggested should bepaid to Russia alone., Britain too, had suffered greatly in the war. Large numbers of our houseshad been destroyed. We had parted with a very considerable proportion of our foreign investments, and we were faced with the problem of how to r aise our exports sufficiently to pay for the imports of food on which we depended. Thatalone was an important problem.Over and above the help which we had received by the generous schemeof lend-lease, we had also incurred a very heavy debt in the common cause,largely in maintaining armies in the Middle East. The total of these debtswas not far short of  3,000 millions. No victorious country would come out ofthe war with such heavy financial burdens, or with so stricken an economy as great Britain.If he could see any way in which our economy could be substantially benefitedby reparations from Germany, he would be very glad to follow it. But oncebit twice shy; and he felt grave doubts on the matter.The Prime Minister also observed that other countries had suffered greatdamage; he instanced France, Belgium, Holland and Norway. No doubt the damage was comparatively small, but the position of these countries would haveto be considered. There was also a further consideration. What would happen if Germany was reduced to a position of starvation ? Did we intend to stand byand do nothing, and say it served her right ? Or did we intend to provide enoughfood to keep the Germans alive, and if so who would pay for it ?MARSHAL STALIN said that these questions would arise in any event.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if you Wanted a horse to pull yourwagon, you had to give him&apos; some hay.THE PRIME MINISTER added that he was in favour of a ReparationCommission being set up to explore the subject with the object of ensuring thatwe got what we could by way of reparations from Germany in a sensible way.THE PRESIDENT said that he also was mindful of the events of the endof the last war, and we could not afford a repetition of them. So far as theUnited States was concerned, they did not want from Germany any man-power,any machine tools or any factories. What then could the United States look toget from Germany ? One respect in which they could hope to obtain something,although not on a very large scale, was the German property now in the hands ofthe Enemy Custodian. At the end of the last war, German properties in theUnited States had been treated as an offset to what Germany owed in other ways.He (the President) hoped that the legislation would soon be passed to take thisproperty out of the hands of Germans, and to invest it in Special Trustees.[29177] d 2
As regards Red Cross Aid to Germany, the United States had always beengenerous, and as long as Germany had a chance to live it was impossible to killpeople. At the same time they did not want to see any higher standard of living in Germany than in Russia. They wanted to see a Germany which could sustainitself, but was not strong. The United States had no money to send food toGermany or to provide her with houses.The United States would come out of the war badly. They would be preparedto help the Soviet Government to get what they could out of Germany by thetransfer of plant, &amp;c. They would also help the British to increase their exports and would be glad to see their exports replacing German exports. In this wayBritain would be helped to pay her debts.To sum up, all that he could say was that the United States would do the bestthey could, and that the time had come to set up some form of ReparationCommission to &quot;do the best it could for all concerned.THE PRESIDENT added one word of warning. He thought it was quite impracticable to get enough out of Germany by way of reparations to repair the damage done by the Germans to houses and industry in Russia, Britain andFrance. But that did not mean that we should not get what we could out ofGermany.  (The PRIME MINISTER indicated his assent.)THE PRESIDENT said that Germany-must be left enough industry to keepher people from starving.M. MAISKY, replying to what had been said, said that the experience ofGreat Britain and the United States after the last war had, no doubt, been very bad. But the reason had not been that the reparation payments demanded hadbeen too heavy for Germany. The total had been 38 billion dollars, spread over58 years. The real trouble had arisen from the fact that reparations had beendemanded in money. This had given rise to a problem of transfer of exchangeof German marks into other currencies; and it had been on this rock that thereparation scheme had broken down. The financial policy of the United Statesand United Kingdom had also contributed a great deal to Germany&apos;s refusal to pay reparations. The present scheme, however, contemplated that allreparation payments would be in kind, and these difficulties would then be avoided.Furthermore, the amount now asked for by Russia, namely, 10 billion dollars,was equivalent to 10 per cent, of the United States budget for the present year,or six months&apos; war expenditure of Great Britain.On a comparison with peace-time expenditure, it was equivalent to about1^ of the normal United States peace-time budget, and 1\ times the normal peace-time budget of Great Britain. This showed that the amount asked wasnot very large.The Prime Minister had said that Germany must not be left to starve.But after the war Germany was not entitled to live on a higher standard ofliving than the Middle European standard. The Russians calculated thatGermany would be able to live on the Middle European standard after makingthe reparation payments now claimed. Germany would lose her heavy industries,but could develop her light industries and her agriculture. Germany economy,he contemplated, would secure a modest but a decent standard of living. It must also be remembered that Germany and Austria after the war would not be allowedto maintain military forces, and this saving on military expenditure was animportant factor. In a word, the Russians believed that their claim was wellbalanced and soundly conceived.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the question at issue should be examined by a Commission, but he thought that it should sit in secret and should be attended by no publicity.MARSHAL STALIN agreed.THE PRIME MINISTER added that while he favoured an examinationof this matter and a study of the probable claims and assets, it must not be taken that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to accept the reparation plan which had been so ably expounded, but which had not previously been broughtto their notice.PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT said that he thought that the commission should be confined to representatives of the three Great Powers.
THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the Commission should begin by being so limited, but thought that the Commission&apos;s duty should not be limitedto reparation for our own sufferings, but should also take into account those ofother countries.MARSHAL STALIN said that no Commission would be effective unless it was given certain definite lines on which to work, and certain decisions should,therefore, be reached as a basis for the Commission^ work. He thought thatin the sphere of reparation payments Great Britain, the United States and russia, who had shared the burden of the war, should all be entitled to receivethe maximum sum which any country was entitled to receive by way of reparations. All three countries had shared the main burden of the war and had been responsible for organising victory. The United States did not require machine tools or plant from Germany, but they might need something else.In calculating Germany&apos;s capacity to pay reparations in kind, it should belaid down that account should be taken of Germany&apos;s resources after the war,when man-power and factories had been turned over to civil work.MARSHAL STALIN said that he did not include France with the three great Powers, because she had suffered far less damage. Indeed, she had sufferedless than Yugoslavia and Holland. Again, while he greatly respected France,the French had done nothing by way of sacrifice or action comparable to the sacrifices or achievements of the three Great Powers. At the present time france had eight divisions in the war and some naval forces. Yugoslavia had twelvedivisions in the war and the Lublin Poles had ten divisions. He thought it wouldbe very desirable if the three Foreign Ministers were to examine the matter andreport to the Conference.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it might be helpful to try andsettle the heads of a directive to the proposed Reparation Commission during thepresent conference. Thereafter, in perhaps a month&apos;s time, a full report mightbe rendered, completing the necessary particulars under these heads. Hesuggested that the three Foreign Secretaries should be asked to prepare the headsof a draft directive. He thought it was for consideration whether exertion inthe war should be the basis; or whether the sufferings endured at the hands of theenemy would not be a sufficiently all-embracing test for the allocation of all the sums which were likely to be received by way of reparation. On either basisRussia would stand well. He added that we must not allow it to be thought thatthe Great Powers were only looking after their own interests and were leavingother nations altogether in the cold. As regards the amount to be extracted from Germany, Germany should pay according to her strength.THE PRESIDENT said that he agreed that the Commission should sit in moscow.THE PRIME MINISTER also agreed to this course.The Conference invited the three Foreign Secretaries at their meeting at12 noon on the following day to draft for submission to the Conference the headsof a directive on the lines agreed in the above discussion.4. Future Procedure.It was agreed that a further meeting should be held at 4 p.m. on the6th February, when the subjects dealt with should include : 1.   A report from! the three Foreign Secretaries on the matters remitted to them.2.   A discussion on the Dumbarton Oaks scheme for World Security.3.   Polish questions. J
F.S.M. (Argonaut) 4th Meeting,6th February, 1945.RECORD OF A MEETING HELD AT LIVADIA AT 12 noon on 6th FEBRUARY, 1945.Mr. Eden.Sir A. Cadogan.Sir A. Clark Kerr.Sir E. Bridges.Mr. Jebb.Mr. Dixon.Mr. Harrison.Mr. R. Allen.Major Theakstone (interpreter).Present:Mr. Stettinius.Mr. Early (for Item 1).Mr. Harriman,Mr. Bohlen.Mr. Matthews.Mr. Wilder Foote.Mr. Page (interpreter).M. Molotov.M. Vyshinski.M. Maisky.M. Gotjsev.M. Novikov.M. Arkadiev.M. Golunski (Interpreter).1. Issue of Communique regarding Conference.Mr. STETTINIUS said Mr. Early was present with the preliminary draft of a communique announcing that a meeting of the heads of Governmentswas taking place. It was suggested that the communique should be issued onthe 7th February. He presented copies of the draft to Mr. Eden and M. Molotovfor consideration.M. MOLOTOV said he thought it was a good communique and, after minor amendments had been settled, it was agreed that the communique should be issued- as amended.2. Dismemberment of Germany.Mr. STETTINIUS said that three topics had been referred to the foreign ministers as a result of yesterday&apos;s Plenary Meeting.   These were : (1) The procedure for studying the dismemberment of Germany.(2) The integration of France in the control machinery for Germany if she were given a zone of occupation.(3) Reparation.    In particular, principles should be laid down for the guidance of the Moscow Commission on Reparation when it was set up.Starting with the first point, he thought that an immense amount of research and study would be necessary before conclusive views on the dismemberment ofGermany could be reached. He hoped, however, that we might reach agreement on general principles at this conference. He suggested that consideration shouldbe given to the desirability of adding the word &quot; dismemberment &quot; to article 12 (a) of the Terms of Surrender for Germany (see Annex). Finally hethought that consideration should be given to- whether the study of dismember -ment should be assigned to the European Advisory Commission.M. MOLOTOV said that two points arose. As regards the addition of theword &quot; dismemberment &quot; to Article 12 he would accept this.Mr. EDEN proposed another possible formula, viz., that the second sentence of Article 12 (a) should read as follows : &quot; In the exercise of such authority they will take such steps as theydeem requisite for future peace and security, including the complete disarmament and demilitarisation of Germany and measures for the dissolution of the German unitary State.&quot;Mr. STETTINIUS said that he felt it was immaterial which of the twoforms of wording was used.
M. MOLOTOV proposed a formula which involved an alteration of the first sentence of Article 12. He suggested that to the end of the first sentence shouldbe added the words &quot; and they will take measures for the dismemberment ofGermany.&quot;Mr. EDEN said that this formula would involve a commitment not to theprinciple but to the act of dismemberment.M. MOLOTOV then suggested the insertion of a new sentence into theArticle between the first and second sentences as follows :- .&quot; In order to secure peace and security they consider necessary thedismemberment of Germany.&quot;He considered the advantage of this formula was that it set forth the reasons why the Allies considered the dismemberment of Germany essential.Mr. EDEN pointed out that this would commit us to dismemberment in all circumstances before we had made our study of the problem. This was further than he could go.M. MOLOTOV pointed out that as a result of the previous day&apos;s plenary meeting we were committed to the principle of dismemberment.Mr. EDEN said that what we now had to do was tp work out the implications-tions of this principle with particular reference to its practicability.Mr. STETTINIUS suggested that perhaps what was wanted was theinclusion of the words &quot; right to dismemberment.&quot;M. MOLOTOV pointed out that unconditional surrender already includedthat. The important thing was that the Allies considered dismembermentnecessary.Mr. EDEN said that one could not say that it was necessary until itspracticability had been worked out. It was not our fault that the E.A.C. hadnot completed a study of dismemberment as had been agreed at Tehran.M. MOLOTOV then asked to see Mr. Stettinius&apos;s suggested formula again.After consideration he thought that it would be acceptable. He then suggested a further amendment, namely, the addition of the words &quot; for future peace and security,&quot; at the beginning of the second sentence. The word &quot;such&quot; shouldbe omitted before &quot; steps &quot; and the sentence would end at &quot; Germany.&quot;Mr. EDEN said that this would leave us no choice. We would be boundto take all steps to secure dismemberment.M. MOLOTOV repeated that we had already accepted dismemberment inPrinciple.  He considered the words &quot; as they deem requisite &quot; might be omitted,he point of this amendment was that it made the principle of dismembermentmore definite.Mr. EDEN said that the original text allowed us a certain latitude. If itwere amended as suggested by M. Molotov that latitude would be denied us. Hewould be prepared to accept Mr. Stettinius&apos;s original suggestion of the additionof the words &apos;&apos; and the dismemberment&apos;&apos; after &apos;&apos; demilitarisation &apos;&apos; in the second sentence.Mr. STETTINIUS then put forward a suggestion to substitute after&quot;demilitarisation&quot; the words &quot;and the dismemberment of Germany to theextent deemed necessary for future peace and security.&quot; *Mr. EDEN said that he was prepared to agree to the insertion of the word&quot;dismemberment&quot; as originally suggested by Mr. Stettinius, but he was notprepared to do any more.M. MOLOTOV argued that this formula would be susceptible of a doubleinterpretation; it might mean that we accepted the principle of dismembermentnow; or it might only amount to acceptance in the future. He added that hisformula was more definite and gave enough latitude.Mr. EDEN said he could not accept it without reference to the PrimeMinister.
M. MOLOTOV said that the discussion might be summed up as follows :All concerned thought that it was necessary to add the word &apos;&apos; dismemberment&apos;&apos;to the Article. As regards the second amendment Mr. Eden would consult thePrime Minister.Mr. EDEN said that his position was quite clear He agreed to the firstamendment, namely the insertion of the word &quot; dismemberment,&quot; but not tothe second.  He Would, however, consult the Prime Minister.Mr. STETTINIIIS finally said that his position was as originally stated at      )the opening of the meeting.  He thought that the best solution would be to insertthe words &apos;&apos; and the dismemberment&apos;&apos; after &apos;&apos; demilitarisation &apos;&apos; in the second sentence of Article 12.Mr. STETTINIUS then enquired whether it was agreed that the study ofthe details of dismemberment should be reserved for the E.A.C.M. MOLOTOV suggested that it would perhaps be better to have a special commission.It was finally decided to leave this question open until the next meeting.ANNEX.Article 12 (Original).(a) The United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics shall possess supreme authority with respect toGermany. In the exercise of such authority they will take such steps, includingthe complete disarmament and demilitarisation of Germany, as they deemrequisite for future peace and security.Article 12 (Amended).(a) The United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics shall possess supreme authority with, respect toGermany. In the exercise of such authority they will take such steps, includingthe complete disarmament, demilitarisation and the dismemberment of germany as they deem requisite for future peace and security.)
Argonaut.   2nd Plenary Meeting (Political).6th February, 1945.RECORD OF A MEETING HELD AT THE LIVADIA PALACE, YALTA,AT 4 p.m. ON 6th FEBRUARY, 1945.PresentMarshal Stalin,m. molotov.M. Vy shin ski.M.

Allen (Item 4).Mr. Wilson.Major Birse (Interpreter).I. Dismemberment of Germany.Mr. STETTINIUS reported that the Foreign Secretaries had decidedthat the words &apos;&apos; and the dismemberment&apos;&apos; should be added after the word&quot; demilitarisation &quot; in Article 12 of the Instrument of Surrender for Germany.M. Molotov had suggested a further addition to the article and he therefore asked that a final decision should be postponed until the following meeting as agreement-had not yet been reached.M. MOLOTOV then said that he withdrew his further suggestion.Mr. STETTINIUS said that the three Foreign Secretaries were thusunanimous on their recommendation about the dismemberment of Germany.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was very much obliged to M. Molotovfor withdrawing his suggestion. He had not had an opportunity to put this tothe Cabinet, but felt that they would be in agreement and he was glad that theamendment had been accepted in this form.2. French Zone of Occupation.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether anything had been settled on thequestion how to arrange for control of the French zone. *Mr. EDEN said that this question had not been settled.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the position of France became of verygreat importance in view of the Presidents statement on the previous day aboutthe withdrawal of United States forces from Europe two years after the end ofthe war. Great Britain was not strong enough to do her part in the west againstGermany unless there was a strong French army, and they must therefore keepthat in view in the light of what the President had said.THE PRESIDENT said that he wanted to make it clear that in presentconditions public opinion in the United States was decisive.   If it was possible[29177] e
to get agreement on the Dumbarton Oaks proposals or something like them, itwas more probable that the United States would be prepared to take a full partin organising peace throughout the world. There was a large measure of support in the United States for such a World Organisation. He suggested that theForeign Secretaries should report on the following day on the other matters whichhad been referred to them.3. World Organisation.THE PRESIDENT then said that he felt that public opinion wantedsome concrete proposals to prevent war for as long a period as anybody couldforesee, that was at least 50 years, and this should be looked forward to as partof the victory in the present war. He asked Mr. Stettinius to explain the purposesof the American proposals as regards voting in the Security Council of the world organisation.Mr. STETTINIUS then made the following statement :-&apos;&apos; It was agreed at Dumbarton Oaks that certain matters would remain under consideration for future settlement. Of these, the principal one wasthat of voting procedure to be followed in the Security Council.At Dumbarton Oaks, the three Delegations thoroughly explored thewhole of this question. Since that time the matter has received continuingintensive study by each of the three Governments.On the 5th December, 1944, the President sent to Marshal Stalin and to prime Minister Churchill a proposal that this matter be settled by makingSection C, Chapter VI, of the Dumbarton Oaks proposals read substantiallyas follows: C,  Voting.1. Each member of the Security Council should have one vote.2. Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shouldbe made by an affirmative vote of seven members.3. Decisions of the Security Council on all other, matters should bemade by an affirmative vote of seven members, including the concurringvotes of the permament members; provided that, in decisions affectingpeaceful settlement, a party to a dispute should abstain from voting.We believe that our proposal is entirely consistent with the special responsibilities of the Great Powers for the preservation of the peace of theworld. In this respect our proposal calls for unqualified unanimity of thepermanent members of the Council on all major decisions relating to the pre-servation of peace, including all economic and military enforcement measures.At the same time our proposal recognises the desirability of the per-manent members frankly stating that the peaceful adjustment of anycontroversy which may arise is a matter of general world interest in which any sovereign member State involved should have a right to present its case.We believe that unless this freedom of discussion in the Council is permitted, the establishment of the World Organisation which we all soearnestly desire in order to save the world from the tragedy of another war would be seriously jeopardised. Without full and free discussion in theCouncil, the Organisation, even if it could be established, would be vastlydifferent from the one we have contemplated.The paper which we have placed before the other two delegations (see annex) sets forth the text of the provisions which I have read and listsspecifically those decisions of the Council which, under our proposals, wouldrequire unqualified unanimity and, separately, those matters in the area ofdiscussion and peaceful settlement in which any party to a dispute wouldabstain from casting a vote.From the point of view of the United States Government there are two important elements in the matter of voting procedure. First, there is thenecessity for unanimity among the permanent members for the preservation of the peace of. the world. Second, it is of particular importance to thepeople of the United States that there be provision for a fair hearing for all members of the organisation.We believe that the proposals submitted by the President to marshal stalin and Prime Minister Churchill on the 5th December, 1944, provide a
reasonable and just solution and satisfactorily combine these two main considerations.It is our earnest hope that our two great Allies will hnd it possible toaccept the Presidents proposal.&quot;Mr. Stettinius continued by saying that he believed that the United states proposals were entirely consistent with the responsibilities of the Great powers in the preservation of peace. They called for unanimity on all major decisions forthe preservation of peace, including economic as well as military measures. they recognised the desirability of the permanent members of the Security Councilfrankly stating that in any conflict on world interests in which any sovereign state was involved, that State should have the opportunity of presenting its owncase. The United States believed that without this freedom of discussion theestablishment of the World Organisation which all desired would be seriouslyjeopardised. The paper which the United States Delegation had put inset out the text of the United States proposals, and listed separately those decisions of the Council which under the United States proposal wouldrequire unanimity, and also those questions on which a party to a dispute wouldrefrain from casting a vote. From the point of view of the United States Govern-ment there were two important elements in this matter affecting procedure. First,the necessity for unanimity among the permanent members of the Council forthe preservation of the peace of the world, and, secondly, the great importance for the people of the United States that provision should be made for a fairhearing for all members of the World Organisation, great and small. he believed that the United States proposals provided a reasonable and just solutionand satisfactorily combined these two considerations. It was their earnest hopethat their two great Allies would find it possible to accept the Presidentsproposal. Mr. Stettinius then read the document (see Annex) showing the detailed application of the United States proposals.THE PRESIDENT said that this was a matter which ought to be discussed and settled. All three Powers had the same objectives, which were shared byall the small nations also, and questions of procedure should not cause any real difficulty.MARSHAL STALIN asked what differences there were in the proposals now put forward as compared with those in the Presidents message of the5th December.It was explained to the Russians that the changes were only technical andwere not changes of substance.M. MOLOTOV said that the Soviet Government also attached greatimportance to this question and would like time to study closely the new proposals of the United States Government as compared with those of the5th, December. He suggested that the discussion should be postponed to thefollowing day. -THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was content with this. He agreedthat this question should be studied at leisure and adjourned until the following day or later. He thought it right to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government had hadto examine this proposal with very serious attention. He himself had not feltwholly in agreement with the original proposals put forward at Dumbarton Oaks.He had been anxious to make sure that the realities of the position of the three great Powers had been fully faced. On studying the Presidents new proposalshis anxieties had been removed so far as the British Empire was concerned. Thatwas also true of the self-governing Dominions of the British Crown. His own view was that the achievement of world peace on a lasting foundation dependedin the last resort on the friendship and collaboration of the three Great Powers.But His Majesty&apos;s Government felt that they would be putting thenlselves ina false position, and would not be doing justice to their true intentions, if no provision was made for a full statement of grievances by the many smaller nations of the world. If no such provision was made, it might look as if the three great powers were seeking to rule the world, whereas their desire was to serve the world and to preserve it from any renewal of the frightful horrors which had fallen onthe mass of its inhabitants. He therefore felt that the three Great powers should make a proud submission to the general community of the world within thelimits stated.    .He had naturally considered how this matter would affect the fortunes and interests of the British Empire ?nd Commonwealth, and he proposed to take a-.   [29177J E 2
particular instance to illustrate why he did not feel that this submission to thegeneral community of the world would be damaging to British interests. The casehe wished to take was that of Hong Kong. If His Majesty&apos;s Government agreedto the Presidents proposal, China might ask His Majesty&apos;s Government to returnHong Kong. His Majesty&apos;s Government would have the right to state their case fully against any case made by the Chinese. But they would not be allowedto vote on the five questions set out at the end of the document in the Annex. Itwould be open to China to make her full case, and it would be open to theSecurity Council to decide on any of those questions without His Majesty&apos;sGovernment being allowed to vote.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether Egypt would take part in the Assembly.THE PRIME MINISTER said &quot;Yes,&quot; but that Egypt would not be amember of the Council unless she were.elected to it.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether any member of the Assembly couldexpress an opinion.THE PRIME MINISTER said &quot; Yes,&quot; but that if any of those five points were involved His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be allowed to vote. HisMajesty&apos;s Government accepted that position.&apos; They agreed to these proceduralmatters being decided without voting themselves. But His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould not agree to the six questions set out in the second part of the Annex beingdecided without their vote. They would consider it too great an abrogation of sovereignty that they should not themselves vote on such matters. They therefore considered that they were sufficiently safeguarded because of their rights onthese six questions. They had, in fact, the right by virtue of their voting onthese matters to stop all further action against them by the Security Council.There was no question of their being compelled by the Security Council to giveHong Kong back to China if they did not think that this was the right step forthem to take. On the other hand they felt it would be wrong that China shouldnot have a chance of stating her case fully and that the Council should not havethe powers proposed in the last five items of the Annex. In the same way, ifEgypt raised questions affecting the Suez Canal, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould submit to the procedure laid down in these last five paragraphs withoutfear, because British rights were reserved under the six items of paragraph under which Great Britain could prevent any action if she chose to do so. he presumed that, if Argentina raised a complaint against the United States, theUnited States would submit to the procedure under the last five paragraphs but would be free to raise objection to any action proposed pursuant to the first sixitems of paragraph 2 if they thought that the Monroe doctrine, for instance, wasbeing infringed.THE PRESIDENT recalled that the following phrase had been includedin the Tehran declaration : &quot; We recognise fully the supreme responsibilityresting upon us and all the nations to make a peace which will command goodwillfrom the overwhelming masses of the peoples of the world.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said that for the reasons which he had tried to illustrate, His Majesty&apos;s Government saw no danger in associating themselves with the United States proposals, and that they saw great advantages in thethree Great Powers not assuming the position of rulers over the rest of the worldwithout even allowing other nations to state their case. In fact they felt it wouldnot be right, in view of the great power which they possessed, to deny to othersthe right to state their case and to use any measures to secure adjustment of disputes short of the measures provided for under the first six items of para-graph 2 of the Annex.MARSHAL STALIN asked for a copy of the document which Mr. Stettiniushad read out. He continued that the Dumbarton Oaks decisions had set them thebask not merely of securing to every nation the right to express its opinions. Thatwas a very cheap right. If any nation raised a question about some important matter, it would raise it not merely in order to express an opinion, but in orderto get a certain decision. He felt certain that nobody at this Conference woulddispute the right of members of the Assembly to express opinions. The PrimeMinister thought that China, after raising the question of Hong Kong, would be content. This might not be so. He (Marshal Stalin) thought that China, orEgypt, would not be content with expressions of opinion about Hong Kong or the
Suez Canal, but would want a decision. Therefore the question was much more serious than merely securing the right to express an opinion- It was not a matterof the three Powers being the masters of the world, and the Dumbarton Oaksproposals should be a brake on such desires by any Power or group of Powers.Surely it was not thought that any Great Power would have the intention of beingthe master of the world?THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was thinking of the three great powers together lifting themselves so high above all other States, that the otherswould think that the rule over the whole world was to be confined to those three.MARSHAL STALIN said that he would study the document and seeif hecould understand the proposal, which at present was not altogether clear. what he feared was that, though the three Great Powers were allies to-day, and wouldnone of them commit any act of aggression, in 10 years or less the three leaderswould disappear and a new generation would come into power which had notexperienced the war and would forget what they themselves had gone through.All of them wanted to secure peace for 50 years at least. The greatest danger was the possibility of conflict among themselves, because if they remained unitedthe German danger was not very important. Therefore they must now think how to secure their unity in the future; and how to create guarantees that the three great Powers and possibly China and (at the suggestion of the Prime Minister)France would maintain a united front in the future. Some system must beelaborated whereby conflict between the main Great Powers would be prevented.He apologised for having been busy with other matters which had prevented him from studying this proposal in detail. As he understood it, the American proposal was that all conflicts fell into two categories, first those which demanded sanctions,whether economic, political or military, and secondly those which could be regulated by peaceful means: He also understood that in the consideration ofboth kinds of conflict, it was contemplated that there would be free discussion ofthe question under dispute in every case. He also understood that in the con-sideration of disputes requiring sanctions, unanimity of the permanent membersof the Council was essential; and that where a permanent member was a partyto a dispute, it had the right to vote and did not have to absent itself from thediscussion. Bui in the second category of cases the parties could not vote. TheRussians were accused of talking too much about the procedure of voting. Itwas true that they attached great importance to it, but all questions were decided by votes and they were greatly interested in the decisions which were reached.Suppose, for instance, that China as a permanent member of the Security Councildemanded the return of Hong Kong, or that Egypt demanded the return of the suez Canal, he assumed that in such circumstances China or Egypt would notbe alone and that they would have friends and perhaps protectors in the Assemblyor in the Council.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the powers of the World Organisationcould not be used against Great Britain if they remained unconvinced and refusedto agree to it.MARSHAL STALIN enquired whether that was really so and THEPRIME MINISTER assured him that it was.Mr. EDEN said that China or Egypt could complain, but that no decisioninvolving the use of force could be taken without the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.Mr. STETTINIUS said that no sanction could be taken without unanimityof the permanent members of the Security Council,&apos; though steps for peaceful settlement, e.g., arbitration might be recommended. &apos; 4MARSHAL STALIN said that his fear was that disputes about Hong Kongor Suez might break the unity of the three Great Powers.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he appreciated the danger, but thatthe World Organisation in no way destroyed normal diplomatic intercoursebetween States, great or small. The World Organisation was separate and apart, and the members would continue to discuss their affairs among themselves.It would be foolish to raise subjects in the World Organisation if they mightbreak up the unity of the Great Powers.MARSHAL STALIN gave as another illustration the fact that hiscolleagues in Moscow could not forget what had occurred in December 1939,
during the Russo-Finnish war, when the British and the French had used theLeague of Nations against them and succeeded in isolating and expelling theSoviet Union from the League, and when they had later mobilised against themand were talking of a crusade against the Soviet Union. He asked whether wecould have some guarantees that this sort of thing would not happen again.Mr. EDEN pointed out that on the American proposal this would beimpossible.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether it was possible to create even moreobstacles.THE PRIME MINISTER said that special provision had been made aboutthe unanimity of the Great Powers.MARSHAL STALIN pointed out that they had heard of these provisions to-day for the first time.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he saw cases which might cause some anxiety lest an agitation might work up against one of the Great Powers---say the British-and he could only say that normal diplomacy would be playing its part at the same time. He would not expect the President to start or to backan attack on Great Britain and he felt certain that everything would be done to stop it. He felt equally certain that Marshal Stalin would not make anattack verbally of course on the British Empire without talking to us first andtrying to find some way of coming to a friendly arrangement.MARSHAL STALIN agreed.THE PRESIDENT said that of course there would be differences betweenthe Great Powers in future. Everybody would know when this was happeningand such differences would be the subject of discussion in the Assembly. But topermit. discussion of these differences in the Council also would not promotedisunity, but, on the contrary, would show the confidence which they all hadin each other and in their ability to solve such problems. In this way discussionof these questions in the Council would strengthen their unity rather thanotherwise.MARSHAL STALIN said that this was true, and that they would study the document and continue the discussion on the following day.4. Poland.THE PRESIDENT said that, coming from America, he took a distantpoint of view of the Polish question. There were in the United States 5 or6 million Poles, mostly of the second generation. His position -and that of mostof the Poles in the United States was (as he had said at Teheran) that he was,in general, in favour of the Curzon Line. The Poles knew that they would haveto give up East Poland. As compensation, they would like East Prussia and part of Germany, but they would like something with which to save face. Ashe had said at Teheran, it would make it easier for him if the Soviet Govern-ment would make some contribution to the Polish settlement. He had mentionedLwow, and there was also the question of some of the oil-bearing lands. It wouldbe a great help if some such alteration at the southern end of the Curzon Linecould be considered to counterbalance the loss of Konigsberg.The most important point was a permanent Government for Poland. Thegeneral opinion in the United States was against recognising the Lublin Govern-ment, on the grounds that it represented only a small section of Poland and ofthe Polish nation. There was a demand for the creation of a Government ofnational unity, which would resolve the present difficulties. Such a government might be composed of the representatives of the five main political parties.Continuing, the President said that he knew none of the members of thepresent Polish Governments in London or in Lublin. He had met M. Mikolajczykwhen he had come to Washington (at that time he was still a Minister) and hadbeen greatly impressed by him, and had felt that he was an honest man. he therefore hoped to see the creation of a Government of Poland which would be representative and would have the support of the great majority of Poles, evenif it was only an interim Government. There were many ways in which such aGovernment might be created. One of many suggestions made had been thepossibility of creating a property ^dp-qtial Council, composed of a small number of
men, who would exercise interim control and be charged with the duty of settingup a more permanent Government.These suggestions came admittedly from one who lived 3,000 miles away, butdistance was sometimes an advantage. He need not add that the United Stateswished to see Poland on thoroughly friendly terms with Russia in the years tocome that was essential.MARSHAL STALIN said that he hoped that the Polish Government wouldbe on friendly terms with all the Allies.THE PRESIDENT said that, if something on these lines could be worked out, it would make the securing of the future peace of the world an easier thing.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was his duty to state the position ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government. He had repeatedly declared in Parliament and in public his resolution to support the claim of the U.S.S.R. to the Curzon Line asinterpreted by the Soviet Government. That meant including Lwow in theU.S.S.R. He had been considerably criticised in Parliament (as had the foreign secretary) and by the Conservative Party for this attitude. But he had alwaystaken the view that, after the great agonies which Russia had suffered in defending herself against Germany, and the great deeds that Russia hadperformed in driving away the Germans and liberating Poland, Russia&apos;s claimto the Curzon Line, including Lwow, was founded not on force but on right.The Prime Minister said that he remained of that view. If, however, amighty Power like Russia were to make a gesture of magnanimity to a muchweaker Power, and were to make some territorial concession, such as suggestedby the President, he need not say how much we should both admire and acclaimthe Soviet action.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that he was more interested to see astrong, free and independent Poland than he was in particular territorialboundaries. He wanted the Poles to be in a position to live freely and to livetheir own lives in their own way. That was the object which he had alwaysheard Marshal Stalin proclaim with the utmost firmness. It was because he puthis trust in the Marshal&apos;s declarations as to the sovereignty, independence and freedom of Poland, that he did not consider the frontier question to be one of supreme importance.It was this which was so dear to the hearts of the British nation and theBritish Commonwealth of Nations. It was for this that we had gone to war against Germany that Poland should be free and sovereign. Everyone knew what a terrible risk we had taken when we had gone to war in 1939 although soill-armed. This action had nearly cost us our life, not only as an Empire but as a nation.Great Britain had no material interest of any kind in Poland. Our soleinterest was one of honour, because_ we had drawn the sword to help Polandagainst Hitler&apos;s brutal onslaught. We could never be content with any settle-ment which did not leave Poland a free and independent sovereign State.The Prime Minister said that he would add one qualification to this state-ment. Freedom for Poland could not be made to cover any hostile design byPoland or by any Polish group, possibly in intrigue with Germany, against russia. He made this reservation, but he could not conceive that the world organisation that was being set up would ever tolerate such action or that itwould be left to Soviet Russia alone to take action against it. Subject to this reservation, it was our earnest desire that Poland should be mistress in her ownhouse and captain of her own soul.The Prime Minister said that he earnestly hoped that we should not separatewithout taking a practical step towards this object. At the present time therewere two Governments of Poland about which we held different views. He hadnot seen any of the present London Government of Poland. We recognised thatGovernment, but had not sought their company. On the other hand, Mikolajczyk,Romer and -Grabski were men of good sense and honesty, and with them we had remained in informal but friendly and close relations.The Prime Minister said that it seemed to him to be a source of criticismagainst the Three Great Powers if they allowed the existence of these two rivalGovernments to be a cause of apparent division between them, when there were such great tasks in hand and they had such hopes in common. Would it not bepossible at this Conference to create a government or governmental instrument ofPoland, which should continue pending full and free elections, and which could
be recognised by all the Great Powers and also by the other States which had not withdrawn recognition from the London Government of Poland. This Govern-ment would be charged with preparing the way for a free vote of the Polishpeople on their future Constitution and Administration. If this could be done,we should have taken one great step forward towards the future peace and prosperity of Central Europe. He was sure that effective guarantees could^ belaid down which would secure what was required for the lines of communication of the Russian army now driving forward in victorious pursuit of the Germans.. These, the Prime Minister concluded, were the points which he and thePresident wished to put forward to their Ally that evening.The Conference then adjourned for 10 minutes.MARSHAL STALIN said that the Prime Minister had stated that poland was for His Majesty&apos;s Government a question of honour. He understood that point of view. For Russia, Poland was both a question of honour and also aquestion of security. It was a question of honour because the Russians had. hadmany conflicts with the Poles and the Soviet Government wished to eliminatethese conflicts. But it was also a question of security, not only because poland was on the frontiers of Russia, but because throughout history Poland had been acorridor through which Russia&apos;s enemies.had passed to attack her. Duringthe last thirty years the Germans had twice passed through this corridor. Theypassed through because Poland had been weak. Russia wanted to see a strong and powerful Poland so that she would be able, of her own strength, to shut thiscorridor. This corridor could not be shut by mechanical means from outside by russian forces. It could only be shut from the inside by the forces of Polandherself, and it was for this reason that it was necessary that Poland should be free, independent and powerful. This was a matter of life and death for theSoviet State. The policy of Russia to-day differed greatly from that of Russiaunder the Czarist Government. That Government had wanted to suppress andassimilate Poland. The policy of Russia to-day was completely changed. Theyhad started a policy of friendship, and friendship, moreover, with an independentPoland. That was the whole basis of the Russian policy towards Poland, namely,that they wanted to see Poland independent, free and strong.Marshal Stalin said that he would now deal with the questions which hadbeen raised and on which the Russians had different views from their Allies.The President had suggested there should be some modification of the curzon line and that Lwow and perhaps certain other districts should be given to Poland.The Prime Minister had suggested that this would be a gesture of magnanimityon the part of Russia, but he must remind the President and the Prime minister that the Curzon Line had not been invented by the Russians. It had been drawnup by Curzon and Clemenceau and those representatives of the United states who took part in the conference in 1918, at which Russia was not represented,and, indeed, to which she had not been invited. The Curzon Line had beenaccepted against the will of Russia on the basis of ethnographical data. Leninhad not agreed with the Curzon Line. He did not wish to see the town andprovince of Bialystok given to Poland. The Russians had already retired fromthe position on which Lenin had taken his stand, and now some people wantedRussia to take less than Lord Curzon and Clemenceau had conceded to Russia.This would be a shameful course. The Ukrainians when they came to Moscowwould say that Stalin and Molotov were less reliable defenders of Russia thanCurzon or Clemenceau. He could not take up such a position, and return to moscow with an open face. It was better that the war should continue a littlelonger, although it would cost Russia much blood, in order that Poland shouldbe given compensation at the expense of Germany. When Mikolajczyk had beenin Russia during the Prime Minister&apos;s last visit, he had asked what frontierfor Poland Russia would recognise in the West, and he had been delighted to hear that Russia thought that the Western frontier of Poland should be extendedto the Neisse, There were two such rivers, one near Breslau, another furtherwest. It was the western of these two rivers he had in mind, and he asked theConference to support his proposal.He now turned to the Polish Government. The Prime Minister had saidthat it would be a good thing if we could create a Polish Government at theConference. This must be a slip of the tongue, since without the participation of the Poles, we could not create a Government. (The Prime Minister indicated that he assented.) Continuing, MARSHAL STALIN said that he was sometimesaccused of being a dictator, but he had enough democratic feeling not to allow
himself to embark on the task of creating a Polish Government without the Polesthemselves. Such a Government could only be created with the participationand assent of the Poles.During the Prime Ministers visit to Moscow, M. Mikolajczyk andM. Grabski had come to Moscow and a meeting had been arranged between themand members of the Lublin Government, and this had provided an opportunityof creating a united Government. On certain points agreement had been reached.M. Mikolajczyk had then gone to London on the understanding that he would return to Moscow, but shortly afterwards he had been turned out of office. Thereason was that he was in favour of agreement with the Lublin Government.The present Polish Government in London under the present Prime Ministerand President, were all hostile to the very idea of such an agreement, and theydescribed the members of the Lublin Government as bandits and criminals.Naturally, the Lublin Government paid them back in their own coin, and ithad become very difficult to do anything to bring about an arrangement in such circumstances.The members of the Lublin Government (or Warsaw Government as it should now be called) did not want anything to do with the Polish Government inLondon. He had asked them what concessions they could make. They had repliedthat they could tolerate and take into the Government General Zeligowski andM. Grabski. They would not hear of M. Mikolajczyk becoming Prime Minister.In these circumstances he was prepared to support any attempt to create unityif that attempt had any likelihood of success. If the President and PrimeMinister liked to ask members of the Lublin Government to come down to talkto them, or would like to meet them in Moscow, that could be arranged. But hethought it necessary to say frankly that the Warsaw Government had, at anyrate, as much democratic basis in Poland as General de Gaulle had in Prance.As a military man, he, Stalin, wished to state what demands he must makein regard to the government of the territories liberated by the Red Army. Themain requirement was that there should be no civil war behind the Army, butpeace and quiet. The Lublin Government fulfilled this role reasonably well. Onthe other hand, there were agents in Poland of the London Government. Theseagents were connected with the underground forces which were called the Forcesof Resistance. Nothing good came from these underground forces, but much evil.So far, these agents of the London Government had killed 212 Russian troops.They had also raided supply dumps in order to get arms.Again it had been announced that all radio stations behind the lines shouldbe registered and only function when permission had been obtained. But this regulation had been constantly infringed. It was not surprising in thesecircumstances that some of these men were arrested. He must make it clear thatattacks by these men on the Red Army could not be allowed and those whoattempted them would be shot. Military law was in operation. When he corn-pared what the agents of the Lublin Government and of the London government did in the rear of the Red Army, he found that the former were useful and thatthe latter were not. In a word, the military authorities were greatly interestedin peace and quiet behind the lines. This was for them of the utmost importance and, as a military man, he would support that authority which would ensure it.That then was the situation.THE PRESIDENT suggested that the Conference should adjourn until thefollowing day.THE PRIME MINISTER jsaid that he thought that he should put it on record that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Governments had different sources of information in Poland and had received different accounts of what had happened. According to information at their disposal, the Lublin Governmentcould not be regarded as representing more than one-third of the Polish people ifthey were free to express their opinion. This, of course, was based on the bestinformation which we could obtain and we might be mistaken in certainparticulars, and the Marshal knew we had been greatly disturbed at the fear thatthe Polish Underground Army might come into collision with the representativesof the Lublin Government. We had greatly feared that these collisions would lead to bitterness and bloodshed which would result in arrests and deportationsand it was for this reason that we had been so anxious for a joint arrangement.We greatly feared the effect which all this would have on the Polish questionwhich was already difficult enough.[29177]    &apos; f
THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was recognised, of course, that who-ever attacked the Red Army must be punished. But he could not feel that theLublin Government had a right to say that they represented the Polish nationaccording to the facts at his disposal.THE PRESIDENT said that Poland had been a source of trouble for over500 years.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we must do what we could to put anend to these troubles.The Conference then adjourned.ANNEX.Proposed Formula for Voting Procedure in the Security Council of theUnited Nations Organisation and Analysis of the Effects of thatFormula.*I. Proposed formula as communicated on the 5th December, 1944, to marshal Stalin and to Prime Minister Churchill (with a minor clarification ofthe reference to Chapter VIII, Section C).The provisions of Section C of Chapter VI of the Dumbarton Oaks proposals would read as follows : &quot; C.-Voting.1. Each member of the Security Council should have one vote.21 Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters should bemade by an affirmative vote of seven members.3. Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters should be madeby an affirmative vote of seven members, including the concurring votes ofthe permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VIII,Section A, and under the second sentence of paragraph 1 of Chapter VIII,Section C, a party to a dispute should abstain from voting.&quot;II. Analysis of effect of above formula on principal substantive decisions on which the Security Council would have to vote.Under the above formula the following decisions would require the affirmative votes of seven members of the Security Council, including the votes of all the permanent members : -I. Recommendations to the General Assembly on (1) Admission of new members.(2) Suspension of a member.(3) Expulsion of a member.(4) Election of the Secretary-General.II. Restoration of the rights and privileges of a suspended member.III. Removal of threats to the peace and suppression of breaches ofthe peace, including the following questions : (1) Whether failure on the part of the parties to a dispute to settle it by means of their own choice or in accordance with therecommendations of the Security Council in fact constitutes a threat to the peace.(2) Whether any other actions on the part of any country constitute a threat to the peace or a breach of the peace.. (3) What measures should be taken by the Council to maintain or restore the peace and the manner in which such measures should, becarried out.(4) Whether a regional agency should be authorised to take measures of enforcement.IV. Approval of special agreement or agreements for the provision of armed forces and facilities.
V. Formulation of plans for a general system of regulation of arma-ments and submission of such plans to the member States.VI. Determination of whether the nature and the activities of a regional agency or arrangement for the maintenance of peace and securityare consistent with the purposes and principles of the general organisation.The following decisions relating to peaceful settlement of disputes would also require the affirmative votes of seven members of the Security Council includingthe votes of all the permanent members, except that a member of the council would not cast its vote in any such decisions that concern disputes to which it is a party:-I. Whether a dispute or a situation brought to the Council&apos;s attention is of such a nature that its continuation is likely to threaten thepeace.II.   Whether the Council should call on the parties to settle or adjust thedispute or situation by means of their own choice,III. Whether the Council should make a recommendation to the parties asto methods and procedures of settlement.IV. Whether the legal aspects of the matter before it should be referred bythe Council for advice to the international court of justice.V. Whether, if there exists a regional agency for peaceful settlement oflocal disputes, such an agency should be asked to concern itself withthe controversy.[29177]
F.S.M. (Argonaut) 5th Meeting.7 th February, 1945.RECORD OF A MEETING HELD AT YUSUPOV VILLA AT 12 noon on 7th FEBRUARY, 1945.Present:Mr. Eden.Sir A. Cadogan.Sir A. Clark Kerr.Mr. Jebb. *Mr. Dixon.Mr. Harrison.Mr. R. Allen.Major Theakstone (interpreter).Mr.- Stettinius.Mr. Harriman.Mr. Matthews.Mr. Hiss.Mr. Page (interpreter).M. Molotov.M. Vyshinski.&quot;M, Maisky.M. Gousev.M. Novikov.M. Golunski (interpreter).1. Dismemberment of Germany.M.-MOLOTOV said that it had been agreed at the Plenary Meetingof the previous day that the only amendment to Article 12 (a) of the draftInstrument of Surrender should be the insertion of the word &quot; dismemberment.&quot;It was agreed that the exact drafting of the Article should be settled bySir A. Cadogan, M. Vyshinski and Mr. Matthews. (This was done immediatelyafter the meeting.)M. MOLOTOV said that the second question on the Agenda concerned the setting up of a commission to study dismemberment. He proposed that acommission should be set up for this purpose in London consisting of Mr. Edenas Chairman, together with the United States and Soviet Ambassadors in London.Mr. STETTINIUS feared that if this task were not given to the european advisory Commission, its prestige would be lessened.Mr. EDEN said that while he was touched at the suggestion that he shouldpreside over such a commission and work with the colleagues proposed, he thoughtthat the advantage in referring the matter to the European Advisory Commissionlay in the fact that the French would be present there.Mr. STETTINIUS said that was just the point in not referring it to theEuropean Advisory Commission. It would be agreeable to the United StatesGovernment that studies of dismemberment should be carried out in London, andthat their representative on the proposed commission should be Mr. Winant.M. MOLOTOV thought that since the body concerned would be consideringthe procedure to be followed in dismembering Germany, it would be better to setup a special commission. The matter might perhaps be referred later to theEuropean Advisory Commission.Mr. EDEN hoped that the body would go further than merely the considera-tion of procedure. . He then read out a suggested Terms of Reference (see annex I)-Mr. STETTINIUS and M. MOLOTOV both agreed with the suggestedTerms of Reference.Mr. EDEN said that the point that they had to decide was whether theproposed body was to do the work of studying dismemberment, or whether itwas merely to decide how that work was to be done.
After some further discussion, it was agreed that no directive had beenissued at the Plenary Meeting that a special body should be set up. Nevertheless,it would be desirable for an examination of the problem to be carried out inLondon.Mr. EDEN said that he was, worried at the idea that the French should notbe brought in. The French after all were neighbours of Germany and we knew that they had ideas about the future of the Rhineland. We might or might not agree with those ideas, but if we kept the French out of these discussions, he considered that we should be making a grave mistake.M. MOLOTOV said that the question of the participation of France mightbe discussed by the body studying dismemberment.Mr. STETTINIUS agreed to this, and it was finally agreed that thecommission proposed by M. Molotov should carry out the study of dismembermentin London, but that, at Mr. Eden&apos;s request, the latter should be at liberty toappoint a deputy if his duties should not allow him to preside in person overthe commission.2. French Participation in the Control Commission for Germany.M. MOLOTOV put forward a written proposal agreeing to the allotmentto France of a separate zone of occupation in Germany and suggesting that theFrench occupation authorities should exercise control in their zone under thegeneral guidance of the Control Commission.Mr. EDEN said that he hoped that his colleagues would consider again the advisability of letting the French participate in the Control Commission.He feared all sorts of difficulties if this was refused them. It might be thatGeneral de Gaulle would refuse to accept a zone if he were not treated on thesame footing as the three Great Powers. If he did so, many people in GreatBritain would consider him justified. Even if he did accept a zone, therewould be constant trouble if the French were not represented on the control commission. General de Gaulle was capable of snapping his fingers at us whenonce he had got a zone. What action could we then take ? He himself could not see that it was as great a step to agree to have the French on the control commission as it had been to have them on the European Advisory Commission.The Prime Minister was opposed to including the French at present at suchconferences as the present one, but a French seat on the Control commission would not involve their presence at these conferences.M. MOLOTOV said that our present proposals provided for a Commissionheaded by the three Commanders-in-Chief of the three Powers. This machinerycould deal with the French zone and it would not be advisable to change thearrangements which had been agreed.Mr. STETTINIUS said that he was impressed by the difficulties to which mr. Eden had drawn attention in controlling the French if they had norepresentative on the Control Commission. Would it not be possible to agreenow to the French having a zone and to postpone the question of participation in the Control Commission?Mr. EDEN thought that the French would certainly ask for a place on theCommission as soon as they were given a zone.Mr. STETTINIUS suggested that the matter could then be referred to theEuropean Advisory Commission.After some further discussion, Mr. EDEN suggested that they should reportto the Plenary Meeting tha\ the British considered that the French should beaccepted forthwith as members of the Control Commission, whilst the americans and the Russians considered that no decision on this point need be taken as yet.Mr. STETTINIUS said that the report should add that he and M. Molotovfelt that the matter should be referred to the European Advisory commission for further study.Mr. EDEN suggested that they might add that it was the British view that whilst the French should have a seat, no other Governments should be given aseat on the Commission or a zone.It was agreed to report on these lines.
3. Reparation.M. MOLOTOV put forward two documents (see Annex II) (a) Basic Principles of Exaction of Reparations from Germany; and(b) Organisation of an Allied Reparations Committee.He suggested that Document (a) should be discussed first and gave a shortexplanation. The total sum fixed was 20 billion dollars. The basic principlegoverning the allocation of reparation was contained in the first paragraph. TheSoviet Government considered it only fair that a distribution should be made asbetween the U.S.S.R. on &quot;the one hand and the United States of America and theUnited Kingdom on the other. The Soviet Government accordingly proposedthat 10 billion dollars should be allocated to Russia, and 8 billion betweenthe United States and the United Kingdom. The form which reparation tookmight be different for different countries. For instance, the United States andthe United Kingdom might not be interested in factories and machine tools but rather in raw materials and German shares in foreign countries. He then called on M. Maisky to explain the Soviet plan in greater detail.M. MAISKY explained how the figure of 20 billion dollars was arrived at.He suggested that reparations could be divided into two main parts : (1) equip-ment, machine tools and so on, and (2) annual payments in kind. It was estimatedthat the first of these would yield about 10 billion dollars, and that the second would yield a similar sum over a period of ten years, giving an annual yield of1 billion dollars. The Russian calculations had been made on the following basis.The national wealth of Germany before the war was 125 billion dollars. As aresult of the war and post-war difficulties this figure would be reduced by about40 per cent., leaving some 75 billion dollars. An analysis of the industrial wealthof a highly industrialised country showed that what might be called the mobileproportion of this wealth was about 25 per cent, of the total, Le., in the case ofGermany, 22-23 billion dollars. Of this the Russians proposed that 10 billiondollars should be taken. This would leave Germany sufficient to exist on &quot;a modest and decent Central European level.&quot;As regards the second 10 billion dollars, the German national income beforethe war was 30 billion dollars a year. After the war it would be lower by30-35 per cent., leaving an annual income of 18-20 billion dollars. Of this, itwas proposed that 1 billion dollars should be taken every year, i.e., 5 per cent,or 6 per cent, of the total national income. It was considered that germany could easily carry such a burden.Mr. EDEN said that he hoped that he would not be expected to say then andthere whether or not he approved this document. He had not been able to givethe profound study to this problem which M. Maisky had evidently given. Therewas, however, one point to which he would like at once to draw attention. ThePrime Minister, at the conclusion of the discussion in the Plenarv Meeting&apos;, had said that it was for consideration whether exertion in the war or sufferingsendured at the hands of the enemy should be the basis for the allocation of reparation. On either basis, Russia would stand well. He would have preferredthe definition in the first paragraph of the first Soviet document to include thelatter basis as well as the former, in order to avoid the impression that theGreat Powers were taking all and not leaving much for those who had sufferedmuch.Without in any way committing himself to the figures contained in theRussian.proposals, he was nevertheless inclined to agree in principle with para-graph 2 of the proposals.Mr. STETTINIUS complimented M. Maisky on his able exposition. Hethought that the document should be studied carefully before comments weremade. His Delegation were prepared to do this promptly and to discuss thematter in detail later in the Conference. He would like, however, to recall thatthe President had stated that the United States were interested in no reparationother than German investments, and possibly raw materials. He himself wouldbe surprised if the total share required by the United States would approachanything like one-half of the allotment which the Russians had made to the UnitedStates of America and the United Kingdom. He hoped that we could reportto the Plenary Meeting that the matter had been discussed and that it had beenagreed that a commission should be established in Moscow to go to workimmediately.
M. MOLOTOV suggested that discussion of the question should be resumedwhen the Americans and the British had had time to study the Russian draft. Hehad no objection meanwhile to the addition to paragraph 1 of a clause on thelines suggested by Mr. Eden. As regards the division of their share betweenthe United States of America and the United Kingdom, that was their business,but the Soviet Government had thought it right to make their suggestion aboutthe allocation of the sum received in view of the losses suffered by those countries and of the fact that if nothing were said about their share, the peoples in theUnited States of America and the United Kingdom would ask why their countries had been omitted.He therefore proposed that the meeting should report that a start had beenmade with this problem, that it should be studied further, and that a ReparationCommission should be established in Moscow to get to work immediately.M. MOLOTOV then suggested that the second document should be studied.After some slight amendments, it was agreed that this document was acceptable, provided that the phrase &apos;&apos; principles adopted &apos;&apos; in paragraph 2 didnot mean that the details of the Russian proposals had been agreed.Mr. EDEN then raised the question whether the proposed reparations commission in Moscow should not examine the control of German industry inrelation to future security. If so, should not this matter be included in the Termsof Reference of the Commission?M. MOLOTOV thought that the Commission would be bound to deal with german industry. It should keep in mind the question of security, although thiswould not be its principal task.Mr. STETTINIUS said that, in practice, liaison would have to beestablished between the Reparations Commission in Moscow and the european advisory Commission or the Control Commission for Germany, in order to make sure that there was full integration between their respective plans.It was agreed that a report should be drafted on the lines of the discussionfor submission to the Plenary Meeting the same afternoon.ANNEX I.Suggested Terms of Reference for Commission on Dismemberment.(1) On the assumption that Germany is to be split up, if necessary by force,into separate States to examine (a) at what point of time the operation should becarried out; (b) what the boundaries of the States should be; (c) what measures would need to be taken by the occupying forces to ensure the more or less efficientfunctioning and survival of the States; and (d) what relationship should beallowed amongst the separate States and with other foreign Powers.(2) To submit a factual report indicating the advantages and disadvantages of the above mentioned scheme from the point of view of general security.ANNEX II.(a) Basic Principles of Exaction of Reparations from Germany.1. Reparations are to be received in the first instance by those countrieswhich have borne the main burden of the war and have organised victory overthe enemy.All other countries are to receive reparations in the second place.2. Setting aside for the moment the use of German labour by way of reparations, this question to be considered at a later date, reparations in kindare to be exacted from Germany in the two following forms : (a) Removals in a single payment at the end of the war from the national wealth of Germany located on the territory of Germany herself aswell as outside her territory (equipment, machine-tools, ships, rolling-stock, German investments abroad, shares of industrial^ transport,shipping and other enterprises remaining in Germany, &amp;c), these
removals to be carried out for the purpose of the military and economicdisarmament of Germany.These removals are to be completed within two years of the endof the war.(b) Annual deliveries of commodities during 10 years after the end ofthe war.3. The total sum of the German reparations in the form of removals from her national wealth as well as in the form of annual deliveries of commoditiesafter the end of the war is fixed at 20 billion dollars.This amount shall be distributed as follows : (a) U.S.S.R.-10 billion dollars.(b) United Kingdom and United States 8 billion dollars.(c) All other countries 2 billion dollars.(b) Terms of Reference of an Allied Reparation Committee.The Allied Reparation Committee shall be set up on the following basis : 1. The Committee shall consist of three representatives, one from U.S.S.R.,the United Kingdom and United States.

Molotov thereupon read out the following statement: 1. Regarding the Dismemberment of Gebmany.(a) A. Y. Vyshinski, Sir A. Cadogan and Mr. Matthews were entrusted with the preparation of the final draft of Article 12 of the instrument&quot; Unconditional Surrender of Germany,&quot; having in view the insertion in the text of Article 12 of the word &quot; dismemberment.&quot;(b) The study of the procedure for the dismemberment of Germany was referred to a committee consisting of Mr. Eden, Mr. Winant and F. T. Gousev.2. Regarding a Zone of Occupation in Germany for France.(a) The allocation to France of a zone in Germany to be occupied by french forces was agreed upon.(b) As regards the participation of France in the Control Commission,M. Molotov and Mr. Stettinius felt it desirable to refer the question to theE.A.C. Mr. Eden thought that the question of the admission of France tothe Control Commission should be settled at this conference.3. Regarding the Reparation to be made by Germany.(a) It was agreed that in paragraph 1 of the Soviet proposals mentionshould also be made of sacrifices borne.(b) Tt was decided that the Reparation Committee should meet in moscow.. It was agreed that the Committee should begin its work as soonas the principles upon which reparation should be made had been approved[29177]    - g
(c) It was decided that the discussion of the two documents relating to reparations which had been - submitted by M. Molotov, first, regarding the basic principles of exacting the reparations from Germany, and, second,regarding the organisation of an Allied Reparation Committee, should becontinued at the Crimea Conference.THE PRESIDENT said that he was very grateful to the Committee fortheir work.THE PRIME MINISTER joined with the President in thanking theCommittee. He had only that moment heard the translation of the conclusionsat which the Committee had arrived. With one exception, they seemed to himsatisfactory, but he would like to see the English translation in writing and give his final answer on the following day.French Zone of Occupation.On the question of whether France should&apos; be given a zone of occupation inGermany, but not have a place on the Control Commission, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment remained unconvinced. No solution had been found for controlling theFrench in their control of the Germans in their zone. If they undertook a zone and wanted to be tiresome, they could easily produce a regime in that zone whichwould cause discontent in the other zones. If the others were strict, they couldbe lenient and vice versa. There must be uniformity in the treatment of germany by the four Allies as far as possible. Otherwise there would be endless pettydisputes and many Germans would want to go from one part to another, and one part would be held up as a model to the others, and so. on. The Prime Ministerregarded the Allied Control Commission for Germany as an instrument sub-ordinate to the will of the Governments. In principle its position was no morethan that pi the Allied Control Commission in Italy, though it would, of course,deal with more important matters. He did not consider that French participa-tion on it would give them any right to take part in a conference such as thepresent one. That was for the three Great Powers to decide. But the whole ofthis argument seemed to him beside the point, since he was certain that the french would not take any zone unless they had a place on the Control Commission. he himself thought they were quite right. Who would they get their directionsfrom? For these reasons he did not think that the proposed plan would work.Nor did he think it was any use handing over something which they could notsettle here themselves to a much weaker body on which the French were repre-sented. A deadlock would undoubtedly result, and the matter would be referred back to the three of them present at this meeting. Why not therefore settle thequestion here before parting? He thought they might think over it again andthen settle it at this conference.THE PRESIDENT suggested that they might let it rest for several weeks,and proceed to allocate a zone immediately to the French.THE PRIME MINISTER said that once they separated, he did not know what would happen, as correspondence on a matter such as this might drag on for months.MARSHAL STALIN said that they had settled many questions bycorrespondence.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, but he thought that did not apply to themost difficult questions. He repeated his request that the matter should be looked at again in a day or two.MARSHAL STALIN said that the European Advisory Commission could also hear what France had to say.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he could tell Marshal Stalin what thatwould be at once. One thing which he did not want was to have the French in onour tripartite meetings for some considerable time, at any rate, and this con-cession would satisfy their amour propre for some time. *THE PRESIDENT agreed that the French should not be admitted tomeetings of the three Great Powers, but he doubted if this concession would satisfy their amour propre.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that theirs was a very exclusive club andthat the entrance subscription was the possession of at least five million soldiersor their equivalent.The CONFERENCE took note that the Prime Minister would give hisanswer on the.Foreign Secretaries&apos; report on the following day asregards Dismemberment of Germany and Reparations; and agreed thatthe question of the French Zone of Occupation should be put on the list of matters to be raised again before the conference separated.2. Persia.. THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the. question of Persia. There were a number of complicated issues, not of the first importance, and he suggested thatthese should be remitted for consideration by the Foreign Secretaries.THE PRESIDENT and MARSHAL STALIN agreed with this course.3. Economic Affairs.Countries with low Purchasing Power.THE PRESIDENT said that the question of Persia brought to his mind forcibly the question of the exchange of goods throughout the world,particularly in regard to countries which had little or no purchasing power and could not buy British, American or Soviet goods. Persia was an outstandingexample of this, but all over the world there were millions of people withoutpurchasing power. If they wanted to see more trade in the world, then theymust concern themselves with those areas which were unable to buy anythingat the present time. That was another reason why the United Nations Organisa-tion should come into existence as soon as possible. A world-wide study shouldbe made of how those nations which had no purchasing power could be enabled to get it. History showed that Persia was once well wooded; and as a resultthere had been surface water available and no soil erosion; and the people had had a reasonable standard of living. Now Persia was the poorest place he hadever seen. That was why he hoped that the world organisation would concern itself with those peoples who had no goods or cash with which to take part in world trade. There were parallel cases in Europe. Some areas had coal orcheap power which they obtained from water. Some areas had much andothers little or none. Why should those countries that had coal or water have such tremendous advantages over their neighbours who had none ? The SovietGovernment were thinking in those sort of terms and in the United States theyhad the Tennessee Valley Authority and similar sources of electric powerextending throughout the whole country.At this point the meeting turned to the consideration of other matters.4. World Organisation.Voting on the Security Council.M. MOLOTOV said, that on the previous day the. Conference had hearda very full report from Mr&apos;. Stettinius. The Russian Delegation were satisfied with that report, and they had also received explanations of certain points arisingout of the report. As a result, the position was much clearer to them. They had also been greatly impressed by what the Prime Minister had said Jon theprevious day.The position which they had taken up at the Dumbarton Oaks conference was that they aimed at securing the maximum of unity among the three great powers on all questions of security and peace after the war. The scheme whichhad emerged from the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, as modified by the UnitedStates suggestions as to voting on the Security Council, was in their view wellcalculated to secure collaboration between all nations both great and small afterthe war. They were, therefore, ready to accept the Dumbarton Oaks proposalssubject to the revised formula for voting procedure in the Security Council.Complete unanimity and understanding in this matter had been established between the three Great Powers.[29177] g 2
Membership of Constituent Soviet Republics.M. Molotov added that there was one matter which had been raised atDumbarton Oaks and not settled there and which he must touch on. This affected the question whether the Soviet republics should participate as original membersof the security organisation. Those present would be familiar with the Russianviews which were based on the modifications made in the Soviet constitution inFebruary 1944. The Russian point of view had been explained at DumbartonOaks, and the Russians knew the point of view of the United States and GreatBritain. They considered that this matter should be reviewed at the present conference.The Soviet Delegation did not, however, intend to raise this question inthe same form as at Dumbarton Oaks. They would consider it fair if three oftheir republics, or at any rate two, were to be accepted as original members. Therepublics they had in mind were the Ukraine, White Russia and Lithuania. all three, they felt, were fully qualified to be original members of the world organisa-tion. It was unnecessary for him to explain the importance of the Ukraine in size, population or economic resources. Nor need he emphasise the importanceof White Russia or Lithuania as States significant from the point of view offoreign relations. All three republics had made great sacrifices in the war; theyhad been the first to be invaded by the enemy and their peoples had sufferedgreatly. It would be fair and reasonable that three of these republics, or at anyrate two of them, should be accepted as original members of the Assembly.The Dominions of the British Commonwealth had approached independencegradually, and had exercised great patience in this respect. This was an example to Russia and they had decided to withdraw their original, and wider, proposal and to put forward the present much narrower proposal, which seemed to themreasonable.To sum up M. Molotov said that they were in full agreement with theproposal put forward by the President as to the voting procedure, and they asked that three, or at any rate two, of their republics should be original members ofthe international security organisation.THE PRESIDENT said that he was delighted that M. Molotov had said thathe accepted the plan which he (the President) had put forward. This markedgreat progress. Agreement had now been reached about the new world organisa-tion, but it remained to set it up. The next step, therefore, was to invite thenations to come together to a meeting for this purpose. For what date should the invitations be issued ? There was a strong sentiment in the United States thatthe meeting to set up the new organisation should be held as early as possible,say, at the end of March. Physically, it would be possible for representatives ofthe nations to meet in a month&apos;s time.A question would also arise as to the nations who should be invited to theConference. Clearly invitations would go to all the nations which had taken partin the war against Germany. It would also have to be settled whether invitationsshould be sent to the associated nations, who had broken off relations withGermany, but had not taken part in the war, e.g., Paraguay, Chile or Egypt.The question raised by M. Molotov as to whether two or three of the Sovietrepublics should be original members had been of great interest to him, and wasone which would have to be taken up and dealt with at the proposed organisationmeeting. This issue affected each of the three Great Powers in different ways,because the position of each was quite different. Thus, the Union of soviet socialist Republics contained great masses of people such as the Republics ofthe Ukraine, White Russia and Lithuania. The British Empire contained largeindependent groups of peoples, such as Australia and Canada, living in. widelyseparated countries. The United States, on the other hand, was territorially asingle continuous unit, and had no colonies. Its people spoke one language andits Constitution provided that it should have a single Foreign Minister. Then,again, there were countries like Brazil, territorially smaller indeed than Russia,but larger than the United States. At the other end of the scale there were anumber of very small States. The question raised by M. Molotov seemed to himto involve the question whether it was possible to concede his claim withoutdeparting from the principle that each nation in the World Assembly had asingle vote; or whether what was really involved was a suggestion that thelarger nations of the world should have more than one vote in the Assembly.In conclusion, THE PRESIDENT said that he thought that if agreement could be reached on a plan for an organisation meeting of the United Nations,
the three Foreign Secretaries might perhaps meet before the Meeting and considerM. Molotov&apos;s proposals and the point at issue could be taken up and dealt with at the organisation meeting.His immediate proposal, therefore, was to refer to a meeting of the threeForeign Secretaries &apos;(a) the question of membership of the Assembly.   This would include thequestion raised by M. Molotov; and(b) the question of the time and place for the organisation meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed his heartfelt thanks to Marshal Stalinand the Soviet Government for the great step forward which they had taken tomeet the views put forward by President Roosevelt as to voting on the security council of the World Organisation. The agreement of the three Great powers which had been reached round the table that afternoon would give relief andsatisfaction to people all over the world.As regards membership of the World Organisation, the suggestion justput forward by M. Molotov differed greatly from the previous suggestion madeby the Soviet Government.   Everyone must feel that here, also, a remarkableadvance had been made towards general agreement.   He (the Prime Minister)entirely agreed with President Roosevelt that the position of the United Statesdiffered from that of the British Empire in this matter.   Thus, we had fourself-governing Dominions, who, during the last 25 years had played a notablepart in the international organisation of peace which had broken down in 1939.All the four self-governing Dominions had worked for peace and democraticprogress.   When the United Kingdom had declared war against Germany in1939, all of them had sprung to arms, although they knew how weak we were.We had had no means of compelling the Dominions to declare war.   They had done so freely of their own accord, on a matter about which it had only beenpossible to consult them very partially.   We could never agree to any system which excluded the self-governing Dominions from the position they had held and justified for a quarter of a century.   For these reasons he could not buthear the proposals of the Soviet Government with a feeling of profound sympathy.His heart went out to mighty Russia, bleeding from her wounds, but beatingdown the tyrants in her path.  He recognised that a nation of 180 million mightwell look with a questioning eye at the constitutional arrangements of the BritishCommonwealth which resulted in our having more than one voice in the Assembly.He was glad, therefore, that President Roosevelt had given an answer whichcould in no way be regarded as a final negative to the consideration of M. Molotov&apos;proposal.Nevertheless he (the Prime Minister) must not exceed his personal authority as regards the proposal which had only just been put forward.&quot; He would like alittle time to discuss the matter with the Foreign Secretary, and perhaps anopportunity to send a telegram to the British War Cabinet. He hoped, therefore,that he might be excused from giving a final answer on the matter that day.PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT reminded the Prime Minister that his proposal had been that the three Foreign Secretaries should examine the matterand report.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would be glad that the three foreign secretaries should examine these matters; but he felt bound to add that heforesaw difficulties in the organisation meeting, which the President proposed tocall, being held as early as March. At this date, the critical battle againstGermany might well be at its height. Furthermore, the domestic position inEngland was complicated. Our labour shortage was acute, and it was necessaryto take special steps to keep the fighting forces up to strength. Moreover, thecondition of Europe might well make it difficult to hold a satisfactory meeting ofall the United Nations at so early a date. The meeting would be charged withimportant duties, and some of the States of Europe might well still be occupied byGermany at the end of March. It was difficult to see how, in the circumstances,the real views of some countries could find expression on these matters at so earlya date. vTHE PRESIDENT said that it was only proposed to hold an organisationmeeting of the nations who had taken part in the war. Pie reminded the PrimeMinister that at Dumbarton Oaks it had been agreed that there should be an organisation meeting as early as possible. Furthermore, he had his own political difficulties in the United States, and the prospects of obtaining a two-thirds vote
of the Senate in favour of the world organisation were much greater if a vote wastaken while the war was still in progress.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would naturally do what he could tocomply with the Presidents wishes, but he thought it right to put on record thedifficulties which he foresaw. He had already stated that he agreed with the presidents proposal that the Foreign Secretaries should be invited to consider these questions.MARSHAL STALIN said that he also agreed with this suggestion.The three Foreign Secretaries were accordingly invited :-(a) to consider the question of membership of the Assembly of two or three off the Republics of the Soviet Union, raised by M. Molotov;(&amp;) to recommend the time and place at which the organisation conference should be held.5. Poland.At the opening of the meeting THE PRESIDENT said that he wanted to emphasise the very great importance he attached to a solution of the PolishGovernment question. He was not so much^concerned about this frontier or that,but he was concerned about the Government. Neither was he much interestedin the question of continuity; in any case, there had been none since 1939. It was quite within the province of the three leaders to help to set up or in fact to setup for the Poles an interim Government which would see them through until they had a chance to set up a Government of their own. He thought that theConference ought to do something that would come like a breath of fresh air inthe murk that existed at the moment on the Polish question.After some discussion on other matters (see Item I), THE PRESIDENTasked Marshal Stalin whether he would like to add anything to what he had said the previous day.MARSHAL STALIN said that he had to-day received the Presidentsletter (see Annex). It contained a proposal that they should call two represen-tatives from Lublin and two from the forces of the opposition camp, and that inthe presence of these four they should settle the question of a new provisionalGovernment for Poland. If this was successful, the new provisional Governmentshould in the shortest possible time organise elections in Poland. (The PrimeMinister indicated approval.) The letter also proposed that some representativePoles from London, e.g., MM. Mikolajczyk, Grabski and Romer, should also join,and some other elements from Poland too. Marshal Stalin had received this message about one and a half hours previously. He had immediately given instructions that MM. Bierut and Morawski should be found so that he couldtalk to them on the telephone. But he learned that at that moment they were inCracow and Lodz, and he would like to ask them, when they were found, howrepresentatives of the other side could be found and what they thought of thepossibility of their coming to this meeting. After that had been done, he wouldbe able to tell how soon they could arrive. If Witos and Sapieha could also come,that would facilitate the matter, but he did not know their addresses and feared that there might not be time to find them. Meanwhile, M. Molotov hadelaborated proposals which met to some extent the proposals of the President.As these proposals were not immediately available, the Conference passed onto other matters (see Items 2, 3 and 4). &quot;When they became available,M. MOLOTOV read them out as follows :-&quot;1. It was agreed that the Curzon Line should be the Eastern frontier of Poland with adjustments in some regions of 5-8 kilometres in favour ofPoland.2. It was decided that the Western frontier of Poland should be drawn from the town of Stettin (Polish) and thence southwards along&apos; the River Oderand the Western Neisse.3. It was considered desirable to add to the Provisional Polish Govern-ment some democratic leaders from Polish emigre circles.4. It was considered desirable that the enlarged Provisional PolishGovernment should be recognised&apos;by the Allied Governments.5. It was considered desirable that the Provisional Polish Govern-ment, enlarged as suggested in paragraph 3, should as soon as possible call the population of Poland to the polls for the establishment by general vote of permanent organs of the Polish Government.
6. M. Molotov, Mr. Harriman and Sir A. Clark Kerr were entrusted with the discussion of the question of enlarging the Provisional PolishGovernment and submitting their proposals for the consideration of thethree Governments.&quot;M. MOLOTOV said that he would like to add a word on the proposals whichhad been put forward by the President. They were now trying to contact thePolish leaders by telephone, but it was very difficult and he feared that therewould not be time for them to come to the Crimea for this Conference. Thesetechnical difficulties made it very improbable that the proposals put forward bythe President could be carried out in time. On the other hand, he thought thatthe proposals he had put forward should meet the wishes of the President andthe Prime Minister.THE PRESIDENT said that they were making definite progress. He wouldlike to have until the following day to consult with Mr. Stettinius, and to considerthe matter further. He said that he did not like the word emigre. He did not know any of the people concerned except Mikolajczyk, but he did not think it wasnecessary to contact only emigres and that people in Poland should also be found.MARSHAL STALIN agreed to defer the discussion until the following day.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he shared the Presidents dislike ofthe word emigre. It was a term which originated with the French who were driven out after the French Revolution and was properly applied only to thosewho had been driven out of their own country by their own people. But the Polesabroad had been driven out of their country by the Germans and he suggestedthat the words &quot; Poles abroad&quot; should be substituted for emigre.(MARSHAL STALIN assented.) The PRIME MINISTER said that, asregards the River Neisse mentioned in the second of M. Molotov&apos;s proposals, hehad in previous talks always qualified the moving of the Polish frontier westwardsby saying that the Poles should be free to take-territory in the West, but notmore than they wished or could properly manage. It would be a great pity tostuff the Polish goose so full of German food that it died of indigestion. He wasconscious of a large body of opinion in Great Britain which was frankly shockedat the idea of moving millions of people by force. He himself was not shocked,but it was certainly a view which would come very much to the fore in GreatBritain. A great success had been achieved in disentangling the Greek and turkish populations after the last war and the two countries had enjoyed good relations ever since; but in that case under a couple of millions of people hadbeen moved. If Poland took East Prussia and Silesia as far as the Oder, it wouldmean moving six million Germans back to Germany. That might be managed,subject to the moral question, which he had to settle with his own people.MARSHAL STALIN observed that no Germans were found in these areas as they had all run away.THE PRIME MINISTER said that that simplified their problem. what had to be considered was whether there was room for them in what was left ofGermany. Six or seven million Germans had been killed and another million or so (Marshal Stalin suggested two millions) would probably be killed before theend of the war. There should therefore be room for these people up to a certainpoint. They would be needed to fill the vacancies. He was not afraid of theproblem of transferring populations, so long as it was proportionate to what thePoles could manage and to what could be put into Germany. But it was a matter which required study, not as a question of principle, but of the numbers whichwould have to be handled. His only other suggestion was that in M. Molotov&apos;sthird proposal the words &quot; and from within Poland itself &quot; should be added.MARSHAL STALIN agreed.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the discussion should be adjournedto the. following day and said that he thought definite progress was being madem this difficult problem.
ANNEX.(See Item 5.)Letter from the President to Marshal Stalin.My dear Marshal Stalin, Mh February, 1945.I have been giving a great deal of thought to our meeting this afternoon,and I want to tell you in all frankness what is on my mind.In so far as the Polish Government is concerned, I am greatly disturbed thatthe three Great Powers do not have a meeting of minds about the political set-upin Poland. It seems to me that it puts all of us in a bad light throughout theworld to have you recognising one Government while we and the Britisu arerecognising another in London. I am sure this state of affairs should not continue and that if it does-it can only lead our people to think there is a breach between us,which is not the case. I am determined that there shall be no breach between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Surely there is a way to reconcile our differences.I was very much impressed with some of the things you said to-day,particularly your determination that your &quot;rear must be safeguarded as yourarmy moves into Berlin. You cannot, and we must not, tolerate any temporaryGovernment which will give your armed forces any trouble of this sort. I wantyou to know that I am fully mindful, of this.You must believe me when I tell you that our people at home look with acritical eye on what they consider a disagreement between us at this vital stage of the war. They, in effect, say that if we cannot get a meeting of minds nowwhen our armies are converging on the common enemy, how can we get an under-standing on even more vital things in the future.I have had to make it clear to you that we cannot recognise the lublin government as now composed, and the world would regard it as a lamentableoutcome of our work here if we parted with an open and obvious breach between us on this issue.You said to-day that you would be prepared to support any suggestions forthe solution of this problem which offered a fair chance of success, and youalso mentioned the possibility of bringing some members of the Lublin Govern-ment here.Realising that we all have the same anxiety in getting this matter settled,I would like to develop your proposal a little and suggest that we invite hereto Yalta at once M. Beirut and M. Osukba Morawski from the Lublin Govern-ment, and also any two of the following list of Poles, which according to our information would be desirable as representatives of the other elements of the Polish people in the development of a new temporary Governmentwhich all three of us could recognise and support: Bishop Sapieha of Cracow,Vincente Witos, M. Zurlowski (Socialist leader), Professor Buyak, and ProfessorKutzeba. If, as a result of the presence of these Polish leaders here, we couldjointly agree with them on a provisional Government in Poland which should no doubt include M. Mikolajczyk, M. Romer and M. Grabski, the United StatesGovernment, and I am sure the British Government as well, would then beprepared to examine with you conditions in which they would dissociate them-selves from the London Government and transfer their recognition to the newprovisional Government.I hope I do not have to assure you that the United States will never lendits support in any way to any provisional Government in Poland that wouldbe inimical to your interests.It goes without saying that any interim Government which could be formedas a result of our conference with the Poles here would be pledged to the holding of free elections in Poland at the earliest possible date. I know this is completelyconsistent with your desire to see a new free and democratic Poland emerge fromthe welter of this war.
F.S.M. (Argonaut) 6th Meeting8th February, 1945.RECORD OF A MEETING HELD AT VORONTSOV AT 12 noon on 8th FEBRUARY, 1945.present mr. Eden.Sir A. Cadogan.Sir A. Clark Kerr.Mr. Jebb (Item 1).Mr. Dixon.Mr. Hankey (Item 3).Mr. R. Allen.Major Theakstone (Interpreter).M. Molotov.M. Vyshinski.M. Gousev.M. Gromyko.M. Golunski (Interpreter)M. Pavlov.Mr. stettinius.Mr. Matthews.Mr. Hiss.Mr. Page (Interpreter).1. World Organisation.Mr. EDEN said that there were two points to be dealt with here, first,the membership of the World Organisation of two or three republics of theSoviet Union, and secondly the time and place at which the organisation conference should be held.Mr. STETTINIUS said that the meeting should also decide who shouldbe invited to the conference. He wished -to invite his Allies to hold a meeting in the United States of America. A time should be fixed which was convenient for Mr. Eden and M. Molotov, but he was anxious that the earliest date possible should be agreed; in any event, he hoped that the date would not be later thanthe latter part of April.As regards those countries who were to be invited, he recalled that therehad been some discussion at Dumbarton Oaks with reference to the Associatednations. The United States Delegation had, however, concluded that it wouldbe most satisfactory to limit the invitations to members of those United nations who had signed the declaration and who had declared war on the common enemy.As regards the question of multiple membership of the U.S.S.R. his feeling was that from the standpoint of geographical area and population, the Sovietsuggestion should be given very sympathetic consideration. He had not, however,yet been able to determine how this proposal could be put into practice at the firstmeeting. Moreover, at Dumbarton Oaks it had been agreed that each sovereign state should have one vote, and he had not been able to see how this agreement could be amended to provide for multiple participation. He wished to referagain to the Presidents reaction to the Soviet proposal, when he had said that itwas most interesting and would deserve sympathetic consideration.M. MOLOTOV asked for Mr. Eden&apos;s ideas on the subject,Mr. EDEN said that as regards the time and place for the Conference, hewould be glad to accept Mr. Stettinius&apos;s invitation. He would, however,, enter onecaveat, namely, that M. Gousev, Mr. Winant and himself were jealous because noconferences ever took place in London. If he and M. Molotov went to theUnited States for this conference, he hoped that it would be possible to arrangefor an early meeting of the Foreign Ministers in London. He added that thiswas an invitation and not an ultimatum.Mr. STETTINUS said that he would promptly accept this invitation.M. MOLOTOV also accepted.MR. EDEN said that as regards the time of the conference, it would benecessary to bring the Chinese and the French into line.   It would be better to get agreement before the meeting if possible.   It would also be necessary to give the[29177] &quot; - H
lawyers ten days or a fortnight, and he thought that he was committed to a debate in Parliament before the meeting. He would therefore like to suggest that themeeting should not take place until the second half of April.M. MOLOTOV said that he agreed.After some further discussion it was agreed that the 25th April would bea suitable date and the invitation to Washington for that date was accepted byMr. Eden and M. Molotov.Mr. EDEN said that as regards the membership of the World Organisation,he was sympathetic towards the inclusion of two of the Soviet republics andwould be ready to say so at whatever was considered the appropriate moment.M. MOLOTOV said that he would like to deal with Mr. Stettinius&apos;s points.The President had spoken about each sovereign State having one vote, but themembers of the British Empire had separate votes and he could not see thatthere was any obstacle here. The recent amendments to the Soviet constitutionhad provided that the republics should have direct representation with foreign states. The U.S.S.R. was in fact a union, and these amendments were instances of the development of democratic principles. It was unnecessary to emphasise the economic, political and military importance of the constituent republics ofthe U.S.S.R. He thought it very desirable to reach a decision on this matter at once.As regards the invitations to the conference, he agreed that these should belimited to those nations which had signed the declaration and had declared war on the common enemy. But he would like to enquire which set of Poles wouldbe present ?Mr. EDEN said that this was an additional reason for settling the Polishproblem at this conference.M. MOLOTOV said that he would like to check up the exact number of states who would be invited.Mr. STETTINIUS then read out a list of 36 States who had signed theUnited Nations declaration. He said if the United Nations could complete theirCharter they could then elect new members. In this way the new Soviet members could be elected.Mr. EDEN said that a possible procedure would be that the United nations should meet as last time, and agree at their meeting to extend their membershipto include two Soviet republics.M. MOLOTOV said that he thought it advisable that membership should begiven now to the three additional Soviet members.Mr. EDEN said that his proposal was that the members should meet and decide as part of their business that invitations should be issued to furthermembers. These additional members would then be present at the first meetingof the organisation. As he understood it, M. Molotov wished to add to this an understanding that the three Great Powers represented at this Conference should agree to recommend this course to the United Nations.M. MOLOTOV confirmed that that was what he wished.Mr. STETTINIUS said that he was favourably impressed by Mr. Eden&apos;proposal. He had not, however, discussed this aspect with the President, andtherefore he could enter into no firm commitment. He would, however, discussthe matter promptly with the President and would hope and expect to obtain afavourable answer before the end of the day.The three Foreign Ministers signified their assent to this procedure, and itwas agreed that the question of Poland should be left open, and that Mr. Edenshould report this aspect of the matter to the Prime Minister the same afternoon.Mr. STETTINUS said that there were various details &apos; regarding the invitations which should be discussed. For example, there was the question ofFrench participation, and whether China should be consulted. Also the form ofthe invitation had to be settled.Mr. EDEN suggested that a sub-committee should be set up to consider thesedetails and report.   He would nominate Mr. Jebb for this purpose.Mr. STETTINIUS nominated Mr. Hiss and M. MOLOTOV nominatedM. Gromyko.
87-2. Other Items for Discussion.Mr. EDEN said that there were a number of other items which he wouldlike to raise at forthcoming meetings, namely (1) The Yugoslav frontier with Austria and Italy.He did not wish to raise the question of what this frontier should be, but therewould be problems of administration if Austria were occupied by the Allies,and it would be desirable to fix the frontier for administrative purposes. Hewould put in a short note on the subject.  -(2) Various points in Connection with the Control Commission in Bulgaria,in the light of the recent decisions regarding the Control Commissionin Hungary.M. MOLOTOV suggested that the meeting might also consider questionswhich should be brought up at the plenary meetings. There was also the questionof when they should continue their discussions on reparations.Mr. STETTINIUS said that he would be prepared to discuss reparationsthe following day.Mr. EDEN said that he was not sure whether he would by then be in aposition to take the question further.After some discussion, it was agreed that discussion of further questions forthe plenary meetings should be postponed. M. MOLOTOV indicated that theSoviet Government would wish to raise some points.3. Persia.Mr. EDEN said that he would like to raise the question of Persia. he recalled that a declaration on Persia had been signed at Tebran. Treaties had also been made with Persia by which the Persians had granted us certainfacilities and accepted certain limitations on their freedom of action. In allother respects the Persian Government should be masters in their own house and free to take their own decisions. He felt it important to observe this limitation, since otherwise the Great Powers might find themselves involved incompetitive interference in Persian affairs. None of them wanted that. a self-denying ordinance by each of the Powers to refrain from interference in persia seemed the best way to proceed.As regards the Persian oil question, there was no dispute so far as the UnitedKingdom was concerned in regard to the Soviet need for oil. It was no part ofBritish policy to prevent Russia from obtaining oil from North Persia; indeed,Russia was the natural market for North Persian oil. He did not wish to raiseany obstacle in the way of a Russian concession if and when the Persians wereprepared to negotiate such a concession. What was wanted was that they shoulcall agree that they would not press matters further until Allied troops had beeiwithdrawn from Persia.This brought him to another question the date of withdrawal of allied troops from Persia. Mr. Eden suggested that they should consider making astatement then and there that they would be prepared to start withdrawals earlier than the final date provided for by the Treaty. He suggested that withdrawalsmight begin when the supply route through Persia had been closed down. Ifthey did come to such an agreement, this would have a good effect on the Persiansand show that the Great Powers meant to carry out the provisions of the treaties and the Tehran Declaration. 4M. MOLOTOV said that there were two questions here. The first concerned the Persian oil, and the second concerned the withdrawal of the Allied troops.The second had not been raised until that meeting. They could act only inaccordance with their treaty, and, if the treaty needed alteration, then it wouldbe necessary to study the matter.As regards Persian oil, he gave a brief summary of the history of theRussian negotiations with the Persian Government. These negotiations beganby an enquiry of the Persian Ambassador at Moscow as to,the likely attitude ofthe Persian. Government to a Soviet request for an oil concession. the ambassador answered that he was sure that the Persian Governments attitude,[29177] H 2
would be most favourable. M. Kavtaradze then went to Persia and saw thePersian Prime Minister, who seemed favourable. The Shah also favoured theidea. Indeed, this attitude seemed natural, for it would be to the advantage notonly of the U.S.S.R but also of the Persians to grant a concession, since they would gain a solid economic benefit, in accordance with the Tehran Declaration. Thiswas the first step of the negotiations. The second stage of the negotiations wasreached when the attitude in Tehran changed. The Persian Government statedthat they were unwilling to continue negotiations, and the Majlis decided thatno oil concession should be made during the war. Since then he had heard thatthis decision of the Majlis had been taken in a hurry and was not a genuine one.Why should there not be another change in the Persian attitude? If there were such a change, why should there be any objection to it ? M. Kavtaradze had nowleft Persia, and there was no fear of any pressure being brought upon the persians.In short, there were now no negotiations going on with the Persians, but theSoviet Government did not reject.the possibility of taking up negotiations again at a later date. It was all very well for the British to counsel delay, because they already had a concession. He wished to make it quite clear that the SovietGovernment had no intention whatever of disturbing the British concession in anyway. He saw no need for any special attention to be given to this matter, nor forany self-denying ordinance. Things should be allowed to go their own way, sincethe problem was not acute.Mr. STETTINIUS said that for the purpose of the record he would draw attention to the fact that the United States had not signed any wartime treaty with Persia.He would also mention that certain United States oil companies had beennegotiating at the same time as the Russians and that they also were cut short intheir negotiations.He would endorse and support Mr. Eden&apos;s statement as regards the with-drawal of troops. The only reason for the presence of United States troops wasto serve the interests of the U.S.S.R. from the standpoint of supply and movementof military material.As regards oil, he would be perfectly content that negotiations should not be resumed until after hostilities had come to an end.Mr. EDEN said that he would like to emphasise once again that there was no opposition on our part to the U.S.S.R. negotiating an oil concession with thePersian Government.Mr, STETTINIUS said that this applied also to the United States.Mr. EDEN said that we had been negotiating another concession before theRussian negotiations began, and that our negotiations had also come to an end asa result of the decision of the Majlis. If we could produce a statement on thelines he had suggested, the effect might be to reassure the Persians and makenegotiations for oil concessions easier.As regards the withdrawal of troops, no amendment of the treaties would benecessary, since provision was made for the withdrawal of troops not later than six months after all hostilities had been suspended. So far as we were concerned,there would be no difficulty in withdrawing earlier. Our suggestion was thatwithdrawals might begin as soon as supplies by the Persian route ceased. Thissuggestion was part of our desire to reassure the Persians and to help on the oilnegotiations.M. MOLOTOV said that, if it were thought desirable, he could adviseM. Kavtaradze to come to the Conference and put in a report.Mr. EDEN thought that this proposal should be considered.M. MOLOTOV said that he thought that they should in any case limit them-selves to an exchange of views.Mr. EDEN said that he would think over M. Molotov&apos;s suggestion regardingthe invitation to M. Kavtaradze and asked M. Molotov to think over what he had said.M. MOLOTOV repeated that the matter was not very urgent at present, andthat there were much more urgent questions on the list.
4. Conclusions.(1) It was decided to make the following recommendations to the plenary-meeting : (a) The United Nations Conference on the proposed World organisation should be summoned for Wednesday, the 25th April, 1945, and shouldbe held in the United States of America.(b) The United Nations, as they existed on the        February, 1945, i.e.,those who had at that date signed the United Nations Declaration,would be the only States invited to the Conference on world organisation. It would be for the Conference to determine the list oforiginal members of the Organisation. At that stage the delegates of the United Kingdom and United States would support the proposalto admit to original membership two Soviet Socialist Republics.(2) A sub-committee was established to examine further details in connexionwith the proposals for a World Organisation and to report shortly to the plenary meeting.N.B.

Report   of   Foreign   Secretaries   on   Dismemberment   of   Germany   and reparations.At the meeting on the previous day a report had been rendered by thethree Foreign Secretaries on dismemberment of Germany and reparations. ThePrime Minister had said he would like to give his final answer on these two matters on the following day when he had had time to study the report.THE PRIME MINISTER now stated that, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, he accepted the report on these two matters.2. Report by the Foreign Secretaries on World Organisation Questions.Mr. EDEN presented the following report by the Foreign Secretaries : &quot; 1.   The Foreign Secretaries met on the 8th February (a) to consider the question of membership of the World Organisationof two (or three) of the Republics of the Soviet Union;(b) to recommend what States should be invited to the proposed united nations Conference; and(c) to recommend the time and place at which that conference should beheld.2.   It was decided to make the following recommendations to thePlenary Meeting : (a) The United Nations Conference on the proposed World organisation should be summoned for Wednesday, 25th April, 1945, and shouldbe held in the United States of America;(b) The United Nations, as&apos;they existed on   -     February, 1945, i.e.,those who had at that date signed the United Nations Declaration,would be the only States invited to the conference on world organisation. It will be for the conference to determine the listof original members of the Organisation.    At that stage the
9 Q6 ydelegates of the United Kingdom and United States of Americawill support the proposal to admit to original membership twoSoviet Socialist Republics.3. The Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting has established a sub-committee toexamine further details in connection with the proposals for a world organisation and will report shortly to the Plenary Meeting.N.B. The blank represents the date of the end of theconference.&quot;In introducing the report Mr. EDEN said that the reason why it was proposed that only the Nations who had signed the United Nations declarationbefore the end of the present conference should be invited to the proposed conference was that it was felt that it would not be right that nations should begiven an opportunity of signing that declaration merely in order to secure an invitation to the conference on World Organisation questions.He also explained that it was proposed that the three Foreign Secretariesshould hold a meeting in London before the date of the proposed World Organisa-tion Conference. It was proposed that this meeting should be held in London, andhe understood that this suggestion was regarded as acceptable.MARSHAL STALIN said that he had a list of the States which had declared war on Germany. These States would become members of the world organisation. Among them there were included ten who were not in diplomatic relations with the Soviet Government. It seemed strange that Russia shouldbe partners in a World Organisation whose object was to iittain internationalsecurity, with nations with whom they were not in diplomatic relations. perhaps the Conference could discuss the matter and find a way out.THE PRESIDENT thought that there were probably special reasons whythese particular States were not in diplomatic relations with Russia. Forexample, in some States there was a strong Catholic influence. He pointed out,however, that representatives of all these States had been associated with Russiaat a number of recent conferences, such as Bretton Woods and Hot Springs,and he thought that the end Marshal Stalin had in view would be facilitated byinviting all the States in question to the proposed Conference.The President then explained that he himself was faced with a certaindifficulty in this matter. Some years ago, the Acting Secretary of State,Mr. Sumner Welles, had told the Republics of South America that, while it wasnecessary that they should break off diplomatic relations with Germany, it wasnot necessary for them to declare war. Five or six States had acted on this advice, and felt that they were in good standing, and would regard themselves as entitled to be invited to the proposed Conference. The present Secretaryof State (Mr. Stettinius) had brought this matter to his notice about a month ago.As a result, he had sent a letter to the Presidents of these six Republics, explaining that if they wished to be invited to the Conference of the United Nations, thevwould have to declare war on Germany. One of these States, Ecuador, had declared war, but had not yet had an opportunity to sign the declaration.Paraguay would declare war in a short time, say, a week or ten days. Peru,Venezuela and Uruguay would probably declare war soon. It would be ratherembarrassing if, after this action had been taken, these States were neverthelessnot to receive an invitation. He regarded the action taken by Mr. Sumner Wellesas having been mistaken, but the nations in question had all given help in thewar, and a considerable proportion of the raw materials for munitions had comefrom these countries, which were among the &quot; Associated Nations.&quot;M. MOLOTOV asked what was the position of the Argentine.THE PRESIDENT said that the Argentine did not come into this matter atall and was not one of the &quot; Associated Nations.&quot;M. MOLOTOV pointed out that they had nevertheless broken off relationswith Germany.MARSHAL STALIN said that he held no brief for the Argentine. At thesame time, would there not be some logical contradiction if a number of states which had broken off relations with Germany but had not declared war weremvited to attend the Conference while others in the same position, for example, theArgentine and Turkey, did not receive invitations.   Furthermore, if invitations
were to be issued to countries which declared war against Germany at this latedate, would this not mean that invitations would be issued to a number of nations who had wavered, and looked to their own interests, and had only declared war when they saw who was going to win?THE PRESIDENT said that his suggestion was to invite to the Conferencethose members of the &apos;&apos; Associated Nations &apos;&apos; who were prepared to declare war against Germany immediately.MARSHAL STALIN said that this would be satisfactory, provided thatthey declared war before the 1st March.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he supported the suggestion that onlynations which declared war should be invited to the Conference. He agreed with marshal Stalin that this would mean issuing invitations to a certain number ofnations which had not played a very good part in the war, and had watched until they saw which side was going to win. On the other hand, we were recruitingnations to a world organisation to oppose Germany, and it would have a depressing effect on Germany if another batch of nations were now to declare warupon them. This might also have an effect on other hostile belligerents, whenthey saw the whole world going against them.THE PRESIDENT said that to avoid uncertainty, he would like to make itclear that the &quot;Associated Nations&quot; included Iceland the newest republic inthe world.THE PRIME MINISTER referrred to the position of Egypt. ^ On two occasions. Egypt had wanted to declare war against Germany and Italy, but wehad advised her against this course, as we had thought, by doing so, we wouldspare Cairo and the rest of Egypt from heavy air bombardment, and that it wouldbe more to our interest that Egypt should be nominally neutral. Again, when theenemy had advanced to within 30 or 40 miles of her capital, Egyptian forces had done vahiable service on internal security. He therefore felt a special responsi-bility for Egypt and thought that she should be given the chance of declaring war now.Iceland had also rendered us valuable services before the United States had come into the war.   She had admitted the United States and British troopsthereby violating her neutrality and securing our life-line across the Atlantic.Iceland should also be given an opportunity of getting an invitation if shedeclared war.MARSHAL STALIN said that he hoped it was clear, but that invitationswould not be issued to the nations which had fought against us and changed sides,such as Italy and Hungary.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, and said that Eire should not be invitedeither.THE PRESIDENT, agreed that such nations should not be admitted. Inaddition to those who were now the United Nations, it was only proposed to giveinvitations to those of the &quot; Associated Nations &quot; who declared war by the1st March.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to Turkey, which had made an alliance with us before the war at a dangerous time. When the war&apos;had broken out Turkeyhad found that her army was not equipped with the weapons required for modernwarfare. Her attitude had, however, remained friendly and helpful in manyways, although she had not taken the chance offered her a year ago. It was forconsideration whether, if Turkey was now ready to make a death-bed repentanceand declare war, she should not receive an invitation.MARSHAL STALIN agreed that she should.THE PRESIDENT referred to the case of Denmark, which had beeninvaded in a night. Her King had been made a prisoner and her Government hadbeen under German domination ever since. The Danish Minister in Washingtonclaimed to represent Denmark and had disowned the action of the Danish Govern-ment.  But he could hardly declare war.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not regard the matter as ofimportance. He thought that Denmark could wait until she could speak forherself, and, as soon as she could, she would have the right to enter the world organisation.
MARSHAL STALIN agreed that Denmark could wait.M. MOLOTOV referred to the two Soviet Socialist Republics the admissionof which to original membership in the World Organisation the United Kingdomand United States had agreed to support. Would not their position be improvedif they could sign the United Nations declaration before the 1st March ? If theyhad not signed the declaration by the 1st March, might not this fact be used as an objection to admitting them to original membership?THE PRESIDENT said that it had been agreed that the United States andthe United Kingdom would support the claims of these two republics to originalmembership of the Assembly at the forthcoming conference. He thought,however, that there was some technical difficulty in including these two Republicsamong the States invited to attend the United Nations conference on the proposedWorld Organisation. Hitherto, at the present meeting they had been discussing the issue of invitations to existing States which had not been admitted to the ranks of the United Nations. In the case of the two Soviet Republics, however,what was in question was a different matter, namely, that the Union of soviet socialist Republics should in future have three votes instead of one vote.MARSHAL STALIN said that he would be content if the two Republicscould be mentioned by name in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Secretaries&apos; report.This proposal was accepted.The conclusion of the CONFERENCE was as follows :-The report by the Foreign Secretaries was accepted, subject to paragraph 2 (b) being amended to read as follows: &quot; The united nations as they exist on the 8th February, 1945, and such of the associated Nations* as have declared war on the common enemy bythe 1st March, 1945, would be the only States invited to the Conferenceon World Organisation. At that stage the delegates of the UnitedKingdom and United States of America will support the proposal to^ admit to original membership two Soviet Socialist Republics, i.e., theUkraine and White Russia.&quot;* The term &quot;Associated Nation&quot; in this connection means the eight Associated nations and Turkey, which shall be regarded as an Associated Nation for that purpose.3. Poland.At the meeting on the previous day M. Molotov had read to the conferencecertain proposals.THE PRESIDENT said that he had prepared a revised draft of theseproposals and he asked if M. Molotov had received a copy.. M. MOLOTOV said that he had done so.THE PRESIDENT then read out his revised proposals which were asfollows : &quot; The proposals submitted by M. Molotov in regard to the polish question in reply to the Presidents letter to Marshal Stalin dated the6th February, 1945, have been given careful study.In regard to the frontier question, no objection is perceived to point Oneof the Soviet proposals, namely, that the eastern boundary of Poland shouldbe the Curzon Line with modifications in favour of Poland in some areas offrom five to eight kilometres.In regard to point Two, while agreeing that compensation should begiven to Poland at the expense of Germany, including that portion of east prussia south of the Koenigsberg line, Upper Silesia, and up to the line ofthe Oder, there would appear to be little justification for the extension ofthe western boundary of Poland up to the western Neisse River.In regard to the proposals of the Soviet Government concerning thefuture Government of Poland, it is proposed that M. Molotov, Mr. Harrimanand Sir Archibald Clark Kerr be authorised on behalf of the three Govern-ments to invite to Moscow M. Beirut, M, Osubka-Morawski, Bishop Sapieha,M. Vicente Witos, M. Mikolajczyk and M. Grabski to form a PolishGovernment of National Unity along the following lines : 1. There will be formed a Presidential Committee of three, possiblyconsisting of M. Beirut, M. Grabski and Bishop Sapieha, torepresent the Presidential Office of the Polish Republic.[29177] i
2. This Presidential Committee will undertake the formation of aGovernment consisting of representative leaders from the presentPolish Provisional Government in Warsaw; from other demo-cratic elements inside Poland, and from Polish democratic leadersabroad.3. This interim Government, when formed, will pledge itself to the holding of free elections in Poland as soon as conditions permitfor a Constituent Assembly to establish a new Polish Constitutionunder which a permanent Government would be elected.4. When a Polish Government of National unity is formed, the three governments will then proceed, to accord it recognition as theProvisional Government of Poland.&quot;THE PRESIDENT said that as regards frontiers, he saw little justification for a line as far West as the Western Neisse. He was not familiar with the territories involved, but he knew what difficulties were involved in large transfers of population.As to the Government of Poland, his proposals were very similar to thoseof M. Molotov, but were framed in such a way as to carry with them recognition by the Governments of all three Great Powers of the Polish Government ofNational Unity which it was proposed to set up.M. MOLOTOV asked whether, when the Polish Government of national unity had been formed, the Polish Government in London would cease to berecognised.THE PRIME MINISTER and THE PRESIDENT agreed that this wouldbe so.MARSHAL STALIN pointed out that this was not so stated.THE; PRIME MINISTER said that if and when a stage was reached when we could recognise the Polish Government of National Unity, it would follow that we should withdraw recognition from the London Government of poland and accredit an Ambassador to the new Government.M. MOLOTOV asked what the position would be as regards the money and resources in the possession of the London Polish Government. Would theypass to the new Government?THE PRIME MINISTER said that in principle this was so, but he didnot know what legal and technical points might be involved.THE PRESIDENT said that all property of the Polish Government outsidePoland would pass automatically to the new Government.[At this point the Conference adjourned for a short interval.]THE PRIME MINISTER said that the British Delegation had preparedan alternative document which they had submitted to their Soviet friends (see annex). But as the discussion had begun on the Presidents document, theywould not refer to their draft until agreement had been reached in principle, atwhich point they might have some verbal amendments which they would like tohave considered.M. MOLOTOV said that he wanted to make a few observations on the presidents memorandum and on what the Prime Minister had said on theprevious day. The Soviet proposals were based on certain definite foundations.They thought it would be useful to discuss the Polish Government on the basis that the present Provisional Government in Lublin should be extended and that new members should join it. They could not ignore that the Provisional Govern-ment existed and was now in Warsaw. This Government was now at the headof the Polish people and enjoyed great authority and prestige and had beenenthusiastically acclaimed by the majority of the Polish people. If new pro-posals were now put forward which ignored this, fact, it might create a situationin which the Poles themselves would be unable to agree to what was suggested.But if they were to start from the basis that this Government should be enlarged,he thought that success would be achieved. Those who now formed the ProvisionalGovernment were closely connected with the great national events which had
taken place and were still taking nlace in Poland. The same could not be said about people like MM. Mikolajczyk, Grabski, Witos and Romer. These peoples&apos;names were not linked with the decisive events which were taking place in Poland,in which they had taken no direct part. If they wanted to come to practical con-clusions, it was therefore necessary to take as their starting-point the fact thatthe present Government should be enlarged by a certain number of people. how many people, and who they should be, was another question which would have tobe discussed. It would be a difficult question, and would depend in the first placeon the Poles who were now working in liberated Poland.The President had made another proposal, namely, that they should agreeabout the composition of a Presidential Committee as well as about the composition of the Government.M. Molotov said that he had doubts about this. He feared that, instead ofone problem they would have two, namely the composition of the PresidentialCommittee as well as of the Government, and that this would increase rather thandiminish their difficulties.There was a National Council which was the legislative council of Poland.This body could be enlarged and they might well discuss at this conference how this should be done. He thought it was better to talk on the basis of the existing situation and to consider how it could be met. His conclusion, therefore, was thatthey should consider how and by what people the National Council, which nowexisted in Poland, and the Provisional Government could be enlarged. Both werepurely interim institutions, and all the proposals that were being made had oneobject in view, namely, to secure for Poland free elections as soon as possible. Thatwould be the best way to build up that stable order in Poland which all agreedwas necessary.M. Molotov said that as regards the eastern frontier of Poland there wasagreement. As regards the western frontier, however, there was no unanimity.He knew that the Lublin Poles were definitely in favour of the frontier proposedby the Soviet Delegation. They could, of course, ask the Poles what they thought,but he knew well what the answer would be.As regards the discussions in Moscow, Mr. Harriman, Sir A. Clark Kerr and himself would have talks with the Poles, and&apos; it was very desirable that full agreement should be reached. It had been his experience that the ProvisionalGovernment usually selected three persons for talks of this kind, namely,MM. Beirut and Osobka Morawski and General Rola-Zymierski. As regards the others, the proposal of the President in his letter of the previous day would bemore acceptable. The possibility could not be excluded that the ProvisionalGovernment would refuse to talk at all with some people, for instance withM. Mikolajczyk, with whom relations had greatly deteriorated since the conver-sations of last autumn. The Presidents proposal of the previous day that twoout of the five people whose names were mentioned in his letter should be invitedwould be accepted. If three people came from the Provisional Government andtwo out of the five whose names were mentioned in the Presidents letter, nego-tiations could be started. This was the proposal which M. Molotov thought was most practical and useful in the circumstances.THE PRESIDENT asked whether M. Molotov agreed to the proposal aboutthe Presidential Committee.M. MOLOTOV replied that it was better to avoid the Presidential Com-mittee, and to concentrate on enlarging the National Council and the ProvisionalGovernment. He thought that Mr. Harriman, Sir A. Clark Kerr and himselfcould discuss the question of how to enlarge these bodies, and what people shouldbe added to them with the three members of the Provisional Government andtwo of the people mentioned in the Presidents letter. The proposals which were adopted by the three of them would then be submitted to their three Governments.M. Molotov added that he had based his remarks entirely on the United states proposals and had not said anything about those which had been put forward by the Prime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would not put forward any detailedsuggestions until the principles had been agreed. They were at the crucial pointof-this conference. This was a question for the settlement of which the whole world was waiting. If they separated still recognising different Polish Govern-ments, it would be accepted all over the world that fundamental differences still[29177] j 2
existed between Russia and their British and American allies and the conse-quences would be most lamentable. It would stamp this conference with theseal of failure. On the other hand, of course, they took different views aboutthe basic facts in Poland, or at any rate some of them. According to the informa-tion of His Majesty&apos;s Government the new Lublin (now Warsaw) government did not commend itself to the great majority of the Polish people, and theycould not feel that it would be accepted abroad as representing them. If theconference were to brush aside the existing London Government and lend all its weight to the Lublin Government, there would be a world outcry. As far as could be foreseen the Poles outside of Poland would make a virtually unitedprotest. There was under British command a Polish army of 150,000 mengathered from among all those who had been able to come together from outsidePoland.  This army had fought, and was still fighting, very bravely.THE PRIME MINISTER did not believe, that this army would be at allreconciled to the Lublin Government, and it would regard Great Britain&apos;s actionin transferring recognition from the Government which they had recognised sincethe beginning of the war as a betrayal of that Government. As Marshal Stalinand M. Molotov well knew, he himself did not agree with the London Govern-ments action, which had been foolish at every stage. But the formal act of transferring recognition from those whom they had hitherto recognised to this new Government would cause the gravest criticism. It would be said that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had given way completely on the Eastern frontier (asthey in fact had) and had accepted and championed the Soviet view. It wouldalso be said that they had broken altogether with the lawful Government ofPoland, which they had recognised for these five years of war; and that they hadno knowledge of what was actually proceeding in Poland. They could not enter the country. They could not see and hear what opinion was. It would be saidthat they could only accept what the Lublin Government proclaimed about theopinion of the Polish people, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would be chargedin Parliament with having forsaken altogether the cause of Poland. The debateswhich would follow would be most painful and embarrassing to the unity of theAllies, even supposing that they were able to agree to the proposals of his friendM. Molotov.The Prime Minister did not think that these proposals went nearly far enough. If they gave up the Polish Government in London, a new start shouldbe made from both sides on more or less equal terms. Before His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could abandon their present position of continuing to recognise theLondon Government and transfer their recognition to another Government, theywould have to be satisfied that the new Government was truly representative ofthe Polish nation. He agreed that this could only be one point of view, as HisMajesty&apos;s Government did not fully know the facts, and all their differenceswould, of course, be removed if a free and unfettered general election were heldin Poland by ballot and with universal suffrage and free candidatures. Oncesuch an election had been held, His Majesty&apos;s Government would salute theGovernment that emerged without regard to the Polish Government in London.It was the interval before that election that was causing them so much anxiety.M. MOLOTOV said that perhaps the talks in Moscow would have some usefulresult. It was very difficult to deal with this question without the participation of the Poles themselves, who would have to have their say.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, but said that it was so important thatthe present conference should separate on a note of agreement that they mustall struggle patiently to achieve it.THE PRESIDENT said that, as inhabitants of another hemisphere, it wasthe great objective of the Americans that there should be an early generalelection in Poland. The only problem was how the country was to be governedbetween now and then, and he hoped it would be possible to hold elections beforethe end of the present year.   The problem was, therefore, limited in time.MARSHAL STALIN said that the Prime Minister had complained abouthaving no real information and no means whereby he could receive it.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had got certain information.MARSHAL STALIN replied that that information did not agree with his.Great Britain and the United States could have their own informants in Poland
whenever they chose. He asked what was the basis from which sprang thepopularity of the Provisional Government, and he could assure the conference that they really were very popular, particularly Beirut, Osobka-Morawski andZymierski. These were people who had not left the country during the german occupation. They had lived all the time in Warsaw and they came from the underground movement. That made a deep impression on the Polish people, andthe peculiar mentality of people who had lived under the occupation should beborne in mind. They sympathised with all those who had not left the country indifficult circumstances, and they considered the three people he had named asbeing people of that kind. Marshal Stalin did not Believe that they were geniuses.The London Government might well contain cleverer people, but they were notliked in Poland because they had not been seen there at the time when thepopulation was suffering under the Hitlerite occupation. That feeling wasprimitive perhaps, but it certainly did exist.It was a great event in Poland that the country had been liberated by soviet troops and this had changed everything. It was well known that the Poles didnot like the Russians, because they had three times participated in the partition of Poland. But the advance of the Soviet troops and the liberation of Polandfrom Hitlerite occupation had completely changed their mood. The old resent-ment had disappeared and its place had been taken now by goodwill and evenenthusiasm towards the Russians. That was perfectly natural. The populationhad been delighted to see the Germans flee and to feel that they were liberated.Marshal Stalin&apos;s impression was that the Polish population considered thedriving out of the Germans a great patriotic holiday in Polish life, and theywere astounded that the London Government did not take any part in this greatfestival of the Polish nation. They saw on the streets the members of theProvisional Government, but asked where were the London Poles. This under-mined the prestige of the London Government and these two circumstances were responsible for the fact that members of the Provisional Government, though not great men, enjoyed great popularity.Marshal Stalin thought that these facts could not be ignored if they wanted to take account of the feelings of the Polish people. The Prime minister had said that he feared the conference separating before agreement was reached.What therefore was to be done ? The various Governments had different informa-tion, and drew different conclusions from it. Perhaps, therefore, the first thingwas to call together the Poles from the different camps and hear what they hadto say.There was dissatisfaction with the fact that the Polish Government was notelected. It would naturally be better to have a Government based on free elections, but the war had so far prevented that. The day was, however, nearwhen elections could be held; but until then they must deal with the ProvisionalGovernment as they had dealt, for instance, with General de Gaulle&apos;s Govern-ment in France which also was not elected. He did not know himself whetherBeirut or General de Gaulle enjoyed greater authority, but it had been possibleto make a treaty with General de Gaulle and therefore why should it not bepossible to do so with an enlarged Polish Government which would be no lessdemocratic than the Government of General de Gaulle. It was not reasonable to demand more from Poland than from France. Up to the present time theFrench Government had carried out no reform which created enthusiasm inFrance, whereas the Polish Government had enacted a land reform which hadaroused great enthusiasm. If they approached the matter without prejudice theywould be able to find a common basis. The situation was not as tragic as thePrime Minister thought, and the question could be settled if too much importance was not attached to secondary matters and if they concentrated on essentials.He entirely agreed with M. Molotov in thinking that it was better to dealwith the reconstruction of the present Provisional Government than to dreate anew one. As regards the Presidential Committee, they could certainly talk tothe Poles and it was possible that they might agree. He must, however, say that,as a result of their previous deliberations on Poland, the amour propre and confidence of the Provisional Government had greatly increased. If they hadnot been listened to, they would probably have said that the Russians wereinvaders.THE PRESIDENT asked how soon it would be possible to hold elections.MARSHAL STALIN thought it should be possible to hold them withina month unless there was some catastrophe on the front, which he thought wasimprobable.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that a free election would, of course, setHis Majesty&apos;s Governments mind at rest. They would feel that they could whole-heartedly support a Government elected in this way which would supersedeeverything else. But they must not ask for anything which would in any wayhamper the military operations which were the supreme end. (Marshal Stalinindicated his approval.) If, however, it were possible to ascertain the will ofthe Polish people in so short a time, or even within two months, it would create an entirely different situation for His Majesty&apos;s Government and no one would oppose it.THE PRESIDENT said that it was for that reason that he thought thesubject was worth pursuing. He suggested that the Foreign Secretaries shouldtalk the matter over together with Sir A. Clark Kerr and Mr. Harriman.This suggestion was agreed to. -4. Foreign Secretaries&apos; Conference.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought it would be a great advantage and would be generally applauded, if permanent machinery were setup for consultation between the three Foreign Secretaries. He suggested thatthey should meet every three or four months, in the three capitals in rotation.MARSHAL STALIN said that that would be a very good thing.THE PRESIDENT said that his Foreign Secretary had also to look afterSouth America. While he agreed that they should meet as often as necessary,say, about every three or four months, he would prefer that no definite datesshould be fixed.THE PRIME MINISTER said that as all important meetings so far hadbeen held in the United States or the. Soviet Union, he would like to suggestthat the,first Foreign Secretaries&apos; Conference should be held in London.This was agreed to.5. Yugoslavia.MARSHAL STALIN asked why the formation of the new Government in yugoslavia had been delayed.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the King had been persuaded, and indeed almost forced, to sign a decree appointing Regents, and that the membersof Marshal Tito&apos;s Government who were in London were leaving for Yugoslaviato-day. The new Government would be formed immediately. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had two small amendments which they thought would improve theagreement between Marshal Tito and M. Subasic, and if Marshal Stalin approvedhe thought that a kindly word from him would secure complete agreement.Perhaps M. Molotov and Mr. Eden might discuss the matter. The Prime Minister-added that, from the moment the King had made difficulties about the agreement,he had made it clear publicly that he would be by-passed if he withheld his assent.MARSHAL STALIN observed that Tito was now also popular and that ifanybody gave him advice he sometimes kicked.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that Marshal Stalin might take therisk.6. Greece.M. STALIN said that he had heard many rumours about Greece. He hadno intention of criticising, but would like to know what was happening.THE PRIME MINISTER hoped that peace would come soon on the basisof an amnesty except for acts contrary to the laws- of war. He doubted whethera Government could be formed which contained all parties, because they hatedeach other so much that they could hardly keep their hands off their opponents.MARSHAL STALIN suggested that perhaps they had not yet got used todiscussions.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would much like to inform marshal stalin about the situation.  He had asked Sir W. Citrine and five other Trade
Unionists to go to Greece. They had made a report which he had not yet seenhimself, but he would try to get a copy. The British had had rather a roughtime, and he was much obliged to Marshal Stalin for his attitude to this matter.MARSHAL STALIN repeated that all he wanted was information and thathe did not wish to interfere.The meeting then adjourned.. ANNEX.British Revised Formula for Poland1. It was agreed that the Curzon Line should be the eastern frontier ofPoland with adjustments in some regions of 5 to 8 kilometres in favour of Poland.2. It was decided that the territory of Poland in the west should includethe free city of Danzig, the regions of East Prussia west and south of Konigsberg,the administrative district of Oppeln in Silesia and the lands desired by poland to the east of the line of the Oder. It was understood that the Germans in thesaid regions should be repatriated to Germany and that all Poles in germany should at their wish be repatriated to Poland.3. Having regard to the recent liberation of western Poland by the Sovietarmies it was deemed desirable to facilitate the establishment of a fully rep re-sen tative Provisional Polish Government based upon all the democratic and anti-Fascist forces in Poland and including democratic leaders from Poles abroad.That Government should be so constituted as to command recognition by the threeAllied Governments.4. It was agreed that the establishment of such a Provisional Governmentwas the primary responsibility of the Polish people, and that, pending thepossibility of free elections, representative Polish leaders should consult together on the composition of this Provisional Government. M. Molotov, Mr. -Harrimanand Sir Archibald Clark Kerr were entrusted with the task of approaching suchleaders and submitting their proposals to the consideration of the three AlliedGovernments.5. It was deemed desirable that the Provisional Polish Government, thusestablished, should as soon as possible hold free and unfettered elections on thebasis of universal suffrage and secret ballot, in which all democratic parties shouldhave the right to participate and to promote candidatures, in order to ensure theestablishment of a Government truly representative of the will of the Polishpeople.
F.S.M. (Argonaut) 7th Meeting.9th February, 1945.RECORD OF A MEETING HELD AT LIVADIA AT 12 noon on 9th FEBRUARY, 1945,present mr. Eden.Sir A. Cadogan.Sir A. Clark Kerr.Mr. Jebb (Item 4).Mr. Dixon.Mr. Roberts (Item 2).Mr Harrison (Item 3).Mr. W..D. Allen (Item 2).Mr. R. Allen.Major Theakstone (Interpreter).M. Molotov.M. Vyshinski.M. Maisky.M. Gromyko.M. Gousev.M. Golunski (Interpreter).Mr. Stettinitjs.Mr. Harriman.Mr. Matthews.Mr. Bohlen.Mr. Page (Interpreter).1. Items for Discussion.Mr, STETTINIUS said that he would first make a general review of the items which had been referred to the Foreign Secretaries. These were asfollows : (1) The questions regarding the World Organisation which had. been referred to them by the Plenary Meeting of the previous day.(2) The report of the Sub-Committee set up at their own meeting on theform of the invitation to the World Organisation Conference and on thedetails of the arrangements for the Conference.(3) Reparation.(4) The Polish question.(5) The Persian question..(6) Possibly certain other matters.M. MOLOTOV said that he would also like to raise the question of yugoslavia with reference to the carrying-out of the Tito-Subasic agreement. he also hoped that they might find time at that meeting to discuss reparations.Mr. EDEN said that he was not yet ready for this.Mr. STETTINIUS said that, nevertheless, his colleagues might be interested to have the American comments on.the Russian plan.Mr. EDEN and M. MOLOTOV agreed.2. Poland.It was decided that the meeting should deal first with Poland.Mr. STETTINIUS said that there was one important point which he hadnot previously mentioned. The United States Government would have a hardfight ahead of them on the question of United States participation in the world organisation. In this connection the Polish issue was very important from the standpoint of psychology and public relations. He hoped very much that theywould be able to settle this question before they broke up.He then read a statement setting out the United States Delegation^ views(see Annex I).M. MOLOTOV said that he would like to see the text in Russian.After a short discussion it was agreed that the text should be translated into Russian forthwith and considered later in the meeting.
Meanwhile Mr. EDEN said that he had some preliminary remarks to make on Mr. Stettinius&apos;s proposal. He must tell his colleagues frankly of his difficultiesin this matter. Many people thought that the Poles had been harshly treated by our readiness to acquiesce in a frontier on the Curzon Line. He himself hadbeen troubled for some time because, quite apart from the merits of the case,it might become a cause of difficulty between the Soviet Government and ourselves.As regards the Lublin Provisional Government, it was possible that we were quite wrong, but he thought it was a fact that hardly anyone in&apos; our countrybelieved that the Lublin Government was representative of Poland. He shouldhave thought that that view was widely held in the rest of Europe and in theUnited States of America. It was for that reason that the document which wehad put forward the previous day had avoided all mention of adding to the lublin government and had stressed that a new. start was necessary.If agreement were reached here, this would involve a transfer of recognitionfrom the London Government to the new Government, We should have toabandon recognition of the London Government, and such abandonment wouldbe much easier for us if it were not made in favour of the existing lublin government but in favour of a new Government.We had considerable Polish forces fighting with us -about 150,000 atpresent and these forces would increase as more Poles were liberated or escapedfrom Switzerland. We naturally desired very much to carry them with us in any settlement.   Our task would be easier if a fresh start were made.He had one other comment which concerned a personality. It had been saidthat there was considerable opposition to M. Mikolajczyk in the Lublin Govern-ment. He was not convinced of that. But in any case, the presence ofMr. Mikolajczyk in a Polish Government would do more than anything else to add to the authority of that Government and to convince the British people of itsrepresentative character.M. MOLOTOV said that he could not attempt to better Marshal Stalin&apos;sexposition of the Russian case on the previous day. However, he would state theRussian thesis once again. The President had quite correctly noted that theywere dealing with a provisional situation which could not last. The principalrequisite was that as soon as possible there should be general elections in Poland.Those elections would give a basis for the further government of Poland, andwould solve the difficulties at present before us. The question of elections wasfundamental. They would provide the answer to criticisms that too many con-cessions had been made. The period before the elections should be short: marshal stalin had mentioned one month, the Prime Minister two months.One must remember that fighting was still going on in Poland and that poland was the rear area of the Red Army. For the short period before theelections could take place, the United States and British Governments must takethe military situation into account. It was essential to have a firm base for theRed Army. The Soviet Government therefore suggested a reorganisation of thepresent Polish Government by the addition of Poles from within&apos;and without.He might be wrong when he said that he thought M. Mikolajczyk was unacceptable to the Poles, but, in any event, they did not decide this matter there.It was for the Poles to do so. They should therefore have a talk with the Polesof both parties. The question of M. Mikolajczyk&apos;s position might prove to benot so acute. He thought that the Commission of Ambassadors referred to in theAmerican proposals should undertake the task of talking to the Poles. It wouldbe a serious task to achieve a settlement in Poland, but he saw an attempt in theUnited States formula to deal with this task.Mr. STETTINIUS said that he regarded M. Molotov&apos;s remarks asinteresting and helpful. *Mr. EDEN said he would make one point in connexion with M. Molotov&apos;remarks on the importance of holding elections. He agreed that this was important. But opinion at home would not regard elections managed by theLublin Government as free elections. That was why he kept on talking about thenecessity of having a new Government.M. MOLOTOV asked whether we must then postpone the elections until thenew Government had been formed.Mr. EDEN said that was his opinion.,    The meeting then discussed other matters and later returned to Poland whentne American proposals had been translated into Russian.[29177] K
M. MOLOTOV then said that he had read these proposals, but he could onlygive a preliminary answer. As regards the first sentence of the formula put upfor consideration, he thought that we should not insist on things which couldnot be settled without consultation with the Poles. We ought rather to say something on the lines that a new Government was being created on the basis ofthe present by adding democratic forces from within and from abroad. If theprinciple were accepted, we could always find a formula.He thought we should also leave out the last three lines of the last sentence of the proposal, since this might appear offensive to the Poles.Mr. EDEN said that he would read out his amendments to the Americanformula for what they were worth.  (See Annex&quot;II.)Mr. STETTINIUS said that he liked Mr. Eden&apos;s formula.M. MOLOTOV said that he thought they could not leave out all mention that the new Government should be formed on the basis of the present Govern-ment, otherwise they would get an unstable situation in the rear of the Red Army.Mr. STETTINIUS pointed out that the difference between them lay in theRussian desire to base the new Government on the existing Government. It wouldbe impossible for them to reach agreement unless they could get away from thenecessity for talking about the existing Government in their formula. Would notM. Molotov be prepared to consider a formula which provided for basing the new government on the existing and on new leaders ?M. MOLOTOV said that it was a difficult matter to deal with the Poles.The Soviet Government could not allow a situation to arise where there was no government at all in Poland. Mr. Eden&apos;s formula would leave everythingundecided.Mr. STETTTNIUS said that the existing Government would continue until a new Government were formed.M. MOLOTOV said that the Poles would know that negotiations were going on. They would know that the existing Government could not last long. Thiswould weaken the Government and protract negotiations. It would be an impossible situation for the Red Army.Mr. STETTINIUS suggested that Mr. Eden;s formula got round this.M. MOLOTOV said that Mr. Eden&apos;s formula was incompatible with theRussian proposal to reorganise the Government on the basis of the present government, and that it would lead to endless and fruitless negotiations, andwould create a negative attitude of which the Poles could take advantage. Hewould like to discuss the matter with the Poles in Moscow.It was suggested that the meeting would have to report to the plenary meeting that they had been unable to reach agreement.3. Reparation.Whilst the meeting was awaiting the translation of the American memo-randum on Poland, it was decided to continue the discussion on reparation.Mr. STETTINIUS put in a document (Annex III) containing the Americancomments on the Russian memorandum on the basic principles of exaction of reparation from Germany of 7th February.M. MAISKY said that the first part of this would be acceptable. As regardsthe third paragraph he was not quite clear about the significance of the last sentence. He thought that the Commission should consider the figure of 20 billiondollars as a basis. This would mean that the final figures should be arrived at by starting from this figure       basis for discussion.Mr. STETTINIUS suggested that the figure of 20 billion dollars should betaken into consideration and studied by the Commission.M. MOLOTOV asked how this figure raised doubts. Was it consideredtoo small or too large ?Mr. STETTINIUS said that this could not be known until the commission had studied the situation. But the United States Government would be preparedto accept it as a basis for discussion.M. MAISKY said that that was what was wanted.
Mr. EDEN said that he had not yet received an answer from London tohis request for the views of the War Cabinet. But he could say that the PrimeMinister had told him that nothing would induce him to agree to the insertionat this stage of any figure. It was quite impossible at present to know whatthe figure should be.M. MOLOTOV recalled that a figure had also been mentioned for the share of the U.S.S.R. (10 billion dollars) : could not mention of this be inserted in the document?Mr. STETTINIUS said that while he felt that the whole question should goto the Reparation Commission, and he had been favourably impressed byM. Maisky&apos;s exposition of two days ago, he could not commit the United StatesGovernment at this stage beyond agreeing that the share of the U.S.S.R. shouldbe 50 per cent, of the total sum received.M. MOLOTOV said that he had no objection, although it might be that theRussian share would turn out to be rather more or rather less. But the mention of a figure would have great importance for the Russians.Mr. STETTINIUS said that he did not think that he could go further thaninserting a reference to the 20 billion dollars as a basis for discussion and to theU.S.S.R.&apos;s share as being 50 per cent, of the total received.Mr. EDEN said that he was quite sure that the Prime Minister would not agree to the insertion of any figures as yet. His Russian friends could restassured that the British understood the extent to which they had suffered and thatthey would not be niggardly, but they wanted the Commission to do its work without being told its business by them.M. MAISKY said that it would, however, be necessary to give theCommission lines to work on.Mr. STETTINIUS enquired what price level should be fixed in assessing the reparation, and M. MAISKY agreed that the 1938 level should be fixed with perhaps an increase of 10 or 15 per cent, as had been done in the case of hungary and Roumania.Mr. EDEN enquired whether the policy of dismemberment might not reducethe total which they could get out of Germany, but M. MAISKY thought thisunlikely, at any rate as regards the lump sum payment. As regards the annual payments, there might be variations from the figure he had named during thefirst years, owing to dismemberment, but these could be adjusted. Since theywere only proposing to take 5 or 6 per cent, of the total income of Germany,dismemberment should not make this impossible.Mr. STETTINIUS suggested that the meeting should report to the plenary meeting that the United States and Soviet Delegations had reached agreement on a statement of principles, namely a reference to the figure of 20 billion dollarsas a basis for consideration, and to the share of the U.S.S.R. being 50 per cent,of the total sum received. It should be reported that Mr. Eden reserved theBritish position.4. United Nations Conference: Consultation with China and France.Mr. STETTINIUS said that he understood that it had already beenagreed that the United States should consult China and France before the invitation to the Conference was issued.Mr. EDEN and M. MOLOTOV signified their assent.Braft Invitation to United Nations Conference.Mr. STETTINIUS asked that the meeting should give the sub-committeewhich they had set up authority to proceed with the work of drafting the invitation.  He put in a draft form of invitation (see Annex IV).Mr. EDEN said that it might save time if he said at once that he did not like the passage in square brackets.[29177]        &apos; K 2
Mr. STETTINIUS said that on the question of territorial trusteeship, he did not contemplate that there should be a detailed discussion at the conference with reference to any particular territory. He merely urged that they should agree to establish the right of the Organisation to deal with this question if itarose.After some discussion it was agreed that the passage in square bracketsshould be omitted from the form of invitation, but that the meeting should report to the Plenary Meeting that it was the intention of the governments represented at the Conference to take up this question on the diplomatic levelbefore the meeting of the United Nations.5. Persia.Mr. STETTINIUS said that the statement which Mr. Eden had put inregarding Persia (see Annex V) was acceptable to the United States Government.M. MOLOTOV said that he had not yet had an opportunity of looking atit but would discuss it later.6. Yugoslavia.M, MOLOTOV then raised the question of Yugoslavia (on which Mr. Edenhad handed him a paper Annex VI the previous evening). He said thatthere was at present an indefinite and unstable situation there. On the1st November an agreement had been concluded between Tito and Subasic, afterconsiderable negotiations. On the 11th January the Prime Minister had informedMarshal Stalin that in his view this agreement should be put into effect, andhe had later repeated this view. Yesterday the Soviet Government had beenfaced with new proposals. Would it not be possible to put into effect theagreement which had already been made and which was in accordance with thePrime Ministers proposals? The question had now been in suspense since the1st of November.Mr. EDEN said that as far as he knew the Tito-Subasic agreement was validand Regents were being set up.M. MOLOTOV said that his information was that nothing was being done.His proposal was that the agreement should be put into effect immediately.Mr. EDEN said that, so far as he knew, there were only one or twoamendments which Subasic wanted to put to Tito.M. MOLOTOV said that what had already been agreed should be carriedout.   They should not leave the Crimea without having decided this question.Mr. EDEN pointed out that the new proposals would contribute to the democratic character of the regime in Yugoslavia, and thought that as such theyshould appeal to the Soviet Government.M. MOLOTOV said that effect could be given later to these new proposals.The important thing was that the agreement should be made effective.Mr. EDEN said that as he understood it, Subasic was on the point of leaving for Yugoslavia, if he had not already left, in order to put the agreement into force.Mr. STETTINIUS suggested that Mr. Eden and M. Molotov should appoint members of their delegation to submit a report on the question for thePlenary Meeting. Mr. EDEN and M. MOLOTOV agreed and appointedMr. Dixon and M. Vyshinski respectively.M. MOLOTOV emphasised&quot; once again his desire that., agreement should bereached before the Crimea Conference broke up on the putting into force of theTito-Subasic agreement.7. Conclusions.(a) As regards Poland, it was decided to report that no agreement had beenreached.(&amp;) As regards reparation, it was decided to report that the United Statesand Soviet Delegations had agreed that the total figure of 20 billiondollars should be named as a basis of discussion by the reparations commission, and that the U.S.S.R. share should be mentioned as50 per cent, of the total received.  The British position was reserved.
(c) As regards World Organisation it was agreed that China and france should be consulted before the invitation was issued, and that thequestion of territorial trusteeship should be taken up between theGovernments on a diplomatic level before the Conference.(d) As regards Yugoslavia, it was decided to appoint a sub-committee of theRussian and British Delegations to report.ANNEX I.Suggestions in Regard to the Polish Governmental Question.After further consideration I agree with M. Molotov&apos;s statement that thequestion of the creation of a Presidential Committee should be dropped and am therefore prepared to withdraw our suggestion on that point.I believe that, with this change, our three positions are not far apart onthe substance of the governmental question. M. Molotov spoke of the reorganisa-tion of the Polish Government. The British formula suggests the establishmentof a fully representative &apos;&apos; Provisional Polish Government&apos;&apos; and we speak of theformation of a &quot;Government of National Unity.&quot; All three agree that onlythe Poles themselves can definitely decide this. All three agree that this Govern -ment should be composed of members of the present Polish Provisional Governmentand in addition representatives of other democratic elements inside Poland andsome Polish democratic leaders from abroad.The following formula might therefore be considered : That the present Polish Provisional Government be reorganised intoa fully representative Government based on all democratic forces in poland and including democratic leaders from Poland abroad, to be termed &quot; TheProvisional Government of National Unity&quot;; M. Molotov, Mr. Harrimanand Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to be authorised to consult in the first instance in,Moscow with members of the present Provisional Government and otherdemocratic leaders from within Poland and from abroad with a view to there organisation of the present Government along the above lines. This&quot; Government of National Unity &quot; would be pledged to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrageand secret ballot in which all democratic parties would have the right toparticipate and to put forward candidates.When a &apos;&apos; Polish Government of National Unity &apos;&apos; is satisfactorilyformed, the three Governments will then proceed to accord it recognition. The&apos; Ambassadors of the three Powers in Warsaw following such recognitionwould be charged with the responsibility of observing and reporting totheir respective Governments on the carrying out of the pledge in regardto free and unfettered elections.ANNEX II.Formula Suggested by Mr. Eden.The three Governments consider that a new situation has been&apos; created bythe complete liberation of Poland by the Red Army. This calls for the estab-lishment of a fully representative Provisional Polish Government which can nowbe more broadly based than was possible before the recent liberation of westernPoland. This Government should comprise members of the present ProvisionalGovernment at Warsaw and other democratic Polish leaders from within poland and from Poles abroad. The new Government, thus established, should be termed&quot; the Provisional Government of National Unity.&quot; M. Molotov, Mr. Harriman,Sir A. Clark Kerr, &amp;c.
ANNEX III.Basic Principles of Exaction of Reparations from Germany for Study and recommendation by the Moscow Reparations Commission.1. Reparations are to be received in the first instance by those countrieswhich have borne the main burden of the war and have suffered the heaviestlosses and have organised victory over the enemy.2. Setting aside for the moment the use of German labour by way of reparations, this question to be considered at a later date, reparations in kind areto be exacted from Germany in the two following forms : &apos;(a) Removal in a single payment in the end of the war from the national wealth of Germany located on the territory of Germany herself as wellas outside her territory (equipment, machine-tools, ships, rolling-stock,German investment abroad, shares of industrial, transport, shipping and other enterprises in Germany, &amp;c), these removals to be carriedout chiefly for the purpose of military and economic disarmament ofGermany.These removals are to be completed within two years of the endof the war.(h) Annual deliveries of commodities during 10 years after the end ofthe war.3. The total of German reparations in the form of removal from hernational wealth as well as in the form of annual deliveries of commodities afterthe end of the war shall be the first subject of study by the Moscow Commission.In this study the Commission will take into consideration the effect of whatevercommon steps ought to be taken for the elimination or reduction of output ofvarious important German industries, from the standpoint of the totaldemilitarisation. The Commission should consider in its initial studies the soviet governments suggested total of twenty billion dollars for all forms of reparation.ANNEX IV.Draft Form of Invitation.The Government of the United States of America, on behalf of itself and ofthe Governments of the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicsand the Republic of China and of the Provisional Government of the french republic, invites the Government of to send representatives to a Conference of the United Nations to be held on the 25th April, 1945, or soonthereafter, at , in the United States of America, to prepare a Charter for a General International Organisation for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.The above-named Governments suggest that the Conference consider asaffording a basis for such a Charter the Proposals for the Establishment of aGeneral International Organisation, which were made public last October, andwhich have now been supplemented by the following provisions for Section C of chapter VI : &quot; C- Voting.1. Each member of the Security Council should have one vote.2. Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters should bemade by an affirmative vote of seven members.3. Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters should be madeby an affirmative vote of seven members, including the concurring votes ofthe permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VIII,Section A, and under the second sentence of paragraph 1 of Chapter VIII,- Section C, a party to a dispute should abstain from voting.&quot;[The above-named Governments have agreed that it would, in their opinion,be desirable that consideration be given at the forthcoming Conference to theinclusion in the projected Charter of provisions relating to territorialtrusteeships and dependent areas. They hope to be able to prepare and place before the Conference proposals relating to these subjects.]
ANNEX V.Draft Conclusion on Persia.The remarkable progress made in the war against Germany has enabled theAmerican, British and Russian representatives to consider the application ofArticle 5 of the Tripartite Treaty of Alliance between the United Kingdom andthe Soviet Union and Persia regarding the withdrawal of Allied forces fromPersian territory. It has been agreed that a commencement of the withdrawal of forces need not await the termination of hostilities, but should begin part passuin stages as military considerations, including the use of the Persian supplyroute, may allow. The stages of this gradual withdrawal, beginning with theevacuation of Tehran, will be discussed and agreed on by the respective militaryauthorities of the three countries. The Persian Government will be kept fully informed.Misunderstandings which have arisen in connexion with applications forrights to develop oil resources in Persia were also discussed in the course of the conversations. It was agreed that in the light of the known views of the PersianGovernment within whose free decision the matter rests, none of the Governmentsinvolved would favour making any suggestions for further oil concessions uponthe Persian Government, pending the withdrawal of Allied troops from Persia.ANNEX VI.When Dr. Subasic returns to Belgrade with his Government about the7th February, he intends to raise two outstanding points with Marshal Tito.His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it important that Marshal Tito should be in aposition to give satisfactory assurances on both these points, and therefore hopethat Marshal Stalin will agree to advise Marshal Tito in this sense.2. The. first of these points is that AVNO-J should be extended to include members of the last Yugoslav Skupshtina who have not compromised themselves,thus&apos;forming a body to be called a temporary Parliament.3. The second point is that legislative acts passed by AVNOJ should besubject to ratification by a Constituent Assembly. This could be arranged either(1) under Article 116 of the Constitution, which lays down that all measures takenin accordance therewith should be.subject to ratification, or (2) by introducing a passage in the new Governments declaration agreed between Marshal Tito and dr. Subasic. The latter would be the more satisfactory course. It would also be helpful if the new Governments declaration could include a statement to the effectthat the Government was only temporary, pending free expression of the will ofthe people.6th February, 1945.Further information as to arrangements will be transmitted subsequently.In the event that the Government of . desires in advance ofthe Conference to present views or comments concerning the proposals, theGovernment of the United States will be pleased^to transmit such views andcomments to the other participating Governments.

The Polish Question.2. Reparation.3. World Organisation.4. Persia.5. Yugoslavia.The relevant extracts from the report and the ensuing discussion is recorded in the following items.1. Poland.Mr. STETTINIUS read the following report from the Foreign ministers on the Polish question : &quot; The Foreign Ministers discussed at length the Polish Governmentalquestion on the basis of a memorandum submitted by the American Delega-tion. This memorandum, in accordance with M. Molotov&apos;s proposal, agreedto drop the question of the creation of a Presidential Committee.&quot; With respect to reaching a formula on the question of the PolishGovernment, M. Molotov stated that he wished to present to Marshal Stalincertain new considerations advanced in the American memorandum before making a final statement. It was decided to continue discussion of thisquestion at a later date and to report that the three Foreign Ministersthus far had not reached an agreement on the matter.&quot;
M. MOLOTOV said that he had some new suggestions to put forward onthe Polish question. These took the form of amendments to a document putforward by the United States Government making suggestions in regard tothe Polish Governmental question.The Conference agreed to discuss these amendments forthwith.The following is the text of the United States document: &quot; Suggestions in Regard to the Polish Governmental Question.&quot;&quot;After further consideration I agree with M. Molotov&apos;s statement that the question of the creation of a Presidential Committee should be dropped and am therefore prepared to withdraw our suggestion on that point.&quot;I believe that, with this change, our three positions are not farapart on the substance of the governmental question. M. Molotov spoke of the reorganisation of the Polish Government. The British formulasuggests the establishment of a fully representative &apos; Provisional PolishGovernment&apos; and we speak of the formation of a &apos; Government of national unity.&apos; All three agree that only the Poles themselves can definitely decidethis. All three agree that this government should be composed of membersof the present Polish Provisional Government and in addition representa-tives of other democratic elements inside Poland and some Polish democraticleaders from abroad.&quot; The following formula might therefore be considered : &quot; That the present Polish Provisional Government be reorganised intoa fully representative Government based on all democratic forces in poland and including democratic leaders from Poland abroad, to be termedc The Provisional Government of National Unity&apos;; M. Molotov,Mr. Harriman and Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to be authorised to consult in. the first instance in Moscow with members of the present Provisional Govern-ment and other democratic leaders from within Poland and from abroadwith a view to the reorganisation of the present Government along the above lines. This &apos; Government of National Unity&apos; would be pledged to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as practicable on the basisof universal suffrage and secret ballot in which all democratic parties wouldhave the right to participate and to put forward candidates.&quot; When a &apos; Polish Government of National Unity&apos; is satisfactorilyformed, the three Governments will then proceed to accord it recognition.The Ambassadors of the three Powers in Warsaw following such recognitionwould be charged with the responsibility of observing and reporting to theirrespective Governments on the carrying out of the pledge in regard to free and unfettered elections.&quot;M. MOLOTOV said that the Russians would like to reach agreement on thebasis of the United States document subject to some amendments. These were as follows : They would like the first sentence of the formula to read as follows  That the present Provisional Government of Poland should be reorganised on a wider democratic basis with the inclusion of democraticleaders from Poland itself and also from those living abroad. this government would be called the National Provisional Government ofPoland.&quot;He had withdrawn his former paragraph, in which he had stated that there organisation of the Provisional Government would proceed on the basijs of theexisting Government.No alterations were proposed in the next two sentences.  He wished, however to delete the last line and a half of the paragraph after the words &quot; secretballot &quot; and to substitute for- the rest of the sentence the following :_.... &quot;In these elections&quot; all non-Fascist and anti-Fascist democraticparties should have the right to take part and put forward candidates.&quot;M. MOLOTOV proposed the last paragraph should read as follows : &quot; When a P*polish Government of National Unity has been formed on thelines laid down above, the three Governments will proceed to recognise it &quot;[29177] l
He wanted to omit the final sentence which referred to the Ambassadors of thethree Powers being charged with the responsibility for observing and reportingto their Governments on the carrying-out of the elections. This sentence wouldhurt the amour-propre of the Poles.Subject to these amendments, M. Molotov thought that Mr. Stettinius&apos;s state-ment formed a satisfactory basis for agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER said that.he was glad that so considerable an advance had been made towards reaching agreement on the urgent and imminentPolish question. He wished, however, to make an observation of a general character. He hoped the President would forgive him if it cut across what hadbeen said about movements at the end of the Conference. The Conference hadabout it an atmosphere of agreement. But there was also a desire to put a footin the stirrup and be off. We could not afford to allow the settlement of these important matters to be hurried, and the fruits of the Conference lost for lack of another twenty-four hours. A great prize was in view and decisions taken mustbe unhurried. These might well be among the most important days in the lives ofthose present.[At this point it was agreed to break off the discussion of Poland until theother matters in the report of the Foreign Ministers had been dealt with.]2. Reparation.Mr. STETTINIUS read, the following report from the foreign secretaries :  -&quot; The American Delegation submitted a draft proposal on the basic principles of exacting reparations from Germany for study and recommenda-tion by the Moscow Reparations Commission.Agreement was reached on the first two points relative to which countries should receive reparations, and to the types of reparations in kind germany should pay.The Soviet and American Delegations reached agreement on the wording ofthe third (Final) point to the effect that the Reparations Commission should consider in its initial studies as a basis for discussion the suggestion of the SovietGovernment that the total sum of the reparations in accordance with thepoints (a) and (&amp;) of the preceding paragraph should be 20 billion dollars and that50 per cent, of it should go to the Soviet Union.Mr. Eden stated that he would be obliged to await instructions from hisGovernment.The Soviet Delegation stated that reparations payments would be based upon1938 prices, having possibly in mind increases of 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, onthe prices of the items delivered.&quot;&quot;The Conference Took note of this report, and of the fact that Mr. Eden had stated thathe must await instructions from his Government.3. World Organisation.Mr. STETTINIUS read the following report from the foreign secretaries: &quot; It was agreed that the five Governments which will have permanentseats on the Security Council should consult each other prior to the united nations Conference on the subjects of territorial trusteeship and dependentareas.&quot;It was. also agreed that these subjects should be discussed at theUnited Nations Conference itself.&quot; The Sub-Committee appointed yesterday is continuing its work andwill report to the Foreign Ministers to-day. This report will include matterspertaining to the form of the invitation to the forthcoming Conference. Thissubject was discussed at to-day5s meeting, and there appears to be an identitynf views thereon.&quot;
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he could not agree, at any rate without consultation with the Dominions, to any British territory being made the subjectof a system under which it would be open to other Powers to make criticisms ofthe work which we had done in our Colonies, and which called upoii us to justify our standard of administration.Mr. STETTINIUS explained that all that the resolution contemplated wasto make it possible for the World Organisation to create a Territorial Trusteeshipif it so desired. This might well be necessary in order to deal with territoriestaken from the Japanese. There was also the question of what would happen tothe mandated territories of the League of Nations when that organisation waswound up., THE PRIME MINISTER said that his objection would be met if it wasmade clear that the proposed system of territorial trusteeship would not in anyway affect the integrity of the British Commonwealth and Empire.The Conference -Agreed to accept the recommendations of the Eoreign Secretaries on thismatter, subject to an amendment to make it clear that TerritorialTrusteeship would only apply to (a) existing mandates of the League of Nations;(b) territory detached from the enemy as a result of the present war; and(c) any other  territory  which might be voluntarily placed  under trusteeship.Furthermore, it might be made clear that it would be a matter for subsequent agreement which territories within the above categorieswould be placed under trusteeship; that no discussion of actualterritories was contemplated at the forthcoming United nations conference; that only machinery and principles of trusteeship wouldbe formulated by the Conference for inclusion in the Charter.4. Persia.Mr. STETTTNIUS read the following report from the Foreign Ministers : &quot; Sufficient time had not elapsed to permit the Soviet Delegation to giveproper study to a paper submitted by Mr. Eden on this question. The subject was consequently not discussed.&quot;5. Yugoslavia.Mr. STETTINIUS read the following report from the Foreign Ministers : &quot; On the proposal of the Chairman, it was agreed that representativesof Mr. Eden and M. Molotov should be appointed to draw up a statement onthe Yugoslav situation.&quot; There was also agreement that before the termination of the Crimea conference it would be desirable that agreement should be reached on theexecution of the Subasic-Tito Agreement.&quot;M. MOLOTOV pointed out tha.t the Tito-Subasic agreement had been signed on the 11th January, and the Prime Minister had said that he had intended toenforce it irrespective of King Peter&apos;s wishes. Nevertheless, the agreement hadnot been put into operation, and the British representatives now suggested twoamendments.. MARSHAL STALIN said that if Marshal Tito was asked to make further amendments, counter-amendments might be made and there would be endlessdelay.   The Yugoslav Government was in a difficult position.Mr. EDEN said that it was not altogether correct to speak of amendments tothe Tito-Subasic agreement. What was in question was two assurances which Dr.. Subasic would ask from Marshal Tito when he saw him. If Marshal Titoagreed to give these assurances, the agreement would come into force at once.[29177] l 2
MARSHAL STALIN said that, as he understood the matter, these two points were first that all the old members of the Skuptshina, other than those whohad compromised themselves, should be included in the anti-Fascist Avnoj.Secondly, that the legislation of the anti-Fascist Avnoj should ultimately be confirmed by the Constituent Assembly. His personal view was that these suggestions were acceptable. Once the new Government had been formed, hethought they would be in a position to see that these assurances were given. Theimmediate step, however, was to proceed without delay with the formation of anew Government.Mr. EDEN said that as be understood the Marshal&apos;s suggestion, it was thatthe agreement would come into force at once, and that the Russian and british governments would then recommend Marshal Tito to give these assurances.THE CONFERENCE-Agreed that the matter should be settled on this basis.MARSHAL STALIN said that he thought it was important that, before themeeting separated and the heads of Governments left the Crimea, the Tito-Subasic agreement should be put into effect, and the new Government formed onthe basis of the agreement, irrespective of King Peter&apos;s fancies.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed with this view, and thought that thispoint should figure in the agreed communique. He knew that he could then rely on Marshal Stalin&apos;s goodwill in asking the new Government to give these additional assurances.MARSHAL STALIN said that when he made a statement he would carry it out.MARSHAL STALIN asked if Dr. Subasic had yet left England forBelgrade.Mr. EDEN said that Dr. Subasic had been due to leave on the 7th February,and if he had not left it was only because he had been held up by the weather.He had sent a telegram on the previous night to enquire if he had left and hoped to report on the following day.6. Poland.After a short interval the Conference resumed the discussion of the polish question.THE PRESIDENT said that they had discussed the document on Polandinformally during the interval and had come to the conclusion that the differences between themselves and the Russians were largely a matter of the use of words.They were nearer than ever before, and there was a real chance that they could get this document into a form on which they could all agree, and so reach asolution of the Polish question till an election could be held.He wanted to give two examples of this use of words. M. Molotov had suggested &quot; The present Polish Government should be organised on a widerbasis.&quot; That was difficult for those countries which recognised not the lublin government but the London Government.M. MOLOTOV said that these words were taken direct from Mr. Stettinius&apos;sproposals, but THE PRESIDENT said that his suggestion was &quot;The PolishGovernment now functioning in Poland.&quot;   That perhaps was a matter of detail.But M. Molotov had also proposed to eliminate the last sentence of theAmerican draft which read &quot; The Ambassadors of the three Great Powers in Warsaw following-such recognition would be charged with the responsibility of observing and reporting to their respective Governments on the carrying out of the pledgein regard to free and unfettered elections.&quot;THE PRESIDENT said that he would like to ask on behalf of somesix million Poles in the United States for some assurance that the electionsreally would be honest and free. He therefore thought that with a little more work by the three Foreign Secretaries that evening, they might be able to getthe text agreed for the following da&apos;y&apos;s session, and he therefore suggested thatthe mfitter should be referred back to the Foreign Secretaries.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed with all the President had said about the continuous progress that was being made towards a uniteddeclaration by the three principal Powers. He also agreed that the documentshould be tidied up by the three Foreign Secretaries, arid that they should reporton the following day.There were two points which he wanted to mention now. The first was asmall point and arose out of something which Marshal Stalin had said theprevious day. He had said that the liberation of Poland and the driving out ofthe enemy was a great new fact. He thought it would be a good thing to make that point before the whole world and therefore suggested that the statement should begin with the following paragraph :-&quot; A new situation has been created by the complete liberation of Polandby the Red Army. This calls for a fully representative Provisional PolishGovernment which can now be more broadly based than was possible beforethe liberation of Poland.&quot;That would give a good opportunity for the statement they hoped to make to bewell received by the world. It was perhaps ornament, but it was very importantornament.The second point was much more important and concerned the last sentence of the American draft. The Prime Minister wished to make an appeal to marshal stalin. His Majesty&apos;s Government were at a great disadvantage in discussingPolish affairs because they really knew little of what was actually going on, yetthey had to take decisions of great responsibility. Rut they did know of thebitter feelings among the Poles and the very fierce language which had been used by M. Osubka-Morawski. He had been informed that the Lublin Government hadopenly declared its intention to try as traitors all members of the Polish HomeArmy and Underground Movement. That caused him very great anxiety anddistress, and was a matter of great perplexity to him in forming his views. Ofcourse, he put first the non-hampering of the operations of the Red Army. But hewould like Marshal Stalin, with his patience and kindness, to consider thedifficulty of the British position. The British Government did not know whatwas going on inside Poland, except through dropping brave men by parachuteand bringing members of the Underground Movement out. They had no other means of knowing, and did not like getting their information in that way. Howcould this be remedied without in any way hampering the movements of the red army \ Could any facilities be granted to the British (and no doubt the UnitedStates would wish to participate in anything that was granted) in order to see how these Polish quarrels were being settled? That was why they thought this last sentence of the American draft was so important. Tito had said that whenelections took place in Yugoslavia he would not object to Russian, British and american observers being present to report impartially to the world that they hadbeen carried out fairly. So far as Greece was concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would greatly welcome it, when the elections were held as soon as possible,if American, Russian and British observers were there to make sure that thebusiness was conducted as the people wished. The same question would arise in italy. When northern Italy was delivered there would be a vast change in. theItalian political situation, and there would have to be an election before forming a constituent assembly or Parliament. The British formula there was the same Russian^ American and British observers should be present to assure the world that everything had been done in a fair way.To show that these were no idle requests, the Prime Minister said that, inEgypt, for instance, the elections were won by whatever Government conductedthem. Nahas Pasha had quarrelled with the King and wanted to hold an election,but the King replied &quot; Not while you are in office,&quot; and of course whenNahas Pasha was turned out the King&apos;s people had won the elections hands down.MARSHAL STALIN said that he did not believe much in Egyptianelections as there was a great deal of corruption there. He asked what was thepercentage of literacy in Egypt and pointed out that in Poland it was about70 per cent.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he did not mean to compare poland and Egypt, but merely to point out the importance of carrying out elections fairly.For instance -would Mikolajczyk be able to go back, to Poland and organise his party for the elections ?
MARSHAL STALIN said that that should be considered by the ambassadors and M. Molotov with the Poles in accordance with the decisions which had been reached. ,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he must be able to tell the House ofCommons that the elections would be free and that there would be effectiveguarantees that they were freely and fairly carried out.MARSHAL STALIN pointed out that M. Mikolajczyk was a representativeof the Peasant Party which, as it was not a Fascist party, would be able to take part in the elections and its candidates would be.allowed to stand.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this would be still more certain if the peasant Party were already represented in the Polish Government, and marshal STALIN agreed that the Government should include a PeasantParty representative.THE PRIME MINISTER said that they would have to leave it at that,and added that he hoped that nothing he had said had given offence; since nothinghad been further from his heart.MARSHAL STALIN said they would have to hear what the Poles had tosay.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he wanted to be able to carry theeastern frontier question through Parliament, and he thought that would bepossible if Parliament was satisfied that the Poles had been able to decide for themselves what it was that they wanted.MARSHAL STALIN observed that there were some very good peopleamong them. They were good fighters (the Prime Minister agreed) and therehad been-&apos; good scientists, musicians, &amp;c. among them. But they were veryquarrelsome.THE PRIME MINISTER said that all he wanted was to ensure that all sides got a fair hearing.THE PRIME MINISTER continued by saying that he did not much likethe division between Fascists and non-Fascists, on the grounds that anybody couldcall anybody else anything. He would therefore prefer the words &quot; democraticforces.&quot;MARSHAL STALIN said that he had before him a declaration on liberatedEurope (see Annex). On the whole, he approved of this document, and in it he found a paragraph reading : &apos;&apos; The establishment of order in Europe and the rebuilding of national economic life&quot; must be achieved by processes which willenable the liberated peoples to destroy the last vestiges of Nazism and Fascism.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said that he entirely agreed with that, as it wasthe beating down of the old tyrannies, and he agreed when MARSHAL STALINsaid that there was no unity of any kind between Democrats and Fascists. .THE PRESIDENT said that this question of free elections was important,as Poland was one of the first examples of a country starting life again in liberated Europe. The clause read out by Marshal Stalin continued : &quot;&quot;and tocreate democratic institutions of their own choice.&quot; The President then went onto read the next paragraph of the declaration, and MARSHAL STALIN saidthat the Soviet Government accepted it.THE PRESIDENT said that he wanted this election in Poland to be abovecriticism -like Caesats wife. He wanted an assurance to the world of some kind,and did not want anybody to be in a position to question the purity of theelections.  It was a matter of good politics rather than of principle.M. MOLOTOV said that he was afraid that, if they left the last phraseof the American draft without consulting them, the Poles would feel that theywere not trusted.   It had therefore better be discussed with them.MARSHAL STALIN said that, as regards the Presidents first suggestion,he was prepared to accept the words &quot; Polish Government now functioning in poland.&quot;
7. Declaration on Liberated Europe.THE PRESIDENT referred to the proposed declaration on LiberatedEurope (see Annex). This declaration would apply to all the other countriesliberated in Europe as well as to Poland.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not dissent from this document,but would like it to be on&apos;record that the Atlantic Charter.had been interpreted byhim on his return from Newfoundland in a short statement to the effect that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were already pursuing the principles of the Charter inthe British Empire. He would give the Members of the Conference a copy ofthis statement.Mr. EDEN said that the earlier forms of this document had been drafted asa Four-Power document. He did not want to make any amendments now, butsuggested that it might be left to the Three Powers to associate the French with it later if they thought fit to do so.MARSHAL STALIN said that it would be better to leave it as a Three-Power document.M. MOLOTOV said that he would like to make an addition to the third paragraph from the end, and suggested adding at the end of the sentence thewords &quot; and in this connection support will be given to the political figures ofthose countries who have taken an active part in the struggle against the Germaninvaders.&quot;  He had no other comments to make on the document.THE PRIME MINISTER asked for time to consider the proposed addition,and THE PRESIDENT suggested that it should be left to the three foreign secretaries to consider it.8. Greece.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether the Prime Minister was anxious aboutGreece.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he was, and that he would like tohave elections in Greece as soon as possible. He invited Marshal Stalin to sendobservers to Greece to see that everybody had a fair chance.The Prime Minister added that while they were trying to do their duty in greece they would not try to set up a joint command there. But if Marshal Stalinwished to send any responsible officers they could go where they pleased and seewhatever they liked.MARSHAL STALIN replied that he had complete confidence in british policy in Greece.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed his thanks to Marshal Stalin, and hoped there would be peace there soon, on the basis of no reprisals for participa-tion in the civil war and rebellion.He hoped that the Greeks would all make friends and let U.N.R.R.A. come in and provide food.9. War Criminals.THE PRIME MINISTER then raised the question of the treatment of thosewar criminals whose crimes had no particular geographical location.THE PRESIDENT observed that it was a very complicated question and suggested that it might be better to refer it to the three Foreign Secretaries forconsideration after the conference.MARSHAL STALIN asked the Prime Minister what proposals he wishedto make.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Conference that he had draftedfor the Foreign Secretaries&apos; Conference at Moscow in 1943 proposals aboutsending war criminals back to the places where their crimes had been committed,to be tried by the people of those countries, and the phrase about the grandcriminals whose crimes had no particular geographical location was an egg whichhe had laid himself.  He had had an idea that they should draw up a list of the
ANNEX.Declaration on Liberated Europe.(See Items 6 and 7.)THE Premier of the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics, the PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom and the President of the United States ofAmerica have consulted with each other in the common interests of the peoples of their countries and those of liberated Europe. They jointly declaretheir mutual agreement to concert during the temporary period of instability in liberated Europe the policies of their three Governments in assisting the peoplesliberated from the domination of Nazi Germany and the peoples of the formerAxis satellite States of Europe to solve by democratic means their pressingpolitical and economic problems.The establishment of order in Europe and the rebuilding of national economic life must be achieved by processes which will enable the liberated peoplesto destroy the last vestiges of Nazism and Fascism and to create democraticinstitutions of their own choice. This is a principle of the Atlantic Charter-the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they willlive -the restoration of sovereign rights and self-government to those peopleswho have been forcibly deprived of them by the aggressor nations.To foster the conditions in which the liberated peoples may exercise these rights, the three Governments will jointly assist the people in any Europeanliberated State or former Axis satellite State in Europe where in their judgmentconditions require (a) to establish conditions of internal peace; (b) to carry outemergency measures for the relief of distressed peoples; (c) to form interimgrand criminals with power to add to their number. That would separate them from their people, and he personally was inclined to think that they should be shotas soon as they were caught and their identity established.MARSHAL STALIN said what about Hess ?THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he would catch up with the others.MARSHAL STALIN then asked whether prisoners of war could come in the category of war criminals, as up to the present time there seemed to be a general opinion that prisoners of war could not be tried.THE PRIME MINISTER replied, that prisoners of war who committedcrimes against the laws of war had always been liable to be tried. He gathered that Marshal StalhVs view was that the &quot;grand criminals should be tried before being shot.  In other words, it should be a judicial rather than a political act. .MARSHAL STALIN said that was so.THE PRESIDENT said that it should not be too judicial. He wanted tokeep out newspaper correspondents and photographers until the criminals weredead.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that his only suggestion was that theyshould have a clearing of views on this matter. He did not want to say anything in public lest the Germans should retaliate on our prisoners.THE CONFERENCE-Agreed that this matter should be examined by the Foreign Secretaries,for report in due course, after the close of the Conference.10. Military Operations.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether the offensive on the Western front had begun. ;THE PRIME MINISTER gave certain details of the offensive that had begun at 10 a,m, the previous day by an attack carried out by British troops fromNijmegen. ;
governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in thepopulation and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive to the will of the people; and (d) to facilitatewhere necessary the holding of such elections.The three Governments will consult the other United Nations and provisionalauthorities or other governments in Europe when matters of direct interest tothem are under consideration.When, in the opinion of the three Governments, conditions in any Europeanliberated State or any former Axis satellite State in Europe make such action necessary, they will immediately establish appropriate machinery for the carrying out of the joint responsibilities set forth in this declaration.By this declaration we reaffirm our faith in the principles of the atlantic charter, our pledge in the Declaration by the United Nations, and our deter-mination to build in co-operation with other peace-loving nations a world order under law, dedicated to peace, security, freedom and general well-being of allmankind.[29177]M
F.S.M, (Argonaut) 8th Meeting.9th February, 1945.EE COED OF A MEETING HELD AT YUSOPOV VILLA AT 10 p.m. on 9th FEBRUARY, 1945.present mr. Eden.Sir A. Cadogan.Sir A. Clark Kerr.Mr. Roberts (Item 1).Mr. Jebb (Item 2).Mr. W. D. Allen (Item 1).Mr. R. Allen.Major Theakstone (Interpreter).M. Molotov.M. Vyshinski.M. Gousev.M. Gromyko.M. Golunski (Interpreter&apos;).Mr. Stettinius.Mr. Harriman.Mr. Matthews.Mr. Bohlen (Interpreter).1. Poland.Mr. EDEN put forward a draft formula for consideration (see Annex 1).He said that the text was substantially the same as that which had been read outby the Prime Minister earlier that afternoon, although there were smallamendments. He thought it right to say that he had received that afternoon atelegram from the War Cabinet expressing the gravest concern at the text whichhe had sent home as a result of previous discussions. He must warn his colleagues that, unless something like the text which he had just put forward could beaccepted, there was not the faintest hope of agreement.M. MOLOTOV said that the present text appeared to differ from the earliertexts and from the document read out by the Prime Minister that afternoon.The telegram from the War Cabinet had not been mentioned until that moment.Mr. EDEN said that the telegram had nothing to do with the present text,which had been drafted before it had been received. This text was substantially the same as the text which M. Molotov had had in his hands for the last two anda half days. Unless the British text were taken as a basis for discussion, he saw no purpose in continuing these discussions.It was agreed that the text put forward by Mr. Eden should be consideredby the meeting.There followed a detailed discussion of the text of the proposed formula.M. MOLOTOV objected to the phrase &quot; fully representative Government &quot;;to insert a new notion of a representative Government would give rise to further discussions. He therefore suggested that this phrase be omitted. He did not like the phrase in the next sentence regarding the basis for the new Government;what was wanted was a phrase to the effect that the Government &quot; now acting in Poland&quot; should be reorganised on a broader basis. When this Governmenthad been reorganised they could accord it recognition.Mr. EDEN said that he must be frank. He was not asking the SovietGovernment to recognise a reorganised London Government. On the contrary, theSoviet Government were asking the British and Americans to recognise are organised Lublin Government. What they wanted was to recognisesomething new.After further discussion, this part of the text was agreed.There followed a discussion of the Soviet desire to include the words &quot; anti-Fascist parties5&apos;&apos; with reference to the participation in the elections. It was finally agreed that the words &apos;&apos; democratic and anti-Nazi parties &apos;5 should besubstituted for &apos;&apos; anti-Fascist parties.&apos;&apos;
The question whether it was desirable to include a phrase to the effect that recognition would be accorded when the Polish Provisional Government ofNational Unity had been &quot; satisfactorily formed &quot; was next discussed.M. MOLOTOV felt that the word &quot; satisfactorily&quot; would be offensive tothe Poles, since it suggested that the Great Powers were concerned only withtheir own interests in the matter. If the new Government were not satisfactory to the Americans and the British, naturally no recognition would be accorded.This was self-evident.It was suggested that the phase &apos;&apos; duly formed &apos;&apos; would convey the requiredmeaning without causing offence; but Mr. EDEN pointed out that this might mean only &quot; formed in due course.&quot; M. MOLOTOV did not consider any phraseof the kind was necessary, since the granting or withholding of recognition must always depend on the American and British Governments being satisfied that theterms of the agreement had been carried out.After further discussion it was agreed that the phrase &quot; properly formed inconformity with the above &apos;&apos; should be used.Finally there was considerable discussion regarding the last sentence of theformula, which provided that the British, American and Russian Ambassadorsin Warsaw should observe events in connection with the holding of elections andshould be responsible for reporting to their Governments thereon.M. MOLOTOV thought it impossible to say this without prior consultationwith the Poles.Mr. STETTINIUS thought that a sentence on these lines would betremendously helpful in the United States of America. He felt sure that thePresident would insist on something of this kind.Mr. EDEN said that this was surely only a statement of fact, since everyAmbassador would send back to his Government observations and reports as amatter of course.The Meeting was unable to reach agreement on this point and it was decidedto leave it for consideration on the following .day. The formula in so far asit was agreed by the Meeting is attached at Annex II.2. Declaration on Liberated Europe.The Meeting then considered the text put forward by the American Delega-tion (see Annex to 5th Plenary Meeting).M. MOLOTOV said that he had only one amendment. He would, however,like to ask whether France was included among the countries referred to in theDeclaration.Mr. EDEN thought that this was a good point. Either France was a partyto the Declaration, or she was subject to it.The Meeting then discussed M. Molotov&apos;s amendment (see Annex III).Mr. STETTINIUS thought that the amendment was not pertinent.Mr. EDEN thought that it countenanced undue interference in the affairs of the liberated countries.M. MOLOTOV pointed out that the whole of this Declaration amounted tointerference in the affairs of liberated Europe. He thought that there shouldbe no doubt about our attitude towards those who had fought the Germans andthose who had collaborated with them. His amendment was not intended tohave any bearing on the situation in Greece. He enquired whether Mr. Edenthought it objectionable.Mr. EDEN said he did not quite see how it fitted in with the Declaration.It was agreed to leave a decision on the Russian amendment to the plenary meeting.Mr. EDEN thought that they ought to settle the point about the Frenchand he put forward for consideration a suggested last paragraph (see Annex IV).Mr. STETTINIUS said that he thought well of Mr.Eden5s suggestion, andit was finally agreed to leave further consideration of it until the morning.[29177] m 2
3. Conclusions.(a) As regards the formula for Poland, agreement was reached except forthe last sentence, final consideration of which was deferred until thefollowing day.(&amp;) As regards the Declaration on Liberated Europe, agreement was reachedexcept (1) as regards M. Molotov&apos;s amendment, on which a decision was referred to the Plenary Meeting, and (2) as regards the Britishsuggestion for a final paragraph, consideration of which was deferred until the following day.ANNEX I.British Revised Formula on Poland.(After 5th Plenary Session on 9th February, 1945.)A new situation has been created by the complete liberation of Poland bythe Red Army. This calls for the establishment of a fully representativeprovisional Polish Government which can be more broadly based than waspossible before the recent liberation of Western Poland. This Government shouldbe based upon the Provisional Government now functioning in Poland and upon other democratic Polish leaders from within Poland and from abroad. This new government will be called the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity.M. Molotov, Mr. Harriman and Sir A. Clark Kerr should be authorised to consult in the first instance in Moscow with members of the present ProvisionalGovernment and with other democratic leaders from within Poland and fromabroad with a view to the reorganisation of the present Government along theabove lines. This &quot; Provisional Government of National Unity&quot; would bepledged to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as practicable onthe basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot. In these elections all democraticparties would have the right to take part and to put forward candidates.When a Polish Provisional Government of National Unity has been formed,which the three Governments can regard as fully representative of the Polishpeople, the three Governments will accord it recognition. The Ambassadors ofthe three Powers in Warsaw, following such recognition, would be charged withthe responsibility of observing and reporting to their respective Governments onthe carrying out of the pledge in regard to free and unfettered elections.ANNEX II.Draft for Poland.A new situation has been created in Poland as a result of her completeliberation by the Red Army. This calls for the establishment of a fully repre-sentative Polish Provisional Government which can be more broadly based than was possible before the recent liberation of Western Poland. The ProvisionalGovernment which is now functioning in Poland should therefore be reorganisedon a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from poland itself and from Poles abroad. This new Government should then becalled the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity.M. Molotov, Mr. Harriman and Sir A. Clark Kerr should be authorised, to consult in the first instance in Moscow with members of the present ProvisionalGovernment and with other Polish democratic leaders from within Poland anafrom abroad, with a view to the reorganisation of the present Government along the above lines. This Provisional Government of National Unity would bepledged to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as practicableon the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot. In these elections alldemocratic and anti-Nazi parties would have the right to take part and to putforward candidates.When a Polish Provisional Government of National Unity has been properlyformed in conformity with the above, the three Governments will accord itrecognition.
ANNEX III.M. Molotov&apos;s amendment to 4th paragraph of Declaration on LiberatedEurope.&apos;&apos; And in this connexion support will be given to the political figures ofthese countries who have taken an active part in the struggle against the Germaninvaders.&quot;ANNEX IV.Draft last paragraph of Declaration on Liberated Europe.In issuing this Declaration the three Powers express the hope that theProvisional Government of the French Republic may be associated with them inthe action and the procedure suggested.
F.8.M. (Argonaut) 9th Meeting.10th February, 1945.RECORD OF A MEETING HELD AT VORONTSOV AT 12 noon ON10th FEBRUARY, 1945.present mr. Eden.Sir A. Cadogan.Sir A. Clark Kerr.Mr. Jebb.Mr. Roberts.Mr. Dixon.Mr. Harrison.Mr. Hankey.Mr. W. D. Allen.Mr. R. Allen.Major Theakstone (Interpreter).M. Molotov.M. Vyshinsky.M. Maisky.M. Novikov.M. Gromyko.M. Gousev.M. Pavlov.M. Golunski (Interpreter).Mr. Stettinius.Mr. Matthews.Mr. Hiss.Mr. Page (Interpreter).1. Poland.Mr. STETTINIUS said that in view of the Soviet Delegations objection,he was prepared to withdraw his insistence upon the final sentence in the memor-andum on Poland regarding the responsibility of the Ambassadors of the three powers in connection with observing and reporting on the holding of elections in Poland. His agreement to omit this sentence would be on the understandingthat the President should be perfectly free to make any statement to his own people regarding the receipt of information from the American ambassador at Warsaw.Mr. EDEN said he must make it clear that he, unlike Mr. Stettinius, wasnot prepared to omit the sentence.M. MOLOTOV said that he had some small amendments to the text. Thefirst was the substitution of the word &apos;&apos; possible &apos;&apos; for the word &apos;&apos; practicable&apos;&apos;in paragraph 2 of the draft formula.   This amendment was agreed.Secondly he suggested that instead of the statement in the last paragraph ofthe formula that the three Governments would accord the Polish ProvisionalGovernment of National Unity recognition when it had been properly formed inconformity with the conditions set out, it should be stated that &apos;&apos; the Governmentsof the United States of America and the United Kingdom would establish withthe new Polish Provisional^Government diplomatic relations as had been done bythe Soviet Government.&quot;Mr. STETTINIUS pointed out that the British and Americans would thenbe put in the position of recognising a Government which the Soviet Governmenthad already recognised.   What we wanted was a new Government.It was decided that further consideration of this amendment would benecessary.2. Declaration on Liberated Europe.Mr. STETTINIUS said that he regretted it was impossible for the American delegation to consider the Soviet amendment regarding support for those whohad actively combated the enemy in the liberated countries. This would createuntold difficulties from the domestic standpoint in America.
M. MOLOTOV accordingly agreed to withdraw the Soviet amendment. Hethen suggested that the second part of paragraph 5 of the declaration should heamended to read &quot; they will immediately consult together on the measures necessary to discharge the joint responsibilities set forth in this declaration.&quot;This amendment was accepted.Mr. EDEN enquired about French participation. Would it be possible toconsider the British draft paragraph? (See Annex IV to F.S.M. 8th Meeting.)The draft paragraph was favourably received by the American Delegation andM. Molotov promised to study it and to give his answer by 4 o&apos;ciock the same afternoon.3. Yugoslavia: Tito-Subasic Agreement.Mr. EDEN made a statement about the position in the light of the latest information from London. He understood that there was no difficulty about theexecution of the agreement. Dr. Subasic and his party were due to leave Londonimmediately for Yugoslavia. The discussions in London appeared to have centredaround the names of the Regents, but there was no reason to hold up theexecution of the agreement. He proposed that they should adopt Marshal Stalin&apos;suggestion for a draft message to Tito and Subasic, setting out the views of thethree Powers.This was agreed.On M. Molotov&apos;s suggestion it was also agreed that a statement referring to the identity of views on Yugoslavia should be included in the final communiqueof the conference.4. Reparation.Mr. EDEN said that he was now in a position to make briefly certain points on the Russian proposals.  These were as follows : (a) The British Delegation thought that reparation should be considered inrelation to dismemberment.(&amp;) It seemed difficult to reconcile the two main Russian objects, namely,depletion of German industrial capacity and payment of large annualsums. The British were anxious to avoid a situation arising wherethey had to finance and feed Germany later as a result of reparationstaken out of Germany at an earlier stage.(c) The British were in favour of having the French on the* ReparationCommission from the start.(d) The reparation picture should be considered as a whole, including thelabour situation.(e) The British Government could not agree to state a figure before theReparation Commission^ examination.(/) Any proposal adopted should be without prejudice to the restitution ofproperty taken by the Germans.(g) The British Government would have-to reserve their position regarding-pre-war claims.(h) The British Government were in favour of the Commission starting work as soon as possible.M. MOLOTOV said that, if no figure were mentioned, there would be no basis for the work of the Commission.  There would be no principles to guide it.Mr. EDEN said that the British Government were prepared to agree to theprinciples put forward by the Soviet delegation, namely, the immediate with-drawal of machinery, &amp;c, and the payment of annual contributions. &apos;Mr. EDEN had a redraft (see- Annex 1) of the Russian proposals which hewould like to show to M. Maisky.M. MOLOTOV said he would like to consider this redraft.M. MAISKY said that he thought the British reply disappointing. It wasnot so much the actual points made which he found disappointing as the spiritof the reply. The British spirit seemed to be to take from Germany as little aspossible.Mr. EDEN said that he had said nothing of the kind. He did, however,think it possible that the Russians would not get as much as they hoped.
M. MAISKY said that he would deal with some of the British points. he agreed that the plan should be adjusted to suit dismemberment. Secondly, he did not agree that there was any difficulty in reconciling the Russian objects.The problem had been considered by the Soviet Government from the start, andhe thought that it would be quite possible for Germany to make the annual payments after the lump sum had been taken. Other points should be discussed by the Reparation Commission. As regards the total figure, the British Govern-ment would not be committed to it by agreeing to its insertion merely as a basis for discussion.It was agreed that the Russians should put forward their comments onthe British redraft.M. MAISKY confirmed that the Soviet proposal did not apply to Austria.5. Communique on the Work of the Conference.On Mr. Stettinius&apos;s suggestion it was agreed that the Plenary meeting should be asked to assign to the Foreign Ministers the duty of drafting the finalcommunique.6. World Organisation.The report of the Sub-Committee (see Annex II) was adopted as regards(a) consultation with China and France, and (5) the form of the invitation.7. Austro^ Yugoslav Frontier.Mr. EDEN said that he wished to draw attention to two problems whichmight arise in the event of the surrender of Austria and the allocation of zoneson the basis of the proposals at present before the E.A.C. We wanted to avoid the kind of trouble that had arisen in Greece. He therefore put in a note(Annex III) on the subject.The American and Soviet Delegations agreed to study this note and to give their views as soon as possible.8. Italo-Yugoslav Frontier.Mr. EDEN also put in a note (Annex IV) on this subject, on which theAmerican and Soviet Delegations agreed to give their views later.9. Yugoslav-Bulgarian Relations.* Mr. EDEN said he would be glad to have M. Moiotov&apos;s views on this question.M. MOLOTOV said that Mr. Stettinius was also interested in the questionof an alliance between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.A note had recently been received by the Peoples&apos; Commissariat for ForeignAffairs from His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Moscow, raising objection to a possibleYugoslav-Bulgarian federation. In reply the Soviet Government had stated thatthe question of such a federation was not actual, but that conversations were going on between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia regarding the conclusion of a treatyof friendship and alliance. The Soviet Government took a favourable view ofsuch a proposal; indeed it seemed natural, in view of the fact that the Bulgarianswere now co-operating with the Yugoslavs against German troops in Yugoslavia.The Soviet Government were, however, puzzled by the attitude of the BritishGovernment in regard to a possible Yugoslav-Bulgarian federation, since only amonth ago they had received a note from the British Government advocating ageneral Balkan federation including possibly Turkey.Mr. EDEN said that he was glad to hear that, in M. Molotov&apos;s opinion, thequestion of a Yugoslav-Bulgarian federation was not actual. A possible treaty,however, also seemed to raise a serious issue of principle. It was the British viewthat an enemy State, whose affairs were regulated by an armistice regime, wasdebarred from entering into treaties. This was certainly so without the permis-sion of the victorious Powers which had imposed the armistice.Apart from the question of principle, he was also anxious about the effect which a treaty might have upon the reparations which all had agreed that Greece
11. Persia.Mr. EDEN enquired whether M. Molotov had considered the document which he had put before him, suggesting that a reference should be made to persia in the final communique.M. MOLOTOV said he had read the British draft but he had nothing to add to his previous expression of viewrs. He considered any reference to Persia inthe communique undesirable.Mr. STETTINIUS suggested that they might include in the communiquea reference to the fact that Persian problems had been discussed and the situationclarified.M. MOLOTOV said that he did not favour this proposal.Mr. EDEN suggested that they might say that Persian problems had been examined and that it was desired to reaffirm the Tehran Declaration.iM. MOLOTOV said he could not approve of this suggestion.12. Conclusions.(a) A minor Soviet amendment to the draft formula on Poland was agreed.It was agreed to defer a decision upon a second amendment.(&amp;) As regards the Declaration on Liberated Areas, a Soviet amendment to the text was accepted.   The Soviet Delegation agreed to withdraw their amendment of the previous day.It was agreed to defer a decision upon the British amendment.[29177] nshould obtain from Bulgaria. He proposed to put in a separate aide-memoire onthis subject.M. MOLOT.OV said that all the obligations of Bulgaria under the armisticeremained in force, and could not be changed without the permission of the occupy-ing powers. The British Government, however, had not previously objected tothe conclusion of treaties between former enemy and friendly countries, althoughit had been agreed that enemy States were debarred from entering into treaties with other enemy States. Indeed their assent to such treaties might be impliedfrom their suggestion of a federal scheme for the Balkans.Mr. EDEN said that his point was that a country under an armistice regimecould not make a treaty with any other country except with the explicitpermission of the occupying powers. No federation for the Balkans was contemplated until the armistice regime had come to an end.Mr. STETTINIUS said that he was in accord with Mr. Eden&apos;s views.Mr. EDEN suggested that the Bulgarian and Yugoslav Governments shouldbe told by the Three Powers to do nothing in this connection for the present.M. MOLOTOV thought that the three Powers should limit themselves forthe present to an exchange of views.Mr. STETTINIUS suggested that the British and American Ambassadorsin Moscow should discuss the matter further with M. Molotov.M. MOLOTOV promised to consider the whole matter and to give his viewson the following day.10. South-Eastern Europe.The British Delegation put in notes for the consideration of their colleagues on the following subjects : (a) The Control Commission in Bulgaria (Annex V).(b) Greek claims upon Bulgaria, more particularly with reference to reparations (Annex VI).(c) Oil Equipment in Roumania (Annex VII).
(c) It was agreed that Marshal Stalin&apos;s suggestion for a draft message toTito and Subasic should be adopted, and that a statement referring to the identity of views on Yugoslavia should be included in the finalcommunique of the Conference.(d) It was agreed that the Plenary Meeting should be asked to assign tothe Foreign Ministers the duty of drafting the final communique.(e) The report of the sub-Committee on the United Nations conference was adopted.(/) It was agreed that the American and Soviet Delegations should give theirviews as soon as possible on the British notes regarding the Austro-Yugoslav and Italo-Yugoslav frontiers.- ANNEX I.Basic Principles of Exaction of Reparation from Germany.1. The proportions in reparation allotted to the claimant countries shallbe determined according to their respective contributions to the winning of thewar and the degree of the material loss which they have suffered. Account shallbe taken of deliveries made to the claimant countries by other enemy countries.2. Reparation is to be exacted from Germany in the three following-forms : (a) Removals within two years from the surrender of Germany or the cessation of organised resistance from the national wealth of Germanylocated on the territory of Germany herself as well as outside her territory. These removals to be carried out chiefly for purposesof destroying the war potential of Germany. Subject to the fulfilment of these aims Germany&apos;s industrial capacity will not be reduced toa point which would endanger the economic existence of Germanyand the execution of such obligations as may be imposed on her.(b) Annual deliveries from current production for a period to be considered.(c) Use of German labour and lorry service.3. In fixing the amount of reparation to be exacted under paragraph above account shall be taken of any arrangements made for the dismembermentof Germany, the requirements of the occupying forces and Germany&apos;s need toacquire from time to time sufficient foreign currency from her exports to pay for her current imports and the pre-war claims of the United Nations on Germany.Regarding the Organisation of an Allied Reparation Committee;The Allied Reparation Committee shall be set up on the following basis : 1. The Committee shall consist.of three representatives : one from U.S.S.R.,the United Kingdom and United States. The French ProvisionalGovernment shall also be invited to nominate one representative.Each representative shall be entitled to call in to assist in the workof the Committee any number of experts.2. The function of the Committee shall be to work out a detailed plan forexaction of reparations from Germany according to the principlesadopted at the Crimea Conference of the Three Powers for acceptance. by all Powers concerned, and to make recommendations to theirrespective Governments.3. The Governments represented on the Committee shall determine themoment when the representatives of other Allied Powers will beinvited to participate in the Allied Committee as well as define the forms of participation of these Powers in the Committee.4. The activities of the Committee shall proceed in strict secrecy.5. The Allied Reparation Committee shall be established in Moscow.
ANNEX II,Report of Sub-Committee to the Foreign Ministers.We were instructed on the 8th February to prepare a report to the foreign ministers on the following subjects : (a) The method of consultation with France and China in regard to thedecisions taken at the present conference concerning the proposedworld organisation.(b) The text of the invitation which should be issued to all nations whichwill take Dart in the United Nations Conference.With regard to (a) we consider that the United States on behalf of the three powers should consult the Government of China and the Provisional FrenchGovernment.With regard to (b) we attach for the approval of the Ministers a draftinvitation to all the nations which will take part in the conference.Invitation.The Government of the United States of America, on behalf of itself andof the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet socialist republics, and the Republic of China and of the Provisional Government of theFrench Republic, invites the Government of to send representatives to a Conference of the United Nations to be held on the25th April, 1945, or soon thereafter, at in the United Statesof America to prepare a Charter for a General International Organisation forthe maintenance of international peace and security.The above-named Governments suggest that the Conference consider asaffording a basis for such a Charter the Proposals for the Establishment of aGeneral International Organisation, which were made public last October as aresult of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference,, and which have now. beensupplemented by the following provisions for Section C of Chapter VI: &quot; C.-Voting.1.   Each member of the Security Council should have one vote.2. Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters should bemade by an affirmative vote of seven members.,3. Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters should bemade by an affirmative vote of seven members including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VIII,Section A, and under the second sentence of paragraph 1 of Chapter VIII,Section C, a party to&apos;a dispute should abstain from voting.&quot;Further information as to arrangements will be transmitted subsequently.In the event that the Government of desires in advanceof the Conference to present views or comments concerning -the proposals, theGovernment of the United States of America will be pleased to transmit suchviews and comments to the other participating Governments.ANNEX III.Austro-Yugoslav Frontier.If the British proposals for the allocation of zones of occupation in Austriaare approved, the whole length of the Austro-Yugoslav frontier will be a british responsibility. This may involve us in difficulties with Yugoslavia because,though the Yugoslav Government have not so far asked for any alteration of theStyrian portion of this frontier, they have advanced claims to Klagenfurt andthose parts of Carinthia which they failed to obtain under the Plebiscite heldin 1919. Action may be required to resist Yugoslav efforts to assert these claims and to secure the withdrawal of Yugoslav partisans who in the course of operations may well advance into Carinthia and establish control over it. It wouldbe invidious for His Majesty&apos;s Government to be solely responsible for such[29177] n 2
action, and after our experience in Greece we must try to prevent British troops from becoming involved in fighting with Allied partisans. We hope, therefore,that an agreement might be reached between the three Powers for the maintenanceof the 1937 Austro-Yugoslav frontier pending the final territorial settlement andfor joint measures to ensure its maintenance and observance by Yugoslavia.2.   It is therefore suggested we should agree at the present Conference-(a) that pending the final peace settlement the 1937 frontier between austria and Yugoslavia shall be restored;(b) that the maintenance of this frontier as a provisional line of demarcationis the joint interest of the three Powers, and that the U.S.S.R. andthe United States will support any action which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may take to preserve it;(c) that the three Powers should jointly inform the Yugoslav Government of decisions (a) and (b) above and request the Yugoslav Government togive an undertaking to respect the provisional frontier referred toabove.ANNEX IV. &apos; .Italo-Yugoslav Frontier.I should like to draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that theProvince of Venezia Giulia in the north-east of Italy is a potential powdermagazine. It is therefore likely that there will, as the war draws to a close, beclashes in this area between the Yugoslavs and the Italians, and we must preventthese outbursts to the best of our ability.We had originally intended to set up Allied Military Government over thewhole prpvince up to the 1937 frontier, but we now have doubts whether thiswould be a very satisfactory course for the following reasons : Tito has not yetput his views in writing, but he has made it pretty clear that he will not agreeto such a proposal. He certainly intends to administer himself the considerableareas which he claims for Yugoslavia and part of which are already controlled by his Partisans. Even if under extreme pressure he was forced to acceptAllied (British) Military Government, his Partisans would remain in armsthroughout the district, and it would be a miracle if sooner or later they did notobstruct our military administration. We should then have to take forcefulmeasures to assert our authority and fighting might begin. Alternatively, there might be clashes between the Yugoslav Partisans and the Italian Partisans, bothtrying to hold as much territory as they could. In that case also we should haveto intervene to keep the peace by force. I would therefore ask my colleagues toagree to establish some body for the purpose of working out a provisional lineof demarcation in the Venezia Giulia between the area to be controlled by Titoand the area over which we should establish Allied Military Government. Wehave made an attempt ourselves to draw up such a line based for the most parton ethnic considerations. But obviously we cannot jointly agree on a line now;all we can do is to agree to the principle that there should be such a line and thatsome body of technicians should be established for the purpose of determining-it. After that it would no doubt be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to obtainTito&apos;s acceptance of it. But if they do this His Majesty &apos;s Government wouldlike to be able to say that both their Allies agree with the proposal.Finally, I would point out that, in any case, even if the area west [sic: should read &quot;east&quot;] of my suggested provisional line is allotted to Tito, it will benecessary, in the early stages at any rate, for our Supreme Commander to make use of the communications from Trieste northwards, in which case he would haveto take suitable measures to that end. It might later be possible for him toarrange for his communications to Austria to pass further to the west.ANNEX V.Allied (Soviet) Control Commission in Bulgaria.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government regard it as essential (a) that their-representatives in Bulgaria should enjoy reasonable freedom of movement andcommunication, arid (b) that decisions about which they have not been consultedshould not be taken in their name. -  In the case of Hungary, (a) has been
satisfactorily dealt with in the &quot; Statutes of the Allied Control Commission in hungary,&quot; and His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that identical Statutes shouldbe adopted for the Control Commission in Bulgaria in order to meet the points made in the message from Mr. Eden which was delivered, to M. Molotov on or about the 11th December, 1944.His Majesty&apos;s Government also consider that during the first period thereshould be prior consultation with the British and American representatives andthat, should the Soviet Government feel obliged to take any unilateral action on military grounds hot covered in the Armistice, it should be taken on their sole responsibility and in the name of the Soviet Government only.During the second period, i.e., after the conclusion of hostilities withGermany, His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to ensure that (a) The British and American representatives should take their places inthe Control Commissions as full members and should have the rightto attend all their meetings and to participate fully in the considera-tion of all questions before the Commissions. They should also havethe right of direct access to the Bulgarian authorities.(b) Decisions of the Allied Control Commission should be unanimous andits name and authority should be used only where the representativesof all three Powers are in agreement,If the Soviet High Command, being in de facto control of bulgaria through the presence of Soviet troops, insist upon issuingdirectives to the local Government or taking action which has not beenapproved by both the British and American representatives, theyshould act unilaterally in their own name.(c) The extent to which the British and Americans will share in the actualexecutive and administrative work of the Control Commission willbe a matter to be settled on the spot. But they must certainly havethe right to membership of any sub-committee or executive organdealing with matters concerning British and American rights and property.(d) The detailed implications of these proposals should be worked out between the Soviet chairman and the British and American repre-sentatives on the Control Commission on the spot.ANNEX VI.Greek Claims upon Bulgaria, More Particularly in Regard to Reparations.His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned regarding the position in regardto Greek claims against Bulgaria. On the occasion of the signature of theArmistice with Hungary, the Soviet Government informed the Czechoslovakand Yugoslav Governments that they might send representatives to be accreditedto the Hungarian Control Commission for the purpose of dealing with all questions affecting their particular Governments.On the 23rd January the Greek Government, with the support of HisMajesty&apos;s Embassy in Moscow, approached the Soviet Government with a request for facilities in Bulgaria similar to those granted to the Czechoslovak and Yugo-sdav Governments in Hungary. No reply has, however, yet been vouchsafed tothis request by the Soviet Government.The Greek people have suffered very seriously from. Bulgarian depredationsand are in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government entitled to early satisfactionand to immediate reparation deliveries of which Greece stands in urgent need.The Greek Government have already presented to the Bulgarian Control Corn-mission a list of commodities necessary to the Greek economy and due to themin virtue of the Bulgarian Armistice Agreement, the delivery of which to Greecein the immediate future is essential to the maintenance of Greek economy.Deliveries which iare more urgently required comprise, inter alia, food-stuffs,locomotives, agricultural implements and live-stock. Furthermore, in view ofthe decision incorporated in the Hungarian armistice terms allotting to Czecho-slovakia and Yugoslavia fixed sums payable in commodities as reparations overa period of six years, it is, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, equitablethat similar arrangements should be made to fix a lump sum due to Greece byBulgaria to be paid similarly in commodities over a period of six years. Inthe view of His Majesty&apos;s Government a corresponding sum should be allocated to Yugoslavia whidh has also suffered from Bulgarian occupation.   In this
connexion, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to make it clear that, while theyare in general opposed to the fixing of lump sums for reparations to be exactedfrom enemy countries, they consider it only equitable in view of the fact thatlump sums have been allocated to the Soviet, Czechoslovak and Yugoslav Govern -ments under the Roumanian, Finnish and Hungarian armistices that a similarlump sum should now be allocated to Greece and Yugoslavia under the Bulgarianarmistice.His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly trust that the Soviet Governmentwill accede to the proposals put to them on the 23rd January with the supportof His Majesty&apos;s Government concerning Greek representation on the control commission in Bulgaria. They further trust that the Soviet Government will agree to give explicit instructions to the head of the Control Commission in bulgaria that immediate deliveries must be made to Greece in accordance withthe terms of the armistice and that the list already presented by the GreekGovernment to the Soviet Government is to be taken as the basis for determining the nature and amounts of commodities to be delivered. Finally, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are of the opinion that immediate consideration should be givento the question of fixing the total Bulgarian reparation liability to Greece and yugoslavia, if necessary in terms of money.ANNEX VII.Oil Equipment in Roumania.His Majesty&apos;s Government have been glad to note that the Soviet authoritieshave now agreed to stop removing equipment from the oil fields in Roumaniain which British interests are involved and have also agreed that the Ruat plantshould remain in situ. But if the. large quantities of equipment which havealready been removed are not to be returned, His Majesty&apos;s Government considersthat they must be regarded as deliveries on account of reparations, and arrange-ments made for compensating the oil companies. Similarly, the Ruat plantshould be restored to its previous condition and brought into production assoon as possible. As the Soviet Government have made no attempt to refutethe argument advanced by His Majesty&apos;s Government that any equipment whichmay be removed should be regarded as reparation and not as war booty, HisMajesty&apos;s Government can only refer the Soviet Government to the statementof the case which has already been made. It should also be pointed out thatthese difficulties would never have arisen if the Soviet representatives in roumania had discussed problems affecting the Roumanian oil industry withtheir British and American colleagues on the Control Commission instead of taking unilateral action.
Argonaut.  6th Plenary Meeting (Political).10th February, 1945.RECORD OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTERAND MARSHAL STALIN, AT YUSUPOV VILLA, ON10th FEBRUARY, 1945, AT 3 p.m.1. Poland.THE PRIME MINISTER explained the disadvantage for us of not havingrepresentatives in Poland who could keep us informed of what was going on. The alternatives were: official representatives, i.e., an ambassador with anEmbassy staff, or newspaper correspondents, but the latter course was lessdesirable. THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that he would be asked inParliament about the Lublin Government and the Polish elections and it was essential for him to be able to say that he knew what was going on.MARSHAL STALIN replied that, after recognition of the new PolishGovernment, it would be open to us to send an ambassador to Warsaw.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether the ambassador would have free-dom of. movement within the country.MARSHAL STALIN said that, as far as the Red Army command was con-cerned, there could be no interference with his movements, and the Marshalpromised to give the necessary instructions. But there was also the PolishGovernment, with whom we should have to make our own arrangements. he pointed out that de Gaulle also had his representative in Poland.It was agreed that the following should be added to the agreement on Poland :&quot; . . . . As a consequence of the above, recognition would entail an exchange of ambassadors, by whose reports the respective Governments would be informed about.the situation in&apos;Poland.&quot;2. Prisoners of War.THE PRIME MINISTER spoke of the embarrassment caused us by thelarge number of Russian prisoners in the west. We had about 100,000 of them.11,000 had already been transported home, and 7,000 more would leave this month.He wanted to know the Marshal&apos;s wishes about the rest.MARSHAL STALIN hoped they could be sent to Russia as quickly aspossible. He asked that they should not be ill-treated and that they should besegregated from the Germans. The Soviet Government looked upon all of them as Soviet citizens. He asked that there should be no attempt to induce any of themto refuse repatriation. Those who had agreed to fight for the Germans could bedealt with on their return to Russia.THE PRIME MINISTER explained that we were anxious that these prisoners should be repatriated, and the only difficulty arose from a lack ofshipping^ space. As regards segregating them from the Germans, this was difficult in the first instance, but as soon as they were sorted out; they would bekept separate.THE PRIME MINISTER asked how many British prisoners the Red Armynad released during its advance. He begged for good treatment for them : everymother in England was anxious about the fate of her prisoner sons.Present:The Prime Minister.Mr. Eden.Marshal Stalin.M. Molotov.Major BiRse (Interpreter)M. Pavlov (Interpreter).
MARSHAL STALIN replied that.very few British prisoners had been released by the Red Army so far. There might be more as the Russians advanceddeeper into Germany. So far the few British pilots, &amp;c, had been handed overto British liaison officers in Roumania or Bulgaria.THE PRIME MINISTER said we wanted to send liaison officers to theRed Army to look after our men. Until that could be arranged he proposed that-No.. 30 Mission should perform the necessary liaison duties.MARSHAL STALIN agreed.3. Reparation.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether the British Delegation could take theRussian figure for reparation as a basis and could refer the question to the moscow Commission, as agreed with the United States. Was the Soviet figuretoo high ?THE PRIME MINISTER explained that we thought it would be impossibleto collect such a figure from Germany. For ourselves we did not want Germanlabour. We might take over part of German trade and certain raw materials,like potash, timber, &amp;c. But we did not want manufactured goods, which would only mean unemployment for us.MARSHAL STALIN suggested we should take over shares in Germanundertakings.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that by removing factories andequipment from Germany, Russia would be doing us a service, for it would put an end to German exports which could then be replaced by British exports.4. Free German Movement.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether the German generals now in thehands of the Russians were going to be used for purposes other than propaganda.MARSHAL STALIN replied : &quot; God forbid ! &quot;5. Contacts with the Russians.THE PRIME MINISTER felt that the Marshal would agree how desirableit was for the people of their respective countries to have every possible contact with each other.MARSHAL STALIN agreed.6. Lena Bonds.THE PRIME MINISTER asked for more generous treatment on thisquestion.M. MOLOTOV replied for the Marshal and referred to Russian claims tothe Baltic States assets.THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that the Americans hadreceived better treatment than the British.It was agreed that Mr. Eden would pursue this question with M. Molotov.7. Far East.THE PRIME MINISTER asked the Marshal to state his views aboutRussian wishes with regard to the Far East.MARSHAL STALIN said that the Russians wanted a naval base such asPort Arthur. The Americans would prefer the ports to be internationalised.The Russians wanted to have their interests safeguarded. With regard to theChinese Eastern Railway, they contemplated forming a Russo-Chinese Company.THE PRIME MINISTER assured the Marshal that we would welcome theappearance of Russian ships in the Pacific. He was in favour of Russia&apos;s losses of 30 or 40 years ago being made good.
8. Montr eux Convention.MARSHAL STALIN said that he proposed to raise this question at thePlenary Meeting of the Conference. It was intolerable for Russia to be atthe mercy of the Turks, not only in war but in peace, and for Russia to have tobeg the Turks to let her ships go through the Straits. The regime of the Straitsshould be similar to that of the Suez Canal: Japan was in a better position thanRussia under the present arrangements.THE PRIME MINISTER said he would support the Russian request fora revision of the Convention.9. Tito-Subasic Agreement.It was agreed that a telegram should be sent to Belgrade, embodying thefirst part of the Soviet proposals about putting the agreement into force. Asecond message would be sent later, containing the recommendations suggestedby His Majesty&apos;s Government.[29177]o
Argonaut.  7tfe Plenary Meeting (Political).10th February, 1945.RECORD OF A MEETING HELD AT THE LIVADIA PALACE, YALTA,AT 4-45 p.m. ON 10th FEBRUARY, 1945.Present:Marshal Stalin.M. Molotov.M. Vyshinski.M. Maisky (Interpreter).M. Gousev.M. Gromyko.M. Pavlov.President Roosevelt.Mr. Stettinius.Admiral Leahy.Mr. J. Byrnes.Mr. Harriman.Mr. Hopkins.Mr. Hiss.Mr. Bohlen (Interpreter).Prime Minister.Mr. Eden.Sir A. Cadogan.Sir A. Clark Kerr.Sir E. Bridges.Mr. Dixon.Mr. Harrison (Item 2).Mr. W. D. Allen (Item 1).Mr. Wilson.Major Birse (Interpreter).1. Poland.Mr. EDEN reported that the three Foreign Secretaries had now reached agreement on the following draft statement about Poland : &apos;&apos; A new situation has been created in Poland as a result of her completeliberation by the Red Army. This calls for the establishment of a fullyrepresentative Polish Provisional Government which can be more broadlybased than was possible before the recent liberation of Western Poland. TheProvisional Government which is now functioning in Poland should, there-fore, be reorganised on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from Poles abroad. This new government should then be called the Polish Provisional Government ofNational Unity.M. Molotov, Mr. Harriman and Sir A. Clark Kerr should be authorisedto consult in the first instance in Moscow with members of the presentProvisional Government and with other Polish democratic leaders fromv/ithin Poland and from abroad, with a view to the reorganisation of thepresent Government along the above lines. This Provisional Governmentof National Unity would be pledged to the holding of free and unfetteredelections as soon as practicable on the basis of universal suffrage and secretballot. In these elections all democratic and anti-Nazi parties would havethe right to take part and put forward candidates.When a Polish Provisional Government of National Unity has been properly formed in conformity with the above, the three governments will accord it recognition.&quot;M. MOLOTOV proposed, and it was agreed that the words &quot; fully repre- -sentative &quot; in the first paragraph should be omitted.
M. MOLOTOV also proposed that the third paragraph should be amended to read as follows : - .&quot;When a Polish Provisional Government of National Unity has beenpronerly formed in conformity with the above, the Government of the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics, which now maintains diplomatic relationswith the present Provisional Government of Poland, and the Governmentof the United Kingdom and the Government of the United States of Americawill establish diplomatic relations with the new Polish Provisional Govern-ment of National Unity, and will exchange Ambassadors by whose reportsthe respective Governments will be kept informed about the situation in poland.&quot;This was agreed to,THE PRIME MINISTER said that this document made no reference tofrontiers, and that the world would at once ask what agreement had been reachedabout them. They were all agreed in principle about the Western frontier, andthe only question was where exactly the line should be drawn and how muchshould be said about it. It was agreed that the Poles should have part of east prussia and be free to go up to the line of the Oder if they so wished. HisMajesty&apos;s Government were, however, very doubtful indeed about their goingany further or about saying anything on the question at this stage. They had hada telegram from the War Cabinet strongly deprecating any reference to a frontieras far west as the Western Neisse, because the problem of moving the populationwas bigger than could be managed.THE PRESIDENT said that he would prefer to hear the views of the newPolish Government of National Unity, and suggested that all reference to theWestern frontier should be omitted at this stage.MARSHAL STALIN said that the Eastern frontier should certainly be mentioned.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that it was most important to state theposition on the Eastern frontier on which they were all agreed. There would bemuch criticism, but he would have to state frankly what the British position was.&amp;As regards the Western frontier, he agreed that the wishes of. the new PolishGovernment should first be ascertained, and that the frontier itself should bedetermined as part of the Peace settlements.THE PRESIDENT said that it would be easier for him if neither frontierwere mentioned, as he had no right to agree on questions of that kind which were really a matter for the Senate. ;M. MOLOTOV said that it would be useful if something could be said aboutagreement having been reached between the three Heads of Government on theEastern frontier, as it would clarify this important question. He thought thatthe Curzon Line should be mentioned as having been agreed to by all of them.There might be criticism for a time, but all the same it would be useful to mentionit. Perhaps they could accept some such formula now and leave it to the threeForeign Secretaries to find the necessary wording. He did not think it wasnecessary to define the Western frontier at this stage.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested something on. the following lines : &quot;It is recognised by the three Heads of Government that Poland shouldreceive substantial acquisitions of territory to the north and west. Theopinion of the new Polish Government should be sought on this question andthe final line should be determined at the Peace Settlement.&quot;After some discussion on other matters, it was agreed that the following paragraph should be added to the statement on Poland :-- &quot;The three Heads of Government consider that the Eastern frontier ofPoland should follow the Curzon Line with digressions from it in someregions of 5 to 8 kilometres in favour of Poland. They recognise that poland must receive substantial accessions of territory in the north and westThey feel that the opinion of the new Polish Provisional Government ofNational Unity should be sought in due course on the extent of these acces-sions, and that the final delimitation of the Western frontier of poland should thereafter await the Peace Conference.&quot;f29177]
2. Reparation.Mr. EDEN said that the British Delegation had set out their views onthe Soviet proposals in the document which he had handed in at the foreign secretaries&apos; Meeting that morning (Annex I to F.S.M. 9th Meeting). Thesedrafts had so far not been agreed. .THE PRIME MINISTER said that they had been instructed by their government not to mention figures, but to leave it to the Commission to ascertain the figures and the methods of reaching them.THE PRESIDENT said that no mention should be made of money, and thatit should be made clear that the reparations were in.kind.MARSHAL STALIN said that the objection to mentioning figures was lestpeople should think that the reparation was to be made in cash, but three countries, Finland, Hungary and Roumania, had signed armistices with Russia.In these armistices terms had been specified in figures. No misunderstandinghad arisen in these cases so why should it now&apos;? 20 billion dollars meant goods and reparations in kind to the value of 20 billion dollars. Perhaps the conference would prefer that the Russians should have no reparations at all. If so, they had better say so.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested &quot;that the Moscow Commission shouldbe authorised to issue interim reports and not to have to work out the whole problem before anything was allowed to be taken from the Germans. For instance,there might be some fixed plant that could be removed immediately.MARSHAL STALIN said that he wanted to speak frankly. Were they agreed that goods should be taken from Germany to make good the losses that hadbeen inflicted ?THE PRIME MINISTER said that they were.MARSHAL STALIN said that if it was agreed that goods should be takenin reparation, it should also be stated that this principle in regard to reparations was accepted.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the principle was accepted.MARSHAL STALIN said that it seemed to him that nothing definite had,,yet been settled. He proposed that the three Heads of Government should acceptthe simple principle that Germany must make reparation in kind for lossescaused by her to the Allied Nations; and also that they should ask the ReparationCommission to ascertain the amount of reparation which should be paid, and toreport to the three Governments.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he entirely agreed.MARSHAL STALIN said that the United States for their part agreedthat 20 billion dollars should be taken as the basis for discussion of the amount of reparations to be exacted from Germany.THE PRESIDENT said that he agreed with this. He went on to say thatthe United States was fully prepared to agree to the principles that marshal stalin had mentioned. He was, however, concerned with the words in which theprinciple was expressed.MARSHAL STALIN suggested that the Powers should speak of compensa-tion in kind for losses.THE PRIME MINISTER accepted this form; of words.The Prime Minister said that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not commit themselves to a figure of 20 billion dollars, or to any other figure until the problemhad been examined.MARSHAL STALIN said that they would not be committed to anyparticular figure. The proposal was that the Soviet formula should be taken fordiscussion, and that the Commission should modify or change the figures as they found necessary. He asked that the Commission should take as material forconsideration the formula agreed between the Americans and the Russians on theprevious day.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that that proposal should be made tothe Commission when it met.   He said that he had received a telegram from his
Government, which represented all parties in Great Britain, and read thefollowing extract: &quot; We consider it quite inadmissible to state any figure for Germandeliveries until the possibilities have been properly investigated on the spot.We consider 20 billion dollars (equals  500 million pounds a year) as far too great. It is roughly the equivalent of Germany&apos;s pre-war gross exports(i.e., not allowing for any imports) in an average year. It is not to be thoughtthat this should be paid by a Germany which &quot;has been bombed, defeated,perhaps dismembered and unable to pay for imports. True, some of it willbe her capital assets, but that will make it so much the harder for her to pay the rest. We also attach particular importance to some mentionbeing made of payments for German imports. Unless this has a priorityat least equal to that of reparation, we shall find ourselves paying for theimports necessary to keep Germany alive while others obtain the reparation.&quot;That was a very severe telegram.MARSHAL STALIN said that he did not go into the merits, and on theassumption that the expert who had written this telegram was correct, a smallersum could be fixed. He did not consider his figure as sacrosanct. His proposal was npt that it should be accepted, but that it should be discussed.THE PRESIDENT suggested that the whole matter should be referredto the Commission in Moscow.M. MOLOTOV said that only yesterday Mr. Stettinius had announced theresults of the consideration by the three Foreign Secretaries of this question andhad reported that agreement had been reached on the question of which countries should receive reparations and the types of reparations in kind which germany should pay. It was only on the third point, namely, where figures were mentionedon the basis of which the Commission should work, that a difference of opinionhad arisen. The American delegation had agreed to it and Mr. Eden had reservedhis opinion until he received instructions from London.Mr. EDEN said that his difficulty was that putting figures in the documentmight be regarded in some way as committing them. He would, however, be pre-pared to say &quot;the Moscow Reparations Commission will be instructed toexamine the report which M. Maisky had made on behalf of the Soviet Govern-ment to the Crimea Conference.&quot;--. -M. MOLOTOV said that this suggestion ignored the fact that the matter hadalready been discussed at the Crimea Conference.MARSHAL STALIN again asked whether it was agreed that Germany mustpay compensation in kind for losses caused by her to the Allied Nations duringthe war; and, secondly, whether the Moscow Commission should be given the task of considering the amount of reparations to be paid. That was ail that he wanted to get settled now. When the Commission met the Russians would bring in theirfigure and the other parties would bring in theirs.THE PRIME MINISTER and THE PRESIDENT agreed.3. Declaration on Liberated Europe,Mr. EDEN reported that M. Molotov had withdrawn a Russian amendmentabout support for those who had actively combated the enemy in liberated areas.M. Molotov had, however, proposed that the second part of paragraph 5 shouldbe amended to read : &apos;&apos; they will immediately consult together on the measures necessary to discharge the joint responsibilities set forth in this declaration.&quot;This amendment was accepted.Mr. EDEN then referred to the position of France in regard to thedeclaration. He would propose to add at the end of the declaration the following-words : &quot;In issuing this declaration, the three Great Powers express the hopethat the Provisional Government of the French Republic may be associated withthem in the procedure suggested.&quot; . -   &apos;This amendment was agreed to.
4. Zone of Occupation for the French and Control Commission for Germany.PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT said that at an earlier meeting he had opposed the French being made members of the Allied Control Commission for Germany.Having reflected on the matter, he had come to the conclusion that thePrime Minister was right in saying that if the French were given an area of occupied Germany to administer, they could not do so effectively unless they were members of the Control Commission. He thought that if the French were mademembers of the Control Commission they could do much less harm than if theywere not members and, moreover, that a concession on this point would make matters easier with the French in other respects.MARSHAL STALIN said that he was prepared to agree to the FrenchProvisional Government being invited to become a member of the Allied control commission for Germany.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought it was important that thisdecision should figure in the published report of the conclusions of the Conference.Mr. EDEN suggested that a telegram should be despatched forthwith, onbehalf of the three Great Powers, inviting the French Provisional Governmentto become a member of the Commission.MARSHAL STALIN agreed that this should be done.5. Yugoslavia.Mr.. EDEN said that it had been agreed that a message should be sent to marshal Tito and Dr. Subasic as suggested by Marshal Stalin on the previous day. It had also been agreed that a statement should be included in the final report of the Conference about their unity of view on the Yugoslav question.THE PRESIDENT asked whether the final communique, which would be signed by all three Heads of Governments, should include him as regardsYugoslavia, which was really an Anglo-Russian question.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the only point was approval ofthe Tito-Subasic Agreement, that it was very respectable, and that he hoped thatthe President would put his name to it.Mr. EDEN said that it had also been agreed that, as soon as a UnitedGovernment had been formed, they should advise Marshal Tito and Dr. Subasicto take steps to include certain members of the old Parliament in the newAssembly, and to make provision for the ratification of legislation passed by thenew Assembly.M. MOLOTOV said that it had been agreed that the telegram should bevery short, and should only deal with the necessity for putting the Tito-SubasicAgreement into force immediately. Such a telegram could be sent at once. later on, when the United Government had been formed, a telegram could be sentdealing with the other matters mentioned by Mr. Eden.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he hoped the public report on theConference would refer to both points. The world in general and the british public would form their judgment when they read the communique, and it wouldreconcile them to out-and-out recognition of the new Government if the other points were mentioned also, and would secure a better reception for the results ofthe Conference.M. MOLOTOV said that it would be inconvenient to publish anything inthe communique which had not also been said in the telegram.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that that was precisely the reason which made it difficult for him to accept the short telegram only. There was a verycomplex public opinion in Great Britain and he was anxious that the greatest possible acclamation should greet the report of the Conference; the inclusionof the points mentioned by Mr. Eden would help in every way.Mr. EDEN suggested that they should say &quot; It was further agreed that,when the Tito-Subasic Agreement had come into force, the three governments should recommend to the Yugoslav Government that it should make a declaration &quot;along the lines of paragraph 3 of Annex VI to F.S.M. (Argonaut) 7th Meeting
MARSHAL STALIN suggested that the third point, i.e., the suggestedstatement to the effect that the Government was only temporary pending free expression of the will of the people, should be omitted, as it was rather offensive to the new Government.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.MARSHAL STALIN suggested that the draft telegram should be modified,and should consist of three points : first, a recommendation that the Tito-SubasicAgreement should be put into effect immediately; secondly, that Avnoj should beextended to include members of the last Yugoslav Parliament who had notcompromised themselves by collaboration with the enemy; and, thirdly, that legis-lative acts passed by Avnoj should be subject to subsequent ratification by a constituent Assembly.This was agreed to; and it was also agreed that this statement should beincluded in the communique.The text of the telegram is given in the Annex.6. World Organisation.Mr. EDEN said that the three Foreign Secretaries had been asked to reporton the method of consultation with France and China about the decisions taken at the present Conference concerning World Organisation.They thought that the United States, on behalf of the Three Powers, should consult the Government of China and the French Provisional Government.The Foreign Ministers had also been asked to report on the text of the invita-tion to be issued to all the Nations which will take part in the United nations conference. The Foreign Ministers had prepared a form of invitation and had suggested that it should be included in the formal record of the conclusions of theConference.These proposals were accepted.7. Montreux Convention.MARSHAL STALIN said he wanted to say a few words about the MontreuxConvention. This Convention was now out of date. Japan played a moreimportant part under the Convention than the Soviet Union. Moreover, theConvention was linked up with the League of Nations.According to the Convention, Turkey had the right to close the Straitsnot only in case of war but if she considered that a threat of war existed. Itwas difficult to take the Convention seriously from the modern point of view.At the time that the Montreux Convention had been concluded, Russianrelations with Great Britain had not been very friendly. But at the present time he was sure that Great Britain would not wish to strangle Russia with the help of Japan, and he thought that the time had come when the Treaty should be modified, and Russian interests taken into account. It was impossible to put up with a situation in which a small State like Turkey could keep a hand onthe throat of a large country like Russia. He was willing that the question should be referred to some body for consideration. The next meeting of&quot; thethree Foreign Secretaries would take place in two or three months, and perhapsit would be possible for the matter to be discussed at their first meeting, and areport made by them to their Governments. That would prepare the stage for asettlement of this matter. &apos;PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT said that he looked upon this matter as one who came from 3,000 miles away. He observed that it was remarkable ^that the boundary between Canada and the United States, which was 3,000 miles long,was entirely undefended and had been so for 100 years; it would be wonderfulif this example could be followed elsewhere.THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. Stalin had mentioned this matter to Mr. Eden and himself when they had last been in Moscow. They had saidthat they viewed with sympathy the Marshall proposal that the convention should be revised or reconstructed, and they had suggested that the SovietGovernment should give them a note of their ideas on the subject. This,however, had not yet been done. He agreed, however,&apos; that the method of examination &quot;proposed by Marshal Stalin was wise. Great Britain certainly feltthat the present position of Russia in regard to her Black Sea interests and her
dependence upon the narrow entrance to the Black Sea through the Straits was an unsatisfactory one. If, therefore, the matter could be discussed at the next meeting of the three Foreign Secretaries, he hoped that Russia would then bring-forward proposals. It would be necessary that something should be said to turkey before this matter was brought up for consideration. Some timepreviously we had given an undertaking to Turkey that we would tell them before any matter was raised which affected their interests. The Foreign Secretary had just reminded him that, after their return from the Moscow Conference, he (theForeign Secretary) had mentioned the matter in very general terms to the turkish ambassador in London.The Prime Minister added that if, at the time when it was proposed to make changes in the Convention, some undertaking could be given to Turkey which made it clear that her independence and integrity were in no way affected, thiswould make it easier for her and for everybody else.MARSHAL STALIN said that it should be possible to give an assurance of this kind to Turkey. ^Jle said that he assumed that the three foreign secretaries would deal with the matter at their meeting in the United States atthe end of April.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this question affected British and mediterranean interests, and he thought  hat it would be preferable that thematter should be dealt with in London.THE CONFERENCE agreed that at the next meeting of the three foreign secretaries to be held in London the Foreign Secretaries should consider proposalswhich it was understood the Soviet Government would put forward in relationto the Montreux Convention, and report to their Governments. The TurkishGovernment would be informed at an appropriate moment.8. Report of the Conference.THE PRESIDENT said that he would have to leave at 3 p.m. on thefollowing day.After a short discussion it was agreed that a meeting of officials should beheld after dinner that evening, to prepare a draft report of the Conference; andthat the draft should be considered at a Plenary Meeting to be held on thefollowing morning.ANNEX.AT plenary session of Crimean Conference on 10th February the headsof the three Governments discussed the Yugoslavian question and agreed torecommend to Marshal Tito and to Dr. Subasic (a) That the Tito-Subasic agreement should immediately be put into effect and a new government formed on the basis of the agreement.(b) That as soon as the new government has been formed it should declare (i) that Avnoj will be extended to include members of the lastYugoslav Skupshtina who have not compromised themselves bycollaboration with the enemy, thus forming a body to be knownas a temporary Parliament and,(ii) that legislative acts passed by Avnoj will be subject to subsequentratification by a constituent assembly.

Bridges.Mr. Dixon.Mr. Jebb.Mr. Harrison. &apos;Mr. Wilson.Major Birse (Interpreter).communique on the Work of the Conference.The Conference considered the draft communique on their proceedings.Discussion proceeded mainly on the basis of a draft put forward jointly by theBritish and United States Delegations after an informal discussion on theprevious evening. .A number of drafting amendments were considered and dealt with. Thisrecord only deals with the major points.Introductory Sections&apos; It was agreed that this should be expanded and should include a list of thechief members of the Delegations.Section I. The Defeat of Germany.This was approved without amendment.Section II. Occupation and Control of Germany.It was agreed to add the following paragraph at the end of the first sentence ;. &quot; The limits of the French zone would be agreed by the Four Govern-ments concerned through their representatives on the European advisory commission.&quot; JSection III. Reparation by Germany.The Russian Delegates proposed to add a new section on this subjectThis was agreed to.Section IV.-United Nations Conference.The Russian Delegation objected to the following sentence in the paragraphdealing with voting procedure &quot; The present Conference has been able to resolve this difficulty by theadoption of proposals put forward by the United States.&quot;[29177] P
M. MOLOTOV pointed out that in no other part of the report was it statedthat a particular matter had been dealt with on the initiative of one of the Powersrepresented at the Conference. They thought that this sentence should be deleted,although they would have no objection to the American Government letting itbe known after the communique had been issued that the initiative in this matter had been theirs.It was agreed to delete the sentence in question.M. MOLOTOV also proposed that a reference should be included in thissection to the effect that the United Kingdom and United States of America had undertaken to support the proposal to admit to original membership of the world organisation the Ukraine and White Russia.THE PRESIDENT said that this proposal made difficulties for him.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he shared President Roosevelfsdifficulties. This matter affected the British Dominions and it had not beenpossible to consult them. He also added that three members of the british war Cabinet had objected to any infringement of the policy of one State onevote, but had agreed to submit to the decision of their colleagues as a whole.Furthermore, if the matter was now brought publicly before the world, it would bethe subject of controversy for a long time. It was quite clear that the UnitedStates of America and the United Kingdom had to support this proposal, andthis fact would be recorded in the protocol of the summary of conclusions. Inany event, it would be impossible for him to agree to include in the report any reference to this matter before consulting with the Dominions which might take some days.MARSHAL STiVLIN agreed not to press the amendment.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked him for this decision.Section V.-Declaration on Liberated Europe.This was agreed.Section VI. Poland.Objection was taken to the first sentence of the draft, which read asfollows : &apos;&quot;We were impressed by the dangers inherent in the failure of the majorallies to agree on the recognition of the Polish Government.&quot;This was deleted and the following sentence substituted :  &quot; We came to the Crimea Conference resolved to settle our differencesabout Poland.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was content with this section,although he would be strongly criticised for it at home on the grounds that wehad yielded completely to the Russian view.MARSHAL STALIN asked whether the Prime Minister agreed with thissection.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did, but he would certainly be strongly criticised.Section VII. :Yugoslavia.Section VIII. Meetings of Foreign Secretaries.These sections were approved without comment.Liberated Prisoners of War and Civilians.MARSHAL STALIN said that this matter had formed no part of theConference and he thought that it should not be included in their report. It wasagreed that this section should be published as a separate statement simul-taneously with the main report.
Signature of the Declaration of the Report.It was agreed that the report should be signed.   It was &quot;also agreed thatthe Heads of State should sign in alphabetical order.   It was agreed that thereshould be simultaneous publication at 21 - 30 hours British Summer Time on the&apos;12th February.Procedure for a Final Verification.It was agreed that the text should be collated by officials of the three governments and a report made to a meeting of the Foreign Secretaries later inthe afternoon, who would in turn report to the three Heads of Government.Note. At the meeting of Foreign Secretaries and Advisers, which was heldat 4 p.m., they had before them a revised text of a report from the threeofficials on the points on which final agreement had not been reached.The points raised at this meeting were almost entirely verbal, and have therefore not been recorded.The text of the communique as finally agreed is in Annex I.Immediately after the discussion of the joint communique had been concluded,the three Foreign Secretaries and their advisers, on behalf of the three Headsof Government, considered the protocol of the conclusions of the Conference.This discussion proceeded on the basis of a draft circulated by the british delegation.No points of special importance arose in this discussion.The text of the secret Protocol is in Annex II.ANNEX I.Report of the Crimea Conference.For the past eight days Winston S. Churchill, Prime Minister of GreatBritain, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, and marshal J. V.

The Defeat of Germany.We have considered and determined the military plans of the three AlliedPowers for the final defeat of the common enemy. The military staffs of the threeAllied nations have met in daily meetings throughout the Conference. these meetings have been most satisfactory from every point of view and have resultedin closer co-ordination of the military effort of the three Allies than ever before.The fullest information has been interchanged. The timing, scope andco-ordination of new and even more powerful blows to be launched by our armiesand air forces into the heart of Germany from the East, West, North and Southhave been fully agreed and planned in detail.Our combined military plans will be made known only as we execute them, butwe believe that the very close working partnership among the three staffs attainedat this Conference will result in shortening the war. Meetings of the three staffswill, be continued in the future whenever the need arises.Nazi Germany is doomed. The German people will only make the cost oftheir defeat heavier to themselves by attempting to continue a hopeless resistance.II. The Occupation and Control of Germany.We have agreed on common policies and plans for enforcing the uncon-ditional surrender terms which we shall impose together on Nazi Germany afterGerman armed resistance has been finally crushed. These terms will not be made known until the final defeat of Germany has been accomplished. Under the agreed plan, the forces of the Three Powers will each occupy a separate zone ofGermany.   Co-ordinated administration and control has been provided for under
the plan through a central Control Commission consisting of the SupremeCommanders of the Three Powers with headquarters in Berlin. It has beenagreed that Prance should be invited by the Three Powers, if she should so desire,to take over a zone of occupation, and to participate as a fourth member of theControl Commission. The limits of the French zone will be agreed by the four governments concerned through their representatives on the European advisory commission.It is our inflexible purpose to destroy German militarism and Nazism and toensure that Germany will never again be able to disturb the peace of the world.We are determined to disarm and disband all German armed forces; break up forall time the German General Staff that has repeatedly contrived the resurgence ofGerman militarism; remove or destroy all German military equipment; eliminateor control all German industry that could be used for military production; bringall war criminals to just and swift punishment and exact reparation in kind forthe destruction wrought by the German; wipe out the Nazi party, Nazi laws,organisations and institutions, remove all Nazi and militarist influences from public office and from the cultural and economic life of the German people; and take in harmony such other measures in Germany as may be necessary to thefuture peace and safety of the world. It is not our purpose to destroy the peopleof Germany, but only when Nazism and Militarism have been extirpated, willthere be hope for a decent life for Germans, and a place for them in the comity ofnations.III. Reparation by Germany.We have considered the question of the damage caused by Germany to theAllied Nations in this war and recognised it as just&apos;that Germany be obliged tomake compensation &quot;for this damage in kind to the greatest extent possible. ACommission for the Compensation of Damage will be established. The Commis-sion will be instructed to consider the question of the extent and methods for compensating damage caused by Germany to the Allied Countries. TheCommission will work in Moscow.IY.^United Nations Conference.We are resolved upon the earliest possible establishment with our Allies of ageneral international organisation to maintain peace and security. We believethat this is essential, both to prevent aggression and to remove the political,economic and social causes of war through the close and continuing collaboration of all peace-loving peoples.The foundations were laid at Dumbarton Oaks. On the important questionof voting procedure, however, agreement was not there reached. The present conference has been able to resolve this difficulty.We have agreed that a Conference of United Nations should be called tomeet at San Francisco in the United States on the 25th April, 1945, to prepare the charter of such an organisation, along the lines proposed in the informal conversations at Dumbarton Oaks.The Government of China and the Provisional Government of France willbe immediately consulted and invited to sponsor invitations to the Conferencejointly with the Governments of the United States, Great Britain and the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics. As soon as the consultation with China and france has been completed, the- text of the proposals on voting procedure will be made public.Y. -Declaration on Liberated Europe.We have drawn up and subscribed to a Declaration on liberated Europe.This Declaration provides for concerting the policies of the Three Powers andfor joint action by them in meeting the political and economic problems of liberated Europe in accordance with democratic principles. The text of theDeclaration is as follows : The Premier of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Prime Ministerof the United Kingdom, and the President of the United States of America have consulted with each other in the common interests of the peoples of their countries and those of liberated Europe.   They jointly declare their mutual agreement
to concert during the temporary period of instability in liberated Europe the policies of their three Governments in assisting the peoples liberated from the domination of Nazi Germany and the peoples of the former Axis satellite Statesof Europe to solve by democratic means their pressing political and economic problems .The establishment of order in Europe and the rebuilding of national economic life must be achieved by -processes which will enable the liberated peoples to destroy the last vestiges of Nazism and Fascism and to create democratic institu-tions of their own. choice. This is a principle of the Atlantic Charter-the rightof all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live the restoration of sovereign rights and self-government to those peoples whohave been forcibly deprived of them by the aggressor nations.To foster the conditions in which the liberated peoples may exercise thoserights, the three Governments will jointly assist the people in any Europeanliberated State or former Axis satellite State in Europe where in their judgmentconditions require (a) to establish conditions of internal peace; (&amp;) to carry outemergency measures for the relief of distressed peoples; (c) to ^ form interimgovernmental authorities broadly representative of ail democratic elements inthe population and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of Governments responsive to the will of the people; and (d) to facilitatewhere necessary the holding of such elections.The three Governments will consult the other United Nations and provisionalauthorities or other Governments in Europe when matters of direct interestto them are under consideration.When, in the opinion of the three Governments, conditions in any Europeanliberated State or any former Axis satellite State in Europe make such action necessary, they will immediately consult together on the measures necessary todischarge the joint responsibilities set forth in this declaration.By this declaration we reaffirm our faith in the principles of the atlantic charter^ our pledge in the declaration by the United Nations, and our deter-mination to build in co-operation with other peace-loving nations a world order under law, dedicated to peace, security, freedom and the general well-being ofall mankind.In issuing this declaration, the Three Powers express the hope that theProvisional Government of the French Republic may Be associated with themin the procedure suggested.YI.-Poland.We came to the Crimea Conference resolved to settle our differences aboutPoland. We discussed fully all aspects of the question. We reaffirm our common desire to see established a strong, free, independent and democraticPoland. As a result of our discussions we have agreed on the conditions in whicha new Polish Provisional Government of National Unity may be formed in sucha manner as to command recognition by the three major Powers.The agreement reached is as follows : A new situation has been created in Poland as a result of her completeliberation by the Red Army. This calls for the establishment of a PolishProvisional Government which can be more broadly based than was possible before the recent liberation of western Poland. The Provisional Governmentwhich is now functioning in Poland should therefore be reorganised on a broaderdemocratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from Poles abroad. This new Government should then be called the PolishProvisional Government of National Unity.M. Molotov, Mr. Harriman and Sir A. Clark Kerr are authorised as aCommission to consult in the first instance in Moscow with members of the presentProvisional Government and with other Polish democratic leaders from withinPoland and from abroad, with a view to the reorganisation of the present government along the above lines. This Polish Provisional Government ofNational Unity shall be pledged to the. holding of free and unfettered electionsas soon, as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot. In theseelections all democratic and anti-Nazi parties shall have the right to take part and to put forward candidates.When a Polish Provisional Government of National Unity has been properlyformed in conformity with the above, the Government of the Union of soviet socialist Republics, which now maintains diplomatic relations with the present
Provisional Government of Poland, and the Government of the United Kingdomand the Government of the United States will establish diplomatic relations withthe new Polish Government of National Unity, and will exchange Ambassadorsby whose reports the respective Governments will be kept informed about thesituation in Poland.The three Pleads of Government consider that the eastern frontier of poland should follow the Curzon Line with digressions from it in some regions of5 to 8 kilom. in favour of Poland. They recognise that Poland must receivesubstantial accessions of territory in the North and West. They feel that theopinion of the new Polish Provisional Government of National Unity should besought in due course on the extent of these accessions and that the finaldelimitation of the western frontier of Poland should thereafter await the PeaceConference.VII. Yugoslavia.We have agreed to recommend to Marshal Tito and Dr. Subasic that theAgreement between them should be put into effect immediately, and that a new government should be formed on the basis of that Agreement.We also recommend that as soon as the new Government has been formed itshould declare that -(i) The Anti-Fascist Assembly of National Liberation (Avnoj) should beextended to include members of the last Yugoslav Parliament(Skupshtina) who have not compromised themselves by collaboration with the enemy, thus forming a body to be known as a temporaryParliament; and(ii) Legislative Acts passed by the Assembly of National Liberation will besubject to subsequent ratification by a Constituent Assembly.There was also a general review of other Balkan questions.YIII. Meetings of Foreign Secretaries.Throughout the Conference, besides the daily meetings of the Heads of governments and the Foreign Secretaries, separate meetings of the three foreign secretaries, and their advisers, have also been held daily.These meetings have proved of the utmost value and the Conference agreedthat permanent machinery should be set up for regular consultation between thethree Foreign Secretaries. They will therefore meet as often as may be necessary,probably about every three or four months. These meetings will be held in rotation in the three capitals, the first meeting being held in London, after theUnited Nations Conference on World Organisation.IX. Unity for Peace as for War.Our meeting here in the Crimea has reaffirmed our common determination to maintain and strengthen in the peace to come that unity of purpose and ofaction which has made victory possible and certain for the United Nations in this war. We believe that this is a sacred obligation which our Governments owe toour peoples and to all the peoples of the world.Only with continuing and growing co-operation and understanding among our three countries, and among all the peace-loving nations, can the highestaspiration of humanity be realised a secure and lasting peace which will, in thewords of the Atlantic Charter, &quot; Afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want.&quot;Victory in this war and the establishment of the proposed international organisation will provide the greatest opportunity in all history to create in theyears to come the essential conditions of such a peace.(Signed) WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.J. V. STALIN.11th February, 1945. .
