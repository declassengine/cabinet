THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.Copy No.   f. i uVWAR CABINET.BRABAZON I  TYPE CIVIL AIRCRAFT:  PROPOSED EXTENSIONOF FILTON (BRISTOL) AIRFIELD.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT their meeting on the 8th December, 1943, the War Cabinet took note ofthe fact that authority had been given for the design and construction, at an estimated cost of  14 millions, of two proto-types of a large multi-engined civilland plane (the Brabazon I) conforming to requirements laid down by the brabazon Committee (W.P. (43) 167th Conclusions, Minute 2). An order for thetwo prototypes has since been placed by the Minister of Aircraft Production withthe Bristol Aeroplane Company.2. In a memorandum dated the 30th January (L.P. (45) 25) the Minister of aircraft Production drew the attention of the Lord Presidents Committee tothe fact that facilities would have to be provided for the final assembly and flight-testing of these two proto-types : a hard runway 2,750 yards long and 120 yardswide, with strengthened verges, would be required; and this would involve anextension of the Bristol Aeroplane Company&apos;s airfield at Filton. The minister was advised that neither the Defence Acts nor the Air Navigation Act, 1936.could be used for the acquisition of the land required for this purpose; and he accordingly sought the authority of the Lord Presidents Committee for.the pre-paration of a Government &quot; hybrid &quot; Bill for its compulsory acquisition.The Lord Presidents Committee considered the Ministers proposals at their meetings on the 2nd February and the 16th March, 1945 (L.P. (45) 6th Meeting,Minute 1, and L.P. (45) 15th Meeting, Minute 2). On the latter occasion theyhad before them certain further information contained in memoranda by theMinister of Civil Aviation (L.P. (45) 36) and by the Minister of Aircraft production-tion (L.P. (45) 57), as well as a memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (L.P. (45) 63).3. An estimate of the total amount of expenditure which must be incurredbefore the two proto-types can be produced and flown is given in the Annex to thismemorandum. It amounts not to  14; millions, which represents the cost of theair-frames alone, but to  4,565,250. The Minister of Aircraft Production haspointed out that it would not be right to attribute the whole of this expenditure to the two proto-types, or even to the Brabazon I as a type, since such expenditure is essential if ever we are to produce large-scale aircraft in the future; and theTreasury, who have examined the estimate, do not consider it excessive, havingregard to the work which has to be done. The Lord Presidents Committee have,however, thought it right that the War Cabinet should be informed that the project involves this very large additional expenditure, of which they had not previously been made aware.4. The approximate area of the land which it will be necessary to acquirefor the purpose of the runway strip is 180 acres, consisting in the main of goodaverage pasture and containing the village of Charlton, with 36 houses, 8 farms,a public house, shop and Methodist Hall, together with 17 acres of common land.The roads which would have to be closed include the Filton by-pass and a class IIroad together with a number of other by-roads, lanes and footpaths. Some ofthese assets would have to be replaced and the relevant expenditure is includedin the annexed estimate. Subject to such replacement, none of the Ministers[29527]SECRET.W.P. (45) 198.3rd April, 1945.(
concerned considers it necessary to oppose the project on the grounds of the loss &apos;of these assets.   Again, however, the Lord Presidents Committee feel that theWar Cabinet should be made aware of this new commitment.5. The Lord Presidents Committee understand that, whilst the Air staff are not yet in a position to express a definite opinion, they are inclined to the view-that very large bombers will be required in the future and that it should eventually be possible so to design them that they are self-protecting. The Committee alsounderstand that it is probable that very large civil aircraft will be required ifwe -are to be able to compete successfully on the trans-Atlantic route with theUnited States who are already constructing aircraft of this type. At this stagethese are still matters for speculation. It seems clear, however, that the presenttrend is towards very large aircraft, and that, if we are to maintain our positionin aircraft design and construction, we must enter this lield of development.The Lord Presidents Committee accordingly assume that the War Cabinet willnot wish to reconsider the decision that the two proto-types of the Brabazon I aircraft should be constructed.G. In that case there would appear to be no alternative to incurring the very substantial additional expenditure involved in providing the necessary facilitiesfor the final assembly and flight testing of the proto-types at Filton. TheLord Presidents Committee have considered whether, as an alternative, thecomponents might be transported for assembly and testing at some other airfield(e.g., Heath Row) which is, in any case, to be provided with a long runway. Theyare advised, however, that such a course would be quite impracticable. Thewings of these very large aircraft must be built in one or, at most, two sections,which are far too large and heavy to be transported by road. Moreover, asubstantial proportion of the design, drawing office and experimental resourcesof the contractors must be immediately available at the place of final assembly.7. For these reasons the Lord Presidents Committee consider that theproposal to extend the Filton airfield should be approved. At the same time, they feel bound to draw attention to the position which may arise if and when thesetwo&apos; proto-types prove successful and a decision is taken to proceed with theproduction of very large aircraft on. a considerable scale. There is clearly a danger that, if appropriate steps are not taken in advance, the Government maybe faced with the position either of having in effect granted to the bristol aeroplane Company a monopoly for the production of such aircraft or of being-obliged to incur expenditure on a similar scale in order to provide final assembly and flight-testing facilities for other aircraft manufacturers, with all that thiswould involve in the way of loss of agricultural land, &amp;c.8. For the reasons explained in paragraph 6 above, this danger cannot be avoided by arranging for the components of these ait craft to be transported fromthe factories for final assembly and flight-testing elsewhere. On the other hand,it is doubtful whether the country will be able to afford either the heavy expenditure or the considerable sacrifice of land which would be involved in theextension of the airfields of the four other contractors, besides the bristol aeroplane Company, in the heavy aircraft field. The concentration of factoriesmanufacturing very large aircraft round one airfield would clearly be out of thequestion on security grounds. If, however, they could be allocated between thethree or four airfields (including Filton), which are in any case to be provided with sufficiently long runways, a reasonable degree of dispersal might be combined with a reasonable degree of economy. The Lord Presidents Committeeaccordingly feel that this possibility shoidd be seriously considered.9. In the case of some of the contractors such a, policy might eventuallyinvolve the construction of entirely new factories solely for the production of the severy large aircraft, and in such cases it might eventually prove necessary for theGovernment to finance some of the expenditure involved. At least one contractoris, however, already seeking a new location; and if the policy proves to be practicable, it would seem advisable that they should all be warned without delaythat, if it were eventually decided that these very large types of aircraft should,be constructed, they could, hope to receive orders for them only if they established themselves in the neighbourhood of one of certain specified airfields.10. The immediate purpose of the proposed extension of the Filton airfieldis to provide flight-testing facilities for the two proto-type Brabazon I aircraft,if, however, the airfield were further extended by taking in another 700 acres of farm land with a maximum of 41 additional houses and 1 additional farm, it
would alsp be suitable for use by the Bristol Corporation as their civil airport.A further question for consideration, therefore, is whether the Filton airfieldshould be so used, under suitable financial arrangements between the Ministryof Civil Aviation, the Ministry of Aircraft Production, the Bristol corporation and the Bristol Aeroplane Company. The Airport Committee of the BristolCorporation have stated that they are in favour of such a scheme, subject to an assurance of an adequate subsidy and a guarantee against the licensing. of a potentially competitive airport. The Department of Civil Aviation have not,however, been able to give assurances on these points; and have suggested that theR.A.F. airfield at Lulsgate Bottom might be more suitable for the purpose of a civil airport.11. A decision that the Filton airfield should be further extended and used as the Bristol Civil Airport would result in a considerable saving of expenditure to the Government; and the Lord Presidents Committee consider that, from every point of view, it is desirable that the same airfield should, if possible, beused for the purposes of testing the two Brabazon I proto-types and for the bristol Civil Airport. They have not, however, had an opportunity to discussthe latest position with the Minister of Civil Aviation; and they accordingly recommend that this question should be reviewed as soon as possible after his return. At the same time they consider that no final arrangements should bemade with the Bristol Corporation as to the terms on which the Filton airfieldmight be used for the purposes of a civil airport, until the Government&apos;s policy inregard to the general question of the ownership and financing of civil airportshas been settled.12. The recommendations of the Lord Presidents Committee may besummarised as follows : (1) The proposal for the extension of the Filton airfield for the purposes oftesting the two Brabazon T proto-types should be approved, and theMinister of Aircraft Production should be authorised to promote a&quot;hybrid&quot; Bill for the acquisition of the land required for thispurpose.(2) Serious consideration should be given to the practicability of arranging for such very large aircraft as may eventually be required in additionto these two proto-types to be constructed in the immediate vicinityeither of the Filton airfield or of other airfields which are in any case to be provided with long runways.(3) Should this prove practicable, the four contractors in the heavy aircraftfield, other than the Bristol Aeroplane Company, should be warned that, if it is eventually decided that numbers of very large aircraft should be produced, they can hope to obtain orders for them only ifthey establish themselves in the neighbourhood of certain specifiedairfields.(4) The question whether the Filton airfield should subsequently be furtherextended for use as a civil airport and, if so, what financial arrange-ments should be made with the Bristol Corporation, should be further examined on the return of the Minister of Civil Aviation.C.
