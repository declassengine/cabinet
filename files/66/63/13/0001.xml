THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY GF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 158.12th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.FOOD SUPPLIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Food.SINCE W.P. (45) 109 and 130 were circulated our own food supply position has considerably deteriorated.2.   I had hoped to bridge the supply deficits by two methods : (a) by the United States reducing standards of consumption;(b) by reduction in our stocks down to such level&apos;! as left us safe workingmargins.There indeed seemed good prospect of this being brought about. But now theWar Food Administration seems to be set against making any cuts in UnitedStates consumption. &apos;(a) I have just received a cable from the British Food Mission that theWar Food Administrator has put to the Combined Food Board a recommendation that during the second quarter of this year no meat-should be supplied at allfrom the United States either for the United Kingdom or for any of the liberated Areas.If we were to accept this, we should have to reduce our carcase meat rationforthwith from Is. 2d. to 1.5. Od. (with similar reductions in hotels, restaurantsand canteens), and we ought at the same time to indicate that a further reductionin the meat ration is probably inevitable.We should have to taper off the issue of the canned meats we distribute underthe Points Scheme and discontinue them altogether by the middle of the year.We should have to cancel our recent offer to supply Russia with 25,000 tonsof canned corned beef.(b) If and when we have to make these cuts on our civilians I suggest thatwe should review the issues made to Prisoners of War. At present the ration scales for meat (including meat of all kinds and bacon) are :  Ounces a, Week.United Kingdom civilians and Prisoners of War in camps      34Italian Prisoners of War in working parties...       ...       ...       i9 37j German Prisoners of War in working parties        ...       ...       63I am aware that we are acting in accordance with the Geneva Convention.I doubt whether our own Prisoners of War are receiving such high scaleseither at the hands of the Germans or the Japanese. It seems absurd that ourworkers should get approximately half the meat a German gets while doing thesame or similar work. I suggest that a small sub-committee of the Departmentsconcerned might be set up to investigate this matter and make a report.4. Oils and Fats.According to a recent cable from the Food Mission a crisis is predicted this summer. Supplies in the United States which ought to have been procured for liberated areas seem to have disappeared. The United States officials are apparently unwilling &quot; to indulge in thoroughgoing procurement methods becauseof the impact on United States civilian supplies.&quot;    In spite of the hopes[29405]
originally held out when my paper was prepared the United States is apparentlyunwilling to eat less or wash less. A rationing scheme for soap in the UnitedStates would make a world of difference.5. Sugar.As pointed out in W.P. (45) 109 the gap between supply and requirements is 1,500,000 tons. We originally proposed to bridge this large gap partly byinroads into the United Kingdom stocks and partly by reductions in UnitedStates and Canadian consumption, which during the war has been much higherthan that of the United Kingdom. Negotiations in Washington on the subjecthave not so far led to a satisfactory agreement, as the United States authoritiesseem anxious to postpone decisions until May in the hope that something will turnup.   The situation is bad and should be faced at the earliest possible moment.6. Feeding Stuffs.At the end of last year the United States promised to make maize availableto us if we stopped buying in the Argentine market. After meeting only half ofour needs they are now saying that they cannot send us any more.With their consent I am now again endeavouring to obtain maize from theArgentine. Owing to the drought there and to their having burnt some as fuelwhen we were not buying it I may not be able to provide the feeding stuffs needed to implement our announced policy of building up our livestock population here.7. Service Supplies.Long debates have continued in Washington over quite small supplies of relatively unimportant foodstuffs for our own Services canned bacon, cannedchicken, desiccated yeast, dehydrated potatoes. The attitude of the War Depart-ment is that until their own insatiable demands have been met our own services must simply do without these foods.8. Conclusions.The Americans are pressing for a further joint enquiry into our stock levels.They are a drop in the ocean compared with current American consumption.Any such enquiry should be two-ways into United States consumption aswell as into our stocks. It may well be a choice between belt-tightening inAmerica or chaos in Europe.Already I have had to give up all my hopes of increased rations. It wouldbe tragedy if we have to celebrate the end of the war in Europe with a cut in ouralready meagre and dull standards of consumption.A direct appeal to the President seems to me the only course now open. he must be made to realise the present position, in the hope that he will then issue a Directive to his Administration. Only so will United States officials face theposition and take the necessary measures to ensure that the United States makesits full and proper contribution.J. J. LL.Ministry of Food, W. 1,12th March, 1945.7
