1.N iSIxii X    J-DRaFT TELEGRAM FROM THE DOMINIONS OFFICETO THE C.JIADI^N government we are very glad to know that the Canadian Government has considered our request for assistance, in the form of Mutual Aidor otherwise,  sufficient  to enable our requirements In Canadaduring the fiscal year 1945/46 to &quot;be met without our having to incur   debt to Canada during that period;    and that the canadian government is prepared to recommend to Parliament continuationfor the time being of provision for Mutual Aid on the scalerequested.8,      We warmly welcome this decision of the Canadian Government,which will assure the continuation of the wartime principle ofpooling of resources which has contributed so greatly to thecommon interests of the United Nations,3*      It will be remembered that during the discussions which lord K-eyne s and sir R.  Sinclair had with Canadian Ministers last november,   the general question was raised whether the existing system of Mutual Aid should he continued into 1945/46;    or whether some other system, e.g.  one of financial pooling, should besubstituted for it.    We should be glad to know what are the presentviews of the Canadian Government on this question.4,      We also greatly welcome the Canadian Government&apos;s declarationof its willingness to make interim arrangements, in the  event thatthe necessary Parliamentary approval is delayed;,  to ensure that the flow of essential supplies from Canada during the early part of thecoming fiscal year is not interrupted.    We assume that,  on thestrength of this decision, U,Ji.   supply departments can he authorisedto proceed with the placing of such orders in Canada as are currently necessary.    If any departure -were required from thegeneral lines of the programmes discussed with the Canadian Governmentlast autumn,  the consequential changes would be introduced only after prior consultation between our Supply Departments and D.M* S.5,      Apart from the foregoing questions of general principle, thereare certain particular questions outstanding which concern the -current financial arrangements &quot;between the two countries, e. g.   the arrange-ments regarding cancellation of contracts and those  for financingIndian orders for rolling stock.    It would be very helpful to us ifan early decision could be reached on these questions,6.     We suggest that all the questions referred to in this telegram which may be described as falling within the sphere of currentMutual Aid administration, can best be discussed in Ottawa, betweenthe appropriate Canadian Ministers and Departments on the one hand,and the U,K, High Commissioners and his staff on the other.    Weshould of course he ready to send out representatives as necessaryto assist in such discussions.7*      My immediately following telegram sets out our preliminaryviews in reply to the wider questions raised in your telegraffiaWos,  45 and 46.

.ALTNEX IIDPu.FT TLL^belgium FROM THb DOMINIONS OFFICETO  THE  Ci^i^DLul G-OVSRljMgNTYour telegrams Mos.  4b and 46,We are grateful to  the Canadian Government for their initiative in setting out so frankly the considerations which are causing themconcern about the future trend   of economic relations between canada and the sterling area, and in putting forward proposalsfor meeting the problems with which we shall be confronted atthe end of the war.    As your telegrams recognise, these important issues must be viewed not only against the hard facts of our ownexternal position, as it will emerge at the end of the war, butalso in the light of our future economic relations with the U.S.A.The whole problem has a political as well as an economic side.No easy solution can be looked for and, in the unprecedentedcircumstances which confront us, we can only feel our way graduallyas conditions permit in making plans for economic recovery both for ourselves and for the rest of the world,2.      We are pressing forward with the consideration of those matters as rapidly as the state of the war permits, but we canonly proceed by stages from the full application of the presentmeasures of war-time control to the long-term objective of freeingtrade from the restrictions which su**h controls involve.    these controls have been imposed as an unavoidable part of the concentre-tion of all available resources on the war effort, and so faras the trade between ourselves and Canada is concerned it is, wethink,  true to say that they have always been operated in full consultation and agreement with the Canadian Government.    Indeed,it has been our common aim during the currency of Mutual Aid toregulate the demands made upon Canada in such a way as to achieve the maximum economy in the use of the Canadian dollars which are thus made available to us.    We share the Canadian Government&apos;sanxiety that these war-time controls should not outlive the wartime necessities which gave rise to them, and we look forward toco-operating with Canada in establishing conditions which would permit of their removal as soon as possible,,    In the process etchange we shall do all that lies in our power to make these controlstolerable and free  from permanently harmful effects, both inday to day administrative working and in the gradual evolution of the principles underlying them,3.      We greatly welcome your suggestion for the opening of discussions between our two Governments as to the best method ofsuch co-operation.    The questions involved, vitally important asthey are to our two  countries, are of course part of much wider questions affecting the whole future of international economic relations, particularly with the U, So  and until further progress has been made in this field, we  shall be in some  difficulty incarrying discussions to a definitive stage.    But early discussions between us would be valuable,  and these, we suggest, might best be started on an informal and exploratory basis.    There would be great advantage if some of the Canadian officials chiefly concerned could visit London 1XX the near future for this purpose.    It hasoccurred to us that this might be combined with the forthcoming visit of Mr.   Hume Wrong to London for the talks preparatory to theoan Francisco.Conference,    We would warmly welcome  such an arrange-ment and we. should be glad to know whether this suggestion wouldcommend itself to your Government.

4,      If such a visit can be arranged, we  should, hope to take advantage of it, not only for an informalexchange of views as to the immediate problems between us, but to consider possible ways of removing by administrative action particular difficulties whichmay i arise!.    No less than the Canadian Government, weare anxious that future trade relations between our two countries shall not be prejudiced by the policiesadopted to meet war-time exigencies;    and even thoughit may not yet be possible to take the fundamentaldecisions which will determine the patt ern ox post-war trad?, mutual consultation should be very helpful in ensuring that those  decisions are not compromisedby what is currently taking place.
