THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 189.22nd March, 1945DOUBLE TAXATION DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES:PROVISIONS FOR EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION.-Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.MY -colleagues will recollect that in my memorandum W.P. (45) 1 of the1st January, 1945, I reported on the position reached in discussions which werein progress between representatives of the United Kingdom and United states government, with a view to conclusion of an agreement on double taxation. Thescope of the proposed agreement was fully summarised in that memorandum butI think that my colleagues may wish to consider specially, in view of the publicinterest in the matter, the proposed provisions relating to exchange of information.2. Any double taxation convention with the United States ranks as a treaty and has therefore to receive the approval of the United States Senate. TheUnited States Senate has made it quite clear in dealing with past Treaties thatit will not approve Double Taxation Treaties which do not provide for reciprocalassistance to deal with fraud and avoidance.3. The Heads of Agreement for the Treaty with the United States contain the following paragraph in regard to exchange of information : &quot; Exchange of Information.&quot; The United States and the United Kingdom agree that :&quot; The taxation authorities of the two countries will exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this agreementor for the prevention of fraud or avoidance, being information that is avail-able under their taxation laws. Any information so furnished will betreated as secret and will not be disclosed to any person other than those concerned in the assessment and collection of taxation and will not includeinformation that would disclose any trade secret or trade process.&quot;This paragraph was a United Kingdom draft drawn up after much discussion in which the United Kingdom representatives stressed the difficulty that might arise in the United Kingdom, especially in financial circles, in connexion withthe giving of information. The formula does not commit either Government tosupply automatically any information that might be demanded by the other. Itis understood between us and the Americans that each side is the judge of whatis necessary.4. The draft Treaty is now almost ready for final approval and contains the following Article in respect of Exchange of Information : &apos;&quot; Article XX.&quot; (1) The taxation authorities of the Contracting States shall exchangesuch information (being information available under the respective taxationlaws of the Contracting States) as is necessary for carrying out theprovisions of the present Convention or for the prevention of fraud or theadministration of statutory provisions against legal avoidance in relation tothe taxes which are the subject of the present Convention. Any informationso exchanged shall be treated as secret and shall not be disclosed to any[29493]Copy No.WAR CABINET.
person other than those concerned with the assessment and collection of the taxes which are the subject of the present Convention. No information shallbe exchanged which would disclose any trade secret or trade process.&quot; (2) As used in this Article, the term &apos; taxation authorities &apos; means,in the case of the United States, the Commissioner of -Internal Revenue or his authorised representative; in the case of the United Kingdom, theCommissioners of Inland Revenue or their authorised representative; and,&apos; in the case of any territory to which the present Convention is extendedunder Article XXII, the competent authority for the administration in suchterritory of the taxes to which the present Convention applies.&quot;5. The provisions of the Treaty cannot of course be worked withoutexchange of information, for the reliefs from taxation which are to be given by either country under the&apos; Treaty are generally conditional upon the taxpayerbeing resident and liable to tax in the other country and this fact must be vouchedfor by the taxation authority of the latter country. For example, the dividends,interest and royalties payable from United States to a person resident in theUnited Kingdom and liable to the United Kingdom tax qualify for relief, but thedividends, interest and royalties paid to the British nominee of a Dutchman ora Frenchman do not qualify for the relief. In the case of trading concerns inone country operating in the other country through branches or subsidiary com-panies the Treaty provides for the computation of the profits of the branch&apos; orsubsidiary on an &quot; arms length &quot; basis, and to carry out this it may be necessaryto exchange information in particular cases (to verify, for example, that goods are invoiced at reasonable prices). Industry, which has been sounded, is not likely to object to exchange of information for that purpose. As stated inparagraph 14 of W.P. (45) (1) the exchange of information may also extend to cases of avoidance of taxation where individuals in one country enter intoartificial transactions designed to reduce their tax liability.6. -It will be evident from my earlier memorandum W.P. (45) 1 that theproposed Treaty secures important advantages for this country. These are more fully set out in the earlier memorandum, but the salient points are as follows : (a) The Treaty secures as from January 1945 the lower withholding rate of15 per cent, instead of the normal rate of 30 per cent, on United Statesdividends and rents coming to the United Kingdom and the (reciprocal)exemption from United States tax of interest, industrial royalties,literary royalties and film royalties coming to the United Kingdom.(b) It provides for the reciprocal exemption of air transport profits.(c) It provides lor reciprocal exemption of agency profits where a concernin one country operates through an agent in another country who hasno power to negotiate contracts except at a fixed price.(d) It provides that British concerns not engaged in business in the UnitedStates will not be liable to any Capital Gains tax; there was greattrouble in this connexion some years ago when the United StatesRevenue Authorities sought to charge British financial concerns to capital Gains tax in respect of the gain arising on sales of UnitedStates securities, and eventually the United States had to amend itslaw; the Treaty insures against any further change of United Stateslaw that might be in the direction of resurrecting such a charge.(e) It provides that all sales by British concerns through broker or commis-sion agents in the United States will be exempt from United Statestax which is already the law in this country in the converse case;on this front also there was considerable trouble some years ago whenthe United States Revenue Authorities sought to charge producemarket transactions (e.g., cotton) carried out in the United States byBritish concerns and the United States amended its law : a provision in the treaty makes the exemption wider than the present UnitedStates law and makes this wider exemption permanent.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,22nd March, 1945.
