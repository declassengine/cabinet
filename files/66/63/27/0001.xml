THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-- - ----------- r-- ---- tPrinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1945.SECRET. I Copy NoW.P. (45) 172,17*A March, 1945.WAR CABINET.FRENCH ZONE OF OCCUPATION IN GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT was agreed at the Crimea Conference that the European advisory commission should settle the boundaries of the French zone of occupation inGermany.2. The French Provisional Government have proposed that their zone should consist of all German territory west of the Rhine up to Cologne inclusive;Hessen-Darmstadt; Hessen-Nassau; and Baden (see blue line on annexed map).The territory west of the Rhine lies in the British zone as at present agreed.3. I see the strongest objection to bringing the French zone as far north asCologne. This city is the natural centre of the vital Ruhr-Rhine area. We shallbe in control of the Ruhr basin and it seems to me essential that we should alsocontrol the districts of Cologne and Aachen, which are complementary to the ruhr politically, administratively and economically. If the French are estab-lished in control at Cologne there is a danger that they might mismanage affairs or pursue a divergent policy in the Rhineland as they did after the last war. Anyresulting disorders would have repercussions throughout the Rhine-Ruhr area,the greater part of which would remain within the British zone.4. Moreover, the French proposal would give the French control over thewhole area masking the Belgian frontier on the East, and may well indicateFrench intentions to secure the use of Belgian forces inside their zone. Thiswould be contrary to our policy, which has always contemplated that a Belgiancontingent would be available to help in the occupation of the British zone. Thiswas one of the main reasons for our offer to the Belgian Government (which theyhave accepted) of British assistance in equipping and training three Belgian Army divisions in the first period after the defeat of Germany. To forestall any risk of the Belgians committing themselves to the French I recently instructedHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels to ask the Belgian Minister for ForeignAffairs to confirm that his Government would make available a Belgian contingentfor the British zone. M. Spaak has now replied that he wishes the Belgiancontingent to be available for the British zone and hopes it may be employed insome area adjoining Belgian territory.5. I do not overlook the importance of man-power. The Chiefs of staff have been counting upon three French &apos;&apos; occupational divisions &apos;&apos; (approximately20,000 men each) to help in manning the British zone. This is approximately theestimated garrison for the area of the present British zone, south from Cologne,which the French are claiming. If, for the reasons given above, we reject thefull French demand in favour of the zone suggested in paragraph 6 (i) below(see hatched area on the annexed map), at least one additional &quot;occupationaldivision &apos;&apos; will have to be found for the British zone. It is, however, now clearthat we shall be able to recoup ourselves by securing a Belgian &apos;&apos; occupationaldivision.&quot;12710   [29441]
6.   The conclusions which I recommend to my colleagues are thereforeas follows :  (i) The French zone should include all territory in the present British zoneon both banks of the Rhine up to the northern boundary of theadministrative districts of Treves and Coblenz (see hatched area onannexed map).(ii) We should firmly resist the French desire to carry their zone any furthernorthwards.(iii) The city of Cologne itself must be occupied by British troops.(iv) We should now definitely plan on the basis that at least one Belgianoccupational division will be available for the British zone, and shouldtake note that the Belgian Government hope that it may be employedin some area adjoining Belgian territory.(v) The extent to which the French zone on the East bank of the Rhine iscarved out of the existing United States zone is a matter primarily for agreement between the French and the iVmericans.(vi) It is probable that the Americans will take exception to the whole ofFfessen-Nassau being transferred to the French, as this would entailtheir Lines of Communication passing through the French as well asthe British zone. If this point is put forward by the Americans weshould support them.7. If my colleagues agree with these conclusions, I would propose to instruct the United Kingdom Representative on the European Advisory Commissionaccordingly.8. This paper has been written in consultation with the Chiefs of Staff andhas their concurrence.A. E.Foreign Office, 17th March, 1945.
