THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 170.19th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.CANADIAN POLITICAL AFFAIRS-THE  GREY NORTH   .BY-ELECTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I annex, for the information of the War Cabinet, a despatch from the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner at Ottawa reporting on the by-election at GreyNorth, Ontario, at which General McNaughton, the Government candidate andnew Minister for National Defence, was defeated by the Progressive Conservativecandidate. The dominant issue at the by-election was the Canadian Governmentsman-power policy with special reference to the recent crisis over reinforcements for the Canadian Army, accounts of which I circulated to the Cabinet in w.P. (44) 719 and W.P. (45) 7.C.Dominions Office,19th March, 1945.Copy No.ANNEX.Of/ice of the High Commissionerfor the United Kingdom,(No. 82.) Earnscliffe, Ottawa.My Lord, 15^ Febrxiary, 1945.WITH reference to my telegram No. 248 of the 6th February, I have the honour to confirm that the final figures in the Grey North by-election held on the5th February were as follows : W. Garfield Case (Progressive Conservative)        ...      7,338General A. G. L. McNaughton (Liberal)      ......      6,099Air Vice-Marshal A. E. Godfrey (C.C.F.)   ......      3,1362. As will be seen, the Governments man-power policy was the dominantissue at the election and some account of recent developments in the situation as regards the army may, therefore, not be out of place.3. It will be recalled that at the recent session in Parliament general mcnaughton had announced that, over and above the normal planned flow of reinforcements, 5,000 extra reinforcements were required to sail in December,5,000 in January and 6,000 spread over February and the succeeding two months.As volunteers were not thought likely to come forward in sufficient numbers, anOrder-in-Council was passed providing for compulsory service overseas by homedefence troops, limited to a total of 16,000 in the first instance. In accordancewith this policy, reinforcements have been sent forward to Europe; but reportsof absenteeism among N.R.M.A. personnel have recently given a new andsensational twist to the general attack on the Governments man-power policy.4.   It had been widely known shortly after Christmas that, at various campsthroughout Canada, N.R.M.A. personnel, who had been granted leave beforesailing for overseas, had failed to report for duty; but the censorship authorities[29440] w b
banned any reference to these disturbances on security grounds until the convoyconcerned had safely arrived in Britain. On the 21st January, however, theToronto Globe and Mail (which has been the Governments foremost critic on man-power) &quot; jumped the gun &quot; and appeared to have forced a statement fromthe Department of National Defence. As a matter of fact, General McNaughtonhad told me several days earlier that he was going to make an official and full statement of the position shortly afterwards, and this statement appeared on thedate he had foreshadowed to me, which happened to be the day following theToronto j)aper&apos;s &quot;leakage.&quot; It announced the completion of troop movementswhich had resulted in the arrival in the United Kingdom of more than 8,300N.R.M.A. troops. But General McNaughton also reported a high percentage ofabsenteeism and revealed that, of 15,600 N.R.M.A. men warned for overseas service, 7,800 were at one time absent without leave and that at the time of his statement approximately 6,300 were still unreported for various reasons. Hehad told me privately that he had expected 50 per cent, absenteeism, and so had called up twice the number of men he needed. He added that action towardsapprehension of those still absent was continuing and threatened that any menwho remained absent for more than 21 days would be posted as deserters and thatdisciplinary action would be taken. According to the latest announcement madeon the 1st February, the number of absentees has now been reduced to 4,600. no statement has yet been made as to the disciplinary action being taken.In a speech delivered during his by-election campaign, General McNaughtonrevealed that the military authorities had advised that, if it was planned to get8,000 N.R.M.A. troops overseas, 15,000, 16,000 or 17.000 should be warned for service because 6,000 or 7,000 were likely to go absent without leave. GeneralMcNaughtqn confessed that he had a feeling that a high proportion of the Home&apos;Defence Army were &quot; neither good to God or man.&quot; He hoped that the troops now overseas had &quot; come round to the right frame of mind &quot; and added : &quot; Theyare in for a pretty thin time at the hands of the army overseas if they don&apos;t do their duty.&quot; Ruefully commenting on the behaviour of the Home Defence Army,he said : &quot;.they are not the type of people we need be very proud of in this countryand we don&apos;t need to worry about showing them any sympathy or mercy.&quot;5. This considerable absenteeism should represent a humiliation for canada and it has brought into high relief the spirit prevailing in the Home DefenceArmy. Two points may be observed. Deplorable as the incidents have been, theyresult almost inevitably from the division of Canacla&apos;s forces into the two armiesand from the constant process of &quot; persuading &quot; the best material to volunteerfor overseas service, leaving only the less reliable elements. Moreover, they havebeen badly officered, vilified by certain organs of the press and alternativelybullied and cajoled by the Government. The second point of interest, particu-larly in view of the racial division which was shown in the debate in Parliament,is the fact that the troubles were by no means confined to French-speaking troops.Disturbances occurred also among English-speaking troops in camps in BritishColumbia, the Prairies and Ontario. The defaulting has been regarded as amatter affecting Canada as a whole and no attempt has been made to stir upracial animosity; indeed Quebec has, if anything, been comforted by the know-ledge that she is not the only black sheep in the fold.6. It was in this unpalatable atmosphere that the Minister for NationalDefence sought to enter Parliament through the vacancy created by the retire-ment of the sitting Liberal member in the constituency of Grey North in Ontario.The by-election was contested in the full glare of publicity and in a spirit of mounting bitterness, prejudice and violence that bad been absent from more recent Canadian politics. The leaders of the three parties all intervened in astruggle which had moments both of high drama and of sordid pettiness.7. The Prime Minister early intervened in the campaign and lectured the constituency in a series of pontifical and lengthy written appeals. In a state-ment issued on the 16th January he announced that, before deciding on the time at which the next session of Parliament would be held, the Government would&quot;await developments&quot; in the by-election campaign. In a long message issued on the 23rd January, assuming an attitude of righteous wrath, Mr. mackenzie king disingenuously declared that the Government had every right to expect thatthe by-election would not be contested. He urged the importance of ensuring a seat in Parliament for the new Minister of National Defence, and charged theOpposition parties with &quot; sowing prejudices and poisons and stirring up party political controversies on all kinds of questions.&quot;  He complained that the contest
4 *1 31 mwas making it increasingly difficult for the Government to give undivided atten-tion to the prosecution of the war and threatened that the Opposition parties were creating and fostering the very circumstances which would make a generalelection inevitable. This statement was generally interpreted as preparing theway for calling an early general election, and it was widely assumed that thePrime Minister, rather than risk the possibility of defeat for general mcnaughton, would seek a dissolution of Parliament before a by-election couldbe held. In the event other counsels prevailed, and it may well be that general mcnaughton himself objected to a course which could only be humiliating for him personally. When the nomination of the Opposition candidates was announced on the 29th January, the Prime Minister merely declared that a generalelection would be &quot;called&quot; before the 17th April (the day on which the life ofthe present Parliament expires). He repeated his denunciation of the opposition parties whose action was &quot; unwarranted and unworthy &quot; and appealed to theelectors to view the issue solely in the light of what was best for Canada&apos;s armyoverseas and to support General McNaughton.8. The candidates opposing General McNaughton were Mr. Case (Progres-sive Conservative) and Air Vice-Marshal A. E. Godfrey (C.C.F.). Both were for different reasons strong candidates. Mr. Case is a former mayor of OwenSound, the main town in the constituency, and was reputed to be popular locally.Air Vice-Marshal Godfrey has a distinguished record as an airman in both wars.One curious feature about the candidates was frequently commented on. the progressive Conservative was a former Liberal and had, indeed, contested thelast election in Grey North as an Independent Liberal. The Liberal candidatewas by profession a soldier whose sympathies had always been thought to lie with the&apos; Conservative party. The C.C.F. candidate was a high ranking officer who was the capitalist owner of a flourishing industrial concern. One incidentwas thought at one time to have marred Mr. Case&apos;s chances. This was thepublication of a private letter Avhich he had written as recently as last Octobersaying that he was definitely opposed to overseas conscription, but relatively littlenotice was taken of it. - -9. Nominations were received on the 29th January, and the election washeld on the 5th February. The campaign wa.s therefore of short duration andeven started in the somewhat pedestrian tempo of local politics. But in the last few days new vigour was instilled into the campaign from an unusual source.Making a dramatic appearance straight from his visit to Britain, the western front and the Italian front, almost as a deus ex maehina, Mr. Bracken hurledhimself with unexpected passion into the campaign? Mr. Bracken has hithertoshown little gift for leadership and has been sometimes out of harmony withConservative party headquarters. Indeed, his attitude on the conscription issue was even reported unjustifiably to be lukewarm, and his political stock, on his absence from the Federal House, was sinking rapidly. But there was nothinglukewarm or colourless in his behaviour at Grey North. He made the Govern-menfs man-power policy the main target for his attack and never forsook the offensive. He charged that the Governments reinforcements plans were whollyinadequate to meet the conditions of active warfare and challenged the Govern-ment to prove that the demands of the Canadian military headquarters overseashad been met. He insisted that reinforcement needs must be faced as a militaryproblem and not as a matter for political expediency, and he urged that the needsof the men at the front must come first.10. But, not content with a frontal attack on the Governments policy,Mr. Bracken resorted to more sensational forms of appeal. His vilification of thePrime Minister and abusive references to General McNaughton brought an acidnote of personal bitterness into the campaign. He claimed that the overseasforces held General McNaughton in complete contempt and felt that he hadbartered his high trust merely for the sake of office and had allowed his highmilitary rank to be used to effect their betrayal. Mr. Bracken&apos;s histrionic accounts of draftees throwing rifles and munitions overboard while on their way overseasproduced some effect, but were, to say the least, exaggerated. In fact. general mcnaughton subsequently stated that only one isolated soldier had thrown hisrifle and equipment overboard. Finally, the emotional nature of the appeal madeon the needs of the men at the front, whose condition was painted in lurid colours,seems to have been in questionable taste. General McNaughton was clearly stungby the personal abuse hurled at him and particularly by the assertion that the armyitself had lost faith in their former Commander 4n-Chief. But he gave evidence[29440] k n 2
of little political skill. He continued to assert that reinforcements were effectivelygoing forward and to deny the allegations of his opponent. But he had been forced on to the defensive by Mr. Bracken and could only reply by protesting against Mr. Bracken&apos;s &quot;outrageous and rash&quot; statements and with somewhatfutile threats that he would tear Mr. Bracken&apos;s speeches to pieces, and thatMr. Bracken would have to substantiate his statements &quot; or pay the penalty.&quot;For some reason General McNaughton received no support in his campaign fromany of his more prominent Ministerial colleagues, with the exception of thedistant assistance of the Prime Minister : and in retrospect it may be doubted whether the hectoring from the Laurier House worked altogether to the advantageof the Government candidate.11. The C.C.F. candidate was less in the limelight. Air Vice-MarshalGodfrey placed his main emphasis on domestic issues and on post-war policy generally. He largely ignored the conscription issue, but followed the party line that they were in fa\^our of conscription of wealth as well as of man-power. Theonly note of colour brought to the campaign by the C.C F. was when Mr Coldwelltreated his audience to a vision of the new world which awaited them up the&quot; golden stairway &quot; of the C.C.F.12. As conceivably it may have had some slight influence on the vote, itshould be mentioned that certain Conservative papers came out with bannerheadlines on the day of the election with an alleged account of the Liberal partyprogramme, reproduced from an interview published in L&apos;Action Catholique,which reported that Mr. King&apos;s programme Avould include the following points : Nomination of a Canadian Governor-General.Adoption of a Canadian flag.Adoption of a Canadian national anthem.Abolition of appeals to the Privy Council.Entrance of Canada in the Pan-American Union.Independence of Canada (i.e., separation from the British Common-wealth).There was nothing particularly new in the earlier items, but the theme of complete independence was, of course, played up. Incidentally, no official denial of the report has been issued.13. One of the most revealing features of the by-election was general mcnaughton&apos;s complete failure to disguise his petulance and dismay on hisdefeat. He attributed his defeat to &quot; forces of Tory reaction &quot; and described the campaign as the first skirmish in a battle to decide the future of Canada and&quot; whether young men and women would have an opportunity to grow up in free-dom of conscience, of faith and of expression, or whether they would grow up under the bondage of a completely unscrupulous dictatorship which masqueradedunder the false front of a Progressive label.&quot; The Prime Minister, in a separatestatement, attributed the success of the Progressive Conservative candidate tothe splitting of the vote of those who were opposed to reactionary forces. He saidthat the result immediately raised the question whether any useful purpose wouldbe served by having another session of Parliament and reiterated that theOpposition parties by their attitudes had created and fostered circumstancesmaking a general election inevitable. Without being more precise, he announcedthat the Government would give immediate and close attention to this aspect ofthe situation. Mr. Case, however, felt sufficiently cheered with the result to congratulate his opponents on a clean fight!14. The Progressive Conservatives are naturally jubilant at the result,which has, of course, raised Mr. Bracken&apos;s stock from the depths to which it had fallen. But the party are in no position to form an alternative administration and they have so far made no triumphant demands for hastening the generalelection. It is significant that, in his only public speech since the election,Mr. Bracken has called not for the resignation of the Government, but only forthe resignation of General McNaughton.15. The failure of the C.C.F. came as a general surprise and their candidatelost his deposit. It is to be remembered that the party were contesting the constituency for the first time and, perhaps deliberately, the role they playedwas somewhat subdued. But the main result is, of course, the heavy blow at theGovernment. Although local considerations may have played some part Mr. Case was a local man, whereas General McNaughten was an outsider whotactlessly emphasised his temporary interest in Grey North by announcing that
he proposed to run in Saskatchewan at the general election the vote can onlybe regarded as an indication of the declining popularity of the Government andof the resentment, in Ontario at least, at their handling of the man-power-question. As a significant pointer to the weakening support for the Government,it may be worth mentioning that the Winnipeg Free Press (normally a Liberalorgan) contended editorially that General McNaughton&apos;s speeches on conscrip-tion were evasive and inconclusive, and said frankly that the General had muchto learn as a political campaigner. The article summed up that the by-electionhad weakened an already tottering Parliament and that all that had been achievedwas to make plainer than ever the need for a general election.16. Grey North is but the curtain-raiser to the general election. That willbe called, no doubt, for whatever time the political wizardry of Mr. mackenzie king judges to be the most propitious for the interest of the Liberal party. GreyNorth itself provides no conclusive lessons for the opinion of the country as awhole, but the rumble of discontent with the Governments man-power policy isominous.17. I am sending copies of this despatch to United Kingdom ambassador at Washington and United Kingdom High Commissioners at Canberra,Wellington and Pretoria.I have, &amp;c.MALCOLM MacDONALD.
