THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1945.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.   It is issuedTOP SECRET /   Copy NoW.P. (45) 177.18th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-POLISH SECRET PROTOCOL OF 1939.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 10th August, 1944, I circulated to my colleagues a memorandum(W.P. (44) 438) explaining why I considered it preferable at that time to postpone the publication, which I hoped eventually to arrange, of the Secret Protocol tothe Anglo-Polish Agreement of Mutual Assistance of the 25th August, 1939.The text of the Protocol was annexed to my memorandum.2. In the course of the debate on Poland in the House of Commons on the28th February Mr. Petherick referred to the existence of this SecretProtocol and quoted from it Article 3. Although I did not know from what quarter Mr. Petherick had obtained his information, I felt obliged, in replying to the debate, to refer to this matter. In doing so explained that the effect of the Secret Protocol was precisely to limit the obliga-tions laid before the House in the 1939 Agreement, and not to increase them. Inthis connexion I recalled the statement made by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons on the19th October, 1939, which was referred to in the third paragraph of W.P. (44) 438.3. Mr. Petherick sought to argue that Article 3 of the Secret Protocolmeant that if Great Britain or Poland made a new Agreement with another country that new Agreement should not prejudice either partner to the Treaty,and he implied that for this reason the declaration on Poland agreed upon atthe Crimea Conference was contrary to the obligations entered into by HisMajesty&apos;s Government with the Polish Government in the 1939 Treaty. I did not enter into a discussion of this point in my reply in the House. The answer is,however, simple enough. The effect of Article 3 of the Secret Protocol is to statethat any undertakings of assistance against aggression entered into by either of the contracting parties shall be so framed that their execution should at no time prejudice either the sovereignty or the territorial inviolability of the other contracting party. In fact, the only undertaking entered into by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment which might be considered relevant is the Anglo-Soviet Treaty oP1942. That Treaty, however, contained no provision which could in any waybe held to be inconsistent with the provisions of Clause 3 of the Secret Protocol.Still less is the Crimea Declaration inconsistent with those provisions, since itis a statement of the agreed views of the three major Powers upon the territorialsettlement of Poland which they consider should be effected in future with theagreement of the new Polish Provisional Government of National Unity to be formed in Poland. The Declaration does not alter the juridical position underwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government, while they have not recognised any territorialchanges that have taken place in Poland in or since 1939, have equally neverguaranteed any specific Polish frontiers. I append as Annex I a memorandumby the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office which examines this question in greater detail.12713   [29454] bf
4. In view of the public references to the Secret Protocol which have nowbeen made in Parliament, there will probably be a demand that the documentshould be laid on the table of the House. I understand that inasmuch as the protocol is a secret document, and I did not myself quote from it, I would notbe obliged by the rules of the House to lay it. I nevertheless consider it desirablethat this should now be done, provided that the Polish Government consent toour doing so.5. At the time when I circulated my earlier memorandum I considered, asI there explained, that the principal disaclvantages in publishing the Protocollay in the fact that such action might give rise to (a) undesirable ventilation of polish claims, and (b) suspicions in the minds of the Soviet Government which mightadversely affect Anglo-Soviet relations and our attempt to bring about an agreed solution of the Polish problem. Neither of these objections is now as strong asit then was. Polish claims have already to some extent been aired. Moreover.Soviet suspicions will doubtless already have been aroused and the advantages of attempting to dispel such suspicions by publishing the full text seem to menow to outweigh the risk of possible harmful repercussions upon Anglo-soviet relations.6. Further, the Crimea proposals foreshadow the establishment indue course in Poland of a new Polish Provisional Government of national unity to which the recognition of His Majesty&apos;s Government would be trans-ferred. I am advised that when that happens our obligations underthe Anglo-Polish Treaty of 1939 will continue in relation to the new ProvisionalGovernment unless of course His Majesty&apos;s Government had in the meantimeexercised - their right to terminate the Treaty at six months&apos; notice. In thesecircumstances it seems to me desirable that the terms of the Secret Protocol shouldbe brought out into the light of day before the time comes for us to transferour recognition. It might well prove embarrassing if we were to go to Warsawwith the Protocol still locked up in our cupboard.7. Since the initiative in revealing the existence of the Secret Protocolhas not come from His Majesty&apos;s Government, it might possibly be argued thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be entitled to publish the Protocol without consultation with the Polish Government as the other contracting party. Apartfrom the discourtesy which such action might be held to involve, I consider thatwe should be unwise in our own interests to proceed to publication without havingsought the Polish Governments consent. My chief reason for this lies in theexistence of the hitherto unpublished correspondence exchanged with the PolishGovernment in the spring of 1942 at the time of our negotiations with the SovietGovernment for the Anglo-Soviet Treaty. This lengthy correspondence containedreferences to and interpretations of the Secret Protocol of 1939. A summary ofthe principal relevant passages is annexed to this paper (Annex II). If wewere to publish the Protocol without seeking the Polish Governments agreement the latter might feel tempted to retaliate by publishing all or part of this 1942correspondence. Such publication, particularly if it took place without warning to ourselves and was accompanied by tendentious interpretation on the part ofthe Polish Government, might well provoke controversy here and suspicion in soviet Russia. The points and arguments involved in the correspondence are so intricate that clever controversialists such as the Poles could make public discussion of them highly embarrassing for His Majesty&apos;s Government..8. I accordingly propose, subject to the agreement of my colleagues, toinform the Polish Government that in view of the revelations in the debate on the28th February we propose, subject to their consent, to lay the Secret Protocolbefore the House.9. It is possible that the Polish Government might withhold their consent.M. Mikolajczyk once volunteered the opinion to me that it would be a seriousmistake from the Polish point of view that the Secret Protocol should bepublished. In this event, I would propose, if the question of the publication ofthe Protocol is raised in Parliament, to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government had sought the Polish Governments agreement to publication, but had not received it,and in these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government considered it would bediscourteous to publish the Protocol at the present stage and had therefore decided not to do so. This answer, while not suggesting that the Polish Govern-ments refusal to consent is an absolute bar to publication, would be in line withthe desirable principle that transactions between Governments should in generalnot be published without mutual consent. It should also, I should hope, satisfy the House.
ANNEX I.The Crimea Protocol and Our Commitments to Poland.THE papers and minutes on this subject have now reached such dimensionsthat I think the only thing I can usefully do is to set out the essential elements of the situation as I see them without attempting to go into detail.2. What we have undertaken to do by the Crimea Protocol, and what we hadbeen attempting to do for months beforehand, is to bring about an arrangement with a Polish Government recognised by the Three Powers under which theeastern frontier of Poland should follow the Curzon Line with slight modifica-tions in favour of Poland, that country receiving compensation in the North and west. This proposal has been criticised in the recent debates on political grounds, with which I am not concerned. What I have to deal with is thequestion whether, by agreeing to try to bring about such an arrangement, we haveviolated any of our commitments to Poland.3. It is surely clear, whether our critics realise it or not, that an affirmativeanswer to this question can only be based on the idea that we have in some wayundertaken to see that in no circumstances should Poland lose any of the territories which she possessed before the war. Nothing short of this can justify an allegation that we are debarred from trying to bring about the proposed arrangement.4. It is perfectly plain that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not possibly have entered into such a commitment. No British Government could guarantee that in no circumstances should Poland lose territory either to Russia orGermany. It may, indeed, be doubted (since Article 10 of the Covenant has inpractice remained a dead letter) whether such a guarantee has ever been givento any country except in certain special cases, such as neutralised Belgium, wherethe guarantors were certainly in a position to implement their guarantee. Inthe particular case of Poland there is the further consideration that, of the[29454]10. If, on the other hand, the Polish Government consent to publication ofthe Protocol, I would propose to inform the Soviet and United States Govern-ments of our intentions before laying the Protocol. In doing so I would explain that the object and effect of the Secret Protocol, as it says in terms and was stated publicly by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the time, were not to extend theobligations of the parties but to limit them by confining these obligations, whichin the Agreement were stated in general terms, to the particular case of aggression by Germany. I would add that in particular one object of the protocol was to avoid any obligation on our part to assist Poland against theSoviet Union, and that the reason for the adoption of this procedure is to befound in the special emergencies of the time and was, of course, that while theparties were in fact concluding an agreement of mutual assistance against aggression by Germany it was considered undesirable to state this in public. Iwould explain in conclusion that His Majesty&apos;s Government have felt it undesirable in the present greatly changed circumstances to withhold thisProtocol any longer.11. Finally, I would propose similarly to inform the French ProvisionalGovernment of our intention, since the French Government were informed of theexistence of the Secret Protocol in 1939, and also the Belgian and NetherlandsGovernments, whose countries are the subject of a reference in Article 2 (b) ofthe Protocol.12. I invite the concurrence of my colleagues in the proceedings proposed above.A. E.Foreign Office, 18th March, 1945.
territories whose perpetual possession by Poland would have been guaranteed by us, those to the East of the Curzon Line were acquired contrary to our expressadvice, while Vilna was obtained by most dubious methods, to which the Councilof the League took the strongest exception.5. It is plain that the Anglo-Polish Treaty of 1939 involved no suchguarantee. We have stated frequently, and the statement has not been challenged,that the Treaty guaranteed no Polish frontiers. Our commitment under it wasto come to Poland&apos;s assistance if she was attacked by Germany, and that commit-ment we have fulfilled. If we had lost the war Germany would presumablyhave compelled us to sign a peace treaty under which she acquired large stretchesof Polish territory, but our signature of such a treaty would not have involvedany failure on our part to comply with our obligations to Poland.6. If the Treaty did not involve any such commitment, the Secret Protocolcannot have clone so either, because it states in paragraph 4 that it &quot; does not extend the scope &quot; of the Treaty. The object of Article 3 was not to produce anysuch commitment, but to prevent us from doing what the Russians had been trying to get us to do in the summer of 1939, i.e., to enter into a treaty of alliance withthem against Germany which would recognise their right to violate Polishterritory in order to facilitate their conduct of a war against Germany.7. The observations in paragraphs 3 and 4 above are equally applicable toour correspondence with the Poles during the war, which must be interpreted in the light of them. It is. moreover, plain that, since the Treaty did not involvethe suggested commitment, it is inconceivable that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould, without the knowledge and consent of Parliament, have entered into sucha commitment by means of unpublished correspondence. Moreover, at the timeof the correspondence the whole of Polish territory was in German occupation,and Russia had purported to incorporate the eastern portion of it in the soviet union, so that the suggested commitment would have involved an obligation onour part to turn both those countries out.8. The statements in the 1942 correspondence were made to the Poles inconnexion with the negotiations of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty. It is material to remember that we had made repeated statements to the effect that we did not recognise territorial changes effected during the war and that such matters must await the peace settlement, and that therefore it would have been impossiblefor us, without Polish consent, to recognise by the Treaty the incorporation of polish territories in the Soviet Union. We had to be careful about this point,because the earlier drafts of the Treaty did deal with territorial questions, andthe object of our statements was to reassure the Poles about it. The effect,accordingly, of the statement (which may be taken as typical of what we said in that correspondence) that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose to conclude any agreement affecting or compromising the territorial status of thePolish Republic, and it is their intention, in any agreement which may be concluded, to safeguard the assurance given to you on the occasion of the Polish-Soviet Agreement last July &quot; was precisely what it said that we would not, inany agreement resulting from these negotiations, affect or compromise theterritorial status of Poland. In the event the Treaty did not deal with suchterritorial questions, and our undertaking was fully carried out. But. for thereasons stated above, the undertaking did not mean, and cannot have meant, thatwe would never try to bring about with Polish consent an agreement under whichthe territories east of the Curzon Line were restored to Russia, or that (which is really the same thing) we would not agree to any peace settlement which did notrestore Poland to her pre-war frontiers the impossibility of which (whether thewar were won or lost) was manifest in 1942.9. The conclusion is that we are under no obligation to see that Poland neverloses any of her pre-war territory, and that there is nothing in our commitments to Poland which prevents us from trying to bring about with Polish consent thearrangements proposed in the Crimea Protocol. But if we were, before the peace settlement and without Polish consent, to recognise the incorporation of Polishterritories in the Soviet Union, the position would be different, and we could justlybe charged with a breach, perhaps of our undertakings to Poland, and certainly ofour public statements about non-recognition before the peace settlement of territorial changes effected during the war. But this is not what is proposed inthe Crimea Protocol.
10. Any argument based on the Atlantic Charter can only be addressed tothe Russians and not to us. They have their answer, which is, presumably, thatit is not &quot; territorial aggrandisement &quot; to recover territories which- (a) had been Russian until she was deprived of them, as the result of defeatin war, by the Treaty of Riga;(b) should, as His Majesty&apos;s Government admit, form part of the soviet union on ethnological grounds;(c) had been voluntarily incorporated in the Soviet Union before the atlantic charter was signed.As regards (a) and (b), His Majesty&apos;s Government can accept this answer.9th March, 1945.1 . ANNEX II.AT the time of the negotiations for the Anglo-Soviet Treaty in the spring of1942 there was considerable public anxiety lest by signing the treaty HisMajesty&apos;s GoA^ernment should injure the interests of Poland and the Baltic Statesand it was felt important to try to secure the acquiescence of the Polish Govern-ment, who were then still in relations with Soviet Russia, in the proposed treatyarrangements. In the course of the correspondence that ensued the PolishGovernment argued, inter alia, that the contemplated agreement with SovietRussia would infringe the spirit if not the letter of the Anglo-Polish Agreementof 1939. They maintained in particular that Article 2 (b) of the Secret Protocolamounted to the express recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government that themaintenance of the independence of Lithuania is of exactly the same vital interestto the security of Poland as the maintenance of the independence of Belgium andthe Netherlands is to the security of Great Britain.2. Replying to this point in a note to the Polish Ambassador dated the17th April, 1942, I pointed out that in view of Article 1 (a) of the Secret Protocol&quot; any implicit recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the vital importanceof Lithuania to the security of Poland could only apply to the possibility of a threat from Germany.&quot; The Polish Government then argued that Article 2 (2)of the 1939 Agreement itself involved a mutual recognition by each of our twoGovernments that the independence and neutrality of certain States represents a vital interest for the security of the other; that this mutual recognition is not limited to the case of aggression by Germany; but that under Article 1 (b) of the secret Protocol His Majesty&apos;s Government would be bound to consult with thePolish Government upon the measures to be taken in common in the event of a threat to the independence of Lithuania by Soviet Russia.3. My reply to this note, dated the 6th May, 1942, contained the following passage: &quot; This further explanation of the interpretation placed by the PolishGovernment upon the Anglo-Polish Agreement and the Secret Protocol suggests,however, that it does not differ substantially from that of His Majesty&apos;a Govern-ment. His Majesty&apos;s Government have always regarded Article 2 (b) of the secret Protocol as involving a recognition by them that the independence ofLithuania was of importance to Poland. They take the view, however, that thecircumstances which would bring Article 2 (2) of the agreement into operation inconsequence of a threat to the independence of Lithuania have not arisen, andthat the provision in question would not be applicable if the threat came fromthe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Your note makes it clear that this interpretation is not disputed by the Polish Government.&quot;
