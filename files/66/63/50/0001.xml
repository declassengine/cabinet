Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (45) 195.25th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.MEASURES TAKEN BY BRITISH COMMONWEALTH TO PROVIDEASYLUM FOR REFUGEES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1. At&apos;their meeting on the 13th November (W.M. (44) 149th Conclusions,paragraph 8), the War Cabinet approved a memorandum by the Minister of State(W.P. (44) 608 of the 30th October, 1944) with a draft communication to theUnited States Government showing what we had done to provide accommodation for refugees during the war. The proposed communication arose out of theso-called &quot; Horthy offer &quot; to release a large number of Jews from Hungary, andits object was to explain why the British Commonwealth could not take a biggershare in finding them accommodation. The Governments of the Dominions were consulted beforehand and authorised the communication of the relevant figures inrespect of their territories.2. The War Cabinet approved the proposal subject to a slight addition tothe draft and to the statement being communicated to the Dominion governments before it was finally sent to the United States Government.3. The Governments of South Africa and New Zealand have approved thestatement with slight textual amendments. The Government of Australia havenot yet replied. The Canadian Government, on the other hand, now state that, intheir opinion, it would be preferable not to include Annex II of W.P. (44) 608in any communication to the State Department. This annex gives the number of refugees, &amp;c, accommodated in the Dominions, and the Canadian government think that its inclusion might give rise to misunderstanding, since the figuresdo not result from a policy which is the responsibility of the United Kingdomand might therefore leave the impression that an attempt was being madeimproperly to enhance the total figures.4. Conditions have so changed since this proposal was first put to the WarCabinet that I am inclined to think we should take the opportunity of theCanadian Governments refusal to drop the whole project. The &quot; Horthy offer,&quot;which was its original occasion, has fallen through, and in any case conditions have radically altered since it was made, so that any criticism we might have hadto face in the United States on this score will no longer arise. The information which we have collected, on the other hand, will still be available if we shouldever have need of it in the future. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsconcurs and is willing to explain the position to Dominion Governments.5.   I shall be grateful for my colleagues&apos; approval of this course.A. E.Foreign Office, 25th March, 1945.12724   [29507]
