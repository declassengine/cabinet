THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  December 1944.Copy No.WAR CABINET.DOCTORS AND NURSES.Memorandum  by the Minister of Labour and  National  Service,  theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland.1. There is to-day a serious shortage of doctors and nurses, and it is certain that in 1945 these shortages will become even more acute. The fact isthat in the sixth year of war it is no longer possible to meet all of even thoseneeds which must be classed as essential. Nothing can remedy or could haveremedied this completely, but we suggest in this paper certain palliatives.2.   The principal demands on medical staff are for service (a) At home, for the care of the civil population, for the public health andindustrial medical services, and for the treatment of Service patients in civil hospitals and convalescent homes;(&amp;) In the Forces (including the Indian Army) both at home and overseas;(c) In the Dominions, India and the Colonies;(d) On civil relief work overseas (including the control of epidemics);(e) As missionaries abroad;(/) Possibly, under Control Commissions in enemy territory.3. The Medical care of the civil population at home is now barely adequate,and in some services is to-day, and has been for some time, below an acceptablestandard. It is estimated that even to maintain tolerable standards and soavoid the risk of scandal, it would be necessary for some 2,000 doctors to be released from the Forces during the first half of 1945. The majority of theseare needed to reinforce general practice, but the estimate includes about 130doctors for the tuberculosis service, the deterioration of which is now causingserious anxiety. The shortage of nurses is no less acute, at least 2,500 additionalnurses being required for the tuberculosis service alone. Including the latter,there are, altogether, vacancies in hospitals and similar institutions for 29,000 -nurses, of whom from 8,000 to 10,000 should be fully trained.So far from the Forces being able to release, without replacement, the numberof doctors and nurses required, they estimate that they will need to ask for about an additional 1,900 doctors and 2,700 nurses (practically all trained nurses) tomeet demands particularly in the Far East for the first six months of 1945.There is also a substantial demand for both doctors and nurses for civilian service in the Colonies and in India and a smaller one for the Dominions. Up to thepresent the number of doctors and nurses recruited for civil relief work overseashas not been large, but it is increasing and may soon be formidable. There is a steady though small demand, particularly on nursing staff, for missionary workabroad. The demand for medical staff for service under Control Commissions in enemy territory is not yet known, but may prove to be significant.4. In summary, provisional estimates for the first half of 1945 showprobable demands for additions of about 4,000 doctors and, say, 35,000 nurses,including more than 10,000 trained nurses. Towards this the net intakes of thetwo professions will not provide more than about 1,000 doctors and a small proportion of the nurses required. Towards the requirement of at least 10,000trained nurses the net intake will certainly not exceed 3,500. It will thus beimpossible to meet demands in full and priorities will need most careful examina-tion. For this there is already machinery. The relative priorities of demands for doctors as between the Armed Forces and civil requirements are determinedby the Lord Presidents Committee on the advice of the Secretary of State for[28814]SECRET.W.P. (44) 727.12th December, 1944.
Dominion Affairs. Lord Cranborne&apos;s advice is given after consultation withthe Ministers concerned and with the assistance of a Committee under the Chair-manship of Sir Geoffrey Shakespeare and of the Central Medical War Com-niittee. The allocation of nurses to the Armed Forces is determined by the Man-Power Committee. The machinery under which quotas are fixed upon therecommendation of an independent Minister has been of great value. We hopethat this system will be extended first for the determination of quotas of doctorsfor all the categories defined in paragraph 2 and. second, for the determination of a quota of nurses for each of the categories.5. Doctors and nurses required for civil relief work overseas, includingthe control of epidemics (category (d) of para. 2), are at present recruitedby Civil Affairs Branch, by U.N.R.R.A. and, on their behalf or under directarrangements with foreign Governments, by individual Voluntary Societies.Under this system there is a danger of overlapping and it is impossible toexercise effective control over the release of doctors and nurses, from the man-power point of view. For example, there is at the moment a need for doctors and nurses for civil relief work in Holland, and S.H.A.E.F. have made requests for a considerable number of doctors and nurses for this purpose both toU.N.R.R.A. and to the Red Cross. We think that machinery must be provided to co-ordinate demands for medical staff for relief work overseas before thedemands become too large. We think also that demands of this kind should bemet as far as possible by U.N.R.R.A. a body which was set up for this verypurpose and which is able, being an international body, to draw on medical staffof foreign nationalities and so save British man-power. It is not easy to arrangethis because except in the Balkans, where there are special arrangements civil affairs Branch and not U.N.R.R.A. are responsible for relief work during themilitary phase and even when that phase is over U.N.R.R.A. can work only in territories whose Governments wish to have its help. We suggest that thereshould be two quotas of doctors and two of nurses for civil relief overseas oneof each for&quot; Civil Affairs and for U.N.R.R.A.; that there should be close consul-tation between U.N.R.R.A. and Civil Affairs to prevent overlapping and ensurethat full use is made of U.N.R.R.A. staff by Civil Affairs until, when the militaryphase is over, they are needed by U.N.R.R.A. themselves; and that any doctors ornurses recruited direct by Voluntary Societies should be counted against the quota of Civil Affairs or that of U.N.R.R.A. We recognise that this lastsuggestion will cause some difficulty, after the military phase, in territorieswhose Governments do not wish to use U.N.R.R.A., but these Governments havealready been asked to consult U.N.R.R.A. before making any direct arrangementsfor relief work with a Voluntary Society, and we think it would be reasonable,and is indeed essential, to reinforce this by making U.N.R.R.A. the sole pool(apart from Civil Affairs) for medical staff.6. To sum up, we recommend that the following arrangements should bemade : (a) Quotas of doctors and nurses to be drawn up--as is now done in thecase of doctors required for the Forces for all the categories defined in paragraph 2.(&amp;) Nursing quotas, as well as the quotas of doctors, to be determined onthe recommendation of an independent Minister.(c) In determining quotas, full weight to be given to the pressing civilneeds, including the needs of Service patients in civil hospitals.(d) So far as practicable, demands for doctors and nurses for civil relief work overseas (including epidemic control) to be met by or through U.N.R.R.A. The quotas for this work to be divided into two one for Civil Affairs and one for U.N.R.R.A., close consultationbeing maintained between them to prevent waste of British man-power.(e) Any doctors or nurses recruited by Voluntary Societies for relief workoverseas to be counted against the quota of Civil Affairs or that of u.N.R.R.A.E.
