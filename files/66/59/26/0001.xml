THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 726.12th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.GERMAN CONCENTRATION CAMPS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I think my colleagues may be interested to see the attached record of a recentconversation between a member of the Foreign Office and a Pole who has recentlyreached this country, in which the latter described his experiences in Germanconcentration camps, where he had been for the past four years.&apos;A. E.Foreign Office, 12th December, 1944.The Counsellor of the Polish Embassy invited me to lunch yesterdayto meet Prince Cjetwertynsski, a member of a distinguished Polish family,who has now arrived in this country to join the Polish Army, after spendingover four years in German concentration camps. M. Kulski thought that an account of the Prince&apos;s experiences might be useful to us. Prince Cjetwertynsski,who was well known to Mr. Hankey in ,Warsaw before the war, made an excellentimpression on me. He was calm and moderate, and, far from exaggeratingconditions in concentration camps, he seemed to me to play them down. Igathered that Prince Cjetwertynsski was writing an account of his experienceswhich would be somewhat &quot; bowdlerised &quot; with a view to publication. I told him and M. Kulski that? it seemed to me essential that he should also write out a full account for the Polish Government to present to the United Nations war crimes Commission as it would be a most valuable piece of evidence. PrinceCjetwertynsski has, of course, been interrogated by the War Office.Prince Cjetwertynsski had escaped when his unit was surrounded by theGermans in the Polish campaign of 1939, and had subsequently been arrestedas a political prisoner in 1940. He had then been transferred from prison to prison and finally lodged in the concentration camp at Sachsenhausen. not until almost a year later was he taken back to Warsaw to be interrogated andit was only then that he received an indication of the charges against him,which were, of course, connected with Polish underground activity. He wasthen sent back to a concentration camp and in the course of the next two yearshe spent considerable periods of time at Oswiecim, Goussen (I am not quite sure whether I caught this name right) here he met his father, his uncle and hisbrother, who are still in concentration camps- and at a camp 10 miles fromHamburg. Here he was a spectator of the famous R.A.F. raids of July 1943.He was later moved to the Pas de Calais, where he and his companions were compelled to build flying bomb sites. He escaped in early September, when the prisoners were being marched back to Germany and confusion was caused throughAllied planes machine-gunning the column on the roads. He has since beenwith the 12th Corps.Prince Cjetwertynsski said that, apart from Dachau, which was a model con-centration camp, conditions in all the others were very similar and bad. Dachau,however, was very well equipped and was a show-place for foreign visitors. the prisoners from other camps were often sent to Dachau for a few weeks&apos; rest and treatment if it was thought that this would increase their strength for manual labour when they returned to their camps. There were about seventeen other12600   [28809]
large camps, which each housed some 15,000 to 20,000 inmates, and, in addition,a larger number of smaller camps with a few thousand immates each. The campswere run entirely by the Gestapo and were more or less sealed off from the restof the world. Even Gestapo men not concerned with the camp administrationwere not allowed in. Within the camp the normal administration was leftentirely to the prisoners. Some camps were worse than others, depending uponthe personality of the Gamp Commandant, but all were bad. The inmates were expected to work ten hours a day and sometimes eleven in summer on an altogetherinsufficient diet. They kept themselves alive entirely on parcels from home, which reached them regularly. The Germans encouraged this, as they knew the campdiet was insufficient to keep the workers alive. The camp population includedall nationalities, including German prisoners, who were divided into political prisoners and ordinary criminals. The only division in the camp was betweenpolitical prisoners and the criminals but within the camp limits all were free to mix together. The majority of the foreigners were Poles and Russians, andthe best elements among the Germans were the Communists. Even they, however,betrayed the Herrenvolk spirit, as the following story will show. The blockleader in one camp was a well-known German Communist. In his block therewas also the only Belgian Communist Senator. The German Communist blockleader took pleasure in making the Belgian Communist Senator wash his feetevery morning. Within the camps the Russians were the most unfortunate andthe most unpopular, especially the Ukrainians, who were hated by the GreatRussians,. the Germans and the Poles alike. They were, however, unlucky asthey received no parcels from home and were therefore reduced to petty theftfrom their comrades. This was the one great crime in the camp and usuallyresulted in summary justice from the prisoners themselves.To every camp a gas chamber was attached. When I expressed some disgustat this, Prince Cjetwertynsski replied that this was one of the most humanefeatures of camp life; he could tell me far worse things than that. When hewas at Oswiecim, a convoy of 10,000 Jews from Allied countries were broughtthere. After taking out some seventy artisans, who could be used in the camp,the others were all gassed at the rate of about 250 a day. PrinceCjetwertynsski knew members of the special squad which was used for cleaningout the gas chambers and burning the bodies, and had no doubt of the facts.He told me that this special squad was composed of volunteers who were givenspecially favourable treatment, e.g., unlimited cigarettes, better food, &amp;c. Therewas always a surplus of volunteers, more particularly from among the Jewishprisoners, as people wanted this three months&apos; relative comfort although they knew that at the end of three months the cleansing squad were all themselvespassed through the gas chamber since they knew too much to be left alive.Prince Cjetwertynsski also told me of the arrival at one of the camps -Ithink Oswiecim of 400 Russian political commissars. Forty men of the&quot;Penal Commando &quot; in the camp, i.e., the most hardened and degraded amongthe camp inmates, were given sticks and turned into a neighbouring enclosurewith the 400 commissars with instructions to murder them all. - A battue tookplace which lasted some hours, at the end of which all the commissars had beenbeaten to death.The gas chambers were also used for killing persons who had. become tooweak for work and who were too far gone to benefit from the relative rest cureat Dachau. Alternatively, if if was not thought worth while to work the gaschambers, such men were given a strong dose of phenol, which killed them in theirsleep. Prince Cjetwertynsski admitted that there was some principle behindthese killings. The German theory was that all people in the concentration campwere there because they were a positive danger to society. So long as they couldperform work useful to society they were left alive. When they ceased to be fit for this, then the only thing to do was to kill them.Among the German prisoners there was a special category, known as&apos;&apos; Ehren-Haftlinge &quot; (prisoners in honourable confinement). These wereprisoners against whom there was no charge, but who, owing to their politicalviews, were considered a potential danger. They received relatively favourable treatment and were allowed to return home on leave when there were specialoccasions, such as a birth in the family or the bombing of the family home by theR.A.F. Prince Cjetwertynsski used to ask these people why they ever returnedafter their leave. They took the line that it was quite impossible to hide oneselfin Germany, and that, anyway, life in a concentration camp with the stimulatingsociety of the foreign political prisoners was infinitely preferable to life at libertyin war-time Nazi Germany.
Prince Cjetwertynsski was in a camp outside Hamburg during the Julyraids of 1943. These had cheered up the concentration camp inmates immensely,more particularly as special care had been taken not to bomb the camp, over which warning markers had been dropped at the beginning of the raid. the prisoners were used for over six months in clearing up Hamburg. Everythinghad caught fire and the town continued burning for several days. The germans had announced the official casualty list as 700 dead. Prisoners who had goneon clearing bodies out of shelters for months and months calculated the dead atseveral hundred thousand.Prince Cjetwertynsski had nothing very new to say about his experiences inFrance, beyond the fact that the Germans had been at great pains only to send, toFrance political prisoners who could not speak French. He himself had been sentthere through some mistake, but, rather typically, the German camp commandant,instead of sending him back as he should have done, decided to use him as aninterpreter. This had meant much lighter work during the last few months ofhis imprisonment.F. K. ROBERTS.Foreign Office, 8th December, 1944.
