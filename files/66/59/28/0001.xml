MAN-POWER REQUIREMENTS-JANUARY TO JUNE 1945.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE R.A.F. man-power requirements are based on the following assumptionsand decisions : 1(a) that the German war ends on the 30th June, 1945;(6) that after June 1945 there will be a progressive reduction in the strengthof the R.A.F. to the level of 327 squadrons required for Stage II.This level is planned to be reached nine months after the end of theGerman war;(c) that there is to be no R.A.F. expansion beyond December 1944 (W.M. (44)100th Conclusions);id) that every effort is to be made to maintain the first-line strength betweenDecember 1944 and June 1945.   A marked decline in RAF. strikingpower will be inevitable if the German war continues beyond June1945;(e) that, of the 17,200 trained mechanics fit for overseas service to be madeavailable to the Fleet Air Arm at the end of the German war(W.M. (43) 164th Conclusions), 11,000 will be transferred by the30th June, 1945, at the request of the Admiralty.2. The flying training organisation has been progressively reduced duringthe last twelve months and is now in the concluding stages of contraction to thelevel required for Stage II.3. The technical training organisation, which has been drastically curtailedin order to enable the maximum front line expansion to be reached, will now haveto be increased in order to make provision : (a) To meet Stage II requirements where these are different in characterfrom Stage I requirements; for example, a higher proportion of radarmechanics is required in Stage II than in Stage I.(b) To replace men whose tour of duty overseas has expired.(c) To allow for the introduction of a leave scheme in overseas theatres, in parallel with the War Office scheme.id) To offset the release of men in high priority classes.(e) To produce a sufficient number of tradesmen who are fit for overseas service. In Stage II the greater proportion of the force will beoverseas.In short, the R.A.F. must now urgently prepare for the needs of Stage II, andthe commitments stated above must be met if a rapid and efficient re-deploymentagainst Japan is to be effected at the end of the German war. The total intakerequired into the training organisation on this account is 50,000 men. These menmust be fit for overseas service and in low release priority.[288121s&quot;Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1944. X *J O
4. In order to make available the maximum number of young fit men for more active combatant duties, the R.A.F. has so far accepted in the ground tradesa high proportion of older men and men of low medical grades. Therefore,allowing for releases at the end of Stage I, it will be impossible to make available from the ground trades a sufficient number of men of the medical standardrequired and suitable release priority to meet the training requirement of 50,000stated above. I am prepared, nevertheless, to make the difficult assumption thatsome 35,000 men can be made available from these trades, together with 9,000surplus aircrew personnel, and to budget for a deficit.5. The disposal of surplus aircrew personnel is a highly complex and delicateproblem, having regard to the special conditions of service under which theyvolunteered, their relatively high rates of pay and their good prospects of promotion in non-commissioned and to commissioned rank. A scheme has,however, been worked out and will shortly be put into effect to withdraw pupilsfrom aircrew training at various stages and to give them (with the exception ofthose enlisted as the result of the special &quot; waiver &quot; of the Schedule of reserved occupations, who will be returned to industry) the option (a) of transfer to theRoyal Navy, Royal Marines or Army, or (b) of training in a R.A.F. ground tradewith a view to employment overseas, probably in South-East Asia. This procedurewill apply to some 11,000 pupils, the majority of whom are in schools in theDominions, and it will be some time before they can be made available in thiscountry. I envisage that some 2,000 of this total may exercise their option to join the Army or Navy. Should a greater number exercise this option, it will benecessary to ask for an intake of fit men against the release of airmen ineligiblefor establishment vacancies overseas.6. A total of some 5,000 men will be released from the R.A.F. Regiment asa result of the projected disbandment of 26 squadrons of the Regiment. As,however, three-quarters of the then remaining units will be on overseas service in Stage I, and the remainder are their only source of reinforcement, the majorityof the men available for release are likely to be of low medical category and,consequently, of doubtful value for overseas service. The release of these 5,000men from the R.A.E. will increase my difficulties in providing for the requirementsdescribed in paragraph 3 above; but I am prepared to do this, in view of theArmy&apos;s needs.7. To summarise : For the period under review the Royal Air Force will endeavour to meet its commitments and make the essential preparations for stage II without any general service intake. This involves the serious risk thatI shall be unable to find, by internal re-distribution, the 50,000 fit men requiredby the Royal Air Force; but I am prepared to accept this risk. On this basis,in addition to the 11,000 trained mechanics for the Fleet Air Arm, I can make available a total of some 7,000 men for release from the Royal Air Force in theperiod under review. Of these, however, 5,000 are likely to be of low medicalcategory, and the 2,000 aircrew will not be available until the second quarter ofthe year.8. I have, however, to ask for an entry of 10,000 industrial civilians (ofwhom 1,000 are for the U.S.A.A.F.), together with 250 youths for training asaircraft apprentices, and 400 nurses,I A. H. M.
