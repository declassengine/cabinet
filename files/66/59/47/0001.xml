THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.a/,;SECRET. /     Copy No.    3W.P. (44) 747.ISth December, 1944.WAR CABINET.WORLD ORGANISATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs.MY colleagues will now have seen the various papers on World organisation which have recently been circulated to them, and I hope that the Cabinet willbe able to consider these matters at an early date.2.   I annex hereto copies of telegrams sent by President Roosevelt to marshal Stalin and the Prime Minister.   It will be seen that in effect president roosevelt now proposes that we should all agree on Compromise &quot; A &quot; as defined in paragraphs 14 and 15 of Sir A. Cadogams memorandum of the 22nd November, /A.P.W. (44) 117).  Provided the Dominions (who have now been consulted) agree,i I feel that there is much to be said for our supporting this proposal, for the\ reasons given in Sir A. Cadogan&apos;s memorandum.3. It will be noted that the Presidents proposal goes beyondCompromise &quot; A &quot; in two small respects. In the first place it introduces the ideaof decisions being made by a seven-elevenths majority; in the second it extendsthe principle that &apos;&apos; parties to a dispute should not vote &apos;&apos; to any regionalmachinery that may be established for the purpose of settling disputes.4. With regard to the majority, seven-elevenths is, of course, a compromise between a simple majority (six) and a two-thirds majority (which would bedeemed to be eight). Only two non-permanent members of the Security council would therefore have to be associated with the permanent members before any decision could be taken. This, I think, is a reasonable compromise on which we need not quarrel.5. As regards regional machinery, the Presidents intention is perhaps tomake it clear that in the event, for instance, of a dispute being handled by the pan-American Union, the United States Government would not claim to exercise a veto if she were a party to the dispute. There does not, in any case, seem tobe any reason why we should object to this provision.6. If, therefore, we favour the Presidents proposal, it is for consideration whether we should now so inform Marshal Stalin. There is a good deal to be said for our not intervening at this stage and leaving it to the Russians to raiseobjections if they will. Nor should we really be in a position to intervene insupport of the present proposal until we have at least considered the views of theDominions. Subject, therefore, to my colleagues.&apos; views, I recommend that thePrime Minster should inform President Roosevelt that we are attracted by his proposal and that, subject to the views of the Dominions, we should be preparedto support it; but that we feel it might be better for us not to express our viewbefore Marshal Stalin has expressed his.7. In point of fact it seems likely that, when Marshal Stalin does reply, hewill not commit himself altogether to the Presidents proposal but may suggestthat the experts should have another meeting to consider it, thereby leaving open the possibility of our all agreeing on something nearer the Russian point of view,e.g., Compromises &quot; B &quot; or &quot; C.&quot; It is also extremely likely that he will not agree to any final recommendations being made until the question of the12608   [28855]
constituent Soviet-Socialist Republics is settled.(see A.P.W. (44) 123). This lastis a question which obviously cannot be handled by experts, and it may thereforebe that, in spite of the Presidents obvious desire to settle this question before thenext meeting of Heads of Governments, it may be necessary to wait until thenbefore agreement can be reached on the whole question.A. E.Foreign Office, 18th December, 1944.The Earl of Halifax to Mr. Eden.(No. 6479.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, 5th December, 1944.******Following message from President to Marshal Stalin should be delivered tohim in person. (For Ambassador: This is for your personal and urgentattention) :-[Begins.&apos;] &quot;Iam requesting Ambassador Harriman to deliver this message to you and to discuss with you on my behalf the important subject of votingprocedure in the Security Council, since the prospects for an early meeting between us are still unsettled and because of my conviction, with which I am sureyou agree, that we must proceed as&apos; rapidly as possible in the calling of a generalUnited Nations Conference on the subject of the International organisation.Before the general conference can be convened, this and other questions will obviously have to be agreed between us. This matter is also being taken up withChurchill.&quot; (2) I now feel, after careful consideration, that the substance of thefollowing.-draft provision should be thoroughly satisfactory to everyoneconcerned : &quot; Proposal for Chapter on Security Council, Section C.&quot; C. Voting&apos;&apos; (1) Vote should be held by each member of the Security Council.&quot; (2) Procedural matters should be decided by the Security Council onan affirmative vote of seven members.&quot; (3) An affirmative vote of seven members, including concurring votes of the permanent members, should be required for decisions of the security council on all other matters : provided that the parties to a dispute shouldnot vote in decisions under Chapter 8, Section A, and under paragraph 1 of chapter 8, Section C.&quot; (3) In all Council decisions relating-to a determination of threat to peace,action for the removal of such threat, or suppression of aggression or otherbreaches of the peace, you will note that unanimity of the permanent membersof the Council will be required. As a practical matter, I can see that, if thecomplement of this resolution is to be feasible, such a provision is necessary andtherefore I am prepared to accept your Governments views in this respectexpressed in its memorandum presented at Dumbarton Oaks. This clearly means that each permanent member would always have a vote in decisions of this character.&quot; (4) In promoting voluntarily peaceful settlement of disputes, DumbartonOaks proposals at the same time also provide in Chapter 8, Section A, that theSecurity Council may employ judicial or other procedures of a recommendatorycharacter. If the recommendations of the Security Council are concurred in bythe permanent members, I am&apos;satisfied that procedures will be effective. I amalso convinced that if the Great Powers exercise moral leadership by acceptinga provision under which, in so far as such procedures are concerned, all partiesto a dispute should abstain from voting, and thus demonstrate their fidelity to members, not to claim for themselves a special position in this respect would, Iam convinced, strengthen their own position as principal guardians of future )peace and greatly enhance their moral prestige; at the same time, their vital interests would in no way be jeopardised, nor would it deviate from the essentialprinciple that the Great Powers must act unanimously in all decisions of theCouncil which affect their vital interests. I thought the whole plan, which mustnecessarily assign a special position to the Great Powers in the enforcement ofpeace, would certainly thereby be made far more acceptable to all other nations.
&quot; (5) Specific provisions for procedure on questions of this nature were notcontained either in the Soviet or American memorandum presented at DumbartonOaks, and our representatives there were not in a position to reach a definiteagreement on the matter. A way must be found by you and me for completing the work which they, on our behalf, have so well carried forward. Would yoube willing that there be held as soon as possible a meeting of representativesdesignated by you, Churchill, and myself, to work out a complete provision onthis question and to discuss, the necessary arrangements for the early convocationof a general conference of the United Nations if you are inclined to favour some such approach as -I now suggest to this problem of voting? &quot; [Ends.&quot;]2. In order that you can hand to Marshal Stalin both the English and russian texts of the Presidents foregoing message, we assume that you will wishto have a careful Russian translation made of it.3. Only two or three representatives of each of the three countries would participate in the contemplated meeting, which would be an informal one.Nothing, in other words, in the nature of a new convening of the Dumbarton Oaksconversations is contemplated. Although London might perhaps be an appropriate and convenient meeting place, we have, at present, no fixed ideasas to where the meeting should be held or as to just who the representatives would be.4. In support of Presidents views which necessarily are stated in restrictedcompass in the message itself, you may wish to present additional, observationsorally, or perhaps in a separate memorandum. The following are amongst theadditional considerations which impressed us, and you may use as you see fitany or all of them as representing the views of your Government.In all decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security, unanimity of thought and action on the part of the Great Powers is ofthe utmost importance. There will be the greatest inducement for the parties in dispute to arrive at inevitable peaceful settlements with the Great Powersunanimous in thought and in action and readily instantly and equally to employ,in behalf of peace and security, measures of enforcement when and as necessary.Conditions of more assured stability in international relations than have ever before [ ? group omitted: % beenj obtained in history should result from suchan atmosphere of harmony amongst the Great Powers, and general willingness to resort to measures of peaceful settlement. All States will look first to the major powers themselves, under these realisable conditions, to seek the peacefuladjustment or settlement of any &quot;differences in which they may be concerned, thusabiding by the obligations contained in the charter of the organisation. No more effective justification of the Great Powers&apos; special position as principal guardiansof the peace can be conceived than the voluntary undertaking by each of them,along with all other members of the organisation, to abstain from voting, in anycontroversy to which it may be a party, on procedures which mankind will view as an impartial examination of the controversy by the world&apos;s highest tribunal.That leadership of the Great Powers is to be based not alone upon resources,size and strength, but on those enduring qualifications of moral leadership whichcan raise the whole level of international relations throughout the world should thus be made further accentuated. It is in the interest of each Great Power aswell as of all the world to assure and enhance this leadership.5. We feel that our views are fully as much in the interest of the soviet union as in those of all other States, and we have great confidence in yourability to convince Marshal Stalin of their reasonableness. Although we would naturally be highly gratified to learn that Marshal Stalin agrees with our views,we do not feel, of course, that we are in any sense asking simply for a yes-or-no answer. Even if you are not entirely successful in persuading the Marshal atthis time to adopt the views expressed in the Presidents message as his own, we agree entirely with the view which you emphasised in Washington, that it isessential on this vital and significant matter to avoid any crystallisation of a negative attitude on the part of the Soviet Union, and to keep the issue open.
Mr. Eden to the Earl of Halifax [Washington).(No. 10311.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, 6th December, 1944.FOLLOWING sent by President to Prime Minister, telegram No. 666 of 5th November :  [Begins]In view of the fact that prospects for an early meeting between you,Marshal Stalin and myself are unsettled and because of my conviction, withwhich I am sure you agree, that we must move forward as quickly as possiblein the convening of a general conference of the United Nations on the subjectof international organisation, I&apos; am taking this means of placing before you my present views on the important subject of voting procedure in the security council. This and other questions will, of course, have to be agreed between usbefore the general conference will be possible. I am also taking up this matter with Marshal Stalin. ;I am certain that the following draft provision should be eminently satis-factory to everybody concerned : proposal for Section C of the chapter on theSecurity Council. C. Voting. 1. Each Member of the Security Council shouldhave one vote. 2. Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shouldbe made by an affirmative vote of seven Members. 3. Decisions of the security council on all other matters should be made by an affirmative vote of sevenMembers, including the concurring votes of the permanent Members : providedthat, in decisions under Chapter 8, Section A, and under paragraph 1 of Chapter 8,Section C; a party to a dispute should abstain from voting;.You will note that the proposal provides for the unanimity of the permanent members in all decisions of the Council which relate to a determination of a threat to the peace or to action for the removal of such a threat or for the suppression of aggression or other breaches of the peace. I am prepared to accept in this respect the view&apos; expressed by the Soviet Government in its memorandum on an inter-national security organisation presented at the Dumbarton Oaks Meeting. Thismeans, of course, that in decisions of this character the permanent Members would always have a vote. At the same time I am sure that the maintenance of the moralprestige of the Great Powers is an essential element in any successful system ofinternational co-operation. I am certain, therefore, that those Powers should not insist on exercising a veto in such judicial or quasi-judicial procedures as theinternational organisation may employ in promoting voluntary peaceful settlementof disputes. I am certain that willingness of the permanent members to abstain from the exercise of their voting rights on questions of this sort would immenselystrengthen their own position as the principal guardians of the future peace andwould make the whole plan far more acceptable to all nations.If you should be inclined to give favourable consideration to some suchapproach to the problem of voting in the Council, would you be willing that there be held as soon as possible a Meeting of representatives designated by you, byme and by Marshal Stalin to work out a complete provision on this question andto discuss the arrangements necessary for a prompt convening of a general United
