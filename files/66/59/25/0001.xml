THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  December 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 725.12th December, 1944. . !WAR CABINET.EXIT PERlvm^PPLICATIONS BY Dr. NEGRIN.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.Dr. Negrin, the former Republican Premier of Spain, in September applied for an exit permit to visit the Spanish political leaders in Mexico, and alsohis family in the United States. With the concurrence of the Foreign Office Iauthorised a permit for this purpose in accordance with the general policy ontravel to these destinations.2. Two weeks ago Dr. Negrin asked for facilities to go to Paris for a fewdays before returning to England en route for the United States. He wished toget&apos;&apos;&apos; personally in touch &apos;&apos; with his compatriots in France, and had obtained the promise of a visa from the French Ambassador for this purpose.3. In view of the present severe restrictions on travel to France, which is confined to journeys on urgent business of national importance, I consulted theForeign Secretary, who tells me that &quot;he is opposed to Dr. Negrin&apos;s visit andfeels that a visit would only be likely to &quot;have a disturbing effect on theexiled Spanish element in France, and this in turn would be likely to cause alarmin Spain as a possible recurrence of revolutionary disturbances and so strengthenGeneral Franco&apos;s position.&quot; *4. On the other hand, a refusal may be regarded by critics of the Govern-ment as an attempt to stifle legitimate political activity in the interest of democracy and against the Franco regime.5. On the whole, if the War Cabinet agree, I would be disposed to approve the application (especially as the French Ambassador has promised a French visa)on the grounds that Dr. Negrin is a responsible person and that we have at this time no need to fear the displeasure of General Franco on the grounds of theproposed visit.H. M.Home Office, S.W. 1, 12th December, 1944.[28808]
