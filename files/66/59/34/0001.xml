LOCAL government during THE PERIOD OF RECONSTRUCTIONINTRODUCTION.In answer to a Question in the House of Commons on the 3rd August, 1944,the Minister of Health replied: &quot; Various proposals relating to the reform of local government in Englandand Wales put forward by the Local Government Associations and receivedfrom other authoritative sources have been carefully considered. It is clear from these that there is no general desire to disrupt the existing structure of local government or to abandon in favour of some form of regional government the main features of the county and county borough system;and the Government do not consider that any case has been made out, for so drastic a change.&quot; On the other hand, the Government are satisfied that within the generalframework of the county and county borough system there is need and scope for improvements, and in particular for amending the machinery 01the Local Government Act, 1933, relating to adjustments of status,boundaries and areas. Before putting detailed proposals beforeParliament I propose to take advantage of the experience and knowledge ofthe Local Government Associations and for that purpose to open dis-cussions with these bodies as soon as may be. My intention would be, inthe light of these discussions, to lay before Parliament a general outline ofthe Government^ proposals before submitting actual legislative measures.&quot;This Paper is presented to Parliament in fulfilment of that promise andas a preliminary to the introduction of legislation in the course of the present session.The discussion with the Local Government Associations foreshadowed in the reply has now taken place. Although the representatives were not em-powered to bind their Associations, the frank exchange of views with persons of experience and weight in local government affairs has been of the greatestassistance to the Government, and has fortified them in their decision to presentthe proposals outlined in this Paper. These proposals are not to be regardedas decisions but as proposals which commend themselves to the Government.They are now made public in the hope that it will be possible to introduceearly legislation which will be largely agreed.One further point may be made by way of introduction. The use through-out the Paper of such terms as &quot; machinery &quot; and &quot; structure &quot; must not beallowed to obscure the fact that local government in this country is a livingorganism capable of adaptation to meet new conditions. Both members and officers of local authorities have given proof of this under the stress andstrain of two great wars. They have shown themselves capable of shoulder-ing with marked success varied and novel responsibilities. For this they have earned the gratitude of the nation, and there is no reason to doubt that theywill prove equally capable of dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction.For reasons which will appear later, the Government are satisfied that, sofar from there being any ground for fear that the work of democratic localgovernment may diminish, the real problem for local administrators is how to strengthen its framework to bear greater responsibilities and fulfil newtasks. The solution of this problem turns largely on the capacity and publicspirit of the persons who, as members and officers of local authorities, areprepared to devote their services to local government. If throughout thePaper emphasis is laid on the need for improving local government machinery,it should be understood that the Governments primary aim is to secure an
PART I.future of local government.The system of local government in England and Wales (outside london) consists of (a) a one-tier structure in the county boroughs, each ofwhich has an authority responsible for the administration of all localgovernment services in its area, and (fc) a two-tier structurej in the adminis-trative counties, responsibility for the various services within the countybeing allocated by statute to the county council or to the councils of &quot; county districts,&quot; that is, of non-county boroughs and urban and rural districts. Inthe case of certain services administered by the county district councils,notably those of housing and water supply, there has been a tendency in modern legislation to give to county councils some power of co-ordination and oversight coupled with powers of financial assistance. Throughout thewhole field provision exists, and is extensively used, for joint action by localauthorities of all types through the medium of Joint Boards or Joint Com-mittees where the nature of the service demands a wider unit of administration.Five years of war have already brought local government face to face with serious new problems. Many towns have suffered grave damage from enemy attack, and great difficulties have been caused by large-scale movements of population and by economic and financial disturbance. Local Authoritiesgenerally have been compelled to undertake new duties in particular, civil defence, evacuation schemes and the repair of war damage in addition to maintaining essential peace-time services, with depleted staffs and under the increasing strain which war imposes. As a consequence changes have beenmade to provide the co-ordination and central control which war conditions and a war-time economy make essential. When, for example, a city is ablazeit needs help from far as well as near to put out its fires; and so a national fire Service was created to meet the danger of air attack.The change from war to peace will bring to local authorities other problemsof a different order. For towns that have suffered severely from enemy attacksthere will be the great task of replanning and physical reconstruction. Housing* Cmd. 6502. f Cmd. 6515.t The functions of parish councils and parish meetings, though important in a limitedsphere, are not within the scope of this Paper.38378 a 2-.jn which by its fitness for its purpose will attract administratorsof the right type, will give them proper scope for their activities, and will ensure fruitful results.Scope of the Paper.It is impossible to attempt in this Paper a complete review of the localgovernment system of this country a matter which has filled the pages ofmany Blue Books or to describe in detail the numerous services administered by local government bodies. Several of these have been the subject of earlierWhite Papers, such as those on Health* and Water j or, as in the case ofEducation, have received the fullest examination and discussion in Parliamentitself. But before explaining the Governments specific proposals it may be useful to consider for a moment the part which local government will becalled upon to play in the post-war world and the reasons which have led the Government to believe that a fundamental alteration of the structure of local government is not at the present time either necessary or desirable.This will provide a background against which the Government&apos;s proposalscan be viewed in proper perspective.
authorities will have a heavy responsibility to discharge, and the Govern-ment&apos;s reconstruction programme will impose many new duties. In particular,local authorities will have new or greatly increased duties to perform underthe Education Act of this year, under the still more recent Planning legisla-tion and under the proposals for a comprehensive National Health Service.Quite apart from the number and size of the various services entrusted tolocal government, the close co-operation between the central government andlocal authorities which is envisaged in the White Paper on employment policy* will call for a high quality of administration and a flexible andresponsive organisation both centrally and locally if the aim of full employ-ment is to be achieved. In particular, the timing and execution of a pro-gramme of capital expenditure an essential part of the Government&apos;s policy-^is a matter in which local and public authorities of all types throughout theco,country will have an important part to play.The reasons which have led the Government to the view that the time isnot opportune for a general recasting of the local government structure havebeen stated in Parliament and were elaborated in a letter addressed inSeptember, 1943, by Sir William Jowitt, then Minister without Portfolio, tothe Association of Municipal Corporations and the County Councils Asso-ciatiomt Broadly, they may be stated in two propositions first, that thereis no general desire in local government circles for a disruption of the presentsystem, or any consensus of opinion as to what should replace it; and secondly,that the making of a change of this magnitude, which would by commonconsent have to be preceded by a full-dress inquiry, would be a processoccupying some years and would seriously delay the establishment of thenew or extended housing, educational, health and other services which form part of the Governments programme.As against this it may be and, indeed, has been said that the presentlocal government structure was not designed to bear the weight of these new and extended services and will prove inadequate; and that to establish the services in advance of a reconstruction of the system is to pour newwine into old bottles. This argument is usually based on two main con-contentions, both of which call for examination:  (1) that certain of the services, such as town and country planning and hospital services, need to be planned, and in some cases administered, overa wider area than a county or county borough; and(2) that the reconstruction programme will place an impossible burden on local government finance.WIDER ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS.Interest and apprehension on this subject have been aroused by one important war-time institution, the creation of civil defence regions and theappointment of Regional Commissioners. This change did not alter thesystem of local government itself. Its purpose and effect was not to alter, or transfer to the State, any of the functions of local authorities butto decentralise the machinery of Government Departments in relation to civil defence and other war-time services. The system was establishedbecause it was thought that conditions might arise in which it would notbe possible to maintain communications between the seat of central govern-ment and the rest of the country. Although, happily, these conditions havenot arisen, there is no doubt that the decentralised Government machinery* Cmd. 6527, see in particular Chap. v.t Sec Hansard, Vol. 392, Cols. 195-8.
I Qvjded by the regional system has proved an effective instrument to meetthe urgent needs of war and that the Commissioners have formed a valuablelink between the Government and local authorities. But there is no questionof maintaining the system in peace. Some Government Departments whetherresponsible for services directly administered or concerned with servicesadministered by local authorities will no doubt find it advantageous, or indeed necessary, to maintain and perhaps to develop their own localisedstaffs and offices; but it can be stated definitely that it is no part of theGovernment&apos;s policy in dealing with post-war reconstruction to perpetuate thesystem of Regional Commissioners.But, apart altogether from the needs and expedients of war, it has beenasked,&apos; &quot; If the new or enlarged services which form part of the reconstruc-uon programme call for planning or administration over wider areas, how isthat compatible with the present local government structure ? &quot;There are various alternative ways in which it would be possible to planor administer over wider areas services which cannot be planned or ad-ministered efficiently within a single county or county borough.* The alter-natives include nationalisation, regionalisation and the creation of joint authorities for planning or for executive purposes.Transfer of Functions.As regards nationalisation, fears have been widely expressed that there isa growing tendency to divest local government of its responsibilities by transferof functions to the State.In actual fact the only permanent transfers of functions from local authori-ties to the State during the last decade are those made by the UnemploymentAct, 1934, and the Old Age and Widows&apos; Pensions Act, 1940, by which,with general approval in local government circles, the maintenance of theable-bodied unemployed and the supplementation of old age and widows&apos;pensions were vested in the Assistance Board, and by three Agricultural Acts.The last mentioned Acts provided for the establishment of a NationalVeterinary Service and a National Agricultural Advisory Service and forthe transfer to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of certain functionsrelating to conditions in which milk is produced on the farm. In addition,by the Trunk Roads Act, 1936, a small mileage of county roads was con-verted into trunk roads and placed under the direct responsibility of theMinister of Transport.The Government are not prepared to rule out altogether the possibility of transferring certain other functions, if on merits a good case can be shown for this course. Some extension of the system of trunk roads, for example,has already been foreshadowed; and the White Paper on Social Insurancefproposes to transfer to the State certain of the residual functions of publicassistance. Moreover, the Government have at present under consideration thefuture organisation of the National Fire Service and certain of the publicutility services. These latter are in a rather different category from the other local government services and their control is at present fortuitously divided between municipal and private enterprise.The Government are however opposed to any general policy of nationalisingservices hitherto regarded as essentially local.* It is not proposed to deal in this Paper with the corresponding problem of servicesnow administered within a county by the county district councils. It may suffice topoint out that, in addition to the alternative courses mentioned in the text, there arethe obvious possibilities, first, of transferring the service to the county council and secondly, of introducing the county council as a co-ordinating element (as has been done with success in the sphere of town and country planning, housing, and water supply)and empowering it to give financial assistance.t Cmd. 6550, paxas. 159-161.38378 A 3
Nor do they believe that a solution is to be found in the creation of regional authorities. This system would involve the establishment of directly electedbodies to administer certain services over areas larger than those of counties and county boroughs, and would introduce a two-tiered system in county boroughs and possibly a three-tiered system in counties. This is a matter onwhich the Local Government Associations have shown a unanimity whichis in marked contrast to the diversity of their views on other possible linesof development.Joint Authorities.The Government consider, therefore, that where co-ordination of services between two or more areas, whether counties or county boroughs, is necessary,it should be  sought by  the established procedure  of Joint Boards orJoint Committees.   To this  procedure there are,   admittedly,   objections objections which are well known and need not be described in anydetail in this Paper.   Briefly, Joint Boards are open to the criticism thatthey are not directly elected and that they must rely for their finance uponprecepting, a system which has been said to weaken financial responsibility.Joint Committees constituted solely for the plarining of services are opento the criticism that it is unsatisfactory to divorce such planning fromexecutive authority.   Moreover, it can be argued with force that, as the needfor wider planning and better co-ordination is more fully realised, the fieldin which joint action is required increases, and there is consequently a danger of creating a multiplicity of ad hoc authorities covering a variety of areas and services.    The Government have no desire to underrate these objections; but they do not believe that the difficulties are so great as to warrantdelay in the working out of the reconstruction programme.    The numberof services in which joint planning or joint action is essential is, after all,limited, and where in the development of the programme combined action isrequired, it should be possible to find acceptable means of ensuring it.   Toproceed in this way does not rule out ultimate integration of the joint bodies in any area into a single compendious unit, if experience should show this tobe desirable.It is for these reasons, and after considering the various suggestions ofthe Local Government Associations, that the Government believe it to be inexpedient to contemplate drastic innovations, such as the constitution of regional bodies, in re-shaping the local government system to fit post-warneeds. They prefer to rely on the existing structure based on the county and county borough, with appropriate machinery, where necessary, for combinedaction.local government finance.The fear that the Governments reconstruction programme will place an impossible burden on local rates has been freely expressed often, indeed, bycritics who simultaneously deplore the alleged encroachment by the centralgovernment on the domain of local authorities. It is fair at the outset topoint out that the increase in the general level of rates during the war hasbeen small in comparison with the increase in national taxation, and that the wholesale shifting of burdens from the ratepayer to the taxpayer is noultimate solution. But, in fact, is there any real ground for the fearsexpressed? They are due in part to the general rise in prices, wages and salaries which will make pre-war services more expensive in future, but onthe other hand will commonly increase the money incomes of ratepayers. Inthe main they have been aroused by the anticipated cost of those new and expanded services which will fall to be administered by local authorities. Itcannot be denied that this cost will be substantial. Local authorities will beresponsible for greater activities in the fields of education and housing, and
&quot;for new spheres of work in connection with the health services and the recon-struction of cities and towns.It is impossible at the present moment to say definitely what the total increase in the money to be spent by local authorities is likely to be in five orten years time it depends too much on the course of prices and on the rateof progress of the new schemes but the tentative estimates given for two ofthe services, i.e., education and health, indicate the possible magnitude. Thepre-war expenditure of local authorities on education was  93.8m.; in theFinancial Memorandum attached to ithe recent Education Bill the post-war expenditure was estimated, on the information then available, at  129m. risingafter soms years to  203m. The pre-war expenditure of local authorities onthe health services was about  41m.; the post-war expenditure under thenew scheme has been estimated at  92m. at the outset.Mitigation of Financial Burdens.Local authorities axe naturally concerned less with the total amount of money which they will have to spend, than with the amount which they will have toobtain from their ratepayers. Thus their fears really represent a doubt whetherthe present methods of mitigating the burdens on ratepayers will suffice in thefuture.These methods are: (i) a system of direct grants to each local authority in aid of its expendi-ture on certain specific services;(ii) the General Exchequer Grant, commonly called the Block Grant,which is not related to any particular service, but is a form of supplementaryincome to local authorities;(iii) the acceptance by the Central Government of the liability for administration of services previously borne by local authorities.The direct grants may be percentage grants either at a flat rate (usually 50per cent.) for all local authorities, or at varying rates graded in favour of the poorer authorities or they may be unit grants such as the subsidy per houseunder the Housing Acts. Their effect is directly to reduce the cost to therate payers of the service which is grant-aided. Thus, in the case of the esti-mate for the education service quoted above, although the total cost of theservice was assumed to rise from  93.8m. to  129m., the education granton this expenditure would rise from  45.5m. to  71m. Similarly, while thetotal money to be spent by local authorities on the new health services would rise from about  41m. to  92m., the direct health grants would rise from about   m. to about  44m.The General Exchequer Grant or Block Grant is a grant distributedlargely on the basis of the relative needs of local authorities, as determined bya statutory formula. The total amount to be distributed and the basis of dis-tribution are recalculated every five years, the amount increasing as the totalexpenditure of the local authorities increases. There should have been arecalculation for the five years beginning in 1942, but this was impossibleowing to the war and, by an Act passed in 1941, the existing distribution(totalling  46m.) has been stabilised until a-hew Act is passed. Under thepresent statutes the annual amount of the Block Grant for each period offive years is 22-I per cent, of the total expenditure of all local authorities which was met out of the rates and the Block Grant in the last year but oneof the preceding five years. The effect of the grant can be most simplyrepresented by picturing the Exchequer as a ratepayer paying his rates on an assessment equivalent to 22J per cent, of the whole rateable value of thecountry. Hence, whenever any grant-aided service is started or an existinggrant-aided service is expanded, the Exchequer is called on not only to pay
8 ,the specific grant, but also on the next review to bear 22^ per cent, of theremainder of the cost of that service.Examples of services for which liability has been accepted by the CentralGovernment have already been given and, as previously stated, it is theGovernment&apos;s intention to take over an increased mileage of trunk roads andto relieve local authorities of a further portion of the burden of public assist-ance.The system described above provides a very flexible instrument, capable of adjustment to meet new conditions. This is especially true of the Block. Grant. Adjustments will certainly be needed, in the light of post-war develop-ments, and these should take into account, on the one hand, increases in the over-all cost of services and, on the other hand, any transfer of liabilities.Modifications affecting both the total amount of the grant and the formula of distribution can be introduced as and when the material factors become known.The existing machinery can thus be adapted, without any fundamental changes,to meet the problems arising from the expansion of locally-administeredservices with which local authorities generally are likely to be confronted inthe near future.Special Problems in Particular Areas.There are, however, financial problems of a different order to be faced inparticular areas. Certain authorities have had their financial resources soheavily depleted during the war (as a result of enemy action, large-scaleevacuation, or other war circumstances) as to involve serious embarrassment.These authorities are already being assisted, and until their normal prosperityreturns some measure of financial assistance appropriate to their needs must continue. Moreover, the Town and Country Planning Act, 1944, provides forspecial assistance from the Exchequer to local planning authorities in areasof extensive war damage during the first two years (and on certain conditions for longer periods) after they have acquired land that requires redevelopmentas a whole or is needed for the &quot; overspill &quot; of population or industry.But the authorities of some other areas have problems of longer standingwhich, in so far as they may continue, will merit special consideration.Financial difficulties in the sphere of local government often, if not generally,have their roots in, and indeed are a reflection of, local economic con-ditions. The only radical cure for these difficulties lies in a permanentimprovement of those conditions. Pending such improvement, therewill be a need for special measures in relation to the finance of localgovernment. Judged by any of the available tests level of rates, ratescollected per head of population, rateable value per head some local govern-ment areas must be regarded as &quot; poor &quot; areas, after full allowance has beenmade for such factors as an unduly low level of assessment for rates. Thedifficulties of these areas may in part be mitigated by the spreading of thecharges for certain services over wider areas than hitherto, by amalgamation of areas as suggested later in Part II of -this Paper, and by improvements inthe machinery of assessment which are now under consideration by the Govern-ment and the Local Government Associations. But the Government recognisethat such measures can be no panacea for the problem of the &quot; poor &quot; areas.Here again, in their view, adjustment of the distribution of Exchequer grantsoffers the best prospect of alleviating the difficulties; and reference maybe made in this connection to the assurance* given on the 3rd October, 1944,by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that a general overhaul of the financial relations between the Exchequer and local authorities will be undertaken assoon as the necessary data are available, and that it will be carried out with adefinite bias in favour of the poorer authorities.* Hansard, Vol. 403, Col. 752.
PART II.PROCEDURE FOR ADJUSTMENT OF LOCAL government areas.The system of counties (with county districts within the county) and county boroughs cannot be static. It must be capable of adaptation by redrawingof frontiers to meet changing conditions; and the adjustments and alterationsmust be such as to make, as far as possible, areas of each type satisfactoryunits of administration. For carrying out adjustments, where needed, theremust be effective machinery for periodic review. That machinery mustfulfil certain conditions. It must command public confidence; it must worksmoothly and expeditiously; it should be such as to reduce to the minimum the cost of making the adjustments which has been all too high in the past;-and it must ensure that all proposals affecting a county, whether for adjustingcounty districts or altering the boundaries between county and county or county and county borough, are properly correlated and not considered in isolation. How best to secure this is discussed in the remaining sectionsof this Paper.The principle of adjusting local government units from time to time is of long standing. For centuries the growth in population and importance of a town has been recognised by the grant from the Crown of a Charter ofIncorporation establishing a new local government unit. In more recenttimes, provision for these adjustments has been made in all the major localgovernment statutes.Procedure Between 1888 and 1929.In order to explain why an overhaul of the machinery of adjustment hasbecome a matter of urgent importance, it is necessary to review very briefly the course of events in this field since the framework of modern localgovernment was laid down by the Local Government Act, 1888.By that Act, which established 62 administrative counties and 61 county boroughs in England and Wales, the Local Government Board (now theMinister of Health) was empowered on the application of a county council to alter the boundaries of the county, to unite it with any other county or countyborough, to divide the county, and to alter any local government area partlysituate in the county. Except in the case of the last mentioned power, orders made for these purposes were provisional only and required Parliamentaryconfirmation. Similarly, the Board could, on the application of a borough council, confer county borough status, alter the boundaries of the borough,unite it with another borough or include an urban or rural district within it,or, in the case of a county borough, unite the borough with the county. Inall these cases the order required Parliamentary confirmation and the right toapply for county borough status was limited to boroughs having a populationof 50,000 or upwards. Corresponding alterations could be made in the case of urban and rural districts and parishes by order made by the county counciland confirmed by the Board.It is worth remarking that the Bill for the Act of 1888 as originally intro-duced provided for 10 county boroughs only. The increase of this number to 61 during its passage through Parliament radically changed the conception of the scheme.In the period between 1889 and the end of the last war, the extension ofexisting county boroughs and the creation of new ones proceeded at a rate which aroused fears for the future of county government. The countycouncils found that their territories were being whittled away piecemeal, andthat session after session they were exposed to further demands on the partof the large towns.   This conflict of interest between the counties and county
boroughs was the principal cause of the setting up in 1922 of the Royal Corn-mission on Local Government under the Chairmanship of Lord Onslow.Evidence tendered to that body showed that since 1889 the number ofcounty boroughs had been increased from 61 to 82 and that the effect wasto place under the jurisdiction of county borough councils, and remove from that of county councils, areas amounting to about 100,000 . acres, a population of about 1,300,000, and about  6Jm. of rateable value. The effectof county borough extensions in the same period was to transfer from countiesto county boroughs 250,000 acres, a population of 1,700,000 and some  8m. ofrateable value. In relation to the 27 counties affected, these changes, taken together, had on average reduced- their population by 22.88 per cent, andtheir rateable value by 20.80 per cent.*The subject was discussed by the Commission at great length in their first Report, which contained a series of unanimous recommendations.&apos; Effect was given to these by the Local Government (County Boroughs andAdjustments) Act, 1926. The Act abolished the power of the Minister ofHealth to create a new county borough by Provisional Order and forbadeapplications to Parliament for that purpose if the population of the boroughdid not exceed 75,000. It further provided that (except where the proposals were agreed) county borough extensions could be effected only by private Actand not, as previously, by Provisional Order.Partly no doubt as a result of this legislation and partly owing to the trend of opinion reflected in the report of the Royal Commission, the movement for county borough extension slackened, and only one new county borough(Doncaster) has since then been created.County Reviews under Act of 1929.Following upon a Second Report of the Royal Commission f, presented in 1928, the Local Government Act, 1929, introduced a new system fordealing with the adjustment of county districts and parishes. The new procedure followed the broad outline of the old, the initiative lying withthe county council and the final decision with the Minister, but with theimportant distinction that it recognised that the process of adjustment oughtto be undertaken systematically at specified intervals rather than piecemeal.Accordingly, while the old procedure was left on foot to deal with exceptional cases, every county council was required as soon as might be after thepassing of the Act to initiate a review of its county and to submit to theMinister its proposals for alterations of status and boundaries of county districts and parishes. The Minister was empowered, as before, to approveby order the proposals as they stood or to modify them. If objection were taken by a borough council to any proposal affecting the borough, theMinisters order was to be provisional only and to require confirmation byParliament, but this provision did not apply to the first review. The Actfurther provided that a ten-year interval should elapse between any tworeviews; and that, at the end of that interval, each county council shouldhave a discretion to institute a further review, or might be required by theMinister to do so.JThe first series of reviews under the Act of 1929 took place between theyears 1931 and 1936, though in three important counties the proceedings wereprolonged to 1937. The general effect of these reviews was to reduce thenumber of urban districts from 827 to 572 and of rural districts from 779 to* First Report (Cmd. 2506) paras. 372-377.t Cmd. 3213.t The provisions of the Acts of 1888 and 1929 on.this subject are now to be found in88.^140-146 oi the Local Government Act, 1933.
476. The success of the procedure was admittedly uneven. Some countycouncils undertook the work with vigour, and the resulting system of county districts and parishes in these counties was satisfactory and probably calls for little, if any, revision on a second review. Others met with strong opposition from interests concerned to maintain the status quo, and theproposals put forward were inadequate. The procedure laid down by theAct empowered the Minister, if dissatisfied with the county councils pro-posais, to initiate further proposals himself; but practical experience hasshown that to effect radical improvements at this stage of the proceedingsis very difficult.Suspension of Alterations During the War.Further adjustment of local government areas, whether by way of countyreview or otherwise, is at present barred by section 6 of the Local elections and Register of Electors (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1939 a temporaryAct which has been extended from time to time and will expire on the 31stMarch, 1945 - Similarly, during the war there have been no applications toParliament for Bills dealing with county borough -extensions or the creationof new county boroughs, though this suspension of activity has been basedon common consent and is not the result of any legal or constitutional bar.Thus, since the completion of the first series of reviews under the Act of 1929,there has been a suspension of alterations of county districts, apart froma few sporadic cases. And it is to be noted that, during the period of thosereviews, the fact that private legislation for dealing with county boroughboundaries was at a low ebb enabled a county council to proceed with itsreview without any serious fear that the administrative county itself wouldbe changed in shape and extent by another procedure operating simul-taneously.   This situation has now been transformed.It may be expected that as soon as the Act of 1939 expires a number ofcounty councils will consider undertaking their second county review. Inother cases the Minister may feel it to be in the public interest to call upon them to do so. Moreover, there is reason to&apos; believe that a substantial numberof applications may be made to Parliament before long for Bills extendingcounty borough boundaries and probably also for uniting smaller areas(non-county boroughs and urban districts) with a view either to creating asingle area having the population necessary for county borough status or toforming a more effective barrier against encroachment by adjoining county boroughs. The urgency of the case of the war-damaged towns was strongly pressed in the course of - debates on the recent Town and Country planning act. The redevelopment of these towns no doubt forms a special problem;but there are other areas which will put forward similar claims as not lessurgent, basing themselves on existing conditions, including an &quot; overspill &quot;of population which has already occurred.The Government are convinced that in these circumstances the presentsystem for adjusting areas and status will not fulfil the conditions outlined inthe first paragraph of this Part of the Paper. In particular, if the existing lawstands, the two procedures of county review and county borough extensionRill will operate simultaneously and with little or no means of correlatingdecisions. A county council may well find itself under a duty to recast thelocal government units in its county while under the immediate threat of having the county itself dismembered or, at best, with no assurance thatthe county will remain intact.The Governments proposals aim at avoiding a situation of this kind bydevising a procedure under which all proposals for adjustments-whether ofthe boundaries of counties and county boroughs or of county districts_will be
examined by a single body, the decisions of this body being made subject, mappropriate cases, to Parliamentary review. A secondary object is to devise a procedure free from the disadvantages which in the view of the Royal Com-mission were inherent in the system of borough extension by ProvisionalOrders made by the Minister.PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENTBOUNDARY COMMISSION.To achieve both these objects it is proposed to introduce a measure forthe establishment of a Local Government Boundary Commission and to investthis body with powers embracing those of the county council and Ministerof Health relating to county reviews under the Local Government Act, 1933.*Further, the creation and extension of county boroughs and, in propercases, the reduction of the status of a small county borough and the unionof contiguous county boroughs and also of some of the smaller administrativecounties would be within the scope of the Commission. But the exerciseof these latter powers would be subject to safeguards. Ministerial and parliamentary, which are discussed later in the Paper.As already indicated, the functions of the Commission would be executive and not advisory, and it is contemplated that it would be a small body ofnot more than five members and would be provided with a secretary andother staff, including assistant commissioners whose duties would includeholding local inquiries.The Government recognise that to entrust powers of so wide and importanta character to a body of Commissioners not directly responsible to parliament is a drastic proposal. They intend, however, to provide two safeguards whichwill in their view secure the constitutional position without unduly hamperingthe discharge of the Commissioners&apos; functions. These two safeguards are(a) a power for the Minister to give the Commissioners &quot; general directions&quot;as to the exercise of their powers, and (b) a provision under whichthe more important decisions taken by the Commissioners will be submittedto the Minister of Health in the form of draft orders and will be subject to parliamentary review.   Both of these call for examination.GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO COMMISSION.Form and scope of directions__The general directions would be formaldocuments which would be laid before both Houses of Parliament and whichwould require to ibe approved by affirmative resolutions of both Houses. Itwould be open to the Minister by a similar procedure to give fresh directionsfrom time to time and to modify existing directions. The precise scope of the directions would demand careful consideration and the points which could usefully be dealt with will no doubt emerge more fully in the course ofdiscussion of the present proposals and, indeed, in the actual administrationof the scheme. But, with a view to focussing discussion and indicating thegeneral conception which the Government have in mind, it may be useful tosuggest some matters on which guidance on broad issues could with advantage be given.Size of areas Since the main object of the county review procedure isto secure local government units of such a shape and size and with such* This statement requires one minor qualification. &apos; It will probably be.convenient tomaintain the existing machinery for tbe alteration of parish boundaries and to entrustthat function to the Boundary Commission only where an alteration is consequent on the alteration of the boundaries of a larger area of which the parish forms part.
( 13financial resources as to provide the foundation of a satisfactory administra-tion, some general guidance under this head might be given and the Com-missioners might be directed to pay regard to such factors as population,rateable value, product of a penny rate and so forth. It may well bedesirable to go further than this, though to what extent is more debatable.Parliament has itself twice fixed a figure as the minimum populationjustifying application for county borough status. It has been argued insome quarters that minimum figures, whether in terms of population or offinancial resources, might be fixed for other types of local authority. Asagainst this, it is said that conditions vary within the widest limits; thatfactors such as means of access to a suitable centre play an essential partin determining the shape and size of a suitable local government area; andthat no hard and fast rules can be laid down. The Government believe thatit would be practicable to indicate certain minimum requirements in theabsence of which there would at least be a presumption that the area wasnot a suitable unit for local government purposes. It is not suggested thatany such minimum requirements as might be appropriate to the creation ofnew units should necessarily affect the status of existing authorities. It hasalways been recognised in the latter case that there are additional considera-tions.Linking town and country__Another matter on which guidance might properly be given to the Commission is that of the linking of town and country areas within an administrative county. In the rural counties ofEngland and Wales, it is common to find small country towns, many of themboroughs with ancient Charters, surrounded by a rural district oftenof large extent. When, as a result of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835,the boundaries of the old boroughs were re-cast by the Boundary Commissionof 1837, it was the policy of the Commission to draw a sharp distinctionbetween town and country and to limit the borough boundaries closely to theformer. The arguments in favour of this course were ably set out in theirReport.* and were no doubt valid in the circumstances of the day. Buttimes have changed, and the conceptions of 1837 have lost much of theirvalidity since the introduction of motor transport which brings the town andits amenities within the reach of the countryside. Moreover, the deratingof agricultural land and buildings has largely destroyed the argument that to combine town and country areas to form a single unit would place an unfairburden on the countryman by making him contribute to the cost of services which he could not enjoy.The Government consider that the time has come for a different approach to this subject and for a recognition of the fact that the interests of thecountry town and its surrounding countryside are not diverse but com-supplementary, and they contemplate that in a number of cases the enlargement of the limits of a country town to include some surrounding territory mayhe desirable. Such an enlargement would not affect the status or charter of a borough. The Government do not underrate the practical difficultiesin the way of merging the two types of community in a single localgovernment unit. The composition of - the authority to administer thenew area would require careful adjustment so as to reflect fairly the differentelements; and there must be some give and take on such matters as the times of meetings, in which a difference of practice between town and country is common. But these are matters that admit of arrangement. On the broadissue, the Government believe that this policy will make for an integration of town and country with resulting advantages to both.* See Report of Commission on Municipal Corporation Boundaries, 1837, Part I, page 4.
Creation and extension of county boroughs. This is a matter in which the formulation of any general directions is difficult. The problem, though familiar,is one which under post-war conditions is likely to assume new aspects. as already stated, the Royal Commission on Local Government examined thesubject exhaustively between 1923 and 1929. Their first report, which is inthe main occupied by a precis of the evidence tendered to them and a state-ment of their conclusions on this subject, contains no fewer than 487 pages.The conclusion was that it is not practicable to find any general formula andthat a decision to grant or disallow an extension of boundaries must always be one of a balance of advantage. Iln most cases there will necessarily be someconflict of interest between the borough and the adjoining county areas andit must be left for the body with which the decision rests to strike a properbalance, weighing advantages and disadvantages as best they can.Before reaching this conclusion the Commission examined a number of factors to which, under current practice, weight was attached, such as com-munity of interest between the borough seeking extension and the areas whichthe extension would absorb, the administrative record of the borough and ofthose areas, the lay-out of sewers and control of certain public utility services,and so forth. Their general attitude, with which the Government are disposed to agree, was that it is easy to give too much weight to individual factors ofthis kind. A member of the Commission made the point that &quot; the rightway of looking at these matters &quot; (i.e., Borough Extensions) &quot; is not through a drain-pipe &quot;; and the development of public utility services often turnson considerations not particularly relevant to the re-shaping of local govern-ment areas. So also in the sphere of finance, it is doubtless right that con-sideration should be given to the plea that rateable values which have been created by the efforts of the borough or its inhabitants, or will be so created as aresult of planned development, should be secured to the borough. But aplea of this kind must be viewed in a wider context. The aim must be to securethe best possible design of local government areas in the future and not merely to adjudicate on the merits of conflicting claims. This point of view isreinforced by two further considerations.In the past, applications for county borough extensions have not usuallybeen made until the area claimed has been at least partially developed.One of the difficulties that has confronted the county council whose territoryis invaded is the disruption of services, in particular school services,already established. But a system of organised dispersal of large bodies of population presents a new situation, since an application for boroughextension at the planning stage can be examined with an eye to thefuture rather than the past. Moreover, if the case proves to be one inwhich an extension of the borough is justified, the operation can beeffected with much less disturbance to county and county districtfinance and administration, if it is timed to take place while the develop-men-t is still in the future and the necessary services still remain tobe built up. Such a course has the additional advantage of securing that most or all of the services of the area are from the outset planned by theauthority which will administer them. On the other hand, the new conception of dispersal may well involve the development of new centres at a distance from the parent borough, and this in itself disposes of the idea that the borough has an automatic right to retain jurisdiction over its former inhabitantsby extending its boundaries.Combinations for specific purposes__The union of two or more county districts is obviously not a universal remedy for financial and administrativeweakness. In the sparsely populated agricultural counties physical conditions must often make it impracticable to form county districts in which the normal
requirements of population and rate product can be secured. A partialsolution of this difficulty may sometimes be found in establishing combinationsof authorities for specific purposes -housing, water supply, and so forth.These possibilities are likely to emerge in the course of local inquiries heldon behalf of the Commission, and it is proposed that the Commission should beempowered to bring them to the notice of the Minister and, if necessary, to defer making any final decision on the area until some conclusion on thequestion of combinations for special purposes has been reached.Intervals between alterations. The Government accept the general principle,embodied in the Act of 1929, that the normal interval between alterations oflocal government areas should be not less than ten years. They believe thatthis will make for stability and enable local authorities to make long-termplans with some assurance that they will be allowed to mature without the disturbance which results from alteration of areas. But exceptional casesmay arise by reason, for example, of a sudden increase of population or thecreation of a new town in the intervening period, and it was no doubt forthis reason that the power to make alterations from time to time has remainedon the statute book. It seems that this point might conveniently be dealtwith by giving the Commission a direction in effect forbidding it to entertainfurther applications in respect of an area during the ten-year period, unlesschanges of a quite exceptional character were shown to have occurred.REVIEW  OF ORDERS  BY PARLIAMENT.The various procedures under the existing law for adjusting the status andareas of local authorities have already been described.It is proposed to maintain, broadly, the existing distinction between orders which do and those which do not come before Parliament by providing that orders creating or affecting the status or boundaries of county boroughs andcounties shall require confirmation by Parliament, but that in all other casesthe orders should, be final.This proposal involves one change in the law. As already mentioned, underthe Local Government Act, 1933, a non-county borough could, except in thecase of the first review, insist that an order affecting the borough should go before Parliament. The distinction between non-county boroughs andufban districts is a matter of historical rather than of practical importance and does not, in the view of the Government, justify according to boroughsa privilege in this respect which is not shared by urban districts.It is contemplated that in those cases in which the Commissioner&apos;s decisionrequires Parliamentary confirmation, the Commission would embody thedecision (whether it gave affect wholly or in part or not at all to proposals submitted to them) in a draft order which they would transmit to theMinister of Health for submission to Parliament. The draft order wouldbe accompanied by a statement describing shortly the course of the pro-ceedings at the local inquiry, with a summary of the views presented by thepersons or bodies appearing at the inquiry and the considerations which led the Commission to reach their decision. The precise form of the Parlia-mentary procedure has not been worked out in detail but it is the Govern-menfs intention to secure that while the control of Parliament over thepolicy of the order is maintained the procedure should not necessitate theexpenditure of effort and money which would be involved in duplicatingthe detailed investigation of the facts already carried out by the Commission&quot;.
PROCEDURE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOUNDARY COMMISSION.The Commission would normally direct the holding of a local inquiry as a preliminary to their decision. These inquiries would be held either by membersof the Commission or by Assistant Commissioners.The procedure contemplated would be broadly on these lines: (i) The   Commission  would   have   a  general  duty   to   review   eachgeographical county that is, the administrative county with its county boroughs-^and to determine whether there was a prima facie case for holding- a local inquiry with a view to making adjustments.  The review would includeconsideration of the boundaries of the county.(2) Before undertaking this review, the Commission would notify theMinister and the county council; and, if either of these requested that alocal inquiry should be held, the Commission would be bound to directan inquiry. The Commission would similarly notify each county borough council, and any of these councils could make a binding request for a local inquiry with a view to the extension of its boundaries. A similar opportunitywould be given to the council of a non-county borough, whose populationexceeded any limit that might be prescribed in connection with countyborough status, to apply to the Commission for a consideration of thatissue. Apart from this, it is not contemplated that the council of a non-county borough or urban or rural district should be empowered as of rightto call upon the Commission to hold an inquiry; but it would beopen to them to make representations to the county council or to theMinister, or to both, to the effect that some adjustment of their boundarieswas desirable.(3) Subject to these requirements, the Minister would be empowered togive the Commission directions as to the order in which they- were toproceed with their reviews. He might, for example, direct the Commissionto give early and immediate consideration to the questions of boundaryadjustment that may arise from the requirements of local authorities in areas of extensive war-damage.(4) Orders and draft orders embodying decisions of the Commission would include the consequential and ancillary provisions usually found in orders and private Bills dealing with adjustments of boundaries.(5) The Commission would be required to submit to the Minister anannual report of their proceedings, and this would be presented to Parlia-ment.FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS.Both the Local Government Act of 1888 and that of 1894 provided for making adjustments of the property and liabilities of local authorities whichwere consequential on a transfer of territory. By a later statute, the LocalGovernment (Adjustments) Act, 1913, provision was made for the payment to a local authority of a sum &apos;&apos; in respect of any increase of burden which willproperly fall on the ratepayers of the area of that authority in meeting thecost incurred by that authority in the execution of any of their powers and duties as a consequence of any alteration of boundaries . . . &quot;. Follow-ing a recommendation made by the Royal Commission on Local Government,the formula was in some respects altered by the Local Government (county boroughs and Adjustments) Act, 1926. The existing law is now set outin the Fifth Schedule to the Local Government Act, 1933.    The broad
principle remains the same, viz., that there shall be a financial adjustmentbetween the authority which acquires and the authority which loses territory,based on the difference between the rate-income derived from that territory and the cost of services rendered to the inhabitants. It has from time to time been alleged both by counties and by county boroughs that in practice thesystem does not operate fairly as between the ratepayers of the area which iscurtailed and of the area which is enlarged. There is little information asto the practical working of the system, for the reason that agreements are almost universally reached without recourse to arbitration and consequentlyno established practice of arbitrators has grown up. Thus it is difficult tosay whether or not the criticisms heard from both sides may be regardedas mutually destructive; but the matter is one on which the Governmentwould welcome practical suggestions for the amendment of the law, if amend-ment is necessary.In one important respect conditions have altered since 1888. Up tothe end of the last war the spread of population from the.large townswas, in the main, a matter of individual decision. It is broadly true to say that the fringe of a spreading population was likely to include a large proportion ^ of houses of high rateable value. Under modern conditions the development may often assume a different form, and thebulk of houses in a transferred territory may well be working-class houses built by the municipality. It is impossible to say with precision whether such houses &quot;pay their way &quot;, since much depends on the circum-stances of the individual families inhabiting them; but it has beenroughly estimated that the rates paid by the occupier of a house of less than about  30 rateable value are unlikely to cover the cost to the rates of theservices which he and his family enjoy. Thus, if a development consistedsolely of working-class houses, with an average rateable value of say /20or less, the rate burden imposed by the new services required would largelyexceed the additional produce of rates. Such an unmixed development doesnot, however, occur in practice. Houses of higher value, shops, cinemaspublic houses and the like will also probably be found in the area and theultimate loss or gain may well remain a matter of doubt.EXPENSE OF LOCAL INQUIRIES.Much discussion took place before the Royal Commission on the subjectof the expense involved in the then existing procedure for creating or extendingcounty boroughs by way of Provisional Order. Criticisms were directed inpart to the costs incurred in the employment of counsel and expert witnessesat the local inquiry held by the Minister, and in part to the risk of a doubleor even treble expenditure if, after an elaborate local inquiry, the order werecontested in one or in both of the Houses of Parliament and the same issues were examined a second and possibly even a third time. One of the sub-sidiary reasons which led the Royal Commission to prefer a direct applicationto Parliament to procedure by Provisional Order was undoubtedly the avoid-ance of the risk of multiplying inquiries.As already stated, the Government contemplate that the normal procedure of the Commissioners will be by way of local inquiry. Large interests are at stake, and deep feelings may well be aroused in proceedings whose results mustoften be to merge the identity of two or more local bodies or to transfer large areas from the jurisdiction of one local authority to that of another. A public inquiry on the spot is unquestionably the best method of assuring the contend-ing interests that their claims have been fairly weighed in the balance.   None
the less, the Government feel no doubt that, in the circumstances with wh..athe country will find itself confronted after the war, every effort must be madeto reduce to a minimum the expenditure on these matters both of money andof the time of senior local government officers and others whose energies willbe fully taxed in other directions. While they agree with the Royal commission that it would not be right to forbid by statute the employment of counsel orexpert witnesses, they believe that inquiries could be substantially shortenedand simplified, and that a practice of preliminary conference and negotiation between representatives of the various authorities concerned (in whichexperienced officers of the Ministry of Health could usefully participate) might go far to achieve this by clarifying the issues and, in many cases, securing alarge measure of agreement.TWO SPECIAL PROBLEMS.1. COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX^The County of Middlesex presents a special problem. The county, whichbefore the war had a population of 2,000,000, consists&apos; of 15 non-county boroughs, in 9 of which the population (on the figures given in the RegistrarGeneral&apos;s Statistical Review for 1940) exceeds 75,000, and 11 urban districts,in one of which the population exceeds this figure. There are no rural districts,and it is broadly true to say that the whole county is of an urban character.By aggregating populations now grouped in contiguous non-county boroughs and urban districts it would be possible to create a series of towns,each large enough on any standard for county borough status. In this respect the county is unique. If a process of creating county boroughs were initiatedthere would be no stopping short of removing the whole area from theadministrative county and destroying the county government. In the circum-stances, the Government propose that the Commissioners should not havepower to entertain applications for county borough status from authorities inthis county.2. LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN LONDON.The structure of local government in London differs widely from that inthe rest of England and Wales. The Local Government Act, 1888, renamedthe Metropolis, that is the area then under the jurisdiction of the MetropolitanBoard of Works, as the administrative County of London and established the London County Council. The London Government Act, 1899, dividedthe county (excluding the City of London which remained under the CommonCouncil) into 28 metropolitan boroughs and established a metropolitan borough council for each borough. These councils took over the functions of thevestries and district boards together with certain additional powers, some ofwhich were transferred from the London County Council. The Local Govern-ment Act, 1929, enabled the Minister of Health to transfer functions from thecounty council to the metropolitan borough councils or to provide for theexercise of powers by the latter as agents for the county council. Two orders have been made under this power. There is no power under the existing law to alter the boundaries of the county or of the metropolitan boroughs.Two broad issues arise in connection with the County of London:_(1) whether the boundaries of the county should be extended;(2) whether, within the county, the areas of the boroughs and the alloca-tion of functions between the borough councils and the county council are satisfactory.As regards the first issue, the experience of the war has shown that for pur-poses of civil defence an at much larger than the county is a convenient unit.The London Civil Defence Region contained in 1939 a population of some
The foregoing proposals represent no more than an outline, and manydetails remain to be worked out. If effect is given to them, time alone will show whether machinery of the kind described, which in the Government&apos;view is necessary to meet the immediate needs of the post-war situation,should be retained as a permanent element&quot; in our constitutional system. Tothat extent the proposals should be regarded as in the nature of an experiment.It is recognised that experience of the working of the new services maydisclose the need of more radical alteration of the local government structure.* See the Schedules to the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, enumerating theareas which by the Local Government Act, 1888, were formed into the administrativecounty of London.(38378)   Wt. ioij 6844   **. *J lao, ij, ia, 113   ia/44   D.L.   G. 373C coo ooo as against 4,000,000 in the county. Other areas have from timeto time been carved out tor special purposes, notably the Metropolitan police district, the Metropolitan Water Board area and the London Traffic area.The present system has often been criticised on the ground that the metropolishas far outgrown the limits fixed in 1855.* On the score of administrativetidiness, there is much to be said for defining one area for the several purposesmentioned and for making that area a single administrative unit for Londono-overnment. On the other hand, it is to be noted that the existing administra-tive county already contains a population nearly double that of any other localgovernment area. In any event it is clear that an issue of this magnitude which might well involve the creation of a local government area comprisingsomething like one-fifth of the whole population of England and Wales, the dis-appearance of the County of Middlesex as an administrative unit, and heavyinroads into three or four other counties is not a matter which could beentrusted to a body of Commissioners, however authoritative. It would haveto be the subject of special legislation. Moreover, the Government are not satisfied that the present time is opportune. Several county councils andother local authorities in and around London are at present engaged in recast-ing their educational services and will shortly be confronted with other similar tasks. It would, in the view of the Government, -be a mistake to interrupt those tasks by throwing into the melting pot the whole problem ofLondon and the Home Counties.The second issue stands on a different footing. The war itself has broughtinto prominence the functions of the metropolitan borough councils in thematter of civil defence, and the importance of the local &quot; Town Hall &quot; as a centre of local effort and enthusiasm. The success with which metro-politan borough councils, no less than the London County Council, have carried out their civil defence and other wartime functions, often in circum-stances of great difficulty and danger, is deserving of every recognition; butthe very urgency and importance of the work has -emphasised the anomaly of dividing London into no less than 29 separate areas differing enormously in size and population. Moreover, the problems not only of civil defence but of reconstruction have made it clear that a reconsideration of the allocation of functions between the boroughs and the county is overdue. This is nota matter which could conveniently be handled by the proposed boundary commission which would be, as already stated, an executive body. TheGovernment accordingly propose to exclude from the sphere of this Commis-sion the whole of the County of London but to take steps to appoint an authoritative body to inquire into and advise them on the local governmentproblems within the county. In view of the effect of war damage on thecounty, the Government regard the institution of this inquiry as a matter of urgency.
