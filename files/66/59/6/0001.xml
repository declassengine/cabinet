(44) 7064^A December, 1944.WAR CABINETACCOMMODATION FOR RETURNED DOMINION PRISONERSOF war memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. It is estimated that the following Dominion prisoners of war are at present heldin Germany:  Australian............        6,100New Zealand       .........        8,050South African       ...       ......      13,400 (including 1,400 coloured troops).It is hoped that these men will be released from Germany and transported to this country on or before the conclusion of hostilities with Germany. The intention is that they willbe kept here until shipping is available to take them back home.2. The original War Office plans for the accommodation of these returned prisonersof war were based specifically on the use of Eastern, Scottish and Northern Commands,and would have avoided the use of towns in South-East England which have sufferedmost severely in the war and are most in need of rehabilitation.3. When this plan was communicated to the Dominions&apos; representatives in thiscountry, they protested vigorously and pressed that accommodation should be providednear London, and that it should be close to the amenities provided by large towns andseaside resorts. In order to meet this demand, the War Office formulated an alternative plan, which is briefly as follows:  Australians to be placed in hotels and houses, already requisitioned, inEastbourne.New Zealanders to be placed in hotels and houses, already requisitioned, inFolkestone, Westgate and Margate, and in barracks and camps in Dover andHythe.South Africans (other than coloured troops) to be placed in hotels and houses,already requisitioned, in Brighton, Hove and Worthing.South African coloured troops to be placed in hutted camps near Horsham.The administrative staffs and the first arrivals of repatriated Dominion prisonersof war are already in occupation of some of this accommodation, and the administrative arrangements of the Dominions staff are far advanced.4. No other accommodation will be available near London.5. This plan has given rise to considerable opposition from certain of the South-East coast towns concerned, particularly Brighton and Eastbourne, and this oppositionis likely to be voiced in Parliament by their Members. It is contended that these townswill suffer a serious set-back if a large number of such hotels and houses as havesurvived the war are not very soon de-requisitioned, so that they may be put in orderto receive the influx of visitors to be expected on the cessation of hostilities in Europe.(On the other hand an application was received from Margate inviting the War Officeto place repatriated Dominion prisoners of war in that town.)6. It would clearly be undesirable for statements to be made in Parliament or else-where^ which would lead to the impression being gained by the Dominions that theirreturned prisoners of war were not welcome in this country, or in any particular partof it. Furthermore, the War Office is anxious that there shall be no failure on our part to show in a practical way appreciation for hospitality extended by the Dominions to all
the British Services. In South Africa particularly many thousands have been lavishlyentertained for over four years; in Australia plans are already foreshadowed along thesame lines. A few weeks on the South Coast for a handful of returned prisoners of warseems a modest return for all this. The Australians and South Africans may be expectedto resent being ejected from accommodation where they are well settled in and movedaway against their will. This resentment will certainly be strongly felt in the Dominionsthemselves, where interest in prisoner of war welfare is very strong. If, however, theWar Cabinet were to authorize the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to approach the Dominion Prime Ministers concerned with the request that they should forgo their demand that the returned prisoners of war should be accommodated near London, forthe reasons indicated in paragraph 5 above, an alternative solution to this problem shouldbe possible, by finding accommodation within the Commands originally proposed,though the actual accommodation originally suggested to the Dominions could not nowbe made available as much of it has already been allocated for other important require-ments. A War Cabinet decision on the matter is necessary in order that the proposalmay be put to the Dominion Governments with a sufficient degree of urgency.7. Canada is not concerned in this matter, since Canadian prisoners of war are tobe accommodated in permanent barracks at Aldershot now allotted to the Canadianmilitary authorities.P. J.
