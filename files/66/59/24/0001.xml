(44) 724.12th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER  ALLOCATIONS   FOR   THE   NAVY   1st  JANUARY-30th  JUNE,   1945.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.1. The commitments falling upon the Royal Navy and the Royal Marineswhich have to be taken into account in determining the recruiting programme during this period require an allocation of 88,950 men and women. This figure is based on the decision to maintain the Naval effort in Europe necessary tomeet the changing conditions until Germany is defeated, and to effect the gradualtransfer of the Fleet to the Eastern theatre in accordance with the policy settled at &quot;Octagon.&quot;. 2. It will be appreciated that the necessity for implementing the transfersto the East before Germany is defeated will inevitably throw an increased burden on the Navy whose man-power resources were allocated early in 1944 on theassumption that no additional commitments in the East would arise untilGermany was defeated. This allocation was subsequently reduced in July and august 1944, by transfers to&apos;the Army and cuts in intake.3. Towards meeting the present commitments of 88,950, the Admiralty, arerelying on the transfer of 17,200 maintenance ratings from the R.A.F. as providedfor in the 1944 man-power allocation. Discussions are proceeding with the AirMinistry on the details of this transfer which it is hoped to start in January 1945.This leaves a net requirement of 71,750.4. The Admiralty propose to ask for an allocation of only 30,000 newentries (27,000 men and 3,000 women) and will do their utmost to find the balanceof 41,750, by arbitrary cuts and adjustments to be arranged within the naval service, on the understanding that this will not prejudice the escort forces todeal with the U-boat threat, nor the minesweeping forces.5. This figure of 30,000 represents the additional numbers required asspecialist officers and in the tradesmen and specialist branches, over and aboveany that may be produced by the above measures, and is essential to meet the agreed commitments of the Navy. It is emphasised that there is no scope what-ever for any cut in this number. The ranks and ratings concerned are requiredfor branches where there are already shortages and which admit of noretrenchment.6. Many women are required for service abroad. They cannot be sent abroad under 21 years of age without their parents&apos; consent even if it weredesirable to do so. At present the Admiralty are restricted to recruiting girlsunder 19 years old and a high proportion of the W.R.N.S. are under 20. TheAdmiralty ask, therefore, to be allowed in future to recruit up to 50 per cent,of their allocation from women volunteers over 21 years of age.[28816]
7. A saving of 41,750 is considerably in excess of anything that can vet before seen. The Admiralty only make this proposal because they recognise the gravity of the man-power situation. It must be emphasised, however, that ifexperience shows that the intended saving cannot be achieved, the Admiraltywill have again to represent the situation to the War Cabinet., Three separate points which have to be borne in mind are : (i) That no provision is included in these calculations to complete the 20,000R.M. Engineers required for the Eastern Theatre. The latestindications are that this requirement may be met in part by usingItalian labour. This will, however, not be forthcoming for somemonths : in the interval, and to meet the balance ultimatelyoutstanding, special civil enginering grades will have -to be foundeither by the loan of R.E.S or by a special man-power allocation. a particularly important and, in part, urgent requirement is for some700 tradesmen (such as electricians and mechanics) to balance theR.M.E. formations which the Admiralty are arranging to send to the theatre.(ii) The great difference in the deployment of a large Fleet in Eastern.Waters, as compared with the European Theatre, is that a largenumber of uniformed skilled personnel must be provided for worknormally carried out by civilians in the United Kingdom. Thisinevitably increases the total man-power figures of the Navyconsiderably.(iii) Men becoming available for other employment through arbitrary cutsand adjustments will, in many cases, be unfit for foreign service.8. Throughout these calculations the Admiralty have made no provisiontowards implementing the Government scheme for the reallocation of man-powerand releases after the defeat of Germany. If the Admiralty were to ask for mento implement the various phases of the reallocation scheme on the same basis as proposed by the Secretary of State in W.P. (44) 705, a large additional entrywould be necessary.The Admiralty requirement in respect of nursing staff amounts to- -Nurses    ...............       ...       150V.A.D.S...................      500Industrial Man-poxoer.The Admiralty allocation for the period ending the 31st December, 1944, is850,000 : actually our numbers have run down rather more slowly than we expected and the numbers borne on that date will be about 860,000.The preparation and equipment of ships of all types for the war in theFar East and the continuing demands. of the war agaiirst Germany are nowcreating an increasingly heavy load in the shipyards. In addition, the repair of warships, merchant ships and transports has assumed such serious proportionsas to cause considerable anxiety. Nor is there any prospect of immediate relief :on the contrary, the certainty of heavy weather early in 1945 and the possibilityof renewed U-boat activity render the situation more disturbing. To meet this situation a net addition of 6,000 (including .4,000 for repair work) is urgently needed in the present shipyard labour force.I therefore ask for sanction to retain the December 1944 allocation of850,000 up to the 30th June, 1945, on the understanding that we shall endeavourto recruit within that labour force the additional skilled man-power which the shipyards and the industries supporting the shipyards will need to meet theheavy commitments I have mentioned.To sum up, I ask for 1(i) 27,000 new entries for the Navy.(ii) 3,000 new entries for the W.R.N.S., up to 50 per cent, of futureallocations to be recruited from women volunteers over 21 yearsof age.(iii) 150 Nurses :&apos; 500 V.A.D.S.(iv) The retention of the industrial man-power allocation of 850,000 duringthe period under review.A.
