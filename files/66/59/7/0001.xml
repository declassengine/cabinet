THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT ,-, --.---------&apos;---------,------ .---v-Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 707.5th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.MACEDONIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith, a memorandum by Sir Orme Sargenton the Macedonian problem and the idea of a union between Yugoslavia and bulgaria.2. If my colleagues agree, I would propose that we should inform theSoviet Government of our views on the subject, in the sense of the last paragraphof this memorandum.A. E.Foreign Office, 5th December, 1944.NO sooner was the ink dry on the Bulgarian Armistice than signs began to appear which showed that Tito&apos;s Yugoslavs were beginning to think aboutYugoslav-Bulgarian federation, and that the Bulgarians were going once again to foster the so-called Macedonian claims. So far nothing very tangible or officialhas emerged, but clearly a great deal of-talking and planning is going on in thewings. Tito himself has given the lead in various interviews and speeches inwhich he has gone out of the way to sing the praises of Yugoslav-Bulgarianfriendship, and some of Tito&apos;s henchmen have gone yet further and publiclydemanded Greek Macedonia for Yugoslavia. Meanwhile the Bulgarian press,has announced a meeting in Belgrade between Yugoslav and Bulgarian delegateswhen the future internal political organisation of Yugoslavia was discussed, onthe assumption that there will be a federation into which Macedonia will alsoenter. One of the Bulgarian delegates was a member of the Government. in bulgaria, too, the Macedonian propagandists have been getting busy in the press and have been allowed to hold a meeting in Sofia to discuss the creation of anindependent Macedonia within a Slav federation comprising Bulgaria and thedifferent sections of the Yugoslav people. Again, there have been stories of aMacedonian brigade operating in Greek Macedonia.2. These activities may at present not amount to more than foolishvapourings and petty intrigues , but they are clearly being condoned and probablyabetted by the two Governments. They also benefit greatly by the fact that Greeceis at present too weak to assert her interests in the Balkans. If not checked theyare likely to grow into a serious agitation which, in the present anarchical stateof the Balkans, might easily get out of hand and lead to direct action, to coupsd&apos;Etat and to fighting.3. We should be well advised, therefore, to examine once again the natureof this old and intractable problem of Macedonia and also its relation to themore recent idea of a Slav Federation embodying Yugoslavia, Bulgaria andMacedonia. For we shall in the near future have to decide what attitude HisMajesty&apos;s Government ought to adopt towards it in the light of present Britishinterests. We can hardly remain passive and indifferent in view of our policyof building up Greece and supporting Turkey as a Balkan Power.414.   The so-called Macedonian problem dates back to the Treaty of Berlinin 1878, but it acquired its present form as a result of the Second Balkan War12591   [28762] &quot;. ,
in 1912, when the Turkish territory, inhabited by Slavs claiming to be Mace-donians, was seized by Greece and Serbia and divided between them, leavingto defeated Bulgaria only that small part of so-called Macedonia as is comprised in the Strumitza Valley and the district of Pirin. Both Greece and Serbia have tried to absorb their Macedonian population. Greece may be said to have done so by Hellenising the territory. They settled in it the Greeks brought out fromAsia Minor and so transformed the Slav majority into a minority. The Serbshave net been so successful. They set out to treat the Macedonians as fellowSerbs, and their territory became &quot; South Serbia.&quot; But the population has refusedto be absorbed into the .Serb nation and has been encouraged by the Bulgarians,who, while recognising that &quot; Greek &quot; Macedonia was in present circumstancesbeyond their reach, have never accepted the Serb settlement. This BulgarianMacedonia ever since the Balkan wars has been the focus of a terrorist agitation,continuous though varying in intensity, bent on asserting the separate identity of Southern Serbia as Macedonia and demanding either its autonomy or itsannexation to Bulgaria. The quarrel has throughout been primarily with theSerbs and with the Serb dynasty not between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia forthough Serbia was absorbed after the last war into Yugoslavia, and though (or perhaps because) it was the dominant partner in the new State, the Croats andSlovenes have never felt themselves to be parties in this quarrel.5. During the entire period between the wars there have always been certainforward-looking Slavs both in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria-who saw in a federalunion between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria and Macedonia a solution to theMacedonian problem. But the practical objections were too great for the idea tomake real headway. First there was the rivalry between the two national dynastiesas to which should give way to the other. Then the Serbs were shrewd enoughto see that in such a union they would no longer be the dominant force as theywere in Yugoslavia, but would themselves be dominated by a combination ofCroats and Slovenes on one side and Bulgars and Macedonians on the other.Greece and Turkey also were opposed to the idea because they rightly foresawthat a Slav State stretching across the Balkans from the Adriatic to the black sea would be a direct threat to their own territories.6. For it is a fallacy to suppose that if Serbian and Bulgarian differenceswere eliminated or if there were final and genuine union between yugoslavia and Bulgaria, the Balkan problem would be settled and peace and stability reignin South-East Europe. As Sir Nevile Henderson pointed out in 1934 at thetime of the conclusion of the Balkan Pact, this is a fundamental error. &quot; Peaceends where Serb or rather Yugoslav-Bulgar union begins. . . . With the balkan states as at present constituted, the balance of power is fairly well distributed.But this is at once altered if Bulgaria unites with Yugoslavia.&quot; A federal unionbetween the different sections of Yugoslavia on the one hand and Bulgaria onthe other will mean not so much the end but the transformation of the Macedonianquestion into something far more dangerous, i.e., combined Yugoslav-Bulgarianexpansion southwards to recover Macedonian and Bulgarian irredenta. Bulgarianclaims for the restoration of Western Thrace, in desisting which Greece hashitherto had the support of Yugoslavia, would henceforward be Slav claims put-forward with all the additional strength which the union between the two countries would entail. Serbia, afterwards Yugoslavia, in the past coveted the port ofSalonika which controls Greece&apos;s richest province and is vital to Greek economy,while Bulgaria has always looked on Salonika as the eventual capital of aGreater Macedonia. With the union of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, Greece mightwell be faced with joint pressure for this vital port put forward either as ageneral Slav interest or as the satisfaction of the natural aspirations of theautonomous Macedonia, newly established as one of the federal partners&apos; in the yugoslav-Bulgarian union.7. For these reasons the idea of a Yugoslav-Bulgarian union was neverallowed to enter the realm of practical politics. But in the conditions existingto-day the obstacles which impeded it before the war are now greatly lessenedand it looks as though, if revived, the idea might easily grow into a politicalreality. For instance, the personal rivalry and mutual suspicion of the two )dynasties^ which in pre-war years so effectively precluded Yugoslav-Bulgariancollaboration, is no longer a factor of any importance. The Yugoslav King isan exile and the Bulgarian King an infant, and the prospects of either rulingwhere their fathers ruled is small. Secondly, Tito and the Partisan Movementare pursuing a very carefully planned and deliberate policy of reducing Serbian.
influence in. Yugoslavia. Tito has squeezed the Serbs into the confines of OldSerbia .and by the decrees of last November has divided Yugoslavia into autono-mous units. One of these has been carved out of Serbia to make &quot; Macedonia.&quot;In this connexion it is significant that reports are now current of a secret agree-ment whereby Pirin, the Bulgarian province of Macedonia, is to be united withBulgarian consent to Yugoslav Macedonia. It cannot be supposed that Bulgariawould yield up this territory except in the sure hope that it was a prelude toher entering herself into a Yugoslav-Bulgarian federation, of which Macedoniawould be one of the constituent States. And thirdly, Greece at this criticalmoment is in a state of chaos and in no position to assert her views or defendher interests.   Turkey, too, as a neutral, is in no strong position to intervene.8. Culturally and racially such a federation would have natural affinitieswith the Soviet Union and the political relations between the two would undoubtedly be very close. Moreover, the Soviet Union might well sponsor Slavexpansionist aspirations. It might serve the Soviet Union&apos;s strategic interestsvery nicely if this South Slav union had a port on the iEgean, such as Salonica.We know that the Soviet Union wish to revise the Straits Convention in order to deprive Turkey of her discretionary power to close and shut the Straits. Theloss of Adrianople by Turkey would make Turkish Thrace and the Europeanshore of the Straits indefensible. Turkey would be eliminated as a European andBalkan Power and whatever the regime of the Straits a Power friendly to theSoviet Union would acquire what would be tantamount to physical control. (Itmight be mentioned here that in 1940 the Soviet Government offered the bulgarian government the Enos-Midia line in return for Bulgaria&apos;s signature to a Pact of mutual Assistance.)9. If such is the picture of the present situation and a correct estimate of possible developments, how are British interests affected and how best can they be safeguarded ?10. In the past we have hoped that a solution to these and other Balkanproblems might be found in the union of all the Balkan States Allied and enemy states alike and including perhaps Turkey, into one Federal State. As a first step in this direction we encouraged the agreement in 1941 between the greek and Yugoslav Governments in exile, which was to be the basis of such a BalkanFederation. The idea was allowed to drop because the Soviet Government viewed the graeco-Yugoslav agreement with suspicion. They thought that the intention was to develop it into a rampart against Russian influence and penetration inthe Balkans. In these circumstances and with Russian armies in occupation of roumania, Bulgaria, and a large part of Yugoslavia, it would be useless now to revive either the graeco-Yugoslav agreement or the idea of an all-inclusive BalkanFederation. But that is no reason why we should not make it plain that we refuseto consider an exclusive Yugoslav-Bulgarian union as in any way an alternative.Indeed, since we shall in our own interests sooner or later have to veto any suchcombination, it will be best to make our views known before the policies of theSoviet Government and the Yugoslav and Bulgarian Governments havecrystallised.   Only so can we hope to avoid future recrimination and conflicts.11. The actual manner of doing so will have to be carefully thought out, butit is clearly desirable that whatever action we do take should be taken as quickly as possible. In general the position we would take up would be that (a) although we would welcome a federation between all the Balkan States, both Allied and enemy and including if possible Turkey, we cannot agree to an exclusive union or federation between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria because it would disturb thebalance of power between the Balkan States, because it would isolate Greece andendanger her position as a Balkan State, and because it would enable Bulgaria,who has in both world wars joined Germany against her Balkan neighbours and against the Western democratic Powers, to escape by this process from the conse-quences of her acts by merging her identity in that of one of the United Nations;and (b) although we are prepared to acquiesce in the creation of a MacedonianState in the future Federal Yugoslavia, we must insist that this State shall notannex nor lay claim to any territories whatsoever belonging to either Bulgaria orGreece, on the ground that these territories are &quot; Macedonian.&quot;30th&apos; November, 1944.0.
