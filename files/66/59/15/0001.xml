On the night of the 29th/30th, E-boats attempting to mine the approaches to the Scheldt were driven off by H.M.S. Stevenstone (destroyer) and coastal forces.Another group of E-boats unsuccessfully attacked the Antwerp convoy. H.M.S.Duff (frigate) and L.S.T. 321 were damaged by mines in the Channel N.W. ofOstend but reached port.H.M.S. Stevenstone was damaged by a mine off Walcheren on the evening of the 30th but reached port.On the 2nd H.M.S. Columbine (corvette) was damaged in heavy weatherwhile on escort duty off the W. coast of Ireland (R) and had to return to port.On the 6th H.M.S Bullen (frigate) was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat off Cape Wrath; there were over 100 survivors.3. During the week ending the 5th the combined British and U.S. dischargesthrough the liberated ports were approximately 29,500 men, 8,250 vehicles,355,000 tons of supplies and 97,500 tons of petrol.Mediterranean.A driatic.4. On the 3rd H.M. destroyers Brocklesby, Lamerton, Quantock and Wiltonwith gun landing craft and 2 M.T.Bs. shelled Lussinpiccolo. At the same timeM.T.B. 633(entered Cigale Cove in the same vicinity and destroyed 3 explosivemotor boats and damaged a fourth.JEgean.5. On the night of the 4th/5th, H.M.S. Aurora (cruiser) with H.M.destroyers Marne, Meteor and Musketeer bombarded enemy shipping in Rhodesharbour.On the 4th three ratings were wounded in an attack by E.L.A.S. on combinedNaval headquarters at Athens. The situation deteriorated on the following day and Allied warships moved out to Salamis Strait in readiness to bombard ifcalled upon by the Army.The port of Kavalla in N.E. Greece is reported to be almost undamaged;the approaches to the harbour have been cleared of mines.A British reconnaissance party is believed to be in control -of the port ofE&quot;eraclion (Crete), which is only slightly damaged.Bast Indies.6. H.M. S/M Thorough during a recent patrol in the Strait of Malaccaprobably destroyed 2 coasters and sank 3 junks.Anti-Submarine Operations.7.

A large number of explosive motor-boats, midget submarines, one-mantorpedoes and assault boats are disposed in North and South Norway, NorthDenmark and in the Low Countries.U-boats.9. Activity continues in Canadian waters and off the adjacent seaboardof the United States. U-boats have been reported in North Russian waters.Two U-boats are believed to have reached Saint Naziaire, possibly with stores forthe garrison.It is reported that experimental alterations are being carried out to reducethe diving time of U-boats and the swirl miade when diving.
Enemy Attaok on Shipping.10. A British, ship was torpedoed and sunk in the Gulf of Maine, and a united States ship in convoy was mined off Ostend and is a total loss. AnotherUnited States ship was damaged by a mine in the Scheldt but reached port.11. Provisional shipping losses by enemy action during November were5 ships of 22,147 tons. Marine casualties raised the total of losses from allcauses to 13 ships of 34,831 tons.Allied Minelaying.   .12. Mines have been laid by surface craft in Home Waters, and by one ofHM. submarines in the Malacca Strait.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.13. No reports of enemy minelaying by aircraft have been received thisweek. E-boats laid mines in the channel N.W. of Ostend on the night of the29th/30th.The mine clearance at Antwerp was completed on the 4th.&apos; In this area 273mines have been destroyed. The channel between Dieppe and Boulogne was established on the 2nd.14. Clearance operations have been carried out off the heel of Italy where19 mines have been destroyed. During the week 34 mines have been destroyed in the Sibenik approach channel.On the 29th, a minesweeper trawler was mined and sunk off Piraeus, and onthe 1st a British ferry was sunk, possibly by a mine, in the Gulf of Petras. Twomines were destroyed in Mudros Harbour on the 4th.&apos; Since the beginning of September 2,000 mines have been destroyed in theMediterranean.   The mine totals are 6,190 ground and 7,518 moored.I1UUUJI     lUOlUUdlllb    kJlJUJ^JJlllg. .15. Between the 1st and 15th November 8 enemy ships of 16,422 tons were sunk or captured or became constructive total losses. Of these 4 ships of9,979 tons were in the Mediterranean.It is reported that 5 Danish passenger ships have been seized by the Germans.Four Norwegian ships totalling some 18,000 tons and 2 German tankers are reported to have been damaged ,by sabotage in Oslo on the 23rd.It is estimated that since October the equivalent of 3 divisions has been shipped from the Oslo area to Denmark.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.16. The French have made further progress through the Vosges and down the west bank of the Rhine from Strasbourg.In the Saar region, important advances have been made resulting in the liberation of Saarunion, while fighting is in progress in Sarreguemines,Saarlautern and the approaches to Saarbrucken.A week of fierce fighting has resulted in only limited gains in the area east of Aix-la-Chapelle.All resistance has ceased west of the Maas in the British sector.Southern Group of Armies.17. The First French Army continues to exert pressure against the southernflank of the enemy pocket between the Rhine and the Vosges. In the forest east of Mulhouse, there has been hard fighting, and some local gains have been madeby the enemy. There has been little progress north of Mulhouse, where the enemy has been able to deploy a considerable number of anti-tank weapons, guns andmines. Further west, French troops have advanced 7 miles down the St. Maurice-Mulhouse road.[28774] -  , b
On the 4th the First French Army assumed command of all the operations to close the enemy Rhine-Vosges pocket.South of Strasbourg, French and U.S. troops of the Seventh U.S. Armyliberated Benfeld on the 1st and Selestat, 30 miles south of Strasbourg, onthe 5th. On the 4th, a U.S. force which had been fighting through the Vosges,liberated Ribeauville on the western edge of the Colmar plain.In all, the enemy Rhine-Vosges pocket has been reduced by about one-quarterduring the last week.North of. Strasbourg, the Seventh U.S. Army has advanced along its whole front. On the right, it is within 2 miles of Haguenau, and in the centre, Ingwillerhad been liberated by the 2nd. Since then, a strong thrust directed north between these two towns has reached a point within 7 miles of the German frontier. Onthe left, east of Saarunion, the advance has kept pace with that of the ThirdU.S. Army.Central Group of Armies.18. On its right flank, the Third U.S. Army has had a hard fight forSaarunion, which was liberated by the 2nd. In the centre, south of Saarbrucken,a strong U.S. force has broken the crust of enemy resistance, and latest reports indicate that this force is fighting in the streets of Sarreguemines. Further north,another IJ.S. force, released from the area of Metz, has crossed the german frontier on a wide front and is approaching the Siegfried Line defences west of Saarbrucken. Striking progress has been made at Saarlautern; here theU.S. force which earlier had established the Thionville bridgehead, secured intacta bridge across the Saar on the 2nd, and has since made further assault crossings.The enemy is contesting the bridgehead strongly, but latest reports indicate thatour hold on the east bank has been strengthened, and heavy fighting is in progressboth in and around Saarlautern.The Third U.S. Army also controls the west bank of the Saar for a further15 miles to the north, and is reported to have patrols across the river in thevicinity of Merzig.West of the Roer, the First U.S. Army has made further slight gains in theHurtgen forest and has secured a crossing &quot;of the Inde, a small tributary of theRoer, which runs due south from Julich. Further north, the Ninth U.S. army was reported on the 2nd to be fighting in the streets of Julich, but no more detailshave yet been received. Also on the 2nd, Linnich was captured, and the NinthU.S. Army now holds the west bank of the Roer on a front of several miles.North of Geilenkirchen there lias again been fierce fighting, but little progress.Northern Group of Armies.19. On the 3rd, the enemy bridgehead remaining west of the Meuse atBlerick was liquidated, and by the 5th all organised enemy resistance west ofthe river had ceased.&apos;On the 2nd and 3rd, the enemy made two breaches in the southern bank ofthe Neder Rijn west of Arnhem, and the consequent flooding has compelled anumber of our troops to make local withdrawals. During the same period, theenemy attempted to infiltrate into our positions east of Nijmegen, but finally lostmost of his force in casualties and prisoners.There have been several patrol clashes along the line of the Maas in the FirstCanadian Army Sector.Italy. (An outline map is included as an inset.)20. During the early part of this period activity in the Eighth Army waschiefly confined to fairly heavy fighting south of Russr, and in the Fifth army to following up enemy withdrawals S.W. of Brisighella.On the 3rd, Canadian troops, who had come into the line on the right flank of the Eighth Army, broke through enemy defences and outflanked Russi to theeast and to the west. On the following day they exploited this success and pushedfurther northwards, and patrols entered Ravenna. To the S.W. of Faenza Britishand Polish troops also started to move, and bridgeheads over the Lamone riverwere established. On the 5th, the Canadians continued to push north-westwardsfrom Ravenna up Highway 16, and were last reported to be held up at Mezzano,where both the road and railway bridges had been blown up by the enemy. Tothe S.W. of Faenza the bridgeheads over the Lamone river were enlarged; progress was slow due to strong opposition and difficult terrain conditions. On the 6th bad weather impeded operations.
Activity in the Fifth Army has continued to be confined to patrol work,except for the progress reported in the opening paragraph, and the capture ofan important hill feature west of Casal Fiuminese, by British forces on the 5th.The Eastern European Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Soicthern Sector.21. In Czechoslovakia the Russians gained some ground in the directionof Kosice.In Northern Hungary they captured Satoraljaujhely and Kiskolc.The Russian attacks from the bridgeheads across the Danube west ofSombor succeeded on the 29th November in breaking through the Germandefences, and since then the Russians have been vigorously exploiting theirsuccess. Driving north-westwards from the area of their original break-through, they have captured Kaposvar and reached Lake Balaton. At the sametime the,y have pushed northwards along the west bank of the Danube.In Northern Yugoslavia the Russians captured Mitrovioa on the 4th.Further south the German withdrawal from Southern Yugoslavia andAlbania continued. Scutari has been evacuated and Albania has been practicallycleared of German troops.Yugoslavia.22. The Germans have lost further ground hi Serbia, where the Partisanshave occupied Cacak and Kraljevo (approximately 100 miles east of Serajevo)and the Bulgarians have taken Novi Pazar (110 miles S.E. of Serajevo).Two German divisions are trapped in South Montenegro. Their attempts to break out northwards have been unsuccessful, and a relieving column fromthe north was driven back without bein^ able to establish contact.In Dalmatia the Partisans have captured the town of Knin, an importantcentre of communications.Greece.23. Civil disorder broke out in Athens on the 3rd and has now developedinto serious street fighting between British and Greek regular troops on the onehand and E.L.A.S. guerillas on the other. A demonstration staged byE.A.M./E.L.A.S. in defiance of Government orders gave rise to exchange of fire and grenades with the Government police. On the following day some 800E.L.A.S. troops wrere disarmed by British troops without resistance.Subsequently the situation deteriorated, when E.L.A.S. troops occupied anumber of police stations and their columns were reported to be marching on thecapital.General Scobie has now ordered full military measures to be taken againstE.L.A.S. forces, including air attack on their columns, in view of the fact thatthey have defied all orders both from himself as commander of all troops in greece and from the Greek Government.On the 4th, E.A.M./E.L.A.S. formally seized power in Salonika andMacedonia. The British Military Commander in Salonika called E.A.M.delegates to a conference on the 5th in an effort to restore order wuthout the intervention of British troops.Burma.24. West African troops during the past week have advanced down thePi Chaung Valley. They have now turned eastwards into the Kaladan Valleyand are in the area 7 miles south of Kaladan village.East African troops entered Kalewa from the west on the 3rd to find thatthe Japanese had withdrawn before them. A bridgehead has now beenestablished across the Chindwin River to the east of Kalewa. The bridgeheadin the Sittaung area has been further enlarged and is now some 25 miles in depth.In North Burma there has been no substantial change in the Bhamo area where the Japanese defenders still hold out. Allied troops have advanced about two-thirds of the distance along the Bhamo-Namhkam road and are now, about15 miles from Namhkam.[28774]b 2
China.25. The Japanese have continued their advance along the Liuchow-Kweiyang road reaching Nantan on the 28th November and Liuchai on the 30th.The second column, advancing on Tuyun (70 miles south of Kweiyang) has reached the vicinity of San Ho (30-miles S.E. of Tuyun).To the south, a new Japanese thrust has developed from French Indo-China.Japanese forces have entered China from the Lang Son region and capturedPingsiang on the main road to Liuchow. Fighting has also been reported inthe vicinity of Kwote some 28 miles S.E. of Poseh.Philippines.28. Fierce fighting continues in the area immediately south of Limon whereJapanese counter-attacks with tanks have been flung back. U.S. forces havemade some gains in the areas west and S.W. of Burauen, and they have been further reinforced in Leyte, where enemy casualties now amount to 23,669 killed.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.27. Fighter Command flew 157 defensive sorties against flying-bombs; oneMosquito is missing. Attacks on long-range rocket sites in Holland are referredto in paragraph 29 and details of enemy activity against this country are reportedunder &quot;Enemy Activity and Flome Security.&quot;Home Waters.28. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 354 sorties on anti-submarine &quot;operations; 4 aircraft are missing.Several attacks were made on shipping off Norway, particularly during thelatter part of the week when the weather had improved. Mosquitoes, afterattacking a group of 8 vessels off the Norwegian coast, left four 2,500/4,000-tonvessels and 2 smaller ones on fire. On the same day Beaufighters set fire to thelargest vessel among 4 attacked off Orsten Fiord.A Halifax successfully bombed two 2,000-ton ships off The Skaw, straddlingthe leading vessel which was left damaged.Western Europe.29. In the week ended dawn on the 6th, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) flew11,802 sorties and dropped 3,978 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawn onthe 7th, Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew 7,584 sorties and dropped 20,635 tons, while Fighter Command and U.S. VIII Fighter Com-mand flew 5,204 sorties. One hundred and sixty enemy aircraft were destroyed and 46 damaged; 202 Allied aircraft are missing, but some may have landed in allied territory.At the beginning of the week operations continued to be restricted by bad weather but heavy attacks were made later against railway, oil and industrial targets, Pathfinder technique being employed in many cases.On one day 269 escorted heavy bombers, while attacking 3 railway centres(all through cloud) at Oberlahnstein (7 miles S. of Coblenz 416 tons), Bingen(321 tons), Coblenz (23 tons), destroyed 33 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed3 others among over 150 which were encountered. Eleven bombers and 7 fighters were missing from this operation, but 5 of the latter are believed to have landed in Allied territory.- On another daylight operation 1,100 heavies bombed 7 railway centres atSoest (15 miles S.E. of Hamm), Cassel, Bebra, Giessen, Mainz, Friedberg andCoblenz, dropping a total of 2,816 tons on Pathfinder technique. Again enemy aircraft intercepted and 6 were destroyed by escorting fighters.Soest railway centre was again bombed in better wea,ther (by night) later inthe week, 474 aircraft dropping 1,852 tons. Bombing was well concentrated and30 minutes after the attack fierce fires were seen which were evenly distributedover the target area.Other railway centres attacked were Neunkirchen (706 tons), Homburg(371 tons), both targets lying N.E. of Saarbrucken; Heilbronn (150 tons), Hamm(452 tons), Munster (257 tons), and Bielefeld (337 tons).
Thick cloud prevented the assessment of results when&apos;786 heavy bombersoperated in daylight over the synthetic oil plants at Bohlen, Zeitz (both nearLeipzig), Lutzkendorf (near Halle) and Merseburg, 1,728 tons being released.Merseburg was again successfully bombed later in the week, this time by night(962 tons). Duisburg was twice visited, once by 537 heavies accompanied by 15Mosquitoes which together dropped 2,270 tons on the town through cloud, and again by 37 Mosquitoes which dropped 51 tons on a benzol plant. After thelatter operation reconnaissance aircraft reported a large column of smoke rising10,000 feet, while in the case of the former bombing is believed to have been successful, as several large fires and explosions were seen. Bombing is also considered to have been well concentrated in an attack on the Hansa benzol plant at Dortmund.Two coking plants at Bottrop and Osterfeld (near Oberhausen) each received312 tons of bombs in the course of daylight attacks, and in the latter case smokewas visible above thick cloud.On the 5th, 857 tons were released on an engineering and tank assemblyworks at Berlin (Tegel), mostly through cloud. A few bombers were able toattack visually, but the majority used navigational aids and were unable to assess the damage. Enemy aircraft which intercepted en route and over the targetwere most successfully attacked, by fighters which broke up their formations.Ninety-one were destroyed, 7 probably destroyed and 23 damaged. Twelve heavy bombers are missing from this operation (of which 8 are attributed to A.A. fire)while 24 escorting fighters failed to return, although some are believed to havelanded in Allied territory.Among a number of German towns which received attention during theweek, the principal targets were Hagen (11 miles S. of Dortmund), where alarge explosion was observed after 1,818 tons had been dropped by 465 heavy bombers at night, this despite thick cloud; Oberhausen (856 tons), where a goodconcentration was obtained in daylight; and Karlsruhe and Heilbronn.At Karlsruhe, which was twice attacked (2,372 tons), some good fires and large explosions were seen, although the weather prevented a reliable assessment of results. Bombing was fairly well concentrated at Heilbronn (1,090 tons)and many fires and several explosions observed.Other towns bombed were Hamburg, Giessen (twice), Fulda and the Hansasteel works at Hallendorf.Over 100 sorties were made by Spitfires against long-range rocket sites in holland. In some of the earlier cases the aircraft despatched were eitherprevented by weather from completing their missions or from observing results.Some sites, however, did sustain damage where, in addition to bombs, manyrounds from machine-guns and&apos;cannon were effectively fired. On the 5th, 8- Spit-fires, among 28 despatched, reported excellent results on the sites attacked.In the battle area the bad weather which occurred prevented operations bybombers of S.H.A.E.E. (Air) on some days of the week. Nevertheless, a consider-able tonnage was released on defended enemy positions and other targets.On one day 288 medium bombers dropped a total of 474 tons on defended ,positions in the Duren, Saarbrucken and neighbouring areas, where they also attacked railways; cloud prevented assessment of results, however. On thefollowing day, 134 aircraft of the same type dropped 231 tons at Fraulautern,Saarlautern and Ensdorf, again through cloud. These three areas were bombeda second time later in the week with results varying from poor to excellent(343 tons)^Heavy support was given by fighters and fighter-bombers to land forcesthroughout the week, particularly in the Julich and Duren areas, and manysuccessful attacks were made on railways, rolling-stock, bridges and other targets.Railway lines were cut at over 200 places, and 270 locomotives, more than 2,200railway wagons, 400 M.T. and over 40 barges were destroyed or damaged.A total of 3,056 sorties was flown by aircraft carrying supplies to theContinent.Apparently as a result of transferring a number of G.A.F. fighters to the interception of Allied night bombers, there has been a notable weakness of air support in the Aix-la-Chapelle sector, with the exception of the 3rd December,when about 250/300 fighter&apos; sorties were flown on close-support in this area.On the other hand, the Alsace-Lorraine front, and particularly the approaches to the Saar, have consistently received support on a moderate scale during theweek.Note/ Appendices VII and VIII give Raid Assessments and OperationalStatistics respectively. ...
Southern Europe.30. During the week ended dawn on the 5th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew7.579 sorties (including 1,093 by heavy bombers) and dropped 3,240 tons of bombs.Three enemy aircraft were destroyed and 44 Allied aircraft (including 13 heavy bombers) are missing.Adverse weather generally restricted operations.Italy.31.   No attacks were made by bombers of the Strategic Air Force.On the 2nd, the&apos;Tactical Air Force, taking advantage of a temporaryimprovement in the weather, made one of their strongest efforts for some days inwidespread attacks against enemy supply lines and close support targets in the battle area. Mitchells successfully operated in strength against railway bridgeson the Brenner line, and Bostons attacked the airfields at Ghedi, Villafranca andBergamo, whilst 1,215 sorties by light and fighter-bombers and fighters, of which are missing, resulted in fires among tank concentrations, ammunition dumpsand buildings and in the destruction of or damage to 6 bridges, over 50 M.T.and 150 railway cars; railway lines were cut in 62 places.On other days medium bombers scored direct hits on railway bridges east of Milan and east of Mantua; fighter-bombers and fighters carried out routineoperations in such strength as weather permitted, in the course of which exten-sive damage was caused to enemy lines of communication, particularly in thePo Valley.R.P. Beaufighters scored many hits on gun positions and the power houseat Lussinpiccolo. in conjunction with the naval attack.The Coastal Air Force continued to operate against small shipping in theNorth Adriatic and against communication targets in the Riviera; iapproxi-mately 20 barges were left in flames during the course of the week.Yugoslavia.32. Road communications between Podgorica and Klopot, and the bridgeat Bioce were the targets both for strategic bombers and for aircraft of the balkan Air Force, whilst Mitchells bombed the railway bridge 10 miles N.W.of Zagreb and Lightnings destroyed one span of another 30 miles North ofSerajevo. R.P. Beaufighters scored many hits on barracks at Bjelovar (40 miles.N.E. of Zagreb) and at Gracac (31 miles E.N.E. of Zara). About 70 Welling-tons and IJ.S. Dakotas carried out supply-dropping operations.Austria and South Germany.33. The oil refineries at Blechhammer and Opertal were attacked by342 U.S. heavy bombers, of which 8 are missing; 532 tons were dropped but the bombing is reported to have been somewhat scattered.In Austria, the following targets were attacked by U.S. heavy bombers,the results in all cases being unobserved: Vienna/Florisdorf oil refinery(168 tons). Vienna S.E. goods depot (86 tons) and Linz benzol plant (39 tons).Small tonnages were also dropped on a number of railway centres.Russia.34. There have been no reports during the week regarding the activitiesof the Russian Air Force, which silence is believed to be due to security considera-tions and does not necessarily indicate that the scale of effort has been low.Fleet aircraft are reported to have sunk 2 supply ships of 9,000 and 5,000 tons.The increased Russian pressure in the Baltic States resulted in a fair scale of effort by the G.A.F. In Hungary, the G.A.F. strength is insufficient to giveadequate support in both combat areas, i.e., N.E. and S.W. of Budapest, andan attempt to break up Russian troop concentrations near Mohacs failed.Far East.Burma and Siam.35. During the week ended dawn on the 5th, 2,545 sorties were flown, ofwhich 2,202 were by fighter-bombers and fighters. In addition transport aircraft flew 1,855 sorties, carrying 4,892 tons and 2,427 men, and evacuating 3,538 menand 675 casualties.   Nine Allied aircraft are missing.
In both the theatres of active military operations in Upper Burma, fighter-bombers and fighters operated daily against enemy positions and communications.To the east in the North Shan States and in the Salween area, Thunderboltsattacked bridges, workshops and dumps in the Lashio and Hsenwi districts,fires being raised on many occasions; aircraft from China also operated success-fully against similar targets in these localities, and in the Chefang and Wanlingareas.Hurricanes and Spitfires attacked targets in the Arakan, especially in thePaletwa and Kaiewan areas.In Central and Lower Burma an attack by Liberators resulted in much damage to rolling stock and installations at Pyinmana railway station; the rail-way stations at Pegu and Toungoo, and the jetty and bridge at Sagaing were also attacked... Mitchells carried out daily sorties against rail targets, in the courseof which considerable destruction was caused in railway yards and to bridgesin the Yamethin/Pyawbwe and Mytttha/Kume areas. Beaufighters made 2attacks on the airfield at Heho, where 8 hangars were damaged, and on the barracks at Pegu, while Thunderbolts destroyed the central spans of the railway bridge at Myitnge.Mergui harbour (Tennaserim) was attacked both by 45. Super Fortresses(830 tons) and. by 16 Liberators; results have not yet been reported.In Siam, 54 Super Fortresses bombed the Bansue railway yards at Bangkok(357 tons) with good to excellent results. In the course of this operation 6 enemy aircraft were shot down. Liberators made 81 successful sorties against bridgesand stations on the Bangkok-Chiengmai railway. The airfields at Lampang andChiengrai were attacked by aircraft of the United States XIV Air Force.China and French Indo-China.36. From the 28th November to the 1st December inclusive, a total of 319sorties was flown, of which 116 were by transport aircraft. One Allied aircraft is reported to be missing.Liberators, Mitchells and Mustangs operated against railway targets in and near Hanoi, the Phu Lang Thuong bridge (30 miles N.E. of Hanoi) and adjacent installations being successfully attacked on three occasions.In South China and Hainan, docks and installations at Kowloon (HongKong), Fort Bayard and Samah Bay were bombed daily by small numbers ofLiberators.In the provinces of Hunan and Kwangsi, Mustangs attacked the airfields at Paoching and Lungling,1 and troop concentrations in the Hochih area,while Kittynawks, operating north of Changsha, destroyed or damaged manyunits of rolling stock.Japan.37. The industrial area of Tokyo was bombed by 24 Super Fortresses (onemissing) which dropped 59 tons through cloud.Pacific.38. In the Philippines the airfield at Carolina and the landing-strip atDumaguette (both on Negros) were bombed by escorted Liberators. excellent results were obtained on the first-named target, while the landing-strip was wellcratered. Daliao (near Davao on Mindanao) was also attacked by Liberatorswith good results on two occasions, while further heavies of the same type dropped24 tons on Legaspi airfield (S.E. Luzon), machine-gunning the runway anddestroying a number of grounded aircraft. Similarly Matina airfield was twicebombed. .Sixty-eight Allied aircraft destroyed 3 vessels in Ormoc Bay during anattack on shipping, in the course of which 13 enemy aircraft, of a numberencountered, were destroyed and 4 others probably destroyed; this for the lossof a medium bomber and a fighter. A 7,000-ton vessel was bombed and sunk byKittyhawks off Masbate, while a large lugger was set on fire and the jetty rendered unservicable at Palompon (N.W. Leyte).Iwojima, in the Kazan Group, was attacked on 6 occasions by Liberatorsand Lightnings. Two landing-strips were bombed successfully and 3 inter-intercepting enemy aircraft destroyed.
In the Ogasawara Group, Mitchells attacked Ohichijima and Futami Hahawith R.P., while in the Celebes Liberators twice bombed the airfield at Kendari,obtaining direct hits on the runway, and successfully attacking buildings andbarracks at Malimpoeng and Pare Pare.. . Supply dumps and the jetty area at Kairiru, and A.A. gun positions and acamp near Wewak, in New Guinea, were bombed on two occasions during the week.In the Carolines, Avengers and Corsairs twice bombed the airfield and fueldumps at Ponape, and three times attacked a landing-strip at Yap and the airfield and an ammunition dump at Babelthuap.Jaluit, in the Marshalls, was also visited on two occasions by Allied bombers,as was Maloelap.In the marinas good results were obtained by Avengers and Corsairs whichbombed Rota and Pagan airfield on several occasions.In the course of enemy activity, the airfields at Isley and Foley (Saipan)were attacked, and one Super Fortress and 11 others were damaged (2 seriously)on the former airfield, while on the latter a Japanese aircraft deliberatelycrashed on another Super Fortress, which it destroyed. Thirteen of the enemy aircraft attacking were destroyed by fighters and A.A. Thirty enemy aircraftbombed and machine-gunned installations at Carigara in the Philippines, one being destroyed by A.A. Allied destroyers, while operating in the CamotesSea (W. of Leyte) suffered some damage from continued enemy air attacks.39. Except for a lull of about 30 hours at the beginning of the week theenemy has continued an intermittent attack on this country with long-rangerockets. There were 36 incidents (compared with 41 last week), of which 17 werein London, 17 in Essex, 1 in Suffolk and 1 in Kent.Flying bombs were used on a small scale in the evenings of the 4th and 5th.The total number plotted was 25, of which 3 were shot down by fighters and 2 byA.A. Of those which came overland 2 incidents are reported in Essex, 2 in Kent,all of a minor character, and 1 in Walthamstow which caused some damage to houses.40.
