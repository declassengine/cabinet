THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 750.l%th December, 1944WAR  CABINET.BELGIUM.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN view of the fact that there has been some tendency to compare thesituation in Belgium with that in Greece, the following appreciation of theposition in Belgium may be of interest.It will be recalled that, when Belgium fell before the German invader inMay 1940, King Leopold decided to share the fate of his army, of which he wasthe Commander-in-Chief. The Belgian Government, however, moved to France,and subsequently, when France collapsed, four members of the Government,namely, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Minister of Finance andthe Minister of the Colonies, succeeded in reaching this country. By the end of1940 M. Pierlot and his colleagues had properly established themselves on Britishsoil and were recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government as the legal and consti-tutional Government of Belgium, there being a provision under the BelgianConstitution whereby, if the Sovereign is incapacitated from performing his functions, the Government can act on his behalf. No serious attempt was evermade to challenge the constitutional status of the Belgian Government in exile.In September 1944, when Belgium had been almost completely liberated, theBelgian Government returned to their capital, the two Houses of parliament were reassembled and M. Pierlot rendered an account of his stewardship abroad.The Government then resigned according to their undertaking previouslybroadcast on several occasions to the Belgian people.Following M. Pierlots resignation, attempts were made to form analternative Government, but these efforts failed, and eventually, after somepressure, M. Pierlot reluctantly accepted the task of forming a new Government.M. Pierlots new Government embraced all parties. Only five of the newMinisters had been members of the Government in exile; two others had been inLondon during the war; the remaining twelve Ministers had all been in Belgiumthroughout the occupation. The new Government was appointed by PrinceCharles, who had himself been elected Regent by both Houses of Parliament, inaccordance with the provisions of the Constitution, and was supported by the overwhelming majority of the two Houses. (The composition of the Chamber of deputies, which was elected in April 1939, was : Catholics 73, Socialists 64,Liberals 33, and Communists 9. In addition, there were some 20 Rexist andFlemish Nationalist Deputies.)On the 16th November the two Communist Ministers and the Minister repre-senting the Front de V Independance resigned from the Government on the issueof the disbanding and disarming of the Resistance Movement.It may be useful at this point to elucidate the position as regards the Resist-ance Movement. The resistance forces were composed of three main elements :(a) VArmpe Secrete, (b) the Front de VIndependance, and (c) a number of mi seel -laneous groups, the most important from the&apos; military point of view beingGroup G, composed of several thousand technicians and experts. Of the two main groups, V Armee Secrete was essentially non-political. The Front de Vlnde-pendance, however, was avowedly Left-wing and under strong communist influence. It probably had the largest membership even under the occupation,but the position has been rather obscured owing to the fact that, after the liberation, it threw open its ranks to all comers and in some provinces thereby12609   [28865]Copy No.
trebled its membership. Inevitably former Rexists and V.N.V. adherents wereamongst the new recruits and probably a number of German agents provocateurs.When the Belgian Government, at the instance and with the full backing ofthe Supreme Commander, issued instructions for the disbandment and dis-armament of the resistance groups, VArraee Secrete and the majority of the miscellaneous groups referred to under (c) above, readily agreed. It was only theFront de VIndependance which at first shilly-shallied, eventually agreed to handover their arms to SHAEF officers, but in the&quot; event have only done so to the extentof about 50 per cent, of the estimated number of arms in their possession.On leaving the Government, the Communist Ministers set about organisingdemonstrations, one of which in Brussels culminated in a clash with the police onthe 25th November. The police were obliged to use fire-arms and a small numberof people were wounded. This incident was followed by an attempt to organisestrikes, but these, though widespread for a day or two, soon petered out. On the28th November M. Pierlot appealed to the Chamber of Deputies for special powersto deal with the situation and these were granted to him by a majority of116 votes against 12 with 6 abstentions.None the less the Pierlot Government, although it undoubtedly had the over-whelming majority of the country behind it in refusing to be intimidated by thethreats of the Front de VIndependan.ee and Communists, is not popular and is by no means firmly established. The great bulk of Walloon opinion is against it,except in the case of the extreme Right-wing Catholic and Liberal elements, andit depends for its existence on the support of Flanders, where the essentially moreconservative and temperate character of the people makes Socialists, ChristianDemocrats and Left-wing Liberals alike more reluctant to enter into any sort ofcombination with Communism. Discussions are believed to be proceeding behind the scenes for the replacement of M. Pierlot&apos;s Government by one based on a coalition of the Left, possibly under the Socialist, Van Acker. It remains to beseen whether the Catholic Party would work in with such a Government orwhether, it would go into opposition.The main causes of discontent with the Pierlot Government are its allegedfeebleness in the conduct of affairs and its failure to punish collaborationists.As regards the first point, it is worth noting that in contrast to France,where, as a result of Marshal Retain and M. Laval having driven a coach and four through the Constitution of the Third Republic, a new start from scratchhas had to be made, in Belgium the constitution and administration have remainedsubstantially intact. The Pierlot Government is thus faced with the difficult task of trying to modernise an existing structure. There is inevitably a reluctance to cut out old wood and cast adrift from prescribed forms. To some extent thisis in accord with the wishes of the Belgian people themselves, who (especially the Flemings) are stolid bourgeois strongly in favour of law and establishedorder. But there is undoubtedly excessjre^lack of initiative and drive on thepart of the Pierlot Government collectively and this is perhaps even more true of the civil service, which has been cut off for four years from contact with the outside world and is still apt to live in the world of 1940.None the less, the Belgian Government have a record of solid achievementbehind them. In the first place, law and order has been largely restored throughoutthe country, no mean achievement after four years under German occupation.Secondly^, they have put through measures of financial reform which are generally recognised to be extremely efficient from the technical point of view. By arranging for the exchange of the old notes for new ones, it had been hoped to check warprofiteering resulting from collaboration with the enemy and from the black market. It was also hoped by blocking accounts above a certain figure to reducethe ill-effects of the inflation arising out of the German occupation. If thesefinancial measures have not fully achieved their object, this has been largely due to the impossibility of bringing about a speedy restoration of a minimumsupply and circulation of goods as had been expected at the time when themeasures were devised. Thirdly, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfarehas introduced a draft of a decree law to complete the existing system of social insurance. It is hoped that the provisions of this law will come into effect onthe 1st January. The law provides inter alia for old age pensions, family allow-ances and holidays with pay. In addition, new measures are proposed for compulsory health insurance and unemployment insurance, which have hitherto been only on a voluntary basis. One of the first measures undertaken by theGovernment was to bring about a 60 per cent, rise in wages in agreement with theowners and the old trade union representatives.
Apart from these measures of broad policy, the Belgian Government aremaking a substantial practical contribution to the general war effort. Forinstance : (a) They are supplying 4,000 tons of fruit and vegetables a month for theAllied forces.(b) Ten million pounds&apos; worth of industrial products a month are on order for the Allied forces.(c) 900,000 tons of coal a month are being provided for military and essential needs..(d) Complete control and use of transportation by railway and canal havebeen handed over to the Allied authorities, primarily for militarytraffic.(e) Full requirements of civil labour for docks and other military require-ments are being furnished.(/) Accommodation on a generous scale is being supplied for military purposes.A more substantial grievance, however, against the Government than itsalleged lack of drive is its failure to deal with the collaborationists. So far only two collaborationists are understood to have been executed and these were people in very humble circumstances. By the 24th November, some 900 sentences hadbeen passed as against some 70,000 cases of detainees awaiting trial. In thegreat majority of these sentences the persons concerned were outright traitors andquislings, e.g., members of the Waffen S.S. and men of small&quot; significance at that.No economic collaborationists are so far known to have been brought to trial andone or two have actually been released from custody. This is causing extremebitterness far beyond the ranks of the resistance groups.The failure of the Government to deal with the collaborationists may beascribed, in the first instance, to its dependence on the support of two distinctschools of thought which were strongly opposed to each other during the occupa-tion, and have been thoroughly suspicious of one another&apos;s intentions ever since.They are respectively those who in the interests of Belgium advocated a consider-able amount of passive but a minimum of active resistance to the Germans untilthe hour of liberation itself, and those who continually tried to increase thevolume of active resistance despite the&quot; growing savagery of the German terrormachine. Two other factors no doubt influence the Government. The first is thegreat strength of the Societe Generale, which corresponds to some extent to theComite des Forges in France; and, secondly, the influence which is being exertedby the Catholic Church in the direction of extreme leniency.With good luck and reasonable flexibility and adroitness on the part of theBelgian politicians, there is no reason why Belgium, given the good sense of theaverage Belgian citizen, should not overcome her internal differences without undue disturbance or disorder. But a very great deal will depend on theprovision through the coming winter of adequate supplies of food, fuel and rawmaterials. If the people have to go hungry and cold and if there is massunemployment, the position may easily deteriorate rapidly and catastrophically.But granted a tolerable standard of nutrition and employment, Belgium, with thegreat port of Antwerp intact and with comparatively little reconstruction workto carry out, despite some attention now from V-weapons, can look forward tothe future with confidence.It is pleasant to record in conclusion that British prestige standsexcepJign^JJUjEwhigh in Belgium and that relations between the British forces in belgium and the Belgian population are extremely friendly. The BelgianMinister for Foreign Affairs, M. Spaak, has repeatedly made it clear that Anglo-Belgian friendship is the corner-stone of Belgian foreign policy.A. E.Foreign Office, 19th December, 1944.
