THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET. Copy No.    ^ yW.P. (44) 713.20th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.ORGANISATION OF SUPPLY.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Machinery of Government Committee.1. The Machinery of Government Committee have given careful, considera-tion, in consultation with all Ministers concerned, to the post-war organisation for procuring Government Supply,* on the basis of a study by officials setting outthe arguments for and against various alternative plans, t2. The crucial part of the problem is whether the responsibility for pro-curing the main warlike stores required by the Armed Forces should rest with theService Departments or with a separate Supply Department or Departments :other important questions are involved but for the most part they depend fortheir solution on the decision taken regarding the main warlike stores.3. On this fundamental question the Committee have not been able to recorda unanimous view, and they therefore submit alternative recommendations to theWar Cabinet for decision. They are, however, agreed on the followingpreliminary propositions : (a) A decision on this matter is urgently required.   It would be undesirable to make any radical change in the existing arrangements before theend of the war with Japan; but any changes decided on should beintroduced as soon as possible thereafter, in order (i) that practical experience of war-time conditions may be brought to bear, and (ii) thatthe greatest possible time may be available for the new organisation to find its feet, and be adjusted if necessary after experience, before any danger of war is again upon us. Moreover, it is impossible forthe Departments concerned to offer permanent retention to first-classmen from the commercial and scientific worlds who are now beginning to think of their future, unless they know what the organisation isto be.(b) The peace-time organisation should correspond as closely as possible inform, though not in scale, to the organisation that will be required inwar, in order that major dislocations at a critical time may be avoided.(c) Whatever the plan adopted, the problems of research, design, development and production should be given a much more important place than was the case before this war : the organisation for procuring supplies should contain a large proportion of civilian personnel of high quality,capable of dealing at first hand with the industries in question andappreciating their practical problems; and this organisation mustcarry its proper weight in those counsels where high policy is decided.The question is whether these things can be achieved by an organisa-tion which is part of a Service Department or whether it must beplaced in a Supply Department under a separate Minister.id) Our war potential must be carefully planned in peace-time, and contractpolicy handled accordingly, in order that war-time expansion may beachieved with the maximum speed, smoothness and economy of resources.(e) Whatever plan is adopted, it would be essential that the Governmentshould institute a stringent review after, say, five years, in order tosee whether the plan as a whole was securing the advantages, and* M.G.

avoiding the dangers, which are said to attach to it: any necessarymodifications would then be made in the knowledge that the system had been deliberately put on trial.4. The alternatives presented to the War Cabinet may be called the &quot; service department basis &apos;&apos; and &quot;the &apos;&apos; Supply Department basis &apos;&apos; respectively. . TheCommittee have considered a wealth of argument on both sides, and in thefollowing paragraphs only the most important features are presented.The Service Department Basis.5.   The plan recommended on this basis is briefly as follows : (a) The Service Departments should themselves be responsible, both in peace and in &quot;war, for at any rate the major supplies of the respectiveFighting Services.(b) The necessary co-ordination of Service programmes and planning and allocation of industrial resources should be carried out in peace-time by a strong inter-departmental organisation under the aegis of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on which the Service Departments andthe Board of Trade would be represented. This organisation wouldbe the nucleus of a Ministry of Production which should come into being, not merely during war but during intensive preparatoryrearmament, as a co-ordinating Department with the responsibilityfor settling priorities and controlling and allocating productionresources.(c) Less important supplies should be the responsibility of the service departments in peace-time with an extension of the practice of agencypurchase by the most appropriate Department (Service or Civil); butin war-time, in order to ease the Service Departments&apos; burden and tosecure co-ordination between production for Service and for civilian. * needs, responsibility for these supplies might be centralised and form part of the task of the Ministry of Production.(d) Responsibility for procuring supplies required by Civil Departments,which in the main now rests with the General Post Office, the Ministryof Works and His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office, should remain as it is.6. This plan is supported by the Minister of Production, the Minister ofSupply and the three Service Ministers. It appears at first sight to be littledifferent from the arrangements adopted between the wars which, admittedly,fell short of requirements, and its adoption must necessarily be accompanied bya substantial change of organisation and outlook in the Service Departments.This change the Service Ministers say they are determined to accomplish. TheOther essential changes would be that more importance should attach to theorganisation (in the shape of a nucleus Ministry of Production.under the segisof the C.I.D.) for securing co-ordination and planning of our war potential inpeace-time, and that the creation of a Ministry of Production (whose functions would include some functions of the present Ministry of Supply, e.g., on rawmaterials) should be the first instead of the last administrative step taken tomeet war needs.7.   The following are suggested to be the main advantages of the plan :  (i) It facilitates a thorough acquaintance on the part of uniformedofficers with the problems of design, development and supply andsecures the complete integration at the highest professional level ofthe user and procurement interests. These things are held by theService Ministers and the Minister of Production to be vital to thefuture efficiency of the Forces.(ii) No amount of inter-Departmental co-operation can be as effective asresponsibility to a single Minister in securing co-ordination betweenuser and producer : this is even more true in peace than in war. TheAdmiralty&apos;s experience shows that the burden is not too heavy for asingle Minister, even in war-time, if suitable arrangements are madefor the general co-ordination both of strategy and of production.(iii) The arrangements should be sufficiently flexible to enable speciallydifficult problems to be dealt with on special lines, without sacrificingthe main advantages of the plan.(iv) The transition from  a peace-time to a war-time basis would besmoother than under the other plan.
(v) The plan avoids the institution, in peace-time, of a  Minister  withco-ordinating authority over other Cabinet Ministers; and also keepsto a minimum the number of Ministers in the service and supplysphere with claims to seats in the peace-time Cabinet.(vi) It may be noted that, though Parliament pressed strongly for a Ministryof Supply before the war, the Select Committee on national expenditure have recorded the view that the transfer to a Ministryof Supply of responsibility for procuring technical instruments ofwar for the Army has revealed most serious disadvantages and shouldnot continue.(vii) A Ministry confined to the procurement of supplies would in peace-timehave a status very different from that which it occupies under thestress of war. It might tend to become a poor and humdrum affair,enjoying neither glamour and prestige in the eyes of Parliament andthe public, nor the services of first-rate business and scientific men,civil servants and Ministers, nor, perhaps the confidence of theService Departments. This might import an element of real weaknessinto our defence preparations which would be difficult to remedy intime of need.8. There is one special point to be made on this plan. The problem ofsecuring a proper balance between the needs of different Departments regardingthe supply of aircraft is particularly difficult: and if the War Cabinet decidegenerally in favour of the &quot; Service Department basis,&quot; which would imply theabolition of the Ministry of Aircraft Production, the Ministers concerned shouldbe invited to consider together, within this general decision, what arrangements could best be made to achieve a satisfactory result, reporting their conclusions tothe War Cabinet for endorsement.The Supply Department Basis.9. Under this plan there would be, in peace-time, a single comprehensiveSupply Department responsible (a) for procuring all the supplies required by the Army and Royal Air Forceand all supplies required by the Royal Navy except actual warships and marine engines (including, that is, naval aircraft, guns andtorpedoes as well as less important stores);(b) for discharging, in close consultation with the Board of Trade, thefunctions assigned in peace-time under the other plan (para. 5 (&amp;)above) to the nucleus Ministry of Production;(c) for procuring as large a proportion of Civil Supplies as might be foundconvenient.10. In war-time, because of this Ministry&apos;s large scope, it might be foundnecessary to split it into two or three Ministries &apos;for instance a Ministry of aircraft Production, a Ministry serving the other needs of the Armed Forces,and a co-ordinating Ministry of Production.11. This plan, which is supported by the Minister of Aircraft Productionand the President of the Board of Trade, closely resembles the plan recommendedby the Haldane Committee for introduction after the last war. The followingarguments are put forward in its favour : (i) Experience of two wars has shown that, in war-time, the productionof the instruments of war has to be separated from the administrationof the Armed Forces; and there should be a similar separation inpeace.(ii) The vastly increased importance of industrial effort as a war factorrequires much closer attention to the peace-time planning of industrialwar potential.(iii) The whole outlook of a Service Department is dominated, and rightlyso, by the Staff. Senior staff officers, though they may have considerabletechnical experience, have only rarely had extensive contacts with industry on its development and production sides, and even morerarely on its commercial side. The greatest interest, and the greatesttalent, tend naturally to turn towards those branches of the service which offer the highest professional rewards. These factors, togetherwith Service discipline and traditions, make the atmosphere of a service Department unsuited to the adequate expression of what are essentially civilian considerations relating to research and production.
(iv) What is wanted is not so much complete integration, as a proper balance,between user and production interests, and it is unrealistic to expectthis except by means of a separate Department under an independentMinister.(v) Such a Department would avoid any division of effort in research onsubjects of interest to more than one of the Armed Forces, and wouldalso avoid any difficulties over, for instance, radio and aircraft, since in such matters it would naturally minister to the needs not only ofall the Armed Forces but also of civil aviation.12. Those who support this plan would urge that even if the War Cabinefsgeneral feeling is in favour of the &quot;Service Department basis&quot; an exceptionshould be made in the case of aircraft. The air problem is of overriding impor-tance in modern war, and it is particularly dependent on rapidity of technicaladvance : moreover, aircraft are required by all three Fighting Services andalso for civil air transport. To secure the best balance between competing needs,and the best utilisation of our aircraft industry, requires not only full under-standing of the problems involved but also full impartiality : for this a separateSupply Department is essential, and a Ministry of Aircraft Production shouldbe retained in peace-time, even if other supplies for the Armed Forces areentrusted to the Service Departments.13. The Machinery of Government Committee ask the War Cabinet, asa matter, of urgency,(a) to record a general decision as between the two alternative bases set out above.(b) to invite the Ministers concerned to proceed at once with the planning. necessary to enable the approved arrangements to come into operation at the end of the Japanese war, reporting as necessary to the WarCabinet.(Initialled) J.
