gJLP RETg-p. (hU) 7hh^RTH DECEMBER ,  1 9hhWAR CABINETAPPLICATION BY PR,  NEC-RIN FOR EXI3?PERMIT TO GO TO FRANCEMemorandum By the Secretary,of State, for Foreign AffairsThe Home Secretary,  in his memorandum,,W.P.(hh) 725 of12th December, recommends that Dr. Negrinhs application for anexit permit to go to France should he approved on the grounds that Dr. Ne.gr.in is a responsible person and that we have at this time no need to fear the displeasure of General Franco.2. Although I shall he called upon to explain our decisionto the Spanish Ambassador,  who has already approached theForeign Office,      I entirely agree with the Home Secretary thatthere is no need to fear the displeasure of General Franco.I am opposed to the granting of an exit visa because  (1)  thepurpose for which Dr.  Negrin wishes to go to France cannot hecertified as urgent Business of national importance, especially when visits By Members of Parliament and other British subjectsare so severely controlled and (2) the only tangible result ofsuch a visit would probably he to,cause alarm In all circles in spain at a possible recurrence of revolutionary disturbances andso to strengthen General Franco&apos;s position, a development v/hichwould Be contrary to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. I should add that Dr.  Negrin is only one of many exiledSpanish Republican politicians, all of whom are in violentdisagreement with one another and most of whom are completelydiscredited in Spain.      Dr.  Negrin himself has little following,and in support of this I quote from Mr. Yemen Bartlett&apos;sarticle in the News Chronicle of 12th December:    &quot;Spaniardsin exile - with the exception of Indalecio Prieto,  the moderateSocialists leader&apos;, and perhaps Pi y Saner, the Catalonian -have very little following.      I express this conviction with regret&quot;.      Mr. Vernon Bartlett cannot Be described as a witnesshostile to the Spanish Republicans and yet his views are inagreement with those repeatedly expressed by H.M. Embassy in madrid/      If facilities were to be granted to Dr. Negrin to visit France, we should have to expect requests for similar-facilities from the many other exiled Spanish politicians, most,of whom are Bitterly opposed to Senor Negrin.k. I did not of course oppose Dr.  Negrinhs  journey toMexico and the U.S.A. , as this would not take him nearer to spain and so have a disturbing effect in Spain and  on   Anglo-Spanish relations.A.E.r-eign Office, S W. 1 . ,1Sth December, 19hh.COPY NO.WDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
