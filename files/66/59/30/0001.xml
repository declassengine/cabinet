THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 730.29th December, 1944REPORT POR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1944 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.THE main political problem which faced the Canadian Government during november was the question of conscription for overseas service with the CanadianArmy. The first indication that all was not well was the announcement on the2nd5 November that Colonel Ralston had resigned his post as Minister of NationalDefence and that he had been replaced by General McNaughton. The point a tissue was whether an adequate supply of reinforcements for the Army overseascould be obtained under the voluntary system which has hitherto prevailed, orwhether the conscription powers which have not so far been used should now be invoked to ensure this supply. The Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King, wasnot convinced that no alternative to conscription could be found. Opposition to conscription comes mainly from Quebec, and the Liberal newspapers were preparedfor compulsory overseas service if that were necessary.2. The Conservative ppposition continued to press for unqualifiedconscription, -and Mr. Mackenzie King accordingly summoned Parliament tomeet on the 22nd November in order to ask for a vote of confidence.3. On the 23rd November, the Prime Minister announced that an Order-in-Council had been passed extending the area in which 16,000 drafted men mayserve. This, in practice, meant that these men could now be sent out of Canada.General McNaughton explained that it was the intention of the Government tomaintain the voluntary system to the limit, but 5,000 additional trained infantry-men must be available early in December to safeguard the reinforcement positionof the Canadian armies abroad at the end of January. As a result of this announcement, Mr. Power, Minister for Air and Parliamentary Member forQuebec South, announced his resignation.4. Speaking in Parliament in the Debate, Colonel Ralston said that hewould support the Government, and urged that the Progressive-Conservativeamendments for unqualified conscription should not be adopted, in order that nothing should delay the despatch of the 16,000 Home Defence men overseas.After a heated debate, the vote of confidence was taken and resulted in a majorityof two to one for the Government, 143 votes to 70.5.   The Seventh Victory Loan has been substantially over-subscribed.Service Activities.6. On the night of the 12th/13th H.M.C.S. Algonquin, in company with .M.S. Kent and Bellona, took part in the destruction of a convoy off ListerFjord, Norway.[28904]Copy No.WAR CABINET.
7. On the 21st, H.M. Canadian frigate Joliette grounded and was damaged in Lough Foyle.8. H.M. Canadian corvette Shawinigan is overdue and presumed sunk. Shewas escorting a local convoy and is believed to have been torpedoed by a U-boatN.E. of Gape Breton.9. H.M. Canadian destroyers Sioux and Algonquin formed part of an escortto H.M.S. Implacable in an air attack on convoys off the Norwegian coast onthe 25th.10. During the first half of November all the three operations mentioned inthe last report, in which the First Canadian Army was engaged, were successfullyconcluded..11. On the 2nd, Knocke was captured and the following day all resistancesouth of the Scheldt ceased. Since the crossing of the Leopold Canal over 14,000prisoners had been taken in this sector. By the evening of the 2nd the causewayleading to the island of Walcheren had been forced, and by the 10th the remnantsof the German garrison in the island had been finally eliminated. The ScheldtEstuary was now completely cleared on both banks and the approaches to Antwerpfreed from interference from German land forces. In fact, minesweepers hadalready entered the estuary as early as the 4th.12. The main objects of this offensive by the first Canadian Army havingbeen achieved, a considerable reshuffling took place in the 21st Army Group.Broadly speaking the United Kingdom portion of the Army Group, with certainUnited States formations attached, took over the front from Arnhem southwardsfacing East, while the Canadians held a front running East to West fromArnhem to the sea facing North and securing the left flank of 21st Army Groupfor further operations towards the Meuse.13. The fighting in Italy on the Eighth Army front south of Highway and between this road and the Adriatic might be described as stubborn but notspectacular. The actual forward advance by our troops was only about ten milesduring the month, but every yard had to be fought for against strong german resistance aided by rain, swollen streams and tactical flooding carried out by theenemy of the area south of Ravenna. All this country is intersected by numerousstreams running down from the Apennines at right angles to Our line of advance;these streams, although normally small and narrow, were converted by continuousrain into broad swift-flowing torrents, washing away military bridgesand floodingthe surrounding country until any movement by armoured vehicles and evenunarmoured motor vehicles became practically impossible. It was with suchconditions that the 1st Canadian Corps had to contend throughout the month.,but their operations, besides effecting a useful although limited advance, forcedthe enemy to employ troops he would have probably preferred to use elsewhereand inflicted continuous and by no means negligible casualties.   &apos;14. 44 R.C.A.F. Squadrons were operational overseas during the monthof November : 25 in the United Kingdom, 17 on the Continent, one in Italy andone in Ceylon.15. Heavy bombers of No. 6 (R.C.A.F.) Group flew over 2,000 sorties duringthe month; these were slightly less than during October mainly owing to adverse weather conditions. Losses totalled 28 aircraft compared with 16 in the previous month. Targets were factories, oil refineries and marshalling yards in western germany and tactical targets in support of the Allied armies. From the 1st tothe 22nd inclusive, five enemy fighters were claimed destroyed.16. Beaufighters,- Sunderlands and Wellingtons, of R.C.A.F. CoastalSquadrons flew over 1,500 operational hours; no aircraft were lost. activity was below normal and no enemy submarines were sighted. Beaufighters ofNo. 404 Squadron, in company with certain R.A.F. Squadrons, attacked convoyson two occasions resulting in one merchant ship being beached and three others damaged; two coasters were sunk and two escort vessels damaged.17. R.C.A.F. Squadrons of 2nd Tactical Air Force flew 3,525 sorties, whichwas little more than half the number flown during October. 23 aircraft are missing from these operations; 12 German aircraft were destroyed.18. One aircraft is missing from the three Canadian Squadrons of fighter command.  No. 418 Mosquito Squadron shot down two enemy aircraft.
19. No. 437 R.C.A.F. Squadron of Transport Command was engaged incarrying supplies from the United Kingdom to the Continent. Nos. 435 and 436Transport Squadrons are forming at R.C.A.F. Station, Gujrat, India. TheCanadian Catalina Squadron in Ceylon had no particular incidents during themonth and lost no aircraft. The same applies to the R.C.A.F. Fighter Squadronlocated in Italy.Economic.Copper Contracts.20. Producers in Canada, the Union of South Africa and Northern Rhodesiawith whom the Ministry of Supply have contracts expiring on the 31st January,1945, were informed towards the end of October that the Ministry had decided not to renew their contracts for a further period. This decision was taken on supply grounds.21. Representatives of the producers in all these countries are now in theUnited Kingdom and have had discussions with the Ministry of Supply regarding their future position.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.22. Widespread unrest in industry continues, with demands for a furtherrevision of wages. Strikes are said to be seriously affecting the war effort as wellas the position of the Government.23. The Commonwealth Governments proposal to nationalise the australian -lian air services came as a shock to the business and professional community : onthe other hand, some sections feel that, as the Airway companies are only able to operate by Government subsidies, they can see no difference between Governmentownership of railways and of airways.24. The Government has been criticised for failing to plan to meet suchdisasters as the ravages occasioned by the drought, which have been increased byappalling bush fires. These disasters mean that Australia would be unable tomeet her world-wide commitments in the matter of food production.25. The Minister of Information, Mr. Calwell, recently accused two HighCourt Judges of partiality when adjudicating last May on the censorship dispute between the Minister and the Sydney newspapers. This formed one of five countson which Mr. Menzies, leader of the Opposition, based a motion of censure, whichwas lost on a purely Party division.26. Speaking in the House of Representatives on the 30th November aboutthe Australia-New Zealand Conference held at Wellington, the Minister of external Affairs outlined the objectives at which both countries had aimed, and,after summarising the principal topics discussed, said, with reference to the pacific area, that it would be wrong to contend that either country can have an exclusive concern with the future of any part of the Pacific region. But great and constructive work could be done by the particular Government which was respon-sible for territories in the South Seas. The Conference had proposed the settingup of a South Seas Regional Commission with a view to its operation in 1945.This Commission should consist of representatives of all Governments andadministrations in the region, and have a permanent Secretariat, as well asresearch and other bodies established by the various Governments on the advice of the Commission. Australia and New Zealand were now in consultation withthe United Kingdom Government about this matter.Service Activities.27. One Frigate for the Royal Australian Navy was launched on the31st October and another on the 4th November.28. In accordance with the Governments decision to release Army personnel to industry a total of 27,823 were discharged between the 1st November, 1943, andthe 25th November, 1944.29. Total strength of United States forces (Army and Air Corps) in South-West Pacific Area on the 8th November was 757,774 including 138,304 of the AirCorps.[28904] B 2
NEW ZEALAND.30. The announcement of the agreed meat prices for the coming season hashad a favourable press, and the fact that the Government has made it clear thatpayments by Great Britain will be retained for the eventual use of meat producershas been welcomed. New Zealand producers may be in a position to make up the deficiencies in Australian exports to the United Kingdom of foodstuffs, thesedeficiencies now being inevitable as a result of the prolonged drought in Australia.31. A resolution passed at a recent Labour Party Conference, recom-mending that the Government should consider the complete nationalisation of theBank of New Zealand by acquiring the shares in private ownership, has arousedmuch interest. It has been suggested that a compulsory acquisition of the shares would tend to discredit the financial status of the Dominion.32. At a recent by-election, the National candidate was returned by 4,600votes against the Labour candidate&apos;s 2,500. This result is taken by the press toindicate that opinion in the country has swung substantially against theGovernment.Service Activities.33. The strength of United States Forces in New Zealand on the1st September, 1944, was 2,513.34. To the end of October 1944, 56,341 Service men and women had beendemobilised in New Zealand, 31,687 of this number having served overseas.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.35. The opposition of Indians resident in Natal to the draft Ordinancecontrolling the acquisition and occupation of residential property by Indianscame to a head during November, and led to the promulgation by the Governmentof India of regulations imposing upon South Africans in India the samedisabilities regarding entry, residence, trade, local franchise, and the acquisition and holding of property as are imposed on Indians in South Africa. In anattempt to find a way out of the difficulties, the Prime Minister, Field-marshal smuts, has informed the Natal Indian Congress that he regards the residential property Regulation Ordinance as not being strictly in accordance with- the&quot;Pretoria Agreement.&quot; The situation has thus reverted to what it was inMarch.36. The Prime Minister has since decided to advise the Acting Governor-General to withhold his sanction to the Ordinance and the Prime Minister willtake up the whole matter in the Union Parliament as if neither the &apos;&apos; PretoriaAgreement&apos;&apos; had been concluded nor the Ordinance passed, in the hope that asatisfactory way can be found out of an admittedly complex position.37. In reply to renewed criticism of the food shortage in the Union, theMinister of Agriculture, Mr.. Strauss, has explained that the local shortage isdue to the demands of the United Nations.38. Mr. Sturrock, the Minister of Transport, has announced an agreement in general terms between the United Kingdom and South African governments for a joint air service between Britain and South Africa after the war.39. The largest average increase in the cost of living in the Union, so farrecorded during this war, was shown in the figures for October to be 30 per cent,above the 1938 level in the nine principal urban centres. -40. Mr. G. Heaton Nicholls, Administrator of Natal since 1943, has beenappointed High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa in London in succession to the late Colonel Reitz.Economic.41. A supply Mission consisting of senior members of the Union Director-General of Supplies Organisation is at present visiting this country, havingpreviously been to the United States and Canada.
42. The purpose of the Mission is partly to enquire into immediate supplymatters and partly to discuss the prospective supply position after the end of theEuropean war, with particular reference to the United Kingdom Government&apos;sexport policy during the transition period. The Mission is also interested inrecent housing developments in this country, and in the supply of building materials and fittings required for implementing the Union Government&apos;housing programme.43. Since their arrival, the members of the Mission have been received bythe Minister of Supply and the Parliamentary Secretary of the Department of overseas Trade, and have had a series of discussions on supply, shipping and related matters, with officials of all the Departments concerned. Individual&apos;members of the Mission are at present visiting firms in various parts of thecountry.44. Under the Export of Goods (Control) (No. 2) Order, 1944, made bythe Board of Trade on the 13th November and operative as from the18th November, the Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia were removed from the list of destinations to which the export of &quot; all &quot; goods from the. UnitedKingdom is subject to licence.45. Licences are still, of course, required for the export &quot;to the Union ofSouth Africa and Southern Rhodesia of goods specified in the schedule to theExport Control Order.EIRE.46. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs gavein the House of Commons on the 14th November the substance of the Eire Govern-menfs reply to the recent approach which was made to them (actually by theUnited States Minister in Dublin, the request being subsequently supported bythe United Kingdom Representative there) requesting them not to harbour Axiswar criminals. Mr. Emrys Evans said that the Eire Government had statedthat in their view the right to grant asylum is not in question, and that theycould give no assurance which would preclude them from exercising that rightshould justice, charity or the honour or interest of the nation so require. they also referred to the absence of a comprehensive international code applicable tothe matter and to the lack of a generally recognised court or procedure for thejudicial determination of individual cases. They went on to say that, on theother hand, since the present war began, it has been the uniform practice of the eire Government to deny admission to all aliens whose presence would be at variance with the policy of neutrality, or detrimental to the interests of the irish people, or inconsistent with the desire of the Irish people to avoid injury to theinterests of friendly States, and that when such aliens land they are deportedto their countries of origin as soon as possible. They stated that it is not intendedto alter this practice.47. Mr. Emrys Evans added that the United Kingdom Government fortheir part wished to make it clear that, it would certainly, in the words used bythe Eire Government, be &apos;&apos; detrimental to the interests of the Irish people &apos;&apos; werewar criminals to be harboured in Eire. The United States State Departmentspublished comment said, &quot; We were glad to have the assurances of the Irishreply, but it did not go as far as we would have liked in all particulars.&quot;48. At a meeting of the Trinity College Historical Society, Mr. de Valeragave his views on the problem of guaranteeing peace after the war. He saidthat he was afraid that in the conditions of the world, as they had been andwere likely to continue for some time to come, it was not possible to build up an organisation which could really guarantee peace, not to speak of an organisation which could give peace and at the same time leave to small nations their libertyand independence to live their own lives in their own way under conditions whichthey required. He believed that the only solution which would guarantee peacewas one of a Universal World State, and that until such a coercive power was at the disposal of some central world authority which could be used to preventaggression of all kinds they would not, and could not, have an effective instru-ment for the maintenance of peace. The League of Nations, in his view, failedbecause the Great Powers failed to see eye to eye.  The difference between war
for the maintenance of order and peace against an aggressor and a conflict between States was very great. He would like to see continental countries gettingtheir own ancestral territory and left free to develop it.49. Following Mr. de Valera was Dr. Jan Masaryk, who observed that smallnations could never be destroyed but would un^i^pJ^yriS-e again, and thatsmall nations have rarely contrived to create foT*ttieTflBWveTsuch guarantees of security that they need not seek the support of large units. He said that thisholds good in politics; in economics, and partially also in cultural matters.50. Dr. Masaryk was to have read a paper to the Irish Institute for Inter-national Affairs on the 3rd November, but the Eire Government intervened.Pressed in the Dail for reasons for the intervention, Mr. de Valera replied thatit was a well-recognised principle that, when a Minister of the Government ofone State was invited to address a group of citizens within the territory of another, the Government of the latter State should be informed beforehand and given an opportunity of expressing its assent. In this case, he said, nO noticewas received from the group that issued the invitation. The Czech Consul was told that in the circumstances the Government did not wish the lecture to begiven.51. Criticising the Institute, Mr. de Valera said that it had become a focusof propaganda to foster a certain point of view on the war, and that it simplyprovided ammunition for people abroad to say that neutrality was forced onthe people. Such a position, he said, could not be countenanced by any Govern-ment worthy of the name.52. Addressing the Annual Congress of the Fine Gael in Dublin, GeneralMulcahy advocated a defensive military alliance with Great Britain. He saidthat, geographically, economically, socially, and politically, the interests of Eirewere so closely entwined with those of Great Britain that it is inconceivable thatEire could take its place in any security scheme in which Great Britain was not included. Everything, he told the Congress, they have seen in this war shouldconvince them that their security can be planned only in combination with somepowerful ally or combination of allies- competent to shield them with their power, and to guarantee to their man-power in time of war the weapons andequipment which they cannot hope to provide from their own production and resources. He went on to say that, even in a world combination such as the newLeague of Nations, they could not fail to realise that the security of GreatBritain and themselves is completely interdependent. The necessary preliminary,therefore, to any entry of Eire into either discussions or decisions before joiningin a world combination of military security should be discussion and decisions with Great Britain for the mutual defence of their two countries. GeneralMulcahy concluded by saying that it is desirable in their interests that GreatBritain should see realistically what the future holds, and that Eire can helpher in that only by being realistic themselves.53. Speaking at a meeting of the Technical Students&apos; Debating Society,Mr. Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce and Supplies, admitted thatduring the war Eire had lost most of its hold on the British market for agricultural produce. He said that only a very considerable improvement in methods ofproduction and marketing would give Eire a fighting chance. The position of eire after the war, he said, will not be fundamentally different from that ofGreat Britain. Unlike the British, Eire will emerge from the war period withinflated external assets, but almost entirely in the form of sterling balances.He went on to say that it is improbable that for a number of years after thewar these sterling assets&quot; will be freely convertible into other currencies, to permit of purchase outside the sterling area, and there has as yet been no indication of the extent to which British policy will permit of their utilisation to purchase in Great Britain the new productive equipment, raw materials and consumers&apos;goods that Eire needs.54. Trade statistics for October, issued by the Department of Industry and commerce, show that the total value of Eire&apos;s exports amounted to  3,428,791,compared with  3,133,785 in the corresponding month of 1943. Imports werevalued at  3,025,357, almost double the amount for October 1943. Of the total exports for the month, live-stock amounted to  2,117,504 ( 2,056,538 inOctober 1943), and imports were  24,928, compared with  28,970 in October 1943.Food, drink and tobacco exports totalled  971,656 ( 718,739 in IMS); imports 1,050.911 ( 497,641 in October 1943).
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.. Political.55. The revival of the Congress organisation and the building up ofcontacts lost since 1942 seem to be the primary objects of Mr. Gandhi&apos;programme of constructive work for Congressmen, published at the end ofOctober, in which he gives detailed guidance for future work, particularly inrespect of education and welfare, among peasants, the labouring classes, and students. &quot;What direction his own future activities are to take is not yetapparent.56. The political development of most interest in November wasSir Tej Bahadur Sapru&apos;s announcement that he had been authorised by theStanding Committee of the Non-Party Leaders&apos; Conference to appoint acommittee to examine the whole communal and minority question from theconstitutional and political point of view, putting itself in touch with thedifferent parties and their leaders, and to present a solution within two months.He said that the proposal had resulted from his recent talks with Mr. Gandhi,who approved of it. The proposal has aroused much interest in India, and inreply to a question in the Council of State the Government spokesman said thatthe Government of India would give sympathetic consideration to any request from the Committee for assistance.57. The grievances of Indians in South Africa were discussed in bothchambers of the Indian Legislature during November. Early in the month theGovernment of India had already used the power conferred by recent legislation to announce that South Africans in India would be subjected to the samedisabilities as Indians in South Africa. The strength of Indian feeling on thismatter was shown in the debates in the Legislature, in which Government were pressed to go further, recall the Indian High Commissioner, and impose an embargo on trade with South Africa. Meanwhile, Field-Marshal Smuts was believed to be engaged in seeking a solution. He received a deputation of SouthAfrican Indians to discuss the situation.Foreign and Frontier Relations.58. Afghanistan. The&apos; Afghan Government have announced theirrecognition of Syrian and Lebanese independence. They also telegraphed to theMinister of Foreign Affairs in Paris suggesting a resumption of diplomatic relations with the French Government.59. In sending instructions to their Minister at Washington regarding theAir Conference, they directed him to inform the Americans that, if they wishedto inaugurate a civil air service to China, the Afghan Government would beready to grant them the necessary facilities.60.   Internally, the situation remained quiet.61. North-West Frontier. The Frontier remained quiet during the month,though bombing had to be undertaken against one Madda Khel village in orderto persuade the Tribe to evict Mazrak from their territory. The bombing was successful and resulted in Mazrak crossing the border into Afghanistan. TheFaqir of Ipi showed little activity.62. Tibet. At a further formal interview, the Tibetan authorities .informed Sir Basil Gould that they were determined to do everything in their power to preserve the integrity of Tibet, and that, despite their relative weaknessas compared with the Chinese, they were prepared to do their utmost even tothe extent of fighting, provided that they could be assured that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Government of India would &quot;see them through.&quot;Sir Basil Gould was instructed to reply that it would be impossible to give anysuch implied guarantee of military support against a country with whom weare allied, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government trusted that the situation wouldnot be allowed to develop in such a way as to lead to a resort to force. He wasto point out that the fact that China is our Ally places us in a particularly
favourable position to use our influence with the Chinese by diplomatic means to assist towards the reaching of a satisfactory solution by peaceful methods.The Tibetans had also asked for a postponement of the Government of India&apos;operations to establish their position on the McMahon Boundary Line whilediscussions were in progress with the Chinese over the major question of Tibet&apos;sstatus. Sir Basil Gould was instructed to make it clear to the Tibetans that wecould not forgo our Treaty rights and were not prepared to withdraw fromposts that had already been permanently established. At the same time he wasto hint at a readiness on our part to agree to some modification of the boundaryin the Tawang Area, where there is an important monastery. When he had carried out these instructions, Sir Basil Gould was to return to India.63. . Persian Gulf. The assassination of Lord Moyne excited strong anti-Jewish feeling.63a. In Muscat, the Bicentenary of the Al Bu Said Dynasty was celebratedon the 20th November. (This Dynasty is common to the rulers of both Muscatand Zanzibar, the separation of the two States having taken place in 1861.)Messages of congratulation were sent to the Sultan by His Majesty The King,the Secretary of State and the Viceroy. It will be recalled that in return fora subsidy, the Sultan of Muscat has provided us with a number of war-timefacilities in his territory, particularly for the R.A.F.Economic.64. Railway Equipment. The problem of meeting India&apos;s additional requirements of 318 broad-gauge locomotives and 24,000 broad-gauge wagonshas now been resolved and the production programmes as as follows : Locomotives -&apos; 100 XDs have been placed in Canada for delivery ex works mostlyduring the second half of 1945.110 XDs plus 35 XEs (equal in tractive power to 48 XDs) have beenplaced in the United Kingdom and deliveries ex works have been forecast to commence and be completed within the period June to December 1945.60 XDs have been placed in the United States through F.E.A. and it isanticipated that these may be produced ex works between May and July.Wagons.8,000 have been placed in Canada for delivery in the second halfof 1945.10,000 have been placed in the United Kingdom. The rate of deliveriesis not yet known, but it is expected that the deliveries will commence inApril 1945.6,000 have been placed in the United States through F.EA. No definite information as to the rate of deliveries has yet been received, but it ispossible that production may be completed by the end of the second quarter,or early in the third quarter, of 1945.65. Lend-Lea,se. During the visit of Lord Keynes to Washington for discussions on Lend-Lease during Stage II, the question of Lend-Lease to india was considered. Excluding railway equipment the United States authoritiesagreed to supply under Lend-Lease goods to the value of over $45 million againstthe original list of requirements submitted on behalf of India totalling nearly$54 million. An additional list of items of doubtful eligibility for Lend-Leasewas submitted at the request of Lord Keynes. The United States representativesaccepted goods valued at over $11 million from this list for supply on Lend-Lease.66. The financial arrangements for the supply of railway equipment were dealt with separately. F.E.A. originally proposed that the equipment shouldbe provided on Lend-Lease terms during the war period, at the end of which india would purchase them on credit terms. This suggestion was rejected owing toits implications in regard to the building up of war debts to the United States,but it was agreed with F.E.A. that orders for the equipment should be placedforthwith, the financial arrangements to be settled by subsequent discussion. Ithas since been agreed that the Government of India should pay initially for the equipment in dollars and that the United States authorities should refund to theGovernment of India at the end of hostilities an amount agreed upon having
regard to the difference between prices paid now and the post-war world prices for similar equipment, the depreciation and obsolescence of the equipmentsupplied, and the unsuitability of their specifications for post-war use. Thepossibility is being explored of calculating in advance some part of this refundand deducting it from the Government of India&apos;s initial payment.67. In connection with acceptance of India&apos;s Lend-Lease requirements, theUnited States officials asked for an assurance that India would continue herReciprocal Aid under the existing conditions. An assurance on these lines wasgiven, subject to the proviso that India&apos;s capacity to provide supplies (on any financial terms) might be restricted on account of her economic difficulties.68. Artificial Fertilisers.-^-Increased supplies of artificial fertilisers, ofwhich India could use at least three million tons per annum, have been acceptedby the Government of India as an imperative necessity for additional foodgrainproduction. As a short-term policy they have decided to try to establish manu-facturing capacity in India within two years for an output of 350,000 tons perannum. In order to advise the Government of India on the measures necessaryto secure this end, a technical mission was appointed from the United Kingdomearly this year to make a survey in India. This mission has now reported to theGovernment of India with proposals for the establishment of a plant or plants tomake 350,000 tons per annum of sulphate of ammonia with available Indian rawmaterials. The Government of India are now considering the report, in consulta-tion with representatives of Provincial Governments, Indian States and Indianeconomists, with a view to placing contracts for a plant or plants which would befabricated partly in India and partly in the United Kingdom.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.Royal Indian Navy.69. MX. 843 was commissioned on the 25th October. H.D.M.L. 1266 wascommissioned on the 10th November.70. The Royal Indian Navy have accepted the loan of the 49th M.L. Flotillafrom His Majesty&apos;s Government and will man and maintain it.71. Royal Indian Navy ships have been actively engaged on Convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea and on the coasts of India.Military.72. Mediterranean. Indian troops have been fighting on both the 5th and8th Army fronts in Italy in severe climatic conditions.73. Burma. The capture of Kennedy Peak and Eort White by the5th Indian Division opened the way to Kalemyo and Kalewa from the West.Simultaneously the 11th East African Division advancing down the KabawValley and the Chindwin threatened them from the North. These two divisionsjoined hands at Kalemyo. The Japanese continued to put up stubborn resistance in front of Kalewa, which was a key point on their&apos; communications. In NorthernBurma Chinese troops of the Northern Combat Area Command gained a footingin Bhamo, which was completely invested by them. They also pushed 16 miles south-East of Bhamo towards the Burma-China road. The 36th (British)Division met heavy opposition North of Pinwe (110 miles S.W. of Myitkyina).From this area they were attacking at the end of the month in two directions,Southwards down the railway towards Naba and South-Eastwards through densejungle toward Katha. The latter was also being threatened by Chinese troops10 miles to the North-East.74. In Arakan the main feature of the fighting was the occupation ofPaletwa, in the Kaladan Valley, by. the 81st West African Division, which,with strong air support, dislodged the Japanese.Air.75. Strategic bombing was continued vigorously. Railway objectives inskip am, railway bridges between Pegu and Martaban on the Burma-Siam railway,the port of Mergui in South Burma and shipping in the Gulf of Martaban were successfully attacked.   Airfields and railway bridges in Central Burma were[28904] c
continually attacked, and numerous bridges in the Kalewa neighbourhood werewrecked.  Throughout the month the ground troops received unremitting, support.76. Supply by air was carried out daily, principally to troops in the NorthBurma and Chin Hills areas.77. There has been a marked recrudescence of enemy air activity bothoffensive and defensive. Various points from Myitkyina to Cox&apos;s Bazaar were attacked by small elements by night, and there were daylight fighter sweeps overthe Chin Hills front.General.78. Release Indian Army. The Government of India have approvedRelease Regulations for the Indian Army and Women&apos;s Services, India, based onthe same principle as those issued by the War Office. They apply equally to allpersonnel, British or Indian, of the Indian Army and Women&apos;s Services, India.79. Bombay Port Reconstruction. Clearance of wreckage from VictoriaDock basin was 92 per cent, completed. All hulks were ready for raising. Workon the restoration and extension of railway services at Princes and VictoriaDocks was 98 per cent, and 94 per cent, completed respectively.80. Health. Sick rates for B.O.R.S were somewhat higher than normal.Those for officers and I.O.R.S were satisfactory.81. Passive Air Defence, Proposals for a revised P.A.D. policy were beingconsidered which, if accepted, should effect a considerable saving in labour andmaterial.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Occupied Burma.82. No important changes in the state of affairs inside Japanese-occupiedBurma have been reported during November.83. With the advance of the Allied forces the Kachins, who have been consistently loyal to the British cause, have been suffering many hardships. Manyreports of Japanese brutality, including massacre, have been received. It isthought that these massacres may be in revenge for the pro-British attitude ofthe Kachins, and also in pursuance of the Japanese policy of forcing the villagersto move south with them as they retreat. The Kachins are also suffering at thehands of our Chinese allies, some of whose units are reported to be behaving verybadly, looting from the villagers and forcing them to provide labour. CertainChinese authorities in Burma have been telling the inhabitants of the frontierareas occupied by them that these territories are Chinese not British; this kindof political activity has come to notice before when Chinese troops were in Burma.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &apos;&apos; Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &apos;&apos; Colonial Governors &apos;&apos; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.Ceylon.84. Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, Civil Defence and Food Commissioner of ceylon, was in London during November for discussions on Ceylon&apos;s foodrequirements. He came to present the case for an increase in the ration of rice.Since the supplies were cut off from Japanese-occupied territories and also from india this ration has stayed at the very low level of 1 lb. per head per week.After a very full, careful and sympathetic examination of Ceylon&apos;s representa-tions by the Minister of War Transport and the Minister of Food, it has been
agreed to meet the additional import requirements of 9,000 tons of rice a monthwhich the increase of the ration for the first six months of 1945 would entail, andto do their best to maintain these additional imports during the second half ofthe year as well. I have therefore authorised the proposal to increase the riceration with effect from the 1st January.85. Sir Oliver Goonetilleke brought home a request for increases in otherimported foodstuffs, especially milk, edible fats and meat. These increases arerequired partly to maintain the nutrition of the child population, of the1 Island,which had shown signs of suffering, and ultimately to meet the gradual increased demand for meat and fats due to the large increase which has occurred in theEuropean population. The Ministry of Food have been able to agree substantially to meet the increases requested.Citrus Shipments from Palestine and Cyprus.86. The Ministry of Food have made arrangements to import 1,500,000 casesof citrus fruit from Palestine and 100,000 cases from Cyprus. The shipmentfrom Palestine will be as follows : Cases.Jaffa oranges      ............      1,000,000Grapefruit ...........,        350,000Valencia oranges ...       ...       ...       ... 150,0001,500,000Only oranges are being shipped from Cyprus. &apos;87. Prices of l$s. per case f.o.b., excluding the cost of the container, forthe Palestine fruit, and of 16s. per case f.o.b., inclusive of all costs, for the cyprus fruit, have been approved. These prices are,in excess of the figure whichthe Ministry of Food could normally pay within the maximum retail price forthe fruit to be charged in this country, but have been accepted in order to allow a reasonable return to the grower.Fiji Sugar Industry..88. Professor C. Y. Shepherd, whowisited Fiji in April last, for the purposeof investigating the relations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and theFiji cane farmers, has now submitted a report which demonstrates that the profitsearned by the Company are less than the minimum stated by the farmers to be reasonable at the time of their strike. The recommendations in the report arebriefly (1) that no specific change is necessary in fixing the price of cane, (2) thata Sugar Board should be established to advise the Governor on matters affectingthe sugar industry, (3) that a Scientific Investigation Committee should beestablished to advise on peasant farming, and (4) that land tenure regulations should be amended to prevent speculation in leases;89. These recommendations are acceptable to the Fiji Government subjectto the functions of the Sugar Board being confined to advice on the fixing of caneprices, and to certain limits on the objects of the Scientific InvestigationCommittee. It is hoped to publish the report as soon as possible when an oppor-tunity will be given&apos; for its consideration by interested parties.Visit to United Kingdom of a delegation from the Palestine Citrus JuiceProducers&apos; Associaton.90. A delegation of three from the Palestine Citrus Juice Producers7Association has recently been in this country for discussions with the Ministry ofFood and various plant manufacturers regarding the production of high-gradeorange juice for importation in connection with the Ministry of Food&apos;s welfareschemes. The technicalities of production of a type of juice of the qualityrequired have been thoroughly, discussed with the delegation and an order hasbeen placed for the equipment-necessary for the erection of a full-scale pilot plantwhich it is proposed to set up in Palestine in order to demonstrate to producersthe correct methods of production. It is hoped that this plant will be in opera-tion during the present season, and that experimental shipments of juice will bemade to this country.   The delegation has now left for a short visit to the United[28904] d
States, where it is proposed to discuss with plant and juice manufacturers recent developments in the industry which it is hoped will be of benefit to Palestine.Gold Coast Hydro-Electric Scheme.91. The British Aluminium Company, who have been working their gold coast bauxite concession on behalf of the Ministry of Aircraft Production, are anxious to continue their operations in the Colony, if this is economically possible.In the opinion of the Company the Volta River in the Gold Coast might be suitable for the development of cheap hydro-electric power for the manufactureof aluminium, and arrangements are being made for the investigation of this possibility with the aid of a grant under the Colonial Development and WelfareAct. The British Aluminium Company and the West African ElectricalDevelopment Company will co-operate with the Gold Coast Government in the investigation. The latter Company holds an exclusive licence from the Gold coast government for the supply of electricity in a. large part of the Colony and southern Ashanti. It is hoped that, if the scheme is feasible, there will be a margin of power available for the gold mines and for the development of newsecondary industries as well as for lighting purposes.British Guiana Bauxite.92. British Guiana has been the chief source of supply of bauxite for the aluminium industry in Canada. The production of bauxite in the Colony hasincreased from 476,000 tons in 1939 to 1,988,000 tons in 1943. Owing to thedecision of the Ministry of Aircraft Production to cease purchasing aluminiumfrom Canada, the Aluminium Company of Canada have decided that it will beimpossible for their subsidiary Company, the Demerara Bauxite Company, tocontinue the production of bauxite at this high rate. Already the number of employees of the Demerara Bauxite Company has been reduced from 2,700 to 700,and it will be difficult to absorb these workers in other employment until supplies are available for public works. Negotiations are now proceeding with the objectof maintaining production at 400/500,000 tons per annum.Ceylon Ports Congestion.93. The congestion at the port of Colombo which has been causing muchconcern is being investigated on the spot by Mr. Charles Hill, the expert sent outby the Ministry of War Transport.94. As a result of the congestion, it has been necessary to impose an overalllimit on loadings for arrival in Colombo during the months November to January,and the possible effects of this.limitation on the civil imports are causing me some concern.Defence.95. The 11th East African Division have fought a series of successfulactions during the past month in the Kalemyo district of the Chindwin Front in burma.96. Two further East African Brigades are being moved from Ceylon totake part in the Burma fighting.97. Lieutenant-General M. B. Burrows, C.B., has been appointed G.O.C.-in-C, West Africa, to succeeed Lieutenant-General Sir Francis P. Nosworthy,K.C.B.; and Lieutenant-General Sir Kenneth A. M. Anderson, K.C.B., has beenappointed G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa, to succeed General Sir William Platt, G.B.E.98. Colonial Governments are making progress with their plans for the eventual demobilisation of their forces and resettlement of returned men in civil life. When these plans are complete particulars will be set out in booklets issuedby the Colonial Governments to their men. Copies will be available in thiscountry.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.99. War developments have been overshadowed by the assassination ofLord Moyne. Arab opinion has alternated between relieved gratification thatJewish terrorism is operating to the detriment of Zionism and genuine concern at
the revelation of Jewish daring and fanatical reliance on force to achieve politicalaims. Jewish opinion is belatedly aroused against terrorism, but, even now,certain representative leaders have reservations. The main emphasis is upon thepossible disastrous consequences of terrorism to Zionism rather than moral andcivic duty. The Prime Minister&apos;s recent statement in Parliament, however, madea strong impression in Palestine.100. Speculation continues on all sides regarding the future of the country,the Arabs calling for implementation of the White Paper policy and the Jewsfor a Jewish State. Further expressions in high American quarters of support for Zionist aims have aroused strong feeling in Arab circles.A rab affairs.101. There has been a lull in local politics following the Alexandria Con-ference. Its practical consequences, as they may affect Palestinian Arabs areawaited by the local parties. Musa el Alami, the Palestine representative, hasreturned to Cairo for further talks. Meanwhile, the Husseini Party hasaddressed telegrams of adulation to the Governments of neighbouring arab countries and of protest to President Roosevelt. But in the matter of the forma-tion of a representative body, the Arab leaders are no nearer an agreement.Jewish affairs.102. Inter-party activity has centred round the election of the new VaadLeumi (National Council) Executive, the composition of which has been finallyfixed at five members of the Mapai (Labour Party) and one member each for theother groups, making eleven in all. .103. Partition rumours persist and are the subject of hostile references inthe Hebrew press. The recruitment campaign for the Jewish Brigade Group has developed so far on unexceptionable lines. Since the murder of Lord Moynethere has been no cause to complain of the overt attitude of the Jewish agency and the Vaad Leumi leaders.104. There were no outrages in Palestine during the month. &quot; The Fightersfor Freedom of Israel&apos;&apos; have acknowledged responsibility for the murder of LordMoyne, who is stigmatised as having been the arch-enemy of Jewish aspirations.Police measures.105. Recent police activities have included the seizure of weapons andammunition and the rounding-up and taking into custody of large numbers ofsuspected or potential terrorists. The strain on the police force has been consider-able, but their efforts have put a check to further outrages. Towards the end ofNovember Captain Rymer-Jones, Inspector-General of Police, arrived in london for urgent consultations.Zanzibar.106. Zanzibar celebrated on the 20th November the 200th anniversary ofthe dynasty of the reigning Sultan which was founded in 1744 at Muscat byAhmed bin Sa&apos;id Al-Busa&apos;id. Cordial greetings were exchanged on the occasionbetween His Majesty The King and the Sultan, and the Sultan and myself.West Africa.Resident Minister.107. Captain Harold Balfour is expected to leave the United Kingdom onthe 9th December to assume duty as Resident Minister, West Africa. He has been engaged in discussions and consultations at the Colonial Office since his appoint-ment was announced.Sierra Leone, Freetown.108. The Secretary of State has accepted in principle proposals by theGovernor for modernising the Port of Freetown as soon as war conditions permit.The principle of these proposals is to construct a deep water quay to berth three ships simultaneously. Full modern port facilities will be provided. The cost ofthe scheme is*estimated at  700,000 and it is intended to meet this expenditure by a loan under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, repayable in a periodof 25 years.
Ceylon.109. Sir Andrew Caldecott, the retiring Governor, arrived in the UnitedKingdom on the 10th November. His successor, Sir Henry Moore, left for Ceylonon the 29th November, and assumed the Government on the 4th December.The Commission on Constitutional Reform.110.   Mr. J. F. Rees, Vice-Chancellor of the University of &quot;Wales, andMr. F. J. Burrows, retiring President of the National Union of Railwaymen,have accepted invitations to serve on the Commission under the Chairmanship ofLord Soulbury;Fiji.111. Sir Philip Mitchell, the Governor, arrived in the United kingdom on the 23rd November on transfer to be Governor of Kenya.Cyprus.112. The movement towards a united front of all political parties in favourof union with Greece has made little headway. But the general politicalatmosphere remains uneasy, and an intensive campaign on the Enosis issue might,as in 1931, give rise to disorder.113. On the 12th November Athens Radio transmitted the first of a seriesof special weekly broadcasts to Cyprus. The speaker in the first broadcast wasa Cypriot British subject whose entry into Cyprus is prohibited on account ofhis Enosis activities during the 1931 disturbances and subsequently. It is clearthat the underlying purpose of these broadcasts is to encourage the Enosis move-ment in Cyprus, and representations have been made through the Foreign Officeto the Greek Government against the continuance of these broadcasts.Jamaica.   ,114. The. Instruments setting up the new Constitution receivedHis Majesty&apos;s signature on the 27th October, and were published in the Gazettein Jamaica on the 17th November. The Constitution was proclaimed at a formalceremony by the Governor on the 20th November, which was made a public holiday. Elections to the new House of Representatives take place on the14th December.115. The grant of financial assistance by His Majesty&apos;s Government toJamaica as a result of the recent severe hurricane is under consideration, and a supplementary vote will be submitted to Parliament in the near future.Bahamas.116. In my report for July I stated that the House of Assembly had rejected the Bill providing for the extension of the secret ballot to the Out Islands. Aftercorrespondence between myself and the Governor, His Royal Highness addressedthe House of Assembly on the closing of their last session expressing his regret atthe decision of the House in respect of this Bill and stating that he cannot butfeel that the House would like to have an opportunity of reconsidering thatdecision. It is proposed to introduce the measure, into the House again, earlyafter the Christmas adjournment.Aviation.Visit of Air Transport Adviser to the West Indies.117&apos;. Mr. B. C. H. Cross, my Air Transport Adviser, has returned from histour of the West Indies. He has presented reports upon airfield and other civilaviation requirements in the Colonies concerned, and his reports are underconsideration in my Department.Grant under Colonial Development and Welfare Act for Airfield Development.118.
