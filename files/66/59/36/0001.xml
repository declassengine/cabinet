(44) 73614th December, 1944. \WAR CABINET.COMMITTEE ON INDIAN FOODGRAIN REQUIREMENTS.Report.WE have considered the report of Sir Henry French (W.P. (44) 562, datedthe 10th October, 1944) on his-visit to India, and have had the benefit of an oralstatement from him in support of what he has written. We are satisfied that theimpression made on his experienced judgment must be accepted, and we accordingly adopt as our own the conclusions summarised in the final paragraphs of his report. We have satisfied ourselves that the necessary supplies will be forthcoming.2. The Minister of War Transport agrees with the other members of theCommittee as to the necessity of making a statement in the terms proposed havingregard to the economic situation in India. He has, however, informed theCommittee that large additional operational military relief and subsequentessential relief requirements for shipping are under consideration, the full satis-faction of which may not prove easy to reconcile with the proposed undertaking to India. The Committee consider, therefore, that the decision as between indian and other requirements must be taken at a higher level, but their recommendation to the War Cabinet is, subject to the Minister of War Transports reservation,that the Secretary of State for India be authorised to make to the House ofCommons a brief statement in the terms of the Annex. Our conclusions are in accord with those of the Chiefs of Staff,* that the necessity of the availability of food grains in India in 1945 should be regarded as a military requirement.3. We desire to place on record our thanks to Sir Henry French for his public spirit in making his journey to India in trying climatic conditions, and aresensible of the value to us all of his independent estimates of conditions whoseassessment has given us so much difficulty in the past.(Signed on behalf of the Committee)L.

In the future they willcontinue (after all due consultation with the Government of India) to put forward to the Combined Food organisation the reasonable requirements of India on a scale sufficient to enable them to forestall shortages and maintain control of prices.His Majesty&apos;s Government will do everything in their power to ensure that thesupplies of food grains allocated to India through that organisation will besecured and transported to Indian ports.It has already been announced that the shipment of a total of 300,000 tonshas been authorised for the period the 1st October to the 31st December. I am now glad to announce the.further decision that in the first four months of 1945shipments will continue at the rate of 70,000 tons per month, making a total of980,000 tons for the thirteen months ending on the 30th April, 1945.
