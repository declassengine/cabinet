THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENTPrinted for tJie War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (44) 716.7th December. 1944.WAR CABINET.LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME-1944-45 SESSION.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.BEFORE the war it was customary to submit to the Cabinet the legislative programme for the Session, as approved by the Home Affairs Committee. Withthe outbreak of war this practice was dropped, but in view of the nature of theProgramme for the 1944-45 Session I think that it might now be revived.2. I attach a list of the Bills submitted by Departments for-inclusion in theProgramme. The list, which has been approved by the Legislation Committee,is divided into five sections : Section 1.   Annual Bills.Section 2.   Bills which must be passed by a specified date in the1944-45 Session.Section 3.   Essential Bills connected with the prosecution of the war orarising out of the conclusion of the war with Germany.Section 4.   Reconstruction Bills.Section 5.   Other Bills.3. Before the Programme was considered by the Legislation Committee, itwas examined at a meeting of the Committee on The King&apos;s Speeches, which wasalso attended by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary, theMinister of Reconstruction and the Chief Whip; and the order in which the Billshave been arranged in the Programme is consistent with what was said in the speech on the Opening of Parliament.4. The number of Bills included in Section 4 (Reconstruction Bills) is fat-in excess of the number for which time can be found in the 1944-45 Session, and,in order .to avoid dissipating the efforts of Departments and of parliamentary counsel, the Legislation Committee agreed that among the Reconstruction Billspriority should be given to the first sixteen Bills in Section 4 (a) (including thefour Scottish Bills) and to those dealing with the national health service, thenational insurance scheme and the industrial injury insurance scheme. Workon other Bills in Sections 4 and 5 will be undertaken only in so far as this can bedone without hindering the progress of the Bills which have been given priority.The Legislation Committee will review the position at intervals of roughlysix weeks in order to make any necessary adjustments in the order of priorityassigned to Bills and to keep a general watch over the progress made.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S. W. 1,7th December, 1944.
