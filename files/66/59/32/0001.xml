THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  December 1944.Copy No.   36THE FUTURE OF THE MINISTRY OF FUEL AND POWER.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and. Power.1. In W.P. (44) 482 the Chairman of the Machinery of government committee has put before the War Cabinet the proposals of that committee regarding the future of my Department. The Committee recommend that thefunctions of the present Ministry of Fuel and Power should not again bedispersed and express the view that these functions will require a separateMinistry for a number of years after the war. Legislation will be required, andthe Committee recommend that this legislation should be prepared with a view-to its being introduced as and when appropriate.2. I feel it necessary to bring before the War Cabinet the desirability oflegislation on this subject during the present Session. The Ministers of theCrown (Emergency Appointments) Act, 1939, enables His Majesty by Order inCouncil to apply that Act (which deals with the capacity of Ministers to sit inthe House of Commons, the taking of oaths, the remuneration of officers, the seal,style and acts of Ministers and the transfer of statutory functions from Govern-ment Departments) to Ministers of the Crown &quot; appointed for the purpose of exercising functions connected with the prosecution of any war in which HisMajesty may be engaged.&quot; I was appointed Minister of Fuel and Powerdesignate on the 4th June, 1942, and by an Order in Council of the 11th June,1942, the Act was applied to the Minister of Fuel and Power and the functionsnow exercised by my Department were transferred to the Minister.3.   As the war approaches its end I am having to give increasing attentionto the post-war problems of the fuel and power industries and to the general co-ordination of fuel and power policy after the war.   The position in regard to    -each of the four main industries may be briefly summarised as follows : (i) Coal. Parliament has approved the statement in the White Paper on coal of 1942 (Cmd. 6364) that the organisation therein establishedis to continue pending a final decision by Parliament on the future ofthe industry. It seems desirable, therefore, that there should be a post-war Minister who should present the Governments plans for theorganisation of the coal industry to Parliament.(ii) Oil. Whatever the outcome of the Washington Agreement, it is fairlyclear that in the post-war period Governmental functions in relationto petroleum matters will assume greater importance than before thewar. The use of oil is closely connected with the use of other sources of energy and power and there are many ways in which oil and coalinteract. The War Cabinets Special Committee on Oil have acceptedthe view that the Minister responsible for dealing with oil problemsafter the war should be the Minister of Fuel and Power.(iii) Electricity. The Reconstruction Committee of the War Cabinet havegiven consideration to the Report of a Ministerial Committee overwdiich I presided last year on the Reorganisation of the electricity industry. The Reconstruction Committee should, I hope, be in aposition shortly to reach conclusions about the future organisation ofelectricity, both generation and distribution.. [28838]SECRET. .W.P. (44) 732.14^A December, 1944.WAR CABINET.
-(iv) Gas. I have appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship ofMr. Geoffrey Heyworth to report upon the future of the Gas Industry.I expect to receive that Report next year and hope then to be in aposition to put proposals before my colleagues. , .4. Action in regard to the post-war reorganisation of industry, taken bya Minister appointed merely for the purpose of exercising functions connectedwith the prosecution of the war, might be open to serious objection. Moreover,it appears inevitable that the future of some of the industries for which I amresponsible will be made important issues during the next Election, and, whatever the result, the Government of the day would find it convenient to have a Ministryalready possessed of sufficient post-war powers to deal with industries on lines which may have commended themselves to the Electorate.5. The Lord President of the Council in his Paper (W.P. (44) 716) on theLegislative Programme 1944-45 has provisionally included the necessary Billin the category of Essential Bills arising out of the conclusion of the war withGermany.6. I therefore submit for the approval of the War Cabinet my recommendations (i) that a Bill should be prepared at once, designed to create a peace-timeMinistry of Fuel and Power and to give the Minister the necessary powers for the exercise of his functions both during and after the war;(ii) that this Bill, which I do not think will be regarded as controversial,&apos; should be passed through both Houses of Parliament during thepresent Session.G. LI. G.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,14th December, 1944.
