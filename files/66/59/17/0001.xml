This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, December, 1944/nTOP secret.P. (44) 7178th December, 1944.The circulation of this  paper  has  been strictly   limited.    It   is   issued   for   the personal use of copy No. 3gWAR CABINETUSE OF TEAR GAS IN egypt memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARIn the joint Paper which the Secretary of State for the Colonies and I put to theWar Cabinet on 8th November, 1944, regarding the use of tear gas by the police andmilitary for the suppression of civil disorders in Palestine, we mentioned that theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, had sought approval for the use &apos;of tear gas in such circumstances both in Palestine and Egypt, as a means of dispersing mobs. Theproposal which we put to the War Cabinet, however, was confined to Palestine, sincethe Foreign Office desired to consult the Cairo Embassy as to the extension of thispolicy to Egypt, and the War Cabinet at their meeting on 13th November(W.M. (44) 149, Conclusion (4)) approved our proposal.The Foreign Office have now received Lord Killearn&apos;s views. The Ambassadorstates that certain Egyptian Police personnel are trained in the use of tear gas but may not employ it without the permission of the Egyptian Government. The EgyptianPolice somewhat doubt the efficacy of tear gas in the streets, but consider it effective for driving people from barricaded houses. Lord Killearn adds that the permission ofthe Egyptian Government would also be desirable for the use of tear gas by Britishtroops if they were collaborating with the Egyptian authorities in maintaining order,although he does not anticipate serious difficulty in obtaining such approval if andwhen the necessity arose, or even in acting without the Egyptian Governments approvalif the British authorities felt it necessary to do so. The Ambassador&apos;s view is, therefore,that the British Forces in Egypt should be prepared to use tear gas in either such case,but should not actually employ it unless the British military authorities had beeninformed by the Embassy that the Egyptian authorities had given their consent, or that there was no objection to the use of tear gas.In the event of British troops being compelled to take action to quell civil disturb-ances without the assistance of the Egyptian Police or armed forces or even in oppositionto them, Lord Killearn thinks that the use by the British of tear gas should be decided on purely military considerations. While its use would probably produce strongprotests at the time, proof of its efficacy in reducing bloodshed and quelling disturbancesspeedily would, in his view, disarm all reasonable criticism.I understand that the Foreign Office endorse Lord Killearn&apos;s views, as set out above, though they consider that the British military authorities in Egypt should in any circumstances consult the Embassy before tear gas is used.I ask the War Cabinet to take note of the views of Lord Killearn and of the ForeignOffice regarding the use of tear gas to quell civil disturbance in Egypt. I am instructingthe Commander-in-Chief accordingly, stressing the need for his consulting the Embassybefore authorizing British troops to use tear gas in Egypt.P. J. G.The War Office,8th December, 1944.(B44/188)   no   12/44   W.O.P.   202,85
