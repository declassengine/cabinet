THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 710.6th December, 1944CIVIL SUPPLIES FOR NORTH-WEST EUROPE.Note by the Minister of Production and Minister of State.THE Secretary of State for War has circulated a most interesting report onthe food situation in France, Belgium and Holland (W.P. (44) 607). As is made clear in the Secretary of State&apos;s Minute to the Prime Minister, reproduced as annex A to his paper, the military authorities have the responsibility for providing sufficient supplies for the civil population in liberated areas to preventconditions of disease or unrest from hampering military operations. The civiliandepartments have no responsibility for such civilian supplies. On the other hand,it is of great importance that the appropriate civilian departments should keepin close touch with developments as regards civilian supplies for liberated areas,even in the period of military responsibility, so that when the military authoritiesdivest themselves of all or part of their responsibilities the civil machinery is ready to take on without any interruption. In the case of France arrangements are now under consideration by the Combined Chiefs of Staff whereby the Frenchwill be able to import raw materials, &amp;c, on their own account before the end ofthe military period and while the military authorities are still importing certainbasic relief supplies. If this precedent is followed in other cases it will becomeeven more necessary for the civil departments concerned here to keep closely intouch with the military authorities on the economic and supply problems of liberated areas. We have recently reviewed the present position on the civilianside with our colleagues on the Ministerial Committee on Supply Questions in liberated and Conquered Areas, and the War Cabinet may wish to know howmatters stand.2. It is clear from the information given in W.P. (44) 607 and from allreports received subsequently that the situation of the civil population in partsof Holland is likely to be so desperate that special and drastic measures will haveto be taken by the military authorities. We are glad to know that plans are being prepared to this end. For the present, therefore, the problem in Holland is one with which the military authorities alone can deal, and the civilian departmentscan but stand ready to give any assistance for which they may be called upon bythe military authorities.3. In the case of France and Belgium, however, there are prospects that inthe near future it may prove possible to import supplies for civilian purposesadditional to those very limited categories of supplies which have hitherto beenconsidered sufficient to discharge the military responsibility to prevent disease and unrest. It has been proposed by S.H.A.E.F. that certain port capacity shouldbe made available to the French from the 1st December (in the South) and from mid-January (in the North). Similar provision for the Belgians has also been proposed. Though the Belgian and French Governments may wish to use someof this port capacity for the import of additional food supplies (particularlyvegetable oils from their Colonies), their greatest need will be for industrial rawmaterials, pit-props, transport equipment, &amp;c, to get factories and mines working and the economic life of their countries going again. In particular they will be anxious to get their textile mills into operation again, which we should wish toencourage.[28767]/Copy No./WAR CABINET.
4. The importance on political grounds of our assisting the French andBekf ian Governments to get their economies working, and thus restore their internal social stability and external purchasing power, needs no emphasis. Weconsider, however, that it would also be good business on our part to supply asmuch as possible of the materials, equipment, &amp;c, which the countries of western europe may require. This is not a question of eleemosynary relief nor of starvingourselves to feed others, but of getting these highly populated industrial countriesback to a position where they can (a) Make their contribution to the prosecution of the war.   (A start hasalready been made on this. As a result of the visit of an Anglo-American Mission, the Ministry of Supply and the General PurchasingAgent of the United States Army have started negotiations to placecontracts in France and Belgium for war supplies, in particular,textiles and tyres.)(b) Decrease the strain on the United States and the United Kingdom ofproviding manufactured goods of which they themselves are short.(c) Play their part as consumers and producers in post-war international trade and incidentally become good markets for a profitable exporttrade for this country.It must be expected that a large part of the supplies needed will have to comefrom United States since the Americans will have more free productive capacity and will be able to offer more favourable terms of payment than we can. Never-theless we have advantages in being closer at hand and in better pre-war contacts.Furthermore, the fact that much of the port capacity which will be available tothe French and Belgians in the near future will be restricted to coastal ships will influence these countries in the direction of looking to us for supplies whichthey might otherwise seek further afield. M. Monnet has already begun talks with Departments on the supplies available to meet his additional programme,and the Ministerial Committee on Supplies to Liberated and Conquered areas has directed that Departments should do their best to make supplies available!5. One factor which will considerably influence the speed with which it will prove possible to organise the despatch of. raw materials, &amp;c., to France andBelgium is the efficiency and experience of the Purchasing Missions maintained. in this country and in United States by the two countries. Under the directionof Monnet French organisations are being set up on lines generally similar to ourown missions in Washington. The Belgian Government, however, have not so farproduced such an organisation, and the need for an improvement in this respecthas now been brought to the notice of the Belgian Government. We are considering whether our own representation in Brussels should be strengthenedon the economic side so that more assistance and advice can be given when needed.6. It will be clear to our colleagues that U.N.R.R.A. neither has nor seems likely to have any responsibility for dealing with supplies to France, Belgium and holland. The Governments of these countries are in a position to pay for and administer their own imports and their responsibility begins where militaryresponsibility ceases. The countries requiring U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s assistance are not in north-West Europe Greece is a typical example and are therefore outside thescope of this Paper; but its conclusions apply with equal force to their case also.7. So long as supplies for the civil population are delivered by the militaryauthorities, they are of course shipped as part of a military shipping programme.As soon as the Allied Governments begin to import supplies on their own account,however, it will be necessary to have separate allocations of shipping for their civilimport programmes, similar to those at present maintained for the Middle East,North Africa and the Dominions. We understand that the Minister of War Trans-port has this matter under consideration In the first instance it will not be easy toarrive at a reasonable figure for the import programme of a country like France;while her needs will be enormous and urgent, some allowance will have to be madefor the fact that not all she wants will be available at once and that even if itwere it could probably not be distributed internally under existing conditions.For the purposes of initial planning of shipping, therefore, it will be necessaryto make a rough guess and to refine this later in the light of experience.8. It is clear that the opening of port capacity sufficient to allow non-military imports will lead to great pressure from the Allies upon the Anglo-American shipping authorities to provide shipping. While the shipping position will limit the extent to which we shall be able to meet these demands, it will, in
our view, be necessary to satisfy them to some degree. &quot;The extent to which shipping can be provided for such programmes before the end of the German warwill, however, call for decision at the highest level, since there is already a deficit of shipping against existing programmes.9. The most important requirement of all liberated countries is for meansof transport. In all cases the retreating enemy have left behind virtually nomotor trucks capable of operation and very few locomotives and railway wagons.In France, for instance, M. Rene Mayer, the Minister of Transport and PublicWorks, says that out of a pre-war total of some 9,000 locomotives only halfremain, and of these a large proportion cannot be worked without repairs, and out of 430,000 wagons only 200,000 remain. Very few lorries indeed are in commission, since of those physically available nearly all lack tyres or batteries.Of these the United Kingdom clearly cannot supply new motor trucks nor loco-motives. It is possible, however, that before long we might be able to devote somecapacity freed from munitions production to the production of additional wagons.We can hardly expect to do so immediately because important requirements forIndia are outstanding, but the Minister of Labour has agreed to assist in an examination of the possibilities.10. The Minister of Labour has expressed the view, in which the S.L.A.Committee have concurred, that wherever possible orders placed in the nearfuture for equipment needed to restore European production and transport should be regarded in the United Kingdom as war orders. Such orders willfor the most part follow on after munitions orders and there is a danger thatthe factories may regard them as a return to peace-time conditions unless theycan be handled as war requirements. As speed of delivery will be one of the main considerations from the point of view of the purchasing Governments, it is.important that such orders should be carried out as rapidly as possible,consistently with their not interfering with production for military purposes.The exact arrangements by which this can best be done will require working out.We realise that it is important not to extend this kind of treatment over too widea field and that other demands, such as those for the temporary housing programme, have already been given the status of war production. Each newdemand will therefore have to be carefully scrutinised. But we think that themore important orders for equipment needed to restore production and transport in Europe have strong claims to special treatment.11. We ask our colleagues to take note of the information given in this paper and to give their approval to the principle, suggested in paragraph 10 above,of treating the more important equipment orders for the restoration of Europeanproduction and transport capacity as war orders, subject to the scrutiny referredto at the end of the paragraph.O. L.R. K. L.6th December, 1944.
