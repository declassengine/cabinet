E. BRIDGES,Secretary.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,15th December, 1944.ANNEX.Copy of a Letter dated l&amp;th December, 1944, from His Majesty King George ii of Greece to the Prime Minister.(Private.) Claridge&apos;s Hotel, London, W. 1,My dear Prime Minister, 14 A December, 1944.I feel I must convey to you the deep sorrow produced in me by yesterday&apos;discussions. After a common effort of so many years, during which I did notspare myself or my people, I never expected that the time would ever come when I should hear what I heard yesterday.I have pondered with all possible detachment on the arguments you advanced in support of the immediate establishment of a Regency, and I have studied anewMr. Macmillan&apos;s views, to-which you seemed to subscribe.What you demand of me really amounts to this : that I should entrust the regency to the Archbishop, with all the consequences implicit in such an action,without my being told what precisely are the obligations the rebels would under-take against this concession. You have not assured me that the disarming ofthe guerillas would necessarily follow, or that General Scobie&apos;s terms would beaccepted, nor even do you inform me of the terms of the agreement now being sought with the rebels. What would be the position if, after the announcementof the Regency, the guerillas were to persist in their refusal to disarm or wereto put forward new terms % And what would be my own responsibility if I were now to surrender my authority to a Regent who would be able to take decisions in my name, without my being sure that the large but unarmed majority of my people would not be handed over to-morrow to the tender mercies of an armedminority ?I do not know whose views Mr. Macmillan is referring to when he says thatthe demand for the Archbishop &apos;s appointment as Regent constitutes &quot; a generalhope and wish of the people.&quot; What I can tell you, from my own information and on the strength of ten years&apos; experience at the head of my people, is thatsuch a course of action would be regarded as an abandonment of the struggle,would bring confusion to the front of resistance to the extreme left, would disgustthe Royalists and the Conservatives, and would immediately give birth toinnumerable intrigues around the person of the Archbishop, who does not by any means enjoy the general confidence of the political world. We have had manysimilar disappointments in the past over the choice of persons.Yet you expect me to take such a momentous decision simply on the strengthof Mr. Macmillan&apos;s recommendations, without even my Government being consulted indeed, against the views of my own Prime Minister and many other[28836]SECRET.    .W.P. (M) 741.15th December, 1944.
political leaders. In considering such a grave matter concerning the future ofthe Crown and bound also with a vital political problem on the settlement ofwhich will depend the future of my country, I think it would constitute noexcessive caution on my part if I wished to ascertain the views of all therepresentatives of the political parties, who should first be made cognisant of allthe advantages that would accrue to the people from such a sacrifice on the partof their King.From my attitude so far you have no reason to believe that I have everthought of my own self when it came to a question of serving my country. Youwill no doubt have in mind ail the declarations by which I specifically andirrevocably undertook to submit myself to the will of my people. I left thegovernment entirely in the hands of persons known for their anti-dynasticsentiments, without once pressing for the appointment of any Minister faithfulto the Crown. I agreed not to proceed to Greece without the previous consent ofmy Government, and I accepted without demur your own counsel not to raise this issue at a time when the liberation was being joyfully celebrated throughoutGreece. Surely you are in a position to know whether there was ever in myheart the disposition to insist on anything that concerned my person. I am ready for any sacrifice; but this sacrifice must be for my peopled benefit and at my people&apos;s demand. I have never solicited anyone&apos;s help to safeguard my Throne,and you know you more than anybody else, my clear Prime Minister howwronged I am by those who think I would wish to rely on anything other than the will of my people. But is it a &quot; self-defence policy &quot; that I should wish to retainintact all my rights and duties towards my people until such time as they canfreely express their will ?What hurt me most of all during all these discussions was your remarksabout the sacrifices the British troops are undergoing in Greece to-day to imposeorder. I can assure you that a feeling of horror goes through me when I think ofthis unbelievable tragedy. What purpose would it serve now to examine how this has come about, and how so many arms are found in the hands of people who, -after using them to seize power, have no compunction now in turning themagainst Greece&apos;s best friend? What I would like to say to you once again, aftermature reflection during the night, is that in my desire to help the position ofyour Government and yourself, to whose assistance Greece owes so much. I wouldnot ask your troops to remain in Greece one minute longer than is absolutely necessary for the liberation of the capital and its environs and for the armingof the population so that it can defend itself. Beyond this, it is purely a matter for the occupation authorities, and will depend exclusively on the general policywhich your Government intends to follow with regard to countries liberatedby British arms. But until the arming of the Government forces is effected andthe safety of the people is ensured, I cannot believe that there is any man in thiscountry who would be willing to abandon the Greek Government and that partof the population loyal to it to the mercy of armed bands equipped by the british authorities. Because, quite apart from all considerations of fair play in a situation where British initiative is so deeply committed, quite apart also fromthe most elementary sense of humanity towards an unarmed mass of human beings,the Government which you recognise to-day is your ally : it was formed at yourrecommendation; and it derives its legal status from me, who did not grudgeyou any sacrifice when my contribution to the Allied cause was still of someweight. I did not stop to consider that Greek soldiers would die by the side ofyour own men in Macedonia and Crete in a military enterprise doomed in advance,nor that Greece would have to suffer the tragedy of occupation. And when, afterthe German attack, the political leaders faltered and none came forward toassume responsibility, I took that responsibility on my own shoulders, acting as my own Prime Minister for some time.This country, where you have so hospitably given me shelter and whichI have come to love as my own native land, cannot forget these things quickly,and I feel sure that, if it were to see my Government being abandoned to its fate,a shock would go through it much stronger than that produced by the presentanxiety over the fact that British troops are implicated in Greece. More thanthat, the whole of Europe would soon appreciate the full significance of sucha failure.With my most cordial feelings,Yours very sincerely,GEORGE II R.
