THIS DOCUMENT.IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.Copy No.    O 0WAR CABINET.PREFABRICATED (PERMANENT) TIMBER HOUSES FROM SWEDEN.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.1. I desire to support the proposal put forward by the Minister of Recon-struction in W.P. (44) 733.2. My information is that Svenska Trahus (an Association of manufacturers of prefabricated houses, representing about 75 per cent, of total Swedish capacity)can produce between 25,000 and 30,000 four-roomed houses within twelve months.In addition there are certain independent firms which, for various reasons, canadd to the total. It is therefore by no means inconceivable that we might obtaineven more than 30,000 houses from Sweden if we wish to do so.3. It is most desirable to have an early decision on this matter. We arenow engaged in negotiations for a new Agreement with the Swedish Governmentdesigned to regulate Swedish imports and exports during the remainder of theGerman war and the immediate post-hostilities period. The Swedes are most anxious to achieve a considerable volume of trade with the United Kingdom and quite realise that for at least a year after sea communications are reopenedtheir exports to this country will considerably exceed what they can obtain from us. They are, however, most anxious-to discover what our requirements arelikely to be and it will be difficult to reach a final agreement on this aspect ofour negotiations until we can give them some reply. It would therefore be very useful to know, as soon as possible, whether prefabricated houses are to be includedin the list.4. Another reason for an early decision is that according to my information the Norwegian, Polish, Dutch and Belgian Governments in addition toU.N.R.R.A. are all showing an interest in Swedish prefabricated houses. Ifwe do not move soon we may find that the number available to us is substantiallydiminished.5. An order of the size envisaged by the Minister of Reconstruction would,I think, be welcomed by the Swedish Government. During the last year Swedenhas gone a, very long way to meet our economic warfare demands. Trade withthe enemy has already been reduced to tiny proportions and, except for certainsmall unobjectionable exports to Norway and Denmark, which are approved inadvance by the British and American authorities, will cease altogether from the1st January, 1945, until the end of the war. This means that practically allSwedish external trade will be at an end, and for the first time in several years, theSwedish authorities are confronted with a threat of unemployment. While Ido not suggest that our policy should be, or is ever likely to be, determined by considerations of gratitude, the fact remains that the Swedes have gone much further to meet our wishes and have demonstrated more practical sympathy forthe Allied cause than any other neutral. On these grounds also, I should welcome the course proposed by the Minister of Reconstruction.6. Apart from considerations germane to Economic Warfare, I shouldfrom practical experience like to endorse the view of the Minister of Reconstruc-tion that shortage of rural cottages is now one of the greatest bottlenecks thatimpede an increase in agricultural production.S.Minister of Economic Warfare, W. 1,19th December, 1944.SECRET.W.P. (45) 749.19th December, 1944.[28860]
