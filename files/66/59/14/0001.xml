Furious[28777]On the 22nd, 24th and 29th August further strikeswere made against the Admiral von Tirpitz during thecourse of which at least four hits were secured with1,000 or 500-lb. bombs. During these attacks other air-craft ranged the locality and engaged various subsidiarytargets. Fighters shot down two shadowing aircraft and destroyed or damaged nine other aircraft on theground. A hangar at Banak, radar stations on Leroyand Ingoy, and several surface craft, were also heavily attacked.Our losses amounted to nine aircraft (1 Barracuda,2 Hellcats, 4 Corsairs, 1 Seafire and 1 Firefly).On the 3rd August thick fog frustrated an intendedstrike on enemy shipping passing through the Norwegianleads, but fighter aircraft were able to operate. Theirsweep was relatively uneventful, but two radar stations were shot up with good effect.On the 11th August fighters from this carrier coveredAvengers operating from H.M.S. Nabob and H.M.S.Trumpeter, then employed in mining the Harhms andLepsorev channels. These fighters successfullyneutralised the nearby airfield at Gossen, where theydestroyed 6 Me. 110s on the ground, damaged a seventh,and left two hangars and some storehouses burning.The minelaying operation was completely successful,but one Avenger failed to return.In the Lepsoy area other targets, which included threeradar and two W/T stations, gun positions, an oil tank,a dredger, a barge and two flak ships, were all heavilyengaged; the oil tank and the dredger being left on fire.One Firefly failed to return.sea fires from this carrier covered Avengers from.M.S. Trumpeter when on the 12th September theyagain mined Norwegian waters.A well-escorted ship of some 4,500-tons burdenfortuitously entered the mined area as this operation was in progress, and our fighters heavily damaged thisb

Class mine-sweepers, and seriously damaged the other three escorts.One Seafire .was shot down and five other aircraftreturned damaged.Joined Home Fleet mid-October and on the 18th/19thher Fireflies carried out an armed reconnaissance for major enemy Naval Units in the Tromso are. the admiral von Tlrpitz was photographed near Haakoyand Bardufoss airfield and Sorreisen were attacked by, Fireflies. One He. 115 was destroyed on the water andtwo others damaged.H.M.S. Implacable was again in Norwegian waters onthe 26th, 27th and 28th October, when her Fireflies,Barracudas and sea fires struck at shipping betweenBodo and Rorvik and at Lodingen. A tank landing craft, a merchant ship of 5,000 tons, a small tanker, an aircraft tender and a minesweeper were sunk while aU-boat, a flak ship and a trawler were driven ashore.Fifteen other ships were damaged, including fivemerchant ships of about 5,000 tons and among the shoretargets strafed were Ramsund U-Boat Depot, Eggumradar station and an oil tank and flak positions atSandnessjoen.Five aircraft were lost.Sailed to join Eastern Fleet on the 15th September,docking at Gibraltar en route. She is being detainedthere by serious engine trouble.Paid off on the 15th September, having been continuously in service for the past 27 years.Three major carrier-borne operations have been successfully carried out against Japanese positions inthe Indian Ocean.(i) During the early hours of the 24th August targets at Padang and at the port of Emmahaven were attacked.Complete surprise was achieved and only moderateanti-aircraft defences were encountered. Twenty Barra-cudas, escorted by twenty Corsairs, dropped 58 x 500-lb.M.C. bombs on the Indraroeng cement works, while asecond strike of twelve Barracudas and twelve Corsairsattacked Emmahaven. In the first attack all bombs fellin the target area and in the second, two motor-vessels of400 ft. and 280 ft. respectively, the railway line,various buildings and wharves, were all hit by 500-lb.bombs and a destroyer or sub-chaser was straddled.Two Corsairs and one Barracuda failed to return.(ii) A very similar attack to the above was made onthe 18th September when the railway repair and main-tenance centre at Segli on the N.E. coast of Sumatrawas heavily bombed with telling effect.From this operation our forces retired without loss.(iii) The most recent of these operations was made against enemy bases in the Nicobar Islands on the17th October.The airfield and its A.A. gun emplacements on CarNicobar were heavily and effectively strafed, while other aircraft raided the harbour of Nancowry where onemedium sized and five small ships were sunk, harbourinstallations were damaged and go-downs left on fire.All enemy air opposition was summarily dealt withby our fighters and at least eight enemy aircraft were shot down.None of our ships sustained any damage, but four ofour aircraft (3 fighters and 1 bomber) failed to return.Arrived Durban on the 9th August, and after exten-sive refit has now returned to Colombo.
2. Escort Carriers.(i) While, as previously detailed, some Escort Carriers were operating in company with the Fleet Carriers in Northern waters, four others, H.M. ShipsStriker, Campania, Vindex and Fencer, were also employed on other duties inthese same waters.(ii) H.M.S. Striker and H.M.S. Vindex sailed on the 16th September withconvoy JW. 59, and on the outward passage our aircraft made 23 U-boat sightings.As a result of 14 attacks at least one and probably two U-boats were sunk. Onthe homeward voyage (R.A. 59) 1 U-boat attacked by H.M.S. Vindexes Swordfishwas later sunk by surface forces.(iii) The next Russian convoy, JW. 60, left Scapa on the 16th September with .M. Ships Striker and Campania in support and reached the Kola Inlet without incident. . On the return passage enemy submarines were in contact with the convoy on the 29th/30th September and our aircraft made three sightings andone attack.(iv) On the 22nd October a third convoy-JW. 61 which sailed Northescorted by ELM. Ships Nairana, Vindex and Tracker has now reached itsdestination without incident.(v) H.M.S. Nabob and H.M.S. Trumpeter both sailed in company with thethree Fleet carriers whose duty it was to attack the Admiral von Tirpitz in thethird week of August, but on the 22nd August and when still in visual contact with our main forces H.M.S. Nabob was torpedoed by a U-boat.In consequence, H.M.S. Trumpeter abandoned her projected mine-laying operations and covered H.M.S. Nabob&apos;s withdrawal. By fine seamanship thedamaged escort carrier was safely brought Home under her own steam, and on passage successfully catapulted and landed on anti-submarine patrols althoughdangerously down by the stern and very tender on the helm.  No aircraft were lost.(vi) H.M. Ships Trumpeter and Fencer sailed from Scapa on the28th September and for three days established and maintained, in exceedingly bad weather, vitally needed anti-U-boat patrols in the North Sea.(vii) On the 14th/15th October H.M.S. Trumpeter and H.M.S. Fencercontinued mining operations in Norwegian waters and in all 22 mines were laidas planned and shipping encountered was attacked with bombs.A medium-sized merchant ship and her two escorts were damaged and flakpositions shot up.No enemy air opposition was experienced and our forces retired without loss.H.M.S. Trumpeter took part in yet another successful mine-laying operation in Norwegian waters on the 24th October, this time accompanied by H.M.S.Campania. An intended shipping strike was abandoned through bad weather.One fighter was lost.(viii) Seven assault carriers, H.M. Ships Hunter, Stalker, A ttacker, Khedive,Pursuer, Searcher and Emperor, with a total complement of 166 fighter aircraft and supported by two United States carriers with 48 aircraft, covered landingoperations in the South of France from -the 15th to the 23rd August.Their manifold activities eventually ensured the complete success of the landing.Aircraft losses were light, less than 10 per cent, of our aircraft being lost by enemy action, while none of the nine carriers sustained damage.When finally released from this commitment on the 28th August the sevenBritish carriers were immediately sailed for Alexandria where they joinedForce 120.Four of the ships, H.M. Ships Hunter, Attack-er, Stalker and Emperor, werequickly re-employed in offensive operations connected with the liberation of greece and the -aegean Islands, while H.M.S. Searcher covered subsidiary R.A.F. and naval operations in areas W. of Crete in mid-September.As operations progressed in Greek waters the three carriers, H.M.S. Pursuer,Searcher and Khedive, left Alexandria on the 1st October and sailed for theUnited Kingdom to refit for future duty with the Eastern Fleet.Many attacks have been made on shipping, airfields and lines of communica-tion, which have harassed and materially hastened the departure of theWehrmacht from Southern Greece.Such operations continue.(ix) Five escort carriers, H.M. Ships Battler, Begum, Shah, Atheling andAmeer, are still with the Eastern Fleet, and have been variously employed on escort, ferrying and A/S duties.[28777] , b 2
On the 10th and 12th August H.M.S. Begum and H.M.S. Shah, when withForce 66, sighted, attacked and damaged an enemy submarine which had beenintensively hunted for several days by other forces.  This U-boat was later sunk.(x) Other escort carriers have been used in ferrying aircraft from the UnitedStates to the British Isles, South Africa and the Eastern Theatre.(xi) H.M.S. Argus continued in service as a deck-landing training carrieruntil mid-September, when she was relieved by H.M.S. Speaker. H.M.S. Ravagerwas also employed on similar duties during the whole of this period. Betweenthem these carriers have qualified 290 pupils and given refresher courses to17 others, in addition to training deck-handling parties.(xii) H.M.S. Pretoria Castle continues in service as trials carrier.3. M.A.C. Ships.Four of these nineteen ships have now reverted to a solely commercial status and two still remain under the Dutch flag.All these vessels have satisfactorily carried out their arduous butunspectacular duties, and by the end of September had completed no fewer than100 round voyages without loss.Section II. Detached Naval Squadrons Operating from Shore Bases.4. Two of the eight squadrons which were operating with Coastal Commandat the start of this period have been withdrawn for service afloat. The others havebeen actively employed mainly on day and night anti-shipping patrols and claimseveral successes against small coastal craft and E-boats. In addition they made smoke-laying sorties for the protection of Channel convoys.One squadron stood by to move to St. Denys in Belgium, but it was eventuallynot required.During August the first operational use was made of the A.S.V. Mark XIbombing aid which facilitates &quot; blind bombing,&quot; and results are consideredsatisfactory.Section III. Aircraft and Equipment.5. British Aircraft.(i) The first re-equipment of a squadron with Seafire XV will probablytake place in February-March 1945, and the second as soon after as productionand reserves allow.(ii) The Seafire XVII (i.e., the Seafire XV fitted with Sting type arrestorhook and rear view fuselage allowing a better view aft) will be coming off theproduction line in small numbers in December.(iii) The first De Havilland Hornet fitted with arrestor hook, but notmodified for wing folding, is expected to be flying in the early spring of 1945.The top speed of the Hornet at 22,000 feet is in the region of 480 m.p.h.(iv) It may now be possible to modify the Firefly for two point acceleration.A trial installation is being carried out.The Firefly has been cleared for the carriage of two 500 lb. bombs, and theMinistry of Aircraft Production consider that it should eventually be capable ofcarrying two 1,000 lb. bombs.The carriage of RPs. is under active consideration, but the jettisoning of the installation has yet to be cleared. This is essential to enable the aircraft to operate with maximum efficiency, but clearance for the R.P. installation (nonjettisonable) has been given and the first, squadron equipped.(v) The Firefly III, with two stage Griffin 61 engine will be in production by October, 1945.   This aircraft is about 30 kts. faster than the Firefly I.(vi) The Westland long range Naval Fighter, which is the first aircraft ofthis description to be specially designed and built as such, should be flying inprototype form in a year&apos;s time. If this is successful it is hoped it may alsoprove a satisfactory long range torpedo-bomber strike aircraft.6. American Aircraft.(i) The Corsair and Hellcat are continuing to prove excellent aircraft, andthe later Marks, Corsair IV and Hellcat II, fitted with water injection, have anincreased speed of some 20 m.p.h.
(ii) During this quarter the first naval Photographic reconnaissance squadron was formed and has been despatched to the Eastern Theatre inH.M.S. Rajah. The Squadron consists of 6 Hellcat aircraft, modified in america to carry one K. 18 and one K. 17 vertical camera with 24-inch and 6-inch lensesrespectively.In addition the squadron has one Hellcat aircraft modified in the UnitedKingdom to carry 2 F. 24-20-inch lens, and 1 K. 17-6-inch vertical and 1 F. 24oblique.Results and comparisions between the British and American installationsunder operational conditions are awaited with interest.r; nAPPENDIX I.Wastage May-July 1944.Losses of Naval Aircraft incurred during period May, June, July 1944.   reports received up to and including 31st October, 1944.Type.
