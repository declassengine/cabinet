THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET. Copy No3W.P. (44) 745.18th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.PARTICIPATION OF FRANCE IN THE SURRENDER, occupation and CONTROL OF GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. .AT a recent meeting of the European Advisory Commission, the french representative, M. Massigli, took occasion to say (i) that he had now been ableto examine the text of the Instrument of Surrender of Germa,ny recommended bythe Commission to the three Governments and approved by them, and was happy to say that the French Delegation were in accord with its principles, though they would have amendments to put forward on points of detail; (ii) that hewould shortly circulate a memorandum to the Commission asking for the alloca-tion to France of a zone of occupation in Germany; and (iii) that he would atthe same time ask for the participation of France in the Allied control machinery in Germany.2. We had always expected that the French Government would put forwardthese requests, upon admission to the European Advisory Commission.3. As regards the Instrument of Surrender, the French Government will no doubt wish it to be signed by a representative of the French High Commandas well as by representatives of the British, American and Soviet High Commands.This would be a reasonable request which it would be difficult to resist.4. As regards occupation, the Prime Minister and I, during our recent visit to Paris, informed General de Gaulle and M. Bidault that we were infavour of the allocation to France of a separate zone in Germany, though wecould not of course speak for our Allies on this point. From such indicationsas we possess, the French do not appear to wish for more than quite a smallzone in Western Germany, at the present stage at any rate.5. As regards machinery of control, we must expect the French to askfor participation on something like equal terms with ourselves, the americans and the Russians. A quadripartite machine would of course be more difficultto work than a tripartite one, and the admission of France would thus set anumber of practical problems. But the participation of France in the controlmachinery would be a necessary consequence of the allocation to France of aseparate zone of occupation. In any event France&apos;s admission to the european advisory Commission, her recently concluded alliance with the Soviet Union, ourown declared policy in favour of her restoration to the status of a first-classPower, and our desire that she should play a large part in the solution of theGerman problem, would all point to the necessity of her taking her due placein the control machinery in Berlin.6. We cannot of course come to a final decision on any of these questionsuntil France&apos;s claims have been stated by the French Delegation to the european advisory Commission and discussed by the Commission. But in view of the considerations advanced above, and also in order to prevent our being fore-stalled by the Russians, I have authorised the United Kingdom representative on the European Advisory Commission to inform his colleagues, as soon as theFrench Representative puts forward his views, that the United Kingdom Dele-gation agree in principle that a Representative of France should sign the instrument of Surrender, that France should have a separate zone of occupation in Germany, and that France should participate in the machinery of control.A. E.Foreign Office, 18th December, 1944.12607   [28850]
