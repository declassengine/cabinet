L.Ministry of Production,Great George Street, S.W. 1,1st December, 1944.ANNEX.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S.A.The Transition from War to Peace.Public discussion of reconversion and of the immediate post-war periodhas tended to foster a dangerously unbalanced view of the problems and difficulties ahead. Three points are constantly recurring : First, there is thestress on the need for &quot; full employment,&quot; with particular reference to jobs forreturning service men and for those released from munitions work. Secondly,great emphasis is now laid by War Production Board, War Man-PowerCommission and other agencies on the sweeping relaxation of controls and on the ability of unfettered industry to do the job of reconversion and to turn out vastquantities of consumers goods. Finally, much is made of the pent-up demand of consumers and of the unparalleled accumulation of savings in &quot; liquid &quot; formready to be poured out in a spate of spending. In short, attention is beingfocussed on continued high output and incomes with consumer purchasing power(including savings) at an unprecedented level. This points in only one direction- -to the risk of inflation.Economic experts, inside and outside the Administration, do not subscribe tothis popular expression of the problem. They have been pointing out for some time that the underlying economic situation in the United States is peculiarly difficultto interpret and that deflation in the transition period is just as big a risk asinflation some would say a bigger risk. Two quotations will illustrate the line taken. In the leading article in the Federal Reserve Bulletin for October, an analysis of war-time savings concludes that war-time developments have introduced a monetary element, the behaviour of which is even less foreseeable than usual, so that the post-war economypossesses potentialities both of great inflation and at the same time of con-siderable contraction.&quot;[28737] &apos; copy No.
Chester Bowles, Office of Price Administration Administrator, is equallyconscious of the uncertainty. In a well-balanced memorandum to Office of PriceAdministration officials on pricing policy in the reconversion period, he says : &quot;During the war our efforts have aimed solely at checking inflation.On V-E Day the picture will change. When the telegrams go out cancellingwar orders, the forces of deflation will begin to develop.&quot; From that day on until full production is achieved and supply and demands come into reasonable balance, the forces of inflation and deflationwill exist in our economy side by side. But now it is impossible for anyoneto say with finality which will be the greater.&quot;This niakes the task of Office of Price Administration particularly difficult: &quot; A weak price policy during the next few months can set in motion allthe powerful inflationary forces that surround us. A rigid price policyin which no allowance is made for legitimate increases in costs could stifleemployment and production and head us straight for a major depression.&quot;It is unfortunate that a dispassionate and careful analysis of the situationlooks too much like fence-sitting to hit the headlines and to have much popularappeal at this election time.The following sections include an analysis of some of the official materialon the present position of the United States economy and throw light on the magnitude of the problems of transition. We may pull together the differentthreads as follows : Let us look first at the much over-played concept of full employment. the record volume of goods and services now being turned out in the United states is the result of full employment in a very wide sense. The labour force nowincludes practically everyone who wants a job and many who are at work only for patriotic and other temporary reasons. Hours of work have been increasedeverywhere and are over-long in many occupations. There is a great concentra-tion of employment in high productivity- industries, particularly in metal-working, at the expense of the less productive &apos;&apos; service &apos;&apos; trades. But this isno goal for peace-time. Full employment after the war really means somethingquite different, namely, jobs for those who want them, but only of the typeswanted and combined with ample leisure, more education and early retirement.Young people will go back to college, housewives back to their homes, and oldmen back to their pipes and rocking-chairs. Many of those who remain at workv/ill be found operating gas stations or selling refrigerators on easy terms ratherthan working long and tiring hours at a drilling machine or in a foundry. Thiswould be denied by no one but few go on to an appreciation of the consequenteffect on total output and income. There is a tendency to -assume that thepresent output and income, associated with full employment in the war-time sense,will continue with full employment in the peace-time context. Actually thequestion is not whether income will be maintained but rather how muchreduction should be anticipated.A conservative estimate, based on calculations indicated below, is that pay-rolls in manufacturing industries will decline by one-third in the transition period, a loss of around $10 billions per year. There should be some compensation from increased activity in non-manufacturing trades, but this offset will belimited by the general reduction in hours of work and by the lower per head inthe trades which will expand. It is difficult to put the overall reduction in thetotal United States wage bill at less than $5 billions per year and it may be$10 billions or more. There will, of course, be parallel and consequent reductions in the incomes of other sections of the population.This brings us to the risk of deflation and depression, rather than inflation and boom, during the transition period. We have said that incomes will bereduced as the result of the shift from wartime to peacetime types of employment.Additional reductions must be expected since it is inconceivable that reconversionwill be a perfectly managed job, accomplished without some delay, without somemisdirection of resources and without some unemployment of labour and facilities. The reduction and (even more important) the uncertainty of incomeswill have a deflationary effect.There are, however, some factors to which we can look to counteract adeflationary tendency. One is liberal unemployment compensation (together withveterans&apos; benefits) and the spending of accumulated, savings is another.   Political
(0 2rather than economic considerations are likely to govern the amount and thenature of benefits to unemployed war workers. The analysis given below indicates that accumulated savings may be a broken reed upon which to rely. There is nothing surprising in the fact that war savings are largely held in the &quot; liquid &quot;form of cash, bank deposits and war bonds. There is little else that can bedone since direct investment in the form of capital goods is almost impossibleunder wartime controls. But it is faulty logic to conclude that, because savingsare in forms which could be spent quickly, they will in fact be spent quickly.. Apart from the disappearance of such durable goods as automobiles,refrigerators and radios, consumers expenditures have been continued on a very high level. Moreover, it is known that consumers were overstocked with somedurable goods (e.g., radios) by the end of 1941. Certainly, consumers are not likely to take anything thrown on to the market during the transition periodif they think better articles will be available later. Some goods which will bein public demand may not be produced in any quantity for a considerable time,e.g., for the lack of components such as fractional horse-power motors. Finally,the savings habit of consumers may easily have been strengthened as a - resultof war experience and may be sustained by continued bond drives after V-E Day.Savings were generally regarded as too high for a balanced and fully deployedeconomy before the war and there is really no valid reason for expecting anything else in the transition period.Altogether, these and other considerations give us reason to doubt whether there will be much spending of accumulated savings in the transition period;indeed, individuals may -even reduce the proportion they spend out of their current incomes. It would be the height of folly to rely solely upon a buyingsplurge to bolster up the economy once deflationary forces are at work.United States National Income.The Department of Commerce has recently carried forward its regularestimates of the United States national income and product and figures for thefirst half of 1944, together with much related material on the United Stateseconomy, are shown in the September issue of&apos; the Survey of Current Business.Prices, output and income have been rising very slowly for some months and it appears probable that the war-time peak has now been reached. In thefirst half of this year gross output was at a rate a little below $200 billionsper year with personal incomes at $155 billions per year before taxes and$130 billions per year after taxes. In 1939, at the prices then ruling, grossproduct was less than $90 billions and personal incomes only $70 billions.National output and income are now well over double the 1939 level in money terms, whereas prices have risen only 38 per cent, at wholesale and rather lessat retail. The official cost of living index shows a rise of 27 per cent, from mid 1939 to mid 1944 but unofficial calculations indicate that retail prices ofthe types of commodities bought by working class families have risen by30-50 per cent, if account is taken of quality deterioration.The upward movement in the general level of prices practically ceased ayear ago.   The official index numbers are- United States Price Index Numbers.(Bureau of Labor Statistics.)JulyWholesale Prices (1926 = 100)Combined index Farm productsFoodsOther commoditiesCost of Living (1935-39 = 100)Combined index Food     .......ClothingHouse furnishingsOther items     ...[28737]1939756367i809994100101101-J1941898685901051071051071041943103125107971241391291261121944104 &apos;12410698i1261371381381151b 2
There are, however, several important prices which have risen more than theaverage and which are still moving upward. Lumber prices, for example, arenow more than 70 per cent, above those ruling in the middle of 1939, while retail prices of clothing and house furnishings are approaching a level 40 per cent,above the average for 1935-39. Even here, despite prospective continued tightnessof supplies of lumber and textiles, the buoyancy of prices is less than it was some months ago.The moderate rise in the total output of the United States (Gross national product) since the beginning of 1943 has been about equally divided betweenincreased war output and higher consumption : United States Gross National Product,(Department of Commerce.)Consumers expenditures ...Private capital items*   ...Government non-war expendituresGovernment war expenditures ...billions at current prices (annual rates).1941.74-619 013-212-81943.1943.1st Half. 2nd Half.89-81-711-679-39202-612-683-31944.1st Half.95-52-012-886-1Total Gross National Product   88-6     119-6     182-4     190-5     196- it cannot be stressed too often that the war effort of the United States hasbeen sustained primarily and predominantly by increased total output. Enforcedreductions in private capital expenditures, including the decline in inventories,have been drastic but with a relatively minor effect on the total picture. In theUnited States, unlike Britain, it has not been necessary to draw upon theremaining source from which the war effort can be sustained by reductions in personal consumption. In fact, the remarkable growth in total output in theUnited States, together with the smaller contribution from reduced capitalspending, has been more than enough to cover all the war expenditure of theFederal Government and has left a little to spare to raise civilian standards of consumption. There have been &quot;blood, sweat and. tears&quot; in war-time UnitedStates, but the sweat of the workers and the tears of those with sons, husbandsand sweethearts overseas, have not been made harder to bear by a blitzed or emptylarder.The war effort in the United States, in terms of the use of current resourcesas opposed to capital disinvestment, is of much the same proportionate magnitudeas in Britain. A rather smaller proportion of the population is in the armed forces, but a rather greater output of munitions per head has been obtained. TheUnited States has achieved this result by the apparently easy method of producingmore, whereas British civilians have been forced to consume less as well as towork harder. There are several reasons for this. Output per worker, particularlyin the metal-working trades, is far higher in the United States, so that a givenvolume of munitions can be produced by diverting fewer workers from civilianto war production. Further, the resources of the United States before the war were not only richer but also less fully utilised than in the United Kingdom.There was, in short, far more leisure in the United States in pre-war years thanin Britain. Some of the leisure was in the involuntary form of high unemploy-ment, but much of it was taken voluntarily in the shape of shorter hours, lateentry into trade and industry and early retirement. Finally, a high and growingproportion of the United States labour force was engaged in service trades andother less &quot; productive &quot; types of employment. . When it became necessary tobuild up and to supply large armed forces, therefore, the United States founditself with far greater resources to draw upon, and the mobilisation for war hadnot to proceed to such extremes as in the United Kingdom to achieve the sameproportionate volume of war production.* Gross figures - (i.e., without deduction for depreciation) including net exports andinventory changes.
Earnings in the United States.The national income of the United States (roughly, gross product lessdepreciation charges and business taxes) has been shared amongst the variouscontributors as follows :.&apos; Distribution of United States.National Income.(Department of Commerce.)National Income 19AS. 19A3. 1944.$ billions at current prices 1939. 1941. 1st Half. 2nd Half. 1st Half.(annual rate)       ...... 70-8 96-9 1AA-1 151-7 158-0Percentage to  .Wages and salaries*          ... 67-9 66-6 70-7 71-6 71-5Farm operators&apos; incomes    ... 6-1 6-5 8-5 81 8-other incomest        ...... 26-0 26-9 20-8 20-3 20 1Amongst the broad groups of the population, farmers have gained mostduring the war. Their net income in money terms is now three times what it wasin 1939 and, even if we allow, for the increased cost of living, their real incomehas at least doubled. The farmers&apos; share of the national income has increased from 6 per cent, before the war to 8-j per cent, of the present greatly increasedtotal. This is partly the result of the extraordinary increase in farm production(see Report No. 4, page 10) and partly because of the large rise in the prices of farm products which have about doubled since 1939.Workers have also made substantial gains, while those who depend on&quot;unearned&quot; income have lost ground during the war. Wages and salariesaccounted for nearly 72 per cent, of the national income by the end of 1943 ascompared with 68 per cent, in 1939 and less than 67 per cent, in 1941. The gain in the two years following Pearl Harbour was mainly in manufacturing industries. Since the latter part of 1943, however, the total payroll in manufacturing trades has been practically constant. The continued rise in the&quot; wages and salaries &quot; component of the national income during 1944 is due tothe increased pay and cash allowances of the armed forces (see Report No. 1,page 1).The September issue of Survey of Current Business includes an ingeniousanalysis of the growth in the wage payroll in. manufacturing industries up to january 1944.   The main results are summarised in the following table : Wage Earnings in United States Manufacturing Industries.$ billions, annual rate.Earnings, January 1944 ...       ...       ...       ...       32-1Earnings, January 1939 ...       ...       ...       ...        9-3N         Increase in earnings ...       ...       ... ... 22-8Due to increase in straight hourly wage-rates ... 7-2increased employment     ...       ...       ... ... 7-1increased hours and overtime rates      ... ... 5-9redistribution of workers among industries ... 2-6Higher wage rates, increased employment and longer hours have contributedabout equally to the growth in the total weekly earnings of workers in manu-facturing industries. A significant contribution has also been made by shiftsbetween industries, i.e., from the consumers&apos; goods trades with lower wages tothe metal-working industries with high rates of pay. There has been relatively little change in the manufacturing payroll since January of this year.A large reduction in the wage bill in manufacturing industries is inevitable in the reconversion and immediate post-war periods. Suppose, for example,that manufacturing industries returned to their pre-war size and that hours ofwork were reduced to the pre-war level while the wartime wage increases were retained. Then the yearly payroll in manufacturing trades would be cut nearlyin half, from $32 billions to $161 billions. The reduction to be expected, how&quot;-ever, is not as drastic as this since manufacturing industries will remain larger and more heavily concentrated in the metal-working trades than before the war.* Including armed forces&apos; pay and employers&apos; contributions to social security, pensionfunds, &amp;c.f Corporate profits, income of non-agricultural proprietors, rents and interest.
A reduction of the order of $10 billions in the yearly payroll is quite probable.This might be made up of $6 billions as a result of a return to pre-war hours,$2^ billions for reduced. employment in manufacturing (say a reduction of million wage earners out of the wartime increase of 5^ millions) and f l&apos;J billionsfor a redistribution of industries to something nearer the pre-war pattern.Personal Savings in the United States.The following table shows the disposition of income payments to individuals :Disposition of United States Income Payments.(Department of Commerce.)Percentage of individual incomeson Consumers&apos; expenditures*Personal taxesPurchase  of   U.S.   GovernmentsecuritiesOther net savings193987-24-38-5194180-54-33-911-31943       1943       19441st Half 2nd Half 1st Half64-9 63-0 61-8111      14-4      15110-014-09-413-210-612-5Until early in 1943, with only moderate increases in income taxation, thenet savings of individuals were rising rapidly, from less than 10 per cent, of total,income in 1939 to nearly one-quarter of the larger income in the first half of1943. Net savings include the purchase of war bonds and other United StatesGovernment securities which had risen to 10 per cent, of total income earlyin 1943. Subsequently, purchases of Government securities have gone up roughlyin proportion to income and the 10 per cent, ratio has been maintained. Therecent Eevenue Acts have increased tax payments sharply with a markeddepressive effect on savings (other than war bond purchases) as well as on con-sumption. Hence, total savings now7 form a smaller proportion of total incomethan in the early months of 1943, despite the fact that incomes have risen. Atpresent 15 per cent, of personal incomes is taken by income taxes, 10^ per cent,is spent on war bonds and other United States securities and 12-^ per cent, istaken up by other forms of saving.According to Department of Commerce estimates, new savings by individuals(including private businesses) since Pearl Harbour will aggregate more than$95 billions by the end of this year. Perhaps $20 billions represent investmentsin insurance, housing and debt liquidation which cannot be readily cashed forincreased spending on goods and services. The remaining $75 billions are heldin liquid forms, i.e., cash, bank deposits and Government securities. The Octoberissue of the Federal Reserve Bulletin includes an analysis of liquid assets held by individuals and by businesses.  The following are the main figures :Estimated Holdings of Liquid A ssets.(Federal Reserve Board.)EndHoldings by individuals  1941.Currency       ...       ...       ...       ...      8-6Demand deposits     ...       ...       ...     11-7Time deposits ...       ...       ...       ...     26-united States Government securities      12 - 0Total&apos;.........     58-3Holdings by unincorporated businesses! 7-0Holdings by corporationst        ...       ...     18-1All holdings  ....      ...    83-4$ billions.End1944-22-319136-4460123-817-248-9189-8Increase in three years.13-77-410-434-065-510-230-8106-5* See table on page 4 above for consumers&apos; expenditures in dollars.f 68 per cent, of the increased holdings by businesses are securities with most of theremaining increase in demand deposits.
It is not surprising that such large savings have been accumulated duringthe war, nor that they are mainly held in liquid forms. Apart from insurancepolicies; there is practically nothing available for direct investment, either by individuals or by corporations, under wartime controls. On the other hand,the war expenditures of the Government not covered by taxation must be met,generally speaking, by the issue of war bonds and other Government securities.Individuals and businesses take up these bonds, either directly or through thepurchase of Government securities by the banks out of increased deposits. Hencelarge war expenditures in excess of taxation automatically create large liquidassets in the hands of individuals and businesses. The question, of course, is what will happen to these liquid assets in the transition period.Attention is largely concentrated on the $65 billions of additional liquidholdings by private individuals. Much of this accumulation, perhaps$45-50 billions, is held by persons with incomes below $5,000 a year, i.e., by those who normally spend the bulk of their income. Part of these holdings may bein anticipation of post-war spending while many individuals, after building upholdings of liquid assets, may wish to spend more out of current income than inpre-war days. It is, in fact, a generally accepted view that the accumulatedsavings will stimulate post-war spending. This is, however, far from inevitableThree points on the other side can be made.In the first place, the^Government will presumably not wish to retire public debt in the transition period the easiest and most direct way for individualsto cash in war bonds. On the contrary, it is likely that additional bond driveswill be undertaken, and this means that an attempt will be made to getindividuals to hold and to increase their liquid assets. Secondly, the habit of saving and the preference for liquid assets may have been permanentlystrengthened as the result of the war, so that savings out of current income in the transition period may continue to be higher than before the war. Finally, thepresent level of individual holdings of cash, deposits and bonds, though very high on pre-war standards, may not be out of line with post-war needs. Incomesmay well remain at high levels and the need for liquid assets naturally rises withincomes and expenditures. The experience of the last war is relevant. Liquidassets held by individuals rose very sharply in 1917-19, but were not reducedduring the following decade.Combined Prodtiction and Resources -Board,Washington, D.C.,24th October, 1944.
