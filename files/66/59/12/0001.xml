THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYm^EKVPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET. , Copy No.W.P. (44) 712.6th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.COUNT SFORZA&apos;S LETTER TO Mr. BERLE OF 23rd SEPTEMBER, 1943.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN my statement in the House of Commons on the 1st December about theItalian situation I said that Count Sforza had told us some time ago that hewould pursue a certain course on his return to Italy, but that he did not pursue it.It may interest my colleagues to know exactly what pledges Count Sforza gaveto us. These were contained in a letter to Mr. Berle of the United States state department, which he confirmed to the Prime Minister on his way through theUnited Kingdom to Italy.   The text of this letter is given below : &apos;&apos; I have read with extreme interest the statement of Marshal Badoglio,issued on the 16th September, 1943, unequivocally stating that he considers the defeat of Germans and their expulsion from Italy to be his primaryduty, and urging all Italians to join in this struggle.&apos;&apos; In my view it now becomes the paramount duty of all Italians,irrespective of party or political differences, to support and assist in thestruggle to crush German arms and to drive every German soldier from italian soil.&apos;&apos; So long as Marshal Badogiio is engaged in that task and is acceptable to Allies in devoting Italian military material resources to that struggle,I consider it criminal to do anything to weaken his position or hamper hiswork in fighting for the liberation of Italy and the Italian people. I am prepared to offer my full support so long as he is thus engaged, all the morebecause this is the only way to destroy the last criminal remnants of Fascism.&quot; Matters of internal Italian politics can, and should be, adjourned forthe period of the struggle, and activities, military and political, of all Italianswho seek freedom and the future of their Fatherland should be devoted tosupporting the organised forces which are endeavouring to overthrow thecommon enemy. I pledge my honour to do this myself, and urge this courseon my many friends and associates.&quot;A. E.Foreign Office, 6th December, 1944..12594   [28771]
