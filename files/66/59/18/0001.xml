(44) 718.8th December, 1944. -WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.Introduction.1. Discussions on man-power in 1945 have so far proceeded on theassumption that the European war would have ended by 31st December, 1944.Estimates have been made by the Departments concerned of the numbers thatwould be required at the end of 1945 under that assumption in the Armed forces and in the various industries. A memorandum on these requirements is givenin Appendix I, as an indication of the man-power distribution to be aimed atduring the first year after the end of the European war under that assumption.2. In view of the present war situation it has become necessary, for planning purposes, to examine the man-power position in 1945 on the assumption that theEuropean war will continue until the middle of the year. Estimates of theman-power likely to be available under that assumption are given in the following paragraphs.Section I. Man-Power Position at End 1944.3. It is estimated that at the end of 1944 approximately 21,825,000 men aged 14-64 and women aged 14-59 will be in the Services, Civil Defence andIndustry (two part-time women being counted as a unit). This total, including;about 103,000 unemployed, will be distributed as follows : Forces...............      ... 4,913,000Civil Defence    ............... 246,000Industry  Group I Supply Depts.............. 4,013,000Other Depts., Export and Home Market 783,000Total............... 4,796,000Group II       ............... 5,721,000Group III      ...       ............ 6,046,000Unemployed...............     103,000Total Industry ......... 16,666,000Grand Total......... 21,825,000It is estimated that the total number in employment, i.e., excluding theunemployed, will be about 21,722,000.Section II. General Position in 1945.4. Leaving out of account the bulk transfer of man-power from the armed forces to civilian employment, the decline in the number of men and women in industry will be much greater in 1945 than it was in 1944, irrespective of the date,[28423] - b
in the first half of the year, on which the European war comes to an end. Thereasons are as follows : (1) New intake into industry from the non-industrial population will con-tinue to decrease. There will be no further registration of olderwomen under the Registration for Employment Order and the pressure on such women to take vital employment will be relaxed. There willalso be fewer juvenile new entrants.(2) The rate of normal wastage from industry especially among women,must be expected to increase. The return of substantial numbers ofmen from the Forces will result in an increase in marriages and in thenumbers of women who will wish to give up industrial employment.There will also be substantial reductions in the numbers employed on work for the Supply Departments. A large number of women will be released from munitions work and even in the first half of the year, ifthe European war is seen to be drawing to a close, it will be practically impossible to secure the retention of all these women in the industrial field.(3) The ending of the war with Germany will lead to the retirement from industry of very large numbers of married women and women over 50,who took employment under war-time conditions. It will be impossibleto compel such women to remain in industry. These retirements arelikely to occur within the first few months after the ending of theEuropean war.5. It is estimated that the net effect on the number in industry of the three factors mentioned in paragraph 4 above will be a decrease of not less than,150,000 in 1945. The numbers in the working population, including the armed forces, will also be affected by casualties and wastage from the Forces and by thereturn of prisoners of war.6. -The change in the working population, including the Forces, in 1945 maybe estimated as follows : Estimated   total   working  population   at1st January, 1945        ...Excess of. wastage and retirement  from industry   over   intake   from   civiliansources    ...       ...       ...       ...Casualties and wastage from the Forces,less returned prisoners of warTotal net loss to working popula-tion in 1945  ...Position at the 31st December, 1945 Estimated working population (includingunemployed)Estimated   numbers   likely   to   be   un-employed aboutEstimated numbers likely to be at work ...Section III.-Development of Man-Power Position in 1945.7. Under the assumption that the European war will continue until the30th June, 1945, the year will fall naturally into three parts, namely, the first half-year and the third and fourth quarters, the probable developments in whichare summarised below. The picture is presented in greater detail in paragraphs to 10.First half-year.(1) During the first half-year the European war will be drawing toa close. From the man-power point of view the main featurewill be the release of some 650,000 men and women from workfor the Supply Departments in the munitions industries. &apos; Thiswill enable an expansion of about 400,000 to be effected in industries serving civilian needs, including building and civil engineering, and in the export trade (see para. 8).1,150,00075,00021,825,0001,225,00020,600,000270,00020,330,000
Third quarter.(2) The ending of the European war by the middle of the year willP ensure the return to the Forces in the third quarter of prisonersof war and, with the continued call-up pf young men to enableadditional numbers of long-service men to be released at a later date, the nominal strength of the Forces will increase.   It will- not, however, be possible to effect any appreciable number of releases from the Forces under the Reallocation Scheme duringthis quarter. At the same time, industry will lose large numbersof married women and women over 50, without the possibilityof replacement from other sources. The numbers working forthe Supply Departments in the munitions industries will continueto decrease during the quarter but the rest of industry will alsosuffer a reduction (see para,. 9).Last quarter.(3) In the last quarter of the year considerable numbers of men andwomen will be released from the Forces, most of whom will enterindustry. There will be a further, though smaller,- fall in thenumbers working for the Supply Departments in the munitions industries, but on the other hand there is likely to be some increasein unemployment and the numbers in the rest of industry arenot likely to show any substantial increase (see para 10).(4) It is probable that in the second half of 1945 the net increase in civilian industry will not amount to more than 60,000. For theyear as a whole the increase is not likely to be greater than460,000.First half of 1945.8. -(1) It is estimated that during the first half of 1945 the working popu-lation including the Forces (men 14-64 and women 14-59) will fall by about330,000, mainly due to the excess of normal wastage in the industrial sectionover new intake.: (2) If the War Cabinet approve the proposals which will be submitted tothem for a further revision of the aircraft programme it is expected that about520,000 men and women will be released from aircraft work during the half-year. In addition, 100,000 will be released from Ministry of Supply work.The total reduction on work for the Supply Departments in the munitions industries will amount to about 650,000* men and women. This total will include about 20,000 young men fit for military service.(3) In the ordinary way, about 130,000 men and women could be provided under existing arrangements as intake into the Forces. 120,000 men will comefrom the new age class and from the normal lapse of short period deferments.There will also probably be about 10,000 women volunteers for the Women&apos;auxiliary Services. If the 20,000 fit young men released from munitions work,as mentioned above, were recruited for the Forces the total intake available under existing arrangements would be raised to 150,000.t If these 20,000 men were called up to the Forces, civilian industry would have to forgo an expansion that could otherwise be effected. This is an important question of policy on whicha decision is required before allocations for the first half of 1945 can be made.Given an intake into the Forces of 150,000 in the half-year it is probablethat the strength of the Forces will.fall during that period by about 50,000. Itwould not be possible to provide any additional intake into the Forces beyond* Estimates have been given in J.W.P.S. (44) 38 which were agreed by the Joint war production Staff on 22nd November, 1944 (J.W.P.S. (44) 8th Meeting) providing for reductions in the numbers of employees in the engineering and allied industries, shipbuilding, chemicals and explosives industries engaged on work for the Supply Departments. When these areadjusted to include the rest of the industries in Group I they involve the following reductions in the numbers aged 14-64/59 working for Supply Departments: First Half 1945      ...      .....     -   653,0003rd Quarter............    -   440,0004th Quarter ...       .........   -   197,000Total        ...       ...   - 1,290,000t It is expected that, although the direction of young men by ballot into coalmining willcontinue into 1945, the whole of the 140,000 men included in the total of 150,000 can be madeavailable for the forces.[28423J. - b 2
the total of 150,000 except as the result of most drastic measures for combingout young men from the munitions industries. It is a question whether, if such measures were put into operation, it would be possible to achieve the plannedprogrammes of the Ministry of Aircraft Production and Ministry of Supply.(4) It is expected that it will be possible to effect a reduction of 94,000in the number of whole-time workers employed in Civil Defence, thus reducingthe total to 152,000 and leaving a further reduction of 52,000 to be made in thesecond half of. the year.(5) On the foregoing basis there would be a reduction during the first halfof 1945 in the Forces, whole-time Civil Defence, and in the numbers working for Supply Departments in the munitions industries of about 797,000. As thetotal working population is expected to fall by about 330,000 during the half-year it should be possible to increase the man-power in industry outside theSupply Departments&apos; sector of Group I by about 467,000. It is most likely,however, that the heavy reductions contemplated in the numbers working for supply Departments in. Group I will be accompanied by some increase in temporary unemployment and the effective increase in the number working in therest of industry may not exceed 400,000.(6) On the assumption that intake into the Forces is limited to 150,000men and women during the half year, the net changes indicated in the foregoingsub-paragraphs may be summarised as follows : Increase.       Decrease.^) (&quot;)    .Working PopulationForces (intake 150,000; losses, say 200,000)net change        ............    -        ... - 50,000Civil Defence.......      ....... ... - 94,000Industry Group I, Supply Departments ... ... -653,000Group I, other Departments, Export &quot;1-&apos; and Home Market   ..........V   -\- 400,000Groups II and III      ...       ...       ...

(1) If the European war ends by the 30th June, 1945, the most important feature of the ensuing few months will be the retirement from industry of largenumbers of married women and women over 50. These may number at least500,000 during the third quarter (including part-time women-each counted ashalf a unit). On the other hand it would be unwise to count on the release for industry of any appreciable number of men and women from the Forces beyondthe yield from normal wastage. In such circumstances it is probable-that theworking population (including the Forces) will fall during the quarter by about500,000.(2) The strength of the Forces will be likely to increase by about 130,000because (a) considerable numbers of prisoners of war will have returned, and(b) intake of new man-power must be maintained in order to enable additionalnumbers of long-service men to be released at a later date.(3) The remainder of the cut in Civil Defence Services will be effectedduring this quarter, giving a reduction in strength of whole-time personnel of52,000.(4) There will be a reduction of about 440,000 in the numbers employed on work for the Supply Departments in Group I industries (see * footnote to para-graph 8 (2)).(5) The net change in the numbers in the Forces and Civil Defence Services,and in the numbers employed on work for the Supply Departments in Group I,will amount to a decrease of 362,000. If the total working population falls by ^500,000 as expected, there will accordingly be a drop of 138,000 in the numbers employed in industry outside the Supply Departments&apos; sector of Group I. Thisdrop will occur mainly as the result of normal and abnormal wastage whichit will not be possible to make good. Part of the planned reduction of 440,000in the numbers working for Supply Departments will be effected as the result ofsuch wastage. This wastage may lead to temporary shortages on various items ofmunitions work in which production must be maintained or even expanded for
the purpose of the Japanese war. To make good such shortages it will probablybe necessary to continue the transference of mobile workpeople from the rest ofindustry. The drain on non-munitions industries will thus consist of their ownnormal and abnormal wastage, together with some transference to the munitionsgroup. The total of these items will exceed the new intake, which will consist mainly of immobile juveniles.(6) In such circumstances there is unlikely to be any appreciable increase in umemployment, except perhaps among immobile women released from munitions work in difficult placing, areas.Last Quarter- of 1945.10. (1) In this quarter the working population will fall by about 400,000,and in view of the large-scale re-adjustments between the Forces and industry that will take place during the quarter there may be some increase in unemploy-ment perhaps by as much as 100,000. The number at work may thus be likelyto fall by about 500,000.(2) Substantial numbers of men and women will be released from the forces during the quarter under the Reallocation Scheme, and the strength-of the forces will probably be reduced by about 500,000.(3) The numbers employed on work for the Supply Departments in Group Iare expected to fall by about 197,000.(4) There should be no change in the whole-time strength of the Civil defence services which, in this quarter, will consist only of National Fire Service and police.(5) The total reduction in the Forces, Civil Defence Services, and in thenumbers working for Supply Departments in Group I would thus amount to697,000. This would offset the fall of 500,000 in the total number at work andwould leave 197,000 as the possible increase in the number in industry outside theSupply Departments&apos; sector of Group I.(6) Taken in conjunction with the expected decline of 138,000 in civilianindustry in the third quarter of the year, this means that there will probably bea net increase during the second half of the year of not more than 59,000 in civilian industry outside the Supply Departments&apos; sector of Group I.Development of Man-Power Position during 1945.   *11. The development of the man-power position in 1945 with intakes intothe Forces limited to the numbers that can be provided under existing arrange-ments may be summarised as-follows : (1) Estimated Strengths.ForcesCivil DefenceIndustry Supply Depts., Group IRest of IndustryUnemployed ...1st January.1945.4,913,000246,0004,013,00012,550,000103,00030th June,   30th September, 31st December.Total Working Population    21,825,0001945.4,863,000152,0003,360,000.12,950,000170,00021,495,0001945.4,993,000100,0002,920,00012,812,000170,00020,995,0001945.4,493,000100,0002,723,00013,009,000270,00020,595,000(2)&apos; Estimated Changes.Forces        ...       - -      : - -Civil DefenceIndustry Supply Depts., Group IRest of IndustryUnemployedTotal Working PopulationFirstHalf-Year.- 50,000- 94,000- 653,000-f 400,000+ 67,000330,000ThirdQuarter.4-130,000- 52,000- 440,000- 138,000- 500,000LastQuarter.-500,000- 197,000-1-197,0004- 100,000-400,000WholeYear.- 420,000- 146,000.- 1,290,0004- 459,000-f-   167,000. - 1,230.000
Position at the end of the year.12. If all the 500,000 men and women released from the Forces in the last quarter of the year enter employment by the end of the year the number in industry taken as a whole will still be about 831,000 below the number at theend.of 1944. A decrease of 1,290,000 is expected in the numbers employed on work for the Supply Departments in Group I industries and consequently theexpansion in the rest of industry during the year will amount to about 459,000.A large part of this increase will be required in Group I industries for therestoration of plant and machinery and for exports, and in Group III for thebuilding and civil engineering industries. It is therefore doubtful whether itwill be possible to effect any substantial improvement by the end of 1945 in theGroup II industries or in the Group.Ill industries manufacturing mainly for civilian needs.13. An advancement of the date on which the European war comes to anend would have a marked effect on the numbers available for civilian industry,particularly in the third and fourth quarters of the year. If, for example, thewar ended by the 31st March, substantial numbers of men and women would be released from the Forces in the third as well as the fourth quarter, and there might also be a further reduction, beyond that already planned, in the numbersworking for Supply Departments. The numbers available for the rest ofindustry would show an increase even in the third quarter and it is probablethat the net increase over the year as a whole might be between 1^ and 1^ millioninstead of the 459,000 shown in paragraph 12 above. On the other hand a postponement, say to the 30th September, of the end of the European war might have a serious effect on civilian industry in the last quarter of the year.This arises from the fact that while large numbers of women would retire from industry there would be no replacement by men released from the Forces underthe Reallocation Scheme. While, therefore, there might be a moderate increasein the numbers employed in civilian industry in each of the first three quarters,there might be a decline of well over 500,000 in the last quarter.14. The annual Man-Power Survey covering the period mid-1939 to mid-1944 is given in Appendix II.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,8th December, 1944.
APPENDIX I.ESTIMATED REQUIREMENTS FOR 1945 IF THE EUROPEAN WARENDED BY 31st DECEMBER, 19M.1. Forces.The requirements for the first year of Stage II, with the European wax-ending by the 31st December, 1944, as put forward by the Chiefs of Staff, pro-vided for a total of 2,850,000 in the Forces at the end of 1945. This is 554,500less than the total of 3,404,500 originally put forward (W.P. (44) 380), but it is150,000 greater than the figure proposed in the Prime Ministers directive(W.P. (44) 431).2. Civil Defence.The Ministry of Home Security have proposed a total of about 100,000whole-time personnel for the Police and the National Fire Service. This wouldmean a reduction of 146,000 from the total Civil Defence figure authorised forthe 31st December, 1944.3. Industry.(1) Group I (Munitions) : (a) Supply Departments. In July last theMinister of Production suggested a total of 2,650,000 for munitions employeesone year after the defeat of Germany. (When adjusted for other elements inGroup I industries the 2,650,000 becomes 2,723,000.) The figure was based on the assumptions of July regarding Service commitments in Stage II. These have since been reduced. The Prime Minister has proposed a cut of 400,000 in theSupply Department total, reducing it to 2,323,000.(b) Other Departments, Home Market and Export. The estimates of theBoard of Trade and Ministry of Supply involved a total employed labour force at the end of 1945 in Group I industries of 2,175,000 (viz., 2,163;000 as given in w.P. (44) 362, Appendix, with the addition of 12,000 proposed by the Board ofTrade on the 2nd October, 1944).  The grand total for Group I is &quot;thus 4,498,000.(2) Group II (Basic Industries). The estimates of Departments forGroup II (W.P. (44) 362, Appendix) amounted to a total of 6,007,000. This&apos;included 1,003,000 for National Government Service, but this is subject to any reduction between the 1st April, 1944, and the end of 1945 that might be effected in Departmental Industrial Staffs, N.A.A.F.I. and Royal Observer Corps. at mid-1944 these three items included 450,526 men and women. In view of theproposed substantial reduction in the strength of the Armed Forces it would seem a reduction of at least 100,000 could safely be assumed. This would give a totalrequirement for Group II of 5,907,000.(3) Group III (Less Essential Industries). The total requirement estimated for this Group was 7,307,000 in employment (excluding the provision originally proposed, but later abandoned, of 100,000 for prefabricated houses). ThePrime Ministers directive of the 3rd August, 1944, proposed a reduction of theGroup III total and the Board of Trade have put forward proposals whichwould reduce the total requirement for Group III to 7,179,000. This figure,however, included only 927,000 for building and civil engineering, this beingthe estimate of the numbers likely to be available on the assumption that thereduction in the strength of the Forces in 1945 would not exceed 1,400,000. Inview of the revised reallocation proposals, which involve a much greater release from the Forces in the first year of Stage II, the estimate of the number likelyto be available for building and civil engineering has been revised and is now put at 1,100,000, an increase of 173,000. This raises the total requirement forGroup III to 7,352,000 (excluding any additional provision that may be requiredfor prefabricated houses). &apos;(4) Industry [All Groups). The total requirement for the three industrialgroups taken together thus amounted to 17,757,000.4. Total requirements. The total requirement for the Forces, civil defence and Industry at the end of 1945 amounted to 20,707,000.
Comparison between employment end-1944: and requirements end-194i5.5. The comparison between the actual numbers in employment at the31st December, 1944, and the requirements for the 31st December, 1945, withthe European war ending by the 31st December, 1944, would be as follows : Number in Estimatedemployment at requirements for31st December, 31st December,     Increase (4-)-1944. 1945.

The total outflow from the Forces (i.e., casualties, discharges andreleases) would exceed the net decrease of 2,063,000 by a number equivalent tothe total intake into the Forces during the year. As regards men, it appearsprobable that about 200,000 would become available for the Forces from the newage-class reaching 18 and that at least another 100,000 hitherto retained in industry could be released for military service a total of 300,000. As regardswomen, it is likely that the flow of volunteers from the age-classes 17-^-19 forthe Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services would be smaller during Stage II than it is atpresent, and the intake from this source may be put tentatively at 25,000 forthe year. The total fresh intake into the Forces for the year might thus be inthe neighbourhood of 325,000; taking into account returned prisoners of war, thetotal intake might be about 450,000. On that basis there should have been atotal outflow from the Forces during 1945 of 2,512,000.A nalysis of requirements.7.

Munitions   Industries Numbers   Employed   on   Work   for   Supply   Departments,1st January, 1941, to the 1st July, 1944.Summary,Distribution of the Population.i. At mid-1944 out of a total population of rather more than 33 millionpersons of working age (14-64) over 22^ million (nearly 15 million men and morethan 7\ million women) were engaged in some form of employment or service.about 900,000 of the. women were in part-time employment (para. 3).2. The extent to which persons who did not work in industry before the war have been drawn into employment is shown by the reduction of 2,400,000 (400,000men and 2 million women) in the &quot; non-industrial &quot; section of the populationbetween 1939 and 1944 (para. 5).3. The numbers in the Armed Forces, Civil Defence Services and Industryreached its peak towards the end of 1943. In consequence the wastage out ofthe industrial field during the year mid-1943 to mid-1944 exceeded the diminishednew intake, and there was an increase in the &apos;&apos; non-industrial &apos;&apos; section of 72,000men and 121,000 women (para. 6).4. Mobilisation for immediate war purposes, however, continued. Anincrease of 330,000 in the Armed Forces, Civilian staffs of Service Departments,the transport services and agriculture was made possible by further reductions in Civil Defence Services and the rest of industry.5. At mid-1944, 7,950,000 men (aged 14-64) and 2,380,000 women (aged14-59) were in the Forces, full-time Civil Defence and munitions; 4,080,000 menand 1,650,000 women in the principal basic industries (Group II); and 2,940,000men and 3,120,000 women in other industries (Group III) (para. 9 andTables 1 to 3).Comparison between. 1918, 1943 and 1944.6. Mobilisation of man-power had gone much further towards the end of thefourth year of this war than it had by the end of the fourth year of the last war,32 - 4 per cent, of the population at mid-1943 being in the Forces, full-time civil defence and munitions compared with 27-8 per cent, in 1918, 17-7 per cent, inother essential industries compared with 15-3 per cent., and 49-9 per cent, inother industries and the non-industrial section of the population compared with56-9 per cent, in 1918. The broad percentage analysis for mid-1944 was similarto that for mid-1943 (para. 10).
Industry.7. There has been a decrease of the total labour force in industry betweenmid-1939 and mid-1944 of 2,400,000, a decrease of 3,889,000 men being partly offset by- an increase of 1,489,000; women (paras. 22 and 23).8. Employment in the munitions industries reached its peak in November1943; during the year ended mid-1944 it showed a decrease of 100,000 men and82,&apos;000 women (para, 28).,The numbers in the munitions industries at mid-1944 exceeded the numbers at mid-1939 by 453,000 men (16-4 per cent.) and 1,326,000 women (249-3 per cent.)(para. 27).9. Group II industries decreased during the four years 1939-43 by262,000, a decrease of 973,000 men being partly offset by an increase of 711,000women. During the year mid-1943 to mid-1944 there was an increase of 71,000(men 19,000 and women 52,000) mainly due to the expansion of inland transport inconnection with the invasion of Europe (paras. 38-40 and Tables 1-3).10. &quot;Agriculture increased during the year mid-1943 to mid-1944 by 7,000men and 11,000 women (para. 41).11. Civil Establishments of Government Departments increased during theyear by 29,000, men by 5.000 and women 24,000. In the five years mid-1939 to mid-1944 Government Departments have expanded by 93,000 men and 372.000women (para. 41).12. Group III industries decreased between mid-1939 and mid-1944 by ,988,000 made&apos; up of 3,388,000 men and 600,000 women; this represents a loss of nearly 40 per cent, of their total labour force nearly 54 per cent, of their men andover 16 per cent, of their women (para. 48).13. Group III industries decreased between mid-1943 and mid-1944 by276,000, made up of 192,000 men and 84,000 women (para. 49).Fit men of Military Age.14. It is proposed that after the end of the European war men in the10 years age range from 18 to .27 inclusive should be liable for calling-up. Thetotal number of medically fit men born in the years 1917 to mid-1926 who werereserved or whose calling-up had been &quot;deferred at mid-1944 was about 514,000(paras. 89 and 90).15. Of the total of 514,000, 438,000 were in munitions, agriculture and mining, and 39,000 were in the remaining Group II industries. Group IIIindustries include only about 20,000 (paras. 90 and 91).Women.16. At mid-1944 there were 16,020,000 women aged 14-59; of these 8,664,000were in the age-class 18-40. Of the 8,664,000 aged 18-40 3,274,000 were single,1,679,000 were married without children under 14 living with them, and 3,711,000were married with young children (para&apos; 92).17. At. mid-1944 there were 7,152,000 women aged 14-59 in the Forces,Civil Defence and industry; of these 4,498,000 were aged 18-40 (para. 92).18. Among women aged 18-40, 87 per cent, of the single women, 74-4 percent, of the married women and widows without young children and 10 - 8 per cent,of the married women and widows with young children were in the Forces,full-time Civil Defence and industry. Among women aged 41 and under 60, nearly35 per cent, of those aged 41-50 and over 21 per cent, of those aged 51 and under60 were similarly employed (paras. 92 to 94).19. Single women are a high proportion of the total aged 18-59 in Group II(paras. 95-96).20. The majority of the women drawn into the employment field sincemid-1939 have been in the 18-40 age group. In this group the &quot; non-industrial &quot;class, together with the unemployed, fell by 1,448,000 between mid-1939 and mid-1944. The Corresponding decrease in the 41-59 age group was 657,000(para. 97).[28423]
SURVEY OF MAN-POWER MID-1944.(Note. All the figures for mid-1944 are provisional and subject to revision.)I. Age Analysis of the Population Men aged 14-64 and Women aged 14-59in Great Britain.1. The following Table gives an approximate age analysis of the population(14-64 men and 14-59 women)(&apos;) in Great Britain at mid-1939, mid-1941, mid-1942, mid-1943 and mid-1944 :-(Thousands)Date.Men, 14-64-Mid-1939Mid-1941Mid-1942Mid-1943Mid-1944Women, 14-59-Mid-1939Mid-1941   .Mid-1942Mid-1943Mid-1944TOTAL^-Mid-1939Mid-1941Mid-1942Mid-1943Mjd-194414-17.1,5191,4271,3881,3621,3371,5101,4151,3801,3501,3253,0292,8422,7682,7122,66218-20.1,1881,1951,1421,0971,0751,1831,2001,1421,0951,0682,3712,3952,2842,1922,14321-40.     41-64/59.7,3607,3307,3007,2727,2267,5307,5407,5807,6117,59614,89014,87014,88014,88314,8225,9436,0256,1046,1906,2725,8175,8755,9285,9646,08111,76011,90012,03212,15412,303Total.16,01015,97715,93415,92115,91016,04016,03016,03016,02016,02082,05032,00731,96431,94131,9302.   Since the outbreak of war the following changes have occurred : (1) The number of boys aged 14-17 has fallen by 182,000, and the numberof girls by 185,000. These decreases are due to the fall in the birthrate between 1921 and 1930, which is having an important bearing on the supply of young man-power for the Services and for industry.Its effect is already seen in the reduced numbers reaching military age and the age when labour becomes fully mobile.(2) There are decreases also in the numbers aged 18-40. The number ofmen has dropped by 247,000, partly due to war casualties, and thenumber of women by 49,000.(3) The number of men aged 41-64 has increased by 329,000, and the numberof women aged 41-59 by 214,000. Attention has frequently been directed in recent years to the increasing numbers in the higher age groups of the population. This is leading to an increased rate of wastage among the working population through invalidity and thehigher death rate.(4) The total population of the ages shown above has fallen by 120,000; thenumber of men has decreased by 100,000 and the number of womenby 20,000.II. Population aged 14-64.3. The estimated population of working age (14-64 inclusive) of GreatBritain at mid-1944 was about 33,190,000, including 15,910,000 men and17,280,000 women. The total number aged 14-64 in paid employment was about22,621,000 including 14,967,000 men and 7,654,000 women, of whom about 900,000were in part-time employment. (2) In addition there were about 1,000,000 men andwomen aged 65 and over in paid employment, and at least 1,000,000 women ofall ages rendering voluntary unpaid service-mostly on a part-time basis.(x) The figures for mid-1941, mid-1942, mid-1948 and mid-1944 are estimates made in theMinistry of Labour and National Service. They may be subject to a margin of error, but this isnot likely to be large enough to invalidate the conclusions drawn from the estimates. The figuresexclude men from the Forces who are prisoners of war and those returned as &quot; missing.&quot;(2) In all other parts of this survey two part-time women are counted as equivalent to onefull-time worker.
HI. Distribution of the Population-Armed Forces, full-time Civil defence and Industry.4. The distribution of the population (men aged 14-64 and women 14-59)among the Forces, full-time Civil Defence, Industry, and the &quot; non-industrial &quot;section at mid-1939 and at the middle of each year from mid-1941 to mid-1944inclusive was at follows : Alined Forces Men      ......Women  ...Total  ...Full-time Civil Defence-Men       ...       ...Women ...Total  ...Mid-1939.4774778080Mid-1941.3,2711033,37432459383(Thousands.)Mid-1942.

Women.4-218 4- 6- 28 - 13-273      -114- 834- 721214-1216. The number of men and women in the Armed Forces, Civil defence services and Industry reached its peak towards the end of 1943. By then all new sources of man-power had been virtually exhausted. Women up to age 50 hadbeen registered under the Registration for Employment Order and this completed the Governments programme of such registrations. By the end of 1943 the occupied population was composed to a substantial extent of women who wouldnot have entered industry except under the pressure of war-time demands and for( whom industrial employment raised acute domestic problems. From that pointnormal wastage was bound to run at a comparatively high level while, on theother hand, new intake was bound to diminish and would consist to a.muchgreater extent than in previous war years of juveniles entering employment for thefirst time. Among men, casualties in the Armed Forces had a correspondingeffect, first in reducing the total male population, and secondly in increasingthe non-industrial section.   These factors are reflected (a) in the fall of the total
population between mid-1943 and mid-1944 from 31,941,000 to 31,930,000;(b) in the increase of the non-industrial section by 72,000 men and 121,00*women; (c) in the fall of the occupied population by 83,000 men and 121,000women.7. The Table in paragraph 4 shows that up to mid-1%43 there had beend net increase of 364,000 men and 2,134,000 women or a total of 2,498,000 menand women in the Forces, full-time Civil Defence and industry. The number inthe non-industrial section fell between tomM939 and mid-1943 by 453,000 menand 2,154,000 women or a total of 2,607,000. The total numbers recruited duringthe war from the non-industrial section of the population have considerablyexceeded these figures and probably the total is well in excess of 3 millions. Thereduction in the number in the non-industrial section of the population hasoccurred over and, above the normal movement into industry of boys and girlsleaving school. This movement counter-balances the normal xvastage from theworking population due to death, invalidity and retirement and has not beentaken into account in the figures given above of mobilisation from the non-industrial section for war-time purposes. For the reasons given in paragraph 6the figures for the year mid-1943 to mid-1944: show an increase of 193,000 in thenon-industrial section of the population and a decrease of 204,000 in the number in the Armed Forces, Civil Defence and Industry. Nevertheless, at mid-1944 outof the total of nearly 32 millions there were still over 22,100,000 (15 million men7,100,000 women) engaged in some form of employment or service for the country:8. Mobilisation for immediate war purposes, however, continued. Betweenmid-1943 arid mid-1944 there was an increase of 224,000 men and women in the armed Forces and of 106,000 in the civilian and industrial staffs of service departments, the transport services and agriculture. These increases were made possible by reductions in the numbers in Civil Defence and in the rest of industry.9. Ah analysis of the movements summarised above is shown by thefollowing Tables.

Mobilisation of man-power had. gone further towards the end of thefourth year of this war than it had by the end of the fourth year of the last war.This is brought out by the following Table giving an estimated distribution ofthe adult population (men 14-64; women 14-59) in 1918 and at mid-1943 and mid-1944 :-Distribution of Population.Men 14-64; Women 14-59.

At mid-1943, 32-4 per cent, of the population -was occupied in the FightingServices, full-time Civil Defence and the munitions industries, as compared with27.-8 per cent, in 1918. The proportion in industry Group II was also larger(17-7 per cent, as compared with 15-3 per cent.) owing to the greater numbers in National and Local Government: By mid-1944 this figure had increased to17-9 per cent. The numbers in industry Group III and the non-industrial population represented. 49-9 per cent, of the total at mid-1943 and 49-8 per cent,at mid-1944, as compared with 56-9 per cent, in 1918.11. Differences in the character of the two wars affect detailed comparison,particularly as between men and women. Greater mechanisation of the armed forces and the larger programmes of factory building, airfield and campconstruction and repair of air-raid damage have made it necessary to retain agreater proportion of men in industry. Consequently, the Fighting Services and full-time Civil Defence included a smaller proportion of the male population at mid-1944 than in 1918. On the other hand, women have been brought directlyinto the war effort to a far greater extent. These points are brought out in thefollowing Tables for men and women separately : Men 14-64.

The Fighting Services and full-time Civil Defence absorbed 4,730,000men, or 29-7 per cent, of the total at mid-1944, as compared with 4,600,000, or34-1 per cent&apos;., in 1918. Casualties in the last war were much heavier than theyhave been in-the present war, and if they were included in the figures the number and proportion of men mobilised for the Fighting Services would be shown to be higher than in 1944. On the other hand, the number of men in the munitions industries is now over 50 per cent, greater than it was in 1918 and represents20-3 per cent, of the male population of working age, as compared with-15-7 percent, in 1918. The Fighting Services, full-time Civil Defence and the munitions industries now include 7,950,000 men, or 50-0 per cent., as compared with6,720,000, or 49-8 per cent., in 1918. The number of men retained in IndustryGroup II is 760,000 greater now than it was in 1918. These industries include25-5 per cent, of the adult male population as compared with 24-6 in 1918.13In the case of women, 25-2 per cent, of those aged 14-59 are now inthe Fighting Services, full-time Civil Defence and the munitions and Group IIindustries, as compared with 13-5 per cent, in 1918.   The proportion in the
Fighting Services and the munitions industries is more than double the propor-tion in 1918 (14-9 per cent, as compared with 7 per cent.).   This increase&quot;represents 1,370,000 women.Y.-Armed Forces.14.   Men.

23. These Tables show that there has been a decrease of the total labour forcein industry between mid-19%9 and mid-1944 of 2,400,000, a decrease of 3,889,000men being partly offset by an increase of 1,489,000 women. In Group I andGroup II together there has been an increase of 2,089,000 women..24. Over half the man-power for the Forces has been recruited from industry Group III, which mainly serves civilian needs. While in certain of these industries a large proportion of the men thus withdrawn have been replaced by women, there has been, at the same time, a very substantial transference of women from Group III &quot;to the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and the munitions industries.The net effect on the industrial distribution of women is shown by the fact that although the total number in industry has increased since mid-1939 by 1,489,000the proportion in Group III has dropped from 72-4 to 47-1 per cent, (the number in Group III has fallen by 600,000).Changes mid-1943 to mid-1944.25.

The total labour force in industry thus declined between mid-1943 and mid-1944 by 387,000 273,000 men and 114,000 women. There were decreasesamong both men and women in Group I and Group III. These were due to thewithdrawal of men for the Forces and the decline referred to in para. 6 in thenumber of mobilised women. The increases in Group II were largely due tothe requirements of the invasion of Europe as regards transport services andthe expansion of the industrial staffs of Service Departments.Group I (Munitions). .-Changes mid-1939 to mid-1944.^)27. At mid-1944 there were approximately 3,222,000 men aged 14-64 and1,858,000 women aged 14-59 in this group, making a total of 5,080,000. Thegroup included, at mid-1944, 30 -1 per cent, of the total labour force in industry as compared with 17-1 per cent, at mid-1939.

Of the total net increase of 1,779,000 between mid-1939 and mid-1944more than half (985,000)&quot; occurred in the two years to mid-1941. The increase of737,000 in the year 1941-42, when mobilisation under the Registration for employment Order was most active, was not much less, but the approachingexhaustion of man-power resources brought the increase in 1942-43 down to239,000. In 1943-44 there was a decrease of 182,000 for the reasons given in para. 6.30. Men. The following Table gives a broad age analysis of the 3,222,000men aged 14-64 at mid-1944 : Age Group. Number.

It is estimated that there were in the munitions group 228,000 men aged18 and under 27^ who were medically fit for service with the Forces, including32,000 apprentices. This is 44-3 per cent, of the total number of fit men of thoseages.   The great bulk of these men are in skilled occupations.33. Women. Women now represent 36-6 per cent, of the labour force inthe munitions group as compared with 16 -1 per cent, at mid-1939.34.

In the group taken as a whole there was a substantial increase in1943-44 among both men and ivomen. This was mainly due to the expansion of inland transport in connection with the invasion of Europe, an increase in national Government Service (industrial staffs of Service Departments) for thesame purpose, and some increase in agriculture. The number of men increased- by19,000 and the number of women by 52,000. In the five years mid-1939 to mid-1944 the number in the group decreased by 191,000, an increase of 763,000women being offset by a decrease of 954,000 men.41.

The increase in the number of women since 1939 is accounted forby commerce, banking, insurance and finance and professional services. Inthe former a substantial withdrawal of men since mid-1939, equivalent to about60 per cent, of the total male labour force, has been partly counter-balanced bythe intake of women. In both 1942-43 and 1943-44 there were slight reductions in the number.of women. In professional services the increase in the number ofwomen is accounted for largely by the intake of women into hospital service. Thisintake continued up to June 1944. There have been substantial reductions amongboth men and women in hotels, public-houses, restaurants, &amp;c, laundries andcleaning.

VIII. Numbers of Men aged 18 and under 27 , medically fit for service withthe Forces, in Civil Employment.89. It is proposed that after the end of the European war men in the10 years age range from 18 to 27 inclusive should be liable for calling up. Table 6(page 29) shows the estimated numbers of men aged 18 and under 27J (i-e, thoseborn between the 1st January, 1917, and the 30th June, 1926) in various industrygroups at mid-1944 who were medically fit for service with the Forces. Thefigures exclude men who had been medically examined and were available forimmediate call-up to the Forces and also men in the Deferred Service Lists of theRoyal Navy and Royal Air Force.   They also exclude men in the Merchant Navy.90.

The peak of the mobilisation of women for war employment wasreached towards the end of 1943. Additional recruits, particularly from the older age-groups, continued to be drawn into the employment field, but overthe field as a whole the new intake between mid-1943 and mid-1944 was not sufficient to replace losses and the proportion of women aged 14-59 in employ-ment fell from 45-4 per cent, at the former date to 44-6 per cent, at the latterdate.94.   Among single women aged 14r-59 the proportion in the auxiliary services, full-time Civil Defence and industry at mid-1944 was 79 1 per cent.,.,and for married women and widows the corresponding proportions were 39 - 6 percent, among those without children under 14 and 12 per cent, among those with children.In the 18-40 age-group, 87 per cent, of the single women, 74-4 per cent, of the married women and widows without young children, and 10-8 per cent, of the married women and widows with young children were in the Forces, full-time civil defence and industry. Among women over 40, nearly 35 per cent, of those aged41-50 and over 21 per cent, of those aged 51-59 were similarly employed.95. The industrial distribution of women aged 18-59 at mid-1944 is shownin the following Table, which distinguishes separately (a) the age groups 18-40and 41-59, and (6) within each of these groups single women and married women and widows.

The Table shows that in Group II the proportion of single women employed is well above the average for other industries. The figures are asfollows: Proportion of Single Women Fjmployed.18-40-Per cent.Group I ...      ...       ...       ...       ...      59Group group iii all industries65565941-59.Per cent.26564041The high proportion of single women in Group II is accounted for by A griculture,National and Local Government Services (including full-time Civil Defence).In munitions the proportion of married women and widows in the 41-59 age group is particularly high 241,000 out of a total of 325,000. This reflects the intensive recruitment of women for war work from the non-industrial sectionof the population. . .97. Changes mid-1939 to mid-1944:.

Womenaged 41-59 have accounted for over 500,000 of the increase in the munitions and principal basic industries; and furthermore the increase of over 300,000 in thisage-group in Group III industries and services has facilitated the withdrawal ofyounger women from those industries for other work.
