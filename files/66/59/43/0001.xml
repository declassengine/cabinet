THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTOP SECRET.Prime Minister to President Roosevelt. No. 755.   17.8.44.Personal and Top Secret.1. We have always marched together in complete agreement about Greekpolicy, and I refer to you on every important point. The War Cabinet andForeign Secretary are much concerned about what will happen in Athens, and indeed in Greece, when the Germans crack or when their divisions try to evacuatethe country. If there is a long hiatus after German authorities have gone fromcity before organised Government can be set up, it seems very likely that E.A.M.and the Communist extremists will attempt to seize the city and. crush all other form of Greek expression but their own.2. You and I have always agreed that the destinies of Greece are in thehands of the Greek people, and that they will have the fullest opportunity of deciding between a monarchy or republic as soon as tranquillity has been restored,but I do not expect you will relish more than I do the prospect either of chaosand street fighting or of a tyrannical Communist Government being set up. this could only serve to delay and hamper all the plans which are being made by .N.R.R.A. for the distribution of relief to the sorely tried Greek people. i therefore think that we should make preparations through the Allied Staff in theMediterranean to have in readiness a British force, not exceeding 10,000 men,which could be sent by the most expeditious means into the capital when thetime is ripe. The force would include parachute troops, for which the help ofyour Air Force would be needed. I do not myself expect that anything willhappen for a month, and it may be longer, but it is always well to be prepared.As far as I can see there will be no insuperable difficulty. I hope, therefore, youwill agree that we may make these preparations by the Staffs out here in theusual way. If so, the British Chiefs of Staff will submit to the Combined Chiefsof Staff draft instructions to General Wilson.President Roosevelt to Prime Minister. No. 608.   26.8.44.Personal.Your 755.I have no objection to your making preparations to have in readiness asufficient British Force to preserve order in Greece when the German Forcesevacuate that country. There is also no objection to the use by General Wilsonof American Transport Airplanes that are available to him at that time and that can be spared from his other operations.The Caserta Agreement.*At a conference presided over by the Supreme Allied CommanderMediterranean theatre at A.F. Headquarters, at which the Greek President ofthe Council with other members of the Greek Government and the GreekGuerilla leaders Generals Sarafis and Zervas were present, the followingdecisions were recorded, as having been accepted unanimously : 1. All guerilla forces operating in Greece place themselves under orders to the Greek Government [ ? Grp. omitted : ? of ] National Unity.2. The Greek Government places these forces under the orders of GeneralScobie who has been nominated by the Supreme Allied Commander as general-Officer-Commanding forces in Greece.* This text is taken from Telegram No. 408 from the Resident Minister Central Mediter-ranean to Foreign Office, dated 26th September, 1944.[28849]
3. In accordance with the proclamation issued by the Greek Government,the Greek guerilla, leaders declare that they will forbid any attempt by anyunits under&apos; their command to take the law into their own hands. Such action will be treated as a crime and will be punished accordingly.4. As regards Athens, no action is to be taken save under the direct orders rof General Scobie, General-Officer-Commanding forces in Greece.5. Security battalions are considered as instruments of the enemy. unless they surrender according to orders issued by General-Officer-Commanding theywill be treated as enemy formations.6. All Greek guerilla forces, in order to put an end to past rivalries,declare that they Will form a national union in order to co-ordinate their activities in the best interests of the common struggle.7. In accordance with the powers conferred on him by the Supreme allied commander after agreement with the Greek Government, General Scobie has issued attached operational orders.
