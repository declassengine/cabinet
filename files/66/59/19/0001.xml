(44) 719.8th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.CANADIAN CONSCRIPTION CRISIS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I annex, for the information of&apos;the War Cabinet, a despatch from the UnitedKingdom Deputy High Commissioner at Ottawa reporting on the developments which took place on the question of reinforcements for the Canadian Army afterColonel Ralston&apos;s resignation and General McNaughton&apos;s appointment as  minister for National Defence. ,C.Dominions Office,8th December, 1944.Sir Patrick Duff to Viscount Cranborne.Office of the High Commissioner for theUnited Kingdom,(No. 620.) - Eamscliffe, Ottawa,My Lord, 11th November, 1944.I have the honour to report to your Lordship on the developments which havetaken place on the question of reinforcements for the Canadian Army sinceColonel Ralston&apos;s resignation &amp;ahd General McNaughton&apos;s appointment as  minister for National Defence.2. The crisis which had rocked the Canadian Cabinet for ten days reached a climax on the 2nd November when it was announced that Colonel Ralston&apos;resignation had been accepted and that General McNaughton had been appointedto replace him. At a press conference on that day, Mr. Mackenzie King brieflyannounced the change and said that this was all he had to say at that time,&quot; Everything speaks for itself &quot; was his laconic reply to questions from the press.And it is a remarkable thing that for days on end after this, everything wenton &quot; speaking for itself &quot; except the Prime Minister and Colonel Ralston, thelatter of whom has not spoken even yet. General McNaughton was no moreinformative, and merely stated that he had undertaken his task &quot; in order toserve Canada and for no other purpose, and to ensure that the Army overseasreceives support in a way it is most needed.&quot;3. General McNaughton&apos;s appointment took the public completely bysurprise and there was general bewilderment and a loud spoken demand for full information on the subject. Mr. Bracken said at first that he preferred to make no statement until the Prime Minister had advised the Canadian people of thesituation; he declared that the people of Canada were deeply concerned aboutthe position and deserved to be told the truth in the frankest possible terms.After issuing two written statements confined to demanding a full disclosure ofthe facts, Mr. Bracken subsequently, after the Prime Minister&apos;s broadcast onthe 8th November, authorised a third statement for publication : In this he said&quot; It is crystal clear that Mr. King has betrayed his trust and deceived both thearmy overseas and the people at home. It is more than evident now that he never did intend to implement his undertakings given to Parliament.&quot; Regarding[28788] f. B I
the stand of the Progressive Conservative party in the matter, he said, &quot; I need not restate the strong stand that the Progressive Conservative party hastaken in regard to overseas reinforcements. Since I assumed leadership, wehave repeatedly urged that these men (i.e., the Home Defence Army) be sent overseas to fill the gap which now is so tragically revealed.&quot; Mr. Coldwell simi-larly demanded that the Prime Minister should make a statement to Parliament&apos;&apos; to quell rumours &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; should not wait until January to do it&apos;&apos; *(Parlia-ment does not meet till the end of January, unless specially summoned meanwhile).On the general question, Mr. Coldwell said, &quot; Whatever is necessary to keep upreinforcements that we have to do.&quot; He added: &quot;If total conscription is needed, let us have it -all out. Not only conscription of our sons&apos; bodies, butconscription of industry and of wealth. We shall continue to demand that, evenif total conscription of men is ordered.&quot;4. For some days, while it was well known that Colonel Ralston had, infact, resigned on the issue of conscription for overseas service, the Canadianpublic were without official confirmation. The first indication of the Govern-ment&apos;s policy came in an address which General McNaughton gave at a meeting,arranged long before the development of these events, at Arnprior on the5th November. In his speech on that occasion, he made it clear that he favoured the continuance of the voluntary system of enlistment in Canada. He indicatedhis opposition to conscripting Home Defence troops for overseas saying that hewas &apos;&apos; firmly convinced that the best hope lies in the maintenance of our longtraditions of voluntary service.&quot; He added that the figures showed that Canadacould &apos;&apos; safely count on some short period yet before there is danger of thesituation becoming acute.&quot; In a further speech to the Canadian Legion at ottawa on the following day, General McNaughton continued to develop thistheme. Dealing in particular with the Home Defence Army, he confessed that many of the men had been able to obtain remuneration in civilian employment&quot; on a scale which is quite fantastic,&quot; but he indicated that he had issuedinstructions that this practice was to cease and that any men fit for militaryduty who had been employed on civilian tasks would be recalled at the earliest moment. General McNaughton admitted that the Home Defence Army hadbeen the cause of trouble in the country but he said that he had a positive proposalto correct &quot; abuses and unfortunate procedures and attitudes which seemed tohave developed or crept in.&quot; The Home Defence Army would now be trainedas soldiers; they would be given training on the same basis as that given thetroops in Britain. General McNaughton said that he had given these men a newdeal and he hoped that they would volunteer for overseas service. According tothe press reports, the meeting was a noisy one., and General McNaughton wasfrequently heckled by members of the Canadian Legion who demanded compul-sory overseas service.5. Finally, the Prime Minister himself, after a silence of six days,addressed the nation in a broadcast on the evening of the 8th November.He began his broadcast by revealing the present figures of the CanadianArmed Forces; this showed that the total strength of the Army was atpresent over 455,000 men, of whom about 390,000 were volunteers. Thepresent strength of the Flome Defence Army was about 68,000; of thesesome 9,000 were on extended leave. Of the remainder only about 42,000 were considered suitable material for infantry reinforcements and only some 16,000of these men were trained as infantry. Mr. King reached, finally, the somewhatastonishing conclusion that only 8,000 men in the Home Defence Army were sufficiently trained so that they could be ready for combat at an early date. TheGovernment would not contemplate the demobilisation of any of these mensince &apos;&apos; they will continue to be a potential ultimate reserve of reinforcementswhose compulsory employment in any theatre may, in the light of developingcircumstances, have to be reconsidered &quot; a significant passage. Mr. King alsorevealed that there had been a wastage of no less than 33,000 men dischargedfor various reasons in the Home Defence Army. Incidentally, he also indicated that of the 60,000 draftees in Canada, not more than 23,000 came from theProvince of Quebec and not more than 25,000 were French-speaking. Dealingwith the question whether there was adequate reserve of reinforcements for theArmy, the Prime Minister said that the problem was to find the means of speedingup the.flow of fully-trained infantry reinforcements to meet, not an actualshortage of reinforcements now, but a possible shortage in the next few months.Mr. Mackenzie King announced that Colonel Ralston had considered that hehad no alternative but to recommend that draftees should be sent overseas as
reinforcements. Acceptance of this recommendation would have required agree-ment by the Government that no alternative existed. But the Government werenot satisfied that this was so. &quot;Everyone who is honest with himself&quot; said the Prime Minister &apos;&apos; knows that there would be genuine difficulties in sub-stituting conscription for the voluntary system and they might be very grave.&quot;Moreover, compulsory overseas service was not in keeping with the policy of keeping the Army overseas 100 per cent, voluntary if possible. The voluntary system had not broken down, but at the moment it was subject to an added strain.The Prime Minister observed also that conscripted men would be received withoutenthusiasm by the volunteers they were sent overseas to join. Mr. King declaredthat, to increase the flow of infantry reinforcements for the Army, the Governmenthad therefore decided to intensify their effort to encourage voluntary enlistment,and he ended with an appeal to the draftees to volunteer for overseas serviceand to the people of Canada to co-operate and to avoid partisan controversy.6. Other incidents connected with this situation have been the retirement of General Stuart, hitherto the Canadian Chief of Staff of Canadian MilitaryHeadquarters in London, and the stand made by the Canadian Legion who, inan interview with the Prime Minister, have demanded that conscription for overseas service shall be introduced forthwith. There has been&apos; little publicexcitement in the Province of Quebec over this issue, but the senior FrenchCanadian Minister in the Federal Government, M. St. Laurent, in an addressat Quebec, said that if the Federal Government had decided to senddraftees overseas &quot; the majority of the people in Quebec would have deemedthemselves deceived by their English-speaking compatriots &quot; and that &quot; it wouldhave been a disaster, something extremely serious for the Canadian nation.&quot;7. As might have been expected, the situation has given rise tounprecedented comment in the press; nearly all English-speaking papers haverun one, if not more, editorials on the subject daily since the beginning of the crisis. All the English-speaking papers recognise the gravity of the situation,and there is a general demand for full information. The attitude of the pressfollows generally though not entirely along expected Party lines. the progressive Conservative opposition has bitterly attacked the government attitude; for example, the Winnipeg Tribune refers to &quot; McNaughton&apos;s retreat &quot; ;.the Vancouver Daily Province accuses the Government of evasion and cowardice;the Globe and Mail regards General McNaughton&apos;s appointment as &quot; a terrificshock,&quot; and the Montreal Gazette has had a scathing article on the Governmentevery day for nearly a fortnight. The Liberal papers continue to support theGovernment, but it is noteworthy that, while they all extend a warm welcome to General McNaughton, and, in varying measure, praise the Government forits wise decision, many of them are prepared for compulsory overseas serviceif necessary. For example, the Winnipeg Free Press insists that reinforcementsmust be sent, and that there must be no stop-gap, temporary solution. Commentin the French-Canadian press has been on a noticeably lower scale, and their general attitude seems to be that they cannot understand what all the botheris about. But naturally they sympathise with the Governments decision, andgreet General McNaughton&apos;s appointment with acclamation.8. There are certain noteworthy features about the episode. The first point is that General McNaughton&apos;s appointment may prove to be a master stroke ofthe Prime Ministers political genius. It is doubtful whether any other mancould have been entrusted to carry out the Governments policy without rousinga violent storm. General McNaughton enjoys, however, in spite of the circum-stances attending his retirement from his Army Command, an enormousreputation in Canada, and is popular in all circles. He is admired by the English-speaking population as the creator of the Canadian Army, and by the French-speaking, population as (now) a Roman Catholic, and as the defender of the voluntary system. He is, moreover, said to be immensely popular with the troops.The second remarkable feature is that Colonel Ralston&apos;s letter of resignation has never been published, although he indicated to the Press that he expected thePrime Minister to publish it, together with other relevant correspondence : andhe himself has so far maintained a stony silence on the differences which causedhim to leave the Government. (Incidentally, in rather an astonishing revelationduring his broadcast, Mr. Mackenzie King said that, even before Colonel Ralston&apos;resignation had taken place, he felt it to be his duty to seek the most expert advice available, and accordingly consulted General McNaughton.) The thirdremarkable feature is that, although there is undoubtedly intense public feelingf28788] . , b 2
in the English-speaking provinces on this issue, and people are impatient-not tosay exasperated-at the Prime Ministers handling of the issue, the ProgressiveConservatives have largely failed to draw any advantage from the situation.With an election in the offing, it might have been thought that here was an issueon which the Opposition would seek to rally the country behind them. but mr. Bracken has contented himself with issuing belated and laborious statements,and no other prominent Progressive Conservative has spoken since the crisisbegan.9. There can be little doubt that English-speaking Canadians as a whole are deeply stirred and seriously concerned at the issues involved. Unless theyare satisfied that reinforcements for the Army overseas are forthcoming, and inadequate numbers, public opinion may well assert, itself. On the other hand, noleadership has so far been shown by the Opposition, and it is to be rememberedthat Parliament is not due to meet again until the end of January.10. On the bare statistical aspect of reinforcement, apart from the political implications of the question, it seems genuinely doubtful whether conscriptioncould yield at any early date any more men than the present system. To intro-duce conscription at all, moreover, Parliament must meet: and one could not exclude the possibility of a Government defeat, with a consequent dissolution andGeneral Election. How soon, one may well ask oneself, if, after all thesevicissitudes and delays, conscription were ultimately adopted, would any of the products of that policy find themselves at the fighting fronts \ It has to beremembered that the undertaking that there should be no conscription for overseas service was the basic understanding which brought French Canada into the war at the outset. For the previous quarter century at least political parties have viedwith one another in pandering to Quebec&apos;s attitude on this question; and, ifthings have come to their present anxious and melancholy pitch, it is hard tosee that any one party is less to blame than any other.11. These are crucial days for Canada, and much will depend on thearrangements which the Government, having chosen their course, are able tomake to ensure that adequate reinforcements-are forthcoming by it. If theseare forthcoming and the Canadian Army is upheld, Mr. King may have averteda serious crisis and may have been able to maintain Canadian national unity.But only events of the next few weeks will show how far this claim can justlybe made.12. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the United Kingdom high commissioners in the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Unionof South Africa and also to the United Kingdom Ambassador at Washington.I have, &amp;c.PATRICK DUFF,Acting High Commissioner.P.S. Since the above was drafted, Colonel Ralston has issued a statement onthe reinforcement situation referring to the Prime Ministers broadcast. Thestatement said that the Prime Ministers wording might &quot; leave the impression that while the problem was &apos; immediate &apos; the actual sending of reinforcementscould be delayed for some time. That was not my report.&quot; Referring to the reference &quot;in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s broadcast to there being &quot; no actual shortageof reinforcements now,&quot; Colonel Ralston said that during his visit overseas he found that the reinforcement pools had been so depleted as not to ensure the prompt replacement of casualties; there were not infantry reinforcements avail-able. Quoting the Prime Ministers reference to the &quot;possible shortage.in thenext few months,&quot; Colonel Ralston said the forecast was that by the end ofDecember a considerable aggregate shortage in infantry would have developed,and that for the following months the forecast was that the shortage wouldprogressively increase.Colonel Ralston said that in the ordinary course an untrained man enlistednow would not be ready for battle before next June; it appeared clear to him thatenough volunteer personnel could not be made available to meet the need. Analternative was to reduce commitments or to break up units. He could not,however, concur in this when trained N.R.M.A.men were available. He, therefore,had come to the conclusion that the only practicable relief for the urgent situation was to recommend drawing on the trained N.R.M.A. infantrv men. As regardsthe time factor, Colonel Ralston repeated that the Prime Minister&apos;s reference to
a possible shortage in the next few months &quot; might lead to the inference that he did not stress the urgency of action. &quot; That inference would be whollyincorrect,&apos;&apos; said Colonel Ralston.Colonel Ralston&apos;s statement concluded with a brief reference to his resignation &quot; since the Prime Minister has referred to the circumstances, but hasnot yet released the correspondence.&quot; Colonel Ralston&apos;s statement on this point was as follows : - &apos;&apos; The Prime Minister in his radio speech said, &apos; when I realised that unless Colonel Ralston&apos;s recommendation were accepted by the Cabinet, his resignation would follow : . . .&apos;On this point, it is quite true that I had stated that I would have to resign if my recommendation were not accepted. I had understood govern-ment policy to be that if there were need for reinforcements overseas andvolunteers were not available, N.R.M.A. personnel would be sent. This was what I had taken from the Prime Ministers speeches in 1942. It was ineffect what I, as Minister, had repeatedly said in the House since.In view of the conditions which I found overseas, some of which I have outlined, and after full consideration, I felt that I had no alternative but torecommend that N.R.M.A. personnel be sent overseas as reinforcements. I felt that this was necessary to fulfil our pledges to our fighting men.My recommendation was not accepted, nor could I get any assurance thatthe Government as a whole considered that the Prime Minister&apos;s speechescommitted the Government to this course.Under these conditions, and as requested by the Prime Minister, I atonce tendered my resignation as Minister of National Defence.&apos;&apos;P.
