THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 708,7th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.INDIA.RESIGNATION OF THE CHANCELLOR AND MEMBERS OF THESTANDING COMMITTEE OF THE CHAMBER OF PRINCES.1. I circulate for the information of my colleagues telegrams dated the4th December from the Crown Representative (Annexures 1 and 2) announcingand giving his first comments on the resignation of the Chancellor of the Princes&apos;Chamber (His Highness the Nawab of Bhopal), the Pro-Chancellor (His highness the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar) and nineteen members of the Standing Committeeof the Chamber on the eve of the session of the Chamber in Delhi.2; It appears that this unexpected and unfortunate development is claimed by the Chancellor to have been precipitated by disappointment at the tone ofthe formal reply sent on behalf of the Crown Representative to points raisedby a small deputation of Princes led by the Chancellor to meet Lord Wavell onthe 15th-16th September. I circulate (Annexure 3) the terms of this reply, ofwhich the text had been agreed between the Crown Representative and myself.It gives the Crown Representative^ considered answer on points orally raised with him at the meeting regarding the following matters : I. Joint Administrative Services for groups of States.II. Protection of the States against attacks from British India.III. Scheme of Attachment of States.IV. Industrial Policy.V. Courts of Arbitration.VI. Post-War Reconstruction.VII. Treaty Rights.The Princes&apos; representations on these matters were, after the meeting,elaborated in a document&apos; running to twenty-nine pages of print which, as the reply is generally self-explanatory, it is not necessary to circulate. With regardto point III (Scheme of Attachment), I would refer to my memorandum of the27th January, W.P. (44) 57, and with regard to point VII (Treaty Rights), tomy memoranda of the 4th September and the 22nd December, 1942 (W.P. (42) 420and 610) leading up to a letter addressed to the Pro-Chancellor of the Chamberon the 9th January, 1943, with Cabinet approval, of which the relevant extractis cited in the concluding paragraph of the recent letter to the Chancellor(Annexure 3).3. The Crown Representative states that the disappointment occasioned byhis reply is attributed mainly to his comments on Point V (Courts of Arbitration).This matter has not been before the Cabinet recently, but has a long history behind it. Certain Princes have rested dissatisfied with the conditions in which theyare entitled under a Resolution of 1920 (Annexure 4) to invoke settlement of theirdisputes with the Crown Representative on the advice of an arbitral tribunal.It is claimed that in a particular class of case relating to disputes on materialissues there should be access to a judicial tribunal as.of right instead of at theViceroy&apos;s discretion, and that the findings of the tribunal should be final andnot, as now, by way of advice only to the Crown Representative who retains his discretion to accept or modify the terms of the advice tendered. A brief summaryof the developments in this matter is given in Annexure 5 and explains the termsof paragraph 6 of the Crown Representative^ reply on the subject (Annexure 3).T28765] b
4. The Crown Representative has promised to keep me informed of further developments in this unfortunate episode. It is satisfactory that an assurancehas been given to him that the action of those Princes who have resigned their offices will not affect their determination to continue doing their utmost to helpin the prosecution of the war. As the Viceroy observes, the Princes in making an issue of the questions of their Treaty Rights and of compulsory arbitrationare on weak ground. The best guarantee of their fair treatment over disputedissues rests in the retention by the Crown Representative of discretion to decideclaims as he thinks fit, rather than on a literal interpretation of language usedin documents negotiated in the distant past. I feel sure we can rely on the crown representative^ ability to deal with any extravagant claims now advanced andto bring the Chancellor and those associated with him to reconsider their positionand resume their functions.L.

There has not been time yet to ascertain what exactly is behind this move, which I regard as very unwise step. I have, however, postponed sessionwhich was due to be held on 5th-6th December, and have replied to Chancellorthat I have noted action taken by signatories of enclosure to his letter and that Iam grateful for assurance contained in latter document that step which he andhis colleagues have chosen to take will not affect Princes&apos; determination tocontinue doing their utmost to help with the prosecution of the war.ANNEXURE II.Telegram from Viceroy, dated 4th December, 1944.2217-S.My telegram of to-day. Resignation of Chancellor, Pro-Chancellor, and members present in Delhi oi Standing Committee of Chamber of Princes.2. Following is more detailed story : Meeting of Chamber was fixed for5th and 6th December. In November I was informed that Chancellor would press for inclusion in the order paper of resolution against transfer of States fromrelations with His Excellency the Crown Representative without their consent.I wrote to him on 26th November, saying I would prefer this matter not to beraised in public at present and hoped he would decide to drop it.3. On 2nd December Chancellor saw my Private Secretary and said hewould have difficulty with Standing Committee and might have to see me. Hewas concerned only about resolution referred to above and gave no indication ofany impending crisis. Later in the day he asked for an interview on the following morning.4. I saw him at 10-30 a.m. on 3rd December. He had then received reply(as amended by you) to points raised by September deputation, which, he said,was most disappointing. On original question of Resolution, I said I was stillagainst its inclusion, as I did not think it would do the Princes any good to havethe matter of their treaty rights discussed in public, but would agree to it ifStanding Committee insisted. The Chancellor said he was meeting the StandingCommittee immediately and might wish to consult me again.5. He returned at 2-30 p.m. and told me that members of StandingCommittee present in Delhi had decided to resign because the reply to points raised by the deputation was unsatisfactory. He stressed particularly theirdisappointment at our decision about courts of arbitration. He did not suggestthat he and the Pro-Chancellor intended to resign their offices.    I said I
1 Osympathised with him in his difficulties and would await -formal resignations.Intention was clearly to apply pressure, and Chancellor probably expected meto ask Standing Committee to see me, which I did not think it proper to do.6. Later on evening of the 3rd December I received a letter from the Chancellorforwarding documents signed by himself, pro-Chancellor and nineteen membersof the Standing Committee present in Delhi resigning both offices and member-ship of the Standing Committee. Members were Hoikar, Gwalior, Patiala,Rampur, Jaipur, Kotah, Bikaner, Dholpur, Dungarpur, Dewas. Faridkhot,Tehri Garhwal, Kurwai, Bilaspur, Vadia, Maihar, Korea, Akalkot, Seraikela.7. Constitutional position is as follows : There is no question of myaccepting the resignations as appointments are not made by me. I can only note that the Chancellor and pro-Chancellor have resigned their offices and that theStanding Committee has ceased to function, though some who have signed the resignation paper still continue by the constitution to be members. Meeting ofChamber is impossible without the Chancellor to conduct business, and there mustbe quorum of thirty.8. I cannot understand what is behind this move. Reply to deputation^points contained nothing new. -Wylie saw the Chancellor this morning on my instructions. Chancellor agreed that meeting of Chamber must be postponed andthat we might not get quorum. Questioned by Wylie, Chancellor said Princeshad been driven to desperation and thought that our comments on courts ofarbitration and treaty position meant that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to &quot; throw them to the wolves.&quot; He said they had acted against his advice.  He also agreed that they had no grounds for their excitement.9. Nationalist press and enemy propaganda will obviously exploit thesituation. Princes may refuse to serve on National Defence Council, and make difficulties with their Residents. On the other hand, their position both on courts of arbitration and on treaty rights is weak, and the larger States may welcome the temporary eclipse of the Chamber. Press is being informed that theChamber meeting is postponed. In guidance we shall disclose further facts, but no more than we must.   Our line will depend on extent of leakage from Princes.10. I will keep you informed of developments. Chancellor has behavedbadly. He must have known what was in the wind but gave me no warning of intention of Standing Committee to cause this crisis on the eve of session whenPrinces were actually assembled. Six of them, including the Chancellor, arestaying in the Viceroy&apos;s House and we have large party to-morrow which all the princes were attending.   It will be interesting to see developments.ANNEXURE III.Letter from His Excellency the Crown Representative to the Chancellorof the Chamber of Princes, dated 3rd December, 1944.Political Department, Neiv Delhi,My dear Nawab Sahib, 3rd December, 1944.I am desired to refer to your letter of the 13th October to Sir FrancisWylie and to convey the Crown Representative^ observations on the various matters discussed by the deputation of Princes, led by Your Highness, which met His Excellency on the 15th and 16th of September last.2. The Crown Representative is glad to observe that the Princes agree Joint Services,generally that the smaller Indian States, which cannot by themselvesmaintain an efficient standard of administration, should co-operate withsome other State or States to secure this essential end. His Excellencynotes and concurs in the deputation^ view that in inviting small states to co-operate with their neighbours in order to secure improvement intheir administrative arrangements there should be no suggestion that all such States are grossly misgoverned. Cases of gross mi $government, as youcorrectly point out, fall to be dealt with by the Crown Representative inaccordance with a separate and well-established procedure. The crown representative is interested to know that the Standing Committee of theChamber of Princes has set up a Committee, under the chairmanship of HisHighness the Maharaja of Bikaner, to define the minimum standards of efficient administration which the smaller States might normally be expected tomaintain. While His Excellency doubts whether it is, in fact, possible to devise a formula which will cover the very diverse conditions obtaining in the Indian[28765] ;. B 2   -
States or embrace the many different prerequisites which go to the formation ofan efficient administration,&quot; I am to say that the findings of this Committee willbe awaited with interest. The three specific suggestions and one additionalsuggestion which the deputation put forward for improving the existing procedure in grouped areas may now be summarised : (a) that Boards of Control for the working of Joint Services should consistonly of Rulers representing full powered States and, should not contain representatives of States under minority or other manage-ment or representatives of States where residuary powers of juris-diction vest in the Crown Representative,(b) that Joint Advisers, etc., should not deal with Political Officers overthe heads of State administrations or Boards of Control,(c) that the working of the various schemes of Joint Services which maybe in operation at any given time should be subjected to periodicalreview by a small Committee consisting of the Chancellor, a fewRulers and the Political Adviser,(d) that the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Princes be given anopportunity to prepare a scheme of minimum standards for efficient administration and to suggest alternative ways of meeting the difficultypresented by the existence of petty Indian States which cannot fromtheir own resources conform to such standards; that thereafter fora period of two years the States may be allowed to work out a schemeof their own without interference from Political Officers, theposition to be reviewed after the expiry of the period mentioned.The Crown representative realises that the association of representativesof States under management (for whatever reason) with Boards of Control hasnot in all cases met with the approval of Rulers of full powered States. Never-theless, the alternative that these States should be required to contribute tothe cost of Joint Advisers, &amp;c, without having a say in their appointment andcontrol would seem to go against the whole principle underlying theco-operative plan. It must be realised, the Crown Representative thinks, thatminority and other forms of management do not last indefinitely and it wouldseem on principle to be unfair that because a State happened to be underminority management as all States may be from time to time it should be deprived of its rights to share in the deliberations of the Board of Control. Noris it sufficient to suggest that, if States under management do not. like anarrangement whereby they should contribute to the cost of Joint Advisers, &amp;c,without having a voice in their appointment and control, they should look else-where. For the truth is that many Indian States are so small that there is noother alternative open to them except to join forces with the nearest group, while on the other hand, if the benefits of the co-operative grouping plan are to berealised in the necessary degree, the groups themselves must be as large aspossible. His Excellency is therefore reluctantly compelled to disagree with thedeputation^ suggestion, but he undertakes to keep all Boards of Control, whereStates under management are represented, under close observation with a viewto ascertaining whether the objections which the deputation see in the existing arrangements are so serious that some alternative plan must be isought for meeting the difficulty.His Excellency realises that once the co-operative grouping expedient hasbeen fully developed it would perhaps be inconsistent with the principle ofco-operation for Joint Advisers, &amp;c., to deal with Political Officers except throughthe medium of the group Board of Control. The experiment of co-operativegrouping is, however, still at a tentative stage only, it has been devised by theCrown Representative as a possible solution of a very embarrassing problem, andHis Excellency trusts that you will not at this stage press your objection to JointAdvisers on occasion having access to the Political Agent concerned independently of the Board of Control. I am to assure Your Highness that Political officers are fully seized of the necessity of keeping their interference with co-operativegrouping arrangements restricted to the absolute minimum, but until the expedienthas established itself firmly may be on somewhat different lines in different areas occasional intervention on the part of Political Officers with the purposeof co-ordinating and stimulating co-operative grouping schemes is unavoidable.In this connection I am to say that the Crown Representative considers that yoursuggestion that individual States should report annually or six monthly to theBoard of Control, showing the degree to which they have been able during thisperiod to accept the advice of Joint Officers, is an excellent one and might be -implemented straightaway.
The Crown Representative gladly accepts your suggestion that the workingof the various schemes of joint services and the differences, if any, relating theretomay be subjected to periodical review by a small Committee consisting of theChancellor, a few Rulers and the Political Adviser. I am to suggest that thisproposal be taken up in the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Princes andthe details explored. His Excellency will watch the developments of thisproposal with interest and will keep himself in close touch with the deliberationsof this small Committee.His Excellency has taken note of the objection mentioned by His highness the Raja of Bilaspur that the employment by a number of States of a joint HighCourt is an invasion of the sovereignty of the contributing States. His Excellencydoes not accept this view. He considers, on the contrary, that a joint HighCourt, in the sense in which he understands the term, becomes the moment itenters the borders of a contributing State the High Court of that State derivingits right to administer the laws of the State from the Ruler and from no othersource.His Excellency will always be glad to receive suggestions from the Chamberof Princes or from individual Princes designed to improve co-operative groupingprocedure as the latter is at present organised. He cannot, however, agree thatthe existing experiments, which have been initiated after much thought andlabour on the part of all concerned, should be suspended while the States workout an alternative scheme of their own. This question of joint co-operativeeffort on the part of small States to improve their- sometimes painfully inade-quate administrative arrangements has been the subject of discussion for manyyears past. The plans now put in motion fall far short of what will be necessary if the petty class of Indian States are ever to achieve a reasonably efficientstandard of administration. This being the case His Excellency would be most reluctant to put the clock back and surrender such progress as has been achieved in pursuit of an alternative plan which, when it has been worked out, cannotperhaps in the nature of things differ very greatly from the plans which havebeen evolved and are now under trial in various parts of the country. I am to repeat, however, that these plans are not to be regarded as rigid. They aretentative and subject to revision and readjustment as further experience of theproblem is secured. In these tentative enquiries and experiments His Excellencyhopes that he will have the support, as he will always welcome the advice, of all those who are anxious to work for the enhancement of the reputation of theIndian States as a whole.3. The existing position in this matter is set forth in some detail in the correspondence ending with Sir Kenneth Fitze&apos;s letter No. F. 315-P (S) /42 datedthe 30th October, 1942, to Your Highness&apos; predecessor in the office of Chancellor.His Excellency has given his best consideration to the deputation^ proposal that&apos;&apos; early discussions be initiated between representatives of the Crown Depart-ment and of the States to which legal advisers of the Government of India maybe invited, with the object of making effective the safeguards provided in theGovernment of India Act and the existing provisions of the law on the subject.&quot;The difficulties in the way of improving on the present legal position are, however,real and His Excellency doubts&apos; whether anything would in fact be gained by holding discussions of the kind contemplated at the present time. I am to assureYour Highness however that this aspect of the Crown&apos;s relations with the indian states will continue to receive His Excellency&apos;s watchful attention and that hewill at all times use his best endeavours to protect the Rulers of Indian Stateswhether from baseless agitations against individual States directed from british india or from scurrilous attacks in the British Indian Press. Actually HisExcellency is inclined to think that with the now rising standard of administra-tion in the Indian States occasions for such attacks on the Princes and on their governments may with the passage of time decrease. On their side His Excellencyis confident that the Princes will, by wise government in their own areas, con-tribute to this most desirable result.4. His Excellency has read the summary of the deputation^ representationsabout the Attachment Scheme with much care. In the first place he desires meto remind Your Highness that the problem presented by the existence of a largenumber of petty Indian States is both complex and pressing. The crown representative has during the last years been so impressed with the necessity in the interests of all the Indian States-of finding a solution for this problemthat he is inclined to regard this subject as perhaps the most important of the issues now confronting the British Crown in its relations with the Indian States.
That a complete or permanent solution of the problem will be found either throughthe co-operative grouping expedient or by the process of attachment cannot yet be categorically affirmed, but so serious are the consequences of a failure to find asatisfactory solution that His Excellency looks with confidence to the Princes for support and advice in his efforts to find such a solution. The deputation led by your Highness made the following principal requests : (a) that the Instruments of Attachment be revised in consultation withtheTepresentatives of attaching and attached States,(&amp;) that no further extension of the scheme of attachment be permitted. )As regards the first of these requests I am to say that the Crown Representativehas under his consideration certain proposals affecting the text of the instruments of Attachment and that as soon as His Excellency has reached a definite conclu-sion on these proposals their purport will, if necessary, be communicated to theStates concerned both attaching and attached. As to the second request, asYour Highness is aware, the scope of the India (Attachment of States) Act isspecifically restricted to certain States in the Western India and Gujarat StatesAgencies. I am to inform Your Highness that there is no intention of promotinglegislation to admit of its application in other Agencies.5. The question of the industrial policy of the Central Government as it affects the Indian States has since been the subject of discussion between repre-sentatives of the States and of the Central Government. His Excellency truststhat as a result of these discussions the doubts to which the deputation gaveexpression will be resolved and that the Indian States will be enabled to play their full part in the post-war development of industrial and other activities in thecountry:6. The specific suggestions which the deputation had to offer on this subjectwere &quot; (a) that there should be systematic recourse to the procedure embodied inthe Resolution of 1920 when dealing with dynastic rights and with questions of gross misrule, and(b) that where the issues are justiciable or relate to fiscal, economic or financial matters, including the- interpretation of Treaties and Agree-ments, recourse should be had as of right to a Court of Arbitration.&quot;His Excellency desires me to say that he has considered both these suggestionswith the care which they deserve, but that he is unable to accept them. Thissubject has been frequently discussed in the past and for various reasons, into which it is not necessary to enter here, it has always been thought inadvisable to limit the discretion which vests in the Crown Representative under the 1920Resolution as the text of this Resolution stands at the present time. In the pre-vailing uncertainty constitutional and otherwise His Excellency is notprepared to depart from this view, and he regrets that in this particular matterit is not possible for him to accede to the wishes of the deputation.Post-war 7.   The problem of co-ordinating post-war development objectives as betweenReconstruction ^e Qentral Government and the Indian States has also since been the subject ofdiscussion between your representatives and those of the Central Government.In the circumstances and pending the conclusion of these discussions it is notpossible for the Crown Representative to comment in any profitable way on the suggestions made by the deputation. I am to assure you, however, that the crown representative recognises this problem as one of very real importance and thatit is receiving--and will continue to receive his close personal attention.Treaty Rights. 8.   In connection with Treaty Rights the deputation offered the suggestionthat &apos;&apos; some effective machinery should be set up to ensure that Treaty Rightsshall not be overridden.&quot; For this purpose the Princes requested His Excellencyto set up some sort of machinery whereby the views of Princes through a fewrepresentatives selected, by His Excellency including the Chancellor -are placed before him before His Excellency decided to take formal action in the exerciseof the powers of the Crown, vis-a-vis the States-particularly in such matters asdirectly affect the Princes or where policies affecting the States in general are proposed to be laid down.&quot;Lacking any details beyond its proposed composition His Excellency is unable )to form any clear idea of the matters which would be discussed with the proposed&quot; permanent committee.&quot;   On receipt of further details, however, His Excellencywill give this proposal his careful consideration.   In the meantime I am to statethat there has been no change in the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towardsIndustrialPolicy.Courts ofArbitration.
the Indian Princes since Sir Kenneth Fitze wrote in his letter No. F. 376-P/42dated the 4th January, 1943, to the Pro-Chancellor of the time that &quot; theIndian Princes may rest assured, that the fulfilment of the fundamental obligationsarising out of their Treaties and Sanads remains an integral part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ policy ...&quot; I should of course add, what Your Highnessalready well knows, that the interpretation of the text of relevant Treaties has long been affected by usage and sufferance and has in the nature of things to be related to the necessities of changing times. The concern of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and of the Crown Representative for the status and interests of theIndian Princes remains, however, unchanged and as deep as ever and in HisExcellency&apos;s view it is in this fact that the Princes will find their best safeguard.Yours very sincerely,(Signed) C. L. GRIFFIN,Political Secretary.ANNEXURE IV.Government of India (Foreign and Political Department). resolution no. 427-R., dated 29th October, 1920 (as amended by resolution no. 224-P., dated 3rd May, 1926).The Government of India have had under consideration the question ofgiving effect to the recommendations contained in paragraph 308 of the Reporton Indian Constitutional Reforms, and are pleased to prescribe the following procedure for dealing with cases of the nature therein referred to : -When a dispute arises between the Government of India or a LocalGovernment, and any Indian State, or between two or more Indian States, or where any State is dissatisfied with the ruling or advice of the Government ofIndia or of its local representatives, and it appears that for the proper deter-mination of the case independent advice is desirable, the Governor-General willat his descretion appoint a Court of Arbitration to enquire into the case. Incases where a Darbar is dissatisfied with the ruling or advice of the Governmentof India or of its local representative, no request for the appointment of a Courtof Arbitration under this Resolution will be considered unless made within oneyear of the date on which the Darbar concerned is informed of the ruling orreceived the advice in question, provided that the Governor-General may, at his discretion, extend the said period.The composition of the Court will be determined in each case by the Governor-General, but it will ordinarily -include (a) a judicial officer not lower in rank than a Judge of a Chartered HighCourt of Judicature in British India;(b) one nominee of each of the parties concerned.On the appointment of the Court, the Governor-General will convey to theCourt an order of reference stating the matter referred for enquiry.Each party will be entitled to represent its case to the Court by Counselor otherwise.The Court, after hearing the parties, will make their recommendations tothe Governor-General in a judgment setting forth the subject under enquiry in accordance with the terms of the order of reference and their recommendation as to the decision to be arrived at, and enclosing a copy of the proceedings of theCourt and the documents before the Court.The Court will also recommend in every case by whom and in what proportionsthe costs of the proceedings, including the appropriate part of the salary of thejudicial officer employed (but not including the remuneration of the nomineesunder sub-clause (&amp;), which will be borne by the respective parties) should bepaid, and for this purpose will have power to tax the^costs of any party, and todetermine all questions relating thereto.The Governor-General, after consideration of the recommendations contained in the judgment of the Court, will give his decision upon the case(   generally and announce it to the parties.Either party, if dissatisfied with the decision of the Governor-General,will have such right of appeal to the Secretary of State as is provided for in therales for the submission of petitions and memorials which are to be addressed toHis Majesty the King-Emperor of India and the Secretary of State for India.
Where the Governor-General has at his discretion refused to appoint aCourt of Arbitration, he will inform the party or parties of his reasons forrefusal, who will have such right of appeal to the Secretary of State as isprovided for in the rules for the submission of petitions and memorials to HisMajesty the King-Emperor and&apos;Secretary of State.ANNEXURE V.    &apos;Summary of Developments regarding Settlement by Arbitration.An indirect consequence of the legal theory of paramountcy has been thedemand that disputes now determined by the arbitrary action of the ParamountPower should, if justiciable, be settled by arbitration (although it should benoted that the authors of the legal opinion themselves held that the ParamountPower was under no legal obligation to provide machinery for independentadjudication). The method of settling disputes with and between the States by arbitration is, of course, not unknown. An ad hoc tribunal successfullydetermined by agreement between Madras and Mysore their long-standingdispute as regards the Cauvery Waters. On the other hand, recourse to this method of settlement had been unusual. Thus the authors of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report were impressed with the special advantage of submittingcertain classes of disputes to an arbitral tribunal for investigation as a normalpreliminary to the final decision of the Paramount Power, and as a result oftheir recommendations specific machinery was devised for this purpose.The procedure approved so long ago as 1920 has in fact seldom been utilised,though this appears mainly to have been due to the reluctance of States to be bound by it in their disputes with one another. As a result of the evidencebrought to light in the Butler Committee&apos;s enquiry, it was strongly felt that thecharge made by certain Princes against Government of being party and judge in its own suit should if possible be disposed of in the class of case in which thedispute turned upon a material issue (such as land, water or money) by adopting the definite policy of referring such cases; subject, of course, to the Viceroy&apos;sdiscretion, for the advice of an ad hoc arbitral tribunal before decision. It was realised that the bulk of cases of this kind would be disputes between State and state or a State and a Province, not between a State and the Paramount Power.Thus, the Viceroy was informed that some definite advance on the arbitralprocedure provided for under the Montagu-Chelmsford Report might be offered,especially in material issues, always subject to a discretion remaining with aParamount Power to refuse a judicial settlement when, in the opinion of theViceroy, the essential and ultimate responsibilities of the Paramount Power are involved. Recourse has been had to this procedure for the settlement of two important disputes between a State and the Paramount Power. It was after hearing and advice by Lord Dunedin in 1934 that the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar&apos;claim to sea customs on goods entering British India after having been importedat Bedi was compromised. Again, a tribunal gave advice in 1934 which caused the Government of India to reject the claim of Indore to refund of the proceedscollected in the State of a terminal tax imposed in war time on goods carried by rail. There is reason to think that the States would stipulate for the reference of all disputes about their treaty rights to a special court, were their protection to cease to be a special responsibility of the Governor-General.
