TOP secret.P. (44) 705Afth December, 194496 OThe  circulation  of this   paper  has been strictly   limited.    It   is  issued   for   theJersonal use of copy No. 3 war CABINETARMY MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS, JANUARY TO JUNE, 1945MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. I circulate herewith a Review of Army Manpower for the period up to the end ofJune, 1945. As a basis of calculation this has been taken as the date by which the german war will end, and before which re-deployment for the war against Japan will not begin.2. The delayed surrender of Germany and the plan for major operations in Burma in1945 have made more difficult the Army manpower position, already serious enough as theresult of previous cuts in Army demands.3. The necessity for the maintenance of the recently introduced leave scheme and for thefurther shortening (if that be possible) of the average period of service abroad will make theposition critical unless major additions to the Army intake are approved.4. If there is to be a full appreciation of these difficulties, the review itself must be studied.   The main points which emerge from it are: (a) I hope by internal re-organization to hold the Army in the first six months of1945 at the level reached by the end of this year (but see the qualificationin (d) below).(6) I cannot hope to effect a rapid&apos; and efficient re-deployment of our forces against japan at the end of June unless I am given (i) 10,000 basically trained men, Grade I, fit for Infantry, in the courseof the next few months. This can only come from the other services ;(ii) an intake of 25,000 men during the first six months of 1945.(c) To maintain the agreed scale of activity in the second six months of 1945 I musthave for the ordinary purposes of replacingNormal wastage,Casualties,Class B releases,1 . Leave,106,500 men during the first six months of 1945.(d) The provision of the numbers referred to in (b) and (c) will not enable me toreduce the average length of service abroad beyond the periods I stated tothe House on 26th September. To achieve this I must have in addition60,000 basically trained men and a further new intake of 50,000.5. The most difficult problem is the provision of the 60,000 basically trained menreferred to in 4 (d) above.The alternatives before the Cabinet are :- (a) to transfer the 60,000 men to the Army from other Services,(b) to start at an early date cutting down still further the number of formations inall theatres,(c) to incur the severe criticism which will arise if steps are not taken to reduce the tour of service.Printed for the War Cabinet, Decemberj 1944
6. I desire to impress upon my colleagues the fact that this question of the overseastour is of the most vital importance. Even as matters stand at present there is a growingvolume of criticism directed against the War Office and the Government at the abnormallylong period which thousands of men have to serve abroad. The fact that it is possible forthe Royal Air Force and to a less degree for the Royal Navy to relieve their foreign service personnel more frequently makes it even more difficult to meet this uninformed criticism. Ifthe situation is serious now it can only be much worse v/hen the war with Germany is overand when greatly increased numbers of British troops are sent to the Far East; andincidentally in the middle of a general election. A great deal is being done and has beendone to make service in that theatre as tolerable as is humanly possible, but I contemplatewith great misgiving a situation in which, notwithstanding the cessation of hostilities inEurope,we may be compelled to admit that the average tour of foreign service so far from having been diminished has been increased.I have no doubt that it would be unacceptable to adopt the alternative of diminishingour effort on the European front, and I do not advocate that course. Nor do I feel justifiedat this moment in advising that current operations in Burma should be interfered with andthe DRACULA operation further delayed, a policy which would enable us to withdrawPYTHON men from the Far Eastern theatre without immediate replacement, but I am anxious not to obscure the undoubted fact that in the absence of these unacceptable alter-natives we are likely to be faced with a public outcry which may well spread to the Serviceitself. It is for these reasons that I urge with all the emphasis that I can command that theintakes which I have recommended should in some way be forthcoming.7. I ask the War Cabinet (a) to approve (i) an early transfer of 10,000 Grade I men with full basic training from theother Services,(ii) an allocation from January to June, 1945, of 181,500 new men from civil life,(hi) the demands for the Women&apos;s Services and for civilians as set out in theAnnexure ;(b) to decide whether 60,000 more basically trained men should be withdrawn fromany source so as to start from 1 January, 1945, a scheme for reducing the tour abroad to three and two-thirds years for India, four years for other theatres.P. J- G.The War Office,2nd December, 1944.
ANNEXREVIEW OF ARMY MANPOWER, NOVEMBER, 1944(With particular reference to the intakes required in the first six months of 1945)introduction. In assessing the Army intakes required during the first six months of 1945 we have assumed, for planning purposes, that the war with Germany will go on until the end ofJune, 1945 ; and that no re-deployment for the war against Japan will take place before theGerman War ends. On this assumption, intakes received from civil life during the first halfof 1945 can contribute nothing to the German War, because they will not be trained in time.Intakes in the first six months only become effective in the second half of 1945.2. The period which governs the intakes needed (the last six months of 1945) will be oneof transition, marked by four main factors : (a) The Armies in Europe will be  passing  from  a  stage of open hostilities-to an occupational role ;this we can see as a gradual process during which there may be guerilla fighting.(b) Re-deployment to the Far East will be taking place, necessitating a considerableexchange of men within units to ensure that only those eligible are sent;(c) The gradual reduction in the size of the Army, as a result of the release scheme,will begin;we estimate that some 250,000 men will have returned to civil life by the end of the year.(d) Very large numbers of men will be due for relief after long service abroad.3. The relief of men with long service abroad will become during 1945 the mostimportant individual factor influencing the manpower situation in the Army. For thisreason, and because it reacts somewhat differently on the position in the first half of the year from that in the second half, it is dealt with&apos; in a special section of this Memorandum, whichis sub-divided as follows : Part    I Assessment of the position by the end of June, 1945.Part II Assessment of the position, July to December, 1945.Part III Relief of men with long service overseas (PYTHON).Part IV Women&apos;s Services and Civilians and Summary of Requirements.PART I-ASSESSMENT OF THE POSITION BY THE END OF JUNE, 19454. During the last half of 1944 the Army will have run down in strength by two andtwo-thirds divisions of infantry and three brigades of armour. This is two infantry brigadesmore than we had expected, and has been brought about by a higher rate of infantrycasualties in Italy and N.W. Europe than was forecast. In the Far East, however, ourestimate of the position has been borne out. &apos;5. For the first half of 1945 we estimated previously, in W.P. (44) 453, that we should beable to hold the Army at the level reached by the end of December, 1944, even if theGerman War continued until June. The position has been re-examined in the light of subsequent developments in all theatres, and initially on the basis that the present ruling tourof overseas service continues throughout the first half of 1945. The effect of shortening the tour is discussed separately in Part III.5. As in past Reviews, the situation is governed by the Infantry Arm, and in view ofour experience in 1944 we have had to raise our estimate of infantry casualrties above those used before. Measures are already in hand for improving the Infantry position in the first six months of 1945. They include a large programme for retraining as Infantry men ofother Arms, found in part from substantial cuts in Anti-Aircraft Command and in part fromthe reductions of formations during 1944. Despite these measures, we estimate that theremay still be an Infantry deficit at 30th June of some 9,000, sub-divided : Italy......       ......      6,000SEAC......       ......      3,000We consider, however, that the programme for retraining men from Anti-Aircraft Commandcould be extended, and that it may be possible thereby to avoid the deficit of 6,000 in Italy.The ruling factor will be the time available, and for this reason the reduction of a furtherdivision in Italy cannot be completely ruled out.7. Athough we have assumed that re-deployment for the Far East will not begin tillJuly, 1945, we must be prepared to start as soon as the German War ends. Immediate \vith-drawal of formations from Europe will necessarily be most difficult, and we are planning,therefore, to make up and despatch in the first place two divisions now engaged in a training(20224) a 2
role at home. For this our principal need will be some 15,000 Infantry, who should beavailable not later than June and preferably earlier. Towards this total we may hope tohave a small balance of not more than 5,000 from the extension of the retraining schemereferred to in paragraph 6, but we estimate that we shall need a special intake of at least10,000 to complete the 15,000. If these two divisions are to be ready to leave as soon as theGerman War ends, this intake.can only meet the requirement if it consists of a transfer ofbasically trained Grade I men from the other Services.CONCLUSIONS-PART I8. The position between the end of June, 1944, and the end of June, 1945, on the basisreferred to in italics in paragraph 5, may be summarised as follows : [a) By 31st December, 1944A loss of Two and two thirds Infantry divisions.Three brigades of armour.i.e. two Infantry brigades more than previously expected.(b) By 30th June, 1945(i) A possible loss of a further Infantry division.(ii) Inability to start immediate re-deployment for the Far East unless aspecial intake from the other Services of 10,000 basically trainedGrade I men is obtained.PART II.-ASSESSMENT OF POSITION, JULY TO DECEMBER, 19459. The basic factors, excluding PYTHON dealt with in Part III, which govern the size of intakes required in the first half of 1945, are (a) Normal wastage.(b) Estimated battle casualties.(c) Re-deployment.(d) Release to civil life Class A. We estimate that 250,000 men will be released in the period october to December, 1945.Class B. Assumed at not more than 10 per cent, of Class A.(e) Leave.NORMAL WASTAGE.10. An examination of the past nine months shows that normal wastage remains at,000 per month on the present strength of the Army. With a decline in gross strength ofthe Army due to release of some 250,000 during the period October to December, 1945, therewill be a proportionate reduction in monthly wastage. The wastage .to be covered istherefore July to September at 7,000 per month ...       ...       ...      21,060,  October to December at 6,500 per month       ...       ...      19,50040,500BATTLE CASUALTIES11. Forces in Europe. We must expect casualties if there is guerilla fighting duringthe. early months following the end of hostilities proper. The latest forecast for this showsthat we may expect the casualties to be amply covered by wounded returning to duty, andthat even in the Infantry there may be a margin. This will assist materially towardsproviding the pool of men needed for the process of resorting for the Far East and for settingthe Release Scheme in motion. Due allowance has been made for this in assessing the newmanpower required for re-deployment, discussed in paragraph 13 below.12. Forces in the Far East. In the Far East, however, the situation will be different.During the monsoon period, apart from battle casaulties, there will be a substantial wastagefrom malaria both among the troops actively engaged and those training in jungle warfare.In addition, the casualties in the assault operations immediately following the monsoon arelikely to be heavy. We estimate that the net replacements required during the six monthsJuly to December will amount to 23,000RE-DEPLO YMENT13. The re-deployment programme starting immediately the German War ends will involve the despatch of four British and three Indian Infantry divisions, one BritishAirborne division, together with large numbers of ancillary and base units.   Except for the
two leading British divisions referred to in paragraph 7, the whole of the remainder must come from Europe and the problem of their withdrawal will be greatly complicated by two important and conflicting factors ; (a) All these units taken from Europe, including the British element of the indian divisions, must be sorted before despatch to ensure that every man eligiblefor release is replaced by one eligible for the Far East; and this must bedone as expeditiously as possible. For every unit withdrawn from Europe we estimate that the resources of two will be needed to carry out the sortingprocess.   This must of necessity react on the efficiency of those not taken.(b) At the same time it will be necessary to avoid reducing unduly the strengthand efficiency of the units remaining in Europe, even for some time after theend of open hostilities; and the sorting process must necessarily causes considerable dislocation.A smooth and rapid re-deployment could thus only take place if there is a pool of manpowerimmediately available which will enable the sorting process to be carried out. Part will befound from the returning wounded referred to in paragraph 11; but we estimate that this must be increased by men from new intakes amounting to 25,000.RELEASES TO CIVIL LIFE14. Class A Normal The Army should, on the &quot; Age and Length of Service &quot; formula,return some* 1-3 million men and women to civil life within twelve months of the defeat ofGermany. For the reasons given above it is estimated that practically no releases will takeplace during the first three months after Germany&apos;s surrender. We have thereforeassumed (a) that the whole total of releases must be dealt with during a period of nine months;(b) that 250,000 men will leave the Army in the period October to December,1945, exclusive of Class B releases, which are dealt with in paragraph 15.These releases will, however, be balanced by a corresponding reduction in the size of theArmy, and no additional intake is asked for on this account.15. Class B- Specialist Tradesmen There is in addition Class B, comprising specialisttradesmen, required for industry and reconstruction, whose release is provided for distinct from Class A. They are to be replaced man for man by new intakes. But these will beuntrained, and the Army cannot afford to be short of qualified tradesmen while the replace-ments are being trained. It is essential that the reliefs should be provided early enough to undergo both general military and specialist training before such releases start. We have assumed that the numbers involved will be limited to 10 per cent, of Class A (250,000) ;and the intakes required on this account, starting in January, 1945, and spread over thefirst six months, amount to 25,000LEAVE16. The release of men to civil life and the exchange of men with long service overseasmight appear at first sight to justify the discontinuance of a leave scheme for overseastheatres. There will still, however, be some 148,000 men, with over two years&apos; service abroad,who will not be eligible for release or PYTHON. For this large number some provision forleave should be made. We cannot expect to give leave to all these men, but we considerthat the present small quota of 6,000 per month should be continued. The additional intakesneeded on this account, based on an average of three months&apos; absence, amount to 18,000CONCLUSIONS-PART II17. The new intakes of men from civil life needed between January and June, 1945,excluding the implications of relief of men with long service overseas dealt with in Part III,are summarised as follows Normal Wastage ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 40,500Casualties Far East ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 23,000Re-deployment ... ... ............ ... ... ... ... 25,000-Releases Class B ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 25,000Leave     ...       ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 18,000131.500(20224)* W.P.

PART III-RELIEF OF MEN WITH LONG SERVICE OVERSEAS (PYTHON)18. The problem presented during 1945 by relief of men with long service overseas differs from that in past years, both in size and importance, for two main reasons : (a) The numbers eligible for relief, even on the present ruling tours abroad, willgreatly increase particularly during the second half year.    This resultsdirectly from large numbers sent overseas between 1940 and 1942.(c) It is essential that, before releases to civil life start in October, the tour shouldbe&apos; reduced matexially below its present length.   This reduction would auto-matically increase still further the numbers to be relieved up to a total ofmore than 200,000 for the whole year.A note indicating the numbers involved is attached at Appendix &quot; A &quot;19. The present ruling periods are as follows : -India/SEAC ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   4 yearsOther theatres     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   4 years. 9 months and our target should be to reduce these during 1945 to India/SEAC ..................3 years 8 monthsOther theatres     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   4 years the additional numbers involved in such a reduction are, however, very large. To meetthe present ruling periods we are despatching reliefs at an average rate of some 6,000 a month,and this number would hold the tours at their present length for the first few months of 1945.Later in the year the numbers, even for the present tour, would rise. But to reach our targetwe should need to provide reliefs at an average rate throughout the whole 0/1943 of 19,000 ormore each month. We have examined the possibilities and repercussions of this separatelyfor each half year, as the situation differs for each.A. Effect in first half of 194520. If the tour is to be shortened, it is clearly desirable to spread the despatch of increased reliefs over the whole year, if only to avoid the administrative difficulties whichwould arise if a start were deferred till the German War ends. This delay would double the monthly quotas at the very time that shipping would be most difficult owing to redeployment.But while we estimate that we can maintain the present tour during the first half year withoutaffecting operations, this would not be the case if we attempted to relieve men at a rate ofsome 19,000 a month.To achieve the shorter tour, we should have to find additional reliefs beyond the numbersneeded for the present ruling periods, which, after allowing for the men returning to dutyduring the six months, would amount to 60,000. The alternative would be to bring menhome without relief.   The possible courses and the effect of each is as follows: (a) Reliefs, if sent, could be found within the Army only at the expense of forcesfighting in Europe. This would lead inevitably to the break up of divisionsat the climax of the German War, and the operational repercussions wouldbe most serious.(6) If NO reliefs are sent, the operational effect would fall on the theatres over-seas and particularly the Far East. Here, because the British manpower isspread over large numbers of Indian and African units, a much larger number of divisions would become unfit for operations.(c) The extra reliefs could be provided, without affecting operations, by a transfer to the Army of 60,000 basically trained men from the other Services in timeto become fully trained in an even flow throughout the first six months of1945.   These would be additional to the 10,000 referred to in paragraph 7.21. This is the bare minimum requirement of extra manpower which the Army needs ifa start on reducing the overseas tour is to be made at the beginning of 1945 and while theGerman War continues. It takes no account of the loss in the strength of units resultingfrom the despatch of men home before their reliefs arrive, and from the time that men areout of action while travelling and on leave. To prevent this loss a pool is needed, which wehave never been in a position to build up, and which we should not be able to create in thefirst half of 1945.,       B. Effect in second half of 194522. During the third quarter of 1945 we should need to continue the reliefs on the sames cale ; in the last three months of the year the numbers could be expected to drop with the start of releases, which will bring home a proportion of men who will not need relief. the decrease in numbers will, however, not be large since in India and the Middle East the size ofthe forces will be growing and not falling off, and all men released from the Army will needreplacement in these theatres.
23.. To reach the tour at which we are aiming we have shown that more than 19,000reliefs per month, would have to be despatched abroad throughout the whole of 1945- In thefirst half year we could only send these numbers if we were given 60,000 extra men from outside the Army. From July onwards we can count on drawing from the Armies inEurope, whose operations we have assumed will be over; and it might be expected that theywould provide a reservoir sufficient to cover the reliefs and also the pool needed to prevent a loss of strength in units. But for the same reasons as explained in paragraph 13 we do not expect to find from that source enough men eligible for the Far East even for re-deployment;and we have asked for 25,000 new intakes. To meet the PYTHON commitment in addition,we estimate that a further intake of new men would be needed amounting to : 50,00024. If these intakes of 60,000 and 50,000 are not obtained we must be prepared to face the inevitable consequences, political as well as military. Either we maintain our impact onthe enemy and fail to reduce the tour of service abroad, accepting the risk of a breakdown inthe morale of the Army and possible public criticism ; or we reduce the tour and face the operational repercussions, and the comments of our Allies. A middle course might be to putoff any idea of reducing the overseas tour till the German War is over. - To reach it in thelast half year without the extra men would, however, involve delay in re-deployment against japan, and probably the retention of men due for release in order to make available thoseeligible for the Far East. This compromise might be inevitable, but repercussions on morale and on the opinion of our own public and of our Allies would not be eliminated.CONCLUSIONS-PART III25. The position may be summarised as follows : (a) It is a matter of extreme importance that a material reduction of the tourabroad, if possible down to a maximum of 4 years, should be achieved in1945 and before releases to civil life begin. If this is to be attained, a startshould be made from the beginning of the year.(b) Unless the most serious consequences on the prosecution of the war, eitheragainst Germany or in the Far East, are accepted, this early start could onlybe made if the Army received a special intake from the other Services. Thiswould need to be basically trained and to come in early enough to become fully trained evenly over the first six months of 1945. The number required is 60,000(c) Even if this special intake is approved and the early start is made we should require, to maintain the shorter tour in the second half of 1945, a furtherintake of men from -civil life between January and June amounting to 50,000PART IV.-WOMEN&apos;S SERVICES AND CIVILIANS-AND SUMMARY OFREQUIREMENTS26. A.T.S. During 1944 there has been a substantial shortfall both in the Cabinetallocation and in the actual supply of A.T.S. compared with demands based on themaintenance of the present strength. Reductions in A.T.S. commitments have already been necessary to cover current wastage, and such reductions will be continued in 1945 wherever possible without involving the employment of more soldiers. Certain additional commitmentsnext year, however, are unavoidable, owing to the increased demand for A.T.S. for service overseas, particularly in occupied Germany and liberated countries in N.W. Europe. It isessential that every endeavour should be made to prevent further decreases in strength inthe period January to June, 1945. We therefore require, to cover estimated wastage at,300 per month, an intake of 13.50027. Nursing Officers. The estimated deficiency at 31st December, 1944, is 1,511, towhich must be added wastage at 50 per month for the first half-year. Moreover, because ofthe existing deficiencies, the relief of Nursing Officers with long service overseas has not yetstarted, and for this a pool of 360 is required.The total demand for this period, January to June, 1945, is therefore 2,17028. V.A.Ds. The rate of wastage of V.A.Ds., who replace R.A.M.C. other ranks andmust therefore be considered separately from Nursing Officers, is 30 per month, and thenumber required in the six months January to June, 1945, is 
29- &quot;Non-Industrial &quot; Civilians. The present deficiency in non-industrial civilians isestimated at 2,000, to which must be added a requirement on behalf of the U.S. forces inthe United Kingdom of a further 2,000. Future requirements after the end of the Warwith Germany are, at present, assessed at a further 500 in order to replace soldiers requiredfor service overseas. Normal wastage between now and 30th June, 1945, is likely to be,000 and the total requirement of non-industrial civilians is therefore 30. &quot; Industrial&quot; Civilians. The requirement for the first half-year for industrialcivilians is 16,000, to which must be added 10,000 for U.S. Depots ; making a total of 26,000SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS31.

APPENDIX &quot;A&quot;PYTHONi. PYTHON is the code word given to the exchange of personnel with long service overseas.   For every man sent home a man has to be sent in replacement.2. This exchange was begun in January, 1943, when men with more than six yearsoverseas were returned.   The overseas tour has since been shortened and is now IndiaOther theatres..4 years4-2-4! years.

The saving of 16,200 in October-December by reducing the outward reliefs by 5,400a month is due to releases which it is assumed will begin in October, 1945. Releases are dependent on the reduction of the Army&apos;s commitments. As the India and Middle Eastcommitments will actually increase, the savings are limited to Central Mediterranean.5. During the early release period there will be a considerable number of men overseasbecoming eligible for PYTHON, but on account of age not then eligible for release. it follows, therefore, that concurrently with the earlier releases, PYTHON exchange will still have to continue for the men who month by month reach the expiry of their overseas tour.6. The voyage period for those returning and for their replacements, plus leave andretraining at home, means that every man exchanged is a loss to the Army for five months.A pool to operate the PYTHON exchange is therefore necessary.(B44/188)   no   12/44   W.O.P.   20224
