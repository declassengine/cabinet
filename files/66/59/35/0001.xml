THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December/1944.iSECRET. / Copy No- 11W.P. (44) 735. s   /12th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS SPAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN my memoranda W.P. (44) 691 and W.P. (44) 665 of the 25th and18th November I circulated to my colleagues a translation of a letter from general franco on Anglo-Spanish relations, together with the draft of a reply from thePrime Minister to General Franco. I have revised the draft letter to general franco, in consultation with the Prime Minister and in the light of the cabinet discussion on the 29th November, and I now circulate to my colleagues the revised draft (Annex I) together with an improved translation of General Franco&apos;s letter(Annex II).2. It will no longer be possible for this letter to be handed to GeneTal Francoby Lord Templewood, and action will now have to be taken through the SpanishAmbassador in London.3. I trust that the revised draft will meet with the approval of mycolleagues, in which event the two documents will be communicated to the UnitedStates Government for their information and with a view to ensuring their support prior to communicating the Prime Minister&apos;s letter to the Duke of Albaat an early date.   /4. The Prime Minister also proposes to inform Marshal Stalin of thisexchange, with a view to removing any suspicions which may be held in Sovietcircles regarding our alleged desire to build up a Western group against Russiaor our alleged tenderness towards General Franco and his regime.A. E.Foreign Office, 12th December, 1944.ANNEX I.Draft letter to General Franco from the Prime Minister.Your Excellency, December, 1944.YOUR Ambassador has communicated to the Foreign Secretary a copy ofyour letter to the Duke of Alba in which you expressed a desire for a clarification of Anglo-Spanish relations, with a view to a closer and more intimate relation-ship in the future. I have studied this document with much interest and sohave my colleagues of the War Cabinet. It is our desire that Anglo-Spanishrelations should be close and cordial and I notice, with some surprise, that yourExcellency attributes such difficulties as now exist between Great Britain and spain to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and of British publicopinion, and to the activities of British propaganda and British agents in spain. I can assure your Excellency that your assertions regarding the activitiesof British agents in Spain are entirely without foundation and I can only12602   [28811] , b
suppose that your Government has been misled by the allegations of those persons whose obvious interest lies in disturbing Anglo-Spanish relations. i therefore welcome all the more your Excellency&apos;s suggestion that the time is ripe for a clarification of the position and, after full consultation with my colleagues,and in the name of the War Cabinet, I take this opportunity to set out to yourExcellency in complete frankness the serious difficulties which, in our view, stillhamper the satisfactory development of relations between our two countries.2. I must first remind your Excellency of the policy which your Govern-ment has pursued so far in the present world war, as this policy has appearedto His Majesty&apos;s Government and to the British public which they represent.I do not forget that Spanish policy did not oppose us at two critical momentsof the war, namely, &apos;at the time of the collapse of France in 1940 and at themoment of the Anglo-American invasion of North Africa in 1942. But I alsoremember that throughout the war, German influence in Spain has constantlybeen permitted to embarrass the war effort of Great Britain and her Allies,and that a Spanish Division was actually sent to give assistance to our Germanenemies against our Ally, Russia. During that period the Spanish Governmentopenly pursued a policy not of neutrality but of non-belligerency.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government have had to make many complaints againstunneutral activities in Spain, which I need not now particularise, since they havealready formed the subject of repeated representations to your Government byHis Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Madrid. I feel bound, however, to mention the arbitrary suppression in 1940 of the International regime at Tangier in violation of treaties to wdiich Spain was a party, and the series of speeches in which yourExcellency disparaged this country and others among the United Nations andspoke of their defeat as being both desirable and inevitable.4. &apos; Now that the war is drawing to a close, and plans are being made for thefuture of Europe and of the world, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot overlookthese past actions of the Spanish Government. Nor can they overlook the con-sistently hostile attitude towards this country of the Falange party, which isofficially recognised as the foundation of the present&apos;state structure in Spain, northe fact that the Falange has maintained an intimate relationship with the Naziparty dictatorship in Germany and with the Italian Fascists. I am, however,less concerned with the past than with the&apos; present and the future, and my desireis to see all barriers removed which stand in the way of closer Anglo-Spanishrelations. I had indeed been happy to observe the favourable changes in Spanishpolicy towards this country, which began during the tenure of office of the lateGeneral Jordana, and I publicly took note of these developments in the speech which I made in the House of Commons on the 24th May. Unfortunately, asyour Excellency recognises in your letter to the Duke of Alba, these developments have not yet gone far enough to remove all the barriers between our two countries.While such barriers remain, the development of really close relations of friend-ship and co-operation with Spain, which His Majesty&apos;s Government desire, mustmeet with difficulties and there can be no question of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsupporting Spanish claims to participate in the eventual peace settlement. nor does it seem to me likely that an invitation would be forthcoming for the admission of Spain to the future world organisation.5. In your Excellency&apos;s letter to the Duke of Alba there are severalreferences to Russia which I cannot allow to pass without comment, havingregard to the relations of friendship and alliance between this country and russia. I should be seriously misleading you if I did not at once remove anymisconception that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to consider anygrouping of powers in Western Europe or elsewhere on a basis of hostilitytowards or of the alleged necessity of defence against our Russian allies. Thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government remains firmly based upon the Anglo-soviet treaty of 1942 and they regard the continuance of Anglo-Russian collaborationwithin the framework of the future world organisation as essential not only totheir own interests, but also to the future peace and prosperity&quot;of Europe as awhole.6. I would in conclusion beg your Excellency to believe that I would nothave ventured to put the above considerations so frankly to you, were it not for your Excellency&apos;s own recently-expressed desire for a clarification of Anglo-Spanish relations, and for my conviction that relations of close friendship andco-operation between our two countries are essential and that they can only be developed and maintained within the framework of the principles &quot;which I have set out for your Excellency&apos;s consideration.   ,
ANNEX II.Translation of Letter from General Franco.To His Excellencydon Jacobo FitzJames Stuart, Duke of Alba,Spanish Ambassador in Great Britain.My dear Ambassador and friend,THE purpose of this letter is to convey to you in frank, explicit and straight-forward terms my ideas which are those of the Spanish nation on the subjectof our relations with Great Britain, so that you may transmit them faithfully andwith the utmost frankness to our good friend, the British Prime Minister.The gravity of the European situation, and the role that Great Britain and spain will be called upon to play in the future concert of Western Europe, makeit desirable that we should clarify our relations, eliminating that string of complaints and petty incidents which for two years and more have put such astrain upon them. -The noble words that the Prime Minister not long ago&apos; addressed to Spainwith such favourable effect upon our public opinion and which are in keeping with that other gesture of his .youth when, with such generosity of spirit, heserved under the Spanish flag are a guarantee that these anxieties of ours will beechoed in his own mind.I find it perfectly natural that up to now substantial differences should haveexisted between the British outlook and the attitude which might be adopted bySpain, less-burdened as she is, as a neutral country, with commitments, lessexposed to passions; but, with the progress of the war, the identity of interestsand of concern for the future is assuming a more definite shape, which, indeed,we see revealed in the speeches, statements and commentaries about the PrimeMinister&apos;s journeyings.Because we cannot believe in the good faith of Communist Russia, and because we are alive to the insidious might of Bolshevism, we must regard thedestruction or weakening of her neighbours as greatly increasing her power andambitions, and thus rendering more, necessarv than ever the achievement of knowledge and understanding among the countries of Western Europe.Events in liberated Italy, and the serious plight of France, where the Govern-menfs orders are not obeyed, and the maquis bands brazenly proclaim their intention of establishing a French Soviet Republic, for which they reckon on thesupport of of the U.S.S.R.-all this is an eloquent commentary on these difficultdays.History teaches us, on the other hand, what has always been the end of allthe talk about eternal peace arid disinterested friendships : such fine, high-sounding words cannot therefore represent for us anything but wishful thinking,the expression of a remote ideal, unattained and indeed unattainable.With a Germany annihilated, and a Russia that has consolidated herascendency in Europe and Asia, and the United States similarly dominant inthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as the mightiest nation of the world, the european countries surviving in a devastated Continent will be facing the most serious and dangerous crisis of their history.I realise perfectly well that Englishmen in responsible positions are pre-cluded by military expediency from commenting upon this aspect of the present world struggle; but the reality of the potential menace subsists.After the terrible ordeal which Europe has endured, three of the nations with large populations and extensive resources stand out from the rest: GreatBritain, Germany and Spain. But with Germany destroyed only one countryremains to which Great Britain can turn her gaze : Spain. It is likely thatthe French and Italian defeats, and the process of internal disintegration in.these countries, will make it impossible for many years to build up anythingstable upon their foundations. To do so would entail the same tragic surprisesthat Great Britain and Germany respectively have experienced during the presentconflict. .     ,The deduction is clear : does it suit Britain and Spain to be on terms of mutual friendship? I have no hesitation in asserting that it does, and, thegreater the destruction of the German nation, the more imperative it will be.[28811] &apos; B 2
Having established the need for such a friendship, let us pass on to review*our present relations with Great Britain. &apos; We cannot entertain any great illusionson the subject, and indeed we shall have to recognise that those relations arenot exactly cordial. For, notwithstanding the generous sentiments voiced byMr. Churchill and the good will of our own Government, there has been nodissipation of that atmosphere of uneasy hostility which is perceptible in GreatBritain, and which naturally leads to retaliatory action in the various sectors of Spanish opinion. Neither the British press including Governmental organs nor the British wireless has ceased to show periodically a hostile attitudetowards Spain, her regime and even towards her Leader : sometimes the tonehas been rude and peevish, and at other times they have used insidious phrasingor subtle allusions.Of still greater importance, however, is this hostility when it is discerniblein official representations, or when attempts are made to justify it in terms ofideological differences this from a nation like the British, traditionallyaccustomed to getting on with the various peoples of the world, whatever theirsystems of government or their ideologies : here you have an attitude which, by its obtrusion into estic sphere, has roused every good Spaniard andhas produced regrettable consequences in the country.Great Britain should not forget that the relations of the present time are animmediate consequence of those of the past, and that such relations as we may now maintain are bound to have a considerable influence on those of the future.I consider that we ought not to conceal from the British the fact that theactivities of their secret service and propaganda, involving a clash with thenation&apos;s most live and most sensitive elements the Army, the Police and theFalange with its three million active members have had throughout the past five years a deplorable effect on our relations. We can state with positiveassurance that there has been no petty intrigue nor minor disorder brought to light during these years which has not, in some way or other, been traced backto British agents.The State had no alternative but to take appropriate measures against allunderground activities on the part of foreigners, and the fact that the threeelements mentioned above played a most important part in the discovery andprosecution of such activities has drawn on them the ill-feeling, if not the hatred,of the foreign agents, which in its turn has provoked much indignation among our own people.It is advisable that they should know in London that not one of the politicaland diplomatic stratagems contrived abroad against Spain has passed unnoticedin our country : even those matters that might have been thought to be the mostconfidential and secret have come providentially to our knowledge; but thatthe Spanish State, with a clear vision of the future and of its historical needs,has as much as possible avoided publicity and the ensuing scandal.Another fact to be brought to their notice is that the British intelligence service has derived its information, at any rate in our view here in Spain oiotto speak of what they may have gleaned from the Beds and malevolentpoliticians from the most frivolous and ineffectual elements in the country.I fear therefore that the views and the news which Britain may have about our country are likely to be inaccurate or distorted.Taking all this into account, I have deemed it necessary for the sake of thefuture needs of both our countries, to try at this historic moment to clarify ourrelations, in an endeavour to free them from that tendentious and hostileatmosphere which is incompatible with sincere friendship in the days to come.The present war has completely altered old ideas of strategy and of therelative strengths of the various Powers; everything has grown in size, and ifthe nations want to avoid unpleasant surprises, they must throw overboard ancientprejudices and strengthen their continental solidarity.And, just as it would be vain to expect that Spain should now act against their convictions and take advantage of other nations&apos; misfortunes, thus failing inthe principles of honour and chivalry that have prevailed throughout her history,and have given it the stamp of nobility principles that are summed up in thetypical Spanish saying &quot; Nobleza obliga &quot; so, on the other hand, it would be only fitting that we should strive to establish closer relations and make possiblecommon action in the future.It is worth emphasising that Spain is a country of strategic importance, andthat the Spanish people are sound, virile and chivalrous; that she has given proof of her spiritual reserves and her resources of courage and energy; that she hasthe will to exist, without harbouring base ambitions, loves peace and knows how
to maintain it; that she believes it to &quot;be in heTown interest and in that of GreatBritain that they should establish mutual understanding, for she appreciatesthe value of British friendship while fully conscious of the value of her own;that she considers this understanding and future friendship to be possible, butbelieves, nevertheless, that it could not be effective or lasting if confined to a mereenunciation in lifeless words, without a complete change in the premisses ofour relations, if there is a lack of sincerity, of good faith or of the firmdetermination to achieve that mutual understanding; it could not endure if,because of old jealousies and the old spirit of domination arousing suspicion ofthe increasing greatness of the friend and partner, if we could not remove, at whatever sacrifice, the differences that divide us.To conclude I think you must make one thing quite clear, in view of theactivities of bad Spaniards who from outside the country speculate on thepossibility of internal changes, and who, relying only on the strength of theirpassions, might fancy they could effect a rapprochement by giving Britain abetter bargain the very idea is so fantastic that we ought not even to discusssuch a possibility you must emphasise that any such hypothetical change ofregime, I say this with all due emphasis, would serve the interests of Russia alone.In foreign affairs all of us responsible Spaniards think alike, and history showsthat it is not so difficult to win Spain&apos;s friendship and her heart.After laying bare to you frankly and faithfully my ideas, it only remainsfor me to entrust to your patriotism and active intelligence the task of conveyingthese sentiments to the man upon whose shoulders rests the greatest responsibilityfor the future of Europe.\)With sincere affection,FRANCISCO FRANCO.Palace of El Pardo, l%th October, 1944.
