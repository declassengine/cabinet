(An outline map is included as an inset.)General.22. The First French Army has made further progress west of Colmar andthe enemy is withdrawing towards the Rhine on a wide front. In the Saarfurther extensive gains have been made. Haguenau and Sarreguemines havebeen occupied. West of Duren the First U.S. Army is steadily pressing theenemy back towards the line of the River Roer. Fierce fighting continues inthis area.Southern Group of A armies.23. The First French Army has continued to force the enemy towards the rhine along practically the whole of its front. Enemy strong points in thenorthern outskirts of Mulhouse were cleared by the 9th and the advance pressed on 3 miles north of the town against stubborn resistance. The last enemy bridge-head over the Rhine between Mulhouse and the Swiss border was eliminated onthe 11th. In the Vosges, advances of from 1 to 4 miles have taken place on a25-mile front, Thann was cleared on the 10th and bridgeheads secured across theRiver Thur in the vicinity of the town. S.W. of Selestat, U.S. troops have continued their advance and are within 3 miles of Colmar.
51G6North of Strasbourg, the Seventh U.S. Army has made good progress. Onthe right, the Rhine has been reached S.E. of Bischweiler, Haguenau was liberatedon the 11th and forward elements pushing eastwards are now within 3 miles ofthe German border. In the centre a rapid advance cleared Reichshoven on the11th. On the left an advance of 6 miles on a 10-mile front has brought U.,S-troops to within 1 mile of Bitche.Central Group of Armies.24. S.E. of Sarreguemines the Third U.S. Army crossed the River Saaron the 9th and has advanced 5 miles. Sarreguemines fell on the 10th, and U.S.troops have crossed the German frontier on a wide front north of the town. Inthe sector north of Saarlautern fighting is now in progress in the Siegfrieddefences. Our bridgeheads have been reinforced in spite of repeated counter-attacks by the enemy. Little progress is being made in widening these bridge-heads.  Heavy fighting continues in this in the Hurtgen Forest the First U.S. Army has exerted steady pressure onthe enemy, and numerous counter-attacks have been repulsed. U.S. troops havereached the Roer 2 miles N.W. of Duren, having advanced 3 miles against stiffopposition. Further north in the Julich area, enemy organised resistance ceasedwest of the Roer on the 9th.Northern Group of Armies.25. During the week activity on this front has been confined to patrolling.No serious increase in the flooding between the Lower Rhine and the Waal hasbeen reported since the 9th. ,Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)26. The latter part of last week was confined to mopping-up operationsnorth of Ravenna by Canadian forces, and to heavy fighting in the area S.W. ofFaenza. In this area, British troops have made some progress, but fighting hasbeen very fierce and enemy resistance most determined. For the past few days the fighting in this sector has died down a little, but has flared up further north.On the night the 10th/11th, Canadian forces launched an attack over the RiverLamone to the east of Lugo. This attack met with immediate success and twobridgeheads were established. On the 11th these two bridgeheads were linked up,and bridges were built over the River Lamone. The depth of the bridgehead is over 1^ miles along a 7-mile front. Armour and supporting arms have passed into the bridgehead. On the 13th, fierce fighting took place along the CanalNaviglio. Canadian infantry established one bridgehead across this carnal and held it despite numerous heavy counter-attacks.Elsewhere on the front in Italy there has been very little activity. Enemyartillery has been more active than of late in the area south of Bologna.The Eastern European Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)27. The main feature of the week&apos;s fighting was a fresh Russian attackN.E. of Budapest, which broke through the German defences, and now threatensto outflank the city on the north. The Russians hold a deep salient in this area,with its northern flank on the 1938 Czechoslovak frontier and its southern onthe Danube 8 miles north of Budapest. At the same time the Russians have gained a little ground N.W. of Miskolc.Further south the Russians cleared the whole of the southern shore of lake Balaton (SW. of Budapest) and. captured the railway junction of Bares.They have therefore strengthened their hold on southern Hungary and are well placed to attempt the encirclement of Budapest from the south. The danger tothe city from the south, where the Russians are well established across the Danube,,is more pressing than the threat from the north, where they are at present stillon the eastern bank.Greece.Athens.28. ELAS have increased the scale of their attacks on British and Greekregular forces in the Athens area. In the centre of the capital, British troops,hold the government quarter, but they have been subjected to constant attack and shelling by day and to infiltration by night.[28830] &apos;. ... b 2
By the 10th, ELAS were in control of a considerable part of the Peirseus,but since then British troops, who have received reinforcements, have succeeded in clearing much of the port area.Salonika and rest of Greece.29. EAM/ELAS are in control of Salonika and the majority of the restof Greece, except in Patras, Volos and Kavalla where there are detachmentsof Imperial troops.  Strikes have taken place in Salonika and Patras.There has also been unrest, strikes and in some cases fighting in the ^Egeanislands, but in most of them ELAS have now given up their arms.Burma.30. East African troops have advanced 5 miles along the Kalewa-PyingaingRoad and are now approaching the outskirts of Shwegyin. Further up theChindsvin River Allied troops advancing eastwards from the Mawlaik bridgeheadare now 9 miles N.W. and 16 miles S.W. of Indaw. Further north, our troopsadvancing from the Sittaung bridgehead are only 12 miles west of Pinlebu.British troops entered Indaw, in the Myitkyina-Mandalay railway corridor,on the 11th without encountering opposition. They also entered Katha on theIrrawaddy, 14 miles to the east, again encountering no opposition.Chinese troops have made some progress on the Bhamo-Namhkam Road andhave reached a point some 15 miles from Namhkam. They are in contact to thesouth of the road.Troops of the Chinese Expeditionary Force have made further progressdown the Lungling-Namhkam Road. They are now only 8 miles N.W. ofWanting and 10 miles from the Burma border.China.    *31. The Japanese drive towards Kweiyang has halted, and the leadingelements which had nearly reached Tuyun have withdrawn, presumably forregrouping. Chinese forces have now reoccupied the railway south from Tuyunto a point some 7 miles north of Nantan.Japanese troops advancing N.E. from the French Indo-China border havenow made contact with those thrusting S.W. from Nanning, and the main road from Nanning to Lungchow and Langson is in Japanese hands.Philippines.32. On the 6th a U.S. Infantry Division made an amphibious landing on thewestern coast of Leyte at a point 3 miles south of Ormoc. On the 10th, Ormocwas captured and a junction was effected with other U.S. forces advancing up thecoast, at Albuera. By the 11th, these latter forces had linked up with the leadingelements of another U.S. division advancing westwards from the Burauen area.A considerable number of Japanese are thus encircled. The Japanese casulties on Leyte up to the 10th were 29,579 killed and over 200 prisoners of war havebeen taken.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.33. Fighter Command flew 74 defensive sorties against flying-bombs.Attacks on long-range rocket sites in Holland are referred to in paragraph 35and details of enemy activity against this country are given in paragraph 45.Home Waters.34.

A railway station and a large building connected with rocket activity at The Hague, and rolling-stock and a flak tram on The Hague-Amsterdam railway were also hit and considerably damaged.A night attack on German naval units off Horten (Oslo Fiord) was made bya force &quot;of Lancasters and Mosquitoes, which dropped 121 tons. Weather was clear but visual identification was extremely difficult and bombing results werenot observed.In the battle area, two heavy daylight attacks were made by Lancasterson a dam on the River Urft, 14 miles south of Duren, 1,864 tons being dropped in difficult weather conditions. Photographs taken soon after the first attackshow that many bombs had fallen close to the target, but there appeared to be neither breaching of the dam nor any leakage of water. In the second attack themajority of the crews bombed through gaps in the cloud, but observation of resultswas extremely difficult. Direct hits are claimed but there is no evidence of serious damage.Among other targets attacked were defended villages, on which at least,000 tons were dropped, two barracks in the Saar (109 tons), billeting areas southof Roermond and communications. Railway lines were cut in a large number of places, several bridges, locomotives and gun positions and many road and railwayvehicles were destroyed or damaged.A total of 2,205 sorties was flown by aircraft carrying supplies to theContinent.The week ended dawn on the 10th was marked by the first German long-rangebomber operation since the 19th September. On this occasion between 40 and50 Ju. 88 laid mines at the mouth of the Scheldt. G.A.F. fighter activity was onan increased scale, indicating some reinforcement of the force based in western germany.
