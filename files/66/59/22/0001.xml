3103ANNEX I.Copy of a letter dated November 1944 from the Earl of Munster to theSecretary of State for India.My dear Secretary of State,I attach to this most secret letter a copy of my report on the welfare arrange-ments for British troops in the India and S.E.A. Commands. I have, inaccordance with your wishes, communicated a copy of this letter and the reportto the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, both of whom Thave asked to deferany circulation whatever until such time as you have had an opportunity of considering it.2. It has not been easy in compiling the report to ensure that it is suitablein its entirety for publication. Many of the recommendations may require futher consideration and you may therefore judge it advisable to amend thereport in certain respects before issue. I have throughout my report drawn attention to the lack of welfare facilities and to the need for providing additionalamenities which I consider should be available for British troops. This shouldnot be taken, to imply that the military authorities have not made every effort toprovide amenities. I am satisfied that much progress has been made during thelast 18 months. But it must be remembered that camps, hospitals, workshop and many other urgent works necessary for establishing a large military basehad to be built and fitted out before the provision of amenity buildings on anadequate scale could be undertaken. The calls made upon, the military machinefor operational projects are heavy and there is still a lack even a severe shortage of all building material and labour. In consequence, work on a number ofamenity projects already sanctioned is held up.You will recall that I telegraphed to you earlier in my tour suggesting thatthe possibility of importing pre-fabricated buildings should be explored. Thiswould, I believe, help to reduce the heavy overload on India&apos;s capacity, which isthe fundamental obstacle to any rapid progress.3. There are one or two highly important matters which I have leftunmentioned in my report, as being, in &quot;my view, unsuitable for publication.First, the question uppermost in every man&apos;s mind is undoubtedly repatria-tion. I am convinced that the number of statements made at home andMountbatten&apos;s recent pronouncement out here have caused a good deal of mis-understanding. The very number of the statements made in itself creates a feeling of confusion in the minds of troops, who ask above all for a definite andfirm date to which they can look forward. Frequent comparisons are drawn between the Army period of service in India and that of the R.A.F. and theAmerican forces. I tried to explain to many men in the course of my rounds thedifficulties of making any definite commitment owing to the calls upon man-power and the impossibility of forecasting with any degree of accuracy the future course of operations. I was, however, impressed with the requests made on many occasions by numbers of troops (whom I met in tents and huts without their officers) that a statement on this subject should be made by the Prime Minister,in whom every man has complete confidence and trust. I am satisfied that ifany such statement could be made, even though it contained no definite promisebut explained the difficulties, it would be accepted.Secondly, I have alluded above to the comparisons frequently drawn with american conditions of service in India. I was entertained to luncheon in theAmerican hospital at Chabua in Northern Assam and I took this to be a fairexample of their standards. It can only be described as &quot; jungle luxury.&quot; Theyhad installed every kind of electrical equipment even down to a salt-dryingmachine and nearby was a coca-cola manufacturing plant and a formidablebattery of ice-cream machines. The existence of all these amenities, over and above the provision of tinned beer, is of course fully known to our troops, whofrequently ask why something in this line cannot be done for them, particularly as they are aware that many of the works involved were carried out by Britishengineer^ The differences in pay also loom large, and United Kingdom troopscompare their rates of pay unfavourably with those of Dominion and american troops.
In the course of my stay in Calcutta, I saw no particular signs of f raternisa-tion or friction between British and American troops, but I am certain that thedisparities mentioned above cause a good deal of heart-burning and to a great extent must operate as a bar to good mutual relations.Thirdly, I found much anxiety amongst troops regarding their future afterthe war. Many are aware of their reinstatement rights, but a number of them have impressed upon me their need for refresher courses before they will be fittedfor re-employment in their former occupations. I understand that the wholequestion of vocational training is under discussion between the India Office andthe Government of India. I would recommend that the question of establishingpermanent Ministry of Labour representatives in India should be considered.They would, in my opinion, do useful liaison work and their presence wouldreassure troops that their interests were being closely watched by the authorities at home.Fourthly, I am definitely of the opinion that the existing staff of the Welfareorganisation is not only insufficient in quantity but also in some cases of poor quality. It is of the utmost importance that welfare officers should be youngand active and not of low medical category. In addition, they should have been recently in close contact with fighting troops. I am further satisfied that officersin the Directorate of Welfare at General Headquarters should tour widely and often so as to maintain the closest touch with the actual needs of troops. Asregards the welfare of Indian formations in particular, it seems to me very desirable that Indian welfare officers should be appointed both at headquarters and in the field.Fifthly, there is the question of duty on the importation of canteen stores,which is now limited to beer, spirits and tobacco. If additional quantities ofthese commodities are to be imported so as to raise the existing ration, I am firmlyconvinced that they should be allowed into India free of duty. All Americanstores enter free of duty.Sixthly, India has been divided into concessional and non-concessional areas and this division affects allowances, hospital stoppages, rations, &amp;c. These areas were defined at a time when Japanese aggression was acute, but the line of divisionis now unrealistic, and both officers and men have commented adversely on it.I understand that the question of revision has been under consideration for some18 months, but the effects of such revision are proving difficult to estimate.It may well be that some adjustment rather than complete abolition is the fairestsolution, but whatever the answer an early decision is desirable. As an instanceof the effects of the present distinction, I might mention that officers in a conces-sional area receive free rations and pay only Re.l/-/- per day for messing,whereas in a non-concessional area officers pay any sum up to Us.3/8/- per day for messing and receive no free rations.Seventhly, at the beginning of my tour I was concerned with the numberof complaints I continually received about the quantity and quality of the rationsprovided for the troops. I have given much thought and consideration to thismatter and I am certain that the real trouble is the lack of variety and badcooking. I have referred in my report to the same complaints in hospitals whichis really of general application.Eighthly, a large number of mobile bath and laundry units are required,particularly in the 14th Army.Ninthly, the Chairman of the War Savings Committee whom I saw at Simlatold me that in 1943 the total sum invested in War Savings was  477,000. Thisyear the figure up to now has reached  853,000. He estimates that the amountinvested during the months of August and September amounted to 1\ per cent,of the total pay for the Army and R.A.F. It seems reasonable to assume that additional sums are sent home by officers and men privately and this figure issaid to be an additional 2-1 per cent. I think you will probably agree that itwould be useful to carry out continuously a vigorous drive to stimulate Savings,especially now that the troops are in receipt of increased pay.Tenthly, I spoke to the Adjutant-General about the officers who were atone time compulsorily posted to the Indian Army and he has informed me verballythat a telegram has now been sent to the War Office with certain recommenda-tions. I gather that the intention is to give these officers the right to transfer to British service if they wish to do so.   This seems to me to be the answer to
jp    \  f\109this thorny- problem which you will recall was discussed in the House on the21st July last.4. I now turn to deal with certain paragraphs of my report about whichI should like to make additional remarks.Canteens.It is certain that when the new rates of pay come into force and freshcontingents of troops arrive in India more money will be expended in Canteensand extra supplies must therefore be available to meet the demands. The Canteenauthorities have provided me with a formidable statement of their requirements,which I hope to be able to discuss with you when I return.Women.I am not in a position to judge whether European women in India are fully employed in war work. In some places I have visited the general opinion was thatthe majority are doing all they can, but in other places there is a difference ofopinion on this point. The Registration of Women now proceeding should throwfurther light on this question. Whatever conclusion may be reached, however, itis certain that the number of European women is absolutely inadequate to fillall the posts for which English women are required. A further important point which should not be lost sight of is that most of the women have already done along period in India without returning home, and the majority will undoubtedlyreturn to England the moment they can. There are a comparatively small numberof women now at home who desire to rejoin their husbands in India, but even ifthey all came and immediately took up war work their presence could notappreciably alter the position.I can see no alternative than to bringing out a large number from homewilling and qualified to do the work involved.From my discussions with senior officers I am further convinced that A.T.S.should be sent out in large numbers to work at G.H.Q. and other command H.Q.and to assist in leave camps, cantesns, &amp;c. This would to some extent relieve theshortage of man-power, and their presence in India would be of inestimable value to the morale of British troops.Postal Facilities.I am still of the opinion that the present ration of air letters should bemaintained, but that they should be carried free. In deference, however, to the wish expressed in your telegram, I have not mentioned this in my report. Ibelieve that the present allowance of 8 air letters a month meets the needs of thegreat majority of officers and men and that an increase in the ration will not be appreciated as a worth-while concession. Free carriage of the air letter, on theother hand, would be of immediate benefit to all.Travel.I have expressed myself strongly on this subject in my report, but, as I havestated, the main difficulty is the shortage of rolling stock and this cannot be improved in a day. By far the worst conditions are those obtaining on the14th Army leave line from Manipur Road to Calcutta and it is in this area thatimprovement is most urgently required. The load on the line is extremely heavy and any relief would be welcome to the military authorities. The only effective means of relieving the situation is the provision of a pool of aircraft which wouldhave to be kept distinct and separate from aircraft employed in operations. Atthe present time a man proceeding on leave from the forward areas may takeanything up to 10 days to reach his leave station and the return journey is ofthe same duration. The use of air transport would cut out this unprofitablewaste of time.Council of Voluntary War Workers.There is in existence &quot;at the moment good co-operation between thephilanthropic bodies and the Directorate of Welfare and I am convinced that thepresent arrangements are functioning to the satisfaction of all concerned. Therecan be no real necessity to bring in a further organisation through which all thephilanthropic bodies will submit their demands. The Directorate of Welfareis fully capable of co-ordinating their requirements and sending them home.
5. Although my tour was intended to cover British and Indian troops Ihave, generally speaking, seen far more of British personnel. I have made some reference to this in paragraph 5 of my report, but you will see that the reportin fact contains comparatively little about Indian troops. I realise this may cause some political difficulties if the report is published but nevertheless I think we must be prepared to accept this criticism.I understand that Sir Firoz Khan Noon has toured Indian troops in theMiddle East and it might be useful if arrangements Were made for him or someoneelse to undertake a tour similar to my own in India having special regard to indian troops. If this proposal was acceptable to you and to the militaryauthorities in India,&apos;1 suggest an announcement might be made corresponding to the date when the report is published in England.6. I am bringing with me the factual statement which you asked for andthe minutes of a meeting which I attended at General Headquarters. Theseprovide a good deal of background for my report,7. I am also bringing with me a statement from the Command Paymaster,who, I am reasonably satisfied, is doing all he can to reform the Pay Branchwhich he frankly admits was in a chaotic condition when he took over.8. I am not fully satisfied that Lieutenant-Colonel&quot; Wakeham, who isreturning to the India Office as A.A.G. (Welfare), is of the correct seniority inrank and it may be necessary for him to be made a full Colonel, but before taking any action I suggest you discuss this point with General Mayne.9. I attach some importance to the provision of more mobile canteens inthe forward areas. I saw a small number and they were performing admirablework but an addition to their numbers is required.10. You may be interested to know that in the course of my tour I visited82 Clubs and Canteens, 12 Leave Centres, 3 W.A.C. (I) Hostels, 9 Transit Camps,34 Hospitals, 28 Units, 5 United States Army and 11 Miscellaneous.Yours ever,(Signed) MUNSTER.
ANNEX   II.REPORT   BY THE EARL  OF MUNSTER ON THE WELFARE  OFTROOPS IN INDIA AND SOUTH-EAST ASIA COMMANDS.Introductory.IN September 1944 the Prime Minister instructed me to proceed to India to investigate the provision made for the welfare of troops in India and South-East Asia Commands, and to report thereon to the Secretary of State for India.I left England on the 2nd October and proceeding via Naples and Cairo reachedDelhi on the 10th October.2. The programme arranged for me included visits to Ranchi, Calcutta,Comilla, Cox.&apos;s Bazaar, Chittagong, Imphal, Colombo, Kandy, Madras, Bangalore,Secunderabad, Poona, Bombay and Simla, and enabled me to see conditions ofservice in both forward and rearward areas. [In the course of my tour I visited82 Clubs and Canteens, 12 Leave Centres, 3 W.A.C.(I) Hostels, 9 Transit Camps,34 Hospitals, and 28 Units, 5 United States Army and 11 Miscellaneous. ]* Ihad the advantage of discussions with the Viceroy, the Commander-in-Chief and senior staff officers in Delhi at the beginning and on my tour; and also with theSupreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia, in Kandy. Besides visitingcanteens, camps, hospitals and other institutions, I had every opportunity of discussing conditions with the troops themselves and ascertaining ,their maintroubles. I was thus able to gain a general impression of the conditions wfiichprevail. I have borne in mind that as my itinerary was known in advance, Iprobably saw things at their best, but I generally found means of ascertaining wether divergencies from the normal were observable on the occasion of myvisits.3. My report necessarily concerns itself more with&apos; deficiencies than with existing amenities. The main points which were brought to my notice are dis-cussed later, but I would make some general observations by way of preface.[I have throughout my report drawn attention to the lack of welfarefacilities and to the need for providing additional amenities which I considershould be available for British troops. This should not be taken to imply that themilitary authorities have not made every effort to provide amenities. I am satisfied that much progress has been made during the last- 18 months. But itmust be remembered that camps, hospitals, workshops and many other-urgentworks necessary for establishing a large military base had to be built and fittedout before the provision of amenity buildings on an adequate scale could beundertaken. The calls made upon the military machine for operational projectsare heavy and there is still a lack even a severe shortage of all buildingmaterial and labour. In consequence work on a number of amenity projectsalready sanctioned is held up.]4. Troops arriving in India have to adapt themselves to an environmentquite different from anything that they are accustomed to in the West and manychanges from ordinary European ways of living are inevitable. Although someof the large cities have been partly Westernised, there is a general lack ofcertain amenities which are taken for granted in a European country. Forexample, cinemas catering for European tastes are few and there are no publichouses and little organised public amusement. Hence British troops cannot beleft to find entertainment and relaxation for themselves; almost everything in theway of amenities and absolutely everything in the more remote stations has to beprovided specially for them.  This fact conditions the whole problem.5. This does not, of course, apply so much to Indian troops, who are serving in their own country. But India is of vast size, and men from one: Province donot always find themselves at home in another. Even for India troops in therearward areas much has to be done, while in the forward areas they are just asdependent on the amenities supplied for them as are British troops. Though myunfamiliarity with Indian languages and tastes makes it more difficult for me to* Note. The passages in brackets in paragraphs 2, 3 and 56 have been taken from lord Munster&apos;8 covering letter to the Secretary of State for India and inserted atLord Munster&apos;s request. It is proposed that if the Keport is made public they should beincluded. ,   - &apos;
appreciate their needs, and someone better qualified in these respects might place the emphasis differently and point to other directions in which improvement isrequired, I have referred to the needs of Indian troops wherever appropriate.6. The welfare and contentment of troops is affected by many factors, andnot only by measures specially directed towards securing their well-being.Difficulties over pay, for example, bulk at least as large as shortage of wirelesssets. I have included in this report all the important matters which came to mynotice as affecting the well-being of troops. It necessarily touches on a wide range of subjects, many of which have little to connect them with one anotherexcept that they all bear on the welfare of the Services, and the arrangement ofthe items, is therefore, somewhat disjointed. Speaking broadly, I have dealtfirst with conditions at home which affect British troops serving in India; secondlywith conditions on duty and on leave; and lastly with conditions when sick orwounded. But it will be apparent that such distinctions cannot be taken very far, and most of the sections of the report must be read as self-contained.Publicity at home.7. Troops in the India and South-East Asia Commands feel strongly thattheir achievements and the conditions under which they have to fight have notbeen brought sufficiently prominently before their fellow countrymen.8. The campaign fought by the 14th Army is not always sensational on thegrand scale, but it is always arduous and bitter. The fighting qualities of theseseasoned troops engaged in mortal combat in terrible climate conditions deservethe highest commendation. At the same time troops stationed or training for future battles in India are playing an important role which will grow inmagnitude as time goes by.9. Occasional stereotyped tributes such as have appeared in the past give only momentary satisfaction and consistent publicity through the press, cinemaand wireless is required to dispel the feeling of being forgotten. The remedy liesmainly with the authorities at home. More and more prominently featuredarticles based on reliable first hand information are required, and material for adequate publicity should not be difficult to find.Much could be done by press conferences, interviews and talks on the wirelessby officers and men returning home from this theatre of war.Another valuable medium of publicity which should not be neglected is the film. So far as I am aware, no documentary film depicting conditions on this front has yet been shown in the United Kingdom, though good and ample material in the form of news reels has been sent home. A good film would have the greatestpublicity value besides serving as a means for preparing troops for service inIndia and Burma.10. T would stress the importance of informing home opinion of the realitiesand significance of service in this theatre as one of the most essential measures that should be taken to maintain the morale of British troops.Preparation for Indian Service.11. I have already referred to the great difference between European and indian conditions of living, and as much information and instruction as possible should be given to troops in advance to prepare them for the change. I believethat this has already been done to some extent, but that security and other considerations have operated to prevent any full course of preparation beforetroops leave the United Kingdom. I hope that every effort will be made to over-come any difficulties there may be and to provide as much information as possible before the troops embark. Arrangements should also be made to continue thiseducative process on the voyage out. The means should not be difficult to find :lectures by officers familiar with the conditions to be expected, pamphlets, picturesand if possible films should all be made available.Conditions on the journey out.12. I have no direct knowledge of the conditions prevailing on the voyageout from home but complaints were made to me about overcrowding, the high cost or lack of soft drinks and the absence of amenities on board ship. On theother hand, the most recent arrivals whom. I saw at Deolali Camp had no adversecomments to make.   Nevertheless, the matter may be worth further investigation.
Arrival in India.13. All British reinforcements for India and South-East Asia Commandsare held at Deolali Camp, and it is from this camp.that the soldier obtains his first impressions of service conditions in India. It is, therefore, essential thatit should be of the highest possible standard. I am satisfied that conditions inthis camp in the past have left much to be desired, and are still unsatisfactory.Accommodation is for the most part tented. A building programme on atemporary hutted scale has been approved, and it is hoped to complete it beforethe next monsoon. Other improvements have recently been made, and more are contemplated, but their fulfilment awaits the completion of other works whichwill release the labour and materials required. Bearing in mind the significance of this camp, I regard its maintenance at a high standard as being of the greatest importance, and deserving of unremitting attention by all concerned.Travelling.14. Having throughout my tour travelled by air, I cannot speak with first-hand knowledge of travelling conditions for troops. But I heard a great dealabout them, particularly in the 14th Army area, and I have no doubt that they need to- be improved.15. British troops travelling by rail are issued with 2nd class warrants but2nd class carriages are few. and troops nearly always have to travel in lower classaccommodation. Most of the complaints arise out of this, circumstance.Ultimately, the remedy lies in the provision of more rolling-stock,, but manyimprovements should be possible even in existing conditions.16. Overcrowding of trains is the first source of trouble, and is difficult to eliminate until more rolling-stock is available. Indian troops travel 3rd class, andthey too suffer in the same way. Lack of lighting, due to shortage of bulbs andtheft, is another hardship. But the main complaints are directed against thedirtiness of accommodation provided and the difficulty of obtaining food en route.17. As regards uncleanliness, the carriages themselves are often unwashedand unswept, and no suitable lavatory accommodation is available. I believe thatthe railway administrations are short of responsible officials&apos; to supervise thecleaning staff, and this may account for much of the trouble, but neverthelessevery possible step must be taken to improve the present situation.18. As regards the provision of meals, food is not normally available onthe trains themselves. Troops take rations with them, but there are no facilitiesfor cooking or for making tea. I understand that a scheme for providing food atstations is now beginning to operate, and I trust that its success will be closelywatched.19. Troops required to detrain and wait for an appreciable time&apos; are normally accommodated at rest or transit camps. I visited a number of these and satisfied myself that there is much room for improvement in their standardof comfort and hygiene. Arrangements for sleeping, washing and feeding are often inadequate, and electric light and recreational facilities are generallylacking. The camps are frequently required to accommodate far more than their capacity, and the supervisory and administrative staff is often below strength.I attach great importance to remedying the defects in these camps as soon aspossible.Leave.20. Troops serving in India and South-East Asia Commands are normallyeligible for 28 days&apos; leave each year and accommodation is provided in a numberof camps, hostels and private nouses throughout India. It must be recognisedthat leave taken in India cannot in any circumstances be equivalent to a periodof leave enjoyed in familiar surroundings at home. It is, therefore, all the moreimportant that leave camps should be maintained at a high standard, thatcomforts and amenities should be liberally provided, and that overt military control should be reduced to the minimum. .At some of the leave camps visiting-hostesses had been appointed and were performing excellent work. Their presencemade a great difference, and it is hoped that it will be possible to provide suchhostesses at all leave camps.
21. In the early part of 1944, it became clear that the existing accommo-dation and the movement facilities available were insufficient to allow every manto avail himself of the full period of 28 days&apos; leave, and accordingly the leaveperiod was reluctantly cut to 14 days. At the same time a plan was at onceput in hand to provide additional accommodation for 1945 so as to ensure that every soldier should be given the full period of leave during the coming year.Every possible effort must be made to restore the normal period of leave in fulland the extra accommodation required must be erected in sufficient time.22. In the course of my tour, I visited a number of leave centres and I am satisfied from conversations with troops on the spot that the prevailing conditionsare generally speaking&apos; fairly good; but the standard is apt to differ from place to place. Much improvement has taken place during 1944 through the instructionof a standard,scale of accommodation and furniture for leave camps, and theprovision of many items of ordnance equipment which were not previouslyauthorised.Pay.23. A very common complaint made to me was that men had not receivedpay statements over long periods, and were thus put to great inconvenience and sometimes distress. There seems to be little doubt that until very recently thesecomplaints were justified. I am, however, informed that arrangements now madeprovide for an officer receiving a statement each month, while units can obtain a statement of the accounts of other ranks every three months by application tothe Pajonaster at Meerut (possibly some of the dissatisfaction was due to thefact that units had not heard about or had failed to take advantage of thisfacility).- It is no doubt difficult to obviate delays altogether when a large influx of troops throws an unforeseen burden on the accounting staff, or when men orunits are transferred rapidly from one zone to another. It is, however, a matter to which constant attention should be paid, since ignorance of his financialposition must cause considerable anxiety to the soldier.   ,S.S.A.F.A.24. The object of the association is to assist serving personnel separated from their families in their domestic problems. An Indian Branch, linked withthe parent organisation in the United Kingdom, has its headquarters in NewDelhi and enquiry bureaux in Calcutta, Bangalore and Lahore. Men in Indiawho wish to make enquiries about family matters apply to the enquiry bureaux,who obtain a reply through the organisation in the United Kingdom; converselyfamilies in the United Kingdom can use the organisation to get information about the welfare of soldiers serving in India.25. There is no doubt that troops greatly appreciate the services rendered by the Association, but there is some dissatisfaction on two accounts. In the firstplace, there are not enough bureaux to be readily accessible to all troops or to cope with the volume of work. I am informed that if additional staff can bemade available from the United Kingdom (none being available in India) it isproposed to establish a number of new bureaux, and 1 hope it will be found possibleto send out as many qualified workers as are required. In the second place, Ihave heard some complaints of the slow working of the machinery at home,particularly where applications for compassionate repatriation, to which I referbelow, are under investigation. I know that the organisation at home has recentlyexperienced difficulties due to enemy action, and possibly this has been the causeof some delay. Whatever substance there may be in these complaints, I would suggest that the home organisation for dealing with enquiries from India shouldbe examined, and if it is found that delay is caused by shortage of staff or anyother deficiency, everything possible should be done to improve the position. Anearly response to enquiries cuts out weeks of worrying on the part of men servingat such a great distance from their homes.26. A similar service is performed for Indian troops through the organisa-tion of Civil Liaison Officers and District Soldiers Boards spread throughoutthe country, and I believe that this is working very satisfactorily.Compassionate Repatriation.27. In extreme compassionate cases, which have been defined in an IndiaArmy Order, repatriation to the United Kingdom may be sanctioned. 240 seapassages a month are now allotted for this purpose, and, in addition, 12 airpassages a month have been provided for the most urgent cases.   This is not
inadequate, though the possibility of increasing the provision of air passagesshould be constantly kept under review. The knowledge that repatriation is permissible on compassionate grounds is, I believe, an important factor in main-taining morale, and the quicker the process is the greater the effect.28. Application for repatriation on compassionate grounds can be madeeither by the soldier in India or by his relations or friends in the United Kingdom.In the former case, the soldier submits his application through his unit to G;H.Q.(India) who have to obtain verification of the facts from the United Kingdom.This is sometimes a slow process, firstly because the existing establishment inG.H.Q. is inadequate to cOpe with the work and needs to be strengthened (thereare at present several hundred cases pending) and secondly because, as I have mentioned above, it may take some time for a reply to be received from home.In the latter case, the relations apply through the local S.S.A.F.A. or welfareorganisation in their home town, who verify the facts and pass the applicationon to the War Office, who signal their recommendations to G.H.Q. (India). this second method is far quicker, but I am not clear that it is generally known.Further publicity should be given to it in the United Kingdom, and troops inIndia would be well advised to tell their families that, if occasion arises, theyshould themselves apply to the appropriate local organisation instead of writing to India and leaving the men concerned to put in an application there.Free Leg&apos;al Aid.29. A Legal Aid Organisation exists in India and works in close touchwith the similar organisation in the United Kingdom. This body advises andassists British personnel serving in India in their civil legal problems, includingdivorce.Legal Aid Sections were sanctioned in 1943 at General Headquarters (India)Bangalore, Lahore and Calcutta and a further Legal Aid Section was sanctionedin 1944 for the 14th Army. The Legal Aid Sections act for all the three Servicesand up to date this year 3,506 applications have been received.Criticism is directed against the delays which occur in securing definiteresults; e.g., the average time taken to dispose of divorce cases is 12-15 months in Scotland and 1^ to 2 years in England. I believe that these delays are largely due to overloading of the organisation at home. I would, therefore, suggestthat the organisation should contain a special section, adequately staffed, fordealing with cases from India, and that all cases should be sent by fast air mail.Canteens.30. It would be a long task to describe in detail the history and present organisation of canteens in India and the many difficulties which have been encountered. I shall only say sufficient to provide an adequate background, anddraw attention to the points Which I have found to be of particular concern to troops.31. Until July 1942, the Army in India relied upon the Canteen Contractors&apos;Syndicate, a purely commercial organisation, to provide canteen facilities. TheSyndicate was for various reasons unfitted to cope with the changing conditionsbrought about by the war, arid the Government of India, therefore, assumed responsibility, though, as will be seen, the contractor system was not altogetherdisplaced. The new organisation is briefly as follows. A board of Control,composed of high Government and Army officers, was set up to sanction scales of procurement and to control policy and finance generally. Under it is a Boardof Administration, which is the executive authority charged with carrying outthe policy and directions of the Board of Control, and is responsible for thepreparation of demands, purchase of stores^ distribution and the preparation of wholesale and retail price lists. The Agency for distribution and supply underthe Board of Administration differs in the 14th Army area and in the rest ofIndia. Iri the 14th Army area, the canteens are rim by military personnel (theIndian Canteen Corps) and draw their supplies from a network of advance BaseCanteen Depots and Canteen Bulk Issue Depots, which, iri turn, are supplied from a Canteen Stores Department depot in Calcutta. In the rest of India,contractors, employing civilian personnel, are appointed for military stations andareas, each operating and responsible for all Canteens (other than, those run by[28799] . D
voluntary effort) within his station or area. These contractors draw their require-ments from Canteen Stores Department depots, which are distributed throughout India.32. The accepted policy is that the same price should be charged for thesame article everywhere. Wholesale and retail prices are fixed by authority, andcontractors are required to sell at the authorised price. This control, however,only applies to non-perishable goods; perishable goods, such as fresh food, haveto be obtained locally by contractors and, owing to the variations in local prices in the open market, it is impossible to prescribe uniform scales. local commanders are responsible for ensuring that the prices charged are reasonable.33.   The complaints which I have heard fall under the following heads : (1) Shortages of certain commodities.This complaint undoubtedly had some substance at an earlier stage, but Iam satisfied that, except for beer, of which I have made special mention elsewhere,and brown boot polish, the stocks held and on order by the canteen&apos; organisationare adequate and of sufficient variety. It remains true that unit canteens arenot always able to supply what the troops require. This is in part due to over-cautious, indenting and difficulties in moving stores. But I believe that complaintson this score are much fewer than they were, and are likely to get progressivelyless. Some shortages due to impossibility of procurement either in India or abroadare, of course, inevitable.(2) High prices.As explained above, prices, generally speaking, are fixed by authority and areuniform throughout India, subject to small local increases permitted in special cases, e.g., to allow for the incidence of local taxation which is still levied insome places (whether it should be levied is a matter which seems to deserveinvestigation). I have compared the prices charged over a wide range of articlesby the Canteen Stores Department with those charged by NAAFI in Ceylon andin Egypt and Cyrenaica, and find that in some cases the Indian price is higherand in others lower. It is difficult to give a general verdict, but on the wholeI think that prices charged by the Canteen Stores Department come reasonably well out of the comparison. .There is, however, more cause for disquiet about the prices charged for supplies obtained by contractors locally. They are not subject to any controlexcept the supervision of the military Commander concerned, and in many places the men at least think that the charge made, for example, for tea and forsnack meals (where they are provided) are unreasonably high. Here again itis difficult to reach a verdict of universal application; but I am satisfied that unless the closest supervision is exercised, overcharging is likely to occur. Notonly, therefore, should local commanders exercise the greatest vigilance, butexpert inspection and advice by the canteen organisation is also in my viewrequired.(3) Quality of certain lines of goods.I did not find this a general cause of complaint. It is probably true that troops are on the whole conservative in their tastes, and like brands to whichthey are accustomed; hence there was at one time dissatisfaction with substitutes,generally of Indian manufacture, which the Canteen Stores Departmentintroduced provisionally when the supply position was difficult. But troops are, I understand, showing an increasing readiness to take to new lines supplied from America and elsewhere, and generally speaking the quality of goods sold in canteens seemed to me satisfactory.One item about which there were definite complaints was cigarettes. Notonly the ration issue, but also brands sold in canteens, are disliked. There arealso complaints about the packing of cigarettes, which unless sealed in airtightcontainers arrived in forward areas damp and discoloured. I understand thatthe authorities concerned are doing all that is possible to meet these objections.(4) Lack of amenities in canteens.It will be apparent from the account given above that the canteens organisa-tion in India has hitherto concerned itself with the procurement, distribution and sale of goods, rather than with amenities. These are left to be provided by the contractors who are often reluctant to do more in this direction than they are
obliged, and in any case are generally not qualified to know what British troopsappreciate. - In consequence canteens are often dismal and dreary.The remedy lies to some extent with commanding officers, who can bring pressure to bear on and explain requirements to contractors. But in my view thebest means of securing brighter and cleaner canteens is to introduce supervisionby women to the maximum possible extent.34. I have been informed that an agreement has now been reached betweenthe military authorities and the contractors which should result in very consider-able improvements in the services provided. The contractors are to be treated as military agents, which will enable them to make use of military supplies and stores. Hostesses wall be introduced, and Sergeant Supervisors belonging to thecanteen services will tour regularly to inspect and give advice. I consider thatthis scheme deserves every encouragement, and that the new arrangementscontemplated should be brought into effect without delay.Beer.35. Although the indigenous production of beer in India has increased by over 300 per cent., it is not adequate to provide for the requirements of british personnel nor indeed to supply the present ration of 3 bottles per man per month.36. I have enquired into the possibilities of expanding Indian production,but I am satisfied that it is impossible to secure an adequate supply of good beerby this means. Moreover Indian beer does not travel well in casks, and no beerbottles manufactured in India can stand up to the internal pressure generatedby the pasteurisation of beer. I understand that it has recently been agreed topool the exportable surplus of British brewed, beer between NAAFI andIndia, and in addition orders have been placed for 160,000 dozen quart bottlesof American beer. Neither of these contracts, however, will suffice to meet therequirements of British personnel, and possibilities of further import, particularly for the 14th Army area, must be explored. Further importation is the onlyremedy for the existing shortage.37. Experiments in the production of a beer or &quot;beery beverage&quot; that can be made in the forward areas have recently taken place. A number of difficulties have been met but a form of portable brewery has now been evolvedin which a type of beer acceptable to troops can be brewed. Two sets of this equipment stationed at Imphal and Comilla are now under going tests in fieldservice conditions. Further equipment can be made available if the experimentsprove satisfactory.38. Another attempt to make up for the shortage of beer by the developmentof substitutes has resulted in the production of &quot; Cydrale.&quot; This drink hasan alcoholic content in excess of indigenous beer and is priced at 7 annas perbottle retail plus any Provincial duty. One factory is operating in Bombayand production has risen from 1,910 dozen bottles in August 1943 to 11,660 dozenbottles in October 1944, which indicates its popularity with troops. although this experiment may be reckoned a success it does not lessen the need for furtherimportation of beer.Postal and Telegraph facilities.39. Letters can now be despatched to the United Kingdom in a number of ways, but the &quot;Air Letter,&quot; which seems to be the most popular, costs 4 annas.Airgraph letters cost 3 annas, and there is a further service called &quot; Ordair,&quot;which also travels by air throughout and costs 8 annas. Lastly, there is theordinary free letter sent &quot; On Active Service,&quot; which goes by sea.40. &apos;&apos; Expeditionary Force Message &apos;&apos; telegrams are sent by cable or radiofrom England to Bombay at the cost of 2s. Qd. per telegram. On receipt in Indiathese telegrams are sent to the Base Postal Depot, Bombay, which addresses themto the correct location in India. The telegrams are then forwarded by post as the posts and Telegraph Department of. the Government of India have insufficientfacilities to transmit them by wire.41. So far as the letter services are concerned, I believe that they aregenerally satisfactory, though any improvements that could be made in thedirection of greater speed, reduced cost or increased &apos;&apos; ration&apos;&apos; would be welcomed. The E.F.M. telegram service takes longer than an air letter, and thisbelies the whole object of the service. If delivery cannot be accelerated and[28799] d 2
the possibilities of doing so might be re-examined it would mitigate criticism if the present defects of the service were explained to all who propose to use it.Otherwise people assume that a telegram is quicker than a letter, which in this case is not so.42. I heard a number of complaints about pilfering of parcels, particu-larly those containing cigarettes. Pilfering is liable to occur anywhere, and i could not establish where the main source of the trouble lay. In any case, it isnecessary that all possible safeguards should be adopted at every stage to ensurethat parcels reach the troops untampered with and in good condition. I anisatisfied that the packing arrangements at home are now suitable, and I am informed that the Army Postal authorities propose to introduce a registrationscheme for parcels in transit through India which should be in operation byJanuary next. I hope that these measures will reduce pilfering to the minimum,and I am confident that the authorities concerned are fully alive to the necessityof constant vigilance.43. A purchase tax has recently been levied in the United Kingdom upongift parcels sent home by British troops in India, and I have found that thereasons for the imposition of this tax are not understood by British troops, whoalso question the need for the existing limitation on the size and cost of parcels.Comparison is constantly made with the size of the parcels which are allowed to be sent from India by American personnel and which are delivered in the United States free of all forms of import duty. It is desirable that thereasons for the restrictions placed on British troops in these respects should be explained to them.ENSA and &quot;Live&apos;&apos;&apos; Entertainment.44. ENS A has been operating in India since November 1943 and is nowresponsible for the provision of all &apos;&apos; live &apos;&apos; entertainment for British troops, ftbegan in a small way, and is still unable to meet requirements; a large proportionof the troops have seen very few, if any, ENSA shows during their period ofservice in India. This is, of course, due. to the fact that artists have not beencoming to India in sufficient numbers, and I need not elaborate the criticisms onthis score which are voiced everywhere.45. It is necessary to stimulate a continuous flow of artists from the UnitedKingdom, and I trust that this will now be possible. Visits from star performerswould be particularly appreciated by the troops, and it would facilitate these ifair passages could be assured. Tours in India must be fairly long, so as to allow of playing in the forward areas, where &quot; live &quot; entertainment is particularlywelcome and desirable.46. ENSA is shortly to take over the organisation of the BengalEntertainment Services Association, commonly called &apos;&apos; Besa,&apos;&apos; which came into being as a voluntary effort in June 1942 and has done valuable work in the EasternProvinces of India and behind the forward troops.47. Besides the activities of ENSA, every encouragement is given to units to provide their own entertainment, and these unit parties, besides their value asentertainment &quot; on the night,&quot; provide recreation and employment in the making of stages, scenery, &amp;c.48. A point that calls for attention is the paucity of bands in India.Martial music played by military bands is a rarity instead of being heardeverywhere, as it should be, and there is room for many more bands. I understandthat some units have instruments but no musicians;&apos; efforts are being made tosupply them with musicians from reinforcements where possible. On the otherhand, there is a considerable amount of musical talent available among Britishtroops generally, but a shortage of instruments. This is another deficiency whichcan only be made good by importation.49. The needs of Indian troops are catered for by an organisation quitedistinct from, but analogous to, ENSA, known as the Fauji Dilkhush Sabha (orEDS for short). This has now been in operation for just over six months andis now running 22 parties in India, 1 in Ceylon, 1 in Italy, 3 in Mideast and2 in Paiforce. From all reports their performances are very popular and the mainneed is for more parties.
Cinemas.50.   There are three types of cinemas serving troops in India and South-east asia Commands to-day ; i(a) Camp Cinemas (Static) are run by contractors working on a standardcontract prepared by the Q.M.G. The prices for admission, which are agreed between the parties, vary from 8 annas to Rs. 1/8/-. There are many complaints that the films shown are old and the prices chargedtoo high. There can be little doubt that the contractors are makinglarge profits and that the films are often in bad condition. It has now&apos; been agreed that the newly appointed Director of ServicesKinematography should be responsible for all these contracts infuture, and no new contracts will be made or old ones renewed if thenecessary equipment is available to take over.the Contractors&apos; Cinema.(&amp;) R.A.F. Static Cinemas of which there are 15 in operation are showingreasonably up-to-date films. These cinemas are well run and very fewcomplaints are made. Charges for admission are similar to the CampCinemas. In addition the R.A.F. use 50 per cent, of the projectorssupplied for training and operational film exhibition for entertain-ment purposes.  Admission to this type of show is free.(c) Mobile Cinema Units are run by the D.S.K. Throughout India andSouth-East Asia Commands only 28 are in operation to-day.51. No cinema projectors are manufactured in India to-day, and the onlysources of supply are the United Kingdom and the United States. I have beeninformed that the output at home is 150 projectors a month, and that this output is allocated by the Ministry of Supply in conjunction with an Allocation Com-mittee&quot; composed of the representatives of the three services and ENSA. for reasons of which I am unaware the total number of projectors received in india during the last 5 months has amounted to 24 only. The requirements of India,if one show is to be given to each man every nine days, have been worked out as1,319 16-mm. projectors and 446 35-mm. projectors.52. Copies of 35-mm. films are now coming forward and should keepabreast of requirements. A considerable quantity of new Anglo-American and indian films are now in circulation and very few complaints have been receivedabout the films shown on Mobile Cinema Units. Unfortunately the positionof the 16-mm. films is not so favourable, but all possible efforts are being madeto speed up supply.Wireless and Broadcasting.53. Good broadcast programmes are of great importance as entertainmentand as a &quot;means of sustaining morale. Four programmes are available for troopsin India  (1) The General Forces Programme of the B.B.C. I am informed that this cannot be heard everywhere, except on the best sets.(2) The ordinary programme of All-India Radio. This contains only asmall proportion of items designed for European tastes and, whileit meets the needs of Indian troops, is not listened to by British troops.(3) A special forces programme arranged by General Headquarters (India)and radiated by All-India Radio, who are however, only able owingto their many commitments, to allot 30 hours of air time a week tothis service.(4) In some centres, programmes radiated by local small-power stations put up by the Americans to serve their own troops.54. In my opinion the programmes available are not sufficient to meet requirements. For the reasons given above, the B.B.C. and A.I.R. broadcastsdo not provide adequate programmes throughout the hours at which troops want to listen. The position can only be improved by the provision of more programmesproduced and radiated in India specially for British troops. If, as I believe,the A.I.R. transmitters cannot be made available to a much greater extent than they are at present, additional transmitters reserved exclusively for broad-casts to ithe troops would be required, and if they can be provided within areasonable time I would recommend their installation.
55. The best programmes will, however, be wasted unless receiving sets areavailable in sufficient numbers. There is, at present, a very great shortage of receiving sets. They are not procurable in India, and it is urgently necessarythat large numbers of sets should be imported at the earliest possible moment.Philanthrvpic and Voluntary Organisations.56. A great deal is being done for troops in India by voluntary effort, andbesides the work of the Red Cross for sick and wounded, the Y.M.C.A. Toe H,the Salvation Army, the Y.W.C.A. and similar organisations are all givingvaluable assistance, mainly by the provision of hostels and canteens. The Women/sVoluntary Services (India) also undertakes a number of activities for the welfare of troops. It would take much space to enumerate the many directions in whichall these bodies are giving much appreciated service to the troops, and I wouldconfine myself to two observations. First, there is still a very wide scope for development of their work, and I&apos; hope that more and more of their energies willbe devoted to this theatre of war. Second, the chief difficulty which almost all,I believe, of the organisations in the field have to encounter is a deficiency ofstaff. They require assistance in obtaining the release of personnel from the.United Kingdom and in bringing them out without delay to India. any assistance that can be given to them in these ways will, I am sure, be repaid withan ample dividend by the results of their endeavours.[I am not in a position to judge whether European women in India are fully employed in war work. In some places I have visited the general opinion wasthat the majority are doing all they can, but in other places there is a difference of opinion on this point. The Registration of Women now proceeding shouldthrow further light on this question. Whatever conclusion may be reached,however, it is certain that the number of European women is absolutelyinadequate to fill all the posts for which English women are required. A furtherimportant point which should not be lost sight of is that most of the womenhave already done a long period in India without returning home and the majoritywill undoubtedly return to England the moment they can. There are acomparatively small number of women now- at home who desire to rejoin their husbands in India, but even if they all came and immediately took up war worktheir presence could not appreciably alter the position.I can see no alternative than to bringing out a large number from homewilling and qualified to do the work involved.]Medical Services.57. The Medical Services in India and South-East Asia Commands havehad to cope with conditions which are unique in Army Medical history. Malaria,dysentery and typhus are rife in the Assam-Burma area, in which most of thebattles have been fought and our forces have been spread out over a very extensivefront with poor communications. Hence the establishment of an adequate medicalorganisation has been particularly difficult. However, many of the. obstaclesexperienced in early days have been overcome and I am satisfied from all I have seen that the medical facilities are maintained at a high standard of efficiency.58. There are, however, certain directions in which improvements can stillbe made, but all these improvements depend in the main upon a steady and continuous flow of imports. There is a shortage of electrical plant and fittings,particularly air-conditioning plant for operating theatres and a general shortageof refrigerators, fans and fly-proof netting. All these are necessities in theclimatic conditions of India and I am assured that the demand cannot be met from Indian sources.59. The medical officers and matrons of all the hospitals I visited impressed upon me the need for substituting iron-beds for charpoys wherever they exist.I am unaware of the number of iron-beds required but every effort should be&quot; madeto wipe out the existing deficiency.60. A small number of drugs are in short supply but these are all drugsof which there is at present a world shortage. The manufacture of surgicalinstruments in India has not reached expectations and demands have had to beplaced for a wider range of articles from the United Kingdom, which are now coming forward in increasing numbers. Considerable quantities of stores were lost in shipment and these losses have been made up only after some unavoidabledelay.
61. It came to my notice in the course of my tour that the serving and preperation of food for patients was open to some criticism. There werecomplaints that food was insufficient in quantity and quality and served in anunappetising way. From further enquiries I have made I am satisfied that thefood is sufficient in quantity and quality but the arrangements for cooking andserving require to be improved. In the kitchens of most hospitals a Britishsoldier trained in the Army School of Cookery has to superintend a number ofIndian cooks, who unless constantly watched are likely to depart from thehighest standards of hygiene. This difficulty could be met if more trainedBritish cooks could be sent from the United Kingdom. This would go fartowards ensuring that the food was cooked and served in a more palatablemanner. A number of trained catering supervisors from the Army CateringCorps are in or en route to India and their services will be invaluable, but many more are required.&apos;62. There is a shortage of medical staff in India which in view of other commitments has not yet been possible for the home authorities to meet. Theseshortages extend to Medical Officers particularly of specialist category such assurgeons and trained nurses, who are the frame work around which all goodhospital administration must be built. It is hoped that the situation may shortlyimprove and many of the existing staff shortages alleviated. The 250 V.A.D.nurses who volunteered for service in India have now been distributed in batchesof 15 to 20 to Combined Field Base Hospitals, where they are nursing both Britishand Indian wounded, and the services they have rendered have received thehighest praise from Medical Officers and matrons who would welcome an additionto their numbers. Great help could be given by further importation of a numberof V.A.Ds., but they must be balanced by a sufficient number of trained sisters to supervise their work.Conclusion.63. I have drawn attention in the body of my report to the main matters which appear to me to require immediate attention and I shall not repeat therecommendations and suggestions which I have already made but for convenienceI have summarised them in an appendix.64. The report is necessarily concerned chiefly with the lack of amenities and suggestions for the provision of more but it should not be inferred that themilitary authorities have not been alive to the needs of the situation. It mustbe remembered that India had to be built up from small beginnings into a largemilitary base and operational projects had to be given first priority. Justifiableand indeed inevitable as this policy was, however, I believe that the time hasnow come to step up the provision of all amenities. The resources of India bothin man-power and materials have long been stretched to the utmost and havenever sufficed to meet all calls made upon them. If this stepping up is to beachieved, therefore, there must be an increasing flow of men and material fromthe United Kingdom to meet welfare requirements. This is the outstandingfact impressed upon me by all I have seen and heard throughout my tour.(Signed) MUNSTER.November, 1944.APPENDIX.Recommendations.1.
