THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,   December 1944,SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 711.7th December, 1944-WAR CABINET.PRIZE MONEY AND PRIZE BOUNTY.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.IN paragraph 4 of his memorandum W.P. (44) 700 of the 22nd November, 1944,.on war gratuity for the Armed Forces the Chancellor of the Exchequer statesthat he would like to see the announcement regarding war gratuity coupled withan announcement that prize money will not be payable, at any rate to individualseamen, and that at the same time prize bounty should be declared obsolete.2. I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to the following facts.Prize money is provided for by statute and until the law is changed naval personnel have a right to expect this payment where the appropriate service has been given. It has not fallen into desuetude, having been in operation in living memory in the last War, and it is still brought publicly to the notice ofofficers and men from time to time by a reference to it in the Articles of War.Men who have signed long-term engagements between Wars know that prizemoney is a perquisite of the Fleet in war time. Many pensioners who have beenrecalled and who have served so well remember the grant of prize money afterthe last War. The denial of prize money is an authorized punishment underthe Naval Discipline Act.3. In view of these facts I believe that any decision that there was to beno prize money in the present&apos; War would be regarded by the Fleet as a breach of faith by His Majesty&apos;s Government.4. Proper distinction can be made, in my opinion and that of my advisers,between Prize Money and Prize Bounty. It is true that the latter is also provided for by statute and is referred to in conjunction -with Prize money in the Articles of War, but it is also true that Prize Bounty, unlike Prize Money,has very little significance for the men of the Fleet and is relatively very smallin amount. Moreover, Prize Bounty, unlike Prize Money which is a droit of theCrown, is a payment from monies voted by Parliament. Finally, it would be exceedingly difficult in the conditions of this War to arrive at a fully correctassessment of Prize Bounty, which is based upon an exact knowledge of thecomplements of enemy ships.5. I do not agree that payment of Prize Money would create undesirableinequalities between man and man. It has nothing in common with war gratuity.Prize money entails no payment out of revenue, but merely the distribution of a fund created by the services of those to whom it is distributed. Because theArmy cannot earn Prize Money it does not in any way follow that the Navy&apos;seligibility, in common with the Army, for a war gratuity based on entirely different factors should prejudice the traditional right to prize money. I mayadd that the amount available for distribution is likely to be very much lessthan in the last War.6. The War Cabinet decided in March 1940 (W.M. (40) 80th Conclusions,Minute 8) that the decision in regard to prize money and prize bounty should,if possible, be deferred for consideration at the end of the War, with the cort-sideration of gratuities in respect of war service generally.   The arguments[28772]
which led to this conclusion apply equally now, because the amount of prize money available for distribution and the amount of prize money earned cannot be knownuntil the end of hostilities with Japan.7. The Dominion Navies doubtless have the same expectation of grants or prize money and prize bounty as the Royal Navy, as they shared in the last war, and the Dominion Governments would need to be consulted before any decision is reached.8. At the present time a large part of the Fleet is facing the unpleasantprospect of transfer to the Far East and further separation from home and families after an arduous &apos;and already prolonged War. We are doing all in our power to mitigate the difficulties of this transfer. I cannot imagine a moreinopportune moment at which to take an unfavourable or unsatisfactory decision,which clearly I could not keep from the Fleet, in this matter of prize money.A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1,Qth December, 1944.
