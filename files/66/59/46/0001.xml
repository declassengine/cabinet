E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18th December, 1944.ANNEX.&apos;Message to the Prime Minister from Dr. Weizmann.*I am deeply grateful for the consideration you have shown to our causeand for your personal reference to me. I fully realise the gravity of the situation.Our co-operation with the authorities in stamping out terrorism is proceeding satisfactorily. 500 names of suspects have already been supplied to the policeas a result of which over 250 have been arrested. Effective co-operation has beentendered also in other forms. It is, of course, impossible to venture any forecastsin dealing with secret organisations, but it is confidently believed that severeblows have already been dealt to them and there is every determination to perseverewith the campaign until decisive results are achieved. We can only do our best.The assassination of Lord Moyne has caused abhorrence and violent resentmentamongst all sections of the Jewish public which is helping in tracing suspects,resisting extortions and morally isolating the terrorist group. The impositionof sanctions by the Government on the Jewish community as a whole, especiallyin the matter of immigration and at a time when reports pour in daily of continued slaughter of Jews in enemy-occupied Europe and acute suffering inits liberated parts, would have a disastrous effect on Jewish feeling; mightrender more difficult the anti-terrorist campaign, and generally cause irreparableharm. I am confident that you will appreciate the complexity of the issue andassure your colleagues that the situation is being energetically dealt with as faras we are concerned and that we hope and pray that nothing will happen whichwould aggravate it.* Received in telegram from Palestine No. HC/1659 of the 8th December.[28852]
