THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AW SIC MAJE.STY&apos;S G O YERNMpNTPrinted for the War Cabinet,   December 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 723.11th December, 1944WAR CABINET.CONSULTATION WITH THE EUROPEAN ALLIED GOVERNMENTSABOUT THE INSTRUMENT  OF  SURRENDER  OF  GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE European Advisory Commission, at a recent meeting, decided that theChairman of the Commission (M. Gousev at present holds that office) should address a letter to the European Allied Governments saying that the commission would be glad to arrange for the representatives of those Governments to meet with a Committee of the Commission in order to receive information about the instrument of Surrender of Germany prepared by the Commission, and to discuss with the Committee any matters of special concern to those Governments inconnexion with this question.2. The intention is that representatives of the European Allied Govern-ments shall be received severally by the Committee. The Committee will, as a first step, communicate to them a summary of the Instrument of Surrender. Itis my view, and the members of the Commission have been so informed, that theEuropean Allied Governments should receive the actual text of the instrument of Surrender some time before its presentation to the Germans; but for thepresent it is thought better, for reasons of security, to communicate only asummary, the text of which has been approved by the European advisory commission.3. A complication has arisen in connexion with the proposed communication of this summary to a representative of the Polish Government in London. TheSoviet representative has objected to the despatch of a letter from the Com--mission to the Polish Government and to the reception of a Polish representativeby the Committee. In view of this I have proposed that the Foreign Office should conduct with the Polish Government, outside the Commission, the samemeasure of consultation as the Commission will conduct with the other allied Governments through its Committee. The Soviet representativehas objected even to this, on the ground that the records of some of themembers of the Polish Government in London are such that the communi-cation to the Polish Government of any information about the Instrument, of surrender would create a serious risk of the disclosure of such information to theenemy. It is also the view of the Soviet representative that the governments represented on the Commission should not communicate information about the instrument of Surrender to any other Government except by common consent.4. The principle that the Governments represented on the commission should consult each other, and if possible obtain consent, before communicatinginformation about the proceedings of the Commission to other governments is on the whole a sound one. I see no prospect of obtaining the consent of theSoviet Government to the communication of such information to the PolishGovernment in London. Since, in view of recent events, our relations with thepresent Polish Government are not of the same intimacy or confidence as thosewe maintained with their predecessors, I should be inclined not to make any communication to them about the Instrument of Surrender in the face of the expressed Soviet objection, and to acquiesce in the withholding from them, forthe present at any rate, of information on this subject.A.
