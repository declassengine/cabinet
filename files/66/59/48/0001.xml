(44) 748.18th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER.-Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production,IN Section III of W.P. (44) 718 the Minister of Labour and National Servicegives estimates of the numbers which the Supply Departments may expect to release during 1945, assuming that the German war is over by the 30th June, 1945,and in a footnote on page 3 of that Memorandum it is stated that theestimates have been agreed by the Joint War Production Staff on the basis ofJ.W.P.S. (44) 38.2. Mention is not made, however, of the conditional nature of the estimatesgiven in J.W.P.S. (44) 38, and I think that my colleagues should be warned thatit would be unsafe to assume that, so far as the aircraft industry is concerned,these higher estimates will be realised. Since the estimated releases from this industry account for about 80 per cent, of the total for the first half of the yearand for about 60 per cent, of the total for the whole year, it is extremely important that there should be no misapprehension on this point.3. The aircraft programme at present in operation is that which was approved by the War Cabinet on the 16th October, 1944 (W.M. (44) 138th Con-clusions). This programme -covers the period to the 30th June, 1946, and preliminary estimates of the labour force required to meet it were given inparagraph 5 of W.P. (44) 572. These estimates contrast with the figures assumed in W.P. (44) 718 in the following manner : Estimated releases Releasesunder the estimatedapproved aircraft for theprogramme purpose of w.P. (44) 572. W.P. (44) 718.1st half of 1945      ...       ... 400,000 523,0002nd half of 1945     ...      ... 30,000 200,000Total, 1945 ...... 430,000 723,0004. The estimates appearing in J.W.P.S. (44) 38, on which the Minister ofLabour has based his calculations, were given at the request of the Minister ofProduction merely as a broad guide to those responsible for reconversion plans,assuming that certain changes in the aircraft programme under discussion at thetime would take place. They were not based on any programme that enjoyedCabinet authority, nor, indeed, on any programme that had been accepted by theAir Ministry and Admiralty as meeting their requirements for Stage 2. In thesecircumstances, unless the Admiralty and the Air Ministry were preparedimmediately to agree a new programme as resulting from the lease-lendagreements in America, it would be unwise to act on the assumption that a greater number could be released than is shown in W.P. (44) 572, particularly during thefirst half of the year.R. S. C.Ministry of Aircraft Production, S.W. 1,18th December., 1944.[28856]
