THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  December 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 738.lQth December, 1944WAR CABINET.INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF COLONIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Armistice and Post-War Committee.1. In the memorandum prepared by the United States Government as abasis for discussion at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference reference was made to&quot; territorial trusteeship,&quot; though the chapter dealing with this subject was leftblank with an indication that papers would be circulated later. In fact, no suchpaper was circulated, nor was the subject raised officially during the Conference.A number of informal talks took place, however, between members of the UnitedKingdom Delegation and the State Department, at the last of which mr. Pasvolsky suggested a preliminary exchange of papers between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom and the United States Government coveringparticularly (a) the general outline of what he termed &quot; trusteeship machinery,&quot;(b) the future of the present Mandates, and (c) the development of Regionalmachinery and its relation, if any, to the World Organisation^2. I now circulate a memorandum prepared as a basis for discussion by theSecretary of State for the Colonies with a view to its eventual communicationfor that purpose to the State Department. The draft of this memorandum! wasconsidered by the Armistice and Post-War Committee at&apos; their meeting on the14th December, when the Committee approved it for submission to the WarCabinet, subject to certain amendments which have been incorporated in the textnow circulated. The policy suggested follows fairly closely that described in thememorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on &quot; InternationalRegional Bodies in Colonial Areas;; special attention is, however, invited to part III, and in particular paragraphs 25 and 26.3. It is essential that before any document of this kind is communicatedto the State Department the views of the Dominion Governments should be ascertained. The War Cabinet are already aware of the discussions which tookplace at the Australia-New Zealand Conference in Wellington last month, as aresult of which public statements were made by those Governments on regional commissions and on international supervision of Colonies. If, therefore, theWar Cabinet give general approval to the memorandum, we suggest that it shouldbe sent to Dominion Governments at the earliest possible date with a request forcomments by telegram. When those comments have been received, the documentwould again be submitted to the War Cabinet for final approval in the light ofDominion Governments&apos; comments before it is given to the United states authorities.(Initialled) C.

INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF COLONIAL POLICYANALYSIS OF CONTENTS.Paragraph 1.Paragraphs 2-3.Paragraphs 4-6.Part I. The Objective of Colonial Policy.   (Para-graphs 1 to 6.)The size of the problem.The test of any international machinery for dealing with it is whether it will promote to the utmost the well-being of thecolonial peoples within the world community--the Britishconception of &apos;&apos; trusteeship &apos;&apos; is now too static and is givingplace to &quot;partnership.&quot;Sound colonial policy implies (i) development of self-government; (ii) economic and social advancement; (iii) recog-nition of the responsibility due from members of the world community one to another. These implications arecomplementary.Paragraphs 8-10.Paragraph 11.Paragraph 12.Paragraph 13.Paragraphs 14-13.Paragraph 16.Paragraphs 17-18.Paragraph 19.Part II.

Measures to Ensure Publicity in colonial administration.   (Paragraphs 20 to 26.)Full publicity is an essential of good government anywhere;but the peculiar circumstances of dependent territories have ledmany thinkers to advocate the doctrine of accountability to international opinion. The difficulty.of reconciling this doctinewith that of sovereignty is analysed.Nevertheless, the publication of annual reports inconformity with an internationally agreed model is not opento this objection and should be an obligation on all colonial powers.The scope of the reports should be determined by anInternational Colonial Centre, which would receive copies of allthe reports published and collate material at its disposal. TheCentre would be an integral part of the World organisation under the aegis of a Sub-Committee of the Economic and social council, composed of representatives of all Colonial Powersplus a number of others chosen by the General Assembly, whichwould be able to discuss international aspects of questions arising out of the Centre&apos;s work.
Paragraphs 27-28.Paragraphs 29-31.Part IV. Mandated Territories and italian colonies.   (Paragraphs 27 to 31.)The origin and purpose of the Mandate system.Its weaknesses : the scheme described in Parts II and IIIis wider and more flexible and should replace the mandate system. The new general system should also apply to ex-enemy territory after the war. It is undesirable to create different kinds of international status for the various dependent territories. They should all be brought into line with thegeneral system propounded in this Memorandum.Paragraph 32.Part V. Summary of Conclusions.I. The Objective of Colonial Policy.1. In any discussion of post-war international organisation, one of the subjects to which public attention throughout the world will be directed is thefuture of colonial peoples and the creation of appropriate arrangements to ensureinternational co-operation in the solution of this problem. Some indication ofits immensity is afforded by the figures given below* :-Area of Colonies,Protectorates and.   &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot;. mandated territories inSq.

The test by which any such arrangements should be examined is a simpleone which can be stated quite briefly. It is, whether or not they will help in achieving the objective of. good colonial administration, which is to promoteto the utmost the well-being of colonial peoples within the world community.This objective has long been recognised in the colonial policy of Great Britainwho has set herself to follow those principles which should guide a trustee inthe discharge of his duties. , The analogy of &quot; trusteeship &quot; was a convenientway of summing up this essential feature of British colonial policy, but it wasnot thought of as carrying with it any implication that Parliament was account-able to any third party. The conception of trusteeship in this sense has beenreaffirmed by successive British Governments; for example in the &quot;Statementof Policy on Colonial Development and Welfare &quot; issued in 1940 : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are trustees for the well-being of the peoples of the Colonial Empire. . . . The primary aim of colonial policy is to protectand advance the interests of the inhabitants.&quot;3. In recent years, however, doubts have grown up whether the attitudeof mind reflected in the use of the word &apos;&apos; trusteeship &apos;&apos; sufficiently recognises* These figures taken from &quot;The Colonial Problem&quot; (Oxford University Press, 1937)exclude the two remaining &quot;A&quot; Mandated Territories, viz., Palestine and&apos; Trans-Jordan(British) and Syria and Lebanon (French). The United Kingdom figures, however, include the self-governing Colony of Southern Rhodesia.
the changing relationship between Great Britain, and her colonial peoples resultingfrom the increasing part which they are taking in the task of planning and promoting their own welfare and progress. &quot; Trusteeship &quot; has now, therefore,been largely superseded by &quot; partnership &quot;-a term which is felt to interpretmore correctly the outlook of the colonial peoples themselves towards the presentphase of their political evolution within the British Commonwealth of Nations.The constitutions in many territories in the British Colonial Empire alreadyprovide for a wide measure of control by the local Legislature over the affairs ofthe territory; and there is a continuing progress in this direction.4. It has been stated above that the objective of good colonial administration is to promote to the utmost the well-being of colonial peoples within the world community. So far as Great Britain is concerned, this objective may be taken as implying :-(i) the development of self-government within the British commonwealth in forms appropriate to the varying circumstances of colonial peoples;(ji) their economic and social advancement; and(iii) recognition of the responsibilities due from members of the world community one to another.These implications are complementary though they have not at all times receivedequal recognition in colonial administration. The close- interrelation betweenpolitical, social and economic progress has recently been re-emphasised by theSecretary of State for the Colonies* : &quot; If self-government is to succeed it has to have solid social and economicfoundations, and although without them spectacular political advances may drawfor the authors the plaudits of the superficial, they will bring to those whom it is designed to benefit nothing but disaster .... if we are to be true to our pledge,if we really mean as soon as practicable to -develop self-government in these territories, it is up to us to see that circumstances as soon as possible justifypolitical advances and to ensure that as quickly as possible people are trained and equipped for eventual self-government. The real test is ... . not only theactual political advances that we make but it is also, and I think more important,the steps that we are taking, economic and social as well as political, to prepare the people for further and future responsibilities.&quot;5. The promotion of economic and social development carries with it a positive obligation on the part of the Parent State to provide financial, as well as other, assistance to its dependent territories where their own resources are insufficient. Great Britain gave statutory recognition to this principle in theColonial Development and Welfare Act of 1940, which made available  5,500,000per annum over a period of ten years for research, development and welfare inthe Colonies, and remitted earlier loans from His Majesty&apos;s Government to thevalue of some  10 million. Legislation will shortly be introduced to prolong theperiod covered by this Act, and will increase substantially the provision of fundsauthorised to be made under it.6. Nevertheless, in the pursuit of this objective, the Parent State must bemindful of its international obligations in such matters as defence and good-neighbourliness in social, economic and commercial policy : it must not, even forthe apparent benefit of its colonial peoples, order its colonial policy any morethan its home policy to the detriment of good international relations. At thesame time proper development of the resources of colonial (as indeed of other)territories is a duty to the world no less than to the inhabitants themselves.II A Scheme for Future International Collaboration.V. In order to achieve the objectives of sound colonial policy as defined inPart I of this memorandum, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomrecommend the adoption of a general system of international collaboration (A) on a regional basis through Regional Commissions, and(B) by the creation of further central functional bodies, such as the Inter-national Labour Organisation, attached to the World Organisation.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom believe also that fullpublicity is an important factor in the attainment of a progressive policy. Thissubject is treated separately in Part III of this Memorandum.* House of Commons Official Report, 13th July, 1943.
(A) Regional Commissions.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have already announced in Parliament that they would welcome the establishment of machinery which will enable common problems which transcend the boundaries of politicalunits to be discussed and solved by common efforts. As the Secretary of State forthe Colonies said in the House of Commons on the 13th July, 1943 : &apos;&apos; Developments of modern transport and modern communications have brought close together vast areas which before were widely separated. Manyof their problems to-day are common problems and can only be solved inco-operation, for problems of security, of transport, of economics, of health,&amp;c, transcend the boundaries of political units. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould therefore welcome the establishment of machinery which will enablesuch problems to be discussed and to be solved by common efforts. What theyhave in mind is the possibility of establishing Commissions for certainregions. These Commissions would comprise not only the States withColonial Territories in the region, but also other States which have in the region a major strategic or economic interest. While each State would remain responsible for the administration of its own territory, such aCommission would provide effective and permanent machinery for consul-tation and collaboration so that the States concerned might work together to promote the well-being of the Colonial territories. An important consideration in designing the machinery of each Commission will be to give to the people of the Colonial territories in the region an opportunity to be associated with its work.&quot; In this way it would be possible to have international co-operation which consisted of something more than theoretical discussion but would beable to grapple with realities and get down to the solution of individualproblems.&quot;-9. In the promotion, under modern conditions, of that social and economic development which, as stated in paragraphs 4 and 5 above, is fundamental togood Colonial administration, there are many problems which in many parts ofthe world cannot be solved by one government working in isolation from its neigh-bours and the creation of Regional Commissions, wherever geographicalcircumstances require, seems to afford the best method of contributing to theirsolution. Such Commissions are the most fruitful way of ensuring the collabora-tion of governments in the formulation of regional policy on such matters as, forexample, public health control, movements of labour within the region, regional economic problems and local communications, food and agriculture, and research.In formulating such policies it would be necessary for the Regional commissions to have regard to the wider requirements of world policy. Many of the subjectswith which they deal will no doubt fall within the scope, of specialised inter-national agencies and it will be most important that such agencies should work inclose association with the Regional Commissions. In many cases, indeed, the agency might find it useful to establish a regional branch for this purpose.10. The areas in which Regional Commissions could usefully be formed are considered in paragraph 13 below. Their precise machinery and compositionwill naturally vary according to the circumstances of the region. The system should be flexible and should be allowed to grow to meet the needs of the regionas revealed progressively by practical experience of its working. It would be a mistake to attempt to lay down rigid rules in advance, but certain requirements will be common to them all: (a) A permanent secretariat, at a suitable headquarters within the regiondrawn from the various countries represented on the Commission.(&amp;) Local representatives of the territories concerned should be closely-associated with the work of the Commissions wherever practicable,either by inclusion on the Commissions themselves, or in conferencesheld under the auspices of the Commissions.(c) Copies of all official reports and other publications relating to the terri-tories in the region should be supplied to the Regional Commission.(d) The Regional Commission itself will no doubt publish from time to timereports on its own proceedings and on any general matters of publicinterest affecting the region as a whole.(e) The Regional Commission should work in close association with similarneighbouring bodies and with any specialised international agenciesconcerned
(/) The Regional representatives of each Government included in the Regionwould naturally have every opportunity to arrange, in consultationwith the other Governments concerned, visits to the various territories in the Region, in order to familiarise themselves with conditions there.11. The proposed Commissions, which would be composed of representativesof the member Governments, would be consultative bodies not themselvesexercising any executive or supervisory powers as Commissions. There are several reasons why this is necessary. First, a number of the regions will includesovereign States as well as dependent areas. Secondly, many British colonial territories are already politically so far advanced that the exercise of executiveor supervisory powers by an outside body would be deeply resented by the local inhabitants and would, in any event, become more and more impracticable asfurther measures of self-government are realised. Dependent status should beregarded as a transitional stage of political evolution, and any measure whichmight tend to suggest that it is permanent should be avoided. Thirdly, many ofthe members of the Commission would have no responsibility for carrying out adecision in a particular territory. The divorce of power and responsibilityimplied in the exercise of executive functions by a Regional Commission wouldresult in a form of dyarchy that could only give rise to confusion and friction.12. The Regional Commissions should not concern themselves with the purely constitutional issue of the development of self-government, i.e., with theconstitutional relationship between a Colony and its Parent State.; It is very doubtful whether any outside body could offer any useful advice in the matter.The Permanent Mandates Commission itself experienced this difficulty whenthe termination of the Mandate for Iraq was under consideration. Judgmentmust be based on long practical experience of the particular circumstances and capacity of the people of the territory in question for further measures of self-government. On the other hand, there will be many valuable lessons to be learnedfrom the experience of different Administrations in their handling of problemsof local Government and native administration, and in their efforts to resolvethe conflicts of interest which arise in territories with plural communities.13. Possible Regions. The geographical area of a Region might includetwo categories of territory, namely (a) Dependent territories in the Region.(b) Independent States in the Region.Further, there may often be (c) Independent States outside the Region (other than Parent States) whohave a major strategic or economic interest in the Region and aretherefore represented on the Commission.It does not, of course, necessarily follow that representatives of all three of these categories would be found on every Regional Commission.(1) The Caribbean.The Anglo-American Caribbean Commission is the only Regional Commissionyet set up and its scope so far is limited to the British Colonies and the UnitedStates Possessions within the Caribbean area. It has, however, already begun to widen its scope through the medium of the bodies which function under itsauspices. For instance, at the West Indian Conference held in March 1944, inaddition to the territories mentioned above, Canada and the Netherlands west indies were represented by one observer each; the French National Committeeof Liberation was unable to accept an invitation to send an observer. It. seems clear that any expansion of the scope of the Commission itself should immediatelytake in the dependent territories of France and Holland, and at the same time it might be desirable to invite Canada to join the Commission in view of her economic ties with the British Colonies in the Caribbean. Ultimately thereshould be machinery to enable the problems of the Caribbean area to be considered as a whole by the inclusion of the independent republics of Cuba, Haiti and SantoDomingo, and possibly some of the South and Central American Republics. Theimmediate addition of the independent republics, however, would complicate theworking of the Commission proper and even of the West Indian Conference and reduce their present effectiveness.
(2) The South Pacific.The geographical area of this Region might include all the island territoriesSouth of Latitude 23 North (but excluding the islands of Hawaii) and East ofLongitude 130 East and West of Longitude 120 West.  It would thus comprise(a) Dependent Territories within the RegionFiji-Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.British Solomon Islands Protectorate.British Line Islands.Tonga (Protected State).Pitcairn Group.Cook Islands.Tokelau or Union Group.Western Samoa (Mandated).Kermadecs.Australian New Guinea (Mandated).Papua.Australian Solomons.Norfolk Islands.Nauru (Mandated).New Hebrides.Canton and Enderbury Islands.New Caledonia and Loyalty Islands.Wallis and Futuna Islands.French Oceania.Dutch New Guinea.Aru Islands.Kei Islands.Eastern Samoa.Johnston Island.Kugwa Reef.Palmyra.Howland and Baker Islands.Wake Island.Guam.Marshall Group.Caroline Group.marinas.Palau Island.and their Parent States United Kingdom.New Zealand.Australia.British Commonwealth.Anglo-French Condominium.Anglo-American Condominium.France.Netherlands.United States.Present Japanese Mandates.The Governments of Australia and New Zealand, both at the CanberraConference of January-February 1944 and again at the Wellington Conferenceof November 1944, have recommended the establishment of a South Seas RegionalCommission with advisory powers. Under the plan proposed by the twoDominion Governments there would be a Commission proper consisting ofrepresentatives of the Governments and Dominions in the Region; a secretariat,and research and functional bodies established by the Member Governments onthe advice of the Commission. It is contemplated that provision should be madefor associating with the work of the Commission existing research and functionalbodies; and also that arrangements should be made for association of the nativepeoples in the work of the Commission. There might also be a standing-conference meeting from time to time under the aegis of the Commission. HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom agree that the South Pacific isan area in which the establishment of a Regional Commission would be useful-
(3)   South-East Asia.(a) Dependent Territories within the Region and their Parent States ;Straits Settlements and Malay States.       United Kingdom. .North Borneo.Sarawak.Hong Kong.Netherlands India. Netherlands.Timor. - Portugal.Indo-China. France.Philippines. United States.(b) Independent State within the Region.Siam. -(c) Independent States outside the Region but with interests in it -Australia.China.India.It will be for the Governments of Burma and Ceylon to decide&quot; for themselveswhether they wish to be associated with the work of this Regional Commission.South-East Asia seems to be an area suitable eventually for the establishmentof a Regional Commission, though clearly it is impracticable to make any progress with the formulation of a regional organisation while the area is still in enemy occupation.(4) West Africa.(a) Dependent Territories within the Region and their Parent States -Nigeria, including Cameroons United Kingdom.under British Mandate.Gold Coast, including Togolandunder British Mandate.Sierra Leone.Gambia.French West Africa, including France.Togoland under French Mandate.Cameroons under French Mandate.Portuguese Guinea. Portugal.Spanish Guinea (including Fernando Po).   Spain.(b) Independent State within the Region.Liberia.(c) Independent States outside the Region but with interests in it.The States to be included in this category will require examination in thelight of the general post-war settlement: for example, the United States ofAmerica might appropriately be included on the grounds of strategic interest.(5) Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.(a) Dependent territories within the Region and their Parent States.Kenya. United Kingdom.Uganda.Tanganyika (Mandated).Zanzibar.Northern Rhodesia.Nyasaland.Bechuanaland Protectorate.Basutoland.Swaziland., Belgian Congo, and Mandated territory   Belgium,of Ruanda-Urundi.
The Governments of Mauritius and Seychelles might be associated with thework of this Commission when matters of interest to them are under discussion.(6) North-East A frica.(a) Dependent territories within the Region and their Parent States.British Somaliland.French Somaliland.Italian Somaliland.Eritrea.United Kingdom.France.The Power or Powers entrusted with their future adminis-tration.United Kingdom and Egypt(Condominium).Sudan.(b) Independent State within the Region.Ethiopia.In view of the close economic and other ties between Aden and the SomaliCoast, provision should be made for the Government of Aden to be associated withthe work of the Commission when necessary.(B) Functional Agencies of the World Organisation.14. Apart from the purely constitutional problem of the relationship between a dependent territory and its Parent State (which, it has been suggestedin paragraph 12 above, is not suitable for international handling) the problemsof Colonial administration which have a legitimate international interest arecommon social and economic problems of public administration which arise insome form in all territories, irrespective of their international status. Manyof them transcend all political boundaries and some cannot even be confinedwithin any particular geographical region. To ensure proper international co--operation in the solution of such problems, functional agencies attached to theWorld Organisation are desirable. This principle is reeognised in Chapter IXof the Dumbarton Oaks Agreement. Some agencies of this kind, such as theI.L.O., have been in existence for some years and have already proved their value.15. What agencies would be useful, their precise relationship to theproposed World Organisation as well as to Regional Commissions and theirmethod of operation are matters for international discussion. Some preliminaryideas are developed below (paragraphs 16 to 19 inclusive). Certain features,however, will be essential to all such agencies if they are to be fully effective and at the same time acceptable by the United Nations as being compatible withthe doctrine of national sovereignty, which presupposes that responsibility and power cannot be divorced. These features, noted below, are suggested by experience of the working of the International Labour Organisation, the generalstructure and functions of which are set out in Part XIII of the Treaty ofVersailles.(a) The Charter of all such agencies must cover all territories irrespective of their international status.French Equatorial Africa. France.Madagascar.Reunion.Portuguese East and West Africa. Portugal.South-West Africa (Mandated). Union of South Africa.(b) Independent States within the Region The Union of South Africa.The self-governing Colony of Southern Rhodesia.
(b) Every State member of the World Organisation must agree in advance to publish periodical reports in respect both of its metropolitan area and of any dependent territories for which it is responsible : andto forward copies to the, agency concerned : these reports to coverpoints laid down as being essential to the proper discharge of thatagency&apos;s functions,   (cf. Article 408, Treaty of Versailles.)(c) Each agency must be well staffed with technical or professional experts in the subject with which it is concerned.(d) The results of the agencies&apos; deliberations would take the form of recommendations to the member States. It should be an obligationupon States which accept such recommendations to bring them tothe notice of the competent authority in each dependent territory forwhich they are responsible, and to impress upon those authorities the importance of applying the recommendations unless, even withmodification to suit local circumstances, they are definitelyinapplicable,   (cf. Article 421, Treaty of Versailles.)(e) Wherever possible, any recommendations for more progressive inter-national policies and improved standards should be accompanied bysome provision ensuring that any resulting privileges or advantagesare withheld from those States which are not willing to accept theobligations.16. Suggested agencies. Apart from the Economic Commission proposedin Chapter IX (D) (1) of the Dumbarton Oaks Agreement/the following is a listof social subjects for which functional agencies might, in the dpinion of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, be usefully established wherethey do not already exist : (i) Labour,(ii) Health,(iii) Food, Agriculture and Animal Health,(iv) Dangerous Drugs,(v) Penal Administration and Prison Reform.17. Relation to World Organisation. -The Dumbarton Oaks Agreementcontemplates the creation of various organs, of which the following are relevant to the present memorandum : (i) The General Assembly, which is to initiate studies and make recommen-dations for the purpose of promoting international co-operation in political, economic and social fields; to make recommendations for theco-ordination of the policies of international economic, social andother specialist agencies brought into relation with the organisation in accordance with agreements between such agencies and the organisations, and to receive and consider annual and special reports from the various bodies of the organisation. (Chapter V (6). (7)and (8).)(ii) Under the General Assembly there is to be set up an Economic and social Council with functions as in Chapter IX (C) (1). this commission in turn is to set up -(iii) An Economic Commission, a Social Commission and such other Commis-sions as may be required.  (Chapter IX (D) (1).)The terms &apos; on which each of the specialist Economic, Social and other organisations or agencies should be brought into relationship with the mainorganisation are to be determined by agreement between the Economic and social council and the appropriate authorities of the specialist organisation or agencysubject to approval by the General Assembly.  (Chapter IX (A) (2).)18. In the last resort, the decision whether to adopt and put into effect any recommendations resulting from this chain of organisations must rest with theGovernments of the member States. The objective is action, not merelydiscussion, and it is important, therefore, to avoid over-elaboration of themachinery. The exact status of the agencies carried forward from before thewar particularly the I.L.O. will raise special problems which are outside thescope of this memorandum.19.   Method of operation. The method of operation of each agency can best be worked out in the light of experience; but, broadly speaking,, in addition tothe interchange of information, there are two ways in wnich these agencies could[28783] &apos; c 2
operate: They could make specific recommendations to individual States as to particular matters which have come to their notice in territories for which thoseStates are responsible; and they could evolve new general codes of policy orstandards of administration for multi-national adoption. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom feel that the real value of the proposed agencies isin bringing international thought to bear on general problems and thusprogressively improving standards throughout the world. The preamble to part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles, dealing with the organisation of labour,points out that the failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve conditions intheir own countries. This is equally true of social conditions other than labour.Hence the importance of dealing with these problems not only in relation todependent areas but in relation to sovereign States as well. This point cannotbe too often emphasised. The progressive improvement of standards can best beachieved by the preparation of draft codes, conventions or reciprocal agreements on the lines of the various International Labour Conventions, the InternationalSanitary Conventions, Dangerous Drugs Conventions, &amp;c. The emphasis shouldthroughout be placed on constructive achievement on the widest possible inter-national basis.III. Measures to ensure Publicity in Colonial Administration.20. Part II of this memorandum has described the measures recommendedby His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for international colLabo-ration in problems of colonial administration of common interest. Somethingfurther, however, is necessary. Whether in independent States or in dependent territories good government requires not only that the administrative machineshould work effectively, but also that the public should be able to satisfy itself thatthe policy and practice of the Government accord with modern standards. Inan independent State this requirement is met in various w^ays according to thecustom of the country concerned: but the effectiveness of all of them dependsentirely upon the necessary information being readily available to the public sothat the actions of the Government may be open to public scrutiny and freecriticism. The same general principles apply in regard to dependent territories,though the position is inevitably somewhat different, partly because in many such territories the bulk of the population is not sufficiently advanced, politically oreducationally, to be able to act as an effective vehicle of criticism, (though thishandicap is by no means confined to dependent territories); and partly because in the last resort the power of decision rests, not with the people of the territoryitself, but with the Government of the Parent State. This circumstance,associated with the idea of &quot;trusteeship,&quot; has led many students of colonial affairs in Great Britain and elsewdiere to advocate a system&apos; of international supervision of colonial administration. This doctrine has found expression inmany forms, though the extreme conception of an international body with powersoverriding those of the Government of the Parent State does not now find favourin many quarters. Nevertheless, this theory of accountability to some outsideauthority has been supported by many experts, and clearly deserves carefulanalysis.21. As has been indicated in paragraph 2 of this memorandum, the term&quot; trusteeship &quot; in relation to the British Colonial Empire has been used as a convenient description of the attitude of mind of successive Governments towards their colonial responsibilities rather than as a definition of the status -of the parent State; and it did not carry with it any implication that the Parliamentof the United Kingdom was accountable for its actions to any third party. Indeedsuch a conception would be impracticable on constitutional grounds not only inGreat Britain but in any sovereign country. It is impossible to divorce power fromresponsibility, nor could the Government of any Parent State bind itself inadvance by any international obligation to act in all circumstances upon recom-mendations from an international body on matters within the State&apos;s colonialresponsibilities. It must leave itself free to judge every case on its merits with afull knowledge of pertinent facts and criticisms.22. The position is that there arises in dependent territories as elsewherecertain joint problems which have an inherent international significance (forexample, economic policy or public health control); and certain parallel problems,in tackling which the interchange of ideas and experience between nations can
prove of the utmost benefit to individual Governments, even though the practiceadopted in one country may not directly affect the interests of any other. in both these categories of problem, the case for international collaboration restsupon the nature of the subject and not upon the status of the territories in whichthe problems arise. For dealing with them, the most effective machinery is thatdescribed in Part II of this memorandum. It does not follow that every aspect of colonial administration, irrespective of its functional nature, is a matter ofinternational concern merely on account of the dependent status of the territory.Indeed, with the progressive political advancement of the colonial peoples theidea of international supervision of dependent territories as such becomes moreand more unrealistic and inappropriate. In proportion as the inhabitants areentrusted with a greater share in the control of their own affairs they will become increasingly resentful of interference from outside in matters of domestic concern, and especially from a body which can have no direct interest in, orresponsibility for, them. It is probable that they would much prefer to have todeal only with a single Parent State which understands their requirements and aspirations and which- has the power to take decisions. This view is, in fact,borne out by articles in the local press in several British Territories.23. Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are convinced that full publicity is one of the best vehicles for stimulating progressivepolicies, and consider that it should be perfectly possible to devise a means of ensuring world-wide publicity on colonial affairs, and of providing an oppor-tunity of healthy constructive criticism, without contravening the constitutionalprinciples, or giving rise to the local political resentment, referred to above.24. Some guidance can perhaps be obtained from the past experience and practice of Great Britain in this respect. It has long been the normal practiceof British Colonial administration to publish annually (i) a short general report on the social and economic progress of each of herdependent territories not only those under Mandate; and(ii) full detailed reports on the various departments of each colonial adminis-tration (health, education, &amp;c).(Although these reports have been discontinued during the war, they will be resumed as soon, as circumstances permit.) All the annual general reports, andthe more important of the departmental reports, are prepared in conformity withmodel forms drawn up in the Colonial Office. His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom suggest that all the Colonial Powers should be invited to agreeto publish annually reports on the administration of their dependent territoriesthrough whatever governmental procedure is normal in the country concerned.The general form of these reports should be standardised by international agree-ment. The way in which this might be done is developed in paragraphs 25 and26 below. The primary justification for such reports is to satisfy one of the basicrequirements of democratic government by providing the inhabitants of theterritory itself, and of the responsible Parent State, with the material necessaryfor developing a healthy public opinion focussed upon the actions of the govern-ing authorities. The reports would, however, also serve the wider, but subsidiary,purpose of enabling public opinion throughout the world to be fully informed asto the political, social and economic advancement of colonial peoples, especially if there were established some international centre at which copies of allpublished reports and other publications dealing with colonial affairs would be on record.25. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom accordingly recom-mend the creation of an International Colonial Centre, the primary function ofwhich would be to determine and periodically revise the scope of the annualgeneral reports. Where there is a specialist international agency, that body will obviously be the-best suited to determine the scope of the relevant report, but theInternational Colonial Centre and the various functional agencies should workjn close association in order to avoid duplication and overlapping of reports.The Centre would be entitled to receive copies of all official reports published on colonial affairs. (The functional agencies of the World Organisation wouldalso, of course, receive copies of reports on subjects within their purview.) TheCentre should also be provided with sufficient funds to enable it to buy copies ofnon-official publications on colonial affairs. For the reasons given in para-graphs 21 and 22 above, it should not have any supervisory or executive powers,though it would no doubt wish from time to time to summarise and collate the
material at its disposal and would require a.permanent expert staff. It would,incidentally, thus provide a means of ensuring that the benefits of internationalthought and experience are available to the Government of any territory whichdoes not naturally fit into a Regional organisation, and upon any subjects not covered by a functional agency. The Centre would, in short, be an internationalcentre.of information and research on colonial affairs, and the document whichestablishes its constitution might usefully recite the main objective of colonial policy, with its three implications of (a) development of self-government, (6) social and economic advancement, and (c) the recognition of the responsibilities due from members of the world community one to another, as an accepted guide to world opinion.26. The Centre might be under the aegis of a Sub-Committee of the Economicand Social Council of the projjosed World Organisation. This Sub-Committeewould be composed of representatives of all the Colonial Powers plus a numberof others whom the General Assembly might be invited to choose from othercountries whose experience or interests enable them to make a special contribution in any particular field of colonial development. The Centre would form an integral part of the World Organisation, and it would thus be open to the general assembly to discuss international aspects of questions arising out of theCentre&apos;s work.IV. Mandated Territories and Italian Colonies.27. During the last 25 years an increasing interest in the well-being of colonial peoples within the world community has resulted in much discussion of possible forms of international organisation to secure this end. After the war of1914-19 this approach led to the creation of the Mandate System to providefor the administration of part of the Ottoman Empire and also of the ex-german colonies. As a result of the present war similar problems will arise regardingthe arrangements to be made for the administration of the former Italian colonies and those ex-German Colonies the Mandate for which was entrusted to Japan.Moreover, it will also in any case be necessary to consider the future of theMandatory Principle as a whole in relation to the post-war settlement. before considering these problems, it will be useful to examine, in the light of some25 years&apos; experience, how far the Mandate System successfully achieved its object.28. The Mandate System was applied to certain parts of the ottoman empire mainly inhabited by Arabs and also to the German Colonies. It wasappreciated that the former had already reached &quot; a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subjectto the rendering of admirfistrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.&quot; These territories, known as territories under &quot; A &quot; Mandates, were in a class by themselves. The special problems ofthe two remaining, namely, Palestine with Trans Jordan (under British Mandate)and Syria with Lebanon (under French Mandate) will require separate considera-tion and these territories are not therefore included within the scope of theproposals now made. The German Colonies, however, were inhabited by peoplesfar less advanced both politically and economically; and it was realised thatthere could be no prospect of their being able to stand alone as independent nations for many years to come. Special arrangements had therefore to be made forthese territories; and, in entrusting their administration to certain of the allied and Associated Powers, an attempt was made to safeguard the basic principlesof sound colonial policy by an internationally accepted system. These principlesfound expression in the &quot;B &quot; and &apos;&apos; C &quot;* Mandates and in Article 22 of theCovenant of the League of Nations, the material passage in which reads : &quot; To those Colonies and territories which as a consequence cf the late war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerlygoverned them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by theni-selves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be appliedthe principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacredtrust of civilisation.....&quot;29. Practical weaknesses have been found to exist in the Mandate System.In the first place, it was designed at least as much to protect the interests ofother Powers as to ensure the development of the territory in the interests ofthe inhabitants themselves.   Some of the specific obligations were, therefore,
rather negative in character, and the positive obligations to promote the material and moral welfare of the inhabitants were inevitably expressed in very general terms. Moreover, the limitations inherent, in a document which attempted to prescribe a single permanent policy for a number of different territories in thelight of then existing circumstances and ideas, made it difficult to effect the adjustments required to meet the new problems of Colonial administration arising in an ever-changing world : while, on the other hand, the uncertainty as to thefuture of these mandated territories did not encourage a long-term develop-mental policy on the part of the Mandatory. Apart from these generalweaknesses in the system, many of the obligations imposed (e.g., those dealingwith Forced Labour, and Slavery) were, or became, the subject of multilateralconventions which were applicable to other territories as well as to those undermandate. General problems of this nature can in any case be much better dealtwith in relation to all territories where they arise, and not under a systemconfined to mandated territories. Specialised international arrangements ofthis kind (whether through the medium of functional agencies or multilateralconventions) can more readily be adapted to changes in world conditions orchanging conceptions of policy, than provisions in documents such- as the mandates. Such provisions are inevitably drawn up in the light of views of world policy prevailing at the time, and if world conditions or policy change,are apt to remain as somewhat one-sided relics of past policy out of relationto conditions in similar countries not subject to Mandate. The provisions ofthe Mandates on defence matters provide one example. These aimed, in effect,at the permanent neutralisation of the territories and could be interpreted asprecluding the Mandatory from effectively providing for their security in modern conditions of global warfare. The requirements of non-discrimination in economic matters, commonly described as the &quot;open door&quot; policy, affordanother instance. Economic arrangements in these territories should conform to whatever economic arrangements on a world-wide basis may be- arrived at as part of the post-war setlement; and the freedom of&apos;these territories to adjust their economic policy should not be subject to special restrictions from which other territories are exempt.30. Although the spirit in which the Mandate system was conceived repre-sented a genuine advance and its indirect influences were for the most part good,the Permanent Mandates Commission was not designed to encourage theMandatory Powers to collaborate in adjusting their policies to meet the needs ofthe people in the territories, which will be the main purpose of the systemnow proposed. Experience of the administration of Mandated territories hasconvinced His Majesty&apos;s Government that the objectives which the mandate system sought to achieve can better be realised for the future under a compre-hensive system, on the basis outlined in Part II and III of this paper, which wouldbe applicable to all dependent territories and would not involve the creation of aspecial international status for some of them. His Majesty&apos;s government consider, therefore, that in respect of any dependency now administered underB or C Mandate by one of the United Nations, the Parent State should in thefuture be free to exercise its jurisdiction without the prescriptions of themandatory regime but in conformity with the wider and more flexible systemdescribed in Parts II and III of this Memorandum.31. In determining the future administration of the ex-German islandsMandated to Japan, and also the Italian Colonial Empire, the same general considerations apply, namely that it is undesirable to create a special international status for them. The islands under Japanese Mandate will clearly have to betransferred to some authority other than Japan and the same is doubtless true of much, if not all, of the Italian Colonial Empire. Provided that any changesin the Powers responsible for these areas are made contingent upon the acceptance by the new Power of the general system of international obligations for dependent territories described in this Memorandum, such changes, it is considered, couldnot be regarded as conflicting with the spirit of the Atlantic Charter.Part V. Conclusion.32. The conclusions which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Unitedkingdom have reached may be summed up as follows : (i) International collaboration is essential to achieve the objective of promoting to the utmost the well-being of Colonial peoples within theworld community, with its three implications of (a) development of
self-government, (b) social and economic advancement and (c) the recognition of the responsibilities due from members of the world community one to another,(ii) The majority of the problems to be tackled are not however confined to dependent territories, and do not arise out of their dependentstatus. Such general problems must be viewed in their relationship to the &quot;similar problems of sovereign States as well as those of otherdependent territories.(iii) For this purpose some system is necessary which is at the same timewider in territorial scope than the Mandate System and more flexible and adaptable in organisation : one which will afford adequate recogni-tion of the progressive advancement of the inhabitants of dependent territories, and their changing political relationship with their ParentStates.(iv) His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom consider that thesystem of international collaboration best calculated to achieve the desired results is that described in Part II of this Memorandum,(v) Apart from measures of active international collaboration, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment also attach the utmost importance to full publicity in colonial administration, thus ensuring opportunities of free and well-informed public comment and criticism. They desire to seeinternational agreement and uniformity of policy on this question.This, they consider, can best be achieved on the lines suggested inPart III of this. Memorandum,(vi) His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that all Governments concerned willbe willing to co-operate in a general system of the kind proposed inthis Memorandum. It is, indeed, an essential feature of the proposals that they should be universally adopted and acted upon by all con-cerned in a spirit of friendly collaboration, with frank interchange of experience and ideas, towards the common goal.Colonial Office, S.W.1,14th December, 1944.
