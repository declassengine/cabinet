Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 731.14^A December,r, 1944.WAR CABINET.\ELEVENTH REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON national expenditure.1. At their meeting on the 13th December (L.P. (44) 56th meeting) theLord Presidents Committee considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer* dealing with four recommendations made in the Eleventh Reportof the Select Committee on National Expenditure, which is a general reportgiving the Select Committee&apos;s views on the examination of national expenditure.2.   The recommendations are as follows : 1(a) that  there should be an enquiry  by a  Select Committee speciallyappointed for the purpose into the means of securing the most effective control by Parliament of public expend iture;(6) that the Select Committee on National Expenditure appointed for thepresent Session should not be limited in their enquiries to &quot; servicesdirectly connected with the war &apos;&apos;;(c) that the Select Committee on National Expenditure in any particularSession should not be limited to the consideration of current expenditure incurred in a single financial year but should be able toexamine the expenditure on any given project as a whole;(d) that the Select Committee on National Expenditure should present to theHouse of Commons a general and objective review of the distributionof national expenditure oh war services during the past five years.3. The Lord Presidents Committee agreed that the proposal for a generalenquiry by a Select Committee into the exercise by the House of Commons of .control over expenditure required further consideration. They were also satisfiedthat any general review of the distribution of national expenditure on war servicesover the past five years which might be undertaken, should be carried out by theGovernment and not by the Select Committee on National Expenditure.4. The Lord Presidents Committee were also opposed to the proposal that -the limitation ,in the terms of reference of the Select Committee on National &apos;Expenditure to &apos;&apos; services directly connected with the war &apos;&apos; should be removed.There is some justification for the work of the Select Committee in relation towar services financed from the Vote of Credit, but to extend the Committee&apos;terms of reference so as to enable them to enquire into all services, whetherfinanced from the Vote of Credit or not, is not only unnecessary, in view of thearrangements for Supply days, but would undermine the responsibility ofMinisters and would lead to an impossible situation when there is a returnto party Government with an effective Opposition.5. With regard to the proposal that it should be made clear that theSelect Committee are not strictly limited to enquiring into current expenditure,the Lord Presidents Committee agreed that the point, which is not one of muchsubstance, might be met by amending the terms of reference to enable the Com-mittee to consider &quot; matters that are the subject of current expenditure defrayedout of monies provided by Parliament.&quot; It would be made clear to the SelectCommittee that they should not roam over the sphere of the Public accounts committee.6.   The Lord Presidents Committee invited me&quot;to bring their conclusions on these matters to the attention of the War Cabinet.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.C. R.
