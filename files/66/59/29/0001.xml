THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.The clreMlailOBi of fills paper has &quot;mem strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of top&quot; secret.P. (44) 729.12th December, 1944.YtfAR CABINET.THE NAVAL CONTRIBUTION TO ARMY MAN-POWER NEEDS.Memorandum by the First Lord of the. Admiralty.1. The Secretary of State for War has set out in his memorandum .P. (44) 705 certain requirements which involve the transfer from the other two Services of (a) 10,000 basically trained Grade I men in the course of the nextfew months, and (b) the possible transfer of 60,000 more basically trained menstarting on the 1st January, 1945.2. I wish to make it clear that the Admiralty are most desirous of making their contribution towards maintaining the strength of the Army during the final stages of the war with Germany. They are prepared to make the following unitsavailable on loan to the Army : (a) 5th R.M. A.A. Brigade, now at Antwerp and due to bereturned to the Admiralty on the 31st December, 1944,to remain lent to the Army       ...       ...      ...       ...        2,868(b) One   R.M.   Infantry   Brigade   of   battle-experiencedpersonnel to be formed now, trained and mobilised,including 20 per cent, first-line reinforcements, plusan overall wastage figure of 50 per cent. This will allow 8 per cent, per month replacements over 6 months&apos;operations ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      ....       ...        4,500(c) One R.M. Infantry Brigade as at (&amp;) to follow.  These menmay not be battle experienced ..........        4,500Total...............      ...      11,868The above will be formed units of the Royal Marines, to which men from theRoyal Navy will be added, should this be necessary, to maintain the formations.3. The Admiralty attaches the highest importance to the transfer as formedunits of any personnel loaned to the Army, The R.M. have been through manyvicissitudes; to obtain the best results from these men and to maintain theiresprit de corps their entity should be preserved. Moreover, it is essential thatthese formed units should be available to the Navy in the Far East after theGerman War ends.4. The loan of these personnel to the Army must retard the further deploy -ment of Naval forces to foreign stations, and will have some repercussions on the manning of the later units of the assault forces. Until a careful examination ofall relevant factors has been made, the full effects cannot be stated. Nevertheless,the Admiralty are prepared to go this far in order to assist the efforts to securethe early defeat of Germany.5. The transfers proposed in W.P. (4^). 705 are, however, not related to thatpurpose. They are : (a) to effect a rapid and efficient redeployment of militaryforces against Japan at the end of hostilities in Europe; (b) to enable the army to reduce the tour of service overseas. I am compelled to emphasise that in thepresent acute naval man-power situation, any transfers to the Army to assist inthe solution of these problems would be quite unacceptable. In addition, the WarOffice are asking for a large number of new entries for these same purposes.[28815]
6. As regards (a) I would point out that the transfers to the Army couldonly add to the difficulties already being experienced in sending the Fleet to eastern waters while continuing naval operations against Germany. I havestressed elsewhere the difficult situation which faces us as a result of the shortageof R.M.E.S and labour for preparing bases for the war against Japan, and theshortage of administrative personnel to man those bases. Acceleration of theredeployment of the Army will be of no avail, if it causes a delay in the deployment of corresponding naval forces. Yet this will be the&apos; inevitable consequence ifnaval personnel are to be transferred to assist in the redeployment of the Army.As regards (&amp;). I sympathise with the desire to reduce the length of time the soldier spends overseas, but I must point out that at the end of the German warthe Army will be reducing their strength by something more than a million men.On the figures provisionally accepted by the Chiefs of Staff, after considerationof the Prime Ministers Directive W.P. (44) 571,&quot; the reduction is understood tobe about 48 per cent, of the Army strength at October 1944. The corresponding figure for the R.A.F. is believed to be 42 per cent. The Navy will be releasingabout 24 per cent. The disparity between these figures is obvious for all to see :it is as dangerous as it is startling. It has already been agreed in principle between the Service Departments that the rate of release should not be undulydisproportionate as between the three Services : measures such as adjustment in recruiting entries after the defeat of Germany are contemplated and eventransfers of specialist and technical personnel to the Navy from the other services may be necessary, for this purpose. If the proposals in W.P. (44) 705 regardingtransfers to the Army in the near future were applied to the Navy, the result would inevitably be greatly to worsen this disparity against the Navy and thus to aggravate the problems of dealing with the release of men from the Fleet.7. In this same connection, I would also point out that the sailor&apos;s positionin this question of overseas service is by no means as favoured as is sometimessupposed.. While he may come home at the end of 2^ or 3 years&apos; foreign service,in a high percentage of cases further foreign service will inevitably soon follow.About two-thirds of the Navy will be serving abroad after the defeat of Germany.It is understood that the soldier who is repatriated, on the other hand, remains at home or at least in Europe. In all these circumstances I feel it is evident thatthe Navy is not in a position to help with the solution of these problems.8. So far this Memorandum has been concerned solely with the effects of direct transfers from one Service to another. There are, however, two points in w.P. (44) 705 connected with the entry from civil life which I wish to comment on :  (i) The entry of 25,000 men to facilitate redeployment after the defeat ofGermany (para. 13, p. 4) and the entry of another 25,000 specialist-tradesmen to replace Class B releases (para. 15, p. 5).In my Memorandum WT. (44) 724 I make no demand for men for the Navy for either of these purposes. An entry of 15,000additional to the present demand will be wanted if the policyadvocated by the War Office, which should then also apply to the Navy,is adopted.(ii) The demand for an entry of 18,000 men as temporary substitutes duringleave of men not eligible for release or &quot; Python&quot; (para, 16, p. 5).I must confess that this commitment occasioned me some surprise,since in W.P. (44) 644 it was clearly stated that men absent on leavefrom operational theatres would not be replaced. It was stated that&quot;their temporary absence from the theatre of Avar can be accepted,since their return after a few weeks can be counted upon.&quot;9. To sum up, the Secretary of State for War asks for transfers and newentries to assist in the redeployment against Japan, to facilitate Class B releases,to provide leave and shorten the tour of overseas service. None of these proposals will contribute toAvards shortening the European War. The Navy is faced with similar problems, and, whilst the Admiralty are most anxious to assist the army to bring the maximum pressure against Germany now, and have indicated their willingness to do so in paras. 2, 3 and 4 above, they cannot agree to transfers fronrthe Navy for these other purposes, which would merely relieve the Army problem by aggravating that of the Navy.A.
