The most striking advances during the past week have again been those&quot;in the south. Strasbourg was liberated on the 23rd, and since then French andU.S. forces have made rapid progress in clearing the large enemy pocket betweenStrasbourg and Mulhouse. In the centre, the Third U.S. Army is across theGerman frontier, or within a very few miles of it, on a 45-mile front in the Saararea.The combined First and Ninth U.S. Armies&apos; attack has succeeded in reaching the Roer at several points after a week of hard fighting.British troops have completed the clearing of the Meuse pocket, except for asmall enemy bridgehead west of Venlo.Southern Group of A armies.25. Between Mulhouse and Belfort, the First French Army has had to fighthard to consolidate its gains of the previous week. North of Basle, the enemystill holds the west bank of the Rhine, and has resisted strongly any attempts to advance north from Mulhouse. South-west of the town, the French have beenfighting to widen the narrow corridor through which their lines of communicationruns, just north of the Swiss border.On the 27th French forces reached the south bank of the Rhine-Rhone Canal,which runs S.W. between Mulhouse and Montbeliard. On the same day, french forces advancing from Mulhouse and Belfort respectively secured the lineof the Mulhouse-Belfort road, thus cutting off an enemy pocket north of the Rhine-Rhone canal. In Belfort, the last of the enemy-heldforts was captured on the 26th.   The whole of the French left flank is now
pressing forward slowly from Belfort, from Giromagny, 8 miles further north,and along the St. Maurice-Mulhouse road. Further north, the left of the SeventhU.S. Army continued its advance through the Saverne Gap. The capture of Strasbourg was claimed on the 23rd, and two days later it was clear that wehad a firm hold upon the city and a secure line of communication through Saverne.The enemy still holds both ends of the Rhine bridges east of Strasbourg.On the 26th, a U.S. force advancing through the Vosges from St. Die madecontact with the force at Strasbourg by way of St. Blaise and Molsheim. Theright of the Seventh U.S. Army is now pressing slowly through the Vosgestowards Colmar, the left is moving south from Strasbourg and, in the north, is some 15-20 miles from the German frontier on a wide front.Central Group of A armies.26. The Third U.S. Army has advanced steadily along its whole front. Onthe right, Fenetrang was liberated on the 23rd, and U.S. troops are now on the outskirts of Saarunion. In the centre, after the capture of St. Avoid on the,26th,U.S. troops advanced to within 3-4 miles of the frontier on a 20-mile front.Organised resistance in Metz itself ceased on the 22nd, and the last of the enemy-held forts east of the city had been cleared 5 days later. On the left, U.S.armoured and infantry units are now astride the German frontier on a 25-milefront, and here enemy resistance is much more stubborn than is the case further south.The First and Ninth U.S. Armies&apos; drive to the Roer has again been the scene of the most bitter fighting. U.S. troops have pressed steadily forward on a10-mile front, and have now reached the Roer at several points north and southof Julich.   Opposite Duren, they have still to clear part of the Hurtgen forest.Northern Group of A armies.27. In the Meuse pocket British Second Army now holds the whole of thewest bank of the river, except for a small but determined pocket of enemy resist-ance at Blerick, a western suburb of Venlo. The enemy blew the bridge over theM^euse at Venlo on the 25th November.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)28. After three days&apos; hard fighting along the River Oosina, the enemy were forced to carry out a withdrawal on the 24th thus enabling Eighth Armytroops to push rapidly forward. By the evening of the 24th our foremost troops had cleared the River Montone, north of Highway 9 and had covered half the distance to the River Lamone; astride the Highway the outskirts of Faenzahad been entered and further south a bridgehead had been established over theRiver Marzeno, a tributary of the River Lamone. On the following day ournewly won positions were consolidated, and north of Highway 9 further progress towards the River Lamone was made. The bridgehead over the River Marzenowas also enlarged.On the 26th the enemy carried out a further withdrawal to behind theRiver Lamone S.W. of Faenza, and British and Polish troops followed up,the latter establishing an outpost over the river in the area of Brisighella.South of Russi the enemy temporarily stabilised his positions and Indian troops were last reported to be involved in fairly heavy fighting.On the 27th the weather again broke and has virtually stopped all active operations., The general policy of rest and refit has continued in the Fifth Army; indian troops on the right flank, who are in touch with the Poles, have taken advantageof the enemy withdrawal further to the right, and have made some progress.The enemy has slightly increased his artillery activity during this period,especially in the Monte Grande area. Around Gaggio Brazilian troops(supported by troops from a U.S. armoured unit) improved their positions onthe 25th. Elsewhere there has been little or no change in our forward positionsalong this Army front.The Eastern European Campaign. (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.29. The Germans continued their withdrawal from Northern Finland, and only a small area in the extreme N.W. of the country is still in German hands.
Northern Sector.30.   The &quot;Russians have now completely cleared the island of Oesel.The Germans claim to have defeated further strong Russian attacks S.E.of Libau. They may, however, have been exaggerating the scale of the fighting,to which the Russians have made no reference.Southern Sector.31. The Russians have gained some ground in Czechoslovakia and havealso taken the railway junction of Hatvan, N.E. of Budapest.They have been attacking west and of Sombor, v/here they had previously gained a foothold on the western bank of the Danube. As a resultof these attacks they have broken through the German defences on a wide front and have advanced 25 miles to capture Pecs.Practically the whole of Albania and S.E. of Yugoslavia have now been evacuated by the Germans, whose retreat is being hampered by partisanactivities on their routes of withdrawal. The partisans have occupied Raska(65 miles west of Nis) and now control the north-south road through that townexcept for Kraljevo and Novi Pazar which still remains in German hands.Burma.32. East African troops are closing in on Kalewa. Their leading elementsare at present only seven miles from the village to the north and five to the west.In the Mytttha River Valley Indian troops have reported the valley clear ofthe enemy as far south as Gangaw. In the Sittaung area other Indian troops have enlarged their bridgehead east of Chindwin to a depth of some 20 miles.They captured a village 17 miles south of Paungbyin on the 26th.In Northern Burma British troops are encountering stiff opposition on the outskirts of Pinwe, 9 miles N.E. of Indaw. Chinese troops continue their operations * for the reduction of Bhamo. Patrols from the Sikaw area havereached a point 24 miles S.W. of Namhkam, without contacting the enemy.China.33. The Japanese, in their advance to the Kwangsi-Kweichow railway,occupied Hochih on the 22nd, and pressed forward towards Namtam. On their right flank another column captured Ssuen, on the 23rd, and the Japanese claimit has reached the border of Kweichow.S.W. of Liuchow Japanese forces, driving towards the French Indo-Chinaborder, captured Nanning on the 22nd.Philippines.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)34. In Northern Leyte the town of Limon fell to U.S. troops on the 22nd.Torrential rains have swept the Philippines and brought operations virtually toa standstill.

As a result of the bomber command attack on the 22nd November, very severe new damage has been inflictedto the east and west branches of the Dortmund Ems Canal. A&apos;190-feet sectionof the west embankment of the West Canal 200 yards south of the aqueduct hasbeen destroyed and water has drained through the gap, leaving 600 yards ofthe West Canal dry. The aqueduct over the West Canal has been puncturedby at least four hits leaving a hole 60 x 90 feet. Another smaller hole is seen and this damage has contributed to the drainage of water from the West Canal.The embankments of the aqueduct have been damaged by several hits. The holein the aqueduct over the East Canal resulting from the attack by aircraft ofR.A.F. Bomber Command on.the 4th/5th November, 1944, has been enlarged byat least one hit and more water has escaped flooding the River Glane and the surrounding countryside. A 500-yard section of the East Canal south of theaqueduct has been drained. A safety lock on the East Canal 180 feet north ofthe aqueduct has been cut by at least one hit. One barge has been damaged and another destroyed, and the embankments of the East and West Canals have suffered serious damage by many direct hits.Mitteland Canal Embankment (Gravenhorst). As a result of the bomber command attack on the 20th/2lst November a heavy concentration of craters is seen extending east to west across the target. The west embankment has beenbreached in one place allowing the water in the canal to run into the River AA.The water level in the canal has been lowered considerably, stranding numerousbarges, of which seven have been damaged. Many direct hits have been scoredon the east and west embankments and in the bed of the canal. The approaches to two bridges over the canal have been cut in several places.
