THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944SECRET.5/Copy No. 3CW.P. (44) 702.30th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.TEMPORARY CIVIL SERVANTS   AND parliamentary candidature.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.1. The chief danger to government from the political views of temporaryCivil Servants seems to me to lie, not in these officers&apos; &quot; contacts with outside interests,&quot; but in the possible effect on their advice to Ministers. A temporaryCivil Servants adoption as a Parliamentary Candidate will not change his political opinions he is adopted because he holds them. It is right, however,to consider the effect on the public of his actual adoption.2. In my view the present situation is exceptional. A large part of theCivil Service to-day is composed of temporary Civil Servants, who are entitledto regard their work as their wartime service. It seems to me unfair that these people should be disqualified from the exercise of their normal civil rights inoffering themselves as candidates for Parliament, and I do not believe that thepublic would object to them doing so. (In practice, of course, only a small numberwill be involved.) There has been, as far as I am aware, no objection to thecontinued employment in the Civil &quot;Service of the candidates to whom theChancellor refers in paragraph 5 of his Memorandum (W.P. (44) 685).3. I can see that a situation might arise in which it would be advisable totransfer a temporary Civil Servant, on his adoption as a ParliamentaryCandidate, to other work within the Civil Service. Good sense, however, shouldbe capable of dealing with such a situation.4. I do not suggest that temporary Civil Servants should normally beentitled to offer themselves for election to Parliament. In wartime, however,circumstances are different, and I feel that until the end of the war temporaryCivil Servants should be permitted so to offer themselves.G. LI. G.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,30th November, 1944.([ 28732]
