DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,   November 1944. /SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR FOUR. WEEKS ENDING 3rd DECEMBER,  1944.A. A detailed summary of operations is appended.B. Results of Operations.1. Battleship Tirpitz.THE Battleship Tirpitz was sunk on the 12th November in an attack madeby 29 Lancasters, each carrying a 12,000-lb. bomb. Three direct hits were obtained, one of which hit the ship near the bridge and penetrated and split openher port side, while other bombs fell across the ship causing her to capsize very rapidly (see Print No. 1).2. Oil Targets.Attacks were made during the period on the oil plants at Wanne-Eickel,Homberg (Meerbeck), Castrop Rauxel, - Harburg, Sterkrade (Holten), Nordsternand Dortmund. These attacks were all successful and the plants were temporarilyput out of action, with the result that during the last week of the period the listof targets suspended from attack included all ten synthetic plants in the Ruhrand the refineries at Harburg. Print No. 2 shows the heavy destruction caused in thejplant at Bottrop Welheim in the series of attacks made by Bomber CommandPhotographs now show that the attack made through 10/10th cloud by meansof the G.H. navigational aid on the oil plant at Wesseling on the 30th Octobercaused very heavy damage to the main installations, the gas-generating plant, theboiler-house, oil storage and offices.3. German Towns.A number of attacks was made on German towns, but operations generallywere limited owing to bad weather. The town centre of Gelsenkirchen was virtually destroyed in a raid on the 6th November and many important buildings were heavily damaged, including a chemical works, a steel works and a cableworks. On the same night Koblenz was very successfully attacked, the greaterpart of the built-up area, including the main passenger station, being gutted or destroyed. The damage spreads northwards across the River Moselle intoKoblenz-Lutzel, which suffered heavily, and also to a lesser extent across theRiver Rhine into Ehrenbreitstein.At the request of the United States Armies the fortified areas of Duren,Julich and Heinsberg were very heavily attacked on the 16th November. almost the entire built-up area of Duren was destroyed with the exception of a small areadue west of the marshalling yard (see Print No. 3). At Julich, the destructionwas on an even greater scale and, as Print No. 4 shows, the entire built-up area was destroyed.Other towns attacked during the period include Freiburg, Neuss, Essen,munster and Duisburg.WP.

4. Transportation Targets.Two attacks were made on the Dortmund-Ems Canal which had been repairedsince the previous&apos; attack made in September. On the 4th/5th November themain (western) arm of the canal was breached and the eastern by-pass arm was heavily hit where it crosses the River Glane (see Print No. 5). As a result of the attack both arms of the canal were impassable and the water drained into the surrounding countryside. The second attack, carried out on the 21st/22ndNovember, was made at the point where the western arm crosses the River Glane.The aqueduct was wrecked, the western arm was breached and wide areas of the countryside were flooded.   Print No. 6 shows the extreme accuracy of the attack.The Mittelland Canal, which lies to the east of Rheine and carries traffic between central and western-Germany, was attacked on the same night. Thewestern embankment at Gravenhorst was breached over a distance of about50 feet (see Print No. 7) and about 31 miles of the canal is without water.Marshalling yards at Fulda, Cologne (Kalk) and Aschaffenburg were heavily attacked.5. Results of Previous A attacks.The attack made on Bochum on the 4th/5th November caused very heavy damage to both industrial and residential property. Amongst the manyindustrial plants severely damaged are the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. and a factory making milling and grinding machines. In the raid on Knapsack on the28th October heavy damage was done to the Goldenburg Thermal power station,the largest power plant in Germany. Photographs show that the turbine house,boiler and switch houses were all affected and the power stations rendered inactive.Print No. 8 shows the results of the attack made on dusseldorf on the 2nd/3rdNovember, when all the factories in the north and north-east were severely damaged and the northern suburbs virtually destroyed.A H.
