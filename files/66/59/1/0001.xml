THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEfcTVS GOYiEBNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 701.29th November, 1944WAR CABINET,APSLEY HOUSE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. &apos;THE War Cabinet will remember that the Duke of Wellington has offered togive to the nation the site and buildings of Apsley House, the Wellington heir-looms and certain other objects. He asked in return that he and his familyshould be allowed to occupv part of the building free of rent and rates(W.P. (44) 302).2. When the offer came before the War Cabinet on the 12th June, 1944(W.M. (44) 75th Conclusions, Minute 5), the following questions were asked :  (1) Could some limit be put to the period for which the family would retain the right to occupy part of the premises 1(2) Could the pictures be made available for loan to public galleries&apos;?As to (1), the Duke only wishes the right to continue for so long as there is anheir to the title (he has one son aged 28, at present serving with the Forces).As to (2), he would not be willing that the pictures should be loaned to othergalleries.3. I have tried to obtain some estimate of the money value of the gift. Onthe basis of a redevelopment of the site on whi isting building stands,leaving the garden land unbuilt upon, the value of the freehold is estimated at 250,000. The retention of the existing building is, however, desirable in viewof its character and associations. The value of the premises to the Duke is considerably less than the above figure, having regard to the restrictive covenantscontained in the original Crown grant. The contents offered, so far as they canbe valued, are estimated at  250,000. This figure entirely excludes historic or association value and is, even so, on the low side; a dealer would expect to obtain a good deal more in the open market.4. It was suggested that Apsley House, in addition to becoming aWellington Museum, would be very suitable for Government hospitality. TheWar Cabinet agreed that the offer should be considered apart from this question.5. I propose now to accept the offer, subject, of course, to the approval of the trustees.   The Minister of Works is in agreement.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,29th November, 1944.[28727]
