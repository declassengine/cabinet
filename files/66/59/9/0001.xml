Printed for the War Cabinet.   December ij44SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 709.4:th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.ITALY.Memorandum by the Minister Resident at Allied Force Headquarters,Mediterranean.I have had discussions with the Foreign Office, War Office, Treasury and ministry of Production on various points arising out of the new policy towardsItaly.1.2. In the political field we have reached general agreement on the steps that should be taken. They are shown in Annex I attached. Their general purpose is to relax control while retaining all our essential rights.3. So far as the &quot; civilianisation &quot;of the Allied Commission is concerned(referred to in the last paragraph of the President&apos;s telegram of the21st November), there are considerable limiting factors on putting in civilians.The War Office and the Foreign Office both agree with the line I propose to take.II,4. The following principles to govern civilian supplies have been &quot;pro-visionally agreed with the Departments (i) Basic imports should remain a military responsibility as long as militaryoperations are continuing in or are based upon Italy and for a periodof three-six months thereafter. They should be subject to the &quot; disease and unrest&quot; formula but with a more flexible interpretation. The300-gramme ration for all liberated Italy must be included.(ii) A supplementary programme of industrial first aid should be established,financed by the Americans on the scale indicated by the Presidentspublic statements, the United Kingdom share in this programmebeing limited to the sterling equivalent of Italian exports to theUnited Kingdom. Our share will be small compared to that of the americans. This arrangement would cover the question of thedesirable scale of supplies, their financing and the placing of theorders. I would press the Americans to place the orders apart fromany consideration of the present shipping situation, the supplies tobe brought forward as and when shipping space becomes available.I would like authority to come to an understanding with the Americans on(i) and (ii) above, which are in accord with the principles which were approvedby the Ministers concerned in October last, and are set out in Annex II.I would make it plain to them that the needs of Greece and Yugoslaviamust be fully satisfied according to the scale held desirable by the militaryauthorities there as expressed by the Military Commander to SACMED.III.5. Out of the needs for these countries emerges the problem of Europeanneeds generally, both during the period before Germany&apos;s collapse and in the succeeding period during the Far Eastern war. If you wish it, I would attemptto develop the theme that to stick strictly to the &apos;&apos; disease and unrest&apos;&apos; formula [28760]
that is to say, failure to provide sufficient tonnage to import raw materials ormachinery for at least a limited reconstruction of the economic life of Europe would be an error. It would risk all the fruits of victory by the collapse ofEurope into anarchy before any of the long-term reconstruction plans have anopportunity of functioning.. H. M.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,4th December, 1944.ANNEX I.There has been a duality in Allied policy to Italy ever since the signing ofthe Armistice was followed by the doctrine of co-belligerency. Sometimes wehave stood upon one leg-the strict enforcement of Armistice terms upon adefeated enemy; sometimes upon the other friendship and assistance to aco-belligerent whose relations with us are becoming more and more those of anally. We should now take the line that the recent formal change of name fromAllied Control Commission to Allied Commission has a real meaning, and itshould be our purpose only to exercise control where our military needs requireit. Only in this way can we bring a sense of reality and responsibility to theItalian authorities.2. We should inform the Italian Government that while we propose to holdabsolutely to all our rights under the Armistice, particularly our naval, militaryand air force rights, and do not intend to discuss any settlement of purely post-war problems (for instance, territorial and colonial arrangements), yet, subjectto the overriding military needs for the conduct of the campaign, in matters of day-to-day administration we shall hold these rights largely in reserve.3. But there are two stern warnings which we should not hesitate to give.First, in so far as the scale of Allied imports depends upon the efficiency orotherwise of home production, its use and the efficient enforcement of controls,we must make it clear that we shall have regard to the degree of Italian self-help within the physical possibilities of their present situation in fixing thestandard of our help to them and that we are far from satisfied with the stepsthey have taken up to date. Secondly, we must insist on the maintenance of lawand order. If security is threatened, in a way to impede or imperil our militaryoperations, we should not hesitate to reimpose military government either in wholeor in part. Subject to these provisos and to our retaining control in all essentialmilitary matters, our handing over of administration to the Italian Governmentin Italian Government Italy should be far-reaching and sincere.4.   The following steps should be taken to implement this plan : (i) The Political Section of the Allied Commission should be abolished andthe British and American Embassies in Rome made responsible fortendering political advice to the Allied Commission,(ii) The Allied Commission should confirm to the Italian Government thatthey may have direct relations with foreign representatives.accreditedto the Quirinal. We always recognised that the estabishment of direct relations between Italy and Britain and America would lead to similar developments in the relations between Italy and other Powers.But the Italians should be told that they will be expected to keep usgenerally informed on any negotiations in which they may engage.(iii) Italian representatives abroad should be given their own cyphers, and allied and neutral representatives in Rome should be permitted theuse of cyphers. There can be no political objection to this step, andSACMED would first be consulted on the security point of view.(iv) The Allied Commission should surrender its control over Italian legisla-tion in Italian Government Italy. Our rights under the Armistice onthis point have never been very clearly defined, and if the ItalianGovernment wish to flout our advice we have no real power to make )them reconsider their decision without provoking widespread resent-ment. It would be better to rely upon friendly advice and, ifnecessary, strong pressure to secure our ends.(v) The right of approval by the Allied Commission of all Italian appoint-ments in Italian Government Italy should be surrendered except in
regard to military appointments. So far as subordinate appoint-ments are concerned the control of the Allied Commission has never been more than nominal. We should rely on friendly advice andpressure if appointments unacceptable to us seem to be contemplated.This technique was in fact used very recently in the case of CountSforza. New Ministers should, however, be required to confirm, as acondition of assuming office, that they will adhere to the obligations under the Armistice undertaken by their predecessors,(vi) Local officers of the Allied Commission should, be withdrawn from italian Government Italy. These officers are insufficient to govern,but sufficient to interfere. Their presence tends to weaken the sense of responsibility of the Italians and to allow the latter to pursue thecongenial plan of throwing upon us in the public opinion of theworld a responsibility which belongs to themselves. This will not prevent the Headquarters of the Allied Commission from sendingrepresentatives to any part of Italy as our interests may require.5. &quot; Demilitarisation &quot; of the Allied Commission has been recommended incertain circles. I cannot believe that those who propose rapid or wholesaledemilitarisation now have understood that three-quarters of the effort of theCommission is necessarily concentrated on those parts of Italy which are either under the control of Allied Military Government or will be when they are vacatedby Marshal Kesselring. Allied Military Government can only be carried on by officers in uniform. When the enemy have been driven out of all Italian territory and the first shock has been taken by the Allied Military Government organi-sation in the rear of our advancing armies, all Italy (except perhaps certaindisputed provinces, such as Venezia Giulia) will in due course be returned to italian Government administration. Then the Commission can be almost entirely&quot; civilianised.&quot;6. But while demilitarisation in the field will not be practicable, I am infavour of this process to a considerable extent at Headquarters. This is being done. But certain positions, for technical reasons, must be held by officers of oneof the Services. And the fact that officers in the field will have to be in uniformwill limit the extent to which civilians should be introduced to Headquarters. Itwill be desirable to send officers from Headquarters into the field and vice versa.We must have flexibility.7. If my proposals are approved, I will recommend, at a later date, certain changes in the personnel and structure of the Commission necessary to carrythem out.ANNEX II.Economic Policy in Italy.*At their thirty-first meeting on the 9th August, 1944, the Official Committeeon Armistice Terms and Civil Administration invited the Official Committee on supply Questions in Liberated and Conquered Areas to consider whether a new policy was desirable in regard to economic and supply arrangements for Italy;and, if so, what that policy should be. SACMED also has asked for guidance,if only temporary, as to the next immediate stage in our attitude towards Italianeconomic affairs.2. Having considered the question with the Government Departmentsconcerned, the S.L.A.O. Committee conclude that a new economic and supplypolicy in regard to Italy is now necessary.3. Up to the present the principles upon which the Allied control commission in Italy has been basing its administration of the country have been,broadly speaking, those applicable to the &quot; military period.&quot; The standardadopted has been that of &quot; the minimum essential for the prevention of disease and unrest &quot; but the actual levels of supplies provided for this purpose were not designed to meet even the minimum needs of a country over any long period.A less rigorous application seems necessary if &apos;&apos; disease and unrest&apos;&apos; are still to be prevented.4. Italian economy, at least in the south, has reached a stage where it isin the interests of the Allies to include among their aims that of making Italy asfar as possible independent of the imported foodstuffs and necessary consumer* S.L.A.O. (44) 145 Revise, as amended by telegram NOD. 401.
goods which have to be provided and shipped by the Allies. Moreover, these supplies have to be sent to Italy on credit and it is unlikely that they will bepaid for, except perhaps in small measure. The implementation of the policy of&quot; prevention of disease and unrest &quot; in the initial stages of military occupationnecessarily involves importing supplies for civilian populations in the shape of foodstuffs and finished goods. But this first stage is passing and it is possiblenow to take a longer view. Supplies of raw materials and equipment should beprovided where possible to enable Italian labour aiid productive capacity to ),supply her own population with essential requirements.This policy should, however, be subject to two limitations. First, inasmuch as supplies and shipping are limited, there may well be other countries with betterclaims to such assistance than Italy. Secondly, in some cases it would beunjustifiable, solely to meet a short-term need, to provide Italy with any appreciable amount of new equipment at a time when exporting industries inthe Allied countries are still heavily handicapped by continuing war production.5. Italy is unlikely to be able to make any important contribution of supplies to the war effort of the Allies or the relief needs of Europe in the near future.But where the Combined Boards or other appropriate authorities recommend thata specific Italian industry should be assisted in the interests of the Allies toproduce a surplus above the minimum of needs of the Italian population, theItalian import programme&apos; should be allowed to include the raw materials andequipment for this purpose. Any such export surplus will have the beneficial effect of helping to pay for essential imports.6. The Allied Control Commission and the Italian authorities are in thebest position to judge whether a particular plant falling within an approvedindustrial category can be put back into working order. Their report and estimates of repair materials, and, where necessary, raw materials, needed shouldbe made known to the authorities in London and Washington as soon as possible.There may be cases, however, where a plant, while not producing civilian goods of an essential character, might, with a very small amount of assistance, be quickly brought back into production. If, in the opinion of the Supreme allied commander, the commodity in question would, proportionately to the importsrequired, be a valuable addition to civilian supplies for any special reason,e.g., anti-inflation, it should be open to them to submit a special recommendationso that London and Washington may give final consideration on the merits ofthe case.7. The S.L.A.O. Committee consider, therefore, that the following fourprinciples should guide the activities of the authorities in the field who areresponsible for advising on and controlling Italian economy : &apos;(a) Subject to the military requirements of the Supreme Allied Commanderwhich must be paramount, .the Italian Government should be encouraged to take an increasingly responsible part in conductingItalian economic affairs.(&amp;) Italy should be encouraged to become as self-sufficient as possible inregard to supplies which she draws from the United Nations.(c) An effort should be made to raise her standard of living, but not to onehigher than those current in the territories of the Allies or at theexpense of their legitimate requirements. So far as possible thisshould be achieved by a better use of indigenous resources.id) The Italian Government should be aided and encouraged to restart those industries which will provide goods that the appropriate Alliedauthorities agree shall be supplied by Italy for the war effort or reliefneeds of Europe.8. It is understood that the Allied Control Commission and A.F.H.Q. arenow working on a 12 months&apos; import programme drawn up in conjunction withthe Italian authorities. In the absence of information, it is not yet possibleto consider the basis on which it has been drawn up. But to implement the aboveprinciples, the programme should include, in addition to supplies needed under sub-paragraphs 8 (&amp;) and (d) above, materials and repair equipment to maintain in operation transport and utility services and any other items where specialjustification exists.9. The programme should be submitted simultaneously to London and washington for further screening and for recommendation&apos; to the Combinedauthorities.
