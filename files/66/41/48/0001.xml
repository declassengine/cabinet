The demand for the Royal Navy can be divided into main categories asfollows : Men-(a) To man new construction (other than landing ships and craft)   ...      ...&quot;(b) Expansion of the F.A.A. (including maintenance and flying personnel for service afloat in new ships and general service personnel for Naval AiStations)     ...       ...       ...       ...(c) Officers  ...\d) Combined Operations and landing ships and craft.(e) Miscellaneous requirements   ...(/) Replacement of wastageTotal     ...........Or say     ...      ...Women (g) W.R.N.S.-Expansion of shore bases at home and abroad ...Replacement of wastage   ...(A) Nursing service Nursing sistersV.A.Ds.TotalGrand Total (Men and Women)104,214*37,05014,58510.15027,92053,000246,919247,00032.0008,00040.0003001,2001,500288,500* This figure.excludes 5,000 men who, under the plans so far adopted, would be found fromthe Merchant Navy to form part of the complements of Escort Carriers. If the Ministry ofWar Transport cannot provide them the present Naval demand will have to be increasedaccordinglj&apos;.[26221] B
3.   Detailed comments on each of these categories arc as follows : (a) NeioConstruction.The manning of ships* due to complete for the Royal Navy both at home andabroad is the biggest single item. It results from programmes already approved in order to enable the Navy to attain a strength commensurate with Britishstrategic responsibilities at sea. The largest vessels due to complete within theperiod in question are 7 Light Fleet Carriers and 4 Cruisers. Provision has to he made for 270 Frigates and Corvettes. The only item which does not flow frompast decisions is the manning of the large number of repair ancl maintenance ships which will be essential to ensure the mobility of the Fleet in the Far East, and is anunavoidable consequence of the policy of exerting the maximum effort against japan that we are capable of. while still concentrating on the war againstGermany.(b) Fleet. A ir A rm.Similar considerations apply to the Fleet Air Arm. The realisation of the approved expansion will lie all the more necessary in view of the probability thatwe shall be faced with concurrent demands for escort carriers for trade protection,for sea-borne air support for combined operations and for a large naval air elementfor the Far Eastern Fleet.(c) Officers.The total of 14,585 includes those to be obtained by direct entry from civil life as well as those promoted from the lower deck, who will need to be replaced.It is the smallest number that will provide the requisite quota of officers to match the approved expansion of the Fleet.(d) Combined Operations.The total of 10.150 is made up of two elements :  For the manning of certain special landing ships    ...       6,550For the manning of landing craft ancl for specialunits required in Combined Operations ...       3,600Experience has shown that the estimation of requirements for combined operations is extremely difficult, not merely because the number of craft to fiemanned will be influenced by the scale of losses in operations, but also becauserequirements for ancillary tasks must vary greatly according to the circumstancesof each particular operation ancl often cannot be predicted in detail much inadvance. These figures are. however, the best estimate we can make of ourminimum requirements. They are based on two assumptions, (i) that the strengthof our combined operation forces will be stabilised at the level to be reached on the1st May, 1944. (ii) that any balance outstanding from the requirement for some25,000t men, which remained after the final man-power allocations for the rest of1943 were settled last July, will be met in full by the other two services, ancl thatany advance contributions made by the Navy towards this figure will be made good out of the Army and R.A.F. allocations.(e) Miscellaneous requirements.These are made up of a number of minor requirements (such as improvements in ships&apos; Radar, Royal Marine Engineers, defensive equipment in merchant ships,special repair ratings for overseas, new bases, merchant navy trainees) for which provision must be made. Every item has been carefully scrutinised and demandsreduced to a minimum.(f) Wastage:For this purpose, the average for the whole of the war 5  per cent, perannum has been adopted, except for Combined Operations and Royal Marineland commitments. For these a much higher rate of battle casualties must beexpected in future, and rates of 13 per cent, and 20 per cent, respectively havebeen assumed.* The ships to be manned total over 850 (including coastal craft but excluding other small craft) and have an aggregate tonnage of 1,650,000 displacement tons,j This later became 20,675.
(g) W.R.N.S.This estimate is based upon the fullest exploitation of the policy of placingwomen in as many shore jobs as possible. The aim has been to keep to theminimum the demand for men for the expansion of existing bases and the manning of new bases which will be required for the expanded fleet and the growing range of operations.(h) Nursing -Services.The total of 1,500, which may appear on the high side, is necessary becauseof a deficiency of entries in 1943, because the short supply of medical officersmust be compensated for by an adequacy of trained nursing sisters and V.A.Ds.,and because the Navy has recently been going through, and will continue to go through a period of large expansion. To a certain extent V.A.Ds. replace malesick berth attendants.General Comments on the Naval demand.4. 1 recognise that in the present man-power stringency the total of288,501) is a formidable one, but I am satisfied that it is essential in the presentsituation of the war at sea.5. The threat to our sea communications is not diminished. The german-boat fleet, in spite of its recent heavy losses, is at least maintaining its numbers and we must expect that this form of attack on our ships will go on spreadingfurther and further afield. As our effort in the Tar Eastern theatre grows,we shall have much more at stake in those distant waters. The enemy are showing-considerable ingenuity in the development both of defensive measures for them-boats and of new weapons for attack on ships, by aircraft as well as sub-marines. The Axis powers know, as well as we do, that their only remainingchance of success is to cripple our sea-communications, and immediately we find(lie answer to a particular weapon or method of attack they will return withsome new device or tactics.0. The surrender of most of the major units of the Italian Fleet admittedlyrepresents some alleviation of our Naval tasks; but in fact this relief is at leastcounter-balanced by the need to deploy as soon as possible against Japan theBritish naval forces so released, and this in an area where no well developedbase facilities at present exist. 1 Thus the German threat to our sea communica-tions will have to be dealt with concurrently with great amphibious operations,all making heavy demands on our Naval strength, and the waging of a vigorouswar against the third greatest Naval power in the world. There is no doubtthat the war against Japan will entail the operation of powerful naval andamphibious forces at great distances from any established bases. It will therefore involve heavy commitments for the establishment of new bases and forthe creation of a large train of repair, depot and store ships, all of which willhave to be manned to give the Fleet and its amphibious circus the mobility theywill need.7. We are now reaping, and throughout 1944 should continue to reap, thebenefit of past programmes rightly designed to ensure the expansion of thefighting fleet. If the men are not forthcoming to man the new ships, it will benecessary to pay off at least an equivalent number of existing vessels. If this were forced upon us, not only would the Fleet fail to achieve the increased strengthnecessary for the fulfilment of its tasks, but much of the effort put into the repair and production of warships in recent months and even years would be wasted.8. The figures now put forward contain no margin for unforeseen commit-ments, which have always proved heavy in the past. The present demands havebeen drawn up on the assumption that the Royal Navy will receive in full itsallocation for the current year. If there is any deficit in 1943 it will add to the requirement in 1944.9. Finally, in relation to our naval needs, we consider it would be unsafeto assume that the German effort at sea will be materially diminished beforeGermany is in fact defeated. In any case, it is highly probable that, so long asJapan remains undefeated, the men who could be released upon the collapse ofGermany would be mainly those in shore jobs and unfit for sea, so that the needfor able-bodied young recruits would be much less affected than might at first sight be supposed. I therefore consider that the only safe way in which to planour naval requirements for 1944 is to ignore the possibility of Germany being[26221] b 2
defeated during that period, and to review the requirements of men for the Navylater on, if the situation in Europe should develop so favourably as to make someretrenchment appear feasible.INDUSTRIA L REQ.U IR EMENTS.10. The net increase of 77,500 workers for which 1 have asked is sub-dividedas follows :  Contract Labour- Men. Women.Shipyards     ............       ... 15,000 10,000Supporting Industries (Engineering and allied Explosives, Chemicals)  ...&quot;    ...      9,500 25.000-f 3,000   administrative and clerical staff.Direct Labour Dockyards.    Armament    Depots,    StoreDepots, and miscellaneous establishments      6,600 8.400Contract Labour Shipyards.11.   The increase of 25.000 men and women in the shipyards would be allocated thus . Naval new construction ...       ...       ... ...       ...       5,500Merchant new construction     ...       ... ...       ...       5,000Naval repairs     ...       ...       ...       ... ...       ...      7,500Merchant repairs        ...       ...       ... ...       ...      7.()()()Total   ......    25,000(a) Naval New Construction.As will be apparent from paragraphs 4 to 7 above, the Admiralty considerthat planned progress should be maintained in the execution of Naval new construction programmes during 1944. In particular this means the full manningup of the frigate and corvette programme already in hand.(b) Merchant New Construction.The Admiralty remain under the obligation of achieving an output of1.100,000 tons a year. As my colleagues will remember, it has been necessary forthe sake of the escort, vessel programme to take over slips formerly used for merchant shipbuilding. In order to restore this loss sufficiently to preserve areasonable prospect of achieving the target output in the face of the many otherextraneous tasks placed on the merchant yards, it will be necessary, we estimate,to increase their labour force by 5,000 in 1944.(c) Repairs.The additional numbers required for Naval and Merchant repairs are thenatural consequence of the growth of the Fleet and of the increased number ofMerchant harbours.  An expansion of the ship-repairing industry of this order will be essential if there are not to be serious delays to the heavyprogramme of modernisation required, as well as in putting damaged ships back into service. This will be all the more important if, as seems probable, sea-borneoperations are conducted on an increased scale next year.(d) Need for Skilled Men.I must add the warning that the continuing call-up of skilled workers fromthe shipyards has already created a difficult position, especially on the repairside of the industry, where it is less easy to make good use of dilutees andunskilled labour.Contract Labour Supporting industries.12. The numbers required in the supporting industries are the naturalreflection of the demands created in the engineering and equipment-manufac-turing industries by the additional shipyard work contemplated both in thebuilding yards and in the repair yards, including the Royal Dockyards. Also, aconsiderable programme of modernisation of His Majesty&apos;s ships in fighting
equipment is projected to enable the Fleet to oner-ate with th*jlnanese waters   This will lead to heavy i^lSS^^^SZSSLSindustries (e.g., fire control gear). LLhlll-y ^peeiausectDirect Labour.1:3.   The increase in this held would be allocated thus:-Additional ship repair work in the dockyards ... 4,000Personnel for the other branches      ...      ... ... 4,500Inspections Department        ...       ...      ... ... 3,000Aircraft repair ...       ...       ...       ...       ... ... 1,500Miscellaneous establishments   ...       ...      ... ... 2,00015,000Royal Dockyards.14. The increase in dockyard complements follows from the growing increasein repair work already mentioned. It will be difficult to obtain the full valueof the increase in this item unless a considerable number of skilled men can beincluded in the figure of 4.000 which the full programme of expansion requires.Other Direct Labour.15. As the number of ships to be provided with aircraft, ammunition,stores, food and clothing increases, the demands of the Store Depots for staffinevitably expand accordingly. A great deal of this class of work is carried outin the other Services by uniformed personnel. The requirements of the Inspec-tions Department are due very largely to a projected increase of 100 per cent,in the production of Oerlikon shell by the Ministry of Supply. The aircraftrepair yards require 1,500 persons to utilise their capacity to the full and maintain a proper percentage of serviceable aircraft.Possible Effect of Far Eastern War on Industrial Requirements.16. The stage reached in planning for the war in the Far East shows that alarge volume of ships of all kinds will be needed. To provide them, equip themand maintain them will require a considerable increase in the shipyard labour force (and associated industries) both in this country and in operational repairbases abroad, the skilled men for which have to come from this country. The dataavailable is not yet sufficient to enable a reliable estimate to be given of possiblefurther requirements under this head.Non-Industrial Civil Requirements.17. The requirements for non-industrial civil staff at Headquarters and out-ports, which are of great importance, will be considered as part of the global needs for Government service which are, I understand, being dealt with separately by theChancellor of the Exchequer.A.
