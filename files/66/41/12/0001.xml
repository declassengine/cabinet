(43) 412.22nd September, 1943.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED FOUR-POWER DECLARATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. On the 6th September the War Cabinet considered the Four-power declaration proposed by the United States Government. Subsequently, after an exchange of telegrams with the Prime Minister, the United States draft and ourcomments thereon were communicated to Dominion Prime Ministers. I append(Annex I) my telegrams to the Dominions, and (Annex II) the replies sincereceived.2.   In general, the Dominions have welcomed the proposed declaration.   The.following are the main points which arise from their replies:  (1) Clause 5. The Canadian Government suggest that this should be amended so as to impose an obligation on the Four Powers to consult not onlyeach other but also other United Nations. They have also suggested an amendment to Clause 8 with the same object. I consider it very satisfactorythat Canada is willing to agree to an instrument establishing general leader-ship by the Four Powers, and I hope that we can meet them on the questionof putting the smaller countries somewhere in the picture. The principle is one to which Canada attaches great importance, and. quite apart from canada&apos;s position, there is much to be said for bringing out more clearly inthe document that the Great Powers are acting with the assent of the smaller .Powers and in consultation with them where practicable. The Canadianform of words is, in my view, open to objection, but I suggest that we should agree to sponsor some amendment to cover the point.(2) General Smuts suggests the omission of &quot;&apos; jointly.&quot; Whether or not we accept this amendment turns on the balance which we strike between therespective risks of (a) independent action by one of the signatories, and(b) inaction by all resulting from disagreement. On the whole, I should prefer to leave the clause as it stands.(3) Clause 4. Both Canada and South Africa suggest drafting amerid-ments, Canada with the object of emphasising the part of the smaller Powers,while South Africa takes the opposite view. A compromise might bepossible by applying the South African amendment to the Canadian draft asfollows :  &quot; That they recognise the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organisation, based on theprinciple of the sovereign equality of all Nations, for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security, in which all peace-loving nations, great and small, may play their part.&quot;But this would involve a reversion to the phrase &quot; the principle of the sovereign equality of all nations &quot; originally proposed by the United States.[26116]b
(4) Participants.(a) &quot;United Kingdom&quot; or &quot;British Commonwealth&quot;? TheAustralian Government propose that &quot;The British Commonwealth ofNations &quot; should be named and treated as one of the four Great Powers.This may be related to Mr. Curtin&apos;s recent proposals for the closer integration of the British Commonwealth politically. The idea, which is a reversion tothe Paris Peace Conference arrangement of 1919. is superficially attractive,but in view of the express disapproval of this conception at the ImperialConference of 1926 by the Dominions themselves, there is little prospect of its acceptance, at any rate by Canada and South Africa. Actually we should,of course, under our existing system, consult fully with the Dominions before-hand in all matters of major importance, and Australia^ desire would thus in substance, though not in form, be secured. In other words, we should appear as the United Kingdom but should present a British commonwealth and Empire policy. But we could not undertake a formal commitment thaton every occasion action must be held up until we had reached complete agreement with each of the Dominions, and on the other hand the dominions would insist on retaining a final say in their foreign policy. For these reasons, I regard the Australian suggestion as impracticable, and would propose to explain the position to them accordingly.(b) China. Australia demurs to the inclusion of China on the ground of her inability to fulfil the obligations proposed to be undertaken. Butit is not clear that they wish to press the point, and they recognise theimportance, from the point of view of opinion in the United States, of including China. I take it that the only possible reply here is that, in viewof United States opinion, the inclusion of China seems to us essential.3. I would ask my colleagues to decide how far they are willing to go tomeet the above points. When they have done so, I will reply to the DominionGovernments, indicating how much we are prepared to accept of their suggestions,explaining why we cannot go further to meet their views, and expressing our willingness to take up the accepted points at the Three-Power meeting.C. R. A.Dominions Office,22nd September. 1943.ANNEX I (1).Dominions Office Telegram of 13th September to Dominion Governments.(D. No. 650.  Most Secret and Personal.)Following for Prime Minister :  President Roosevelt recently communicated to Prime Minister informally text of a suggested Four-Power Declaration by the United States, United Kingdom.Russia and China in the terms set out in my immediately following telegram.Discussion between the President and Prime Minister has proceeded on the basisof the possibility of the document being included on agenda of forthcomingThree-Power meeting of Foreign Ministers referred to in my telegram D. No. 623of 6th September. If this is decided upon, procedure would, we expect, be thatthe United States Government would formally communicate draft to us and tothe Russians simultaneously before the Conference takes place.Meanwhile the Cabinet here have been giving preliminary consideration tothe document. In general the Cabinet cordially welcome declaration of this naturein view of the great advantages which it would have in proclaiming interest ofUnited States in post-war system and in linking up Soviet Russia with UnitedStates and ourselves in a joint policy for future security.We should be grateful if we could receive the earliest possible expression ofyour views on this proposal. In view of the importance of the issue we are naturally anxious to have the fullest possible consultation with the DominionGovernments in the matter before the United Kingdom representative deals with it at the proposed Three-Power Conference.
On points of detail it has occurred to us that paragraphs 3 and 4 might readbetter as follows : &quot; 3. That they will take all measures deemed by them to be necessary toprovide against any violation of the terms imposed upon the enemy.4. That they recognise the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organisation for the maintenanceof international peace and security based on the principle of the sovereignequality of nations.&quot; .It has further occurred to us that the last few words of paragraph 4 in theUnited States draft might be an embarrassment in the future since they might encourage the smaller Powers to hope that in the future planning for Europe theywill be treated as in all respects equivalent to the larger Powers. It is, of course,important to avoid the impression that the greater Powers would ride roughshodover the smaller Powers, and this could, it seems to us, be achieved equally wellby somewhat different wording such as &quot;. . . . a general international organisa-tion for the maintenance of international peace and security in which all peace-loving nations, great and small, may play their just part.&quot;It is probable that these amendments will be put forward by us at theThree-Power meeting, but generally we think it important to adhere as closely as possible to the wording proposed by the United States.Very grateful if we could receive your views at the earliest possible date.ANNEX I (2).Dominions Office Telegram of YZth September to Dominion Governments.(D. No. 651.   Most Secret and Personal.)Following for Prime Minister :  My immediately pieceding telegram.   Following is text:  The Governments of the United States. Great Britain, the Soviet Union and china, united in their determination, in accordance with the Declaration by theUnited Nations of the 1st January, 1942, and subsequent Declarations, to continuehostilities against those Axis Powers with which they respectively are at waruntil such Powers have laid down their arms on the basis of unconditional surrender, conscious of their responsibilities to secure the liberation of themselves and the people allied with them from the menace of aggression, recognising thenecessity of ensuring a rapid and orderly transition from war to peace and ofestablishing and maintaining international peace and security with the leastdiversion of the world&apos;s human and economic resources for armaments, jointlydeclare 1. That their united action, pledged for the prosecution of the war, will becontinued for the organisation and maintenance of peace and security.2, That those of them at war with a common enemy will act together in all matters relating to the surrender and disarmament of that enemy, and to anyoccupation of enemy territory and of territory of other States held by that enemy.3. That they will take ail measures deemed by them to be necessary to provide against any violation of the requirements imposed upon their present enemies.4. That they recognise the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicabledate a general international organisation, based on the principle of the sovereignequality of all nations, and open to membership by all nations, large and small,for the maintenance of international peace and security.5. That for the purpose of maintaining international peace and securitypending the re-establishment of law and order and the inauguration of a generalsystem of security, they will consult and act jointly on behalf of the community of nations.6. That, in connection with the foregoing purpose, they will establish a technical commission to advise them on the militaiy problems involved, includingthe composition and strength of the forces available in an emergency arising froma. threat to the peace.7. That they will not employ their military forces within the territories ofother States except for the purposes envisaged in this Declaration and after joint consultation and agreement.8. That they will confer and co-operate to bring about a practicable generalagreement with respect to the regulation of armaments in the post-war period.[26116]
ANNEX II (2).Telegram of ldth September from A ustralian Government.(No. 244.)YOUR telegrams D. No. 650 and D. No. 651.It appears to us that the positive value of a declaration of the nature proposedlies in the fact that the three main military powers, viz., British Commonwealth.United States and Soviet Russia, would definitely commit themselves to post-warcollaboration, and to policing the peace settlement.2. But the terms of obligations are of such a nature that it is extremely doubtful whether China could be regarded as capable of fulfilling them. For thisreason, the declaration might lose much of its positive effect if China is included.3. It may have been politic from the point of view of public opinion in theUnited States that China should be proposed as a party to the declaration. Itis noticeable that it is not proposed that China should be represented at the three-power conference where the proposed declaration is to be listed, and we doubt theinclusion of China in the declaration.4. From the point of view of effectiveness of weight, and of avoidance of future difficulties, we -believe that the three major powers only should be associated, viz., the United States, the British Commonwealth of Nations and theSoviet Union. We appreciate that this entails prior agreement between themembers of the British Commonwealth, but, if they cannot agree amongst them-selves, it is obvious that wider agreement is impossible.5.   As to the terms of the proposed declaration :  (a) We agree to your amendment paragraph 3.(b) We agree to your first proposed amendment paragraph 4.We are not prepared to agree to your second suggested amendment to paragraph 4.The words il peace loving &quot; and &quot; just part &quot; may give rise to untold difficulties.They may well be regarded as permanently excluding present enemy powers fromfuture participation, and also as contradicting a basic principle of internationallaw, viz.. the general principle of equality of States.Telegram of 17tk September from Canadian Government.(No. 147.   Most Secret and Personal.)YOUR telegrams I). No. 650 and I). No. 651 of L3th September. Four-power declaration.The Canadian Government welcomes the suggestion that there should be adeclaration by the leading powers along the general lines set forth in the UnitedStates proposals.2. The text as proposed by the United States is generally acceptable. Weprefer your wording of Clause 3. With regard to Clause 4 we would suggest afusion of the United States and United Kingdom drafts as follows : &quot; That they recognise the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organisation based on the principle of sovereign equality of all nations for the maintenance of international peace and security in which allpeace-loving Nations, great and small, may play their just pail.&quot;&apos;3. Clause 5 of the United States draft appears to be open to the objectionof excluding from consultation all Powers other than the four signatories. Wewould suggest amending it as follows : &quot; They will consult with one another andwith other members of the United Nations acting jointly on behalf of the com-mimity of Nations.&quot; This suggestion would take into account the proposals inyour telegram* D. No. 365 of 19th June for the United Nations commission for europe.4. We assume that the declaration set forth in Clause 6 will not impairexisting arrangements with regard to consultation on military questions.5. We would suggest that Clause 8, be amended to read : &quot; That they willconfer and co-operate with one another and with other members of the united nations to bring about a practicable general agreement with respect to regulationof armaments in post-war period.&quot;* This reproduced paragraph -I (A) to (K) of W.P. (43) 217.
6. We regard paragraph 5 as of crucial importance. We consider that, inorder to agree to it. Australia should, either separately or as part of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations, he definitely included as one of the parties to acton behalf of the community of nations.Appropriate drafting should make it certain that Australia is included inthe connotation of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Our view is Miafc, inthis and analogous matters, it is desirable to give recognition to the british dominions, who have contributed so much-to the Empire war effort during thepast four years. The view is held to some extent in Australia that this principle is very very important, otherwise our status rnav decline to the position existingbefore the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. It is desirable to keep in mind thatin 1926 the Balfour declaration asserted the equality of status of british dominions with the United Kingdom in external affairs.&apos;7. Paragraph 5 of the declaration goes to the root of the proposal. Wetherefore regard it as essential that the views we have expressed in paragraph of this message should be given effect to in form as well as in fact.ANNEX II (3).Telegram of 16th September from New Zealand Government.(No, 398.   Most Secret and Personal.)Your telegrams D. Nos. 650 and 651.His Majesty&quot;s Government in New Zealand are fully in accord with the suggested Four Power Declaration and they have no objections to offer to the drafting amendments which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdompropose to put forward at the forthcoming meeting.ANNEX II (4).Letter of 15th September from High Commissioner for the Union ofSouth Africa.(Most Secret.)My dear Secretary of State.General Smuts has telegraphed with reference to your circular telegramsD. Nos. 650 and 651 of the 13th September (W.R. 208/25), asking me to let you know, for Mr. Churchiirs information, that he is in agreement with the Americandraft of the suggested Four Power Declaration by the United States, UnitedKingdom, Russia and China, as amended in the second of the two telegramsmentioned.My Prime Minister suggests, however, that in paragraph 4 of the Britishamendment the word &quot; just &apos;&quot; before &quot; part &quot; be deleted, as it may again mean&quot; equal &quot; and open the door to the pretensions of the small Powers which madethe League of Nations unworkable. The wording would therefore read &quot; .... a general international organisation for the maintenance of international peace and security in which all peace-loving nations great and small may play their part.&quot;My Prime Minister also suggests that in paragraph 5 of the Americandraft the word &quot; jointly &quot; be deleted as joint action may mean action by thefour Powers must be joint, and that if there is no unanimity the others areabsolved from taking action at all.Yours sincerely,DENEYS REITZ.
