rHIG DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-- 171Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SEC/RET. Copy No.     o2W.P. (43) 445.(;/// October, 1943.WAR CABINET.INDIAN POLICY.Memorandum by the Prtme Minister and Minister of Defence.1. Since the Cripps&apos; offer was made in March 1942, important events have occurred. The Japanese menace of invasion of India came to a head. Gandhidid his utmost to weaken the defence of the country and to hamper the BritishGovernment. He raised the cry of &quot; Quit India ! &quot; and made it clear that he was prepared to co-operate with Japan. In all this he was supported by the Congressmachine. Not content with exposing India to the frightful disaster of anunresisted Japanese invasion, he and the Congress raised a serious rebellion in theform of Civil Disobedience, causing some loss of life and hindrance to the war effort.2. However, the successful progress of the war against Japan has removed,the clanger of invasion for the time being, and the improvement in our affairs inlairope has further weakened the position of Japan. India has therefore beenspared the horrors of Japanese subjugation. The measures taken against theCongress leaders restored internal order. They are now confined under easyconditions but without any immediate power to hamper our defence. their action in this crisis has greatly disciedited them, not only in India but among theAllies and particularly the United States where, except for the Clare Lucemovement, there is no demand for further British surrenders of executive power at this time. Gandhi&apos;s attempt by pretending to fast unto death to intimidate theGovernment of India into submission being firmly faced, brought further ridiculeupon him. In all my visits to America, I have never been asked a single question about India.3. . We are now preparing very important offensives operations from Indiaagainst Japan for the campaign of 1944, and large British and Americanresources are being employed.   There could hardly be a less suitable time for
raising again the political agitation on its old and well-known lines, and !&apos;ortrying to form a responsible Government based in the main on Gandhi. If sucha course is adopted, we must expect a grave renewal of agitation throughout \India, the future of every race, class, creed and party being thrown into the melting-pot at a time when there is a serious food shortage in some Provinces, and &apos;when we have an enormously swollen Indian Army of a very much lower qualitythan we have ever seen before. It would seem that the injury to our war effort anildiscipline and to the internal peace of India might be most grievous.4. The fact that a new Viceroy is going out to India affords no reason forrunning such risks. If they have to be run, it should lie upon broad and solidgrounds of public policy and not at a time fixed by the movements of an individual. On the contrary, it might be thought that the Viceroy would dowell to establish himself in bis new responsibilities, and that this would be amatter at any rate of several months and not merely of weeks. If in say sixmonths&apos; or a vear&apos;s time we received from Lord Wavell the advice that he feltunable to maintain conditions in India satisfactory to the military operations against Japan without negotiating with Mr. Gandhi and the Congress, a very grave issue would arise which we should have to consider on its merits. Weshould also probably by then be in a stronger position in Europe through theprogress of our arms, and the offensive against Japan from India would helaunched and might bring us successes. It would therefore be a very seriousstep to jeopardize the situation by ourselves opening the whole constitutionalissue at this juncture, and I trust my colleagues will most carefully weigh allthe issues, some of which may be fundamental, before taking a plunge of this character. We shall certainly not be in a worse position to deal with theconstitutional position in India after we have beaten Germany and Japan, andhave revived the prestige of our arms in Burma and Malaya, than we areat the present time, when we ought to devote ourselves wholeheartedly tothe prosecution of the war. Victory is the best foundation for great eonstitii-tional departures.W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,6th October, 1943.
