THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,   October 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 438.5th October, 1943.WAR CABINET.WESTERN FRONTIERS OF THE U.S.S.R.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN December 1941, Stalin informed me that he regarded the question of theU.S.S.R.&apos;s western frontiers &quot;as the main question for us in the war.&quot; Webelieve that this is still the Soviet view, although the question has not been raised from the Soviet side in recent months.2 The Soviet attitude in our forthcoming discussions on the future settlement of Europe will theiefore presumably be very much influenced by our views about their western frontiers.3. The question has in any case become one of imminent practical importancewith the approach of the Soviet armies to the former Polish frontier. the resulting problems will be very difficult to handle unless we and the other Govern-ments concerned know where each stands in the matter.4. Soviet territorial claims can be divided into those affecting (a) poland and (b) other countries, viz : (1) the Baltic States, (2) Finland and (3) Roumania.(a) Poland.5. On various occasions MM. Stalin, Molotov and Maisky have indicated that they would regard the Curzon Line with minor modifications as a satisfactory basis for a frontier settlement with Poland. We have hitherto maintained thatwe recognise no territorial changes which have been effected in Poland since August, 1939, but have given the Russians no more precise indication of our views.6. The Soviet-Polish frontier is the&quot; core of the problem. The PolishGovernments attitude is that they cannot accept during the course of the warany surrender of former Polish territory, without forfeiting the confidence ofthe Polish people at home or the loyalty of the Polish armed forces abroad(a matter of direct interest to us). We ourselves cannot enter into any agreement,written or unwritten, with the Soviet Government involving the surrender of polish territory, since we are bound by the assurances which we gave to Polandin July 1941, when the Soviet Polish Treaty was signed, and again in 1942, at thetime of the negotiations for an Anglo-Soviet Treaty (see annex).7. There are, however, signs that even the Polish Government do not wishto postpone consideration of this problem until the Soviet armies cross the august 1939 Polish frontier. Decisions must be taken soon regarding the attitudeof the well-organised Polish underground forces to the Russians and vice-versa.I am circulating a separate paper to my colleagues on this question. The problemof resuming Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations will then become acute. Weshall be faced with a deadlock on all such issues unless, without abandoningour principle of not recognising during the war any territorial changes, we canshow the Soviet Government that we do not intend to oppose their essentialterritorial aims in the west,8. I suggest that our policy should be not to oppose the Soviet claim thatthe Curzon Line should form the basis of the new Soviet-Polish frontier, butto make every effort to secure a modification whereby the City of Lwow wouldbe included in Poland. The further Polish claim to Vilna, to which they alsoattach the greatest importance, would be unrealisable, if only for geographicalreasons. We might, however, emphasise to the Soviet Government the importance12170   [26194]Copy No.
attached to Vilna by the Poles and use it as a bra-gaining counter to secure atleast Lwow for them. Poland should receive as compensation in the west, Danzig,East Prussia and Upper Silesia. The Soviet Government have consistentlyfavoured these arrangements at the expense of Germany. These territorialchanges might involve substantial transfers of population.9. At Quebec I discussed the above proposal with Mr. Hull. He said thatit raised difficult issues but that the matter would have to be considered as theSoviet Government would be sure to raise it at any discussion of post-war matters.Mr. Hopkins told me that he knew President Roosevelt&apos;s mind about Russia&apos;sfrontiers was almost exactly the same as mine and that the President had already said as much to M. Molotov and M. Litvinov.10. I am, however, by no means confident that the United States Governmentwould formally endorse the views which the President has apparently expressed.Mr. Cordell Hull, who will be my opposite number at the Moscow talks, isparticularly likely to hold back on this issue. The United States Government have always taken a very firm line against the recognition of any territorial changeseffected by force and in an election year they will pay great attention to thewell-organised Polish vote of approximately three millions. On an issue of thiskind I consider it important that we should only act together with the UnitedStates Government, more particularly as we. unlike the United States Govern-ment, have treaty and other commitments to Poland. Otherwise the Poles willbe unable to resist the temptation to stir up opposition in the United States.11. The forthcoming &quot; Foreign Secretaries&apos; meeting &quot; is, however, a preliminary meeting to explore the ground and prepare the way for the forth-coming meeting between the Prime Minister, Premier Stalin and president roosevelt. I suggest, therefore, for the approval of my colleagues, that without committing His Majesty!s Government, I should use the opportunity afforded bythe Moscow talks to explore the position with a view to subsequent discussion at the meeting between the President and the two Prime Ministers. This coursewill have the advantages (1) that the President is likely to be more forthcomingthan Mr. Hull; and (2) it will give us time to see whether the Soviet advance islikely to take them as far as Poland this year.12. In exploring this question, which is in any case bound to come up atthe meeting, I should take the line with the Soviet Government thatI should like to know what they would do on their side if the PolishGovernment were prepared to accept a frontier settlement on the lines ofparagraph 8 above. I should indicate that if we decided not to oppose at the final settlement an arrangement as regards Poland on the lines set out in paragraph 8above and if the Poles were prepared to accept this, we should expect theSoviet Government to show a real willingness to co-operate in post-war matters in Europe and to demonstrate their good will by (1) resuming relations with thePolish Government; (2) co-operating with us and the Polish Government in finding a&apos;satisfactory solution to problems concerning (a) Polish undergroundresistance (see paragraph 7 above); (b) the position of Poles in the U.S.S.R.:(c) their support of the Union of Polish Patriots and of the rival Polish armyin the U.S.S.R. Soviet action on the above lines would go far to. remove the anxieties now being felt in Polish circles that the U.S.S.R. is not so muchinterested in frontier questions as in turning Poland into a puppet-State.13. I should feel bound, in view of our treaty and other commitments, toinform the Polish Government, before the Conference opens, that we intend to explore with the Soviet Government the question of Polish-Soviet relations, notexcluding the frontiers.(b) Other frontiers.(1) Baltic States.14. The Russians contend that the Baltic States voted themselves into theSoviet Union in the summer of 1940, and thus formed an integral part of theU.S.S.R. at the date of the German attack. There is not the smallest chance ofthe Russians abandoning any part of this claim. Further, when M. Molotov avusin this country in May 1942 His Majesty&apos;s Government expressed their willingness to sign a treaty containing a form of words which, it was agreed, constitutedrecognition by us of the Soviet claim to the Baltic States. The draft treaty thenunder discussion was not in fact signed as it was superseded by the Twenty YearsTreaty, in which nothing whatever was said about frontiers. But we are fullycommitted to the Soviet Government on this point in the records of the discussion-
(2) Finland.In December 1941, Stalin told me that he would like to see the frontier in Finland restored to its position in 1941 immediately before the outbreak ofwar. He said that he would also like an alliance with Finland giving the soviet union the right to maintain naval and military bases on Finnish territory. he further said that the Soviet Union had made a gift of Petsamo to Finland(presumably by not claiming it at the time of the Soviet-Finnish Peace inMarch 1940) and this gift they would now like to take back again because of the&quot;very bad behaviour of the Finns.&quot; In May 1942, M. Molotov repeated whatStalin had said (save that he made no reference to Petsamo) and emphasised that the Russians wished to return to the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of March 1940,and said that it was their intention that the Pact of Mutual Assistance (as he nowcalled the proposed &quot; alliance &quot; with the Finns referred to by Stalin) would include a guarantee of the independence of Finland. No further reference has since been made to Petsamo. The frontier of 1940 included Viborg in the soviet union; the island of Hango, which was leased to the Union of Soviet socialist republics for 30 years under the Soviet-Finnish treaty, and about which the finns are very sensitive, would certainly be one of the places where the russians would want a base. Last March President Roosevelt told me that he did not feel any difficulty now in agreeing to Russian demands about Finland.(3) Roumania.In December 1941, Stalin said that the Roumanian frontier should be soformed as to include Bessarabia and North Bukovina in the Soviet Union. he further said that the Western frontier of Roumania should be extended at theexpense of Hungary as there were in that area 1,250,000 Roumanians underHungarian rule. He made a proposal for an alliance between Roumania and theSoviet Union and for the establishment of military and naval bases on Roumanianterritory similar to his proposal in respect of Finland, and suggested that theSoviet-Roumanian alliance should guarantee Roumania against Hungary.M. Molotov in May 1942 spoke in the same sense. These Russian claims do not include any territory which was not included in their 1941 frontier. So far asI am aware the Americans have expressed no views on this question.15. There can be no quesUon of entering into any written agreement withthe Russians as regards any of these frontier claims. But I would ask mycolleagues to authorise me to conduct exploratory conversations with the soviet and United States representatives in the same spirit as I have already proposedin paragraphs 11 and 12 in connexion with the Polish-Soviet frontier on theassumption that, while we do not propose to reverse our decision not to recogniseany territorial changes made during the wrar. His Majesty&apos;s Government would,when the appropriate moment came, raise no objection to the Soviet claim to havethe 1941 position restored as regards their territorial claims in respect of Finland,the Baltic States and Roumania.(c) Other Points.16. I further ask my colleagues to agree that I should take the followingline with regard to other points that may arise :  (a) Provision should be made at the final settlement for inhabitants of anyterritories transferred thereunder to depart elsewhere with theirmovable property. This would help the Baltic settlement and alsothat of the Polish eastern frontiers, but would be of general applica-tion, and thus perhaps easier for the Russians to accept.(b) As regards probable Soviet proposals for alliances or mutual assistancepacts with Finland and Roumania, His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe prepared to consider these at the peace settlement.(c) The claim to Petsamo falls into a different category from other Sovietfrontier demands inasmuch as it was not included in the frontiers ofthe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the 22nd June, 1941; but his Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to consider this claimtoo if it is put forward at the peace settlement.A.
