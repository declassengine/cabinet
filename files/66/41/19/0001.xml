THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 419.27th September, 1943.WAR CABINET.AIRCRAFT CAPACITY FOR TROOPS&apos; MAILS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE Chairman of the Overseas Mails Committee and the Postmaster-General, in their Paper W.P. (43) 418 of the 23rd September, have invited theWar Cabinet (a) to increase immediately the weekly allocation for the carriage of troops&apos;mails by air from 15,000 lbs. to 20.000 lbs., and(b) to rule that in future air capacity shall automatically be provided forairgraphs and light-weight.air letters step by step with any and everyincrease in the postings.2. I agree, of course, that a fast and regular mail service is essential forthe maintenance of morale among our Forces overseas. I do not, however, agreethat this, can only be achieved, or, indeed, best be achieved, having regard toother urgent claims, by the use without limit of air transport as now advocated.3. In August 1942 the War Cabinet ruled that 6.000 lbs. of troops&apos;, mailshould be carried by air per week to the Middle East, and that it should have priority over all other loads. This allocation has since been increased progres-sively to 15.000 lbs. per week.The issue cannot be considered in relation only to the present demand for anincrease from 15,000 to 20.000 lbs. per week. The traffic is mounting rapidly and the figure of 20,000 will not suffice for long.4. When the original decision was taken, mails sent by sea to the middle east and beyond had to go via the Cape, and it took from four, to six months forthem to reach their destination. Then it was obvious that as much troops&apos; mailas possible should go by air at the expense inevitably of urgent military freightand personnel.5. The position is now different. The Mediterranean is again freely opento shipping and the surrender of the Italian Fleet has meant a considerableaccretion of vessels of various classes to our naval strength. The calls on air transport for communication and for operations, on the other hand, have growngreatly and are growing all the time.  Our resources are inadequate to meet them.6. Moreover, the carriage of troops&apos; mail to North Africa and the central mediterranean by air does not, in my view, offer sufficient advantages over the useof sea transport to justify the diversion of aircraft from our bomber or anti-L-boat offensives.7. In these circumstances, the best way of sending mail to our Forces in north Africa (west of Tripoli) and the Central Mediterranean would be to starta fast and regular service by ship. The average time of transit would be roughlythe same as by air if account is taken of the inevitable delays which bad weatherimposes on air communications.  The advantages are : (a) It will not be necessary to limit the size and weight of letters;(b) parcels from home, which mean so much to the troops and for which&apos;   carriage by air cannot possibly be provided, will be delivered more quickly; and[26145]
(c) aircraft capacity will become available (i) to carry  more passengers whose quick movement  is highly important for war purposes, ancl(ii) to improve the air mail service to Cairo and India. It is on the longer journeys that the time saved by air carriage becomes animportant factor in sustaining morale.8. I feel sure that the public ancl the troops could be brought to welcome a service which provides such solid benefits; avoids any limitation in weight or size of packets; compares favourably in speed and ensures greater regularity,especially in winter, than the present service by air.It is significant that the American Forces in the Mediterranean theatre haveno air letter card or light-weight letter service.9. I should, of course, propose to carry all airgraph by air as hitherto.The Air Ministry has always advocated that the public ancl the Forces should be encouraged to make the fullest use of this facility. I should also be willing toarrange a shuttle air service for the carriage of light-weight air letters from north Africa to Sicily and Southern Italy if a fast sea connection on this routeproved difficult to arrange.10.   To sum up :  (a) there are objections on military grounds to an unlimited commitment tocarry from the United Kingdom to North Africa by air, until the endof the war, all light-weight letters offering, whatever the figure towhich the traffic rises; and(b) the right solution is to organise without delay a regular ancl fast mailservice to North Africa by ship, particularly as such a service would offer positive advantages to the public and to the troops which would more than offset any drawbacks arising from surface as opposed to airdelivery.A.
