(43) 425.30th September, 1943.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER REQUIREMENTS  OF  THE  ROYAL  AIR  force for 1944.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1 circulate to the War Cabinet a statement of the Air Ministry&apos;s require-ment for the intake of men and women in 1944, as called for in W.M. (43) 102ndConclusions. It has been assumed by the Air Ministry, in common I understandwith the other two Service Departments and in tbe absence of any otherauthorised hypothesis, that no term can yet be put to the war against Germany.This means that air crews, which require a specially long period of train-ing, have to be provided for in our present calculations to meet war wastageover the whole of the R.A.F. in 1945 and up to mid-1946. This provision couldonly be excluded if a direction were given that the war against Germany wouldhe over at an earlier date; and this would be a grave decision to take, for shouldsuch a direction prove in the event unfounded, there would be no means ofproviding the air crews required. Accordingly, the figures given below havebeen worked out on the assumption of continued war with Germany.2. The allocation of man-power to the Royal Air Force made by the WarCabinet on the 22nd July, 1943 (102nd Conclusions) for the period 1st April to31st December, 1943, was 82,000 less than the number estimated to be necessaryto provide for the planned expansion.3. Nevertheless, in fulfilment of the Prime Ministers recommendation in w.P. (43) 295, that despite the reduced intake of man-power the Royal AirForce should endeavour to fulfil its programme, the following measures havebeen taken to ensure that the loss caused to the fighting strength of the service is reduced to the minimum :  (a) The establishment of the Royal Air Force Regiment, which was cut by20,000 in the early  part of this year, is being reduced by a further5,000-7,000.(b) Balloon defences, which fell from 2,250 to 1,650 balloons as the result of earlier man-power cuts, have been further reduced to 1,450 balloons,with a consequent saving of 2,000 in the establishment of personnel.(c) Establishments in Middle East Command will, it is hoped, be reduced byabout 10,000 to accord with the changed circumstances in this theatre of war.(d) A temporary saving of 8,000 has been obtained by retarding the develop-ment of the Tactical Air Force in the United Kingdom, mainly bydelaying the build-up of ancillary units; the mobility of this force is thus hampered until it can be filled out by the withdrawal of personnel from other Commands.(e) Personnel shortages are being distributed, between all Royal Air ForceCommands in the manner best calculated to accord with strategic requirements.
4. It is not possible as yet to estimate the full effects on operational efficiencywhich these deficiencies entail, but several Commanders-in-Chief, includingCommander-in-Chief. Bomber Command, have already reported that the main-tenance of their squadrons in action against the enemy is being adversely affectedby shortage of men, skilled and unskilled. These difficulties will, indeed, be feltwith increasing severity as more squadrons, many of them on a mobile basis, willbe required for overseas operations and a higher proportion of the Force as awhole will be represented by heavy-bomber squadrons, which are more expensiveto maintain both in aircrews and ground personnel.5. In assessing the man-power requirements of the Royal Air Force for]944. establishment reductions, whether as a result of continuous review in theinterests of economv. or of changes in policy, have of course been allowed forin full.6.   These requirements are as follows :  Men ......      119,000Women      ...       ...        23,000  (includes 250 trained nurses for---R.A.F. Nursing Service)142,000(In addition, civilian requirements amount to 16.000, making a grand totalrequirement of 158,000.)7. These numbers are calculated on the basis of the current expansion programme as adjusted to the latest developments in strategic plans. this programme is related to and in phase with the latest available data of aircraft production and supply, namely :  (a) The production programme accepted by the Defence Committee (Supply)and issued bv the M.A.P. in January 1943 (as revised up to the9th August. 1943).(b) The allocations of American aircraft set out in the Arnold-CourtneyAgreement of the 9th July. 1943. and the provision for subsequentreplacement.8. The major portion of this man-power requirement is in respect of wastage, divided as between ground personnel and crews as follows :  (i) Ground personnel        ...       ...       ...       ...       42,500(ii) Aircrew..................      72,700( (i) is assessed in terms of a percentage, based on experience and reviewedregularly, applied to the strength in ground personnel. It representsthat part of the wastage up to June 1945 for which untrainedreplacements must be entered in 1944.(ii) is assessed in relation to estimated operational effort in 1945 and 1946.It has no relation to the anticipated wastage of crews in 1944 forwhich it was necessary to enter untrained entrants in 1943 and earlier. It represents, therefore, the estimated wastage in the force during the latter part of 1945 and during 1946, to meet which menmust be placed under training in 1944).9. The remainder 26,800 are required to meet deficiencies and providefor the planned expansion, which is now almost wholly in heavy-bomber, transport and special duties squadrons as shown in the following table : Transport and heavy Bomber   Special Duties_ Squadrons.*       Squadrons.December...........- 84 351944-March ............ 9b&apos; 40June ............ 98 43September............ 101 45December............ 119 451945-March ............ 127 45June ......   i.....&apos;J 127 45* Any shortfall of aircraft production will necessarily delay or reduce the projectedexpansion of heavy bomber squadrons. Some of the squadrons shown may have to be diverted to the Airborne forces.
10. It would clearly have been impossible in the normal course to limitrequirements, other than wastage provision, to so low a figure as 26,800. Inaddition, however, to the reductions which are being effected in the R.A.F.Regiment, Balloon Command and Middle East Command, and detailed establish-ment reductions generally, three major factors have contributed to this result: (i) As the peak of the expansion of the R.A.F. is substantially reached inJune 1945, it should be possible in 1944 to contract the ground training organisation to cater for greatly reduced numbers and to cut trainingstaffs, by some 20,000.(ii) The greater facilities now available for overseas trooping and the comparative stabilisation of overseas requirements make it possibleto reduce the non-effective pool in the case of men by 50 per cent., thussaving about 23,000.(iii) Local recruitment in India (25.000) and West Africa (1,000).11. I am continuing to seek further measures of economy; but so long as itis necessary to provide for the continuance of the war against Germany beyondthe end of 1944, I cannot anticipate any material reduction in the man-powerdemand as now presented.A.
