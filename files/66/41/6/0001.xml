THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 406.-20th September. 1943POST-WAR CIVIL AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.WHEN this matter last came before the War Cabinet on 19th August(W.M. (43) 117th Conclusions, Minute 3) my colleagues approved the suggestion,which I made on behalf of the Ministerial Committee on Civil Air Transport, thata telegram should be sent to the Prime Minister enquiring whether there had been any definite result from his talks on civil aviation at the Quebec Conference,and asking him to urge upon the Canadian Government the importance of reaching a decision on the proposals regarding future consultations on thismatter which had been made to them in the letter from the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs to Mr. Massey of 22nd July, 1943 (Annex I).2. The Canadian Governments reply to the letter of 22nd July, 1943, hasnow been received (Annex II). This communicated their agreement to partici-pate in a preliminary Commonwealth meeting in London in the near future on conditions which were acceptable to us. Since then the Prime Minister has tele-graphed the outcome of a conversation with Pi^esiclent Roosevelt on12th September, 1943, at which the President indicated that he would not beupset in any way by a preliminary Empire meeting (Annex III).3. The Ministerial Committee reviewed the situation in the lisht of these developments at their meeting on the 17th September, 1943. In order to ensurethat members of the Commonwealth are prepared for preliminary discussions atthe shortest possible notice, and in view of the anxiety of Ministers to be in aposition to report some progress when Parliament reassembles this week, they decided to despatch a telegram to the Dominion Governments (a similar messagebeing sent to the Viceroy by the Secretary of State for India), the text of whichis given in Annex IV. &quot; This telegram summarised the situation which had beenreached, and invited agreement in principle to the proposal for the assembly inLondon of a meeting to be attended by Commonwealth Government representa-tives (probably High Commissioners with technical advisers) for informal discussion on the basis of the statement of principles which had been telegraphedto the Dominions and India on the 3rd July.4. The War Cabinet will be aware that in order to meet the objections raised by the Canadian Government, who felt that the assembly of BritishCommonwealth representatives in advance of an international conference mightbe misunderstood in the United States, it was stipulated that no announcement should be made of the holding, of the London talks. But, since the President hasnow assured the Prime Minister that no embarrassment would be caused to himby such a meeting, the Committee felt that the Government should be free, ifquestions on this subject are put to them in Parliament, to announce that invita-tions have been issued to an informal and exploratory meeting to be held inLondon in the near future. This has been indicated to the Canadian PrimeMinister in a telegram from the Deputy Prime Minister (Annex V).[26106] copy No.WAR CABINET.
5. The Ministerial Committee also noted that it had been agreed betweenthe Prime Minister and the President that it would be useful that the questionof an International Conference on Civil Aviation should be raised at theforthcoming meeting of Foreign Secretaries at Moscow. The Committee have recommended that at these meetings discussions on this topic should be confined to questions of procedure, e.g., the scope of the conference, the status of delegationsand the date and place of meetings. It should be explained that the purpose ofthe Conference would be to explore the most suitable method of applying theprinciple of international co-operation to the organisation of civil air transportafter the war. His Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted the view that thispurpose would best be served by discussion on the official plane, but for parliamentary reasons they would prefer that the United Kingdom delegation should be led by a junior Minister. As regards the Governments to be invitedto participate in the conference, if there should be any attempt to excluderepresentatives of the Dominions and India it is essential that this should be resisted, having regard to the vital importance of the question to those countries.6. In considering the venue of the Conference the Committee deprecateWashington if only on the ground that delegates would there be exposed to strong pressure from American commercial and political interests. If it is, consideredthat our objection to Washington makes it impossible for us to press for London,and as Ottawa is now excluded, we should prefer a &quot;neutral&quot; meeting-placesuch as Bermuda. Our information from Washington goes to show that the atmosphere in the United States is now favourable for a conference of thiskind but that it probably will not continue to be so much longer. We thereforeurge that arrangements be made to convene the conference at the earliest practicable opportunity and, in any case, not later than the beginning ofNovember.7. The Committee understand that the question of civil aviation has notyet been placed on the Agenda of the Tripartite Meetings by His Majesty&apos;s&quot;Government, but that they propose to raise it under item 3 (d) of the Americanagenda and have so informed the United States Government. Since this subject is of a different character from the other items on the Agenda and. for thereasons already stated, is of a particularly urgent nature, the ministerial committee venture to hope that it may be taken at an early stage.8.   We ask the War Cabinet (a) to take note of the invitations which have been issued for a preliminaryand exploratory meeting of Commonwealth representatives in London ;and(b) to invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to take all possible steps, on the lines indicated above, to ensure the convention of anInternational Conference on Civil Aviation at the earliest possible moment.C.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1.20th September, 1943.
[26106]Copy of a Letter dated 22nd July, 1943, from the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs to the High Commissioner for Canada.*      *      *Thank you for your letter of the 12th July on the subject of post-war civilaviation, which has now been considered by the United Kingdom Government.2. As regards the question of prior Commonwealth consultations, we are, ofcourse, entirely in sympathy with the main object which I understand your government has in view, namely, the need for securing a satisfactory agreementwith the United States Government on this subject. At the same time, we are anxious to ensure that the fullest possible measure of agreement is reached between the members of the British Commonwealth, and we feel that, in view ofthe importance of the issues raised, it may not be possible to secure full agreement by correspondence. While we do not wholly share the view of your Government thatpreliminary discussion between the members of the Commonwealth should lead to difficulties with the United States Government, we are anxious to find somesolution of this problem which should not be open to the difficulties which your government see in the matter. We therefore suggest that, when the replies of thevarious Governments to our telegrams of the 3rd July, setting out our generalprovisional views on the question are received, there should then be a meeting between members of the Government here and yourself and the other DominionHigh Commissioners in London, attended, if practicable, by any necessary expertswho may be coming from the Dominions to attend the proposed internationalmeeting. This meeting, which need not be publicised in any way, should, wesuggest, take place about a fortnight in front of the date of the internationalgathering which we hope that the Canadian Government would call to meet inCanada.3. As regards the question of representation at the proposed internationalgathering, we agree that the work of such a conference must inevitably be of a consultative and exploratory character. The United States and Soviet representa-tives at such a meeting are unlikely to be Ministers of Cabinet rank and, moreover,it is clear that full decisions could not be taken by such a conference, but wouldhave to be left to a subsequent conference representative of all the United Nations,or, at any rate, those mainly interested in civil aviation.4. At the same time, for parliamentary reasons here, we feel that it wouldbe inadvisable that the United Kingdom representation at such a conference should consist solely of officials, and we think that the most useful precedent wouldbe that of the delegation sent to the recent Food Conference at Hot Springs, atwhich, it will be recalled, a delegation of officials was headed by a parliamentary under-Secretary.5. I should be glad to learn whether the above suggestions would be accept-able to the Canadian Government. If so, we suggest that the next step wouldbethat the Canadian Government should issue the necessary invitations to theUnited States and Soviet Governments and to the other members of the BritishCommonwealth to attend a consultative and exploratory conference in canada and that we should at the same time issue an invitation to the members of theCommonwealth to agree that, when their replies to our telegram of the 3rd Julyhave been received, these should be discussed at a meeting in London&apos; between united Kingdom Ministers ancl the respective High Commissioners, attended by such experts as can be made available in order to clear up any outstanding points.6. I should be glad to learn as soon as possible the views of your Governmenton the above suggestions.*      *      *
ANNEX III.Copy of an Extract of a Telegram, dated 14th September, 1943, from the PrimeMinister to the Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the L,ord Privy Seal.Mackenzie King told me that he did not mind a preliminary commonwealth meeting in London, or in Canada, provided the Americans did not feelwe were &quot;ganging up against them&quot; like at the Ottawa Conference. I told the President yesterday that this was a family affair but that of course we didnot want to upset them in any way. He made no objection except that he hopedit would not be &quot; like Ottawa.&quot; I explained that all we wanted was an informalpreliminary exchange of views within the British Commonwealth and that ifCanada would not come she could stay away, but that I knew she would come ifassured that no American offence would be taken. His attitude implied that itwas entirely our affair.2. I am accordingly telling Mackenzie King that in the atmosphere of ourpresent frank and trustful relations the President would not be upset by thepreliminary Empire meeting in any way.3. The President is, of course, favourable to the proposed international conference of the &quot; Big Three&quot; plus China and possibly others of the united nations. But he considers that we should open this to Russia first and that noplans should be made until the forthcomirrg tripartite Anglo-Soviet-Americanmeetings.....   It might be quite a good thing to raise it at the foreign ministers&apos; Conference. The President did not seem to think there was anyextreme hurry.Copy of a Letter, dated Oth September, 1943. from the Canadian HighCommissioner to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.*       *       * -I would refer to your letter of the 22nd July regarding air transport policyand the proposed prior Commonwealth consultations.2. I learn from my Government that, following discussions withMr. Churchill, he was informed at a meeting of the Canadian War Cabinet onthe 31st August that the Canadian Government would, participate in a pre-liminarv Commonwealth meetiim- in London in the near future, on theunderstanding that the meeting was informal and exploratory and involved nocommitments, and that the nature of the meeting be fully understood by the UnitedStates Government.3. As to the place of any subsequent international gathering. Mr. Churchillwas informed that, when Canada had suggested a meeting in Ottawa, it had been contemplated that the discussions would be confined to representatives of Common-wealth countries and the United States. Subsequently, the United Kingdomproposed the inclusion of Soviet, and possibly Chinese, representatives though not of other Fjnited Nations. This proposal altered the situation, and in the lightof developments the Canadian Government was not prepared at this time toundertake the sponsoring of an International Conference.4. I am informed that Mr. Churchill will raise the matter in his discussions with Mr. Roosevelt this week. In the meantime, my Government are preparing a statement of their views on the nature of the Commonwealth and international discussions, which I shall transmit to you in due course.5. I should be srrateful if vou would inform me, in the meantime, whether any replies have yet been received from the Australian, New Zealand and SouthAfrican Governments to the circular telegram of the 3rd July, setting forth a provisional statement of the United Kingdom Governments views on air transport policy.*      *      *
4.   The President expressed the following preliminary views : (i) There should be private ownership.(ii) Key points should be available for international use on reciprocal basis.(iii) Internal traffic should be reserved to internal companies.(iv) Government support may be required on an international basis forcertain non-paying routes.5.   I did not attempt to discuss merits or details.ANNEX IV.Copy of a Telegram dated 17th September, 1943, from the Dominions Office tothe Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South A frica.(A Telegram in similar terms is being despatched by the Secretary of State forIndia to the Viceroy of India.)My telegram of the 3rd July.   (Post-War Civil Aviation.)2. We have now received comments on the provisional statement of principles set out in that telegram from all Governments except commonwealth government, and we feel that, subject, of course to Commonwealth governments views, the measure of agreement already expressed justifies us in proposing oralexchange of views with that.statement as basis for discussion.3. Prime Minister took opportunity of recent visit to Quebec to discussmatter with Prime Minister of Canada and subsequently mentioned to president roosevelt that it was in contemplation to have air informal preliminary exchangeof views between the members of the British Commonwealth on this subject. ThePresident entirely understood the position and made it clear that no embarrass-ment would be caused to him bv such a meeting. The Prime Minister also discussed the question of a future international conference on this matter, andit was agreed that it would be useful that the matter should be raised at theforthcoming tripartite Anglo-Soviet-United States meetings (see my telegramD. No. 655 of the 14th September). Idea would be to confine discussions at the tripartite meetings to questions of procedure. e.g.. the scope of the conference,the status of delegations, and the date ancl place of meeting.4. In the meantime, we attach the greatest importance to an informal discus-sion between British Commonwealth representatives, and we are anxious toproceed with arrangements for this forthwith. We suggest that it could most conveniently take place in London, and we should be glad to learn whether you agree. It would be entirely agreeable to us if you should decide to be represented by your High Commissioner in London, but we assume that you would sendtechnical advisers to London to assist in the discussions. We should like the meetings to take place as early as possible in October, but if this would be imprac-ticable for the technical advisers perhaps you would let us know when it wouldbe possible for them to arrive.5. There is strong pressure here (ancl no doubt also in the Dominions) bothin Parliament and. outside for early progress to be made in discussion of this veryessential post-war issue, and we are anxious therefore to make as rapid progressas possible towards arranging for full discussions on the subject between allinterested parties. We should therefore be grateful for a very early reply,particularly in view of the meeting of Parliament.here next week.
Copy of a Telegram dated 17th September, 1943, from the Dominions Office tothe Government of Canada.Following from Deputy Prime Minister for Prime Minister of Canada(Post-War Civil Aviation) :-Prime Minister has informed us of his discussions with you and with president Roosevelt on this subject. T am repeating to you accordingly my telegram* to other Dominion Governments so that you may know how the matternow stands. We shall be glad to hear from you as soon as possible whom you would wish to represent you. and we will keep you informed of replies receivedfrom other Governments. If questions are put to us on this subject in Parliamentnext week, we propose to say that invitations have been issued to an informaland exploratory meeting to be held in London in the near future.* Annex IV.
