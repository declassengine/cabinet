Two Armoured Divisions.     Five Armoured Divisions.2. All the armoured divisions will be located in Southern Command within theareas shown on the attached map. Considerations of quartering [i.e., the existence of accommodation, tank standings, etc.) make it impossible to vary these locations.3. All the U.S. armoured formations will have had a considerable amount ofinitial training in America before their arrival in this country, and generally speakingthe first arrivals here will be the most highly trained.It is essential that the formations on their arrival shall have adequate training facilities, as otherwise the troops will rapidly become &quot; stale &quot;, the value of the trainingwhich they have received will be lost and their efficiency as fighting units will quicklydeteriorate.Further, it follows from the fact that they will be in a fairly advanced state of initial training when they arrive that their adequate further training must entail a continuousprogramme of regimental and divisional schemes, which automatically involves theuse of considerable areas of land.4. The existing areas available for armoured training in Southern Command are shown coloured red on the map. It will be seen that these are few and most restricted.Further, there are no existing nearby armoured training areas in the adjoining Commands(Western and South Eastern) except the South Downs which is in full use by British and canadian armour.5. Faced with this situation, a complete reconnaissance of Southern Command hasbeen undertaken. Experience has shown that no area which does not (a) give a firmsubsoil and (b) provide the natural features which are essential to give realistic training is of any practical use for the purpose.6. These considerations eliminate the moorland areas in Cornwall and Devon aswell as the New Forest, and it may be said that the whole of the land in the remainder of the Command has been brought to a fairly high degree of agricultural productivity.. . 7-,In these circumstances a considerable measure of prejudice to food production is inevitable, but with a view to minimizing this as far as possible an attempt has beenmade to utilize such armoured training areas as exist and link these up with SalisburyPlain, part of the latter being handed over to US. interests and the remainder being used as far as possible having regard to its essential use for range practice by the RoyalArtillery.8. With these considerations in view the US. authorities originally proposed thatin addition to the Plain the areas shown edged in blue on the attached map should bemade available for U.S. armoured training.
g. The U.S. General Staff are, however, most conscious of the importance oiagriculture, and General Devers has himself considered the whole matter. As a resulthe has offered to reduce the original areas by some 25 per cent, (hachured blue on the map) thus arriving at the present request for about 141,000 acres. This acreage excludesSalisbury Plain itself and the areas marked red on the map which are alreadyrequisitioned.10. From a military point of view, having regard to the concentration of armour tobe trained and to be kept up to a high pitch of training, the American request is reason-able and to refuse it will be to refuse facilities which on military grounds wc should regard as essential for our own forces.11. It is proposed to apply Defence Regulation 52 to the whole of the areas except(i) to the Plain itself which is already War Department property, (ii) to an area of about16,500 acres already requisitioned under Defence Regulation 51 and (iii) to further areasaggregating some 6,000 acres which are likely to be most intensively used. The effects of the application of the two Defence Regulations mentioned are set out in Appendix A.12. Under the arrangements proposed, although prejudice to food production mustbe considerable, it is thought that the area as a whole will by no means be totally lost to agriculture. Experience has already been gained on this point in connection with theWolds, which is held under Defence Regulation 52 where it is anticipated that 60 percent, of the harvest is likely to be gathered despite intensive armoured use since june last.13. The U.S. proposal does not contemplate the firing of live ammunition and there-fore the question of evacuation of population will not arise.14. It should be pointed out that although this paper is concerned primarily withconflicts of interest as regards agriculture, there will also undoubtedly be conflicts withthe Services and other Ministries who have interests in the areas required by the americans. Until consideration has been given to the policy to be adopted no detailedaction to ascertain specific conflicts has been taken. If, however, approval in principle is given it is thought that any clash of interests should be capable of solution by adjust-ment of details through normal channels.^ 15. The foregoing deals exclusively with armoured training requirements for theUS. Forces in Southern Command, but it should be made clear that in addition to thefive armoured divisions which have to be catered for there will be other American troopscomposed partly of infantry divisions and partly of Air Force personnel. As regardsthe last named, no special training facilities will be required, but land will of course be needed for training of infantry divisions.In part, facilities for this infantry training will be found to exist in the areas atpresent available for British training of similar character but it must be recognized that additional demands for infantry training areas will almost certainly be made when thegreater number of American troops arrive.Typical of such requests is one which has recently been made on behalf of U.S.airborne forces for the ground training of their personnel (these areas are edged yellowon the map). Requests of this and similar kinds are not likely to be productive of seriousconflicts with other interests and therefore should be capable of being dealt with throughnormal Departmental channels.16. I fully realize the difficulties which the American request involves, but if the americans are to be in a position to carry out their part in the approved strategy, I see no alternative but to submit the request for the approval of the War CabinetThe War Office,t\th October, 1943.APPENDIX AThe use of land for military training is obtained either by the application of defence regulation 51 or Defence Regulation 52.D.R. 51 is the Regulation by which requisition is effected giving the right to soleuse and possession and involves dispossession of the occupier. Compensation underthe terms of the Compensation (Defence) Act is payable for the land or buildingsrequisitioned.D.R. 52 gives the right to the competent authority to use land for military purposeswithout dispossessing the occupier. No payment by way of rent is made, but com-pensation is payable for damage caused by training.(B43/181)   90   10/43   W.O.P.   15201
