ANNEX C.(i) Letter from Soviet Charge d&apos; Affaires to Foreign Secretary,2%th September, 1943.My dear Foreign Secretary,Referring to the letter of the British Ambassador in Moscow, Sir ArchibaldClark Rerr, of the 19th September to the People&apos;s Commissar for ForeignAffairs, M. Molotov, containing a list of questions for discussion at the meetingof the representatives of the Governments of Great Britain, the United Statesand the U.S.S.R., I have the honour to state that the Government of the U.S.S.E.has instructed me to inform the Government of Great Britain as follows :&apos;- The Soviet Government has acquainted itself with the list of questionsproposed by the British Government for discussion at the meeting to be held in moscow of the representatives of the Governments of Great Britain, the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union.When expressing its acceptance of the arrangements for the meeting theSoviet Government mentioned that to achieve success at this meeting it would bedesirable to receive from the Governments of Great Britain and the United Statesboth the list of questions suggested for consideration at the meeting and also their proposals on these matters. The suggestion of the Soviet Government met with no objection, but up till the present time the Soviet Government has received onlythe list of questions and has not received any proposals from the BritishGovernment.American Agenda.1. General Security (Four-Nation Declaration) as a basis for maintenanceof peace and security in the world after the end of hostilities, it is suggested thatthe United States. Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China enter into a four-nation arrangement which would provide for consultation and co-operation incarrying out the desires of those four nations for the maintenance of peace by continuing after the war the present collaboration in the prosecution of the war.A tentative draft of such declaration is attached hereto.2. (a) Treatment of Germany and other enemy countries in European blocduring the armistice period, international militarisation, political, and economiccontrol over Germany.(b) Steps towards ultimate settlement : length of the armistice period, future status of the German Government, frontiers, and other questions.3.    Economic matters for reconstruction :  (a) Question of reparations.(b) Co-operation in the rehabilitation of war damage in the U.S.S.R.(c) Joint action for assistance to other countries.id) Collaboration on an international basis dealing with matters such asfood and agriculture, transport and communications, finance andtrade, and I.L.O.(e) Any specific matter either of the other Governments wishes to raise.4. Methods of dealing with current political and economic issues and thosewhich may arise as the war progresses.Our proposal is that matters on which it is found desirable for the three governments to consult should be dealt with in Moscowr. London or Washingtonas may be most appropriate on an ad hoc basis by permanent diplomatic repre-sentatives in each capital. Experts could be sent if desired to participatedepending upon the character of the subjects under discussion. This is not intended to preclude the holding of international or tripartite conferences -as theoccasion may make desirableWe will be prepared to discuss at the October Moscow conference any currentissues proposed by either of the other two Governments on which it may be foundtimely to consult.
On their part, the Soviet Government proposes the following : 1. To consider the measures for shortening the time of the war againstGermany and her allies in Europe.It is viewed that such urgent measures on the part of the Governments ofGreat Britain ancl the United States to be taken in 1943 which will secure the invasion by the Anglo-American armies of Western Europe across the english channel, and which, together&apos; with the powerful blows of the Soviet troops againstthe main forces of the German army on the Soviet-German front, must entirelyexplode the military strategic situation in Germany and must lead to a decisiveshortening of the war.2. Concerning other questions for discussion at the meeting in Moscow, theSoviet Government has no objection to the discussion at the meeting of this orother questions mentioned in the agenda proposed by the British Government.The Soviet Government, however, considers it desirable that the British Govern-ment should communicate in advance its proposals on the questions put by themfor an agreement to be reached among all three Governments.3. The Soviet Government is of the opinion that the meeting of the repre-sentatives of the three Governments must be only of a preparatory character andmust work out the proposals for the consideration of the Governments of GreatBritain, the United States and the Soviet Union.Yours sincerely.A. SOBOLEV.Charge d&apos;&apos;&apos;Affaires ad interim.(ii) Letter from Foreign Secretary to Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires.My dear Charge d&apos;Affaires, 1st October, 1943.I thank you for your letter of 29th September concerning the agenda for theForeign Ministers&apos; Conference.With regard to Item 1 of your letter I would refer you to the message sent by the Prime Minister to Marshal Stalin on 5th September in which he stated &quot; 3. The political representatives might require to be assisted by military advisers. I would provide a general officer, Sir Hastings Ismay, who is mypersonal representative on the Chiefs of Staff Committee and conducts the secretariat of the Ministry of Defence. He could supply the arguments andfacts and figures on the military questions involved. I believe the UnitedStates would send an officer similarly qualified. This I think would besufficient at this stage for the meeting of Foreign Ministers.4. If however you wish to go in technical detail into the question ofwhy we have not yet invaded France across the Channel and why we cannot do it sooner or in greater strength than is now proposed, I should welcome aseparate technical mission of your Generals and Admirals coming to london or Washington, or both, when the fullest possible exposition of our thought,resources and intentions could be laid before them and thrashed out.Indeed, I should be very glad that you should have this explanation, to which you have every right.&quot;This represents the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this questionso far as the present Conference is concerned. In the absence of any commentwe had proceeded on the assumption that this basis was accepted. However, theoffer made in the last part of the Prime Minister&apos;s message is still open.In the meanwhile, as you are no doubt aware, a communication was made tothe Soviet Government after the Quebec Conference on the part of our twoGovernments and their Combined Chiefs of Staff.With reference to Item 2 of your letter, I enclose a copy of the agenda pro-posed by His Majesty&apos;s Government (Annex A). Proposals have already beensent to the Soviet Government under Items 5 and 6 (a) and part of 6 (b) of thisagenda. I enclose herewith particulars of these proposals. With regard to other items of the agenda, proposals will shortly be submitted to the Soviet Government,of which I shall send you details, but there are some Items, for instance, numbers 1,4, 13 and parts of 6 \b) and 11, with regard to which we think it would be more
appropriate to have an exchange of views before any proposals are put forward.We will, however, try to let the Soviet Government have an indication on these points of the matters which, in our opinion, merit discussion between the three governments.Yours sincerely.ANTHONY EDEN.Enclosure.Particulars of Proposals already sent to Soviet and United Stales Governments.Under Item 5.The text was contained in a Note to the Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires dated the28th September.Under Item 6 (a).The text was contained in an aide-memoire dated the 1st July, on &quot; SuggestedPrinciples which would govern the conclusion of hostilities with the european members of the Axis,&quot; which was handed to M. Maisky by Mr. Eden.Under Item 6 (b).His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow has been instructed to make a communication to M. Molotov on the subject of the future of Austria, the precisetext of which has not yet been received from Sir A. Clark Kerr.
