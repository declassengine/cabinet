It is issuedfor the personal use of j-&quot;2-^MOST SECRET.fW.P. (43) 409.21st September, 1943.WAR CABINET.IRELAND.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I am in general agreement with the views expressed by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs in his Memorandum of the 16th September, and would onlyadd the following comment as to the effect on Northern Ireland of the proposedAmerican approach to Mr. de Vaiera.I am disposed to agree that &apos;&apos; Mr. de Valera will not undertake at thisstage to bring Southern Ireland into the war on the Allied side or to give openand un-neutral facilities to the Allied Forces.&quot; As a result, however, of thereply which Mr. de Valera will send to the President of the United States, thesuggestion will be made by various people both in this country and in the UnitedStates that if partition were ended, Eire would abandon or modify its policy ofneutrality. Possibly Mr. de Valera&apos;s reply to the President would be so framedas not to discourage such a suggestion.We should then be asked to urge upon Northern Ireland that the time hadcome to reconsider their severance from Eire, and we should be in the worstpossible position for doing so. To the loyalists of Northern Ireland thesuggestion would appear to be one for selling Ulster for the purpose of purchasingsome doubtful and temporary help from Eire at a stage of the war when it cannotbe contended that the absence of such help imperils the chance of victory. TheUlsterman would feel that the rights which he regards as most precious werebeing bartered away at the &quot;suggestion of the United States for a transient andnon-essential advantage.. H. M.Home Office, 21st September, 1943.Copy No.[26110]
