THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET.INTERNAL TRANSPORTATION IN INDIA.Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.THE War Cabinet, at its meeting on the 30th August (W.M. (43) 120thConclusions), accepted a recommendation made by the Shipping Committeethat a reliable estimation of the internal transportation position in India and ofthe effect of increased military activity on the availability of Indian exports atseabord should be made as a matter of urgency. They also decided that UnitedStates experts should be associated with this enquiry.2. After consultation with the Minister of War Transport I suggested to the Viceroy that in.order to implement these conclusions :  (a) The Government of India should invite two outstanding experts on the operational side of railway work, one from the United Kingdom andone from the United States, to go to India for a short period withbroad, and elastic terms of reference designed to enable them to put their advice and guidance at the service of the Indian railways. we suggested that they should not form a Committee in the usual sense,by taking evidence and embodying their recommendations in a formalreport, and certainly not that the Indian Railway administration would be in the position of defendants, but on the contrary that thetwo experts would be in India as invited visitors to help and adviseby contributions from their own knowledge and experience. Most oftheir work would be done by making suggestions on the spot to those concerned, any recommendations of a more general nature being madeto the Indian Railway Board. In putting forward this proposal theMinister of War Transport and I contemplated that besides improvingdirectly transportation in India, it might also improve the prospects of external help by satisfying the Americans that everything is being done to avoid shortcomings in this connection hindering our war effort.(b) A Committee should be set up with the terms of reference suggested bythe Shipping Committee, composed of Sir T. Elderton as Chairmantogether with a representative of the Government of India, a soldierselected by the Commander-in-Chief in India, Mr. Moseley (theMinistry of Supply&apos;s Raw Materials representative in India) andSir J. Nicholson (the Ministry of War Transports representative atDelhi) as members. The Committee would be appointed by theViceroy and report to him, but its report would be made at onceavailable in London. The United States authorities would be invitedto nominate a representative to be associated with the work of theCommittee, preferably Mr. Swerling, who is in charge of the procure-ment for the United States of Indian exports.3. The Viceroy has replied welcoming the proposal described in para-graph 2 (a) above for the despatch of two railway experts to India. He suggeststhat one expert should be qualified in traffic operation and the other in &quot; opera-tions and maintenance.&quot; He adds that the presence in India of a level-headedAmerican railway man of undoubted standing, working on inside information withthe Indian Railway Board, would have a steadying effect on the Americans in[26101]SECRET.W.P. (43) 405.20th September, 1943.
India who have been inclined to be critical and to make suggestions of a some-what impracticable nature. At present a Divisional Superintendent of theUnion Pacific Railway is available part time to the Indian Railway Board,but he is also advising General Wheeler on transport matters and General Wheelerhas not responded to the suggestion that further American transport officers should be associated with this work. The Viceroy reports that it would be helpful to have an American expert who would work solely with the Indian RailwayBoard. He is emphatic regarding the undesirability of treating the IndianRailway Administration as defendants in this matter, as this would seriouslydivert their attentions which are already heavily engaged in working out andimplementing movement plans and the operation of the railways in difficult conditions. They require not criticism but help and encouragement. I have asked the Minister of War &apos;1 transport to recommend two experts of the sortrequired, and in this connection have drawn his attention to CCS. 340 of the9th September and the importance that the American representative should bea. man whose recommendations will carry weight with the United States war department. .4. As regards the proposed Committee described in paragraph 2 (b) above to report on the availability of Indian exports for shipment, the Viceroy says that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to release Sir T. Elderton from his present key position controlling traffic in North-East India. Nor could the Com-mander-in-Chief, India, spare Sir J. Nicholson from his present work connectedwith military operations, and the Viceroy does not consider that either Mr.Moseleyor Mr. Swerling has sufficiently wide experience for such a Committee.In any case the Viceroy considers that adequate administrative machinery already exists inside the Government of India for assessing transport capacity andallotting priorities. Subject to full information being available regarding import and export requirements (see paragraph 5 below), the Government of India could have an estimation of future civil traffic prepared under the aegis of theirCentral Priorities Committee (which includes representatives of the Ministry ofWar Transport and the War Shipping Administration). Indeed the Govern-ment of India provided an appreciation a month ago of the effect of militarytraffic requirements as they then stood on the quantities of raw jute and tea whichcould be brought to Calcutta for export and they are now examining the revisedmilitary traffic requirements in order to ascertain their effect on civil internal,export, and import traffic. In these circumstances the Viceroy suggests that instead of setting up an ad hoc Committee of the type suggested in paragraph2 (b) above, the existing machinery, suitably adapted, should be used. This hasthe advantage that it would enable a series of reports to be submitted to london as circumstances change. For this purpose the Viceroy would propose to set upa special sub-Committee of the Central Priorities Committee referred to above and include in it one or more American representatives, in- which connection he suggests that Mr. Clayton Lane, of the Office of the United States commissioner at New Delhi, or Mr. Fischer, the Delhi representative of the Office of economic warfare, would be a better representative that Mr. Swerling.5. It would be necessary for full information regarding export requirements from India to be at the disposal of the sub-Committee. So far as exports to theUnited States are concerned, this will be provided through the American repre-sentation on the sub-Committee, and it might be left to the Viceroy to arrangedirect with the American authorities in India what form this representations should take. As regards exports to the United Kingdom, there is much to be said for the despatch to India of someone who is fully cognisant of both our rawmaterials ancl our food requirements, ancl whose experience and status wouldenable him to hold his own on the sub-Committee. Alternatively Mr. Moseleymight be added to the sub-Committee, and used as a channel through which the raw materials requirements of the United Kingdom could be transmitted to thesub-Committee, the requirements of the Ministry of Food being telegraphedthrough the India Office to the Government of India as at present. It will befor the Viceroy and the sub-Committee themselves to evolve a means of securingthe interests of territories other than the United Kingdom ancl the United states for which Indian exports are required.6. I would suggest that the sub-Committee, besides submitting an ad hocreport of the type which the Shipping Committee had in view, estimating India&apos;capacity to bring exports to seaboard over a period of say six months ahead,should also be called upon to submit subsequently as a standing arrangement a
further report each month recording any changes in the situation, so that weshould always have bSfore us an estimate of the possibilities for six months ahead.7.   I would ask the War Cabinet:  (a) To take note that the Viceroy has welcomed the proposal that tworailway experts should go to India, who would put their experience and advice at the disposal of the Indian authorities, and of whom, one would be an American expert, and authorise me in consultation withthe Minister for War Transport to take urgent steps to give effectto it.(&amp;) To approve the Viceroy&apos;s suggestion described in paragraph 4 above, forthe preparation by a sub-Committee of the Government of India&apos;sCentral Priorities Committee of an estimation of the quantity ofIndian exports Which can be brought to seaboard, subject to detailed consideration in consultation with the Viceroy of the points mentioned in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.L. S. A.India Office, 20th September, 1943.
