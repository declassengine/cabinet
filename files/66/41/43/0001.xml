HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET. Copy NoiW.P. 03) 443.Qth October, 1943. jWAR CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR FORT-NIGHT ENDING 1200 HOURS, SUNDAY, 26th SEPTEMBER, 1943.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.A highly successful attack was made on the Dunlop Tyre Factory atMontlucon; Hanover and Mannheim were raided in force; the railways linkingItaly with France were attacked both at Modane and near St. Raphael.Summary of Operations. aircraft target Date&apos; Despatched.A, 15/16 September 369Montlucon ...       ...... / 340Modane      ... -&quot; 12Antheor-viaduct ...      ... 22/23 711Hanover     ... 99/93 29Oldenburg......... &apos; &quot;              622Mannheim  ...       -       ......      00&apos;/94. 29Darmstadt ... 16&apos;^In addition, 87 aircraft were despatched on small harassing raids on berlin and other German towns and 459 mines were laid.Operations.Montlucon (15th/16th September).This attack was carried out by a force consisting almost entirely of Halifaxesand Stirlings, which dropped 1,000 tons of bombs in half an hour. Day photo-graphs showed that 12 out of 26 large buildings in the factory had been destroyed,including a store for finished products, a test house, a garage and a raw rubberstore. Ten other buildings, including a store for compounding ingredients, a building for the production of solid tyres and a technical office and laboratorywere also seen to be very badly damaged. Five storage sheds near the factoryhave also been destroyed.Print No. 1 shows damage at the factory.Modane (16th/17th September).10/10ths cloud and icing were experienced on both the outward and returnjourneys by the attacking force which again consisted almost entirely of Stirlingsand Halifaxes. Conditions over the target were good, and day photographs showa great concentration of craters running from the east end of the InternationalStation at Modane, and completely filling the loop formed by the railway doubling-back to the entrance of the Mont Cenis tunnel, through which the main line from paris to Turin and Genoa passes. About 6 hits can be seen on the railway embank-ment partly cutting the tracks in places, and debris is visible on the tracks fromhits on the sides of cuttings through which the loop runs. Many houses aredamaged-or destroyed and a large industrial plant has been damaged.Antheor Viaduct (St. Raphael) (16th/17th September).A small force of Lancasters was despatched to attack this viaduct whichcarries the alternative main line from France to N. Italy. It is an exceptionallydifficult type of target to attack successfully from the air, and the bombing,although much of it was close to the viaduct, failed to destroy it.[26205] B
Hanover (22nd/23rd September).Night plots confirmed by day photographs show that most of the bombs inthis attack fell in the southern suburbs of Hanover and in open country. Anumber of outlying factories were hit and considerable housing damage was caused.   Among the industrial undertakings which suffered are :  Wollwascherei (Dohren) (The second largest wool combers in Germany).Eisenwerke (Wiilfel) (Steel works).Garvens Waagen-(Rolling stock).Mannheim (23rd/24th September).This renewed attack on Mannheim after the highly successful raid of the5th/6th September was carried out under good conditions and preliminary reports were promising. It appeared that a good concentration had been achieved on theindustrial and docks area, and this was confirmed by night plots which indicated,however, that some bombing had fallen in the N.W. suburbs and. in the neigh-bouring village of Frankendorf. Day phonographs, which have not yet been completely examined, show that very serious industrial damage has been done;detailed interpretation is hampered by smoke from fires which were still burningthroughout the Eastern section of the city.In the NAY. considerable new damage has been done to the EG. Farbenworks at Ludwigshafen. The Dyestulfs and Heavy Chemicals Section has been hit and several buildings in the Sulphuric Acid and Plastics Sections have beenburnt out. Two labour camps have been largely gutted, and substantial damage has been caused to housing in the N.W. suburban area.Destruction in the main dock area at the junction of the Rhine and Neckaris very severe and extensive, and housing damage, especially in Neckarstadt is great.   The following items of industrial damage are already indentified :-Zellstoff Fabrik Waldhof A.G. : Cellulose Mill.Mannheim Motorenwerke : Submarine Diesel Engines.Verein Deutsche Oelfabriken : Edible Oils and Fats.Raschig G.m.b.H. : Chemicals.Brown Boveri : Electrical Motors.akali-Chemie A.G. : Explosives.Fires were still burning in several of these undertakings on the afternoonafter the attack. Damage to public utilities added, to that caused by the lastattack is considerable.Prints Nos. 2, 3 and 4 show some of the damage caused.Oldenburg (22nd/23rd September) and Darmstadt (23rd/24th September).Photographs show that the small forces sent to these towns located and bombed them successfully.Results of Previous Raids.Berlin.A further interpretation of photographs taken after the attacks on Berlinshows that, in addition to those previously reported, about 87 more industrial concerns have been hit.   Of these, the following have been seriously damaged : Underground Railway Repair Shops :   Charlottenburg-Ruhleben.Deutscher Eisenhandel (Steel Storage) : Schoneberg.Berliner Elek. Ges., Speck U. Co. : Charlottenburg.Warehouses (Grain, Oil, Coal) : Plotzensee.Damage to railway property includes buildings at Moabit goods station,Anhalter storage sidings, Charlottenburg goods station, Wilmersdorg goods station and locomotive workshops at Tempelhof and Charlottenburg.Many military and labour camps have also been damaged, including a militaryM.T. depot at Charlottenburg.85 acres of business and residential property have been heavily damaged by fire in Steglitz, and similar damage has been done to smaller areas inSchoneberg and Friedenau. In all, between 250 and 280 acres have been destroyed or seriously damaged in various parts of the city.
Hamburg.A final interpretation of photographs confirms that damage and destructionis on a scale far beyond anything before achieved in aerial attack. Thousands ofacres, especially, in the East, can be seen in which every building in every streethas been demolished or left roofless and gutted. Some impression of the totaleffect upon this, the second largest city in Germany, can be gauged from thefollowing facts : (i) Over 77 per cent, of the fully built-up area has been destroyed or damaged.(ii) All the four main shipbuilcling yards and the M.A.N. diesel engine works have been damaged.(iii) In the dock area five floating clocks have been sunk or damaged, togetherwith numerous ships in the harbour, of which 12 are over 200 feet.Every warehouse in the Baaken harbour on one quay for a distance ofabout a mile is burnt out and on another quay for two-thirds of a mile.(iv) In the town 150 industrial plants have been destroyed or damaged.(v) The two important power stations at Neuhof and Tiefstack appear tohave been inactive since the attacks. Two other power stations in thetown were seriously damaged, and two very large gas holders at themain gas works in Grasbrook are burnt out.Munich.Day photographs show fresh damage in the districts running S. and W. ofthe Sudbahnhof. The large Market Hall near the station has been severely damaged (see Print No. 5) and the town power station alongside the river has alsobeen hit.Brauweiler Transformer and Switching Station.Day photographs show that small &quot;blind&quot; attacks by Mosquitoes whichhave recently been made on this important isolated installation have scored hitsand caused damage; the precise extent of this cannot be accurately assessed.General.Measures recently taken by the enemy both on the fighting fronts ancl withinGermany show the grave threat which the Anglo-American bomber offensiveconstitutes in German eyes.   At the beginning of September 1943 the disposition of German fighters was as follows :S.E. T.E.Fighters. Fighters.Western Front        .........       1,000 550Mediterranean        ...       ...       ... 320 10Russia ....      ......... 440 100Fighter support on the fronts in the East and South is thus reduced to apoint at which it is very small in comparison with the Allied air forces of Russia,North Africa and the Middle East. Furthermore, German flak defences on theWestern front absorb man-power estimated at 900,000 leaving only 350,000 forall other theatres, 77 per cent, of the total number of heavy and 55 per cent, ofthe total of automatic anti-aircraft weapons.Mining.The following mining successes are reported : 21st July. German trawler Hornsress was mined off Jutland.Mid-July. Swedish Korsoe (2,726 tons) was damaged by a mine offthe Dutch coast.15th September. Swedish Valen (966 tons) was damaged by a mineoff Moen.A.
