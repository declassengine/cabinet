this document IS the PROPERTY of h?s britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 424.30th September, 1943GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I have been considering the Foreign secretary&apos;s paper about Germany, W.P.(43) 421, and I feel bound to warn the War Cabinet that I foresee difficultiesahead in our relations with the Dominion Governments unless we are able to takeearly action to forestall them.We are now approaching the time when vital decisions will have to be taken as regards the post-war settlement, and in particular the reconstruction of Europe.The Foreign Secretary in his forthcoming talks at Moscow will find itdifficult to avoid expressing views on behalf of the United Kingdom Governmentun these matters, though he may wish to reserve the major issues for the subse-quent meeting between the Heads of Governments. In any case, at that later meeting, it is certain that definite decisions will be taken and commitments made,which may well be the corner-stone of post-war policy.Where is our opportunity for adequate prior consultation with DominionGovernments and for reaching a joint Commonwealth and Empire policy?The Foreign Secretary&apos;^ paper W.P. (43) 421 affords a clear example. this raises the whole issue of the future settlement of Europe. On the success of that settlement the question of peace or war for the future depends. We have recently(July last on the basis of the Foreign Secretary:s paper W.P. (43) 218) taken up with the Dominions our suggestions for the future of Austria. The repliesfrom Australia and South Africa have expressed doubts as to our proposed policy, mainly on the ground that it was an attempt to settle in advance one particular aspect of a major ancl more general problem the future of Germany.Ancl they emphasised that this was a matter on which the Dominions must be consulted before we committed ourselves to other Governments.Another example is given by the proposals which President Roosevelt madeto the Prime Minister at their recent meeting about the setting up of some kindof world organisation for the discussion and settlement of world problems.These are matters on which I am sure it will be agreed that there must be ajoint Commonwealth and Empire policy.But they cannot be dealt with adequately by telegrams, ancl certainly not inthe time before the Foreign Secretary must be ready to discuss them at Moscow.Indeed, to telegraph to the Dominions the substance of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper on Germany, asking for their comments in a matter of days, would onlyarouse resentment. But unless we take some action to provide an opportunityfor adequate consultation on these vital issues, we shall either have disagreementor the Dominions will have to accept a fait accompli. In either case, the effecton our mutual relations may well be deplorable.These considerations, the importance of which for the Empire I need notstress, seem to me to make it imperative, if it is in any way possible, that the dateot the projected talks with the Dominion Prime Ministers should be advanced.I fully realise the difficulties which led the Cabinet to decide to postpone them until next January. But by then many of these great issues may have had tobe decided. Would it not be possible for them to be held at the beginning ofNovember, i.e., in the interval between the Moscow talks and the meeting of thethree Heads of Governments ? General Smuts will be here, Mr. Mackenzie Kinghas promised to come, ancl Mr. Fraser is not likely to make difficulties. Mr. Curtinmay, but he could be told that this was his only chance of making his voiceeffectively heard before decisions were taken on these vital questions. At any rate,if he refused, Australia would have no complaint.[26163]Copy No.WAR CABINET.
Meanwhile, when the War Cabinet has agreed the provisional line which theForeign Secretary will take at Moscow, the Dominion Prime Ministers can beinformed of it. with an indication that this represents provisional views, subjectto reconsideration at the meeting of Prime Ministers in the light of the attitude adopted by the Americans and Russians at Moscow. This would hold theposition, for the time being.I greatly regret having to bring this matter again before the Cabinet. Butthe issues involved are very far-reaching, and a mistake made now might bedifficult to put right. Mr. Curtin has recently expressed doubts as to the adequacy of the existing machinery. Moreover, when, the other day, theAustralian Government proposed that the Four-Power Declaration should be signed, not by the United Kingdom but by the British Commonwealth of nations as a whole, we made it clear in our reply that this was in practice unnecessary,because there already existed means to ensure that adequate consultations could take place. If now it appears that this is not so. they will mistrust any futureassurances we may give them. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will give mostserious consideration to this proposal.C.Dominions Office, 30th September, 1943.
