NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Light craft have fought a number of successful engagements in theChannel.Allied submarines have attacked shipping off Corsica.M.T.Bs. have made a successful raid on Valona harbour.Enemy aircraft have caused several casualties among HAL and Allied ships in Leros harbour.Heavy casualties have been inflicted on the group of U-boats which attackedan Atlantic convoy.Shipping losses have been light.Norwegian Waters.2. On the morning of the 26th the pocket battleship lutzow, which hasspent a year in North Norway and is due for a refit, was sighted in company withfive destroyers off Trondheim steaming south. A striking force of naval aircraft which was sent to intercept her on the 27th failed to locate her. On the morning of the 29th she was sighted steaming south through the Sound.Home Waters.3. At least four groups of E-boats were operating off the South-East Coaston the night of the 24th/25th. One E-boat was destroyed by two M.Ls., whichwere damaged. Sixteen prisoners were captured. One of HAL trawlers was torpedoed and sunk and another was sunk in collision. Two E-boats were damaged by gunfire.On the same night coastal batteries shelled 16 enemy trawlers in the DoverStrait. Enemy batteries replied and some damage was caused to the naval base at Dover.Early on the 27th four S.G.Bs. attacked three enemy trawlers north ofHavre : one trawler was sunk, another was set on fire ancl the third was damaged.A little later a force of M.T.Bs. and M.G.Bs. probably sank a heavily escortedenemy ship proceeding up Channel off Etaples. An escort vessel was probablytorpedoed.   Only slight damage was sustained by our forces.Mediterranean.4. The supply of our forces in the Salerno area has continued satisfactorily,although adverse weather conditions hampered unloading on the 27th and the28th. Salerno harbour has been opened and coasters have resumed unloadingthere. On the 25th the U.S. minesweeper Skill was sunk by a U-boat in the gulf of Salerno.5. French cruisers, destroyers ancl submarines have carried reinforcementsancl supplies to Corsica. By the 27th 6,400 troops, 1,100 tons of stores ancl 134vehicles had been transported. Evacuation by the enemy of Bastia has continued by night and day. On the 23rd the Polish S/AI Dzik sank three Siebel ferries offBastia: ancl H.M. S/M Ultor on the 26th torpedoed a 10,000-ton tanker whichwas subsequently beached, and sank a Siebel ferry. H.M. S/M Uproar damaged a ship off Bastia, and Unseen torpedoed a ship ancl possibly another during patrolnorth of Corsica.6. On the 24th an Indian division reached Taranto : 19,600 troops, 1,850vehicles, and 5,500 tons of stores, were sailed in convoy from Middle East ports.From Tripoli (L) alone between the 18th and the 24th, 24,700 tons of cargo(inclusive of vehicles ancl guns) ancl 14,850 personnel were embarked for transport to Sicily and Italy. During the same period 9,300 tons were discharged. On the23rd a port party was landed at Bari. On the 28th the first convoy arrived atBrindisi, which is now used by destroyers patrolling the Strait of Otranto.7. On the night of the 21st/22nd M.T.Bs. entered the harbour of Valona(Albania) and sank a medium-sized ammunition ship ancl another smaller ship.Two other ships were damaged in the harbour before our forces withdrew underfile from enemy batteries. One M.T.B. was damaged but returned to harbour into. There were no casualties. On the 23rd the&quot; Germans were reported to beevacuating the Italian garrison of Valona.
8. On the 23rd the Germans landed on Corfu and occupied San Giorgio onthe following day. The Italian T.B. Stocco was sunk by aircraft while bom bar d-ing Corfu, and the Italian T.B. Sibilla was seriously damaged oft&apos; Otranto.Nineteen survivors from Stocco were rescued.9. During enemy air raids on Leros on the 26th the Greek destroyerQueen Olcja and H.M. destroyer Intrepid were sunk. Casualties in Queen ^ Olgawore about 50 killed, including the captain, and in Intrepid 15 killed or missing and three seriously wounded.&apos; Several Italian E-boats were also sunk and the docks were seriously damaged. The Italian destroyer Euro and a number ofother naval craft are available in Leros.Between the 12th and 21st, 2,500 personnel, 2,150 tons of stores, 1.250 tonsof petrol, 44 vehicles and 23 guns have been carried to Samos. Leros, Cos andCastelorizo.On the night of the 22nd/23rd H.M. destroyer Eclipse sank a westboundship off Rhodes and damaged an escort ship which was driven ashore and subse-quently sunk by aircraft.Seventy-two German prisoners were evacuated from Stampalia on the 22nd.A number of enemy ships loaded with troops and military stores is reported tohave sailed from the Piraeus for Crete and Rhodes.The Greek S/M Kdtsonis is overdue from patrol in the iEgean and must beconsidered lost.Pacific.10. With the increase of the area of occupation in New Guinea AlliedM.T.Bs. are operating more freely, and enemy barge traffic round the coast of theHuon Peninsula is being brought to a standstill.A Japanese converted aircraft-carrier in company with three cargo ships and six destroyers was sighted on the 24th north-east of Kavieng (New Ireland)probably making for Rabaui.On the 25th Japanese aircraft bombed and set on fire an Allied tank landingship off the coast of Vella Lavella.On the 26th the U.S. task force in Vella Gulf was unsuccessfully attacked by a U-boat.U.S. Marines have occupied Nanumea Island (Ellice Islands) without opposition.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. Thirty-eight attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week,24 by aircraft and 14 by surface craft. Between the 19th and the 24th surfaceand air escorts of the outward-bound convoy (which was repeatedly attacked by -boats in the N.W. Approaches) made 18 attacks on U-boats. Full details havenot yet been received, but three LJ-boats were probably sunk, one possibly sunk and six seriously damaged.A U-boat was rammed and possibly sunk by HALS. Tweed (frigate) in mid-Atlantic.Aircraft and destroyers possibly damaged a U-boat off Cape St. Vincent.Enemy Intelligence.German.12. The Graf Zeppelin is reported to have been towed from Stettin toSwinemunde.The Scheer was reported at Gdynia on the 18th and the Prim Eugen offGdynia on the following day.Reports of the movement southward of German troops from Norway continueto be received.Four possible blockade runners or U-boat supply ships were damaged atNantes during attacks by LLS. aircraft.It is reported that four ships at Bordeaux are preparing to run the blockade.U-boats.13.   It is considered that in the recent attack on an outward-bound atlantic convoy a new type of electric torpedo may have been used; this is thought to have[26158] B
a range of 3.000 yards and to be acoustically directed towards its target. Itsshort range may explain the aggressive policy now pursued by U-boats againstescort ships, which are usually on the perimeter of the convoy.There has been no contact with U-boats in the North Atlantic this week otherthan a chance encounter in mid-Atlantic. About six U-boats on passage of!&apos; thePortuguese coast may be attempting to pass into the Mediterranean.A U-boat is operating oh the coast of Brazil and a Japanese U-boat, inaddition to German U-boats, may be operating in the Gulf of Aden.On the 24th four Japanese U-boats were operating between Milne Bay (new guinea) and New Georgia (Solomons).Photographs taken on the 18th show a substantial advance in the work ofbuilding a U-boat base at Cape Janet, Marseilles.Enemy Attack on Shipping.14. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked four ships, twoof which are known to have sunk.One ship in an eastbound convoy was sunk off Bone and a U.S. ship was sunk off Aden. One ship was torpedoed north of Baia and another in the indian ocean west of Cochin.A provisional figure for shipping losses from enemy action during Septemberis 80,000 tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. During the week ending the 26th, 803 ships were convoyed. Of these210 ships were in ocean convoys and 593 in British coastal convoys. One cruiser,one escort carrier, 76 destroyers (including 15 U.S. destroyers). 100 sloops, cutters,frigates and corvettes (including five U.S. cutters and one French sloop), were employed on escort duties.Three ocean convoys, consisting of 140 ships1, arrived in Home waters without loss.16. During the week ending the 25th, imports into the United kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 480,000 tons, compared with 1.003,000 tons duringthe previous seven days and an average of 1,000,000 tons during the past ten weeks.   Of the week&apos;s imports 156,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.British Minelaying.17. During the week surface craft laid mines in Northern Waters and inthe Channel.Aircraft laid mines off the Frisian Islands, oft&apos; the Dutch coast, and in theKattegat.Enemy Minelaying, British Mines weeping.18. The darker nights have brought an increase in enemy minelaying bothby aircraft and surface craft.On three nights during the week enemy aircraft were operating off theS.F. Coast between the Humber and Harwich, probably minelaying.Groups of E-boats were minelaying in the Thames approaches on the night of the 24th/25th, and on two nights off Calais.During the week 16 ground mines have been destroyed off the S.E. Coast,and five moored mines have been cut in Lyme Bay.The mine totals are : 4,485 ground and 3,262 moored.An inshore route has been established from the south-east point of italy to Brindisi and Bari. The sweeping of a channel into the port of Castellamarewas begun on the 28th.Sixty-nine more mines have been destroyed off Cotrone.During August no enemy minelaying was reported fi &apos;om Malta, but 25 moored mines were destroyed.Italian Merchant Shipping.19. Thirty-four Italian ships (94,363 tons) have now arrived in ports under allied control in the Mediterranean.
Enemy Merchant Shipping.20. The German tanker Nord Atlantic (9,897 tons) arrived at Ferrol on the20 th.The Rumanian s.s. Alba Julia (5,701 tons) sailed from Istanbul on the 27thfor Black Sea ports with a cargo of chrome.Three Spanish ships engaged in trading ore to the enemy in theMediterranean have been reported. The s.s. BacM (3,091 tons) sailed fromValencia on the 21st for Sete. the s.s. Sebastian (3,354 tons) arrived at Valenciaon the 20th from Tarragona, and the s.s Torn (3,056 tons) arrived at Sagunta fromSete on the 19th.Spanish Intelligence.21. The Italian Ambassador in Madrid has been handed a personal letterfrom Marshal Badoglio, instructing him to co-operate as fully as possible withthe Allies, and in particular to secure as soon as possible the release of the Italianwarships and merchantmen now interned by the Spaniards.On the 23rd the Spanish Minister of Marine instructed the authorities atLas Palmas to allow the three Danish ships which had been immobilised atLas Palmas to sail.   They will leave in due course for the United Kingdom.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map is included as an inset.)Smolensk Sector.22. With the capture of Smolensk on the 25th the Russians gained anothergreat success. Roslavl also fell on the same clay, and the Russians have since thencontinued to make good progress on a wide front. The Germans are reportedto be fortifying a line covering the railway Vitebsk-Orsha.Gomel Sector.23. The Russians have advanced quickly astride the three railways leadingfrom Bryansk. Bakhmach and Chernigov to Gomel and have reached a point11 miles south-east of the latter town.Dnieper Sector.24. As a result of a further advance on a wide front the Russians have now reached, or almost reached, the Dnieper along its&apos;entire length from its confluencewith the Beresina to Zaporozhe. The Germans have reported Russian attempts to cross the Dnieper at various points, and have even admitted that a few weakdetachments had succeeded in gaining a foothold on the western bank, but theRussians have made no reference to any such activity.Owing to the speed of their withdrawal in recent weeks, the Germans havenow retired behind the Dnieper well before the autumn rains, which might havehelped their delaying operations. In consequence the Russians may well try toestablish bridgeheads on the west bank of the Dnieper while the weather holds.Zaporozhe-M.elitopol Sector.25. On the 22nd the Russians took Vassilevka on the railway Zaporozhe-Melitopol, but since then have made no further progress in this sector.Taman Bridgehead.26. The Russians are steadily forcing the Germans from the bridgehead,ihey have captured Anapa and Temryuk, and the Germans have withdrawn to aline where the big lakes will help them to fight rearguard actions. A partialevacuation of German troops from the bridgehead is believed to have taken place,and it seems likely that the bridgehead will be given up completely in the nearfuture. Some of the forces already evacuated are reported as operating inthe Melitopol area, and it is probable that the remainder will be used for thedefence of the Crimea and its northern approaches.[261.58] b 2
Italy.(An outline map is included as an inset.)27. With the build-up of our forces in Apulia and the loosening of theGerman hold on the heights above Salerno our position in Italy is nowconsiderably stronger. In the Taranto area specialist troops acting with greatspeed and initiative cleared the Heel and got as far north as Altamura. Theywere, however, very thin on the ground and our operations were not much morethan fighting patrols. It was not until the 24th that further formations arrived,and since that date we have been able to build up a strong force, including aconsiderable weight of armour, and our positions are strongly established.In the centre British and Canadian forces have fought, their way doggedlynorthwards, interrupted by occasional rear guards and constant demolitions.Casualties have been light, but the efforts of our troops, particularly of the engineers and supply columns, have been considerable. Contact has been frimly established on the right flank with formations from Taranto and on their left with US. forces from the Fifth Army.Similar success has been achieved by the U.&apos;S. Fifth Army. After a week&apos;sbitter fighting the enemy positions above Solerno have finally been overcome byBritish &quot;troops. It was a victory for our infantry and. artillery, but with thepasses through Nocera to Xaples now firmly in our bands our armour isdescending upon the Neapolitan plain ancl advancing rapidly.28. On the 25th fresh British formations were concentrating near Barlettawith a mobile force striking north-east. This force crossed the Ofanto river onthe 26th and patrolled forward towards Manfredonia on the coast and towardsFoggia. Foggia with its great network of airfields and communications is ofimmense importance to us and this the Germans must fully realise. In spite ofthis, they were unable to spare sufficient forces to make any determined standand announced the intention of an orderly evacuation and a planned withdrawal to mountain positions further north. However, British armour was able to bring their rear guards to battle ancl inflicted considerable casualties on them. Thetown itself was captured on the 27th and our patrols are now some 20 miles north-west and west of the town. The maintenance situation is satisfactorythrough the ports of Taranto and Bari.29. In the centre British ancl Canadian forces have continued to fight andwin their war against demolished bridges, mines and narrow7 twisting- roads.Action has been confined to short battles against rear guards alone; thePotenza-Melfi road. The town of Melfi was captured on the 27th. further progress has been made northwards and the area to the east has been cleared ofthe enemy.30. In the Fifth Army area definite progress has been made. On the right flank U.S. divisions advanced steadily against mines and small determinedrearguards. The Germans were not making any definite stand, however, and onthe 26th our forces were astride the lateral road connecting S. Angelo andAvellino. They have now swung west and are directed on Avellino which isreported to have been entered by our patrols on the 29th.On the left British troops started to attack northwards from Salerno on the night 22nd/23rd. Their object was to break the enemy hold on the high groundaround Nocera and then bring forward their armour to deploy on the Naplesplain. The enemy had concentrated his maximum fire power into many naturallystrong defensive positions, and it was not until the 27th, after five clays&apos; bitterfighting, that any appreciable advance was made. On that clay Baronissi was captured. The same day a strong enemy counter-attack gained some ground,but the following night the position was restored and our advance continued.On the 28th Mercato and Nocera were in our hands ancl our armoured formationswere able to move forward through the passes towards Naples. Pompeii was occupied the same day. Our forces are now advancing towards Naples throughSarno on the right and along the coast road on the left where a strong bridgeheadhas been established across the R. Sarno. The weather has broken during theweek with heavy rain and high winds. As a result supply over the beaches wascurtailed and our mud airfields near Salerno have become difficult to operate.Unloading has now been resumed and our maintenance situation is entirely satisfactory.
Corsica.31. German forces have been withdrawing- northwards along the Hast Coastroad from Bonifacio to Bastia at increased speed. The evacuation of troops and heavy material from Bastia to Leghorn has been considerably impeded by allied air attacks on harbour installations. The airfields at Borgo and Ghisonaccia,however, have played an important part in the evacuation of troops. To assistthose Germans withdrawing in small boats and landing craft, temporary landing-stages have been erected at suitable beaches between Bastia and Brando.The enemy has now evacuated more than half his forces, amountingoriginally to a strong division (90 Panzer Gren. Div. and S.S. Bde.), as well as some Italian Fascist elements from Sardinia.On the 23rd the enemy evacuated Porto Vecchio afte? carrying out consider-aide demolitions. Elements of a French Assault Battalion, together with strong-Patriot forces attacking from Zonza and Levie, had been constantly harassingthe German left flank and rear parties moving towards Solenzara.On the 25th Ghisonaccia airfield was abandoned by the Germans who by the20th had withdrawn to Aleria. Elements of Italian 10 Bersaglieri Regiment,co-operating with French Patriots, seized Piedicorte on the 27th. At the sametime, strong reinforcements of French troops continued to press north-easttowards Bastia along the Ponte Leccia-Casamozza road.The Germans now hold a bridgehead extending along a narrow strip of theEast Coast from Brando, on Cap Corse, to the Etang de Diane, north of Aleria.A complete evacuation of Corsica is expected within the next few days.French forces operating in Corsica now number some 5,000-6,000 men,including a Regiment of Moroccan Tirailleurs, a Groupe de Tabors, an AssaultBattalion, a squadron of light tanks, as well as some mountain and L.A.A.artillery^   Patriot forces are estimated at 12.000.Eastern Mediterranean.32. Our position on the islands of Castelorizo, Cos, Leros, and Samos, isnow reasonably secure and in addition we have established outposts on Symi,Stampalia, Calymnos and Nicaria. A patrol has also been established on the island of Gyaros (75 miles south-east of Athens) to report on enemy air movement.Maintenance of our garrisons in this area (which now total upward of3,800 all ranks including R.A.F.) is being carried out by H.M. ships, air transport,landing craft, small merchant ships and caiques.33.   Patrols have been active on all fronts.    In Arakan, although theJapanese may have withdrawn one regiment (leaving one regiment plus one battalion), they are still holding all their forward positions covering theMaungdaw-Buthedaurig road.New Guinea.34. An Australian brigade continued to advance from the Salamaua area without serious opposition, and has now made contact on the Markham River withthe Australian division which advanced on Lae from the west. During this advance they broke up a pocket of Japanese resistance on the south bank of theMarkham River, about six miles from the mouth. Considerable casualties havealso been inflilctecl on the enemy in the area of swamps and lagoons on the coastsouth of the mouth of the Markham River. The remnants of the Japanesegarrison from Lae are reported to be dispersed in the mountains between theMarkham Valley and the sea and along the coast in the Saidor area betweenMadang and Finschhafen. Australian forces have advanced eastwards along thecoast from Lae as far as Hanisch Harbour (20 miles west of Finschhafen) withoutmeeting opposition, and have crossed the mouth of the Mongi River.Latest reports of enemy dead counted are :  Burma.Salamaua Area From 30th June to 25th August ...From 26th August to 15th September ...2.2271,915Lae A red From 14th September to 15th September2,240Total
35. Near Kaiapit, in the Upper Markham Valley, an enemy counter-attack by about 200 Japanese was repulsed with about 120 casualties. Our patrols,continuing their advance up the Markham Valley, have contacted small parliesof the enemy eight miles north-west of Kaiapit. Captured documents show thatthe enemy intended to reinforce the Markham Valley area with a task force the advanced groups of which were to leach Kaiapit by the 20th September. Onthe 21st part of an Australian battalion, followed by their Brigade Headquarters,landed from aircraft at Kaiapit. The force lias now pushed on a furthereight miles north-west.36. On the morning of the 22nd an Australian Brigade landed from bargesunder cover of a heavy naval and air bombardment about five miles north ofFinschhafen. There was little opposition and the Australian casualties are verylight. There was no enemy air opposition till 0930 hours. One battalion hasmoved south to within half-a-mile of Finschhafen town, capturing the airfield.Elements of this battalion, with two platoons of the Papuan Infantry Battalion,have penetrated five-and-a-half miles inland. Patrols from another battalion have moved three-and-a-half miles north from the landing place without making contact with the enemy. Australian artillery are shelling Finschhafen. The main enemyconcentration is reported to be about one mile south of the town.Solomons.37.   Japanese resistance on Arundel Island has now ceased.A Japanese garrison is reported at Gizo, a small island off the west coast ofKolombangara, which is still in Japanese hands.AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. At night, Mannheim, Hanover and Bochum were heavily bombed by aircraft of Bomber Command. By day, Fortresses (B. 17) attacked Emden inforce and intensive raids were made on a number of airfields in France.In Italy, attacks were maintained against enemy communications. Heavyraids were made on the railway centres at Bologna and Pisa.In the New Guinea theatre, Allied aircraft had considerably the better ofthe air fighting and, in addition to casualties inflicted in combat, destroyed anumber of Japanese aircraft on the ground.United Kingdom.39. In daylight, no enemy aircraft were reported over land. On two nights,a total of 25 enemy aircraft crossed the East Coast and carried out some scatteredbombing; the majority of these were Me. 410s engaged on intruder operations.Home Waters.40. In operations off the Dutch Islands, Typhoon bombers destroyed a tugand a barge and damaged three coasters (one of 2,000 tons and two of 800 tons),three tugs, three R-boats and three barges. At other times, attacks were carriedout on similar targets but results could not be observed. Twenty-seven escortedBeaufighters of Coastal Command attacked a convoy off Holland, torpedoing two ships and damaging four escort vessels; flak was exceptionally heavy and twoBeaufighters were lost.Seven Ju. 88s were intercepted by four Mosquitoes over the Bay of Biscay;two of the enemy aircraft were destroyed, another probably destroyed, and threedamaged for the loss of one Mosquito. Three Wellingtons did not return fromanti-U-Boat patrol in this area on one night.Seventy-five aircraft of Bomber Command laid 287 sea mines in enemy waters: one bomber did not return.Single daily flights of up to 20 hours&apos; duration have recently been made 1&apos;)&apos;B.V. 222 (six-engined flying-boats). On one such flight, the aircraft wasidentified in mid-Atlantic (55&quot; N 30o W), 1,000 miles from its base on the FrenchAtlantic coast.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.41. On the 27th, Fortresses (B. 17) dropped 525 tons of bombs in an attackon the port area at Emden, while others dropped 140 tons on Aurich, Esens and adjacent objectives. Twelve squadrons of Thunderbolts (P. 47) provided targetsupport.Escorted Fortresses (B. 17) also attacked the Fort area, railway centre and shipping at Nantes &quot;(290 tons were dropped),* and carried out substantial raids on airfields at Kerlin/Bastard* and Vannes/Meucan,* upon which a total ot&apos;289 tons was released. An attack was made on Eheims; the target was theJunkers aircraft assembly works and 104 tons were dropped with good effect.Ten Fortresses (B. 17) did not return from these missions. Enemy casulties are provisionally claimed by the bombers to be destroyed 29, probably destroyed25, damaged 18.On three occasions Marauders (B. 26) attacked Beauvais/Tille airfield; ineach instance about 75 tons were released. They also bombed Conches airfieldtwice, dropping 92 and 74 tons* and, in attacks on the airfields at St. Omer/Longuevilleand Evreux/Fauville, dropped 90 and 86 tons respectively. Mitchells(B. 25) had as their targets the Guipavas and Lanveoc-Poulmic airfields at brest, the Grand Quevilly power station and the railway centre at Rouen andthe railway centre at Amiens; the bombs dropped on these objectives totalled112 tons. Typhoons, Whirlwinds and Mustangs (P. 51) also raided airfields in France and, in addition, attacked lock-gates in Holland and transportationin Belgium and France; 20 trains, 11 locomotives, several lorries and 14 bargeswere destroyed or severely damaged.During- the week, Spitfires and Thunderbolts (P. 47) destroyed 47 enemy air-craft, probably destroyed 15 and damaged 36 for the loss of 20. In addition.Thunderbolts (P. 47), covering the operations against Emden on the 27th.destroyed 20 German fighters, probably destroyed two and damaged six. for oneThunderbolt (P. 47) missing.Night.42. On the 23rd/24th, Mannheim and Darmstadt were attacked by 535 and29 bombers respectively. On the 27th/28th. 544 bombed Flanover and 25 attackedBrunswick.   On the 29th/30th, 304 aircraft operated against Bochum.The three principal operations were concentrated within approximately30 minutes in each instance, during which time 1.855 tons were dropped atMannheim, 2,198 tons at Hanover and 1,374 tons at Bochum. Five Fortresses(B. 17) formed part of the forces engaged in two of these attacks; one is missing.Eighteen hours after our bombers had left Mannheim, a Spitfire reconnoitredthe area; columns of smoke were then rising from the centre of the city and fires were still burning in the dock area and in Ludwigshaven.* At Flanover, themain wreight of bombs fell on the south-east and north-east of the town. Bombingat Bochum was well-concentrated on the target area marked by Pathfinders, withsome spread towards the north, where fires were heaviest. Eighty-four tons were released on Darmstadt and 78 tons on Brunswick.From the week&apos;s offensive operations against land targets, 80 aircraft of bomber Command did not return about 4^- per cent, of the total numberdespatched.A total of 46 Mosquitoes bombed Cologne (attacked three times). Duisburg,Aachen, Gelsenkirchen (each attacked twice), dusseldorf and Emden.Mosquitoes and Beaufighters, on intruder patrols over Germany, France and holland, shot clown 12 enemy aircraft; one Mosquito is missing.Italy.43.   Medium bombers concentrated their attacks on roads and road and railway bridges leading to the battle area; the bombers of the Tactical Air Forceattempted to create a road block.   Some strategical bombing operations we?hampered by unfavourable weather.Targets approximately 40-50 miles&apos; distant from Salerno included Mignano(24 miles E.N.E. of Gaeta) and Formia (three miles N.E. of Gaeta). Four attacks by Mitchells (B. 25) were made on Mignano, where a bridge was bombed and hits were made on the road curve. Wellingtons twice effectively bombed the railway centre and roads at Formia, releasing 181 tons of bombs.* Fide Appendix VI for assessment of results.
Other targets to be attacked were situated beyond Naples or in a radius ofapproximately 25-35 miles of Salerno; the raids were carried out by formationsof 18 to 38 bombers. At Cancello (N.E. of Naples), the road bridge was almost completely destroyed by several direct hits, and at Capua (18 miles N. of Naples)the middle span of the main road bridge was cut, but the enemy was using therailway bridge for road traffic: the railway was blocked by earth from a bombedembankment. At Amorosi (26 miles N.E. of Naples) the road was blocked byfive craters and the railway was blocked by debris. Other targets where hits were obtained on bridges, railways or roads included Grottaminarda (29 miles N.N.K.of Salerno). Maddaloni (six miles N.N.E. of Naples), Benevento, Ponte (E. ofNaples), Caserta (18 miles N.E. of Naples) and Cancillo Arnone (15 miles N.N.W.of Naples).To the north of the Salerno battle area, attacks were made on the roadjunctions at Avellino and Nocera, and on gun positions and trooj:) concentrationsat Mercatello. St. Lucia and Sarno. Fighter-bombers operated over the battle area and successfully attacked motor transport, gun positions and other military objectives, and fighters patrolled the invasion beaches.The airfields at Aquino (N.W. of Naples) and Viterbo (N. of Rome) and the seaplane base of Lago di Bracciano (18 miles N.W. of Rome) were attacked byMustangs (A. 36) and 11 aircraft were destroyed and seven others damaged.A heavy attack by Fortresses (B. 17) was made on the marshalling yards atBologna; 269 tons of bombs were dropped and considerable damage was caused to railroad property. Over 220 tons of bombs were released on Pisa railway centre and on the Pisa/San Giusto airfield by Wellingtons and Liberators (B. 24); a railway bridge and three road bridges were hit. the through railroad tracks weresevered by numerous hits, the road over the pass was cratered and many aircraftAvere left burning on the landing ground. Over 80 Wellingtons attacked theNorth Basin at Leghorn, concentrating on small craft and medium-sized motorvessels, and small-scale attacks were made on Bolzano and Verona.A notable feature has been the cessation of enemy long-range bomber attacks,and the exceptionally low single-engined fighter effort over the battle areaNaples-Foggia. Fighter-bombers made from 15-30 sorties daily against our troop concentrations and M/T. There was little reaction to widespread Allied offensive operations. The very low scale of effort put up by the G.A.F. indicates that theinitiative is already strongly held by the Allies.Corsica.44. Beaufighters intercepted enemy transport aircraft from Corsica, 26 ofwhich they destroyed, probably destroyed four and damaged seven others for theloss of four Beaufighters. some of the crews of which were rescued. An attack-was made on Bastia/Borgo airfield by 36 Mitchells (B. 25).Mediterranean.Dodecanese, Crete and Greece.45. The German Air Forces in the Greece-^aegean area have been considerably reinforced and on three occasions Antimachia landing ground(Cos Island) has been attacked by 15-24 Ju. 88s escorted by Me. 109s and renderedtemporarily unserviceable; one Ju. 88 was destroyed and four Spitfires were shot down. Enemy bombers escorted by fighters made three attacks on LerosHarbour (Leros Island) and destroyed two Cant Z 501s on the water and damaged a seaplane hangar and some shipping.In order to prevent the Germans from neutralising these bases by air bombardment, attacks have been made on airfields at Maritza, Calato, Cattavia(Rhodes Island) Castelli Pediada (Cr^ete) and Calamaki (Athens).Syros Harbour (72 miles S.E. of Athens) was attacked on four occasions, ware-houses were hit, a caique of 80 tons was sunk and smoke was seen rising from a ship of 2,000 tons after an attack by Beaufighters. A destroyer oft&apos; Cape Prasso(Rhodes) was sunk.Russia.46. During the week, the Russian Air Force were engaged in offensive operations chiefly directed against the German forces retreating over the Dnieperand withdrawing from the Kuban. On the 21st, repeated attacks weremade on German troop concentrations and on the bridges over the Dnieper
in the area of Dnepropetrovsk and also on airfields in that locality; many air-craft are stated to have been destroyed on the ground and fourteen shot down in combat! On the -27th, in the course of similar operations, 21 German aircraft were stated to have been shot down.Reports have been received of incessant attacks on the German lines of withdrawl from the Kuban. Large quantities of M/T are stated to have been damaged or destroyed, and stores of fuel and ammunition blown up. Ports intin- Taman area were bombed and damage done to shipping there.Night bombing operations took place on the nights of the 2()th/21st, whenthe main targets were the railway junctions of Gomel and Vitebsk, and on the26th/27th, when railway objectives&apos; at Gomel Orsha. Dshankoi (in the Crimea)and Bobrinskaya (18 miles south-west of Cherkass) were strongly attacked.The G.A.F. proved &quot;completely unable to hold up the Soviet advance duringthe past week on any sectors of the Russian front from the Vitebsk-Smolenskarea&apos;south.wards to the Black Sea. As a result primarily of fighter weakness, theG.A.F. is believed no longer to be a match for the Russian Air Force on any sector of the front. Moreover, on many sectors the ground troops are believed to behunting without any air cover whatever. This air weakness is due above all elseto failure, owing to ever-growing commitments on other fronts, to reinforce theG.A.F in Russia, with the result that units operating in Russia have had no opportunity to recuperate from the intensive operations of the last three months.As a result, the first-line strength of the G.A.F. on the Russian front, estimatedat some 2,600 aircraft at the beginning of July, is believed to amount at presentlo no more than 1,550-1,600 aircraft, with serviceability probably not in excessin most units of 50 per cent, of strength.The forces on the Central front, believed to amount to no more than 400first-line aircraft for the whole area from Kiev to Vitebsk, are totally inadequate for the tasks facing them: hence the rapid Soviet advance to Smolensk and Kievwhich has been the outstanding feature of the past week&apos;s operations.Burma.47. During the week ended the 26th, although weather generally was poor,about 190 bomber and 200 fighter sorties were flown, aLiberators (B. 24) dropped 31 tons of bombs on railway yards at Letpadan,76 miles X. of Rangoon, starting several fires. A Mitchell (B. 25) made three hitson a bridge over Mu River, 30 miles W.S.W. of Mandalay, and others caused considerable damage to the main line and sidings at Kyaukse, 25 miles S. of Mandalay.Damaging raids were carried out by fighters on Japanese communications in western and North-Western Burma: 11 locomotives, about 60 units of rolling-stock and several lorries were effectively attacked. On the Irrawaddy andChindwin and off the Arakan coast damage was inflicted on eight large and 70smaller river craft and on a very large number of sampans.China Zone.48. Japanese activity increased. On the 20th. 34 bombers, escorted by 20fighters, attacked the airfield at Kunming (Yunnan Province), destroying onetransport aircraft and damaging seven others on the ground. The raiders were intercepted by Kittyhawks (P. 40), and 15 bombers and two fighters were destroyed, while 16 more enemy aircraft were severely damaged; Allied loss wasone Kittyhawk (P. 40). Enemy aircraft bombed Kienow airfield (430 miles N.E.of Flong Kong) later in the week and 13 hits were made on the runway. Otherhostile raids, in most instances by about nine aircraft, were made on airfields atWuchow (110 miles W. of Canton). N aiming (320 miles W. of Canton), Namyung(155 miles N.N.E. of Canton). Kukong (140 miles N. of Canton). Changsha (175miles S.S.W. of Hankow) and Pingsiang (20 miles N. of Haiphong).Pacific Zone.A eiv Guinea.49.   The landing of Allied  troops  at  Finschhafen on  the 22nd  (videMilitary Situation) was supported by strong air attacks.   About 25 enemvbombers escorted by 35 fighters, attempting to attack our shipping, were met by1261581 c
88 Allied fighters: ten of the bombers and 29 of the fighters were destroyed forthe loss of three Lightnings (P. 38).Escorted heavy bombers dropped 51 tons of bombs on Japanese communica-tions in the Gogul River/Bogadyim sector -three bridges over the MindyimRiver and another over the Gogul River were destroyed. Bomb-carrying Aira-cobras (P. 39) caused extensive landslides in the Markham and Ramu valleys and,later, similar results were achieved by Liberators (B. 24).On the 20th, escorted Liberators (B. 24) dropped 46 tons of bombs on Wewakand Borum airfields; five enemy fighters were shot down and one Allied fighter is missing. On the 27th, a total of 110 Allied heavy and medium bombers, coveredby 120 fighters, attacked the Wewak airfields and shipping in that area. At leasteight enemy fighters were shot down, and it is estimated that about 50 Japanese aircraft were destroyed on the ground; three freighters, each of about 3.000 tons,three small tanker-type vessels, a sea truck, nine luggers, five launches and Y2barges were either sunk or seriously damaged On the following day, 145 tons were dropped in the Wewak area by escorted Liberators (B. 24), resulting in thedestuction of the main ammunition storage dump; of 40 intercepting fighters,eight were shot down.New Britain.50. On the 22nd. heavy and medium bombers, with an escort of fighters,attacked the Japanese airfield at Cape Gloucester: 74 tons of bombs were released and it is believed that the landing strips were rendered unserviceable.Solomons.51. On the 23rd. escorted heavy and dive-bombers attacked enemy positions in the Kahili. Buin region (Bougainville Island); 60 J apanese fighters tried to intercept the attack and shot down one Allied fighter, losing nine of their own.The same objectives were also attacked on the 26th. when hits were made in thesupply, bivouac and hangar aieas.On the 25th. Japanese dive-bombers started a large fire among our positions at Kundurumbangara Point (Vella Lavella).Kai Islands.52. On the 2ist. when returning from bombing Langgoer airfield, threeLiberators (B. 24) were met by 12 enemy fighters, six of whom were destroyed;one Liberator (B. 24) was lost.Australia.53. On the 27th. considerable damage to Drysdale River Mission (300 miles.W. of Darwin) resulted from a raid by escorted enemy bombers; the airfield was slightly damaged.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.54. On two nights of the week, minor bombing occurred at a number ofscattered points in East Coast Counties. At Ipswich, damage was caused to property and there was one fatal casualty.During the early hours of the 25th, a few shells from the French coast fell inDover and in Folkestone; at the latter, house property was damaged and therewere two fatal and two serious casualties.Casualties.55.

All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3)).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire.co

In addition a floating dock was hit in two places and is partlysubmerged.An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 23rd andthe 24th September after the two U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 23rd September,shows further considerable damage to shipping in the Port Maritime. Four largevessels were hit. comprising an Altmark-type tanker which was severely damaged,and an escort vessel of Sans Souci type, an M/V of 460 ft., and a tanker of 450 ft.,all three of which were on fire at the time of photography. A dredger 200-250 ft.was sunk and another tanker was superficially damaged. A floating clock of450 ft. has been breached for a length of 100 ft. Dockside buildings have againsuffered, and the port railway marshalling yards, station and goods depot have all been damaged; in the marshalling yards many wagons have been damaged andderailed.
Conchas Airfield. Photographs taken on the 23rd September after theCJ.S.A.A.F. attack earlier in the day, show that one aircraft shelter has been destroyed, one half-destroyed and another damaged. On the east side of the airfield, one barrack hut has been destroyed and two severely and one slightly damaged. In addition, there are two craters on the runway, two on the perimetertrack and some four dozen on the landing ground.Eoreuxj Fauville Airfield. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 23rd September after the U.S.A.A.F. attack&apos; on the 22nd September,shows that the principal damage has occurred in the west dispersal area, wherethree aircraft shelters have been destroyed, one severely damaged, anotherdamaged and many smaller buildings probably damaged. In the north-east andsouth-east dispersal areas, there are many craters among shelters and buildings,while a medium air-craft on the north of the airfield has been severely damaged.There are 11 craters on the runways. An assembly tarmac ancl the taxi-trackshave many craters, and there are a large number on the airfield.BeauvaisITille Airfield. Photographs taken on the 23rd September, showthat, as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 18th September, a hangar andone medium aircraft in the west dispersal area have been damaged. an ammunition dump adjoining the north dispersal area has received at least sixdirect hits and was still on fire five days after the attack. In the north-eastrefuelling area, two sheds have been destroyed ancl three more damaged. Thereare two craters on the north-west ancl south-east runway ancl many on taxi-tracks,a servicing tarmac ancl the airfield.Lille )N ord. Photographs taken on the 23rd September, after theTJ.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 3rd September and the 8th September, show that twodispersal hangars were severely damaged and three slightly.

Photographs taken on the 23rd September, after theU.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 8th and 9th September, show that a large double hangar,a 3-bay hangar, three probable workshops and several smaller station buildings have been damaged. Seven aircraft shelters have received slight damage. Thereare about 14 craters on the taxi-tracks ancl a large number on the airfield.La Pallice. An immediate interpretation of rather small-scale photographs taken on the 23rd September shows that as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 16th September, severe chrmage was caused in the area of the wet dock, anclone of the lock-gates seems to have been destroyed. The inclined plane approach to the U-boat pens has been destroyed in two places. At least two of the railway station buildings ancl several dock buildings have been damaged, many of themseriously.Kerlin I Bastard Airfield. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. daylight attack on the 23rd September, shows that, inthe north dispersal area, the main hangar has been destroyed, ancl at least four(probably ten) small hangars damaged ; two barrack-type buildings have also been destroyed. Three aircraft in this area have suffered damage. In the southdispersal area, one hangar has been damaged and there are several hits on thesouth-east dispersal area. There arc between 15 and 20 craters on the runwaysand a. large concentration of craters at both the north ancl south end of the airfield.VannesIMeucon Airfield. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 23rd September, shows that one large and two small hangars have been, destroyed and two small hangars damaged.Several barrack buildings have been destroyed or damaged. In addition, thereare at least 30 craters on the runways and many on the taxi-tracks, while a largeconcentration of bursts in the centre of the airfield covers nearly one-third ofits area.Romilly-sur-Seine Airfield.
