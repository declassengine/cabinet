THE PRIME MINISTER, after expressing his pleasure at having this opportunity of meeting the Dominions Representatives and the heads of I hevarious United Kingdom Missions, referred to the recent developments in Italyand gave an account of the most recent events the German attack on the italian fleet while the latter in observance of the Armistice terms was making its way to allied ports; the Anglo-American landing at Salerno; the British capture ofTaranto. The Italian developments were very favourable to the Allied causeand should entail a great accession of strength to the United Nations. There was now the chance not only of freeing Italy from the Nazi yoke but of bringingItaly into the war against Germany and of definitely turning the Italians againstthe Germans for many years to come. It was no part of British policy to destroy jItaly. The&apos;Italians would have to work their passage, but if they did so and if /they faithfully observed the terms of the Armistice, they were entitled to benefit by their actions and it would be the responsibility of the Allies to see that theydid not suffer thereby. The Germans would no doubt do all in their power to resist and would iii all probability take very severe measures against theItalians indeed Hitler!s latest speech foreshadowed this. Nevertheless thethe Allied victories in Libya. North Africa, Sicily and Italy all of which flowedfrom the Anglo-American&apos; decision to invade North Africa had resulted in theisolation of Germany and had greatly facilitated the task of the Allies in thefuture. The capture of Taranto was very important opening up as it did theway to the Adriatic and the Balkans, where it was to be hoped the Italian troops would now- be able to establish friendly contact with the patriot forces in greece and Yugoslavia. The German position in the Balkans would certainly greatlydeteriorate.THE PRIME MINISTER emphasised that one of the most signficant factswas that the recent victories had greatly facilitated and consolidated the close co-operation between the British and Americans, both in the field and in the combined Chiefs of Staff organisation in Washington. The growth of this spiritof co-operation had had a great influence on Americans in general. For example,the remarks which he had made on the subject in his recent speech at Harvardhad been widely approved in the United States, whereas if he had made thema year ago they would have aroused much criticism, tie was convinced that, ashe had said at Harvard, the Combined Chiefs of Staff organisation should he maintained not only until the end of the war but for a considerable time after-wards perhaps for 10 years until the period of post-war uncertainty wassafely over. While he thought this organisation should for the time being remainAnglo-American, he would not exclude the eventual inclusion of other countries,though he would be in no hurry to bring them in. Nor would it be advisable to try to assign any time limit for the continuance of the organisation. He hoped to see this practice of Anglo-American collaboration spread and develop, but he did not think that formal machinery would necessarily be required in all cases.Much might be achieved by informal consultation and collaboration. In general,he regarded the recent advance and improvement of opinion and feeling betweenthe United States and the United Kingdom as most important. As an example of this improvement he pointed out that his recent remarks at Harvard had beenvery sympathetically received by the representatives of the Republican Party attheir meeting at Mackinak Island. In this connexion, he emphasised how important it was that British representatives in the United States should hecareful, whatever their personal feelings, not to take sides as between theDemocrats and the Republicans, or the Administration and the Opposition.THE PRIME MINISTER, said that, as the result of the events in Italy, wemust contemplate a heavier war on a broader battle front. In addition to thefront which would now open in Italy, a third front would be opened elsewhere indue course at the right time. This should satisfy the Russians, who had hitherto \taken the line that they had had an undue share of the fighting. While there was some force to this argument, there was no point in opening up another front orshedding bloocl just to please the Russians. Nor had the Russians themselvesentered the war except to protect their own interests. Nevertheless it was thepolicy of the United Kingdom to work with the Russians. He himself was prepared to be patient with the Russians and would not be deterred by harshwords from his efforts to reach agreement with them. He was always prepared tobe snubbed for his country. He hoped that it would be possible before long tobring about a Three-Power meeting between President Roosevelt, Mr. Stalin and himself at which progress could be made with laying the foundations for thefuture.   He was convinced, however, that we should do much better with the
Russians if we first got on to intimate terms with the United States. It was important not allow the Russians to try to play the United States and the UnitedKingdom oft&apos; against each other.THE PRIME MINISTER then asked whether those present had any questions to ask or statements to make.SIR HENRY SELF said that as regards production generally the most acuteproblem at the moment on both sides of the Atlantic was the man-power question.It was rather difficult for the British representatives in the United States to press the Americans to increase their production, when the only real solution was the putting into force by the Administration of some form of compulsory service.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the United States Governmentwould, in fact, take some steps in this direction before long.SIR HENRY SELF said that American production was likely to fall about10 per cent, below the target figures. He thought, however, that in practice thisproduction, both as regards quantity and quality, would be sufficient to meetactual requirements.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that actual requirements had fallenconsiderably belowr the estimated figures for various reasons such as theimprovement in the shipping losses. In this connection he pointed out thatduring the last week for which figures were available, no United States or UnitedKingdom merchant ships had been sunk.SIR RICHARD FAIREY asked whether the United Kingdom could usemore aircraft from the United States. The United States production of combat aircraft was likely to fall 20 per cent, below the target figure. This drop was dueto labour difficulties, and it should be possible for production to be increasedappreciably.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was optimistic as regard Americanproduction which, once it got under way, produced astonishing results. He felt it would be a mistake to press the Americans too hard in the matter.AIR MARSHAL SIR WILLIAM WELSH said that any additional air-craft that the United States could produce could certainly be used. additional aircraft would be particularly useful in enabling the United States to accelerate the training of their air crews. The shortage of trained American air crews was at present causing a serious bottle-neck.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether the new types of United Statesheavy bomber were satisfactory.AIR MARSHAL SIR WILLIAM WELSH pointed out that these newAmerican bombers could not carry a bomb heavier than 500 lbs.SIR RICHARD FAIREY said the United States had recently agreed tomake parts for Lancasters to be assembled in Canada. It was proposed to makeparts sufficient for 60 Lancasters per month, but this would not become effective for 15 months. Deliveries of Canadian manufactured Lancasters had juststarted, and it was hoped gradually to build up this production to 40 a month.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether anything could be done toincrease the production of Lancasters in North America.SIR RICHARD FAIREY suggested that the eventual total output of100 Lancasters per month would be of considerable achievement on the part ofCanada with its limited facilities.MR. R. BRAND said that he hoped that the United Kingdom would obtainall the food supplies they require from the United States in 1943 and 1944. Hewas, however, concerned about the situation which might arise in connexion withdemands for food-stuffs from liberated territories.THE PRIME MINISTER said that while the United Kingdom should certainly do their utmost to help the liberated territories, there were limits beyond which the United Kingdom population could not be expected to go. It wouldnot be possible to ask the United Kingdom population to continue to accept forthe benefit of the liberated territories a disproportionate reduction in its normallevel of subsistence. The United Kingdom as a food importer must go very care-fully in this matter.[26182] b 2
SIR OWEN DIXON said that the operations on the East side of Lae where two brigades of the 9th Division were engaged were going well. The japanese were thought to have some 12,000 troops at Lae and Salamaua. These opera-tions were imposing a considerable burden on the Australian ground troops butthe Japanese seemed to be doing badly in the air and to be weaker in that respectthan were the Australians and Americans.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that he might send a personal message to the 9th Division (a suggestion which Sir Owen Dixon welcomed). Lie studthat as a result of the Italian developments, the whole balance of sea power had altered to the detriment of the Axis. He thought this must have a very disturb-ing effect on the Japanese. He wished that it had been possible for UnitedKingdom troops to have had some part in the present operations in the Pacific.Later on, however, they would be able to participate.SIR OWEN DIXON assured the Prime Minister that the Australian people would be only too glad to see the United Kingdom troops taking a larger partin the operations in the Pacific.MR. PEARSON referred to the discussions which had recently taken place between the Canadian and United Kingdom Governments on the subject of post-war civil aviation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he felt the United Kingdom and dominion Governments must maintain the principle of being able to discuss matters such as this among themselves at a family meeting. There was noquestion of the United Kingdom and the Dominions trying to get together asagainst the Americans. On the contrary, the object was to see how the UnitedKingdom and the Dominions could together best help the Americans. 1 i was obvious that the United Kingdom and the Dominions could offer far greaterfacilities collectively than individually, tie thought it essential to maintain this principle of the family meeting, even at the risk (which he himself thoughtnegligible) of offending the Americans. He thought it a mistake to regard thefuture of civil aviation in terms of a competition between the United States andthe United Kingdom. He would be satisfied if the United Kingdom possessedaircraft and facilities sufficient for its own needs. He envisaged three types of civil air lines in post-war times a world net work in which everyone couldfly; local networks; and a third type of special lines to outlying places wherethe service would be of no commercial value. He did not anticipate that theUnited States would object to British aircraft carrying passengers to places inthe United States ancl perhaps even picking up passengers there of british nationality.   He was in favour of operation by private companies.MR. COX said that the recently instituted leave scheme for New Zealandtroops from the Mediterranean area had been a success and that the greatmajority of men had returned. There had been no difficulty in finding reinforce-ments for the New Zealand Corps.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the New Zealand Corps would proveof great value in future operations.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was in constant touch with Field-Marshal Smuts, who he greatly hoped would shortly visit London.SIR GIRJA BAJPAI said that as a result of recent developments, india was the source of much less controversy and irritation in the United States than had been the case eighteen months ago: He asked whether any military opera-tions as regards Burma were in view. He thought that such operations wouldhave a stabilising effect on Indian opinion.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to Lord Louis Mountbatteirs appoint-ment and said it was the intention to apply the greatest possible force to japan and to do the utmost in spite of the great physical difficulties of invading Burma,to re-establish contact with China. Fie hoped that 1944 would see importantfighting in the South-East Asia area.MR. ARCHER, after apologising for Sir Clive Baillieu&apos;s absence, said thatthe British Raw Materials Mission were working very smoothly with theirAmerican colleagues. A firm grip had been secured over the raw materialssituation and no developments likely to interfere with war production were to beanticipated. As regards the post-war situation affecting raw materials, thismatter would come up for consideration in the discussions which were about tobe opened with the United States authorities.   The synthetic rubber production
in the United States was going very well and the target figure was likely to bereached.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired as to the position regarding highoctane fuel.AIR MARSHAL SIR WILLIAM WELSH said that supplies of highoctane fuel were very short. Although the Americans were doing their best tohelp we were at present only getting about a quarter of the bids we put forward to replenish our reserves. It was hoped that the position would improve by theend of the year.FIELD-MARSHAL SIR JOHN DILL confirmed the Prime, Ministersremarks about tire improvement in relations between the United States and theUnited Kingdom. There were, however, occasional exceptions and he was not altogether happy about public relations in the military sphere. There was acertain amount of anti-British or excessively pro-American feeling in the camps and among some of the American army officers usually of the rank of Brigadieror Colonel and not among the senior ranks.ADMIRAL SIR PERCY NOBLE said that the attitude of the UnitedStates authorities in regard to naval supplies, the assignment of vessels, &amp;o, wasvery reasonable.   He had no complaints.THE PRIME MINISTER asked about public relations.MR. HAROLD BUTLER said that in consequence of our military successesthere had been a great improvement in American feeling towards us during thelast year. Though there were still some bad spots such as Chicago the swingof opinion had been towards us. There was, however, more possibility of contro-versy over post-war questions. Lend-Lease was a case in point. The true factshad not yet got out to the public. If the President or some other member of theAdministration could make a full public statement, this would greatly helpmatters.GENERAL SIR WALTER VENNING said that as far as the BritishMinistry of Supply Mission wras concerned, the position was good. With one exception, we were getting about 90 per cent, of what we were asking from theUnited States for 1943 and 1944. The exception was trucks where the question as regards heavy vehicles was difficult.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out the necessity of combing out our requirements and of bearing in mind that certain supplies previously much in demand might no longer be needed. For example desert warfare was nowprobably over.MR. BRACKEN said that British military successes had cleared the way for the British Information Services which was doing a good job.&apos; MR. MACLAY said that the British Merchant Shipping Mission met withadmirable co-operation from their United States colleagues. Their chief problem at the moment was that of troopshij^s.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the ships to be obtained from italy should help appreciably in this connection.PROFESSOR ROBERTSON referred to the untimely death ofSir Frederick Phillips, the Head of the Treasury Delegation, and said that therewere still certain matters such as the size of the United Kingdom balances outstanding with the United Kingdom Treasury. It was hoped, however, thatthey would be disposed of before long.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed his great regret at Sir F. Philfips&apos;sdeath.MR. BOWES LYON said that the P.W.E. Mission had achieved considerable success in co-ordinating decisions with the Americans on what should be said tothe enemy. There was, however, a tendency in the United States to give Germanytoo soft a peace : this wanted watching.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that we should be careful not to tendtoo much towards &quot; Vansittartism.&quot; Our aim should be to eliminate the two main evils, Prussian militarism and Nazi tyranny. We should concentrate ontnese as the two chief targets and hope by so doing to divide the German people.
MR. BEN SMITH said he had just completed a tour across the United Statesand Canada in the course of which he had visited some 20 factories. At somefactories, the United States tooling and output was much in advance of theUnited Kingdom. Labour was, however, scarce and uncontrolled and in some areas there &quot;was competition between the shipyard workers and the lowerpaidaircraft workers. The turnover of labour was high. He had just seen Mr. Greenof the A.F.L. who was anxious to see the introduction into the United States of something like the British system for controlling labour. Mr. Green had also saidthat he was prepared to discuss the increase in working hours in the UnitedStates, though he had been disturbed by reports brought back by certain Americanvisitors to the United Kingdom of the fatigue of the British workers clue to longhours.MR. NOEL HALL said that the European neutrals were now behavingbetter from the M.E.W. and blockade point of view. Co-operation with theUnited States officials was good. It was to be expected, however, that the usualwinter agitation in the United States in favour of sending food through theblockade to certain European countries would start again soon. In this connection the recent statement in the House of Commons by Mr. Foot regarding the Germangovernment s attitude to Mr. Hoover&apos;s proposals had been very useful.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the responsibility for feeding the populations of the occupied countries was Hitler&apos;s and we should do nothing to relieve him of it. Once we began to allow food through the blockade, there wouldbe no end to it.   The M.E.W. should harden its heart ancl remain adamant.MR, MAGOWAN said that the overseas trade of the United Kingdom andthe United States had been subordinated to the war effort. Cases where rivalriesmight arise were largely dealt with by combined action. The position might soonarise where there would be a greater production of civilian goods. This wouldalso be dealt with by combined planning. Questions affecting the post-war tradeposition were shortly to be taken up with the United States government.MR, MELVILLE said that the British Colonies Supply Mission were closely concerned with the working of the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission. this had provided a very useful meeting ground for British ancl Americans ancl hadhelped to give the latter a rather better knowledge of the problems of colonial government in general and of the Caribbean Islands in particular.Washington. DC., 11th September, 1943.
