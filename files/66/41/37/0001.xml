(43) 437.Qth October, 1943.WAR CABINET.DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS GOODS AND FACTORIES.Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio.I attach a report prepared by a Sub-Committee, representing the Depart-ments principally concerned, on the disposal of surplus (1) raw materials,(2) consumer goods, (3) machinery and machine tools, (4) factories and storagepremises.The Reconstruction Problems Committee have approved^ this Report,subject to certain requirements on the part of Departments represented at themeeting of the Committee and recorded in the minutes, and have asked me tosubmit it to the War Cabinet.2. Except as regards raw materials, which are dealt with in paragraphs and 8 of the report, the recommendations are set out in italics under the variousheads. It will be seen that they are concerned in the main with the machinery and procedure of disposal.3. As regards raw materials, the report presupposes that in the post-armistice period it will be necessary for most of the raw material controls toretain their functions to a considerable extent, and it is recommended that any surplus goods of the kinds dealt with by the controls should be handed over to the controls for disposal as part of their general stock in accordance with allocationsby the Materials Committee, or whatever body may succeed to its functions.4. In regard to consumer goods, the basis of the recommendations is that each class of surplus consumer goods should be disposed of through the agency ofthe Department mainly concerned with their supply. The discussions recom-mencled in paragraph 21 (c) between the Board of Trade and the appropriate department on the one hand and the manufacturing and distributing trades concerned on the other will be important, not only from the point of view of theactual formulation of plans for the disposal of each class of goods, but also becausethey should tend to reassure industry that the Government mean to avoidunregulated disposals similar to those after the last war.The Interdepartmental Committee recommended in paragraph 21 (d) toexercise general supervision over the plans drawn up by the responsible Depart-ments and the Board of Trade would be established at an early date.5. The recommendations in regard to machinery and machine tools (para-graph 25) call for no special comment.6. As is pointed out in paragraph 31, important issues of policy will arise in determining the post-war use of Government factories; the enquiries recom-mended in the report are intended to provide the background against which these issues can be considered and decided at a later date.7. Subject to the approval of the War Cabinet, it is proposed that a public statement should be made by the President of the Board of Trade in regard tothe proposals.W. A. J.m October, 1943.* R.P.

I.E.P. (43) 40.llth September, 1943.WAR  CABINET.Official Committee on Post-War Internal Economic Problems.REPORT ON DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS GOODS AND FACTORIES.WE append a report prepared by a Sub-Committee, representing the Depart-ments principally concerned, on the disposal of surplus (i) raw materials,(ii) consumer goods.(iii) machinery and machine tools.(iv) factories and storage premises.This report has been considered by the full Committee, and after minoradjustment is now submitted with their complete approval.Signed on behalf of the Committee :A. W. HURST, Chairman.4 Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,llth September, 1943.DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS RAW MATERIALS. MANUFACTUREDGOODS AND MACHINERY, FACTORIES AND STORAGE PREMISES.1. At a meeting on the 9th April the Official Committee on Post-WarInternal Economic Problems asked this Sub-Committee for an early interimreport on the disposal of Government assets. We have assumed that this requesthas reference to assets of a kind that are dealt with by the Trade and supply departments, and have confined our enquiry to such assets. Disposal of hospitals,hostels, housing estates, &amp;c, will, we have assumed, be dealt, with by other bodies.The time at our disposal has enabled us to come to some preliminary conclusions on the subject generally, but this note shows that many aspects of the problemrequire further consideration.I.-SURPLUS GOODS.2. Our consideration of the problems of disposal has been based on thefundamental principle which the President of the Board of Trade announced asfollows in the House of Commons on the 3rd February, 1943 : &quot; I suggest thatthis time we must neither drive nor be driven by short-sighted interests intogetting rid as quickly as possible by sales at any price to whoever will come forward to bid for these large stocks, which will be greater than last time, whichwill have been accumulated of goods desirable and necessary for post-war purposes. We must, on this occasion, have an orderly disposal which will haveregard on the one hand to the interests of consumers. We must not allowprofiteering at the expense of consumers, particularly in consumers&apos; goods. Onthe other hand, regard must be had to the interests of producers in the proper timeof these disposals in regard to stocks and current production.&quot;3. The volume of goods for immediate disposal will be smaller if the warcontinues against Japan after the defeat of Germany than it would be if germany and Japan were simultaneously defeated. It is not possible, however,to form any idea of the extent of the difference until some indication is available
of the probable magnitude of the continued requirements of the Service Depart-ments during the interim period of a two-stage ending of the war. We have,therefore, not attempted in this Report to distinguish at all clearly the differentaspects of the disposals problem on the two hypotheses.4. The problem of disposal will, in our view, be most urgent for stocks of consumer goods and raw materials. The use that is to be made of the manyfactories and plants, and of the machinery and other assets of a capital naturepresents many problems which, though of still greater importance, are of lessimmediate urgency.5.   From the point of view of this Report, the primary categories into which(    manufactured goods fall are : (a) Goods for which there is likely to be a civilian use either in the condition in which the goods are declared surplus or after the goods have under-gone some repair or slight modification.(b) Other goods, Le., those for which there is likely to be no civilian use intheir existing form.Category (b) will include munitions stores in the strict sense of the word, e.g.,o-uns, ammunition and fighting vehicles, surrendered by Service Departments. Itwill also include other stores, e.g., lorries which, although normally capable of civilian use. are so worn as to be beyond repair. Category (&amp;) goods will have tobe broken down under arrangements made by either the Service Departments orthe Supply Ministries. While a very large amount of work is likely to be involved, this Committee is not directly concerned with the arrangements to bemade for it. The breaking-down process will produce both scrap, i.e., rawmaterial and, in some cases, goods, e.g., motor vehicle parts, which are capableof civilian use. These products fall into category (a) above, and shouldconsequently be disposed of by the same methods as are employed for the various types of goods in this category. The present Report is confined to the disposal of category (a) goods.6. Large quantities of surplus goods of varied special and mixed categorieswill be thrown up for disposal which will not be capable of classification undercategories (a) and (b) until they have been sorted and examined. Further, in somecases, information may not be readily available as to whether certain articles ofService equipment have a civilian use, and possible civilian uses may only emergewhen the goods are offered for sale.(i) Stocks of Raw Materials and other Goods used in the Process of Production.7. The simplest case of disposal is presented by materials dealt with by the raw Material Controls. Many of the Controls are the sole importers of the materials with which they deal, and have a monopoly in dealings in some of these -manufactured goods made from those materials. In the post-armisticeperiod it will be necessary for most of the Controls to retain their functions to aconsiderable extent, and any goods of the kind the Controls deal in. which may be.declared surplus by any Government agency, could be handed over to the control for disposal as part of its general stock in accordance with allocations by the materials Committee or whatever body may succeed to its functions.8. Similar considerations apply to surpluses of certain manufactured goodssuch as, for example, ball bearings, which form part of the working capital of manufacturers. In cases where the Supply Departments are operating a closecontrol over the distribution of such products, we propose that surpluses should go into the general stock. In other cases the methods which we suggest below forconsumption goods would be appropriate. The Departments concerned should,we propose, agree with the Board of Trade the method most appropriate for eachproduct.(ii) Stocks of Consumers Goods.Ascertainment of Stocks.9. At the end of the war with Germany, whether or not the war against Japancontinues, we can expect that the Service and Supply Departments may be able to release some part of their stocks of. goods capable of civilian use, and that therewill be a strong demand for such goods not only for civilian use in the UnitedKingdom, but from the liberated territories in Europe. It is, however, very[26065] n 2
unlikely that the stocks in the hands of the Ministry of Food will become surplus in the ordinary sense of the word. Obviously the aim should be to use surplus war goods to meet this immediate peacetime demand. By so doing- the best usewill be made of the goods in the national interest and in the consumers interest,and the public at that time Aviil be more disposed to accept unusual patterns thanit will be when the normal (low of civilian goods has been resumed. Moreover,by bringing the goods into use before civil industry is ready to meet alldemands on it. the least damage will be done to the re-establishment of normalt rade.10. In some classes of goods there may be surpluses of such magnitude that,unless their disposal is carefully regulated, serious damage may be caused to theindustries responsible for producing the goods in peacetime. In such casesregard should be paid so far as possible, in the matter of the rate and method of release, to the interests of industry and employment.It.   We therefore recommend that :  (a) Supply Departments and other stockholding Departments other than theService Departments should prepare lists of their main types of (goods which are capable of civilian use, and of wliieh surpluses may become available at an armistice; and(b) Service dud other stockholding Departments should make preparations to declare the maximum quantities of such goods as surplus as soonas an armistice occurs, even at the risk that some replacement may hi&apos;necessary if conditions change.Methods of Disposal of Consumption Goods.12. At the end of the last war the disposal of nearly all goods held by theGovernment was entrusted to a Disposals Board, which was created for thatpurpose by a fusion of the War Office Contracts Department and the Ministryof Munitions, and had no part in operations during the war. In the present warthe Supply Departments and the Board of Trade have exercised a closer controlof industry than in the last war, and in doing so have created a range of specialistDepartments which, are skilled in the operations of the trades which they controland in the case of some Departments are largely staffed from those trades.Though some relaxation of these controls may be possible when the war ends, itis not expected that it will be found desirable to remove them altogether. Manyof them will be necessary to ensure the continuance into the post-war period ofthe policy of stabilising prices, and to ensure that the materials and manufac-turing capacity that are available are used for the more essential purposes.13. Some experience in regard to the disposal of manufactured goods hasalready been obtained from the scheme for the sale to the civilian population of surplus battledress. The procedure in this case is for the Ministry of supply to undertake the sorting and reconditioning of the clothing: to inform the Boardof Trade of the quantities becoming available; and to dispose of the reconditionedclothing to wholesalers nominated by the Board of Trade. The Board of Trade,in consultation with the Ministry of Supply, decides :  (a) The specifications to which the clothes are to be reconditioned;(//) The arrangements as to the number and type of distributors to handle the goods; and(c) The distributors&apos; margins, the retail price and the coupon cost to theconsumer.14. A non-profit-making company has been formed, consisting of second-hand clothing wholesalers who were in the trade before the war, and the Boardof Trade have reserved the right to require the admission of other traders tothe company (in certain circumstances it might be necessary to consider theextension of distribution to include new entrants to the trade) and to nominatedirectors to the Board of the company. The price to the wholesaler and thewholesalers&apos; and retailers&apos; margins, the retail price and the coupon values are allfixed in Board of Trade Orders, and the Board of Trade give the company general directions as to the types of people to whom, or the areas in which, the goods areto be sold.15. The post-war disposal of furniture, on which discussions have already begun between the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Works, is another casein which it is probable that somewhat similar arrangements will be possible.
The proposal is that the Ministry of Works should handle surplus Governmentfurniture, consulting the Board of Trade so as to relate prices with thoseauthorised for utility furniture, and, in particular, so as to bring such furnitureunder-the Board of Trade permit scheme for priority classes (bombed persons,newly-weds, returned soldiers, &amp;c). The two Departments are about to begindiscussions with the furniture trade regarding the terms on which the furnitureshall be repaired and the details of disposals through wholesale and retailchannels. (These arrangements were approved by the Lord Presidents Committeein principle, subject to being related at a later stage to the wider issue of thedisposal of surplus stocks generally, which is being considered by this Sub-Committee-L.P. (43)30th Meeting, Concl. 3 (6-)).16. Both these examples illustrate some principles that seem to us important.The clothing and furniture is being collected from the Departments which havethem for disposal, and is being held, repaired and sold by the Department whichin wartime has been the chief supplier of the goods. The terms and method of sale are settled in consultation with the Board of Trade and are made to fit in with the Board of Trade&apos;s price and rationing policy. The method of disposalis also the subject of discussion with the manufacturing and distributing trades concerned, in order to make the disposal policy fit in so far as may be with normal trade.17. These examples might well be taken as the normal pattern for thedisposal of surplus stocks of manufactured consumer goods, exicept where specialcircumstances justify some departure from it. Surpluses from all departments of any class of goods could be handed over to the Production Department whichhas been mainly concerned with the supply of the goods. Where more than one department have bought similar articles, one Department only should act asthe operating Department for disposals. The operating Department would consult the Board of Trade and other Departments concerned as to the rate and method of disposal of the goods, and the way in which disposal is to be fitted in with any scheme for rationing or for limitation of supplies that might then bein force. The Treasury and the Board of Trade would be consulted regardingprice of sale.18. While the procedure indicated above should be followed wherever possible, it will no doubt be the case that there will be stocks of articles of anondescript character to which these methods of disposal could hardly be applied.Tor such products, the owning Department should consult the Board of trade on whether or not they can and should be fitted into an existing distributionscheme, or whether it is necessary to consult industries producing competingarticles, and on whether sale prices should be controlled. If the Board of trade has no proposals to make on these points the owning Department should then be free to dispose of the goods at the best price obtainable.19.   Under this proposal a number of Departments will be concerned withdisposal of surplus stocks, and co-ordination of policy between them will bedesirable.   This could be achieved through an interdepartmental Committee onwhich were represented the Treasury, the Board of Trade and each of theDepartments acting as operating agencies for disposal, such as the supply departments and the Ministry of Works.  Other Departments would be added forthe consideration of problems with which they were particularly concerned,such as the Ministry for War Transport in regard to the disposal of motor vehicles, or the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for scotland in regard to medical supplies.    This Committee would  deal with general principles only; in each case continuous contact would be necessary between the operating Department and the Board of Trade to ensure that disposal wasco-ordinated with any changes in policy with regard to civilian industry andtrade.-   This Committee could also serve as the body to which Departmentsrequiring surpluses for purposes other than sale to the home public, e.g., theRelief Department, the Colonial Office or the Board of Education, could submit their requirements for transmission to the Departments responsible for organising the disposal of the goods included in them.20. It is believed that in this way the disposal of surplus stocks of consumer goods could be carried through without great disturbance to the recovery of civilian industry and with advantage to the Exchequer. Although stocks to be disposed of may be large, immediately after the war the home demand for manyclasses of goods will be heavy, and it may be necessary to send a substantial-part[26065] b 3
of them for relief and rehabilitation in countries now occupied by the enemy. &quot;Forthese among other reasons we do not foresee the necessity or desirability of disposing of the goods at excessively low prices. Some deduction from normal trade prices may be found necessary to help to overcome prejudices againstunusual types and patterns, and there will be special difficulties in the case of second-hand goods such as furniture, prices of which have been peculiarly difficultto control during the war.21.   We recommend, therefore, that (a) further plans should proceed on the basis that disposal of each class of surplus consumer goods shall, where possible, be made in accordancewith the procedure described in paragraph 17 through the agency ofthe Department mainly concerned with their supply;(b) the Department which will act as operating agency should, so far as is. necessary, make plans to provide the staffs to deal xoith these duties;(c) the Board of Trade and the appropriate operating Department shouldbe authorised to enter into discussions with the manufacturing and distributing trades concerned, for the purpose of formulating plans for the sale (if necessary after repair or reconditioning) of each classof goods;(d) the interdepartmental Committee referred to in paragraph 19 shouldbe set up to exercise a gen end. supervision of the plans for disposalwhich are drawn up by the operating Departments in conjunction withthe Board of Trade.(iii) Machinery and Machine Tools.22. There will be at the end of the war considerable stocks of miscellaneousplant, such as excavating and road-making plant, cranes and locomotives, forwhich arrangements for disposal might be made on the basis suggested in thepreceding paragraphs for consumer goods. Machine tools will, however, providea problem of special difficulty. It is estimated that at the end of the war theGovernment will possess some 200,000 machine tools which will have cost theGovernment  150 million. Some proportion of these will be specialised toolsuseful only for making munitions. But a large number will be machines of a kindnormally used in civilian industry. They will be good modern machines, while agreat part of civilian industry is equipped with old. obsolete or at least obsolescentmachines.23. It appears to us clear that the aim must be to ensure that civilianindustry should be re-equipped with the machine tools that will be surplus to theGovernments needs at the end of the war. On the other hand, in view of thelarge quantities involved, the reaction of such disposal on the machine toolindustry will obviously require careful consideration.24. The problem of disposal of machine tools will therefore be one of con-siderable difficulty and will be inseparable from plans for the future of the machine tool industry and of the engineering industry generally. We propose to give thematter further consideration, but in the meantime suggest that the information regarding the extent of the problem should be made as complete as possible.25    We recommend that (a) The arrangements proposed for disposal of consumable stores shotdd alsobe applied to engineers&apos; plant such as excavators, cranes andlocomotives.(b) A list should be prepared of the approximate numbers of the main types of machine tools owned by the Government, classified, (as soon us thereis a sufficient indication of the. post-armistice requirements of theServices to enable this to be done) into those which ivill probably berequired for Government needs at the end of the tear and those whichivill be surplus and will be suitable for civil industry.ii.-surplus factories.26. The number of factories now owned by the Government is very consider-able, and a proportion of them are of great size. Some consist in effect ofextensions which can only effectively be used in connection with the factories to
which they are attached. The task of utilisation will be formidable; in the caseof larger units it may involve consideration of general questions affecting the location of industry and the willingness of privately-owned undertakings tomigrate from one part of the country to another, especially where the Govern-ment factory is sufficient for the full scope of business envisaged by a private firm.It is likely that, if the Government decided to dispose fairly quickly of all ormost of its factories, difficulty would be encountered in finding willing buyers forall. Industrial firms generally will probably wish to know more of the prospects of post-war trade before acquiring new capacity. This might lead in turn tothe possibility of the Government having to consider in certain cases continuing to provide for their running if reasons of location, provision of employment orensuring necessary materials for post-war industry made it desirable.27. These considerations emerge with special force in the case of Govern-ment factories and plant in the basic industries. Here normally factory and plantare inseparable, the former being a shell built round the latter, which is almostimmovable. The products of these factories are in most cases needed in industryboth in peace and war, hut in some cases demand is greater in war than it will bein peace; as the Government plants are newer they are likely to be among the more efficient in the industry, and their disposal therefore necessarily involves thegeneral plan of reorganisation in the particular industry to which they belong.On the other hand, certain Government plants of this nature have been builtduring the war. which may prove uneconomic in face of international competition in peace, so that private enterprise will show itself unwilling to take them over.It may be desirable in the national interest that these plants should continue to run. whether for reasons of security or to secure employment and industrialdevelopment in potentially depressed areas.28. The Government have also built considerable numbers of small premiseswhich could be converted for use as factories. They are mainly suitable only assmall factories, but are frequently unsuitably located as productive units. Thedisposal of these small premises should, in our view, be governed by the same principles and machinery as we suggest below. In areas where there are not sufficient new factory buildings available for the desired industrial development,special consideration will have to be given to the possibility of their use for production, even though there may be a storage requirement by the owningDepartment.29. One-matter which will arise immediately at the end of the war is thedisposal of factories from which the plant can readily be removed if necessary.The possible post-armistice industrial uses of such factories fall under four main headings:  (a) For continued munitions production, or as reserve capacity.(b) For continued production in the industry for which they were built.(c) For storage.(d) For housing civilian industry for which they w-ere not specially built.(We have learned during the war that most civilian factories can be adapted for use for the production of various kinds of munitions, andno doubt many of the Government factories, if cleared of their plant and machineiy. could be used for civilian production.)Besides having regard!, in the disposal of Government factories, to the above list of possible claimants, it will be necessary also, when considering the choice of factories to run (either for munitions or other production) or to be used for storageor for other purposes, to have regard to the requirements of a proper location ofindustry and to the need to retain factories on production so far as possible in areas where labour is available and the work most needed. This subject will receive further consideration in our report on the termination of war contracts.30.. It is obviously necessary to have as definite information as possible onthe following points, namely (a) The number, type and location of Government factories, together withan indication whether the Supply Departments wish to retain them onthe work for which they were built.Until the Service Departments are in a position to make fairlyfirm and detailed estimates of these post-armistice requirements, theSupply Departments will have difficulty in indicating which factoriesthey are likely to be able to release. The Supply Departments are preparing descriptive surveys of each main type of war production,designedto show in general terms the probable degree of redundancy
after the war and to indicate possible alternative uses for the factories.They have also prepared lists of Government-owned factories,including Royal Ordnance Factories, and of factories operated onagency and on Commercial terms (the Ministry of Supply, who have notyet completed their lists of the last of these categories, propose toinclude all Government-owned extensions or additions to contractors&apos;factories). The Admiralty have supplied lists of the factories theyown, but expect to have very few for disposal and some of these onlyin remote areas. These lists include particulars of floor space, andspecify the services.laid on and the general type of product now-made there, but they are not in their present form sufficiently detailedor complete to enable the allocating body to work on them after the warin assisting the allocation of these factories for civilian industry. Atsome time further details will be required, at any rate in respect of factories which are likely to become available for other civilian use.(b) The commitments, legal or moral, already entered into with the presentoccupiers and the period during which options to purchase or rightsof first refusal can be exercised by the occupier.The Supply Departments are examining this question,(f) The extent to which there is likely to be a demand for the acquisition ofGovernment factories for other industrial uses in peacetime.Industries are being asked, in the course of the approaches whichare now being made to them on post-armistice problems, whether theywould like to make use of any Government factories, and the Boardof Trade are compiling a register of enquiries from firms desiring toacquire Government factories after the war. In addition, with a viewto arriving at some post-war estimate of the relative needs for production in various areas of the country, having regard to the labour available, the Board of Trade have arranged for their RegionalControllers of Factory and Storage premises to collect particulars of the probable employment likely to be offered by industry after thewar in areas which, in the absence of special action, would be likelyto become depressed. We have discussed the form which suchenquiries could most usefully take and have arranged for the central and Regional Offices of the Departments concerned to help the Boardof Trade with these enquiries.(d) The probable demands for temporary storage space in the immediate post-armistice period.During the war full use for war purposes has been made, throughthe Factory and Storage Premises Control, of civilian factories whichwere not engaged on essential production. Between April 1941, whenthe Factory and Storage Premises Control was set up, and the presenttime. 90 million square feet of civilian factory space has been taken over in this way for storage and 40 million square feet for production.A considerable amount of space was taken before April 1941, anddetails are now being compiled. In addition, large numbers of civilianfactories have themselves turned over to war production, in some casesmoving out their own machinery and putting in machine tools (mainlyGovernment-owned) for the production of munitions. One of the mainpriorities in the immediate post-armistice period wull be to get someor all of these civilian factories cleared of war machinery and stores inorder to enable them to turn over to civilian production as quickly aspossible.From the preliminary talks which the Controller-General of Factory and storage Premises has had with Departments, he does not see any prospect atpresent of obtaining more than 6-8 million square feet of additional storage spacefrom the release by Supply Departments of Government-owned factories. This is largely due to the fact that the Service Departments&apos; stocks of munitions will herunning at a high level at the end of the war. As soon as even partial demobilisa-tion takes place, a proportion of these stocks will be returned from unit holding,especially in the case of units brought home from abroad to central depots. Thiswill lead to pressure on the storage accommodation of the Services and may render it difficult or impossible for the Service Departments to accept further deliveries ofmunitions. To the extent that this occurs, the Supply Departments may have toundertake some storage of finished munitions.
The Factory and Storage Premises Control are collecting details of allcivilian factory space now being used for production and for storage purposes,and whilst it is impossible to give dependable figures (calculations must be subjectto military operations and policy in regard to scrapping ancl disposals) it wouldseem that, if the war ended now, at least 30 million square feet of additionalspace would be required after allowing for the space that Departments would findin their Government-owned premises.If any substantial part of this 30 million square feet is to be made availableso that the civilian factories can be cleared quickly, then Departments must make available to the Factory and Storage Premises Control as many large units aspossible to cover the interim period.31. All these enquiries are intended to collect facts as a result of which our post-war industrial needs can be arranged in order of importance, and toprovide a background against which it will be possible to consider what is thebest use to which Government factories can be put in the, national interest. we recognise that it will be desirable, where possible, to reach decisions before theend of the war on the probable future of as many factories as possible, in orderto facilitate the work of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning and theMinistry of Health and the Scottish Office, as well as the Departments represented on this Sub-Committee, but this will probably not be possible in many cases ancl,at the present stage, at any rate, we cannot do more than indicate the machinery which we think appropriate. The disposal or retention of these factories willhave important consequences for employment policy, for the location of industryand for the use of land. It is essential that the machinery should be such as toensure that the fullest account is taken of these considerations.32. The Ministry of Works point out that the sale of Government factories and stores is part of a much larger disposal problem : there are many other buildings, such as hospitals, hostels, offices, camp buildings and huts which willbe surplus. Some Government factories have been built on requisitioned landancl their sites will have to be acquired compulsorily; others have been erected in contravention of local bye-laws and of town ancl country planning schemes, andit is unlikely that these will sell early, if indeed they can be sold at all. Thereare many factors making for delay in disposal, as the experience after the last war showed, and this in turn will raise a management problem; buildings willhave to lie let on lease, rents collected ancl paid, structures and roads maintained,ancl common services, such as water and electricity, administered in the interestsof the tenants. It would obviously be extravagant if each Government Depart-mcnt owning factories had to maintain a technical staff not only for disposal butalso for management. This would lead to an unnecessary multiplication of staffsat a time when professional men are much in demand. Such a proposal wouldbe difficult to defend against the prevailing trend of public opinion, which is all in favour of getting clearance from one authority.33. The Ministry of Works is examining with other interested Departmentswhat arrangements can best be made for the actual disposal of buildings nolonger required for Government purposes. If, as a result of this examination,machinery is set up to deal with surplus buildings, its relationship to the disposalof factories and stores will obviously have to be considered. The immediate problem is to decide which factories should be retained to meet post-war require-ments and which should be earmarked as storage so as to release the civilianfactories for their normal peacetime production. Equally it is important that information should be prepared of the firms which wish to acquire government factories so that these can be placed in early touch with the owning Departments.The disposal of Government-owned factories will inevitably have to be considered in conjunction with the release of requisitioned civilian factories, ancl should notbe complicated or delayed by the introduction&apos; of more interdepartmentalconsultation than is strictly necessary. The whole process will be the converseof that which has been handled by the Factory ancl Storage Premises Controland the Supply Departments during the war, namely the process of acquiringaccommodation for war production, ancl we consider that it should be dealt withas far as possible by the same machinery as has dealt with the converse problemduring the war. We therefore suggest that the Factory and Storage PremisesControl should deal with the work of co-ordinating the use of government factories not pledged to their present occupiers and not required for the purposetor which they were built. In consultation with interested Departments, theControl would allocate available factories either for Government storage or for
disposal, and would also prepare lists of potential buyers so that, when once aGovernment factory has been declared surplus, the way will be open for theowning Department to initiate negotiations for its sale. If the factory cannotbe disposed of for industrial purposes or if its disposal for industrial purposeswould involve management problems before or after disposal, the premises shouldbe handed over to be dealt with by whatever machinery is designated for the saleof surplus buildings generally. In such cases, in considering industrial uses forthese premises once they arc available for disposal, this organisation would consult the Control of Factory and Storage Premises.34.   We accordingly recommend that : -(a) The Factory and Storage Premises Control of the Board- of Trade (inconsultation with other interested Departments) should be recognised as the co-ordinating authority for the disposal of Government factoriesnot pledged to their present occupiers and not required for thepurpose for which they were built, and of any storage premisesrequired for production or for other storage purposes; and that forthis purpose the Control should be authorised to collect lists ofredundant Government factories and of storage ^premises and of applicants for such factories or premises.(b) The Department owning any Government factory for which it has nofurther use, or any storage premises, should be authorised, after discussion with other interested Departments and in agreement as tothe purchaser with the Factory and Storage Premises Control, tonegotiate for its disposal for post-war industrial (including storage)uses; for this purpose they should- prepare and supply to the factory and Storage Premises Control lists giving full particulars of space,services ci-c. of all such factories and premises.(c) Factory or storage premises which cannot be disposed of for industrial purposes and premises -whose disposal -would involve managementproblems before or after disposal should be dealt with by whatevermachinery is designated for the sale of surplus buildings generally.III. MATTERS REQUIRING FURTHER CONSIDERATION.35. In concluding this report we should refer to four related points not covered in it : (a) The disposal of goods held abroad raises special problems which we propose to consider and report upon as soon as possible; otherDepartments than those represented on the Sub-Committee areconcerned and will have to be brought into consultation.(b) Some of the surplus stores which will lie available for disposal at theend of the war will have been obtained under Lease-Lend; we havenot considered the special problems involved as the question has beenunder close examination between the Treasury and the Departmentsinterested, and will need to be further reviewed when the time arrivesfor the actual disposal of stores.(c) It will be essential to co-ordinate the disposal of stocks held by theUnited States and other Forces in this country, and of stocks which other countries may wish to send here, with the arrangements we have proposed for the disposal of stocks held by our own &quot;Government,(d) Some of the Government factories and plants have been erected on land which has been requisitioned under the Defence Regulations. Theposition of the Government as owner of such a factory when these regulations expire is not clear, but it is assumed that any necessary legislation will have been passed to ensure full ownership and right ofdisposal to the Government,August 1943.
