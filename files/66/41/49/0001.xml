(43) 272)1th October, 1943WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 214)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 30th September, to0700 7th October,1943[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. U.S. Carrier-borne aircraft have successfully attacked shipping in norwegian waters.Enemy destroyers have been engaged in the Channel.The island of Kos has been invaded by the enemy.U-boats have attacked shipping in the Mediterranean and Arabian Seas.Six U-boats have been sunk, one probably sunk and one probably damaged.Northern Waters.2. The Home Fleet covered a successful attack which was carried out on enemy shipping in the leads near Bodo (south of the Lofoten Islands) early onthe 4th by aircraft from the U.S. carrier Ranger. Nine enemy ships of 3,000 to10.000 tons, including an 8,000-ton tanker, were hit by bombs, and two small ships were damaged by hits or near misses. The covering force included a US.cruiser and five destroyers. There was no fighter opposition to the strike, but three of Ranger&apos;s aircraft were shot down by A.A. fire. It is thought that someof the crews were captured. In the afternoon aircraft from Ranger destroyed two enemy aircraft which were shadowing the Fleet. All II.M. and U.S. shipsreturned safely to port.3. H.M. S/M Seadog reports that during the recent German raid on Spitz-bergen five Norwegians were killed and 20 captured; about 60 escaped into thecountry. Contact was made by Seadog with survivors of the attack. An Alliedbase has now been established.Home Waters.4. On the night of the 3rd H.M. destroyers Limbourne, Wensleydale,Tanatside, Ulster and Grenville, on patrol north of the Brest peninsula, engagedand damaged four or five enemy destroyers. Grenville and Limbourne were hit and the former set on fire. The other destroyers suffered superficial damageduring the action, the casualties totalling two killed and 20 wounded. Ourcoastal batteries during the same night shelled a heavily escorted convoy of four ships bound from Boulogne to Calais, and damaged one or more ships of the escort. Enemy batteries returned our fire, causing slight damage to navalproperty at Dover and Ramsgate.Early on the morning of the 30th our light coastal forces engaged fourR-boats west of Le Touquet and set one of them on fire. Two M.G.Bs. sustainedslight damage and eight casualties, two of which were fatal.A U.S. tank landing craft which had straggled from a convoy was sunk bythe Boulogne coastal batteries on the night of the 1st.B.Y.M.S. 38 shot down a twin-engined aircraft on the morning of the 4thoff Great Yarmouth.On the 14th September, it is now reported, H.M. S/M Upstart sank twoFrench fishing vessels in the prohibited area in the Bay of Biscay.Mediterranean.5. At Naples two M.T. ships were berthed alongside and two personnel ships were discharged on the 4th. Most of the berths.are blocked by sunken ships, butin other respects damage has been less than was expected. Port parties arrivedat Castellamare and Torre Annunziata on the 1st. Demolition was widespreadat both ports. All factories, power-stations and utility services had beensabotaged. By the 3rd, discharge had begun at Torre Annunziata and one ship had berthed alongside. Bad weather in the Salerno area has hindered unloadingover the beaches.6. On the Adriatic coast a feint landing from four infantry landing craftwas successfully carried out on the 4th north-west of Termoli in order to relieveenemy pressure. Early on the 6th, HAL destroyers bombarded targets on thecoast road north of Termoli in support of land operations. Barletta harbour isclear of obstruction and five berths are available alongside. Destroyer patrolshave been maintained in the Strait of Otranto and in Yugoslav waters.
7. A U.S. port party was established at Cagliari on the 30th and an advanced coastal force base is to be set up at Maddalena. During an air raidon Ajaccio on the 30th a tank-landing ship was sunk and the French destroyerLe Fortune was slightly damaged.8. The following attacks have been reported by FI.M. submarines : On the22nd, Uproar sank a naval auxiliary off Elba, and Sibyl probably torpedoed a1,500-ton ship in the Gulf of Genoa. On the following day she sank a 3,000-tonammunition ship, and on the 30th she sank a large armed trawler full of troops.Ultimatum sank a 500-ton supply barge off Toulon.A belated report has been received that the Polish S/M Dzik sank two ships of 3,000 and 7,000 tons in Bastia roads on the 21st September.9. During the week ending the 1st, 5,570 tons were discharged at Tripoli (L) \12,000 tons of cargo, including 2,880 vehicles, were loaded for Sicily and Italy,and 7,130 personnel were embarked. At Benghazi 9,200 tons were discharged,,including 4,750 tons of petrol in bulk.10. No naval opposition could be offered to the enemy sea-borne invasion of Kos on the morning of the 3rd. The bulk of the enemy shipping had sailedwestward by the evening, and on the following morning landing craft and other elements of the enemy convoy were sighted north-west of Paros and Antiparoson a north-westerly course. On the 5th the harbour of the Piraeus was seen tobe unusually full,&quot;and there was considerable loading activity. Three Allieddestroyers had been patrolling on the 1st and 2nd, and on the night of the2nd/3rd had swept the Kaso Strait, but they had been recalled and reachedAlexandria during the afternoon of the 3rd. As soon as the invasion of Koswas reported three of H.M. submarines were ordered to operate in the Kosapproaches, and nine destroyers were sailed from Malta and Taranto to come under the orders of the C.-in-C, Levant. On the 4th, FLM. cruisers AuroraPenelope, Sirius and Dido left Malta for the Levant. On the following days urora and Dido were damaged in collision north-east of Crete, and proceededat reduced speed for Alexandria.On the 7th, HALS. Sirius sank six landing craft, an ammunition ship andan armed trawler off Stampalia.11. The following steps have been taken in respect of the Italian ships at malta :-The crews of the three battleships are to be reduced to 600 men each, andthose of the submarines to one-third of their normal complement. Three Italiancruisers, two destroyers, and six corvettes left Malta for Taranto on the 4thwith the surplus personnel on board. On the following day nine torpedo-boats and three submarines left Malta for Taranto. Six corvettes and 12 torpedo-boats are to be formed forthwith into escort groups. The Italian Navy is alsoto man seven schooners to help in the rescue of Allied prisoners and to assistpartisans.The Duke of Aosta is to be C-in-O, Taranto.Pacific.12. The Japanese fleet remains concentrated in the Carolines, but there hasbeen considerable activity between Rabaul and the Solomons, and escorted convoyshave been reported on a southerly course in the Bismarck Archipelago.New Guinea.13. Allied patrol craft sank three troop-laden barges close inshore north-west of Finschhafen on the 30th. One Allied vessel grounded and was lost, butthe crew were saved.Solomon Islands.14. It was reported on the 4th that Japanese troops were being withdrawnfrom Kolombangara Island in barges to Choiseul Island, there to be transferredto destroyers sent from Rabaul. Allied destroyers engaged in preventing this traffic sank or badly damaged 34 barges between the 27th and the 1st. On the2nd the whole of a convoy of 20 large barges was destroyed, together with anumber of small barges, seven M.T.Bs., and a torpedo-boat.On the 1st, Japanese aircraft bombed shipping off Vella Lavella and set on fire two tank-landing ships.[26216] B
Central Pacific.15. At dawn on the 6th a strong U.S. task force, including an aircraft-carrier, shelled and bombed enemy forces and installations on Wake Island. no details are available.Anti-Submarine Operations.16. Twenty-two attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week,12 by shore-based aircraft, two by carrier-borne aircraft, one by submarine, and seven by surface craft.On the 4th two German U-boats were sunk south-west of Iceland (C) by air-craft, and on the same day aircraft from the U.S.S. Card, (escort carrier) sank two U-boats north of the Azores. On the following day aircraft sank a U-boatsouth of the Denmark Strait. On the 1st a Japanese U-boat was sunk in theGuadalcanal area by the U.S.S. Eaton (destroyer), and on the 9th September a japanese U-boat was probably sunk by the U.S. S/M Trout east of the PhilippineIslands.  On the 27th, a U.S. aircraft probably damaged a U-boat east of Baia.During September, 11 U-boats (including four Japanese) were sunk orprobably sunk, four possibly sunk and 12 damaged.Enemy Intelligence.German.17. Photographic reconnaissance of Altenfiord on the 5th showed theTirpitz in her usual berth. The Scharnhorst was not seen. The Graf Zeppelin,in contradiction of previous reports, was seen at Stettin on the 3rd.U-boats.18. During the week a large group of U-boats has been operating without success in the N.W. Approaches. There has been increased activity in the ArabianSea, and U-boats have been reported off Madras and west of Ceylon.There has been rather more U-boat activity in the Mediterranean, but it isnot considered that any substantial reinforcements have reached Germanbases there.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked seven ships,two of which are known to have sunk. All the attacks took place in theMediterranean and Arabian Seas.A tanker was torpedoed, and another ship was sunk, in a. west-bound convoy off Bone. One ship in an east-bound convoy was torpedoed east of Algiers. a tanker was torpedoed north-east of Benghazi. Two tankers were torpedoed, one at the entrance to the Persian Gulf and the other in the Gulf of Aden. One ship was sunk west of Bombay.One ship was sunk and three others damaged in an attack by 15 HE. Ill onan east-bound convoy west of Algiers. An Italian refrigerator ship was damagedbeyond repair in an air raid on Leros.A home-bound convoy was unsuccessfully attacked by F.W. 200 west of cape Finisterre, and a straggler from an outward-bound convoy wasunsuccessfully attacked south-west of Portugal.One ship was mined and sunk off Bizerta.Protection of Seaborne Trade.20. During the week ending the 3rd, 914 ships were convoyed. Of these231 ships were in ocean convoys and 683 in British coastal convoys. Two cruisers,,one escort carrier, 83 destroyers (including 12 U.S., two Russian and oneFrench), 109 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes (including six U.S. cutters),were employed on escort duties.Three ocean convoys, consisting of 130 ships, arrived in Home waters without loss.[The figures of estimated total imports for periods of ten days shown inAppendix VI have been substituted for the figures of weekly arrivals in ships in convoy previously given in this paragraph.]
British Minelaying.21.   During the week surface craft laid mines off the Belgian coast.Aircraft laid mines in the Baltic, in the Kattegat, off the Frisian Islands, andoff the Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.22.   On two nights during the week enemy aircraft were operating off theS.E. Coast between the Ffumber and the Thames Estuary, probably minelaying.E-boats have again been minelaying off Calais.During the week 11 ground mines have been destroyed off the S.E. Coast, and nine moored mines have been cut in Lyme Bay.Mine totals are : 4,498 ground and 3,343 moored.On the 1st, 36 mines were destroyed in the approaches to Castellamare, sincewhen approach channels have been cleared between Capri and the mainland ofNaples, and between Castellamare and Naples.Between the 8th and 11th September 36 Italian mines were destroyed in the approaches to Salerno during landing operations.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. The German s.s. Scharlachberger (2,844 tons) arrived at Bilbao on the1st to load iron ore.The German (ex-Vichy) tanker Firuz (7,327 tons) sailed from Istanbul forBurgas on the 28th. She had been lying at Istanbul since her arrival onthe 6th August after being torpedoed in the Black Sea,Between the 1st and 15th September 40 enemy ships totalling 113,519 tons,were sunk or captured, all except three ships (6,500 tons) in the Mediterranean.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Velizh-Gomel Sector.24. During the early part of the week the Russians continued to advance-steadily, but German resistance has gradually stiffened and Russian progress inthe last few days has been slow. The most recent change in the line has been in thearea west of Demidov, where the Russians are now 30 miles from Vitebsk. TheGermans are reported to be building defences in this sector.Gomel-Zaporozhe Sector.25. The Russians now hold the east bank of the Dnieper along the wholestretch between Loev and Zaporozhe, and although they themselves have made no claim to have crossed the river at any point, the Germans have frequentlymentioned the existence of small Russian bridge-heads on the west bank, one ofthem being at the junction of the River Pripet and the Dnieper. The germans have reacted strongly against Russian attempts to establish bridge-heads, andthose which do exist are not believed to be either large or very strongly held.Zaporozhe-Melitopol Sector.26. It is now known that the Russians have not cut the railway Zaporozhe-Melitopol at Vassilevka, although the railway is under fire from Russian artillery.The Germans are still resisting strongly, and the Russians have made no further advance.Taman Bridgehead.27. The town of Taman has been taken by the Russians, and the Germansnow hold only a very small area on the tip of the peninsula.Stimmary.28. It is becoming increasingly probable that the Germans intend to hold the line of the Dnieper down to Zaporozhe and to hold their present positionsfrom there to Melitopol.[26216] b 2
Italy.Eighth A rmy.29. After the capture of Foggia on the 27th September, the Eighth Armycontinued to advance rapidly to the west and north-west. By the 1st Octoberarmoured patrols were north-west of Serracapriola and the Canadians had movedup to Lucera. Early on the morning of the 3rd, Commandos landed at Termoliand captured the town. They were quickly reinforced by a brigade advancingup the coast road and by two infantry brigades which had been ferried up thecoast. The Germans reacted strongly to this latest advance of the Eighth Army;they moved a panzer division over from the west and thus further extended their forces opposing the advance of the Allied armies.Fierce fighting has ensued in this area and German attacks on the 5th forceda slight withdrawal of our left flank south of Termoli in order to protect ourartillery positions in the Biferno valley. Deployment of our troops was hampered by the collapse of a river bridge west of Portocannone, due to heavy rains.Further south, on the 6th, the Canadians who were operating on the line ofthe road running north and south of Volturara met strong resistance on their right flank. On their left they are now in touch with the right flank of the FifthArmy north of Benevento.Fifth Army.30. During the past week the Fifth Army have made considerable progress.The ITS. forces have swung round to the north-west, capturing Benevento on the2nd and Maddaloni on the 5th. They are now advancing on a general line six miles to the north-west of these two towns, and on their left have reached the RiverVolturno. The Germans have offered no more than rearguard opposition, relyingmainly on extensive demolitions of bridges and roads to delay our troops.British armoured cars entered Naples on the 1st after the Germans hadevacuated the city. During the following days our armour fought numeroussmall actions with the Germans in the close, urban district north-east of Naples.By the 5th we had reached the line of the Volturno, where it was expected thatthe Germans would make a determined, even though temporary, attempt to holdus. A bridgehead has been secured at Grazzanise and the infantry are now comingup to force a crossing in strength, while at the same time another British infantrycolumn is directed on Capua.Summary.31. The Allied forces are now operating in strength from Termoli on theeast coast, to Pescolamazza in the centre and thence to the north of the Volturnoon the west coast. The whole battle front has thus been completely integrated.The supply problems for a front, half of which is dependent on such distantbases, are naturally formidable, but they are nevertheless being successfullyresolved.So long as the build-up of fighting formations and air force personnel had first priority, the task of supplying them by the &quot; tails&quot; of our two armies in italy was bound to be difficult. But now that General Alexander has assembledand deployed a moi-e evenly balanced force and more ports have been broughtinto operation, the situation should become easier.The Eighth Army, who have had to travel immense distances, are being maintained through Crotone, Taranto and Bari. It is estimated that by the 20ththe eastern ports of South Italy will be developed to handle 10,000 tons a day. JThe Fifth Army have been largely maintained through the Salerno beaches,but already it has been possible to discharge through Naples at the rate of2,000 tons per day. The Germans caused great destruction to the harbour andto the public services in the city before they evacuated, and it is apparent thatas they fall back, on the west coast at any rate, they are determined to destroyas much as they can. The biirning of food stocks and destruction of theaqueduct system must naturally impose an added burden on the Allies, who haveto provide as best they can for the Italian civilian population. Italian officialsare, however, co-operating and conditions, although bad, are not as serious as itwas feared they might be.
Corsica.32. The German bridgehead at Bastia on the 30th September extended15 miles to the north and 15 miles to the south of the town. It was graduallyreduced in size, but the port of Bastia and the airfield at Borgo remained inGerman hands till the 4th October. Three-quarters of the German forces hadbeen evacuated by the 2nd, and after the fall of Bastia German remnants were taken off from the beaches north of the town.French Moroccan troops threatened mountain passes west and south ofBastia for some days, but their forces were never sufficient to interfere with theGerman evacuation. The Goums finally broke through into Bastia on the 4th.German casualties may exceed 2,000.In the final stages French forces numbered 7,000, including an AssaultBattalion, an Infantry Battalion, a Regiment of Tirailleurs, a Groupe of Tabours(Goums), a Mountain Artillery Battery, some Light A.A. and a Light TankSquadron (15 tanks).Eastern Mediterranean.33. Our total garrisons on the British-occupied islands had risen by the1st October to approximately 3,800 all ranks (including R.A.F. and Naval detach-ments). There had been a considerable increase in the strength of the german air Force in the Greece -F^gean area, and the enemy was concentrating his air attacks on the Kos airfields.The garrison on Kos consisted of 3,900 Italians, who had been stationed theresince 1940 and were of low morale, together with 1,600 British troops. The latter had no artillery except 15 Bofors guns affording A.A. protection for Kos townand Lambi landing ground, and 18 Bofors guns protecting Antimachia airfield.The enemy launched a sea and airborne attack at dawn on the 3rd.Parachutists were dropped on Antimachia airfield while seaborne landings were affected at four widely separated points (two on the north coast and two on thesouth), from a convoy of seven landing craft and seven transports, escorted by three destroyers and covering aircraft. Within a few hours, upwards of 2,000German troops were ashore with transport, supporting arms and some tanks. -By the evening of the 3rd, the enemy, who had established local air and navalsupremacy, were in virtual control of the island, except for an area of two milesradius round the town of Kos. The town itself soon became untenable. Althoughthe Italians were sited to cover the beaches where the landings were effected, thereis no evidence that they offered any serious resistance to the enemy.Wireless communication with Kos ceased after the night of the 3rd/4thOctober. The German communique of the 5th claimed that 600 British and2,500 Italian troops had been captured and that final mopping-up was in progress.The last communique from Middle East elated the 6th indicated that guerillaactivity was continuing on the island.Burma.34.   Whilst monsoon conditions still obtain, the weather is slowhy improving.Our patrols have been active on all fronts. On the 29th September one ofour patrols killed, without loss to themselves, all nine of a patrol of enemyirregulars at Mowdok- in Arakan. Our patrols operating in the Chin Hillsengaged without loss a patrol of four Japanese and ten Burmans, killing one andcapturing six Burmans.There has been a slight increase in Japanese patrol activity in Arakan, inthe Chin Hills and along the Burma-Yunnan border. In this border areaJapanese forces, in short advances, have occupied the towns of Langyang andHtawgaw, some 70 miles north-east of Myitkyina, Chinese forces were with-drawn from these two towns.New Guinea.35. Finschhafen was occupied by Australian forces on the 2nd October afterstubborn resistance about half a mile north and west of the town. The bodies of100 Japanese marines were found among enemy dead. All resistance in this area has now ceased. Mopping-up has continued in the Lae area. The Australiansadvancing eastward along the coast from Lae have now reached Cape Cretin,about eight miles south of Finschhafen without having encountered any Japanese.In the Upper Markham Valley further Australian reinforcements were flown into
Kaiapit,. bringing the force in that area up to a strength of two brigades and abattery of field artillery. On the night of the 28th/29th September, a small party of Australian guerillas operating from Bena Bena (50 miles W.N.W. of Kaiapit)against the Japanese lines of communication in the Ramu Valley, swam the RamuRiver and ambushed a party of one hundred Japanese on the track about 16 milesahead of the point then reached by advanced elements of the Australian forceadvancing from Kaiapit. Forty-five Japanese were killed and many wounded..Australian casualties are described as light.The forces advancing up the Markham Valley are later reported to have crossed the divide between the Markham and Ramu Rivers, and captured the villages of Kaigulin and Dumpu, some 60 miles south of Madahg.Solomons.36. On the 22ncl September American reinforcements were landed on VellaLavella. The remaining Japanese troops, estimated at 300, still resisting in thenorth-west of Vella Lavella. are reported to be surrounded.For some time considerable large activity has been observed between Kolom-bangara, Choiseul and Bougainville, the Japanese main base in the NorthernSolomons. On the 5th October a South-West Pacific communique, reporting the sinking of 46 barges off Kolombangara, claimed that these barges were engagedm evacuating the Japanese garrison from that island.The Vila area of Kolombangara Island has now been evacuated by japanese troops.AIR SITUATION.General Review.37. Daylight attacks were made on targets in France, the Low Countries andGerman v. At night, industrial targets at Flagen, Munich. Kassel and Frank-further were heavily bombed.In Italy, enemy communications were attacked. Heavy bombers attackedBologna, Pisa, Wierner Neustadt and airfields near Athens.United Kingdom.3.8. In daylight, no enemy aircraft were reported overland. On three nightsfrom 10 to 15 Me. 410s flew over East Anglia and S.E. England, their operationsbeing obviously intended to coincide with the return of our bombing forces, and anti-personnel bombs were dropped in the neighbourhood of airfields. On the night 6th/7th, nine enemy long-range bombers carried out scattered bombingin the same area.   Two enemy aircraft were destroyed.Home &quot;Waters.39. Aircraft of Fighter Command attacked shipping in Flushing, Boulogneand Fecamp harbours and off the French and Dutch coasts; two cargo ships of .000 tons and 1,200 tons respectively, two coasters and three E/R boats were damaged and several other small craft were either destroyed or damaged. two aircrafts are missing.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 130 were despatched, laid 348sea-mines in enemy waters; one aircraft is missing.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.40. On the 2nd, 337 Fortresses (B. 17) out of 349 despatched, made.a blindbombing attack on the port area at Emclen, dropping 790 tons of bombs. Animmediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 3rd is given inAppendix VII.On the 4th, 322 Fortresses (B. 17) were despatched to attack targets InN.W. Germany; 110 of these dropped 272 tons in the Frankfurt&apos; area (seeAppendix VII), and 159 bombed other targets including saarbrucken and at . Dizier (52 miles&apos; W. of Nancy), dropping 381 tons with poor to good results.During these attacks, 38 Liberators (B. 24) carried out a diversionary sweepover the North Sea.
Night.41.   Aircraft of Bomber Command attacked the following targets : Date.                    Target		Aircraft Despatched.	Attacked Primary Target.	Tonnage of Bombs.

At Frankfurt, the marker bombs wereaccurately placed and well maintained and a concentrated attack developed.Crews operating in the final stages of the attack described the target area asa mass of flames with clouds of black smoke rising as high as 18,000 feet. AtLudwigshafen, the marker bombs were scattered; a built-up area in the south ofthe town received most of the bombing and several good fires were started.Mosquitoes made small-scale attacks on Cologne, Hanover, Aachen, Gelsen-kirchen, Witten and St. Dizier. A total of 66 Intruders attacked airfields andother targets in Northern France and 27 aircraft dropped leaflets on severaltowns in France.Italy and South Germany.42. Roads and bridges north of Naples were the principal targets for ourmedium and fighter-bombers. Heavy bombers attacked railway centres in northern italy.A number of raids on targets to the north of the Volturno River was madeby formations of about 25 medium bombers. A bridge at Mignano was severely damaged and both approaches were cratered; a good concentration of bombs was obtained on the road S.E. of Isernia and the railway bridge was destroyed;the road junction and the railway at Vairano and the coast road at Terracinawere successfully bombed. At night, a total of 160 Wellingtons made four night attacks in the Formia area and obtained direct hits on the road junction with,000-lb. bombs and cut the railway to Naples. Forty-eight Wellingtons bombed the railway centre at Civitavecchia, the target being well covered. Fighter-bombers operated against road movement and communications as far north asIsernia and destroyed or damaged 207 M.T. vehicles, three railroad engines, sixaircraft on the ground and four Ju. 52s in combat. From these operations sixWellingtons, four Mitchells (B. 25) and nine fighter-bombers are missing.A heavy scale of attack was made on roads and bridges in the Beneventoarea. In the vicinity of, or over, the Volturno River, bridges or roads were hit atCastelvenere, Amorosi, Cancello, Capua and Grazzanise. Fighters patrolled the battle area. Allied casualties were six bombers and one Spitfire; four enemy fighters were shot down.During the week, Marauders (B. 26) bombed St. Omer/Longuenesse,Beauvais/Tille, Sehipol, WcensdVceht and&apos;Haamstede airfields, dropping 266 tonswith fair results.Six electric power and switching stations in Northern France were successfully attacked by medium and light bombers, which dropped 69 tons.Typhon bombers attacked the Sinclair Petroleum Works, near Ghent, scoringhits on the refinery plant. Mustangs (P. 51), Typhoons and. Hurricanes attackedtransport and other targets in Northern France. Forty-eight locomotives and twotrains, a transformer station and several barges were damaged and three aircraft were destroyed on the ground.Allied fighters flew 1,982 sorties during the week. Bombers and fighters destroyed 127 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 34 and damaged 48 for the lossof 13 &quot;Fortresses (B. 17). four Liberators (B. 24). four Bostons (A. 20) and 20fm-hter-bombers and fighters.
An attack by 124 Fortresses (B. 17) was made on the railway centre ofBologna, where 368 tons of bombs were released, causing severe damage to rolling-stock, tracks, warehouses and train sheds. Over 160 tons were dropped at therailway centre at Pisa with excellent results, and a similar weight of bombs was dropped at Bolzano.Ninety-two Liberators (B. 24) bombed aircraft assembly works and theHenschel locomotive works at Wiener Neustadt and obtained diiect hits on anumber of buildings. A projected attack by 89 Fortresses (B. 17) on Augsburgwas abandoned because of unfavourable weather conditions en route.Considerable enemy fighter opposition was encountered in the operations against Bolzano. Bologna.&quot; Wiener Neustadt and Augsburg, resulting in thedestruction of 24 enemy fighters and the loss of 18 Allied heavy bombers.Corsica.43. On the 4th, a formation of 25 Mitchells (B. 25) attacked shipping atBastia; a large tanker which was already on fire was bombed, hits were obtained on the quay and near misses on a ship of 300 feet.French Spitfires destroyed seven enemy aircraft, including five transport air-craft and probably destroyed three others.Mediterranean.Dodecanese, Crete and Greece.44. On the 29th, two attacks were made on landing grounds at Antimachiaby 18 and 24 escorted Ju. 88s respectively, as a result of which both landing grounds were rendered unserviceable for a period of several days; an additionalstrip was. however, usable. Similar attacks were made on the two following days and ultimately it was impossible to operate our fighters.The enemy landing operation on the island of Kos on the 3rd was covered byabout 30 Ju. 88s together with about 100 Ju. 87 dive-bombers. Paratroops landed at Antimachia airfield. Not since 1942 has the CAP. enjoyed conditionsenabling; them to stage an undertaking on these dimensions in broad daylight.Leros Island was harassed by other Ju. 88 formations escorted by a few fighters.On the 3rd, Beaufighters new 28 sorties and attacked shipping off Kos and destroyed two Ju. 87s. Five Beaufighters are missing and seven others were damaged by A.A. fire.Allied bombers concentrated on enemy airfields. Argos (27 miles S.W. ofCorinth) was bombed on the night of the 28th/29th, and again on the 4th by47 Mitchells (B. 25), six aircraft on the ground being destroyed. The airfields onRhodes and on Crete were attacked by small formations of Beaufighters and otherbombers. Heavy attacks, each by over 40 Liberators (B. 24), were made on Tatoiand Eleusis airfields near Athens; hangars, runways and administrative buildings were hit and at least 12 enemy aircraft were seen burning on the ground at Tatoi;six enemy aircraft were shot down and three Liberators (B. 24) are missing.Russia.45.

Photographs taken on the 30th September after the attack on the29th-30th shows extremely heavy fresh damage throughout the town and district.Damage to industrial plants is very severe and includes the following factories : Vereinigte Stahlwerke (Bochumer Verein) Werk Gusstahlfabrik Steel-works.   (At least 15 large shops affected (Priority 1 -!-).)Vereinigte Stahlwerke (Bochumer Verein) Werk Stahlindustrie (Priority 1).Vereinigte Stahlwerke (Bochumer Verein) Werk Hontrop (Priority 1).Gelsenkirehener Bergwerk A.G. Carolinengluck Colliery (Priority 1).Krupp Treibstoffwerke G.m.b.H. (Benzin and tar oils) (Priority 1).Eisen- u. Huttenwerke A.G., Steelworks (Priority 1).Bergbau A.G. Lothringen.President Colliery 1/4.Maschinen u. Bahndarf A.G. Machinery.Eahrzeugwerke Leug Lorries.Balcke u. Co.Considerable damage has been caused to railway buildings and. tracks,including a bridge and a locomotive round-house, the town gasworks has been severely damaged and there are several, areas of devastation of business and residential property.[262161 d
Hanover. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on the 27th-28th September shows that damage is concentrated in the north of the city, especially in the Brinker Ha fen district. In this area a Priority 1 -fengineering works and works making electrical equipment, machine tools andcables have all been damaged.&apos;A final interpretation of photographs shows that in the previous attack, in all,56 factories or industrial premises were damaged. An outstanding feature wasthe dislocation caused to railway working. An interpretation from a transportaspect of two sorties flown on the 23rd September shows the dislocation to havebeen extensive. Damage to tracks was particularly severe in the southern area and the line south, through Wulfel to Hilclersheim was closed, not only as a resultthereof, but because of a direct hit on a bridge carrying four tracks, which caused the collapse of the spans carrying two central ones, displaced the western spanand damaged the eastern span. An unusual number of trains was seen at severalvital points. The damage to the carriage sidings east of the main station wassevere. In the first sortie the carriage sheds were seen on fire and in the secondsortie to have been gutted. Apart from those carriages in the sheds, about 50 ofthose outside were seen to have been destroyed by HE. or damaged by fire.Hagen. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the3rd October is rendered difficult by the smoke of fires still burning as a result ofthe attack on the lst-2nd October. Damage to industrial, commercial and residential property is. however, seen to be very severe, and industries damagedinclude Accumulatoren-Fabrik A.G. (Priority 1 -f-). makers of submarinebatteries, accumulators and fire-control apparatus, a group of factories producingaircraft parts and machine tools, foundries, screw works and a textile factory.Railway facilities and public buildings have suffered and there is an area ofdevastation in the more densely built-up town area.Emden. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the3rd October after the U.S.A.A.F. attacks through cloud shows that a largeconcentration of bombs has fallen round the Binner Ha fen causing heavy damage.In this area a considerable number of buildings, including the Hammerwerk. has been destroyed, and dock facilities and dock wall have been extensively damaged.The shipbuilding works of Nordsee Werke (a priority 1 + target) have suffered severely, while one M/V and two floating docks have been sunk. In addition, therailways yards south of the railway docks have received numerous hits whichhave cut tracks and damaged rolling-stock.Kassel. Photographs taken on the 4th October show major damage toSpinnfasser AG. (Priority 1 -Jr) and two Priority 1 factories, FieselerFlugzeugbau and Salzmann and Co. Fourteen other factories have been seriously damaged ancl three large barracks. Many buildings were destroyed and damage was accentuated by the explosion of an ammunition dump. In the town, the eastquarter has suffered and fires were still burning in nearly all areas affected.Munich. Photographs taken on the 3rd October covered only a small partof the city. In these, severe damage could be seen ancl fires still burning testifyto the success of the attack on the previous night.It is known that the former attack fell in and to the south of the city anddetails have now come to hand.Failure of the population to take shelter considerably increased the casualties.Having experienced for some months Mosquito attacks and numerous false alarms,the heavy attack effected complete surprise.In the Isar Valley, damage was heavy. Travelling by train fromAVolfratshausen into the city it could be seen that hardly a place had escapeddamage in some degree. Tracks had been hit and the stations at Pullach, FlohenSchaftlarn and Thalkirchen. At the latter, one heavy bomb had fallen when alarge number of persons was awaiting a train. Damage to the main power station at Thalkirchen and to a sub-station at Pullach were additional factors that causedthis line to be closed completely between Wolfratshausen and Munich forthree days.At Grosse Flesselohe, the station and the bridge carrying the Reichsbahn overthe river were damaged sufficiently to complete stoppage of traffic.In Munich itself, the south station was closed to the public for two days whilerepairs were effected. Parts of the big market hall nearly collapsed from direct hits or blast, and, at the cattle slaughter house, where damage was severe, therefrigeration plant in about 60 per cent, of the storage houses was destroyed orput out of action.
Frankfurt.- An immediate interpretation of photographs taken aboutl  hours after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 4th October is hampered by theflames and smoke of fires blazing in the works of the Vereinigte DeutscheMetalwerke A.G. in the suburb of Heddernheim. These works (Priority 1 4-target) producing bronze and light metal alloys, aircraft wheels, and variable pitchairscrews, have been heavily damaged and many of the shops have suffered severely.There is some damage to property, mainly residential, in Heddernheim and inthe neighbouring suburb of Rschersheim.France.Rheims / Champagne. Photographs taken on the 3rd October, show considerable damage to buildings on the west side of the airfield as a result of theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 26th September. A large hangar has been three-quarters destroyed, a smaller one completely destroyed and several workshops andbarrack buildings wholly or partly destroyed. Four small buildings and the(probable) administration buildings have also suffered severely.BeauvaisITille. Photographs taken on the 3rd October show that, as aresult of the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 24th and 27th September, one coveredshelter has been severely damaged and four stores huts in the bomb andammunition stores have received direct hits. There are also nine craters on therunways, 13 on taxi tracks and a servicing tarmac, and a large number on the landing ground.Evreucc / Fawcille. Photographs   taken   on   the   3rd   October  after   the   .U.S.A.A.F\ attack on the 24th September show that nine small buildings in theS.E. dispersal area and two defence posts close by were severely damaged.   Thereare many new craters on taxi tracks in both the S.W. and S.E. dispersal areas.
