(43) 450.   (Revise.)8th October, 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET.INDIA.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.THE attached Directive to the Viceroy Designate has now been approvedby the War Cabinet.(Initialled) W. S. C.DIRECTIVE TO THE VICEROY DESIGNATE.1. Your first duty is the defence of India from Japanese menace andinvasion. Owing to the favourable turn which the affairs of The King-Emperorhave taken this duty can best be discharged by ensuring that India is a safeand fertile base from which the British and American offensive can be launched in 1944. Peace, order and a high condition of war-time well-being among the masses of the people constitute the essential foundation of the forward thrustagainst the enemy.2. The material and cultural conditions of the many peoples of India will naturally engage your earnest attention. The hard pressures of world-war have for the first time for many years brought conditions of scarcity, verging in somelocalities into actual famine, upon India. Every effort must be made, even by the diversion of shipping urgently needed for war purposes, to deal with local shortages.   But besides this the prevention of the hoarding of grain for a better
market and the fair distribution of foodstuffs between town and country are ofthe utmost consequence. The contrast between wealth and poverty in India, the incidence of corrective taxation and the relations prevailing between land-ownerand tenant or labourer, or between factory-owner and employee, require searchingre-examination.3. Every effort should be made by you to assuage the strife between the hindus and Moslems and to induce them to work together for the common good.No form of democratic Government can flourish in India while so many millionsare by their birth excluded from those fundamental rights of equality betweenman and man. upon which all healthy human societies must stand.4. The mission of His Majesty&apos;s Government in India will best be discharged at this juncture by the defence of its frontiers against the foreignenemy, by the appeasement of communal differences and the rallying of all sections to full support of the Government in the war effort, and by themaintenance of the best possible standard of living for the largest number of people.5. The declarations of His Majesty&apos;s Government in favour of the estab-lishment of a self-governing India as an integral member of the British Empireand Commonwealth of Nations remain our inflexible policy. You will make, as occasion warrants, any proposals which you consider may achieve that end. Youwill not be deterred from making such proposals by the fact that the war is still proceeding; but you will beware above all things lest the achievement of victoryand the ending of the miseries of war should be retarded by undue concentration on political issues while the enemy is at the gate.W. 8. C.8.10.43.10 Downing Street. S.W. 1;8th &quot;October. 1943.
