DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHEIC MA JESOEY&apos; S GOVERNS AT)&apos;CRET^H^C^jO^llj!- 1945 *IfCopy No.JAR CABINET,,POST-EAR AGRICULTURAL POLICY0Memorandum, by t he -.iiniate r of Fgod ,1,    I welcome the restatement &quot;by the Agricultural Ministers inchoir recent paper  (XI. P. (43) 422)   of the broad  objectives of a post-Lar agricultural policy.    In particular, I agree with them that thefirst objective of our agriculture must be to make the maximumContribution to the adequate feeding of the people  of this country,land that British agriculture must produce those essential foods,  suchfcs milk and fresh vegetables, which we cannot obtain in sufficientfc-ucntItios from abroad.2.    I also agree that,  in the period beginning say five years from, nov.&apos;,  &quot;the level of production and the methods by which it mightfcc maintained must largely depend on international, economic andfinancial conditions as they emerge after the war.&quot;    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment has not reached even provisional conclusions on certainrcuostions that arc fundamental to a permanent food and agricultural policy.    Among those questions arc the degree of financial stability[that should be guaranteed to the agricultural industry- the methodstor securing this stability (whether by guaranteed prices orrothorwiso)  and the effect this will have upon prices  of food to theconsumer.    Of great importance also is the question whether the state should continue to purchase,  or to regulate the importation of foodprom abroad and what arrangements should,  or indeed could be made[for the better marketing and distribution of food.    On this last andpeculiarly intractable problem, my Department has nov; been at workIf or many months, and our provisional conclusions are at present under[consideration by the Agricultural Departments.3.    In these circumstances immediate discussions with the farmers[on long term agricultural policy are likely to be both disappointingfto them and embarrassing to His Majesty&apos;s Government.    There are[compelling reasons, however, why the Agricultural Ministers should be[authorised to make at once some new and definite announcement abouttho future of the agricultural Industry.    I suggest that they shouldbe authorised to procoed on tho following lines.4,    The farmers  should be informed in specific terms that theGovernment extends until the end of 1947 the existing guarantee of(financial stability implied in the pledge given in 1940 regarding thepiaintonanco of the present system of guaranteed markets and prices forpio duration of hostilities and for at least one year thereafter.)Such - guarantoc is essential if wo are to obtain the food that weshall require;   indood,  for thse present this is  surely the realproblem on which we have to concentrate in considering post-warPgriculturo.    Provided the farmers are thus assured of an extendedoathing space,  it would  surely bo possible to convince them of the?oasonabloness of deferring discussions on long-term agricultural policy (in the period from 1948 onwards) until the nature of conditional-ons in the post war world becomes somewhat clearer.    Moreover noPledge so specific  or covering so long a period of time has beenSivon to any other industry.5*    I realise the political aspect of the Agricultural Ministers&apos;/suggestion

guggostion of oonvorsations with the farmers.    If these succeeded in bringing the farmers to earth without any possi/ble Commitment toHis Majestyrs Government thoy might do good: especially if theyelicited  some  idea of the steps the farmers proposed to take them-selves toviards the economic improvement of the industry.    If theseconversation:; were based, however,  on suppositions about &quot;guaranteedmarkets and guaranteed prices&quot;  for an indefinite period they would commit the Government by implication to the acceptance of a principle on which the Cabinet has not yet arrived at any decision.I therefore hope that the Agricultural Ministers will be satisfiedvi*-h the very practical advantage of giving the farmers a guaranteec;.&apos;i*!ie continuance   of present conditions for four years.    Duringthis time so many changes will have taken place that It is only&quot;3prudent if the Government Is to be free from the charge of &quot;lettingthe farmers down again,&quot; that it should not at this stage enter intooven general commitments regarding long-term policy.&apos;h&quot; -.1stry of Food .Ith October, 1943.
