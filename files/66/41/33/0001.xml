THIS DOCUMENT is the PROPERTY OF HIS britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET.W.P- (43) 433.4th October, 1943.WAR GABINET.jFRANCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a record of the views ofM. le Trocquer, a Socialist Deputy who has recently arrived from Paris, on thesituation and future developments in France.A. E.Foreign Office, 4th October, 1943.M. le Trocquer, who has just arrived from France in order to be a memberof the Consultative Assembly at Algiers, has been a Socialist Deputy for Paris fortwenty-three vears. He is also M. Blum&apos;s lawyer. He was one of those who wentfrom Bordeaux to Casablanca in the s.s. Massilia in June 1940. He makes an excellent impression, vigorous, honest and moderate in his views.The following are the chief points which he made in a recent conversation atthe Foreign Office : The French people are resistant and Anglophil. Some of the bourgeoisiehave put their own personal interests before the interests of France, but the mass of the people, including the peasants, are resistant and Anglophil.The French people are Gaullist. General de Gaulle has a great positionand. although the French people are republican, de Gaulle is regarded as theirleader. With the safeguards which would be provided by the consultative assembly, M. le Trocquer seemed to have no qualms whatever about de Gaulle&apos;sdictatorial personality.He could not lay &quot;too great stress on the importance of the French broadcastsfrom London. He had moved about considerably and he had noticed that thosewho had old wireless sets which were confined to long and medium waves were not so vigorous in their views as those who had up-to-date sets which could receiveon short wave. He wondered whether the B.B.C. could do anything aboutstrengthening the transmission.The direction of the Socialist Party had been overhauled since 1940 and all those who had not opposed Petain&apos;s constitutional change of July 1940 had been removed and a number of new men had been introduced.Blum. Daladier, Paul Reynaud and Mandel were now somewhere in-thesouth of Germany and were being fairly well treated. The morale of all wasexcellent, Daladier and Blum had both achieved triumphs at the Riom trial and Daladier had completely &apos;- conquered &quot; the Court. M. le Trocquer thoughtit possible that the Germans might try to use some of these politicians to set up some kind of regime in France as soon as a German collapse became imminent.(We have also been warned that we should not forget General Weygand, who isbeing well treated by the Germans in Germany and allowed to ride every morning,and who might be cast by the Germans for a similar role.)M. le Trocquer explained that he was one of those selected by resistanceorganisations in France to be a member of the Consultative Assembly at Algiers.The idea of himself and his friends in France was to build up the French12168   [26183]Copy No-
Committee of National Liberation into a provisional Government which would exercise authority in France until elections could be. held. The Committeealready formed a good nucleus and it could be expanded into a representativeFrench body. -This was his object in leaving Paris. Other names had been chosenand it was hoped that the Assembly, which was to meet on the 3rd November,would be pretty representative of the resistance organisations and parties idFrance. Fie declared that the authority of the Committee would be respectedin France and that all appointments made in its name would be accepted. Itwould be impossible to leave Vichy nominees in power after the Allied forces had landed. If they were not changed immediately, the French people would take thelaw into their own hands and remove them forcibly. The only way to prevent thishappening would be to install new prefects and officials at once. Lists hadalready been prepared with great care by the resistance organisations in Franceand would be discussed with the National Committee.On the question of the powers of the Allied Commander-in-Chief,M. le Trocquer regarded it as essential that he should not in any way appear asthe commander of a conquering army, but rather that he should come as a friendwho wished to help the French. M. le Trocquer said that, in the view of himself and his friends, the Corsican model, whereby etat de siege was introduced by a french general acting under the overriding authority of the Allied Commander-in-Chief, would be the best solution. He seemed to take it for granted that theAllied Commander-in-Chief would in the early stages have supreme powers, buthe clearly did not contemplate that the Allied Commander-in-Chief would havethe responsibility for changing officials and making appointments.M. le Trocquer confirmed what has been reported from almost every source inFrance for some time past : that since the 11th November last Petain has nofollowing whatsoever in the country.
