Printed jar the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 411.22nd September, 1943WAR CABINET.ECONOMIC SITUATION IN INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE Chiefs of Staff, in their Memorandum W.P. (43) 407, have supportedto the War Cabinet the very urgent renewal by the commander-in-Chief, India,of the Viceroy&apos;s call for help in the form of import of half a million tons offood grains between now and February 1944. Their memorandum recalls theprevious decisions of the War Cabinet (W.M. (43) 111th Conclusions) to limitimports to 50,000 tons of wheat (to be sent from Australia to Colombo &quot;fororders &quot;) and 100.000 tons of barley to India from Iraq, subject in the latter case to possibility of supply.Arrangements for 30,000 tons of wheat from Australia have so far been made,and for 5,000 tons from the United States, together with a somewhat problematicalprovision for Iraqi barley. There have also been offers of wheat and rice from american sources : in the light of the Cabinet decision these have had to be discouraged. Meanwhile the position in India has developed as the Viceroyanticipated, and the fourth quarter of the year leading up to the main riceharvest about Christmas lies before us with singularly little reason to anticipateimprovement of the situation before its end. Over India as a whole there hasnot been much change in the food position; it is still one of grave anxiety in the cities, with comparative sufficiency for the peasant producer some 50.000,000 in most rural areas, but high prices and resultant wide-spread hardship forsalaried and wage-earning classes everywhere. The conditions for improvementremain the same, namely, control by the Central Government over a sufficientreserve or buffer stock of food grains to enable them to bring prices down andto convince the 50,000,000 peasant producers that there is nothing to be gained by holding their surplus back. For that reserve there is no present availablesource other than import on a large scale; and such import is the only practicalmeans of persuading the peasant.Meanwhile the Central Government has been taking such steps as are opento it to.meet the day-to-day situation. Bombay City started rationing in Mayand the plans have worked. Plans on a similar basis are being put into operation for 70 of the larger cities; but the administrative problem presented remains a difficult one, for trained personnel is lacking and the adviser lent by the Ministryof Food has a great deal of ground to cover.Bengal is still the main danger spot. It has to be recognised that neither theProvincial Government, which is a Moslem-Hindu coalition, nor the CalcuttaCorporation, which is controlled by the Congress and has become increasinglyinefficient and corrupt, have proved themselves equal to the situation. The actingGovernor (who assumed office only on the 4th September) is taking vigorousaction : the Central Government are supporting him in his measures in whateverways are open to it and are prepared to intervene further. Nevertheless, thefact is to be faced that there are famine conditions in some of the Eastern districts and that in Calcutta hundreds are dying- of starvation, although grain is now coming into the City in a quantity sufficient, if well distributed, to feed its population on a tolerable ration scale. The position is saved from becoming worse than it is by the large proportion of the working population which is being fedthrough the efforts of industrial concerns. As to other danger areas, supplies arebeing sent to Travancore and Cochin, two of the chief sufferers from the loss of burma imports, and also to parts of Madras, where exports for Ceylon (which[26119]Copy No.
relied on Burma for some 300.000 tons of rice annually, and whose loss of thissupply it fell to S. India to try to make good) and elsewhere have proved too heavy a drain on local supplies and have lead to serious shortage.So far there has been no widespread disorder and it might be suggestedthat since the situation is for the moment being held without the imported supplies the Viceroy asks for, the necessity for imported supplies no longer exists. I wishto impress upon my colleagues, firstly, that the present position in Bengal is aAery grim one. and, secondly, that the worst point is yet to come. The new crops are said to be doing well over most of India; but the main rice crop is notharvested till the end of the year and the millets only a little earlier, so that forthe next three months the people have to depend upon the old crop. Thesemonths are always difficult, and this year they have to be faced from a bad startand with a prospect of increasing pressure on Indian resources to meetoperational needs.Longer term measures are being taken. The Committee under theChancellor of the Exchequer is considering anti-inflation moves in general(which would incidentally help to bring food on to ,the market), and the Govern-ment of India have already met with some success in their endeavour to check the rise in the general price level. Last years Grow More Food campaign hasbeen intensified, and where 8 million additional acres wore brought under foodcrops last season 12 million will be brought under food crops this year, mostlyunder millets. Other long-term measures are expected to emerge from therecommendations of the Government of India&apos;s Long-Term Food PolicyCommittee which has just reported. I have not yet received an official summaryof its report, but I understand that it not only recommends the importation ofone million tons of grain annually till normal conditions are re-established, butstrongly urges the necessity to import at once 500,000 tons to afford, so to say.the spring-board from which to launch its long-term policy with prospect ofsuccess.This last recommendation is of immediate importance, for we cannot look toany of. the Committee&apos;s long-term recommendations nor to any of the other measures referred to above to help us through the dangers which must be facedthis present autumn. In Bengal famine conditions already exist and elsewhereconditions bordering on famine. In a telegram dated the 19th September the acting Governor of Bengal reports :  I have wandered round Calcutta after nightfall and scenes are prettyghastly. I have also done a long mufti tour through twenty-fourPergunnahs district where a number of relief centres are functioning.Conditions outwardly are not so bad as in the City, but very large proportionof destitutes in the City come from Pergunnahs and nearby districtsattracted by charity relief arrangements.. The trouble in Pergunnahs is largely due to cultivators owing to previous bad harvest not having enoughgrain to keep landless labour going till aman harvest [i.e., the main Vice cropreaped in November-December) and fear of what may happen to themselvesshould aman paddy crop be damaged, though at present it looks veryflourishing......Even  if  all promised  supplies  of  food-stuffs  comethrough. I envisage a large death roll throughout the province from starvation-tion following a previous malnutrition, coupled with endemic malaria during next 3-^ months. Though famine is not officially declared, conditions arethose of famine for the landless labourer in many areas and the normalwreckage of population which subsists on charity.&quot;The conditions so described are becoming a serious menace to supplyoperations and to the movement of troops. The sight of famine conditions cannot but cause distress to the Fairopean troops and anxiety to the Indian troops as tothe condition of their families in other parts of India (where, as noted above,conditions afford ample cause for anxiety), and they provide all the more a very dangerous handle to Japanese propaganda of which full use is being made.In all these circumstances I must most earnestly urge the War Cabinet to reconsider in the light of the Chiefs of Staff memorandum the request of theGovernment of India for the import of up to half a million tons of food grainsto India between this month and March of next year. The War Cabinet willnot forget the terms in which the Viceroy urged reconsideration of this case inhis telegram of the 13th August last, which is appended.L. S. A.India Office 22nd September, 1943.
APPENDIX:tTelegram j ram Viceroy to Secretary of State for India.(Dated New Delhi, 1805 hours, 13th August, 1943.)(Received 1730 hours, 13th August, 1943.)1742-S. Personal. Your personal telegram of 7th August, 17601. food imports. I fully appreciate difficulties that confront Cabinet, But I am boundin duty to represent critical nature of difficulties that will face us here unlessdecision contained in your telegram is modified. A firm promise of 100,000 tonsof barley, and possibility of small additional quantity of wheat, will go nowherein meeting our essential demands, and, after consulting and in full agreementwith Commander-in-Chief, Finance Member and Food Member, I am bound interms to warn Cabinet that Government of India and I cannot be responsible for continuing stability of India now. or for her capacity to serve as a base against japan next year unless we have appropriate help in prospect. You will befamiliar from press with critical situation that faces us in Bengal. And distinctsigns are beginning to emerge that wheat position in the Punjab is hardeningagainst us with higher prices and a diminishing flow from cultivators to markets.The addition of transport&apos; breakdown owing to very major breaches in communication with Eastern India which have followed on recent floods, andwhich there is no hope of our being able to remedy effectively under at least a couple of months, has further aggravated the situation and brought out vitalimportance of being able to run food .directly to Calcutta by sea (we have considered putting assistance by way of putting food grains into Calcutta atminimum of two ships, or 15.000 tons a month; and I would classify this as a security operation essential to lines of communication of the army). On generalfood (? position) I can only repeat what I have already said and convey to HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the most formal manner possible the considered warninggiven earlier. If they are not prepared to modify their decision, we here can take no responsibility for the consequences. And it is essential that (? should be) fully understood at this stage, and the fact what is in issue is not merely feeding India,but our capacity to wage war against Japan.\
