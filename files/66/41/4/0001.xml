THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.    September 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 404.17th September, 1943.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED MEETING WITH DOMINION PRIME MINISTERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.ON the 8th September, at the Prime Ministers request, I sent to the PrimeMinisters of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa a telegram, ofwhich a copy is annexed (Appendix 1), making a definite proposal for a meetingof the five Prime Ministers in London in November.I now annex (Appendices 2, 3, 4) the replies received from Canada, Australiaand New Zealand to this invitation. General Smuts has not replied directly,but he has sent a separate telegram (Appendix 5) in reply to one sent to him bythe Prime Minister suggesting that his presence here at an early date would bevery useful. General Smuts, in response to the Prime Minister&apos;s request, statesthat he proposes to a nave here on the 5th October.In the meantime, in view of developments regarding the proposed Three-Power Meetings, the Prime Minister suggested to me on the 14th September thatit would seem wise to postpone the suggested Conference with Dominion PrimeMinisters from November till January, though he added that it would be good tohave General&apos;Smuts in London as soon as he could come.The position thus reached is that Mr. Fraser can say nothing until after his election, though there is no reason to doubt that he will be willing to comeif he remains Prime Minister. Mr. Mackenzie King is prepared to come inNovember for a short meeting, and could probably be persuaded to come insteadin January, if asked, though the Session of the Canadian Parliament would present a difficulty. Mr. Curtin argues that he cannot come until April next,but we might perhaps press him strongly to come in January as a compromiseif it were a case of that or nothing. The real clifficukv seems to be General Smutswho, if he arrives in October, may not wish to stay here until January for ameeting with the other Prime Ministers, more especially as the South AfricanParliament will meet in January.My colleagues will remember that the question of organising a meeting withthe Dominion Prime Ministers has now dragged on since the summer of 1940.Every time either political difficulties in the Dominions or timetable complicationshave prevented any definite arrangements being made.I think the time has come when we ought to make up our minds to press this question strongly in spite of the obvious difficulties and do our utmost toensure that a meeting takes place. We have reached a stage at which it isessential that there should be a full discussion of post-war policy between the heads of the constituent States of the Commonwealth and also of the machinerywhereby, in collaborating with the major Allies, the British Commonwealth willbe able to express a united view. I would go so far as to say that such a meetingis vital in so far as the relations of the Dominions to the United Kingdom in thepost-war world are involved. There is also, of course, the important questionof the prestige which, a meeting between the Heads of the Governments of theCommonwealth at this stage would have in the world generally. Our critics inParliament will never be satisfied that we are taking Empire co-operationseriously unless we in fact bring about an Empire meeting of this kind and canbuild on the results.I suggest, therefore, that the Prime Minister should send a personal message to each of the Dominion Prime Ministers urging him to do his utmost to attend a meeting not later than January. It should in fact be a major objective of our policy to bring such a meeting about.[26096]Copy No.
I feel that in the last resort we should be able to persuade Mr. Fraser,Mr. Curtin and Mr. Mackenzie King without too much difficulty; the realcomplication seems to be General Smuts, who, if he arrives in October, may wellfind it difficult either to stay here until January or to return again in January.In that case, I think it would be better to ask General Smuts to defer his visituntil January, glad as we should ail be otherwise to see him here as early asOctober.C. R. A.Dominions Office. 17/7/ September, 1943.APPENDIX 1.Telegram of 8th September from Dominions Office to the four DominionGovernments.(D. No. 633.   Secret and Personal.)Following from Deputy Prime Minister for Prime Minister :-Prime Minister has asked me to recall to you his message in telegramD. No. 219 of loth April. Now that the Australian and South African electionsare over and that the New Zealand election has been fixed for September,Mr. Churchill greatly hopes that it will now be found possible definitely toarrange a meeting of the five Prime Ministers in London in November. There arestrong reasons for holding such a meeting, as explained in that telegram, and recent events have, indeed, emphasized the desirability of early consultation between the Prime Ministers, especially on post-war problems. [t is not, ofcourse, a formal Imperial Conference of the pre-war type that is in mind, but ameeting of the five Prime Ministers, the number of official advisers being kept tothe minimum.The importance of adequate preparation was stressed in replies to the PrimeMinisters earlier message. We are fully alive to the importance of this and, ifthe date proposed is generally acceptable, we would send as soon as possible for your consideration suggestions as to the agenda for the meetings ancl as to the best method of arranging for the necessary preparatory work. As time is short forthis. Prime Minister would be grateful for the earliest possible reply.APPENDIX 2.Telegram of loth September from Canadian Govt rnment.(No. 146.   Secret and Personal.)Your telegram D. No. 633 of 8th September.   Secret and Personal.Following from the Prime Minister for the Deputy Prime Minister :  I have told Mr. Churchill that, in anything he regards as of first importance,I shall endeavour to let nothing stand in the way of meeting his wishes. I shall therefore do my utmost to attend the meeting of Prime Ministers in London inNovember. I must, however, point out, as I did to Mr. Churchill in Quebec, that my colleagues and I have been obliged to give our attention so exclusively to matters immediately pertaining to the prosecution of the war that, unless we canavail ourselves of the opportunity, which the present adjournment of Parliamentaffords, to deal with the domestic situation, I am afraid it may get so completelyout of hand that the consequence^ may prove most prejudicial to the governments position, and to Canada&apos;s war effort. For this reason I much hope that, if it is decided to have a meeting in November, matters may be so arranged that the pro-ceedings will be as brief as possible. I sincerely hope that, whenever theconference is held, all Prime Ministers may find it possible to be present.
APPENDIX 3.Telegram of 14th September from Australian Government.(No. 240.   Secret and Personal.)Following for Deputy Prime Minister from Prime Minister : 1. Reference your telegram D. No. 633, a meeting in November, from my own point of view, is too early for the following reasons : (i) The new Parliament assembles on 23rd September.(ii) It is proposed to have a session of a few weeks when the main businesswill be the Budget.(iii) The new Government will require some time to settle down, particularly as the first major business in the recess will be to review theAustralian war effort,(iv) Owing to an acute man-power situation, it is evident that we cannotachieve some of the objectives or commitments we have undertaken.It is essential from the aspect of our own policy for us to determine the precise limits and nature of the contribution of which we are capablein order to enable this to be related to the wider plans of the Empireand the United Nations, into which our effort is fitted.When fully resolved, these matters, are. of course, suitable for mutualdecision with the other parts of the Empire, but there is much to bedone here by the Government first, and then by consultation with theCommander-in-Chief, S.W.P.A. I feel that my presence here duringthe next 6 months of legislative and administrative activity isessential for, as Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, I am theonly Minister who has a precise personal knowledge of the factorsrelating to the problems which will arise.(v) Finally the Australian forces are in the midst of important operations in New Guinea, and I do not feel satisfied in leaving Australia untilthe results of the decision to carry on the war in the Pacific with thesame vigour as the war in Europe are evident, both in the increasedstrength dispersed in the Pacific and in approved plans for operations against the Japanese.2. I would suggest that the meeting be held not earlier than the beginningof April, or later if possible.APPENDIX 4.Telegram of 11th September from New Zealand Government.(No. 391.   Most Secret and Personal.)For Deputy Prime Minister from Prime Minister :  Invitation to attend meeting has been conveyed to Prime Minister nowtouring New Zealand on election campaign. He regrets he is not in a positionto give any answer until after the General Flection which is to be held on25th September.APPENDIX 5.Telegram of 14th September from United Kingdom High Commissioner inSouth Africa.(No. 1210.   Most Secret and Personal.)Following personal for Prime Minister from General Smuts : Your telegram No. 1179 has decided me to carry out my original intentionto be in London first week in October. I intend leaving here on 25th September,arriving in Cairo on 27th September. I shall spend four days in Egypt con-suiting with Casey, Wilson, and others, and four days in North Africa withEisenhower, MacMillan, and other Chiefs within reach, and thus obtain first handpicture of situation. Chief of General Staff will accompany me to London, where we hope to arrive 5th October.
