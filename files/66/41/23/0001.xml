They then approved my proposal that I should remind M. Molotov ofour agreement with the Soviet Government in 1942 that both Governments should refrain from concluding treaties covering the post-war period with minor Allies,but that, if the Soviet Government still insisted on a treaty, we might agreethat the proposed Soviet-Czechoslovak Treaty should be concluded in the formof an instalment of a Three-Power Treaty which could include Poland at alater date; we should, however, say that we hoped that there would be no furtherexceptions to the self-denying ordinance (W.C. Conclusions 89 (43) of the28th June, item 5. and 93 (43) of the 5th July, item 5).2. Before this action could be taken, it was learned from Dr. Benes thatin view of our misgivings the Soviet Government had suggested postponing theconclusion of a treaty and Dr. Benes:s Moscow visit.3. I have since been in consultation with the Soviet Government with a viewto clearing up certain misunderstandings about the &quot;self-denying ordinance.&quot;In accordance with their proposal I am now communicating to them a draft,the text of which will be found at Annex 1, with the suggestion that the question-should be placed on the agenda of my forthcoming conversations with the soviet and United States representatives. The text of a statement I made in theHouse of Commons on the 22nd September is attached as Annex 2.4. Apart from the question of &quot; the self-denying ordinance &quot; and theimportance of avoiding open competition between His Majesty*s Government andthe Soviet Government for the friendship of our minor European allies, my mainobjection to the proposed Soviet-Czechoslovak agreement is that it would beregarded as directed against Poland, and would make any satisfactory solutionof Eastern European problems more difficult.5. There remains the possibility of meeting this difficulty by stating thatany bilateral Soviet-Czechoslovak arrangements were open to subsequentaccession-by Poland (see paragraph 1 above). This would not, however, dispose of the matter, since (a) the Polish Government could not accede until the SovietGovernment condescended to enter into diplomatic relations with them, and(b) the Soviet-Czechoslovak arrangements would deal with Czechoslovak interestsand consequently offer no benefits to Poland.6. There therefore seem to be two alternative courses of action : (1) To reach agreement with the Soviet Government on the text of the &quot; self-denying ordinance&quot; at Annex 1 and to refuse to agree to anyexceptions. (This would, of course, bar us from making any similarbilateral agreements, e.g., with Greece, Norway, Holland or Belgium.)12162   [26150]

It is forconsideration whether, in such an event, we should not also offer toparticipate ourselves in such an arrangement and thus makequadrilateral;Ke u7.   There are certain obvious advantagesm making a constructiveproposalon the lines of paragraph 6 (2). Progress on these lines will, however, beimpossible without the restoration of Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations, which depends upon some prior agreement regarding the future Polish-Soviet frontiersThis question is discussed in a paper I am submitting separately to my colleaguesI need only mention here the obvious difficulty for any Government in-exile toagree to give up any of its pre-war territory.8. There remains the question of our own participation. Unless weparticipate in some way, there is little chance of reaching a stable and satisfactory solution of this Eastern European question. We are still bound by our alliance with Poland, and although we refused a request from the Polish Government inJune 1942 to negotiate a new Anglo-Polish treaty to replace that of August 1939,we then informed the Polish Government that &quot; we should, of course, enter into consultation with them in good time before August 1944 &quot; (when the 1939 treatycan be terminated by either party). &quot;&apos; so that the two Governments might consider how best to maintain and prolong its effects.&quot; We added that we should preferthis consultation to take place &quot; when the future was clearer and when the twoGovernments could also consider, inter alia, how best Anglo-Polish relations couldbe fitted into a regional or general system of security.&quot; We also informed thePolish Government in April 1942 that we intended to &quot;uphold the interests ofour Polish ally, as of our other allies, to the fullest extent to which we were capable, and that for this purpose we would accept our full share of responsibilityfor the establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe after the war.&quot; our existing agreement with Poland could thus be merged in a new Four-PowerTreaty.9.   I do not think it necessary to reach any final decision regarding british   would like, however, to have my colleagues&apos; approvalparticipation at this stage of the following line at the Conference :  (a) I should endeavour to secure Soviet agreement to the proposed &quot;self-denying ordinance.&quot;(b) I should not myself take the initiative in proposing any exceptions to the&quot;self-denying ordinance,&quot; and should oppose the early conclusion ofany bilateral Soviet-Czechoslovak arrangement.(c) If other discussions at the Conference on matters affecting Soviet-Polishrelations suggest that the atmosphere is favourable. I would informthe Soviet Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government, while maintaining their objections to a Soviet-Czechoslovak agreement,would be prepared to collaborate in trying to arrange the conclusionof a tripartite agreement between the U.S.S.R.. Poiand and czechoslovakia.Foreign Office, 28th September, 1943.
ANNEX 2.Mr. W. Brown asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether hecan make any statement to the House about the proposed visit of President Benesto Moscow; and what steps he has taken to facilitate his visit?Mr. Eden: During M. Molotov&apos;s visit to London last year discussions tookplace regarding the conclusion of agreements between His Majesty&apos;s government or the Soviet Government on the one hand and any of our other European Allieson the other concerning post-war arrangements. As a result of these discussionsHis Majesty&apos;s Government understood that both Governments held the view thatit was preferable for neither of them to conclude any such agreements for themoment.When President Benes spoke to me of his proposed visit to Moscow with aview to concluding such an agreement, I naturally informed him of the discussions which had taken place with M. Molotov and the matter was also mentioned to theSoviet Government in accordance with our understanding of the arrangementsreached between us in 1942. Shortly afterwards I was informed by PresidentBenes that his visit had been postponed.Discussions are, however, proceeding between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Soviet and Czechoslovak Governments, and I hope to have an opportunityto discuss the matter personally with M. Molotov at my forthcoming meeting with soviet, and American representatives. I am, of course, also maintaining close contact with the Czechoslovak Government.Referring to the aide-memoire handed to His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs on the 26th July by the Soviet Charge d&apos;Affairesin London and to the further memorandum sent by M. Sobolev on the 30th Augustconcerning the understanding between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics notto enter into commitments or agreements with certain other countries in europe in respect of post-war questions, Mr. Eden has the honour, in accordance withthe suggestion of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, to propose, for the consideration of the latter, an exchange of notes between the twoGovernments, which he suggests should be in the following terms :  &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, bearing in mind theobligation upon themselves and the Soviet Government under the Anglo-soviet treaty of the 26th May, 1942, to collaborate with regard to post-war matters, andhaving regard to the importance of securing in the final post-war settlement a jmstbalance between rival views and claims that may be put forward by other european governments, consider it in principle advisable that, pending that settlement, thetwo Governments should avoid entering into any commitments or agreements withother European countries allied with them in the common struggle relating to theperiod after the cessation of hostilities in Europe.;&apos;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom therefore propose that,pending the final post-war settlement, the two Governments should agree that neither of them will negotiate any commitments or agreements with any other european countries allied with them in the common struggle in respect of questions covering the peace settlement or post-war period. The two governments will consult with one another whenever necessary so that the observance of thisagreement may harmonise with their respective and joint interests.&quot;If the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics accept thisproposal, the present note and your reply to that effect will serve to place on formalrecord the understanding between the two Governments in this matter.&quot;Mr. Eden has instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow to proposeto the Soviet Government that this matter should be placed upon the agenda ofthe Anglo-Soviet-United States Conference which it is proposed to hold in moscow next month.Foreign Office. 28th September, 1943.
