THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET.NOTES BY THE PRIME  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN secretary at THE FORTHCOMING MEETING.1. Great Britain seeks no territory or special advantage for herself as the outcome of the war which she entered in pursuance of her obligations and in defence of public law.2. We hold strongly to a system of a League of Nations which will include a council of Europe with an International Court and an Armed Power capable of enforcing its decisions. During the Armistice period, which may be prolonged,we hold that the three great Powers, the British Commonwealth and Empire, theUnited States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, with the addition ofChina, should remain united, well-armed and capable of enforcing the armistice terms and of building up the permanent structure of peace throughout the globe.3. We consider that States and Nations that have been subjugated by Nazior Fascist violence during the war should emerge at the Peace Conference withtheir full sovereign rights and that all questions of final territorial transferencemust be settled at the peace table, due regard being paid to the interests of the populations affected.4. We reaffirm the principles of the Atlantic Charter, noting that Russia&apos;saccession thereto is based upon the frontiers of the 22ncl June, 1941. We also take note of the historic frontiers of Russia before the two wars of aggressionwaged by Germany in 1914 and 1939.5. We should welcome any agreement between Poland and Russia whichwhile securing a strong and independent Poland, afforded to Russia the securitynecessary for her Western frontier.6. We are resolved that Nazism and Fascism shall be extirpated in the aggressor countries where they, have taken root and that democratic Govern-ments based upon the free expression of the people&apos;s will, obtained under conditions of reasonable tranquillity, shall be set up. This should not excludemeasures of military diplomacy or relations with interim Governments whichmay come into being, so that our main objects may be achieved with a minimum of slaughter, especially to the Forces of the Allies.7. We repudiate all territorial expansion achieved by Germany or Italyduring the Nazi or Fascist regimes and further we consider that the futurestructure of Germany and the position of Prussia as a unit of the German state should be subject to an agreed policy among the three great Powers of the West.8. We are resolved to take all measures necessary to prevent the guiltyPowers from becoming an armed menace to the peace of Europe, not only bydisarmament but by prolonged control of every form of warlike apparatus organisation within their bounds.9. We have no desire to keep any branch of the European family of nations in a condition of subjection or restriction except as may be required by the general needs and safety of the world.10. We proclaim our inflexible resolve to use the authority which victory-will confer upon the three great Powers in order to serve the general good andthe cause of human progress.W. S. C.11.10.43.
