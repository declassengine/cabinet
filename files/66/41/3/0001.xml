NAVAL  SITUATION.General Review.1.   The main strength of the Italian fleet is now under Allied control.Our naval forces have carried out bombardments in the Gulf of Salerno insupport of the Army throughout the week. There have been several casualties among ELM. and Allied ships.Two U-boats have been sunk and one probably damaged in theMediterranean.Except for one ship sunk by aircraft, there have been no shipping lossesreported.Northern Waters.2. Air reconnaissance of lee fjord, Spitsbergen, on the 10th showed the settlements to have been Completely destroyed and with no sign of life.Home Waters.3. A large-scale amphibious exercise, which took place early on the 9th inthe Channel, was carried out according to plan.Allied coastal forces have fought several engagements during the week. Onthe 11th. two Norwegian M.T.Bs. attacked enemy escort and patrol craft off.Kristiansund and sank a ship of 4.000 tons. Off the French coast, three M.T.Bs.were in action with five tank landing craft. Off Sark. two British ami two FrenchM.T.Bs. intercepted a convoy of five small ships and set a trawler on fire;one M.T.B. was damaged. On the night of the 13th/14th. five M.T.Bs. attacked a southbound convoy escorted by E-boats off the Dutch coast and torpedoed a ship of 1.000 tons.H.M.S. Winchelsea (destroyer), while, escorting a southbound convoy, was severely damaged by a near miss in an attack by F.W. aircraft west of cape Finisterre, but returned to port.Mediterranean.Italian Fleet.4. The greater part of the Italian fleet has sailed from various ports,including Trieste, to ports under Allied control. There are now in our handstwo Littorio class battleships, Italia and Vittorio Veneto, three older battleships.Andrea Doria, Caio Duilio and Giulio Cesare, six 6&quot; cruisers, two 5-3&quot; cruisers and the seaplane carrier Giuseppe Miraglia. There are also at least eight destroyers, eight torpedo-boats, 17 submarines and the sloop Eritrea whichsurrendered at Colombo. The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, sent thefollowing message on the 11th to the Secretary of the Admiralty : &quot; Be pleased to inform their Lordships that the Italian battle fleet now lies at anchor underthe guns of the Fortress of Malta.&quot; On the 16th the Italia and Vittorio Venetowith four cruisers and four destroyers arrived at Alexandria.The battleship Conte Di favour is still at Trieste under refit, and the newLittorio class battleship Impero. under construction, is also at Trieste. The twodamaged 8&quot; cruisers Bolzano and Gorizia remain at Spezia. Twenty-four destroyers and about 35 torpedo-boats and 40/45 subm re under Axiscontrol or have not yet been accounted for.The cruiser Regolo with three destroyers arrived at Port Mahon, Minorca,and was interned. One torpedo-boat was interned at Pollensa, Majorca, in adamaged state and two others were scuttled off Pollensa.The Litiorio class battleship Roma was bombed and sunk by German aircraft on the 9th off the coast of Sardinia. Two destroyers were also sunk. H.M. S/MSportsman rescued 44 survivors on the 12th.5. H.M. and Allied ships have continued to provide support and coveringfire for the operations in the Gulf of Salerno. Naval sea fires gave fighter coverfrom H.M. aircraft carriers for four days until they were able to use an airfieldashore at Paestum. The initial landings on the 9th took place in good weather,but the movement of ships shoreward was delayed by mines/ H.M. shipsAbercrombie (monitor) and Cadmus (minesweeper) were damaged by mine.FI.M.S. Mendip (destroyer) was damaged by aircraft attack. On&apos; the 10th, theport party arrived at Salerno and found many mines and booby traps in the
harbour. On the following day the port was opened; berths were made availablefor tank-landing ships. A number of attacks on the naval forces was carriedout by enemy aircraft. H.M.S. Uganda (cruiser) was seriously damaged by arocket-propelled glider bomb, and the U.S.S. Savannah (cruiser) was damaged by a similar bomb. The U.S.S. Philadelphia (cruiser) and the Dutch gunboatFlores also received damage in aircraft attacks. The U.S.S. Rowan (destroyer)was sunk by E-boat while escorting a convoy from North Africa. On the 13th,in 24 hours, 850 tons of supplies were discharged in the harbour. Three Britishhospital ships were attacked by aircraft south-west of Salerno; one, thes.s. Newfoundland was set on fire and subsequently sank. H.M. destroyers Loyaland Laforey, which were escorting a convoy, were slightly damaged by enemy action. On the 14th, the harbour came under shell fire and was temporarilyout of use. Unloading on the beaches continued satisfactorily. Naval gunfirein the Salerno area broke up a tank offensive three miles from the beaches apartfrom the shelling of enemy positions and troop concentrations. On the 15thH.M. ships War spite and Valiant arrived and carried out a bombardment.6. At Taranto, H.M. and Allied ships berthed in the harbour on the 9th;the Italian fleet had already sailed. No demolition or sabotage had taken place,the port was ready to operate and the authorities were willing to give assistance.During the night, however, HALS. Abdiel (minelayer), with military equipment and vehicles on board, was sunk by mine in the harbour. There were heavymilitary casualties.Small parties arrived at Brindisi and Bari on the 11th. Cotrone harbour-was occupied by our forces on the following day and was found to be intact. the island of Capri was occupied on the 14th.7. German light forces evacuated Bastia (Corsica) on the 9th after beingshelled by shore batteries, an Italian destroyer and by H.M. S/M Sportsman. Onthe 13th a party was landed at Bastia from the French S/M Casabianca. On the night of the 12th/13th a minor landing was made by Allied forces at Ajaccioancl, two nights later, 600 troops were landed from the French destroyersLe Fantasque and Le Terrible.Ventotene Island (west of Naples) was surrendered in the night of the9th/10th by the Italian garrison without resistance.8.   H.M. submarines have reported the following : Unsparing, on the 31st, sank a 1,300-ton ship off Bari.Unshaken, on the 5th, torpedoed a 7,000-ton tanker off Brindisi.Black Sea.9. Russian naval personnel have carried out a raid near Budenovka(N.W. Crimea). Much damage was done, an R-boat was sunk, two smallminesweepers captured and over 200 Germans killed or taken prisoner.Pacific.10. The U.S. S/M Grenadier has failed to return from patrol ancl must beconsidered lost.The Japanese have admitted that the liner Yamato Maru (9,656 tons) was sunk on the 13th by an Allied submarine between Japan and Formosa.Solomons.11. Four M.T.Bs. attacked and damaged three enemy barges on the 7thnorth of Vella Lavella.   Two of the M.T.Bs. grounded and were Later destroyed.The Japanese evacuation of Ysabel Island, including Rekata Bay, has been confirmed.Neiv Guinea.12. Allied destroyers bombarded Malabang (near Lae) on the night of the7th/8th. Allied M.T.Bs., on the following night, machine-gunned the beach nearFinschhafen (north of Huon Gulf). On the 10th, M.T.Bs. sank three barges and damaged a fourth at Blucher Point, north of Finschhafen.Air photographs of Wewak on the 9th showed mostly sunken ships in the harbour, including two cargo ships of medium size.[26087]    ^ 1 B
Anti-Submarine Operations.13. Nineteen attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week; elevenby aircraft and eight by surface craft.A German U-boat, on the 12th, was beached after an attack by a Wellingtonaircraft east of Gibraltar and was then bombed and shelled and finally destroyedby the Dutch A/S trawler Haarlem. A Bisley aircraft, on the same day, sank aU-boat south of Sardinia : 20 of the crew were seen in the water. On thefollowing night a U.S. Liberator (B. 24) probably damaged a U-boat west ofSardinia.Enemy Intelligence.German.14. The Tirpitz and Scharnhorst were seen by Russian air reconnaissanceon the 12th to have returned to Kaafiord.A rocket-propelled glider-bomber, which as far as is known is carried only by Do. 217 aircraft, has been used in recent attacks on ships. It is apparentlywireless-controlled from the aircraft. In the attack on HALS. Uganda on the11th, as in some previous cases, the bomb was released well beyond effective range of the ships anti-aircraft fire.During the last fortnight of August. 27 troop transports arrived at Oslofrom the south in convoys of five or six ships and sailed fully laden with troops and war material to German and Danish ports.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15.   No ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during the week.A straggler from a homeward-bound convoy was sunk while in tow by F.W.aircraft west of Cape Finisterre.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending the 12th, 891 ships were convoyed. Of these230 ships were in ocean convoys and 661 in British coastal convoys. Seventy-ninedestroyers (including 11 U.S. destroyers), 95 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes(including five U.S. cutters) and one anti-aircraft ship, were employed on escort duties.Four ocean convoys, consisting of 165 ships, arrived in Home Waters without loss.During the week ending the 11th, imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 1.396.000 tons, compared with 1,297,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 1,050,000 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports, 699,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.British Minelaying.17.   During the week surface craft laid mines off the Dutch coast.There was no minelaying by home-based aircraft, but mines were laid off thecoast of Burma.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.18. There have been no reports of minelaying by surface craft during theweek, but aircraft have laid mines in the Thames Estuary.Eight mines have been destroyed off the East Coast. The mine totals are4,461 ground and 3,109 moored.Dangerous areas have been declared in Taranto harbour, in the Gulf of Naplesand the Gulf of Gaeta and also in the entrance to the White Sea.19. The total number of minesweepers in commission has risen from 76, inSeptember 1939. and 655 in September 1940, to 1,271 in September 1943.Losses of minesweepers up to September 1943 have totalled 200. Amono- these,82 have been caused by mines and 65 by aircraft.Italian Merchant Shipping.20. Seventeen Italian ships (97,000 tons) are in neutral ports outside theMediterranean.   In French ports there are at least ten ships (47,000 tons) of over
1,000 tons, including four tankers. Several of these have been engaged in blockaderunning to the Far East.In the Mediterranean, a number of ships has arrived in ports under allied control but the total is not yet known.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21. Reconnaissances covering the six months to the end of July show aconsiderable increase in merchant shipping construction in the occupied countries and Western Europe. In the Low Countries nine large and 16 medium keels were laid down, as compared with five large and two medium in the previous six months;the total at present on the slips is 35 ships of 200 feet or over. Danish yards were mainly engaged in large and medium ships and tankers. In the Norwegian yards,which are chiefly building whalers, coasters and tugs, a new development has beenthe building of concrete barges. In French shipyards the rate of work has beenvery low. It is estimated that at the end of July about 114,000 tons of merchantshipping was under construction.The iron ore trade between Spanish and French ports which had been in abeyance since the middle of July was resumed on the 9th, when a Spanish shipsailed from Bilbao.It is now known that the German tanker Nerd A atlantic (9,897 tons) is stillin Camarinas Bay and will be towed to Ferrol as soon as the weather is suitable;she is unable to proceed under her own steam. About 3,000 tons of oil have beensalved and stored in Ferrol.Spanish Intelligence.22. The Spanish authorities have immobilised three Danish ships, totalling5,800 tons, which have been taking refuge at Ferrol since April 1940.MILITARY SITUATION.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)23. Within a few hours of our invasion of the Naples/Salerno area which,as reported in last week&apos;s Resume, started in the early hours of the 9th, leadingbrigades of British and U.S. formations were established ashore. this operation was being carried out at the extreme range of our fighter air cover andwas mounted from ports, many of which had lately been in the hands of theenemy. Strong enemy forces were known to be in the assault area, and thesuccess of this operation was not expected to be easy.   And so it has proved.24. Apart from mines and some shelling from coastal batteries the assaulttroops got ashore without much difficulty. Gennan reaction was quick, and took the form of numerous counter-attacks by small battle groups supported by tanks.These attacks were held and by the 10th U.S. forces had established a bridgeheadfrom Agropoli through Torchiara to the line of the River Sele; to their northBritish troops had advanced to Battipaglia and captured the airfield at Monte-corvino. The port of Salerno was cleared and was opened on the 11th, when a.A. defences were installed. By this time the enemy had realised theimportance of our attack and had concentrated his forces. His object evidentlywas to cut our bridgehead in half, and a heavy counter-attack was launched onthe 12th, which continued throughout the following day and the situation becamecritical. We were forced to withdraAv from Battipaglia and on the followingclay, the 13th, a considerable peneration on a two-mile front was made along theline of the River Sele.Meanwhile reinforcements had arrived by sea and air. Maximum supportwas given by heavy and medium bombers and fighters, and by naval bombardment;the German attempt to break through was held. More Allied formations,including armour, arrived and by the 15th we had consolidated our positions anda very dangerous moment was past.25. The Eighth Army in Calabria are making every effort to reach theSalerno area and threaten the flank of the German forces. The seaborne landing on the 7th/8th (reported in last week&apos;s Resume) was successful and our advance&apos; T26087] b 2
up the west coast lias gone quicker. On the east coast Canadian forces enteredCotrone on the 11th. They then moved inland and are now established betweenSpezzano and Castrovillari.British troops in the west sector encountered only demolitions, and maderapid progress entering Cozenza and Scalea on the 14th. Patrols pushed on withall speed and to-day are as far forward as Sapri, forty miles from the Fifth U.S.Army battle zone.26. A third British force has entered Italy in the Taranto-Brindisi area.Following the Italian capitulation warships of the Royal Navy, carrying Britishformations, entered Taranto unopposed on the 9th. These troops, acting withgreat speed and initiative, entered Brindisi on the 11th, and found seven airfields in this area to be in good condition. Contact with the enemy has been made atGoioa Del Colle 25 miles N.W. of Taranto. During the course of these operations309 prisoners of war were rescued from a camp at Pisticci. Reinforcements havearrived and the position in this area is satisfactory.27. This week has been one of great effort and considerable anxiety. TheGermans quickly appreciated the position and made their main efforts againstthe Fifth U.S. Army. A race has therefore developed between these efforts todislodge our troops from the bridgehead and the arrival of the Eighth Army ontheir flank. The position at the moment is more favourable than we thought two days ago. but the critical period is not yet over.Middle East.28. The C-in-C, Middle East, decided to exploit Italian capitulation byseizing certain islands in the Dodecanese and elsewhere in the JEgean area. Onthe night of the 9th/10th, Castelrosso was occupied by light forces and recon-naissance detachments were sent to the islands of Kos and Leros; on the 14th Koswas reinforced by an infantry detachment.The Italian garrison on the Greek Island of Samos surrendered to the Greekson the 9th.In Crete, Scarpanto and Rhodes, the Italian garrisons have been overcome by the Germans.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing operations up to the 14th September. 1943.is included, as an inset.)Smolensk Sector.29 The Russians are meeting strong German resistance in this sector andhave made no further progress.Bryansk Sector.30. After being held up for a time, the Russians have now resumed their advance. Thrusts wdiich developed both north and south of Bryansk resulted onthe 13th in the capture of two railway junctions close to the city and on the eastbank of the River Desna. On the 14th the evacuation of Bryansk itself by theGermans was reported.  Dyadkovo (25 miles north of Bryansk) has been captured.Kiev Direction.31. The Russians continue to make excellent progress towards the Dnieper.The main progress of their thrust is still towards the west, but progress hasalso been made to the north-west and south-west. The Desna was crossed, on the10th north-west of Glukhov. The foremost Russian troops are now 65 miles west of Konotop and within 45 miles of the Dnieper at its confluence with thePripet. Njedjin was captured at dawn on the 15th; the Russians have crossed the River peninsula at several points and occupied Sencha (20 miles north-east ofLubni).Kharkov Sector.32. The Russians have captured Novaya Vodolaga (20 miles south-west of Kharkov.
Dnieper Bend Sector.33. In this area the Russians have continued to make rapid progress.Barvenkovo, Krasnoarmeisk, Stalino and Mariupol have been captured, and russian forces due west of Stalino have now reached, points only 50 miles fromthe Dnieper bend. The Russians continued to advance, occupying over 120inhabited localities. Russian troops gained possession of Gulyai Polye (50 miles east-south-east of Zaporozhe), Pokroyeskoye (50 miles east-north-east ofZaporozhe) and the railway centre of Kuibishevo (70 miles north-east ofMelitopol).Tayuin Bridgehead.34. The Germans have reported a fresh Russian landing attempt in theNovorossisk area and have even mentioned street fighting in the town; on the evening of the 16th the Russians reported that Novorossisk fell to a combined land and sea assault.Summary.35. The Russians are steadily approaching the Dnieper along the greaterpart of its length, and it is becoming increasingly likely that the Germans willwithdraw to the west bank of this river between Orsha and Zaporozhe. This isthe first good defensive line to which they can now retire and they will no doubttry to make a stand here. Further south they will probably try to hold the lineZaporozhe-Melitopol in order to protect the Crimea, although&apos;the country heredoes not lend itself to defensive fighting.Burma.36.   There has been no activity to report in Arakan.On the Chindwin front one of our patrols at Thaungdut (30 miles north-east of Tamu) encountered a mixed Japanese-Burman party on the 6th. Some13 casualties were inflicted on the party without loss to ourselves.South-West Pacific Area.Nezv Guinea.37. On the 11th, Australian and United States troops captured Salamauaairfield, the town and Isthmus of Salamaua, and Kela village (2 miles north of thetown).   The Japanese still hold the high ground north-west of the town.The Australian forces which landed about 15 miles east of Lae on the 4thhave advanced, with artillery support, across the Busu River to positions about miles east of the town. They are shelling Japanese positions near- the airfields3 miles north-east and half a mile west of Lae. A Japanese counter-attack in theBusu River area has been beaten off.The Australian and United States troops advancing from the west down theMarkham Valley have been in contact with the Japanese 6 miles north-west ofLae and are reported to have driven them from prepared positions in this area.Solomons.38. Japanese forces are still resisting on the east coast.- of Vella Lavella.Fighting also continues in the north of Arundel Island, one of the small island;:between New Georgia and Kolombangara.AIR SITUATION.General Review.39. Heavy daylight attacks were made on airfields in Northern France, onthe Boulogne defences and on industrial targets in Paris. At night, a factory at Montlucon, near Vichy, was heavily bombed.In Italy, roads, bridges and railways on the approaches to the Salerno Gulfarea were heavily attacked.   Allied fighters patrolled the battle area.
United Kingdom.40. In. daylight. 10 enemy aircraft carried oat reconnaissance flights oversouth-west England; two of these were destroyed. On the night of the 15th/16th,17 enemy aircraft, three of which penetrated to the London area, flew over thesouth-eastern counties; four of them were shot down by Mosquito night-fighters.Home Waters.41. Aircraft of Fighter Command attacked enemy shipping oil the Frenchand Dutch coasts; one E/R boat, two small coasters and one large barge were sunk, and an armed auxiliary vessel, seven coasters, 13 tugs, three E/R boats and several other small craft were damaged.   Four aircraft are missing.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.The following targets were attacked :-Date.I Attacked    TonnageAircraft Despatched, \ Primary I       of Missing.   Results.Target.

Allied fighters flew 4,522 sorties during the week, including 1,703 on the 9th,when the enemy made little attempt to engage our aircraft. Forty-seven enemy aircraft were destroyed, 11 were probably destroyed and 23 were damaged, forthe loss of 13 fighters.Night.43. Owing to adverse weather conditions, only one large-scale operation was undertaken by aircraft of Bomber Command, the target being the MontluconRubber Tyre Factory, 49 miles N.W. of Vichy. Out of 374 aircraft despatched,including five U.S. Fortresses (B. 17), 352 attacked the target, dropping 1,021tons of bombs. Owing to cloud, the crews were not able to assess results accurately,but the pilots of two Spitfires which flew over the target on the following dayreported that the factory was extensively damaged and was burning fiercely,emitting black smoke which was visible 20 miles away. Three bombers are missing.Eight Lancasters with an escort of six Mosquitoes of Fighter Command were despatched to attack the Dortmund-Ems Canal at Greven (10 miles N. ofMunster). Two Lancasters attacked the target but observed no breach in the embankment.  Five Lancasters are missing.Mosquitoes made small-scale attacks on Berlin, Cologne, Duisburg, Dussel-dorf, Munchen-Gladbach, Emden and Borkum. A total of 65 Intruders attackedairfields and railway targets in Northern France and 12 Wellingtons droppedleaflets on several towns in France; three aircraft are missing.Italy.44. On the night of the landing of the Fifth Army in the Gulf of Salerno the 8th/9th September - Wellingtons concentrated their bombing on Eboli and therailway centre at Battipaglia, and 112 other aircraft attacked roads leading tothe beaches.  Night-fighters destroyed six enemy aircraft.On the day following, bombers in strength effectively attacked road junctions,bridges and railways on the approaches to the Naples-Salerno area.Fortresses (B. 17) dropped a total of over 350 tons of bombs at Capua (18 miles .N.W. of Naples) and Cancello (11 miles N.N.E. of Naples); at the former, bothroad bridges were broken by direct hits, the south bridge was almost destroyed, therailway bridge was holed in the centre and hits were made on the tracks at bothends of the bridge. Potenza (82 miles E.S.E. of Naples) was bombed by112 Mitchells (B. 25), resulting in direct hits on four tunnel entrances, the throughlines being blocked at both ends of the station and the main motor road effectivelycut. The beaches at Salerno were patrolled by 288 Spitfires, 309 Lightnings (P. 38)and 199 Mustangs (A. 36/P. 51), in support of our invasion forces; four enemy aircraft were destroyed and 10 Allied fighters are missing.Roads, road junctions, bridges and bottle-necks continued to be the main objectives of our heavy, medium and light bombers by day and by night. A largenumber of individual attacks was carried out, and some of the principal targets were Isernia, (52 miles N. of Naples), Cassino (50 miles N.W. of Naples), Formia(three miles N.E. of Gaeta), Mignano (24 miles E.N.E. of Gaeta), Ariana Iperno(47 miles&apos;E.N.E. of Naples), Torre Del Greco (six miles S.E. of Naples), Benevento,Potenza, Auletta (20 miles W.SW. of Potenza), Castelnuovo (26 miles N.W. ofSapri) and Pescara (95 miles E.N.E. of Rome). The attack on Castelnuovo couldbe taken as an example of the effectiveness of these raids. In that instance, alarge concentration of craters was seen at the road junction and at least 60 hitsdestroyed the roads leading north, south and east for lengths of approximately250 yards from the junction. Attacks on enemy airfields were not numerous, butraids were made on Frosinone (45 miles E.S.E. of Rome), Grazzanise (N. ofNaples), and on two satellite landing-grounds of Foggia.Fighters and fighter-bombers effectively attacked movement on the roads tothe north of the Eighth Army and on roads leading to the assault area; over300 vehicles were destroyed and a great number was damaged.On the 14th, our bomber effort was on a maximum scale and was directed inclose support of the land forces; targets were cross roads, junctions and defilesleading to the Salerno battle field, and a great weight of bombs was dropped onBattinaglia, Eboli and the Salerno area. These attacks encountered very little opposition and are believed to have been very effective.Our fighters patrolled the battle area, flying 700 to 800 sorties each day; on some days landing facilities were available at Montecorvino airfield and a landingstrip was also in operation on the beaches.    Enemy fighter-bomber opposition
against our landing forces was not in excess of 100 sorties per day and diminishedlater in the week. Casualties in combat were not heavy and little opposition was encountered by our heavy and medium bombers. Determined attacks, with bothbombs and torpedoes, were launched against our shipping.Mediterranean.Dodecanese.45. A total of 38 Liberators (B. 24) attacked the airfields of Calato andMaritza on the Island of Rhodes. Workshops and living quarters were hit and approximately six aircraft were destroyed on the ground.Russia.46. In the Don basin, the Russian Air Force heavily bombed the Germanlines of retreat by day and night and claims to have damaged many troop trains,engines and M/T. German airfields were attacked by day and many aircraft are stated to have been destroyed on the ground. At night, the main objectives were the stations of Krasnoarmeiskoye and Volnovakha (30 miles south ofStalino). which were attacked on the 7th/8th September, and Krasnograd, whichwas attacked on the lOth/llth.Elsewhere on the front, in the Priluki, Njedjin, Bryansk and Smolenskdirections the Russian Air Force was chiefly engaged in direct support of ground forces. In addition, raids were made at night on German troop concentrationsand supplies south-east of Smolensk and south-west of Sumi.Other objectives in the night bombing operations wrere the railway junctionsof Gomei and Njedjin, which were each raided during the week.Burma.47. F.enemy communications were again the principal target, especially in upper Burma and the Ramree area and on the Irrawaddy River. Severallocomotives and numerous railway trucks were damaged and a large number ofriver craft was sunk or damaged.The Gokteik viaduct near Mandalay was attacked four times by Mitchells(B. 25) which dropped 40 tons of bombs; hits were made on the base of the viaductand on the approaches. Shipping at Rangoon was attacked by Liberators (B. 24)which dropped 50 tons, causing damage to four medium size ships.Among other targets attacked were barracks at Lashio and Lonkin (256 miles . of Mandalay), oil installations in the Chauk and Yenangyaung area (120 miles.W. of Mandalay) and enemy positions in the Akyab area.China.48. Thirty-eight Allied medium and fighter-bombers attacked the docks at hankow and cotton mills and warehouses at Wuchang (nine miles S. of Hankow).Several large fires were started in the docks and many hits were scored on thecctton mills.Lightnings (P. 38) bombed the Whampoa Docks at Canton and the harbour at Hong Kong; one ship was sunk and another was damaged. Other fighter-bombers sank two tugs at Hukow, damaged a medium size ship at Kiukiang(110 miles S.E. of Hankow), and successfully bombed shipping and railways atShinhweiyao (60 miles S.E. of Hankow).Pacific Zone.New Guinea.49. Allied aircraft gave full support to our land forces in the Lae andSalamaua areas. Our air superiority was such that the enemy was not able to reinforce his troops either by sea or air.

APPENDIX  YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week:  Germany.Mannheim. Further   photographs   taken   on   the  9th   September,   show considerable damage to business and residential property in the most closelybuilt-up areas of both Mannheim and Ludwigshafen, while many streets betweenMannheim main railway station and the river have been devastated.In addition to the industrial damage previously reported, several factories and transport targets have been hit, including (i) Industrial.Heinrich Lanz A.G. (Artillery tractors, tank components). considerable further damage to shops.Raschig G.m.b.F . (Chemical products).   Several buildings burnt out.Sulzer Bros. (Diesel engines for warships).   Severe damage to shops.Several unidentified factories.   Variously damaged.(ii) 7&apos;ransportation.Ludwigshafen railway repair shops. Several shops gutted, one engineroundhouse destroyed and one damaged.   Many sheds destroyed.Mannheim Hauptbahnhof. Main building gutted, many sheds destroyed.Ludwigshafen Hauptbahnhof. Main buildings gutted. Goods stationbuildiners gutted.(iii) Public Buildings.Ludwigshafen gas works.   Several buildings gutted.Main post office.   Largely gutted.Offenburg. -This was among the targets of opportunity attacked by theU.S.A.A F. on the 6th September when bad weather conditions prevented thegreater part of the force from bombing the primary large:....... &apos;futtgart.   It is now known that the railway sidings in Offenburg were severely damaged, and that allrail traffic between Basle ancl the Rhineland had to be diverted over the Colrnar-Strassburg line and was still using this route on the 10th.September. In additionall telephone ancl telegraph communications between the German railway station at Basle and Offenburg, Karlsruhe. Mannheim ancl Stuttgart were severed untilthe day after the attack.Hamburg. A final interpretation of photographs confirms that damage and destruction is on a scale far beyond anything yet achieved in aerial attack.Thousands of acres, especially in the east, can be seen in which every building in every street has been demolished or left roofless and gutted. Some impression of the total effect upon this, the second largest city in Germany, can be gaugedfrom the following facts : -(i) Over 77 per cent, of the fully built-up area has been destroyed or damaged.(ii) All the four main shipbuilding yards and the M.A.N. diesel engineworks have been damaged.(iii) In the dock area five floating docks have been sunk or damaged,together with numerous ships in the harbour, of which 12 are over200 feet. An example of the damage to warehouses and storagebuildings is seen in the Baaken harbour where every warehouse on one quay for a distance of about a mile is burnt out and on anotherquay for two-thircls of a mile.(iv) Dislocation to rail communications can be gauged by the fact that aburnt-out train seen to be stationary on a damaged bridge over theBillhafen was still in the same position 10 days later.(v) In the town 150 industrial premises have been destroyed or damaged.(vi) The two important power stations at Neuhof and Tiefstack appear tohave been inactive since the attacks. Two other power stations inthe town were seriously damaged and two very large gas holders atthe main gas works in Grasbrook are burnt out.
France.Amiens/Longueau. Photographs taken on the 7th September, after two attacks on the marshalling yards show severe damage to tracks, rolling-stock and storage yards. A building in the railway workshops was destroyed and the bridge and viaduct carrying the high-level tracks over the low-level tracks has been damaged by at least three near hits.Rouen I Sotteville. Photographs taken on the 6th September, show that in the attack by the LJ.S.A.A.F. considerable damage was caused in the sorting sidingswhere tracks were cut and wagons destroyed. The locomotive repair shops sufferedsome damage and the north-west end of the engine shed and workshops has been severely damaged.lieauvais/Tille. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the3rd and 9th September, show two aircraft shelters destroyed and three damagedseverely.
