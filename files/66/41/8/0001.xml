I circulate these two documents to my colleagues herewith (Annexes Aand B), together with a further telegram (Annex C) from the State Departmentto Mr. Winant, which I received from the latter on the 20th September.A. E.Foreign Office, 21st September, 1943.ANNEX A.Message from the United States Government, communicated by the United StatesAmbassador.London, l$th September, 1943.THE State Department, in collaboration with the War and Navy Depart-ments, has for some time been considering the desirability of an approach to theIrish Government on the question of Naval and Air bases in Ireland. It is nowproposed that a personal message be sent by the President to Prime MinisterDe Valera on this subject. In considering this matter we have kept constantlyin mind the fact that, aside from other considerations, Ireland.is at the backdoor of Great Britain and that happenings inside Ireland are of mofe immediateand more direct interest to Great Britain than to the United States^ An approachby the United States might possibly be received more sympathetically than asimilar approach by the British Government. In view of Britain &apos;s immediateinterest, however, we desire to take no step in relation to this matter which doesnot have the full approval of the British authorities. We have assumed that anyNaval and Air facilities obtained in Ireland would be available also to Britishforces, but we believe it wise in our initial approach to the Irish authorities todbe silent on this point. It is understood that the President and Prime^Minister Churchill have discussed this question and are in agreement that anapproach to the Irish authorities is desirable at this time. Before proceedingwith the matter, however, we desire that the form of our proposed approach beconsidered and approved by the authorities in London. Will you therefore takethis question up with Eden at once and request the views of the British Govern-ment on the proposed message from the President to Prime Minister De Valera.We believe that the time is now ripe to make an approach of this kind, and wehope that the British Government will give us its views as soon as possible.12154 [26108]
ANNEX B. .; &apos;Draft of proposed Message from President Roosevelt to Prime Ministerde Valera.FROM the outbreak of war in September 1939 I have watched the effortsof the various smaller neutral nations of Europe to remain aloof from the conflictraging about them even when fully aware that their very existence was threatened.These nations still hesitated to join their strength to the forces resisting Axisaggression. They hoped that by refraining from measures of self-protectionor of assistance to their friends they might be spared. In trying so desperately \to escape attack they have actually assisted the Axis forces in overrunning theirlands. Thus they fell easy prey to Axis duplicity and were swallowed up oneafter the other without an opportunity for concerted resistance. Ireland has sofar escaped this unhappy fate of these other small &quot; neutral &quot; nations only becausepowerful armed resistance has stood in the conquerer&apos;s path. I recall that shortlyafter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the German and Italiandeclarations of war against the United States, you made a speech describing theintimate ties which bind our two countries and affirming the friendly sentimentsof Ireland toward the United States in the war. In this speech of the14th December, 1941, you stated : &quot; Since this terrible war began our sympathieshave gone out to all the suffering peoples who have been dragged into it. Further,hundreds of millions have become involved since I spoke at Limerick a fortnightago. Its extension to the United States of America brings a source of anxietyand sorrow to every part of this land. There is scarcely a family here which hasnot a member or near relative in that country. In addition to the ties of bloodthere has been between our two nations a long association of friendship andregard continuing uninterruptedly from America&apos;s own struggle for independencedown to our own. The part that American friendship played in helping us towin the freedom that we enjoy in this part of Ireland has been gratefullyrecognized and acknowledged by our people. It would be unnatural then if wedid not sympathize in a special manner with the people of the United Statesand if we did not feel with them in all the anxieties and trials which this warmust bring upon them. For this reason strangers who do not understand ourconditions have begun to ask how Americans entry into the war will affect ourState policy. Here we answered that question in advance. The policy of theState remains unchanged. We can only be a friendly neutral.&quot; You were goodenough to have excerpts from your speech transmitted to me through the IrishMinister in Washington. I replied to you at that time as follows : &quot; I havereceived through Mr. Brennan, the Irish Minister in Washington, certain extractsfrom your speech delivered at Cork on the 14th December. I note with particularinterest your reference to the long association of friendship and regard betweenour two countries, your expressions of sympathy with the people of the UnitedStates in the present conflict, and your declaration of friendly neutrality on thepart of the Irish Government. I fully understand the strong desire of Irelandand the desire of every nation not at war to avoid active participation in thepresent struggle. Unfortunately, as the experience of so many nations, includingour own, has so clearly demonstrated, the desire to avoid the wave of conquestprovides little guarantee of national safety. On the contrary, it merely givesto the aggressor the opportunity to choose the moment and manner of attack,sometimes carried out most treacherously. I cannot let this opportunity passwithout repeating what has now become the obvious: namely, that Axisaggression is now being waged on a worldwide scale, that until this aggressionhas been stopped by force of arms there is no security for any nation great orsmall. These are stern facts which the Irish people may well ponder today, andI feel that the American Government would be failing in its duty of deep friend- . jship if it did not with the wisdom of its recent experience underline their vitarsignificance to the Irish Government. We do not minimize the task before us,but I need scarcely tell you of the absolute confidence of the American Govern-&apos;ment and the American people in the final triumph of the cause for which weare now fighting and our determination to carry the fight through to completevictory. Happily the vast majority of mankind and the preponderance ofresources are on our side. The assistance which any nation or any people maygive in this struggle merely speeds the day of victory and peace and securityfor all nations. Your expressions of gratitude for the long interest of the UnitedStates in Irish freedom are appreciated. The policy of the American Govern-ment now, as in the past, contemplates the hope that all the free institutions,
liberties and independence which the Irish people now enjoy may be preservedfor the full enjoyment of the future. If freedom and liberty are to be preservedthey must now be defended by the human and material resources of all.freenations. Your freedom, too, is at stake. No longer can it be doubted that thepolicy of Hitler and his Axis associates is the conquest of the entire world andthe enslavement of all mankind. I have every confidence that the Irish Govern-ment and the Irish people, who love liberty and freedom as dearly as we, willknow how to meet their responsibilities in the present situation.&quot; Although theIrish Government in the intervening months has in certain ways demonstratedits friendship for the United States, the fact is that we have done far more for/&quot;Ireland since the outbreak of war than Ireland has done in return.In the summer of 1940, when Ireland was virtually unarmed and in deadlyperil of German aggression, 20,000 American rifles were supplied to the IrishArmy. The American Government was unable to provide more only because wetoo were unarmed and were building up our own armament, and because we were,in addition, providing arms and war supplies to those nations which wereactively defending themselves against aggression. More recently the American.Red Cross, with the approval of the American Government, has undertaken tosend 1500,000 worth of medical supplies to Ireland. Part of these supplies havealready been shipped. Not only arms and medical and other supplies have beenprovided Ireland from the United States. The American Government inSeptember 1941, in the face of a growing world shipping shortage, madeavailable to the Irish Government by charter two American merchant ships toenable the Irish Government and Irish people to carry to their shores foodstuffsand other supplies of critical necessity. The chartering of these ships to theIrish Government represented a real sacrifice on the part of this country at a timewhen shipping space was most badly needed. In making this sacrifice we weremotivated by the most friendly considerations and-by the sole purpose of helpingto prevent suffering and deprivation among the Irish people. Let us contrastAmerican help to Ireland with the Axis contribution to Irish welfare duringthe present war. Germany has bombed Irish cities and destroyed Irish lives andproperty with impunity. A German plane has sunk a ship carrying a cargo ofAmerican wheat to Ireland, and Axis submarines have sunk other ships carryingsupplies to Ireland. Both of the two ships chartered to Ireland by the UnitedStates and sailing under the Irish flag have been sunk by Axis submarines. Theloss of these ships harms not only Ireland but the United States to whom thevessels belonged and the whole United Nations war effort.I believe it is now time therefore for Ireland to consider what steps itcan take to be of assistance to the United States and the United Nations inbringing the Axis aggressors to their already certain defeat. I am informedby our highest military and naval experts that it would be helpful to us at thisstage in planning our war strategy to know that Naval and Air bases in Irelandwould be available to American forces in the event such facilities should be needed.In the opinion of American experts the use of such facilities would in certaincontingencies help to save American lives and the lives of nationals of thosecountries associated with us in the war. As you say, there is scarcely a family inIreland that does not have a member or a near relative in the United States.These Americans of Irish blood and background are loyal American citizens andare making their full contribution to the war in every way. Here at home theyare supporting the war effort as loyally as any section of the American population.They are contributing their full share of fighting men for duty in the armedforces overseas. Fighting with these American soldiers of Irish blood as comradesin arms are many tens of thousands of other Irishmen from Great Britain andother countries of the British Commonwealth and including Ireland itself. Theopportunity to help save the lives of these men and of all those fighting with them^ must surely strike a sympathetic chord in the hearts of the people of IrelandY^o-nd, indeed, of all Irishmen everywhere.I therefore ask in the name of the Government of the United States and onbehalf of the American armed forces that the Irish Government now agree togrant to the United States, for the duration of the war and six months thereafter,permission to use existing air and naval facilities in Ireland at any time thesefacilities should be required, and also permission to establish and use such othernaval and air facilities as may be needed by American forces. I give you the solemnassurance of the Government of the United States that American forces willevacuate Irish soil at the end of the war and that the bases will be returned tothe Irish Government. It is entirely possible that Irish bases may not be needed.Further progress of the war may soon render bases in Ireland of little or no
military value to us. In such event we would, of course, not exercise the permissionwhich I now ask to use Irish bases. Nevertheless, it would be of real assistance tous now in planning our war strategy to be able to count upon the use of such basesif they should be needed. Whether American forces actually use these bases ornot, Ireland would have the satisfaction of having made available tp-us^suctrqf- its^cilities as we may need to help bring the war to an end as speedily as possible&apos; and with the least possible loss of life. An agreement on the part of the IrishGovernment to the foregoing effect would for military reasons be kept strictlysecret. AThe Irish Government, which has thus far remained strictly neutral,may be tempted to believe that since the United Nations will win the war in anyevent IrelancTs freedom is therefore amply assured whether or not Ireland offersany contribution to victory. Even if the Irish Government were inclined to pursue .such a course, I frankly do not believe that it would be in Ireland&apos;s interest todo so. An agreement to place Irish naval and airbase facilities at the disposalof the American Government, to be used only in the event these facilities areneeded, would constitute an historic step in associating Ireland with its traditionalfriends and in ranging Ireland on the side of right and justice and victory inthis greatest struggle of all history. These considerations lead me to hope thatyour Government will make a favorable reply at an early date.ANNEX C.Telegram from the Department of State to the United States Ambassador.I WISH to refer to my telegram sent to you earlier to-day concerning thequestion of naval and air bases in Ireland. We understand that there has beenforwarded by the President to the British Government a copy of a draft note tothe Irish Government prepared by Mr. Gray, our Minister in Dublin, during hisrecent visit in the United States. The message set forth in my telegram ofto-day&apos;s date, which might be used in place of the earlier draft, has been approvedby the President. In his opinion, some parts of the former draft might possiblybe incorporated in this new draft, although he does not have any strong views inthat respect. In our opinion, the new draft message would entirely meet thesituation. If the British Government has any suggestions, we shall of course beglad to receive them. The United States Joint Chiefs of Staff have also approvedthis new draft.
