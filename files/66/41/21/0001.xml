THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENTofPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET./Copy No. 33W.P. (43) 421.27th September. 1943.WAR CABINET.dg-Terin:rearmament.Il&apos;wfial.GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.BEFORE leaving for Moscow I would like to have the views of my colleagues on the future of Germany. I feel that at the forthcoming meeting of foreign ministers I should be able to represent the present broad views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, which would, of course, be subject to reconsideration in the light ofany alternative proposals put forward by the United States or Soviet Governments.2. There is a choice between three possible long-term policies in dealingwith Germany :  (1)(2)(3)The policy of total and immediate reconciliation;The policy of total and permanent repression; andAn intermediate policy containing severe or very severe elements ofrepression, but aiming ultimately at the re-admittance of Germany onan equal footing into the life of Europe.3. I suggest that the only policy holding out any real hope for the future isone which, while taking all necessary safeguards, aims ultimately at there-admittance of a reformed Germany into the life of Europe.4. But the cure of Germany will take many years and we must be preparedto enforce our minimum necessary repressive measures for a long time.5. The first line of defence against a repetition of German aggression mustbe the disarmament of Germany and the prevention of her re-armament.Additional measures will, however, be necessary to insure against the danger thatour will to keep Germany disarmed may weaken with the passage of time. these measures fall under three headings : political, territorial and economic.6. The most drastic action would be dismemberment, i.e., the destructionof Germany as a political entity by splitting her up into separate States. I myselfam not opposed to such a course, but strong political control over a very long-period would be necessary to prevent the re-union of the various units. Nor is there any guarantee that such control would in the long run prove effective, since,apart from the centripetal forces which are likely to be at work in Germany, wemust expect a gradual weakening in the Allied determination to oppose suchreunion.7. A less drastic solution would be decentralisation, i.e., reorganisation ona federal or confederal basis. This would be not out of harmony with Germany&apos;straditions and it might offer the best prospect of developing a stable democraticregime in Germany. After the last war strong separatist and particularistmovements manifested themselves. In the conditions of chaos which may exist in Germany after this war and especially if for a time no stable Central Govern-meht emerges, regions will probably be thrown very much on their own resources.We might use this to lay the foundations of a more decentralised political system.8. I suggest, however, more especially in view of the proposal inparagraph 14 below, that it is unnecessary for us to make up our minds on this very &quot;difficult question at the present stage.9. I think it will be agreed that Germany must in the first place revert toher pve-AnscJduss boundaries.   To ensure &quot;freedom from fear&quot; throughout12160   [26140]
Upper Silesia,East Prussiaami the rhineland.Economic.Europe, the surrender of certain territory which is now substantially Germanin character and population will also be necessary. Even though accompaniedby the transfer of populations, this will, of course, arouse irredentist feeling among the German people.10. The three areas which come mainly in question are Upper Silesia, east prussia and the Rhineland. The cession to Poland of Upper Silesia, accompaniedby large-scale transfers of population, would benefit our Polish Allies and depriveGermany of rich industrial areas. The cession of East Prussia, with Danzig, to poland is necessary on strategic grounds and in order to compensate Poland forher probable losses in the east. Although it might be strategically desirable that the territory on the left bank of the Rhine should be ceded to France, it is not certain that the French nation will be able and willing after this war to shoulderthe responsibility involved. Moreover, strategic control of the left bank of the rhine will not diminish Germanys power to make war unless steps are also takento transfer or at least control the vitally important part of her war potentialcentred on the right bank in the Ruhr-Rhineland area, which neither France.Holland nor Belgium would wish to take over. The solution, therefore, wouldseem to lie not in the separation of the Rhineland from the Reich but in a formof direct control of German economic war potential.11. This third method of reinsurance (control of economic potential) isunder examination, but sufficient progress has not yet been made for me to makeany concrete recommendation to my colleagues. I submit, however, that, if weare to exercise any direct and effective control, we must have (a) some inter-Alliedagreement, (b) some Central German administration (not necessarily a Govern-ment), and (c) some means of machine in accordance with our wishesensuringthe functioning of the German economicShould there be a CentralGovernmentor not?If not, should we administerGermanyourselves?12. Irrespective of the above considerations, the first pressing politicalproblem will be whether or not to recognise any Central German Governmentwhich may succeed to the Nazi regime immediately before or after the conclusionof hostilities. There are manifest advantages in having a Central Governmentto sign an armistice, to see that its provisions are carried out and to maintainlaw and order throughout the country. None the less, in the absence of potentialdemocratic leaders after ten years of Nazi repression, any such Government could probably only be representative of the old Germany and might well ensure thesurvival of those very elements of militarism which it is our fundamental aim to destroy. Moreover, the recognition of a Central German Government would makeit more difficult to dismember Germany or to encourage separatist tendencies, fwould accordingly ask my colleagues to authorise me to take the line that it may prove undesirable to recognise a Central Government in Germany, anyhow duringthe early months after the conclusion of hostilities. This would give us time totake stock of the position and possibly to shape developments. It would not exclude the signature of a purely military armistice with the German high command.13. The absence of a Central Government would probably make the totaloccupation of Germany inevitable or at least highly desirable for a period. It isin any case essential to agree in advance on some kind of co-ordinating machinery,with the object of bringing the policy of the three major Allies into line, and ofcoping with the policing and administrative problems which will arise in theconfused conditions when the fighting ends. It might be well to place it under a supreme Allied Commander for Germany, at any rate in the initial stage. Underthe Supreme Commander would also come the various Allied Commanders whowould be responsible for law and order in their respective zones.14. The co-ordinating body referred to above would in fact, if not in name,temporarily assume sovereign power in Germany. Eventually, it might developinto a kind of High Commission, consisting of civilian representatives of the three major Powers and possibly also of France, together with representatives of the minor Allies. It might be charged with the detailed execution of all the economicand other non-military terms of surrender which we might jointly decide to impose upon the enemy. In addition, it would have to carry out any directives it may receive from a United Nations Commission for Europe, if such is established (seeparagraph 4 (?) of W.P. (43) 217), which in its turn might be subordinate to someworld-wide authority. This kind of regime might continue until such a time asthe Allies are agreed on their policy towards Germany.
I conclusions. 15.   To sura up, I would ask my colleagues for authority to discuss the futureof Germany at the forthcoming meeting of Foreign Ministers on the following lines : (a) As regards the political future of Germany, His Majesty&apos;s government still have an open mind as between (i) a unitary Germany under a central Government, (ii) a decentralised administration on a federalor confederal basis or (iii) the splitting up of Germany into a numberof separate States. We should, however, do all in our power toencourage separatist and particularist movements in Germany.(b) It may well be undesirable to recognise any Central German Governmentof whatever political complexion, anyhow during the early monthsafter the conclusion of hostilities.(c) Whether or not a Central German Government exists, Germany should infact be administered for a period, possibly as long as two years, by an inter-Allied body deriving its authority ultimately from a world-widebody and, if such is constituted, more directly from a United nations commission for Europe.(d) Total occupation of Germany by the three major Allies, possibly with assistance from France and the minor Allies, in accordance with ascheme to be agreed upon by the experts of the three countries.(e) Total disarmament of Germany.(/) Germany should revert to her pre-Anschluss frontiers. This wouldmean : (T) restoration of a free and independent Austria, possiblyconnected with some central European confederation; (2) restorationof Czechoslovakia, possibly with minor agreed frontier rectificationsin the Eger triangle; (3) restoration of pre-war territorial status quoin the Low Countries and Luxemburg; (4) restoration to France of alsace-Lorraine; (5) return of the Memelland to Lithuania (whetherindependent or a federated republic of the U.S.S..R..)(g) In addition, the cession to Poland of East Prussia. Danzig and considerable areas of Silesia, including the Oppeln district, and consequent transfers of German populations.(h) Transfer (if desired) of control of the Kiel Canal to the United Nations.(i) Imposition on Germany of some form of international control of herindustry and economic life.I think the time has now come, if my colleagues agree with the main linesof this paper, when the Dominion Prime Ministers should be informed of thedirection in which our minds are moving.A.
