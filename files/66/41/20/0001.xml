THIS document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET. Copy No.   3 3W.P. (*3) 420.27th September, 1943.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS TURKEY.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.FOR 200 years, with the exception of one brief interval, the integrity ofTurkey has been a principle of British foreign policy. At the same time, Turkishcontrol of the Straits, together with definite limitations on the use of this lineof communications by men-o&apos;-war has been regarded as of equal importance.2. In 1939, after the seizure of Albania, when German or Italian aggression against other Balkan States and even Turkey herself seemed imminent, we andthe French concluded with Turkey a tripartite treaty of mutual assistance toprovide for the various eventualities which might occur. It was hoped that this treaty would be supplemented by one between Turkey and the Soviet Union.As events turned out, the second treaty was never concluded, and, indeed, in thebrief period during which the German-Soviet Pact of Non-Aggression held, the tripartite Treaty was in fact, if not of design, directed as much against SovietRussia as against any other would be aggressor in the Balkans.3. When, however, Germany attacked the Soviet Union and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Soviet Government concluded a solemn agreement on the13th July, 1941, it became at once apparent that there was no conflict betweenthe Turco-British alliance and the close relations amounting to alliance existing between Great Britain and the Soviet Union. Indeed, in order to clarify theposition, it was possible for the British and Soviet Ambassadors at Angora tomake formal and written assurances to the Turkish Government in identicalterms that their Governments remained faithful to the Montreux Conventiongoverning the regime of the Straits and had no aggressive intention or claim on them. Each Government further declared that they were ready to observescrupulously the territorial integrity of the Turkish Republic. The british ambassador, with the full knowledge of the Soviet Government, further reaffirmedHis Majesty&apos;s Government^ obligations to Turkey under the first article of the tripartite Treaty, to give the Turks assistance in the event of aggression. Somesimilar assurances were given again at the time of the signature of the Anglo-Soviet Alliance in May 1942.4. British short-term policy in Turkey is now directed to bringing thatcountry into the war or persuading her to grant us certain facilities at the momentappropriate to our strategy in the Eastern Mediterranean. To this end we have,in conjunction with the Turkish Military Authorities, embarked on a programmeof aerodrome and base construction work. We have further been supplying the-Turkish armed forces with all the equipment they can absorb and we oan spare,in order that Turkey, when the time comes, may carry out her obligations underthe Treaty, which by mutual consent have hitherto been waived.5- From reports which I have seen of conversations between the SovietGovernment and the Turkish Ambassador in Moscow and between the soviet ambassador in Angora and the Turkish Government, as well as from articlesm the Russian press, it is apparent that the Soviet Government is dissatisfied with the present Turkish attitude of neutrality, which they consider is now ofexclusive benefit to the enemy, whatever it may have been in the past. The SovietGovernment have even gone so far as to say that their attitude towards Turkeywill be governed by the attitude of that country towards Germany. There are12159   [26135]
indications that the Soviet Government views with disfavour certain reportsthat Turkey wishes to intervene in the Balkans should that area fall into anarchyfollowing German withdrawal. There are also signs of a misunderstandingregarding the object of our supplies of arms to Turkey, amounting even tosuspicion that these are not being given to Turkey for use against Germany,but for ultimate use against the Soviet Union.6. There is, as far as .1 am aware, no conflict between the long-term interestsof Great Britain and the Soviet Union as regards Turkish territorial integrityor the Straits. There is, however, some misunderstanding as regards immediatepolicy. Both His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Soviet Government desire parti-cipation in the war by Turkey on the side of the United Nations in some form orother. The only difference being that the Soviet Government desire immediateparticipation and we, for military reasons, participation at a later date. Asregards supplies of war material, these are being supplied to Turkey to enable her to play her part in the war against the Germans and not to strengthen heragainst imaginary aggressive intentions by the Soviet Union. This has been madesignificantly clear in the draft lease-lend agreement which will shortly be presented to the Turkish Government. If when the time comes for us to ask Turkey to fulfil her obligation under the Treaty she fails to do so. there will, of course, bean immediate cessation of these military supplies. As regards Turkish inter-vention in the Balkans, His Majesty&apos;s Government has no interest in Turkishintervention once German troops have withdrawn from the area, though they,and I am sure the Soviet Government as well, would warmly welcome any help the Turkish Government could give us to clear the enemy out of those parts.7. The question of our relations with Turkey will almost inevitably bediscussed at the forthcoming Foreign Ministers&apos; Conference, and I propose to speak to the Soviet Government on the lines indicated in the preceding paragraph.I shall be grateful for the approval of my colleagues in this course a. E.&apos;Foreign Office,27th September, 1943.
