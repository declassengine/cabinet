(43) 436.4/// October. 1943.WAR CABINET.NOTE OF DISSENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. I am in complete disagreement with the recommendations of the india committee.    *2. I regard them as being in essence an instruction to Lord Wavell that,if and when he thinks the occasion suitable (with the implication that he is towork towards creating a suitable occasion), he is free to ask the War cabinet for permission to invite tlje main Indian political leaders, including Gandhi andNehru, to a secret round-table conference in Viceroy&apos;s House to discuss the[26188]
question of their participation in the Viceroy&apos;s Council. It is to be understoodthat when this happens the Cabinet can object only on the ground that the moment is inopportune.3. I note that the political leaders will be required to declare in advance that they will be whole-heartedly behind the war effort, and that, in anyconsideration that may be given to the future constitution of India, they acceptthe principle that it must be an agreed one. But the fact of the invitation andthe substance of the discussions are bound to become public with the result that ghandi will have, at a stroke, reinstated himself in a position where he is ableto discuss with the Viceroy on equal terms and is once more one of two equal kingsin Brentford. The effect upon our friends in India, including the sepoy, the minorofficial and the police, will be little short of calamitous.4. There is. too. the worse possibility that Gandhi should once more directhis nominees to take office with the intention of using their new position tosubvert British control and to hinder the war effort. With all the demands on india which will be made by the South-East Asia Command there will be abundantopportunities, and Gandhi can be relied upon to use them with consummate skill and ingenuity.5. I am ready to enlarge upon my views in discussion. I boil them down tothis brief summary.6. We have made a most generous offer to India. It has been rejectedmainly at the instance of Gandhi. In the process of rejection Gandhi made itclear that in no circumstances would he help in the war against Japan, and thathe would not. in fact, be a party to active resistance against a Japanese invasionat all. But his doctrine of non-violence did not prevent him from instigating a violent rebellion against the British at a time when India was in great peril fromthe Japanese. He was consequently locked up with most of his importantfollowers. The British Government have said that, if he forswears activehostility to the war effort, he can be released, and that in the meantime the Crippsoffer stands. The responsibility is, therefore, with Gandhi. In my view it isclear that Gandhi has no intention of collaborating or, indeed, of ceasing fromhindering. If. therefore, the British Government take the initiative in invitinghim to collaborate, one of three results will follow.7. The first is that Gandhi will refuse to co-operate, in which case therewill be no more harm than that of causing great bewilderment in the minds of the friends ancl supporters of this country and great uncertainty ineverybody else&apos;s except that of Congress. In spite of our declarations, weshall once more have made advances to Congress and thrown over our friends. Alternatively, he will seek elucidations ancl start his usual courseof arguments. He is likely in that case very quickly to get the BritishGovernment into a false position where they will be forced to release himwithout his having forsworn his past. Again, great uncertainty and alarmwill have been caused to our friends ancl, what is more. Gandhi will be at large, free to plan rebellion again. Or, thirdly, he will accept the Viceroy&apos;invitation, in which case he will have the choice of two possible courses. He caneither work for a breakdown, but in such a way that the blame for it can be thrownupon the British Government or upon the Muslims. The other course, which is perhaps much the worse one, would be to patch up an agreement which he hasno intention of working except to his advantage and to the harm of this countryand India alike.8. My conclusion is that, after a study of the history of the last twenty-fiveyears, I have no doubt that a settlement in India is impossible so long as Gandhiis alive. When he is dead I believe that things will be very different, ancl I urge that the British Government will hasten rather than delay a solution of theirproblem if in the meantime they quite deliberately work to diminish Gandhi&apos;simportance and let the responsibility for breaking the present deadlock restsquarely upon him. Any other course will be fraught with the gravest detriment to the Allied war effort in the Far East.P. J. G.
