Some signs of impatience on the part ofthe press were shown towards the close of the conference, owing to the absence of1official information about what was happening behind the doors of the ChateauFrontenac, but many tributes to Air. Churchill and President Roosevelt appeared.Commenting on President Roosevelt&apos;s address in Ottawa, the Halifax Chronicleobserved : &quot; One could feei as he spoke that the major interests and outlooks ofthe United States ancl Canada are identical.&quot;2. The Liberal overthrow in Ontario, reported last month, has been closelyfollowed by further Liberal losses in four Federal by-elections. All four seats had previously been held by Liberals. The two Prairie seats went to the C.C.F., a communist (called by a different name, to circumvent the legal ban on theCommunist Party) was returned in Montreal, and a member of the BlocPopulaire Canadien, the Nationalist movement in Quebec, in a rural constituencyof Quebec. It is evident that these defeats for the Liberals are signs of some-thing more than mere public weariness with a party long in office, and the intro-duction and spectacular rise of a third party, the C.C.F., presages a profoundchange in Canadian politics. So far, the C.C.F. has made progress chiefly inthe mining and industrial districts, and it makes little headway in Quebec. Asexpected, Colonel George Drew has become Premier of Ontario. It is matter forconjecture whether his Conservative party and the Liberal &quot;rump&quot; will now make common cause in order to secure a majority against the vigorous C.C.F.Opposition.3. The success of the Bloc Populaire candidate in the Quebec Federalby-elections calls for comment. The party is isolationist, basing itself on a&apos;,&apos; Quebec first &quot; policy, and advocating less vigorous participator by Canada inthe war. French-Canadian Roman Catholic Priests took an active part in the bloc Populaire campaign, from which anti-Semitism was not absent.4. A serious strike, involving 20,000 workers, broke out during August incertain Montreal aircraft factories over the workers&apos; claim for retrospectiveapplication of the cost of living bonus. The Minister of Munitions and Supplypromptly closed the factories. Ten days later the men returned to work, on theunderstanding that their case should be resubmitted to the National War labour board.secret.P. (43) 417.23rd September, 1943.
5. The enquiry which lias been conducted during recent months by theNational War Labour Board has still not been published, and controversy has arisen meanwhile, owing to the fact that one of its members, Mr. J. L. Cohen,who is regarded as Labour&apos;s representative on the Board, has stated that he willnot continue to take part in controversial cases coming before the Labour Boarduntil the Government has made its policy clear.Naval, Military and Air Activities.6. His Majestys Canadian destroyer Athabaskan, in company with HisMajesty&apos;s sloop Egret, whilst forming part of an escort group on anti-submarinepatrol oh north-west coast of Spain, was attacked by Dornier aircraft and damaged. She reached port with a few survivors of the Egret. There were twokilled and fifteen wounded in Athabaskan.7. On the 7th August the hirst Canadian Division in Sicily, continuing their advance in company with the 78th Division, captured Adrano, on thesouthern slopes of Mount Etna, and then moving northwards along the roadfollowing the western base of the mountain, captured Bronte the following day.This operation ended the Sicilian campaign as far as the Canadians were con-cerned. for the Division was withdrawn from the 30th Corps and the forward area on the 10th August in order to train for the crossing of the Strait of Messinaand the invasion of the Italian Mainland three weeks later.8. R.C.A.F. squadrons active during August : In United Kingdom 29, Over-seas 5. No. 434 Squadron formed on Halifaxes and there was one other squadronforming. Bombing operations over Germany wrere more numerous than usual and included the series of attacks on Hamburg; R.C.A.F. bomber losses thereforeincreased, though other casualties showed little change; total losses were 53aircraft composed of 42 bombers, six fighters, two torpedo-bombers, one flying boat and two Intruder aircraft. Nine enemy aircraft were claimed as destroyed byR.C.A.F. squadrons during the month. The following are the principal incidentsconnected with individual R.C.A.F. squadrons:  Nos. 405. 408 and 426 have converted to Lancasters: No. 429 is convertingfrom Wellingtons to Flalifaxes. A Sunderland of No. 423 Squadron sank aU-boat from which 56 survivors were captured; the Sunderland was brought down, but the pilot and five crew were rescued together with the Germans..No. 419 Halifax Squadron flew 1.044 hours and No. 428 Halifax Squadron1.011 hours on bombing operations during the month, in addition to time spenton training.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.9. With interest continually stimulated by the rapidly unfolding drama ofevents in Europe, and their own Federal election, Australians have been morethan usually occupied with public affairs.10. Australia has long been anxious to see British influence stronglyre-established in the Pacific, and there was consequently a warm welcome for the assurance that British Forces would play a considerable part in the assault on japan.11. In home affairs, there is little doubt that Mr. Curtin would have preferred to see the passage of his social security legislation before the dissohi-tion of Parliament, but the Federal election, forced on him earlier than he wished, 1resulted in an overwhelming and quite unexpected victory for Labour, by whichhis own position has been immeasurably strengthened. Labour has now a clear majority, not only in the House of Representatives, but also in the Senate, a resultwhich even the most optimistic of Mr. Curtin&apos;s supporters would scarcely haveventured to predict. It is the first &quot; two-EIouse &quot; victory for Labour since 1914.According to the latest press reports, the final election results are Labour     ...      ...      ... ... ... ... 49United Australia Party ... ... ... 13Country Party    ...       ... ... ... ... 8Independent       ...       ... ... ... ... 1
thus giving Labour a clear majority of 27. All the 19 vacant seats in the Senatewent&quot; to Labour, who now hold 22 Senate seats against the Opposition^ 14.Miss Dorothy Tangney has been elected to the Senate and thus becomes the firstwoman to sit in the Federal Parliament, and Dame Enid Lyons, widow of theformer Prime Minister, becomes the second, as she has been elected to the Houseof Representatives for a Tasmanian constituency.12. In his own constituency, Mr. Curtin scored a striking personal triumph,polling 34,000 votes, against the combined 18.000 of his opponents. These results are the more remarkable because the press, as a whole, remained against theGovernment up to the eve of polling. They are due, in a large degree, toMr. Curtin&apos;s own prestige, and to the realization by Australians of the need for a stable government able to face the problems of war and reconstruction. Thedisunity within the ranks of the Opposition damaged their prospects, andundoubtedly contributed to the reaction in Labour&apos;s favour.13. Mr. Curtin has made suggestions for the establishment after the war ofan Empire Consultative Council which have had a mixed reception in Australia,but which have attracted notice in New Zealand and South Africa.14. The effect of new strike regulations is being awaited with interest. Notest case has yet arisen, and it is hoped that the new Government will now feelitself strong enough to overcome past shortcomings in dealing with the unsatis-factory labour situation.15. Munition stocks in Australia are now so large that workers are beingswitched over to the production of aircraft and ships.16. The Minister of External Affairs, Dr. Evatt, has stated that it wall benecessary for Australia to maintain a strong permanent army, navy and air force,and a considerable aircraft industry, if she is to take her due part in preservingpeace in the Pacific in the future.17. Mrs. Roosevelt came on to Australia from New Zealand towards the endof August, and has since had a busy time visiting the American troops and,incidentally, seeing something of Australian life. The United States Under-Secretary for War, accompanied by Army Chiefs of Staff, is also in Australia ona visit.IS aval, M ilitary and A ir A activities.18.   H.M.A.S. Stawell, minesweeper, was commissioned on the 7th.19. The strength of the Royal Australian Navy at the 31st Julv, 1943. was :Active Service 8,461, reserves 24,487.   Total 32,948.   W.R.A.N.S. 1.517.20. The improvement in the general strategical situation has made possiblereorganisation in the system of coast watching and reporting. Previously therehas been considerable duplication in the coast watching services of the Navy,Army and R.A.A.F. The reorganisation clearly defines the spheres of activity of these three services.   As they affect the Army they are as follows :  (i) All Army personnel, including Volunteer Defence Corps, employed oncoast watching duties south of the Tropic of Capricorn are to be with-clrawn and returned to their units,(ii) Army personnel north of the Tropic of Capricorn will be withdrawnfrom such places where sufficient service is provided by the VolunteerAir Observer Corps of the R.A.A.F.(iii) The activities of the North Australian Observer unit will be limited tothe northern Territory Lines of Communications area.21. Malaria. There is no significant change in the number of cases,relapses and fresh infections of malaria on the Mainland, at Port Moresby orMilne Bay. Reports from New Guinea indicate that during July a consistentdecrease of hospital admissions was maintained until the last week of the month,when a slight increase became apparent. This is attributable to relapses ratherthan new cases since the rate of first attacks continued to decrease.or 22&quot; United States forces in Australia at the end of August numbered^2,016 including 160,836 ground troops.
NEW ZEALAND.23. Mrs. RoosevelLs visit to New Zealand was a conspicuous success. ftwas, incidentally, made by her the occasion of many warm tributes to the war effort of the United Kingdom.24. Mr. Curtiirs advocacy of an Empire Consultative Council has arousedkeen interest, one view expressed being that, after the war, it will be for thesouthern Dominions to show greater willingness to take the initiative in con-nexion with the common defence policy of the Pacific. It has been said that, ifAustralia and New Zealand do not formulate a common policy, &quot; others certainlywill, but the idea will not be to our liking.&quot;25. The New Zealand elections are to be held in September and the election campaign is now well advanced. The Labour party, led by Mr. Fraser, is basingits appeal on the party&apos;s war record. It undertakes to continue the policy of amaximum contribution to the war effort of the United Nations, and to proceedwith the introduction of measures to bring about social security at home. TheOpposition advocates the formation of a &quot; non-party National Government,&quot; andis making an issue of the man-power question. It maintains that too large a proportion of New Zealand&apos;s men have been drafted into the services, and pressesfor the return of men from the army to industry and to civil life. It urges thatveterans of the New Zealand Division from the Middle East should be given the choice of returning to civil occupations. The campaign proceeds without therancour or heat of the recent Australian elections, and there is a marked absenceof personal controversy.26. A Ministry of External Affairs has been created, with the New ZealandPrime Minister as the first holder of the new ministerial post.27. The Opposition has protested against the hasty passage of controversiallegislation owing to the approaching dissolution of Parliament. The Land SalesBill, in particular, has become the object of strong criticism, being denounced ashastily conceived, unpractical, and open to use as an instrument of nationalisation.It is intended to stabilise land values and provides for the control of all sales andleases of land. Legislatioii has been passed, with popular approval, raising theschool-leaving age to 15. The press continues to gird at the Government for itsfailure to take decisive action in the matter of butter supplies for the UnitedKingdom.28. Speaking on migration. Mr. Fraser recently said : &quot; We want, as far aspossible, to keep this country British.&quot; He said that the rehabilitation of NewZealand ex-Service people would be the first concern of the Government, but thatdid not preclude attention being given to migration possibilities.29. The New Zealand Government intends to appoint a representative in moscow, probably of consular status.30. Nearly 500 awards for gallantry have been won by members of the RoyalNew Zealand Air Force and by New Zealanclers in the R.A.F.Naval, Military and A ir A cpivities.31. Both cruisers of the Royal New Zealand navy are at present laid upfor refit or repair.32. Eight Kauri motor tow-boats were launched on the 21st August for theUnited States, the first to be built in New Zealand for another country.33. The movement of the 3rd Division to Guadalcanal has started; this division will operate under 14th United States Corps.34. Brigadier Dittmer has been appointed, to command the Fiji militaryforces in place of Brigadier Wales, who is returning to New Zealand.35. Territorial Forces. The number of men mobilised was reduced to 11,655on the 20th August. 11,000 mobilised personnel have been released to industrysince the 1st April, 1943.36. Major-General Dewing, Group Captain Grice, R.A.F., and Lieutenant-Colonel Briscoe, of the United Kingdom Liaison Staff in Australia, visited NewZealand during the month.
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.37. Post-election developments confirm the impression that the result wasa oreat personal victory for Field-Marshal Smuts rather than an expression of popular satisfaction with the Government as a whole. Criticism of the short-comings of the Government food-control policy is becoming increasinglyvociferous, and the handling of the food situation is said to be &quot; by far theweakest part of the Government^ administration.&quot; There is considerablepopular resentment at the retention of Colonel Collins as Minister of Agricultureand Food Controller. The Cabinet changes, which followed on the election,amount to little more than a reshuffle of offices, and there has been no real accession of strength to the Government through the recruitment of new members. Thefollowing three new Ministries have been formed, viz., Transport; Welfare andDemobilisation; Economic Development. The holders of the new ministerial postsare Mr. Sturrock, previously Minister of Railways and Harbours, Mr. Lawrence,and Mr. Waterson.38. The first session of the new Parliament will be held in January. TheUnion is now in the lesser throes of the provincial elections. The Afrikanerparty, which was extinguished, for the time being, in the main election, has.nevertheless, decided to extend its organisation to the whole of the Union, but itwill not nominate candidates for provincial elections.39. In a speech at Port Elizabeth, summing up the final election results,Field-Marshal Smuts paid a tribute to the support which had been given to him bythe pro-war section of Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. It was a fact, whichshould be forgotten neither in Great Britain nor in South Africa, that the union would not be taking part in the war but for the support of the Afrikaners.40. Newspapers of all shades of opinion reported the debate in the IndianLegislative Assembly and Council of State on the South African &quot; Pegging &quot;Act. South African reactions were on the usual party lines, but the Natal DailyNews said : &quot; while Indian resentment is understandable, the problem created byIndian penetration into European areas calls for realism and wisdom on India&apos;aside as loudly as it calls for a more broaclminded attitude on the part of SouthAfrica.&quot; Retaliatory measures by the Government of India would only make abad situation worse. The Nationalist view differed : &quot; The Government of Indiaacts in the interests of its own people when it stops penetration by foreigners.That is the right of nationalism in its own country, just as it is the right of SouthAfrica in respect of Indians in this country.&quot;Naval, Military and A ir A activities.41. Operational squadrons of the South African Air Force are now servingoverseas in the following areas: Palestine. Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, Tunisia,Sicily and West Africa.EIRE.42. The final results were announced on the 26th August of the election to fill the 49 elective-seats in Eire&apos;sSenate of 60 members. On the whole, the charac-ter of the new elected members differs very little from that of their predecessors.Although there is supposed to be no definite party alignments in the Senatorialelections voting has usually been on party lines. Nevertheless, the new electedSenators do not faithfully reflect the party strengths of the Senatorial electors.For instance, the Labour party has secured only eight seats. The new Farmersparty will not be directly represented at all, for none of its nominees were elected. Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s party, Fine Gael, came best out of the election, since they will have more supporters in the new Senate than in the last.On the 30th August, Mr. de Valera announced the names of the eleven personswhom, under the Constitution, he has nominated as members of the Senate. they include Senator P. Campbell, a Labour nominee, defeated in the Senate election, andSir John Keane, a representative of Protestant interests, who had - also been defeated. The remainder are Government supporters. Mr. de Valera, ofcourse, will dominate the new body, for although the election brought about aslight decline in Government supporters, Mr. de Valera, with his nominated members, has been able to repair the deficiency.
43. At a country convention Of the Fanners&apos; party at Athenry on the9th August, Mr. Michael Donnellan announced that his party may contest thenext election in Northern Ireland. &quot;Our success in (he next election in thenorth &quot; he said, &quot;would bring the north and south together sooner than thepolitical parties would do it.&quot; Speaking of his party&apos;s attitude in the DailMr. Donnellan explained that they took no part in the election of a PrimeMinister because the big parties put up ;i proposition on each side in order tomake the Fanners&apos; party become identified with one of their political sides. Hesaid that his party would never take part in the formation of a Government untilthe farmers, who were 75 per cent of the population, gave it an over all majorityto form a Government of their own.44. In a statement recently issued to the Irish press by the Eire Depart-ment of Industry and Commerce, it is admitted that large scale emigrationhas partly solved Eires unemployment problem. The report says that unemploy-ment in 1942 was less in volume than the previous year and that this must be attributed chiefly to the large numbers who found employment outside thecountry. Referring to emigration, the report says that prior to 1939 the balanceof passenger traffic was out of the country: that in 1939 and 1940 it was inwards:that in 1941 and 1942 it was again outwards.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.45. Once again the month has been devoid of any significant political development. The anniversary on the 9th August of the arrest of the congress leaders passed off peacefully. Preventive arrests on a small scale frustratedplans that had been made by a section of Congress sympathisers to celebrate theday by processions or by disturbances, but it was, in any case, clear that no generalresponse would have come from the public or the followers of the Congress party.46. In provincial politics a noteworthy event was the success of the moslem league in a series of by-elections in the North-West Province. No moslem league candidate stood in that province in the general elections of 1937 and aCongress Ministry held office from 1937 until the general resignation of congress ministries in 1939. Recently, however, a Moslem League Ministry was formedand its position has now been strengthened by the victory of its supporters overCongress candidates in the four Moslem seats for which by-elections had to he held. This is further evidence of the tendency of Moslems to shake off Congressdomination and is bound to strengthen the hands of the advocates of Pakistan.47. Much public interest has recently been taken in proceedings before theFederal Court relating to the validity&apos; of Defence of India Rule 26, the ruleunder which Mr. Gandhi and the Congress leaders have been field in detention.This rule has been challenged in a number of High Courts earlier in the yearand when the Federal Court, in April, ruled that it was ultra vires of theDefence of India Act under which it purported to be made, the Viceroy proceeded to validate it by the issue of an Ordinance amending the Act. The validity ofthis Ordinance was in turn challenged in the Calcutta and other High Courtsbut in the judgment now pronounced by the Federal Court the legality of theViceroy&apos;s action has been upheld.External and Frontier Relations.48. Afghanistan. Air. Squire, His Majesty&apos;s Minister, after presentinghis credentials, was instructed to deliver a suitable message of appreciation fromthe Viceroy to the Prime Minister for his personal message referred to in lastmonth&apos;s summary.49. In reply to an enquiry from Mr. Squire, the Afghan Government statedthat they had not yet arrested the other two principal suspects whose nameswe gave them, but claimed to have sent for all the other thirty-three persons onour list and warned them individually not to have any dealings with Axis agents.Mr. Squire made it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government would continue to watch developments in Afghanistan and would require to be assured that theAfghan  Government were carrying out their undertakings to take effective
steps to put a stop to Axis-inspired intrigues. The party of four members ofthe Axis legations, who are being repatriated under safe-conduct, were expected toleave early in September.50. Negotiations for the release of the two British airmen at presentinterned in Kabul, after a forced landing in Afghan territory, continued withoutany definite decision being reached up to date.51. During the month speeches were made by the King and other prominentpersons emphasising the critical situation facing the country and the need forpreparedness for sacrifices in order to maintain neutrality and independence.Mr. Squire attributed these speeches partly to a certain anxiety about thesituation in the south of Afghanistan and partly to apprehensions caused by therecent joint approach by ourselves and the Russians on the subject of Axisintrigues. He reported that the Government appeared anxious to co-operate with us fully provided they could do so without appearing subservient. this tendency was growing with the German defeats which, however, at the same time,increased fears of Russian intentions.52. North-West Frontier. The frontier has remained satisfactorily quiet.The only incident of note was the dispersal from the vicinity of Razmak byshelling of a gathering of about 200 hostiles who had been summoned by theFaqir of Ipi to meet for the ostensible purpose of settling a boundary dispute.53. Tibet. The Government of India representative in Lhasa reported thatfresh reports from reliable sources had reached him of Chinese troop concen-trations in the Jyekundo area near the border of Tibet and that the nervoustension in Tibet was considerable. Instructions were accordingly sent to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington to take the opportunity of Mr. T. V.Soong&apos;spresence there to inform him of these reports and of the apprehensions whichthey had aroused. At the same time the representative in Lhasa was instructedto tell the Tibetan Government that the information as to Chinese troop move-men is had been brought to the notice of His Majesty&apos;s Government and to warnthem to take the utmost care to verify their- information and to ensure that theirown troops did, nothing to provoke a frontier incident.54. China. Replying to a protest from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, theChinese Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed regret that no notificationhad been given to the Indian authorities of Mme. Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s journeythrough India. He claimed, however, that the American authorities had kept hermovements so secret that the Chinese Government themselves were net fully informed.Economic.55. The serious internal economic situation in India has been explained ina comprehensive note (I.F. (43) 2) presented to the Committee on Indian financial questions which was appointed by the War Cabinet at their Meeting on the4th August. On the food situation in particular, a separate memorandum(W.P. (43) 349) was circulated to the Cabinet on the 31st July. The Governmentof India are continuing to make strenuous endeavours to cope with the situation,by all means at their disposal, and have also sought the active assistance of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, in particular with a view to the importation of somegram.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.56. Royal Indian Navy. The following vessels were launched in india during July :  One Bangor.One Trawler1.Two fair miles.Two 72&apos; M.Ls.HMIS Godavari was commissioned on the 22nd June and was accordedthe honour of leading the Home Fleet to sea during His Majesty The Kingsrecent visit.   Godavari was subsequently inspected by His Majesty.57 Military  The general situation in Burma is unchanged. enemy activity in Arakan has been very slight. Positions protecting Maungdaw-Buthidaung road on both sides of Mayu range are being strengthened by enemy.
58. There has been some sniping activity in the Chin Hills. Roads andpaths have been closed by rain and troops in the forward areas have had to besupplied by means of parachute.59. Roads in the Manipur area and forward of linphal have been interrupted by landslides and subsidences.(50. Air. The weather has been very thick over Burma and Bengal.Consequently, operations have not been on a large scale and photographic reconnaissance has been severely limited. Reconnaissance patrols on the ArakanCoast have had difficulty in completing their tasks and escort work round Ceylonhas been limited, but anti-submarine patrols and convoy escorts have continuedalong coastal shipping lanes and in the Arabian Sea,61. In spite of the bad weather, long-range offensive operations have been directed continuously against enemy airfields and communications, includingrailways in the Mandalay area. The centre span of the bridge on theMyitnge River was destroyed. Fighter bombers have destroyed a number of rivercraft on the Irrawaddv and Kaiadan rivers and between Hunter&apos;s Bay andSandoway.62. General. The health of officers and Indian troops is very good. Thatof British troops is on the whole satisfactory for the time of year and in theconditions under which thev are serving.63. The internal situation remains quiet. There were no disturbances onthe anniversary of Gandhrs arrest, and troops were not called upon to act.Railway protection schemes were put into operation in anticipation of possibletrouble, and to afford an opportunity for practice.64. Morale of both British and Indian troops, judging from patrolencounters, is high in Assam and continues to be satisfactory in Arakan. Resultsof measures taken to counter Japanese attacks on morale and security in theArmy are promising.65. Considerable feeling is being aroused among British troops byreferences, possibly exaggerated, in the British press and private letters to (a) The increase of infidelity arising from the association of British womenwith Allied and Dominion troops in England.(&amp;) Accounts of associations of British women with enemy P.O.W.(c) The increase in Venereal Disease.66. There is no change in the Indian soldiers&apos; attitude towards the problemsof high prices and food shortage, which continue to cause them considerable anxiety.67. Attention lias been drawn to the fact that, while much has been said about post-war reconstruction plans for Great Britain, so far little has been heardof how it is proposed to better the conditions of Indian ex-Servieemen after thewar. Indian soldiers are beginning to take a serious interest in their future,though so far speculation is mainly confined to wondering whether grants of land will be made or employment guaranteed. While definite plans cannot be expectedwith the political future of India so uncertain, it has been suggested that an assurance from Government that the Indian soldier will not be forgotten wouldhave a very beneficial effect on morale.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.68. Occuqyled Burma. Further details received of the provisional Constitii-tion for &quot; independent &quot; Burma show that it is contemplated that for the duration of the war at least Ba Maw, as head of the Suite, would be a dictator, and thatsome form of representative legislature would be set up when the war is over, butit is not clear whether by election or nomination.69. Ambassadors have been appointed by the puppet Government to japan and Siam, and the Japanese Ambassador in Rangoon is &quot;advising&quot; Burnia&apos;S ministry for Foreign Affairs.
70. Frontier Administration. Difficulties have arisen owing to incursionsof Chinese troops from North-West Yunnan into the Northern Myitkyina area during the past six months. Some of these troops are irregulars, but others claimto have authority from the Central Chinese Government to advance into british territory and fight the Japanese. They have made no arrangements to bring in supplies, and their demands for labour and food in an area already verging onstarvation are causing trouble with the local Kachins. In addition, they have attempted to set up a rival civil Administration in spite of the presence of british officers. Following representations at Chungking, orders for the withdrawal ofthese troops have been issued by the Central Government, but it remains to beseen how far they will be effective.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note.-In this Report &quot; Colonies is used to cover not Only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.71. Ceylon. As forecast in last montlFs report, the problem of maintaining the level of Ceyloirs food reserves gave rise to seiuous concern during the month.72. Shipment of 30,000 tons of flour from Australia to Ceylon had been planned for August, but owing, I understand, partly to the severe cut in ship-ments to the Indian Ocean area in the first half of this year, there was such ashortage of British-controlled ships in the Australian area that none could befound which would arrive in Ceylon before the end of September. As Ceylonflour stocks would have been exhausted at the present rate of consumption byabout the middle of September, ancl as owing to India&apos;s own internal fooddifficulties, if appeared improbable that supplies could be obtained from India,there was at one time a prospect that Ceylon would be completely without flourfor a period in September.73. I am glad to say. however, that the danger has now been overcome. TheMinister of War Transport was able to secure the diversion of a neutral shipfrom another service to load flour in Australia for Ceylon, and this ship should reach the Island in the first few clays of September. A second ship has also nowbeen found ancl should arrive by the third week of September. In addition, in response to an urgent appeal for help, the Government of India kindly agreedto lend Ceylon at very short notice 10,000 tons of flour to be repaid later by ship-ment from Australia. In view of the difficulties of India&apos;s own position, I think this offer was most helpful and have asked that an expression of thanks may be conveyed to the Government of India for it.74. As a result of the steps mentioned above, the threatened crisis in ceylon&apos;s flour supplies has now been averted.75. My Adviser on war-time food supplies, Dr. Clyde, arrived from Ceylonin August, and his first-hand account of conditions in the Island will undoubtedly be of the greatest use in dealing with the problem of feeding Ceylon. Dr. Clydewas also able, while he was in Ceylon, to give valuable advice to those concernedwith the administration of food supplies in the Island.76. Northern Rhodesia. Partly as a. measure of insurance against a short-fall in local crops, and partly to enable rations to native labourers to be restoredas quickly as possible to the full normal scale, the Governor asked for 10,000 tonsof maize before the end of November. It is not yet possible to say definitely where these supplies can be obtained, but the Governor has some hopes of help from theUnion of South Africa.77. East Africa. The reports received during the month about cropprospects continued to be favourable.
78. Aden. Supplies of millet are being arranged from Egypt and other sources to relieve the famine conditions referred to in my report for June. Theprice of these supplies unfortunately is very high. To enable the millet to be soldat a price which the population can afford to pay, a Treasury subsidy has been necessary.Textile Supplies.79. By far the greater part of the supplies of cotton piece-goods, which are so important to the Colonies as consumer goods to stimulate their production offood and raw materials, come from this country and from India, and productionof these two countries cannot now&apos;meet the full colonial demand. It seemshopeless to look for any large increase of exports to the Colonies from either thiscountry, owing to the labour situation, or from India, owing to the shortage of consumer goods in India itself. The only other country from which there seemsany hope of obtaining substantial supplies is the United States, and the proposalto try and obtain supplies from that country both for the Colonies and for other areas which are short of textiles, such as the Middle East, is now being exploredby the Colonial Office with the Ministry of Production and other departmentsconcerned. It is considered important that a really effective ease should hepresented to the United States authorities.Defence.80. West Indies. July report, paragraph 81. Negotiations regarding theemployment of Puerto Rican troops in the Caribbean are continuing in washington. Meanwhile, news has been received from the Governor of british guiana that 0 Puerto Rican officers and 200 other ranks have arrived in theColony, one of the three to which it had been agreed that the Puerto Hi cans shouldbe posted.81. Mauritius. The lack of protection for Mauritius harbours againstsubmarines is giving me considerable anxiety in view of the increased U-boatactivity in the waters around the Island. Mauritius is at present without mine-sweepers or anti-submarine launches, and I have had the question of theirprovision taken up as a matter of urgency with the Admiralty. The governor of Mauritius has also been in touch with the Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet,over this matter. Damage to the harbours would be particularly serious, sinceMauritius depends to a large extent on imports for its food supplies. The Islandalso exports a considerable volume of sugar, allocated by the Ministry of Food tothe Middle East, and it is important that this supply should not be cut off.82. The Governor and the local Service authorities in Mauritius feel thatthe commanders of submarines may possibly be receiving information from withinthe Island itself. The Governor has. after consultation with the Service and security authorities, taken measures to tighten up security, and I hope that a visit by a security expert will shortly be arranged.Reports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.83. The successful completion of the Sicilian campaign, the fall of mussolini and the Russian successes on the Eastern Front have all served to reinforce the general conviction that Allied victory is only a matter of time; andconsequently increasing attention is being paid to the post-war future of theMiddle East territories from the political and economic angles.84. The inclination of local Arab politicians to view Palestine as an integral part of the Middle East context is being strengthened, and developments in neighbouring territories followed with keen interest. A reported statement byNuri Pasha as to the possible exclusion of Palestine from the Arab Federationtalks evoked unanimous opposition in the Arab press, and resulted in areassurance being obtained from Nuri as to the inclusion of Palestine in thediscussions. There is a growing consciousness among Arabs of the need for unity and a clear-cut programme, but effective local leadership is still lacking.85. On the 11th August, in Jerusalem, two British soldiers were sentenced to fifteen years&apos; imprisonment (subject to confirmation by the General OfficerCommanding) for smuggling arms and ammunition into Palestine. The trial on similar charges of three Jewish civilians is in progress.  The officer defending the
two British soldiers pleaded, in mitigation of sentence, that they had found them-selves enmeshed in a vast, powerful and ruthless illegal organisation, which clearlyindicated the complicity of Mr. Ben Gurion and the Jewish Agency. Mr. BenGurioh addressed a complaint to the General Officer Commanding against what he regarded as a slanderous attack. The Jewish Press has confined itself toaccounts of the actual proceedings, emphasising items tending to reflectunfavourably on witnesses for the prosecution. There is also keen Arab interest,but no evidence of tension. Jewish recruitment since the reopening of the jewish agency recruiting office has been low, and it is thought that this is due todeliberate neutralisation of the Agency recruiting appeal, by the extremistelement led by Mr. Ben Gurion.86. An ad hoc Planning Committee was opened at the end of July to deviseand co-ordinate a plan of campaign against inflation. Departments and non-official representatives of bodies of standing were invited to put forwardconcrete proposals for combating the present tendencies of the cost of living.The Counnittee&apos;s report is still under consideration.87. A standing Committee of four official and three non-official membershas been established to advise the Government on the application of the policyof subsidisation within the financial limits prescribed, and to keep under reviewoperations of trade accounts.88. There were violent fluctuations in gold prices during the month ofAugust.89. Public security has remained generally satisfactory, though highwayrobbery on a minor scale continues.Gold Coast.90. During August considerable public indignation was aroused in theGold Coast by an incident, following on others of a less serious character, inwhich a lorry driven by a member of the United States military forces drove intoa body of Nigerian troops stationed in the Gold Coast, killing a number of themand injuring a great many more. The driver did not even trouble to report the accident. As a result of strong representations by the Governor, the UnitedStates military authorities placed the driver under arrest, and took various stepsdesigned to counteract the inevitable friction between members of the Africanpublic and the United States forces. The Governor&apos;s telegraphic report of what had occurred was at once communicated to the Foreign Office, who instructedHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington to make strong representations to theUnited States Government, and to press for prompt and effective action to betaken to ensure that better ^discipline should in future be maintained among theUnited States forces in West Africa. The Governor has since reported that thedriver of the lorry has been sentenced by a United States court-martial to3^ years&apos; imprisonment with hard labour, total forfeiture of all pay and allowances due or to become due. and dishonourable discharge.Ceylon.91. The Commander-in-Chief has decided, after discussion with theMilitary Authorities in India, to remove to a limited extent the ban on the entry to Ceylon of civilian British women and children from the Dominions. colonies and foreign countries. Owing to the much greater passage difficulties in thecase of women and children proceeding from the United Kingdom, however, ithas been necessary to decide that entry permits from the United Kingdom will only be issued in exceptional cases.92.   These concessions were made public on the 24th August.Fiji.93. Constitution. On the 25th August a Motion by the Senior EuropeanUnofficial Member of the Legislative Council proposing Constitutional advanceswas debated. The motion called for the election of all Unofficial Members, theabolition of the Official majority, and the grant of the franchise to Civil servants and women. The Governor, Sir Philip Mitchell, sought the approval of theSecretary of State for the appointment of a Committee of the LegislativeCouncil to consider these proposals and to prepare detailed recommendations for constitutional reform. The Secretary of State agreed, on the understandingthat at this stage he is not committed in any way.
94. Dispute in the Sugar Industry. A series of strikes among mill workers and later among Indian peasant cane farmers, appealing respectively for higher wages and for a higher price for cane, began towards the end of June. Attemptsby the Government to settle the points at issue, first by arbitration, then by aCommission of Enquiry constituted under the Industrial Disputes (conciliation and Arbitration) Ordinance, were unsuccessful, principally because any findingof the Commission involving the payment of a higher price for cane would necessarily mean a revision of the price paid for sugar by the Ministry of Food-a matter not within the competence of the Commission. As after repeatedopportunities had been given, no evidence was forthcoming before the Commissionon behalf of the cane farmers, the Governor was obliged to announce that, since no attempt had been made to substantiate their case for a higher price for cane,he could see no grounds for taking further action.95. The cutting of cane then began in various districts on a small scale, insome instances under military protection. Two Indians were arrested forattempting to stop cane cutting in contravention of Defence Regulations, the caneindustry having been declared an Essential Service. Two others were alsoprosecuted under Defence Regulations for having disregarded restrictions placed upon them as a result of attempted propaganda against the cutting of cane.96. The situation remains quiet, but the cutting of cane has still not begun in some areas. The importance attached by the Ministry of Food to thecontinuance of Fiji sugar production for the Canadian and New Zealand marketshas been impressed on the Governor.West Indies.97. Anglo-American Caribbean Commission. The Commission held itsfourth meeting at St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands on the17th August. The primary subject of discussion has been agricultural research in the Caribbean area and United States. Dutch and British specialists have attended the meeting.
