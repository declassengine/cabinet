I think we should allagree that this is the long-term objective to be desired and aimed at. It should, inparticular, include a recognition of the strategic unity of these islands and theconsequent necessity, for the purpose of security, that we should have at ourdisposal the use of bases and other facilities in Ireland as a whole.The question, however, is whether the approach by the United States toMr. de Valera which is now proposed is calculated to further this ultimateobjective.We must first consider, assuming that the approach is made, what the replyis likely to be. On this point we can be certain that the reply will not be positive,i.e., that Mr. de Valera will not undertake at this stage to bring Southern Irelandinto the war on the Allied side or to give open and unneutral facilities to theAllied forces. Whatever his personal views might be, the universal attitude ofthe people of Southern Ireland, after four years of consistent preaching ofneutrality from the pulpit, press and platform, is so wedded to that policythat it would be next door to impossible for anyone to move them from it.If the reply were to be a simple negative, perhaps we might feel that not muchharm was being done. The Irish would be developing a quarrel with the UnitedStates, which could not well harm us.But it is reasonably certain that Mr. de Valera would not content himselfwith a crude refusal. He would take the opportunity to proclaim to the worlda restatement of Irish grievances. He would not fail to cast the blame for Irishneutrality on this country, on the score of the history of the past and of theseverance of Northern Ireland. Such a statement of his case might well commandconsiderable sympathy not only in Southern Ireland itself but among the peopleof Irish descent throughout the world, both in the United States and in thiscountry and in the overseas Dominions. The effect of this might well be to makeit more, rather than less, difficult for us to rely on American support in ignoringIrish clamour. Further, it might mean that the United States would inevitablyhave to be treated as a partner in any post-war negotiations between ourselvesand the Irish as to the ultimate set-up, which would surely be most embarrassing^ There is also the question of the effect on opinion in Parliament and withthe public here. At this stage of the war there is likely to be considerable resent-ment if any offer were made to Southern Ireland to enable them to join now aftertheir signal abstention in darker days. The feeling in Northern Ireland wouldbe particularly strong. Public opinion, too,, would resent an American approachas being a statement of an American claim to interfere between this country anda country which is still regarded here as forming a part of the BritishCommonwealth.[26092]
If, on strategic grounds, there were an urgent and immediate need forfacilities in Southern Ireland, the above long-term and other considerationswould have to give way to the military necessity. In that event, a joint Anglo-American demand to be followed, if necessary, by the use of force to secure therequired facilities, would be the appropriate course. But the view of mycolleagues at their recent meeting was that at this time the strategic issues arenot of such compelling force and that the decision should be governed by politicalconsiderations.At the present time, our treatment of Eire is based on the principle of&quot; absent treatment.&quot; We deal firmly with such questions as arise on a basisof our own self-interest. We allow them a minimum of necessary supplies and, (on the other hand, we receive from them considerable practical help in vitalmatters affecting the war. Much of this is of a secret nature and cannot bereferred to publicly. By pursuing this policy we avoid commitments to SouthernIreland, and at the same time keep our hands completely free to treat them inthe post-war settlement as may then be most convenient and useful. There isnothing in this which would prejudice the adoption of the long-term policydefined above. On the contrary, we should at the end of the war have a SouthernIreland which has forfeited any claim to the sympathy of the United Nations, andour position in dealing with her would be a strong one.For these reasons I hope that it will be possible to persuade the United StatesGovernment not to press the proposed approach to Mr. de Valera now. In sofar as the suggestion is made with the object of furthering good relations betweenthis country and the United States by keeping the Irish question from becominga source of friction between the two countries, it seems to me that it is not welljudged. In so far as it is a question of internal politics in the United States(which appears to be a major factor in the mind of the President and ofMr. Gray), it is hardly for us to advise, but here again, we can perhaps say thatwe feel doubtful whether giving Mr. de Valera a platform for airing&apos; Irishgrievances in reply to the United States Government can really be helpful fromthe point of view of internal politics in the United States.If, none the less, the United States Government insist on making theirapproach, then the least dangerous course would seem to be for us to make aseparate and simultaneous approach. But the form of this would require carefulconsideration, and if we are not entirely to jeopardise our ultimate objective, itwould have to be on somewhat different lines from the &quot;indictment&quot; which theUnited States authorities have drafted. In that case it would be necessary toascertain the views of the Dominion Prime Ministers before taking action, in viewof the issues raised by the introduction of the United States into a matterconcerning the interrelation of two member States of the British Commonwealth.Dominions Office,16th September, 1943.C.
