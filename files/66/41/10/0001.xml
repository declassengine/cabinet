Aircraft Carriers Dispositions and Movements.Home Fleet H.M.S. IllustriousHALS. FuriousH.M.S. UnicornL26085]During July these carriers took part in two feintoperations in the direction of the Norwegian coast. Inthe first, on the 8th July, the Battlefieet, accompaniedby H.M.S. Furious, covering a dummy convoy, sailed from Scapa and turned towards the Norwegian coastafter clearing the Shetlands. It was the intention ofthe Commander-in-Chief that these forces should besighted and reported by enemy aircraft, followingwhich H.M.S. Furious&apos;s aircraft were to shoot theenemy down. The operation was perfectly timed andexecuted and one B.V. 138 3-engined floatplane was destroyed by Martlet fighters from H.M.S. Furiousafter making sighting reports.The second, larger, operation took place somewhatlater. Martlet fighters from H.M.S. Illustrious shot down two enemy aircraft both B.V. 138 3-eno-inedseaplanes one about 120 miles N.N.E. of theShet lands and the other some 60 miles to the South.HALS. Furious is now undergoing a periodicalrefit.Urgent operational requirements have necessitated thisship being used in the second of her dual roles thatof an operational aircraft carrier. In this capacityher service has been satisfactory. Her primary roleas an aircraft repair ship should in the future make an essential contribution to the speedy aircraftreinforcement of the carrier fleet, cutting out thenecessity for individual units to return to base forrepair and overhaul. She will be a vital requirement for the war in the Far East as her repair facilities are most extensive.b
Mediterranean Fleet H.M.S. Indomitable(Flying Flag ofRear - Admiral(Aircraft Car-riers))HALS. FormidableThe fighter cover provided by these two main FleetCarriers, operating Seafire and Martlet fighters,ensured the immunity of the different sections of theFleet from any serious air attack throughout thesuccessful Sicilian operations.At the close of the operations Indomitable was un-fortunately hit by a torpedo dropped by a singleintruder enemy aircraft at night and sustained some damage. She has proceeded under her own power tothe United States for repairs and should be operationalagain in a few months. Formidable remains with theMediterranean Fleet operating from Malta. She is urgently in need of a refit, her maximum speed is now only 25 knots owing to engine defects. It is hoped totake her in hand shortly.Pacific A rea.HALS.  VictoriousVictorious was operating under United StatesCommand, but will shortly return to the UnitedKingdom. She is equipped with American aircraft,and has been working in successful co-operation with american Task Forces and with U.S.S. Saratoga.A great deal of valuable experience has been gained of joint operations for which Victorious, after a thorough working up period, conformed in every wayto American methods. It will not be possible tocarry out such a complete change in carrier operation in other than those carriers specifically detailed towork under the Americans.Admiral Ramsey, U.S.N., in command of TaskGroup 36.3, has expressed his cqmplete satisfactionwith the work of Victorious, notably during the timein which the Saratoga and the Victorious were engaged covering the Solomons operations. It is ofinterest that Victorious has been operating 52aircraft, whereas she was built to carry and operate 33.Escort Carriers.Evidence of the effect of shore to shore air cover for convoys is given by the escort Carriers Biter, Archer and Battler. Not one of the great number ofmerchant vessels comprising eight separate convoys was lost while under their protection.FI.M.S. Biter     ...    The submarine packs concentrated on convoys covered byH.M.S. Biter. In no instance was a U-Boat able tobreak through the defence and make an attack while. Biter was present. Fog, poor visibility, ancl frequentrainstorms made air patrol over the atlantic convoy HX. 237 difficult and hazardous. In spite ofthis 63 sorties were made and seven submarines were attacked. Air crews operated continuously for ninedays, but never failed to carry out their task.Equally satisfactory results were obtained in two otherconvoys-SC. 129 and HX. 242.H.M.S. Archer  ...    While covering convoy FIX. 239 from Newfoundland tothe Clyde, aircraft were continuously operated in bad weather. 39 sorties were made in three days. Foursubmarines were attacked one definitely sunk andothers put down and prevented from closing the convoy. One of her Swordfish aircraft scored a killwith a Rocket Projectile.   This was the first time this
H.M.S Battlerweapon had been used. A second convoy, O.N.S. 6,was brought safely to its destination without loss. an anti-submarine sweep through the Bay of Biscay wascarried out in a heavy anti-cyclonic haze, but nosubmarine remained on the surface long enough tomake an air attack possible. Several formations ofJu. 88&apos;s were encountered, but owing topoor visibilitynone was killed. One enemy formation almost raninto two Swordfish. This evidently warned the enemy of the presence of a carrier, as they were heardimmediately afterwards to be making their homingsignal.Three convoys (OS. 49, KMS. 16, XK. 9) were coveredwithout loss. On one occasion an F.W. 200 shadowingthe convoy apparently failed to appreciate Battler&apos;spresence and was sighted 10 miles from the carrier.It was shot down by Battlers fighters (Martlets) in afew minutes and no attack on the convoy developed.H.M.S.

Ships-Empire MacalpineEmpire Macandrewf26085]The twin functions of these vessels cargo carryingand providing air cover for convoys are made possible by harmonious co-operation between theNavy and the Merchant Service, and are being carriedput with excellent results. It has been shown that aircover makes a substantial contribution to the safety of any convoy, and its increase through the M.A.C.ship is additional insurance. It should be remarked,when considering the possibilities of these ships, thatthey are the smallest landing fields in the world.They suffer from severe limitations of speed, deckspace and number of  aircraft  carried,  and  theyb 2
impose a considerable strain ou the Hying crewsoperating from them. In spite of all these drawbackstheir initial operations have been most successful andthey have already provided air cover in two atlantic convoys, during one of which 33 sorties were made without accident.The efficiency of the specially designed loading and unloading equipment of these cargo-aircraft carrierswas demonstrated by the Empire Macalpine, who atthe end of her first operational voyage discharged7.500 tons of grain in 16 hours.Section II. Detached Naval Squadrons Operating from Shore Bases.Home.   (Under RAF. Fighter Command.)Night assaults on E-boats penetrating into our coastal waters were carriedout by two squadrons (now reduced to one) from bases in the South of England.Losses inflicted on the enemy probably amounted to 40 per cent, of his effectives.The night assaults were subsequently carried to the enemy&apos;s coastline,resulting in satisfactory actions on thirteen nights. A total of 31 E- and R-boatswas sunk or damaged.Eastern Mediterranean.Now reduced to- one squadron (6 Walrus) A/S patrol and escort dutiesoperating from Beirut.Malta.The well-stocked hunting ground which yielded 410.000 tons of Axis shipping to the Malta Squadrons during the period of the siege was less prolific. but one squadron at times increased to two found targets in a supply ship (sunk),a 10,000-ton tanker (seriously damaged) and a destroyer which was finished off by surface action.Meanwhile Sicilian harbours were regularly bombed and mined by naval aircraft from Malta, and in the reduction of Pantelleria a useful contributionwas made to the action of surface vessels.Gibraltar.One squadron (6 Swordfish) A/S patrols and escort duties.North Africa.Adequate and successful protection has been provided to convoys by naval aircraft based at Bone, Blicla, Tafaroui, Monastir and Mersa Matruh.

These squadrons were only Avithdrawn when their aircraft were not capable of further operation.Section III. New Types of Aircraft.Barracudas, Tarpons, Corsairs, Hellcats are now coming into service.
