THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MRJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTHE REORGANISATION OF COMMAND IN INDIA ANDSOUTH-EAST ASIA.Memorandum by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.1. The vigorous and effective prosecution of large-scale operations against japan in South-East Asia and the rapid development of the air route throughBurma to China necessitate the reorganisation of the High Command in theIndian theatre.2. The functions of Supreme Operational Command, combined with thoseof War Member of the Government of India and Commander-in-Chief, India;responsible for all military administration, training and internal security, are more than one man can discharge. It has therefore been decided that thestatutory command in India shall be divided from the Operational command in South-East Asia, as described below.Command in India.3. The administration of India as a base for the forces in South-East Asiawill remain under the control of a statutory Commander-in-Chief, India,responsible to the Government of India and the Viceroy. Co-ordination of movement and maintenance both of the operational forces based on India and ofthe internal garrison can best be carried out efficiently by one staff responsible in the last resort to one authority with power to decide priorities. this machinery exists to-day in the Government of India and in G.H.Q., India. It isthe only machinery which can carry out the dual tasks of meeting the internalrequirements of India as well as the requirements of operations in the South-east asia theatre (see paragraph 7 below).Command in South-East Asia.4. From a study of the Command systems in other theatres, particularly those where Allied as well as British forces are operating, the conclusion hasbeen reached that the appointment of a Supreme Allied Commander, responsiblefor the conduct of operations against Japan in South-East Asia and for thedevelopment of the air route to China, is the best arrangement. Subordinate tothe Supreme Allied Commander will be a Deputy Supreme Allied commander and a Naval Commander-in-Chief, an Army Commander-in-Chief and an AirCommander-in-Chief.5. General Stilwell will be Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of theSouth-East Asia theatre, and in that capacity will command the Chinese troopsoperating into Burma and all United States air and ground forces committed tothe South-East Asia theatre.(a) The operational control of the Chinese forces operating into Burma willbe exercised, in conformity with the overall plan of the British ArmyCommander-in-Chief, by the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander orby his representative, who will be located with the troops.(6) The operational control of the 10th Air Force will be vested in the deputy Supreme Allied Commander and exercised by his air repre-sentative located at the headquarters of the Air Commander-in-Chief.(c) General Stilwell will continue to have the same direct responsibility toGeneralissimo Chiang Kai-shek as heretofore. His dual functionunder the Supreme Allied Commander and under the Generalissimois recognised.(d) The organisation and command of the United States Army and NavyAir Transport Services in the South-East Asia area will remain underthe direct control of the Commanding General, United States army air Forces, and of the Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet,respectively, subject to such supply and service functions as may beby them delegated to the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander.Requests by the Supreme Allied Commander for the use of UnitedStates troop carrier aircraft for operational purposes will be transmitted to the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander.[25999]
(e) Requests for the use of surface transportation capacity in and throughIndia, or for development involving construction for the air route to China, will he passed through the Supreme Allied Commander inorder that they may he related, as regards priority, to his requirementsbefore being placed on the Commander-in-Chief, India.0. The Naval Commander-in-Chief will be subordinate to the Supreme allied commander in all matters connected with the Security and Support of the landcampaigns and amphibious operations in South-East Asia. But in all matters connected with the Security of Sea Communications in the Indian Ocean bothoutside and inside the area of the South-East Asia Command and with offensive action against the enemy&apos;s naval forces, he will be responsible to the BritishAdmiralty direct.7. The Commands in India and in South-East Asia will therefore be reorganised as follows :  A. The Commander-in-Chief, India, will be responsible for (i) The defence (including the local naval defence of coasts and harbours)and the internal security of India, with the proviso that the Govern-ment of India may authorise the Supreme Allied Commander,South-East Asia Command, to exercise the functions and responsibilities of Commander-in-Chief in certain areas. TheCommander-in-Chief, India, will also continue to exercise his presentresponsibilities in respect of the East Persia Supply Route.(ii) In addition to his responsibilities for such forces as are under his command for the purposes set out in A (i) above, he will be responsible,in conformity with the operational requirements of the supreme allied Commander (a) for discipline, administration, movement and training of the land forces and forces of the Royal Indian.Navy which are in Indiabut which have been assigned to the Supreme allied commander; and(b) for the provision and control of such administrative services forall air forces based on India and placed under the Command ofthe Supreme Allied Commander (including their supporting-training and maintenance establishments) as after consulta-tion betweeen the Command.er-in-Chief. India, and the supreme allied Commander they consider can most conveniently becarried out by the Commander-in-Chief, India.The Supreme Commander will give to the Commander-in-Chief,India, such assistance in technical maintenance and training for airforces assigned for the defence of India as the Commander-in-Chief,India, may require.(iii) Control of the agencies in India necessary for the provision of personnel and material, assembly, despatch and maintenance (except in respectof the air forces which are governed by paragraph 7 A (ii) (&amp;) above)of the forces based on India, and for issue of executive orders in thisconnection, in accordance with the requirements of the supreme allied Commander and for placing the necessary demands on theUnited Kingdom, United States, India or C.P.O., Eastern GroupSupply Council, for these forces, except for direct demands whichmay be made by the Navy or Air Force Commanders-in-Chief on admiralty or Air Ministry sources of supply.B. The Supreme Allied Command in South-East Asia will be set up asfollows : 0(i) The Command and Staff will be a combined British ancl American one on the lines of the North African Command.(ii) The Supreme Allied Commander to be British, with an American deputy.He will have under him Naval, Army and Air Commanders-in-Chief, and also a Principal Administrative Officer to co-ordinate theadministrative planning of all three Services and of the Allied forces.He will also have a British economic and financial adviser.

Asia Command and India Command,all R.N. forces and all forces of the R.I.N. which may be allotted by the Commander-in-Chief, India, to the supreme commander for operational purposes.(b) all land forces which may be within the boundaries of the S.E.Asia Command.(c) all R.A.F. units and establishments which may be within the boundaries of the S.E. Asia Command and India Command,including their administration, except as provided in sub-paragraph (A) (ii) (b) above; and any I.A.F. within the sameboundaries which may be allotted by the Commander-in-Chief,India, to the Supreme Allied Commander for operationalpurposes.8. The South-East Asia Command will be identical with the area at presentallocated to the India Command, excepting India itself and territory westwardup to the present boundary with the Persia-Iraq Command. The boundaries ofthe South-East Asia Command will be as follows :  &quot; (a) Eastern Boundary? From the point where the frontiers of Burma,Indo-China, and Thailand meet, southwards along the easternboundary of Thailand and Malaya to Singapore; from Singaporesouth to the North Coast of Sumatra; thence round the East coast of Sumarta (leaving the Sunda Strait to the eastward of the line) toa point on the coast of Sumatra at longitude 104 degrees East; thenceSouth to latitude 08 degrees South; thence South-easterly towardsOnslow, Australia, and, on reaching longitude l-*9 degrees East, dueSouth along that meridian.(b) Northern Boundary. From the point where the frontiers of Burma,Indo-China, and Thailand meet, generally north and west along theeastern and northern frontier of Burma to its junction with the Indo-Burma border; thence along that border to the sea; thence round thecoast of India and Persia (all exclusive to the South-East AsiaCommand) to meridian 60 degrees East.&quot;(c) Western Boundary. Southward along meridian 60 degrees Eastt toAlbatross Island, thence South-eastward to exclude Rodriguez Islandiand thence due southward.9. All operations in Burma, including the control of Chinese forces operating in that country, and in the rest of the area defined, will be underSouth-East Asia Command. Within India itself the Supreme Allied Commanderwill exercise operational direction and control over all forces assigned to him forthe purpose of the operations against Japan. It will be mutually agreed between him and the Commander-in-Chief, India, at what stage the latter will surrendercommand over the forces required and cease to have the responsibility laid downin paragraph 7 A (ii) (a).10. The Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, South-East AsiaCommand, should be formed in the first instance at Delhi, since it will take overelements of the present General Headquarters, India. The Supreme allied commander will submit his recommendations as to the ultimate location of his headquarters as soon as he has had time to study the problem.Division  of Responsibility  in  India and South-East  Asia  and  CommandRelationships.11. Conflicts of opinion over priorities in connection with Administrationmust be anticipated. It will therefore be necessary for someone on the spot to resolve these differences day by day as they occur.   This authority will be the* Dividing lino between Indian theatre and Pacific theatre (J.S.M. 165. 4th April, 1942).f Boundary between India Command and Persia-Iraq Command (Directive to C-in-CP.A.I.C., dated the 14th March, 1943).% Transferred to Command of G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa, on the 1st September 1942(Telegram No. CCS.

Viceroy, not in his statutory capacity as Governor-General, but acting on behalfof the War Cabinet. For this purpose, it will be necessary that he should have at his disposal a suitable organisation independent of the Departments of theGovernment of India.12. The Supreme Commander will in any event have direct access to theBritish Chiefs of Staff on all matters, and if he is not satisfied with the rulingof the Viceroy on administrative matters, he will be able to exercise this right.The Commander-in-Chief, India, will continue to have the right of direct access to the Chiefs of Staff on certain matters arising from his responsibilities as defined in paragraph 7 A above.13. The Combined Chiefs of Staff will exercise a general jurisdiction over strategy for the South-East Asia Theatre, and the allocation of american and British resources of all kinds between the China Theatre and the South-east asia Command. The British Chiefs of Staff will exercise jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to operations, and will be the channel through which allinstructions to the Supreme Commander are passed.The Co-ordination of American Agencies such as O.S.S., O.W.I., F.C.B., dec,,with comparable British organisations.14. In order to facilitate the free exchange of information and co-co-ordination between the United States and. British quasi-military agencies in India and theSouth-Fast Asia Command, a Combined Liaison Committee wiil be set up at new Delhi.There will be full and open discussion in the Combined Liaison committee before any quasi-military activities involving operations in India or the South-East Asia Theatre are undertaken.
