THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 401.16th September, 1943FOOD PROBLEMS LIKELY TO- ARISE IN LIBERATED EUROPE.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.IN pursuance of our policy of reducing by every possible means the food-stuffs available to the enemy, our propaganda has hitherto exhorted occupiedEurope to prevent agricultural products from reaching the Germans, and hasimpressed upon growers in the countries concerned that they should resist and&quot;Go Slow.&quot; Local resistance has in fact hindered Axis exploitation of theagricultural resources of the occupied countries, and the destruction of crops and machinery is increasing in Western Europe.2. The time has perhaps come to consider whether our propaganda needsrevision in view of the problems which may before long confront the allied armies of liberation. The gravity of those problems will largely depend upon the speed of our advance and the measures taken by the Germans as they retreat; buttemporary disorganisation, peasant hoarding and the breakdown of controls mayby themselves give rise to a position of acute difficulty.3. We have consistently refused to allow relief through the blockade, except to Greece : we have, however, always said that supplies would follow ouradvancing troops. The Allied Governments doubtless have some unstanding of the extent to which the world food situation has altered since our promise was first made, but the Allied populations will feel bitterly disillusioned if their liberation is followed by a food shortage worse than they have yet experienced.4. Annex 1 to this paper shows our information as to the present food situation in Europe : Annex 2 provides some notes suggesting, with a minimum of detail, the existing possibilities of making good the European deficiencies. Itappears that for some time liberated Europe cannot be fed even on a most modest scale unless some countries outside Europe are prepared to reduce their consumption besides maintaining or increasing their production; and that incertain circumstances the collapse of German resistance might be followed bygrave famine conditions in Europe.5. I ask my colleagues to consider whether we should not now expresslydeprecate the destruction of crops in occupied Europe except in the last resort,and should instead recommend people to hide their produce or feed it to livestock.A reversal of our present policy might enable the Germans to seize some food-stuffs which would otherwise have been destroyed; on the other hand, we shouldbe doing what we could to reduce our Allies&apos; demands for food at the close ofhostilities in Europe. We should, if possible, decide our policy before the autumnsowings. It may well be to our advantage to encourage autumn and springsowings, as none of the resulting harvests will be available before July 1944.. &apos; &apos; &apos; s.Ministry of Economic Warfare,lQth September, 1943.Copy, NowWAR CABINET.[26089]
ANNEX 1.Food Conditions in Enemy-Occupied Europe.In enemy-occupied Europe the country people, nearly all of whom growsome food, have, with few exceptions, been able to maintain their pre-war diet.Most of the townspeople obtain only half the recognised calorie requirements of2,500-3.000 calories per head per day.2.   The position may be illustrated by the following comparison :  Bread.Ration per head per week.In France,Belgium and In theHolland. In Norway. hi Greece. U.K.4 lbs. 4 lbs. 3 lbs. Un rationed.Meat.3^-4 oz. Nil. Nil. 18. oz.Fats.24-5 oz. 7 oz. No fixed ration. 8 oz.Infrequent dis-tributions ofolive oil.(The level of meat and fats consumption in the United States is substantially higher than in the United Kingdom, but cannot be accurately described owingto the system of points rationing in America.) Most people in continentaltowns are. however, even worse off by comparison with us than the above figures show, because sausages, offals, &amp;c, are included in their ration, and rationcoupons have to be given up for bread, meat and fats, in canteens and restaurants.Only children get unskimmed milk, and virtually all foodstuffs, includingpotatoes, are rationed.3. Various factors have contributed to this state of affairs. First is the lossof food and animal feed imports on which Belgium. Holland. Norway and Greecelargely depended. Second, there is German requisitioning, which has been on alarge scale in France and Poland. Third, in spite of increased sowings, agricul-tural productivity throughout the continent has decreased. Harvests have fallensome 10-20 per cent, compared with pre-war; meat and dairy produce about25 per cent. It will be a long time before Europe&apos;s food production regains pre-war levels. After the last war it was 7 years before crops were normal, and10 years before the size of the herds was restored.4. The townspeople in the liberated countries will need to be provided assoon as possible from outside Europe not only with more food than they are atpresent getting in terms of calories, but equally important with a better-balanced diet (e.(j., more dairy products, meat and fats), in order to restore and maintain their health and to prevent widespread unrest. The first essential,however, will be to ensure that they are not worse off for food than before their liberation.ANNEX 2.Notes on the Possibility of making good European Food Deficiencies.Subject to the strict limitations imposed by inland transport and portclearance (not to mention shortage of shipping), wheat could be made availablein 1943/44 out of substantial stocks, mainly in Canada; and, after allowing forrising consumption in the United States, there should still be enough supplies for europe in 1944/45 if bread was all that Europe required. But Europe needsnot only bread, but dairy products, fats and meat as well. The difficulty ofproviding her with a moderate amount of these latter foodstuffs, in addition tosufficient wheat, is immense.
2. Broadly speaking, the entire production of dairy products, fats and meataccessible to the United Nations is now being consumed outside the blockade area(except for limited quantities allowed to Neutrals). The extent to which world production of these foodstuffs can be increased for purposes of consumptionduring 1944/45 is small and strictly limited, particularly, in many countries, by shortage of man-power. Moreover, if the United States output of livestock products is even to be maintained grain must be fed to beasts; but, owing to increased and still rising consumption, the United States has no surplus of wheatthis year (1943/44). In order, therefore, to increase livestock products the states would have to draw very heavily on Canadian stocks. In so far as transport andother limitations allowed them to do so, the effect might be to change- the worldwheat situation to one of scarcity.3. In these circumstances it is difficult to see how the minimum suppliesnecessary for Europe after liberation are to be provided except by a reduction inthe consumption of dairy products, fats and meat in the countries outside Europe.4. For the purposes of this paper, it has been assumed that food consump-tion in Eui&apos;european neutral countries, and in Turkey and Eire, will be maintained at the present levels; no account has been taken of possible additional Russianrequirements, nor of enemy countries
