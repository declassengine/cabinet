&apos;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT JJPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 440.oth October, 1943.WAR CABINET.ELECTORAL REFORM.Report of the Committee on Electoral Machinery.on each occasion during the last three years when the Second Reading ofthe Prolongation of Parliament Bill has been moved, an undertaking has beengiven that, before another general election, facilities would be granted for a debate on the electoral system. The Ministerial Committee on ElectoralMachinery are unanimous in the opinion that time (preferably two days) should begranted for such a Debate early in the new Session.Suggestions have been made from various quarters that questions relating toelectoral reform should be referred to a Speaker&apos;s Conference, following the precedent set at the end of the last war. The Ministerial Committee thought thatit would be difficult and indeed wrong to resist these suggestions and consideredthat a convenient course would be to arrange for the suggested Debate on electoral reform to take place on a Motion inviting the Speaker to preside overa Conference. There would be obvious advantages in holding such a Debate afterthe Electoral Machinery Bill (which will be limited to questions of machinery andshould not be controversial) and the Prolongation of Parliament Bill have been passed into law, but to ensure the easy passage of these measures it is important that Members of Parliament should be told in advance that facilities will begranted for a Debate on electoral reform. It would be desirable that an under-taking to this effect should be given in answer to an arranged Question soon afterthe House reassembles.2. There are a number of questions relating to various aspects of electoral reform which could, it is suggested, be properly referred to a Speaker&apos;s Con-ference. I attach, in the Appendix, a copy of the terms of reference of the speaker&apos;s Conference in 1916. It will be noted that these terms of reference were drawn in-wide and general terms; there seems to be no reason why this precedentshould not be followed on this occasion, and it is suggested that the terms ofreference of the Speaker&apos;s Conference should be as follows :  (a) Reform of the franchise (both Parliamentary and. Local Government).(&amp;) The conduct and costs of elections.(c) Methods of election.(d) Re-distribution of seats.Question (c) is more fully dealt with in paragraph 3 below and question (d)in paragraph 5. As regards (a) and (&amp;), it would seem that these terms ofreference would include all the other various questions which it might be desiredto consider, such as plural voting, the University and business premises franchises,assimilation of the Parliamentary and Local Government franchises, the activitiesof outside agencies, the use of motor cars, maximum expenditure allowable to candidates and the amount of the deposit.3. This suggested list of topics to be considered by the Speaker&apos;s Conferenceincludes, as (c), &quot;methods of election.&quot; There are two views on the questionwhether this topic which would of course embrace proportional representation should be included.On the one hand, it can be argued that factual knowledge on this question,such as would be embodied in the report of an expert or political enquiry, is[26197]
already available, and that Members have already made up their minds on thisquestion: on this view, it would be a waste of time to refer the subject of propor-tional representation to the Speaker&apos;s Conference, and the right course wouldbe to omit the subject from the proposed terms of reference and leave the advocates of proportional representation to propose its insertion, and to take a vote on suchan amendment possibly at the end of the first day&apos;s Debate.On the other hand, the view can be taken that it would not be right to exclude from a Speakers Conference one particular aspect of electoral reform, and thatthe Government might be accused of unfairly pre-judging the issue if it selected for exclusion this one item, which is by inference the subject of a Motion on theOrder Paper to which some 114 Members have put their names, although it isunderstood that not all of the 114 Members favour proportional representation.The view of the Ministerial Committee is that the question of methods of election should be one of those listed in the Government Motion for the settingup of the Speakers Conference; that it should be left to Members to propose,if they see fit. the deletion of this item; and that if a vote is taken on such an amendment, the Government Whips should not be put on.4. In W.P. (43) 304, I explained that the Ministerial Committee thought!?that a decision on the question whether or not there should be two separate Hills,dealing respectively with electoral registration and with redistribution, couldstand over until more information was available as to probable progress in preparing the necessary legislation. It is now clear that there would be greatpractical difficulties in completing the preparation of a comprehensive Bill,including provisions relating to redistribution, in time for early introduction. Inaddition, the provisions relating to redistribution are much more likely to raisecontroversy and discussion than the provisions relating to registration, and ifthere were one comprehensive Bill, there is some danger that the provisions relating to registration would be materially delayed. The Committee have accordingly come to the conclusion that it would be right to have two separate Bills,and thev have asked that the Bill relating to registration should be introduced at the earliest possible date. It has been approved by the Legislation Committee;and there should be sufficient Parliamentary time for it to be passed into law before the end of the present Session.5. I made a statement in the House of Commons on the 22ncl duly. 1943(Hansard, columns 1049-52), with the authority of the War Cabinet (W.M. (43)98th Conclusions, Minute 2). promising the introduction of legislation on thesubject of redistribution. It is clear that the problem of framing the directions to the Boundary Commissioners is going to be difficult much more difficult thanit was at the end of the last war. For instance, there will undoubtedly be aconsiderable movement of population when hostilities in Europe have ended;are the Boundary Commissioners, nevertheless, to base their proposals on theposition in each constituency on a particular date, or are they to attempt to fore-cast what the state of the constituency will be at a later date ? Some constituencieswhich, at the date of the enquiry, would not be entitled to keep their right to separate representation, would be able to claim that, in the near future, theywould again be large enough to warrant separate representation, whereas, on theother hand, there would be districts containing war factories and transferredworkers and evacuees which would be large enough, at the time of the enquiry,to warrant representation in Parliament, but which might be expected to shrinkvery considerably. The Appendix shows that the question of redistribution was referred to the Speaker&apos;s Conference in 1916, and there is now much to be said in favour of following this precedent and putting on to a Speaker&apos;s Conference,instead of on to individual Ministers, the responsibility of framing the instruc-tions to the Boundary Commissioners. In addition to the problem referred toabove as to the movement of population, there remain such controversial questions as the continuation of double Member constituencies and the question whether there should be any differentiation in the basis on which the representation ofdifferent parts of the United Kingdom is calculated.The suggestion has been made that it might be possible to introduce a Billembodying the machinery of redistribution set out in the DepartmentalCommittee&apos;s Report, but not including the instructions to the Boundary Commis-sioners on the understanding that the Speaker!s Conference would be asked asa matter of urgency to prepare these instructions for inclusion in the subsequentResolution appointing the Boundary Commissioners. This suggestion has beenfully considered, but our conclusion is that such a course would not be defensible.
The central purpose of the proposed redistribution Bill is to carry out therecommendation of the Departmental Committee by creating &quot;as a normal and regular part of the equipment of the Parliamentary system &quot; a standing body ofBoundary Commissioners charged with the duty of conducting periodic&apos; reviews of the state of the constituencies and submitting proposals, when necessary, forredistribution. Unless the statutory provisions for this new procedure contain a statement of the principles by which the Boundary Commissioners are to be guided in carrying out this duty, they will not effect this central purpose.If it were merely intended to appoint Boundary Commissioners to prepare inthe near future one ad hoc scheme of redistribution, no legislation would berequired; resolutions of Parliament approving the appointment of BoundaryCommissioners and the principles on which they are to prepare their ad hocscheme of redistribution would be sufficient. In order, however, to create standingmachinery which will operate from time to time in the future, there must belegislation; and this legislation would not effect the purpose in view unless it setout the principles by which the Boundary Commissioners are to be guided in(a) deciding, when they make periodic reviews of the state of the constituencies,whether some measure of redistribution is required, and (b) in preparing schemesof redistribution.The question has been considered whether it would be practicable to provide in the Bill that these principles should be embodied in some subsequent Order inCouncil, subject, say, to a positive resolution of Parliament, But such a coursewould not be appropriate. The subject-matter is of such a kind that theprovisions ought to be liable to debate and to amendment in Committee as part ofa Bill. A Bill which contained no such provisions would be so incomplete thatit could justifiably be criticised as a request to Parliament to sign something inthe nature of a blank cheque.It is accordingly suggested that the right course would be to prepare the heads of such a Bill as would be required to give effect to the machinery recom-mendations of the Departmental Committee, and to refer this document to the speaker&apos;s Conference for urgent consideration, with an indication that theGovernment is prepared to accept the &quot; machinery &quot; recommendations made inthe Report of the Departmental Committee, and asking for the guidance of theConference in framing the provisions which will be required for the purpose oflaying clown the general principles by which the Boundary Commissioners are tobe guided.The general question of redistribution has accordingly been included in the suggested list of topics to be referred to the Speakers Conference (see para-graph 2 above).6.   To summarise, I ask for approval to the following recommendation : (a) Facilities should be given for a two-days&quot; Debate in the House ofCommons on the electoral system early in the new Session. A Speaker&apos;conference should be appointed to consider questions of electoral reform and the Debate should take place on the Motion inviting the speaker to preside over a Conference. An announcement that this debate will be held should be made in the near future.I should be glad to have authority to inform the Speaker of whatis proposed.(b) The Motion for the setting up of a Speaker&apos;s Conference should include alist of the questions to be considered by the Conference.(c) This list should include methods of election (which would embrace pro-portional representation). It would be open to any Members to movean Amendment for the omission of this or any other item from the list.(d) The whole question of redistribution should also be referred to the speakers Conference for urgent consideration and early report,primarily with a view to obtaining the assistance of the Conference in framing the directions to the Boundary Commissioners.Signed on behalf of the Committee,5th October, 1943.HERBERT MORRISON.
