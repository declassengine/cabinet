THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 428.2nd October, 1943.WAR CABINET.CURRENCY TALKS  AT WASHINGTON:  EXCHANGE  STABILITY.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. An important question has arisen out of the discussions proceeding between our Delegation ancl the representatives of the American Treasury on theprocedure for securing a reasonable flexibility for exchanges within thet ramewor k of a policy for exchange stability.2. The directive to the Delegation is contained in W.P. (43) 383, particu-larly paragraph 5 (i) of Sir Kingsley WoocFs covering note, and paragraphs 7 (d)and 10 (iii) of the Memorandum by the Treasury. The general directive was approved in the Conclusions of the War Cabinet on the 2nd September, 121 (43),in the following terms :  &quot; While countries should retain a reasonable measure of elasticity over their own exchange rates, an endeavour should be made to ensure that decisions to modifv exchange rates were taken by reference to some objectivetest.&quot;3. The original Clearing Union scheme and both published versions of theAmerican Stabilisation Fund scheme contemplated fairly precise rules governing the adjustment of exchanges. The previous discussions between our officials andthe American Treasury had made it clear that those rules were too rigid to fit thefacts; some qualification would be necessary, particularly for the transitional period and for the problem of the liberated territories. Our Delegation were not given a more precise indication of the principles on which the arrangements mightbe made because the question forms part of the general structure of the scheme,and there were also questions of preliminary tactics in the discussions which the delegation would have to decide for themselves.4. The preliminary discussions in Washington on this matter ancl the&quot; tentative proposals &quot; submitted in writing to the Americans by our Delegationabout the 17th September are shown in Abide 4173 ancl 4174 (iVppendix A).These telegrams were considered by the Treasury and the Board of Trade in con-sultation with the Bank of England. It was agreed that an automatic adjustment of exchange rates by reference to objective statistics on the balance of payments was impracticable; even in our own country, where the technique of exchange control is well developed, complete data have not yet been evolved.In agreement with the Board of Trade, the Treasury sent a telegram, 6356(Appendix A), on the 22nd September, raising questions about the merits of theproposal and the difficult matter of the procedure for approval. The Delegationreplied on the 24th September in telegrams Abide 4274 ancl 4275 (Appendix A).5. The draft telegram to Washington, Appendix B. represents the view which I took upon the matter. I arranged that this draft should be consideredby all the Departments interested, many of whom, however, are disposed to theview that the proposals in 4f74 represent a reasonable flexibility for us and reasonable protection against unchecked depreciation by other countries, andthat the undeniable difference between the way of approach in Appendix B and[&quot;26174] b
the proposals in 4174 might embarrass our Delegation, and might, even be regarded by the Americans as evidence that we were retreating from the policy of trying to hold the international exchange position pretty firmly.6. While these arguments must be carefully weighed. 1 am impressed also by other considerations governing this matter which 1 should like to develop tomy colleagues.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.2nd October. 1943.APPENDIX A.From Washington to Foreign Office, dated IQth September, 1943.(No. 4173.   Abide.)Following for Treasury from Keynes : In preliminary discussions before the first meeting of the Joint Anglo-American Committee the British currency delegation considered what proposals we should make with a view to retaining freedom for individual countries to vary their exchange rate at need while still giving proper recognition to theprinciple of stability. We explored the possibility of a precise objective test orformula which, if its requirements were satisfied, would confer upon a member country an undisputed right to vary its rate. We concluded that no preciseformula could be devised which would have a hope of working in practice, butthat certain objective tests of a more general character might be specificallyprescribed, and that this in combination with a limited unfettered discretionand an emergency right to act in absence of approval might meet the case.2.   Our tentative proposals are given in my immediately following telegram.3. At the meeting with the Americans I emphasised our belief in theprinciple of exchange stability, but outlined the political and economic objections which were felt very strongly on our side to any attempt to enshrine the principle in rigid obligations. After sketching our own tentative ideas we handed our proposals to the Americans as an informal note of suggestions which had occurred to  some members of the British delegation, but which had not been referred toLondon and should not be regarded as having any authoritative approval or asbeing more than a starting point for discussion.4.   White&apos;s preliminary reaction was not favourable.(a) The United States Treasury desired to avoid rigidity and recognised the part which flexibility must play in any international scheme.(b) He was strongly against any precise objective formula, and said thattheir own conclusion was that it would be wiser to rely on the collectivejudgment of those in charge of the international institution. But he did not appear to object to our more general criteria.(6-) He recognised that any public discussion of a contemplated movementin rates was out of the question, but felt sure that in practice anymovement in a major currency would be discussed beforehand betweenthe three or four major Treasuries. It was inconceivable that therewould not be ample warning of a need for such a move and previous discussion in the Press. He could not see the objection to providingin the rules confidential discussions which would be bound to occur inany case. A suggestion was made and pursued by the Americans thatprior consultation should not be limited to the Chairman, but should extend either to the Executive Committee, which would be in constantsession and of limited membership, or to a standing Sub-Committeeof the Executive. The Americans appear to have moved away fromthe idea of discussions in full session requiring specific majority votes,but we did not press them to reconcile their new view with the published draft rules of the stabilisation fund.
(d) While White maintained that confidential discussions between theleading members of the fund could not. give rise to speculation, heargued that speculation would in practice be held in check by theexchange controls which he recognised must remain in existencethroughout most of the world. He distinguished between exchangecontrols ancl exchange restrictions. Controls he envisaged as amachinery of scrutiny which would be maintained even by countriesin a strong position, but would normally be administered with thegreatest possible leniency. If, however, a country found itself getting[ ? group omitted : ? into] difficulties, the control machinery would be administered with increasing strictness to enforce the necessaryexchange restrictions for so long as they might be required.(c) So criticism was offered of the indefinite extension in point of time ofthe unfette?&apos;ed 10 per cent, discretion or of a bare majority beingsufficient for the approval of changes.5. No attempt was made to reach conclusions. The Americans do not propose to give us their considered reactions until after they have all oursuggestions before them.(5. Please inform us as soon as may be whether the note in my immediately following telegram has your general approval. We hope that our treatment ofobjective tests goes far enough. The American reaction to these proposals seemedfavourable, but they expressed relief that we did not ask for precise arithmeticalformulas, which would clearly have met with severe criticism.From Washington to Foreign Office, dated 17th September, 1943.(Xo. 4174.   Abide.)Following for Treasury from Keynes :  My immediately preceding telegram.Following is text lognote :  Exchange rates. 1. Members shall agree not to propose changes in exchange value of their currency unless they consider it essential to correction of funda-mental disequilibrium in their balance of payments, and changes shall be made only with approval of the fund subject to qualifications below.2. Fund shall not withhold its approval if proposed change inclusive ofany previous changes since establishment of fund does not exceed 10 per cent,with last ten years.3. A country which has exhausted its facilities under 2, and desires afurther change in par value of its currency in terms of unitas shall, if possible,explain its reasons to fund beforehand and seek funcEs prior approval. Fund,in giving or withholding approval, shall act. in accordance with following principles : (a) It shall take account of changes in relative money costs ofproduction in country making application, ancl shall allow an appropriate changeif it appears that increase in relative costs has led to an over-valuation of currency, (b) It shall also take into account balance of payments of countrymaking application with rest of world, and shall allow an appropriate changeif balance on current account, together with inward long-term capital trans-actions, has (measured as a percentage of its foreign trade) been seriously adverseover a period, or if country&apos;s remaining holding of liquid reserves (measured asa percentage of its quota) is inadequate, provided always that proposed alteration in the exchange seems likely to improve position, (c) Application by a member to appreciate its exchanges shall be similarly considered mutatis mutandis,(d) The fund shall not be entitled to refuse a change on ground of social or political policies which may have led to situation, and shall approve a change which in the de facto situation would tend to restore equilibrium.4. If circumstances are such that it is not practicable to obtain fund&apos;s prior approval to a change, a member shall be entitled if necessary, after consulting-chairman, to make a change not exceeding 10 per cent, without seeking funcfsprior approval, in which case it shall immediately seek funcEs confirmingapproval. If fund is unable to approve change by a majority vote, the country shall have option of reversing it ancl of conforming to views of fund or shailwithdraw from membership without further notice given.[26174]
Foreign Office to Washington, dated 22nd September, 1943.(No. 6356.   Abide.)Following for Revues from Treasury :  Your telegrams Nos. 4173 and 4174 [Exchange Rates].1. It is not clear from paragraphs 4 and 6 of 4173 whether Americansdislike the objective criteria suggested by you, which seems to us on sound lines,or the principle of an appeal to objective data as justification for alteringexchanges in place of reliance upon collective judgment of executive committee!But in either case their present attitude underrates difficulty of persuadingParliament that in an instrument which is to have something of the sanctity ofa Treaty the Government should surrender the right to protect employment byexchange adjustment, which is regarded in many quarters as appropriatedefensive action. Similar point is bound to be raised by other countries such asHolland, Belgium. France and Latin American countries, and we should have expected Congress also to take it. If the main clause dealing with exchange rates were to be too rigid, there would be a risk of insistence or great emphasis onescape provision or that acceptance would be subject to undisclosed reservations.Neither situation would be satisfactory as we think you will agree thatgenuineness of approach is essential to this part of proposed international set-up.2. At present tentative stage of discussions instructions to you areundesirable, but you ought to know our reaction to American attitude as \vt:understand it from your telegrams.3. There is an obvious relation between the clause dealing with exchangeadjustments and the general form of the whole scheme. The present publishedAmerican scheme may remain in the background of your present discussions, butwe assume that it still is in existence. It could be represented as having theappearance of a gold standard scheme, and precise exchange obligation in sucha scheme would be regarded as tying us to a gold standard dollar.4. It is not clear from paragraph 10 of your Abide 4125 at what da itsand by what stages after the war the scheme is to come into operation. the range of exchange adjustments which is permissible could be much more easilyseen when we know something about the relative levels of prices and production costs that will follow upon the early unsettled post-war period. Several Europeanshave expressed view that initial exchange rates would have to be experimentalWe agree with this, and in such circumstances precise definition of ranges of adjustment seems to us unwise at this stage.5. The reality of the conditions under which consultation would be conductedmust be appreciated by White. It is true that in countries which retain exchange control the draining away of resources which normally precedes exchangeadjustment could to a considerable extent be checked. But if situation is developing where a major adjustment of exchange rates is on the horizon exchange control would soon show itself an imperfect instrument. In such a situationconsultation would have to be very speedy and very confidential. So long as thecentral monetary authority is not manifestly disturbed, exchange values couldbe reasonably held with the help of exchange control. But once it leaks out that discussions are proceeding which would be likely to lead to an exchangeadjustment of significance, pressure upon exchange value would becomeinsistent. Moreover, White&apos;s idea seems to us to presuppose free dealingseven in currencies which are subject to control, and any major currency would therefore be open to attack during consultation. We think it would be wiserfor the moment to put aside detailed definitions and to be content with a clauseby which member countries agree not to make changes in the exchange value oftheir currency unless they consider it essential to correction of fundamentaldisequilibrium in their balance of payments, and then only after consultationwith the appropriate committee of the Board. We should hope undertakings to consult would lie more effective in practice than obligation to obtain formalapproval. Moreover, we believe that at this stage it would not be practicable toobtain agreement that changes should be subject to approval by any system of voting of the governing body. The clause could also have a descriptive statementof the objective conditions that might constitute evidence of the fundamentaldisequilibrium on the lines of paragraph 3 of your 4174.
From Washington to Foreign Office, dated 23rd September, 1943.(No. 4274.   Abide.)Following for Treasury from Keynes : Your telegram No. 6356.indications are that the Americans will accept, subject to only minor modifications to the principles laid down in paragraph 3 of my 4174. What theydisliked was any attempt to make these criteria arithmetically precise, a view with which we have considerable sympathy.2. We are not overlooking the consideration urged in your paragraph 3.White has now had all our substantial proposals and the Joint Group will havehad them by tomorrow. We will emphasise again that they all hang together in our minds and difficulty about any one of them might have repercussions on other points, since each of our detailed suggestions has to take in the framework of our suggestions as a whole.3. Your paragraph 4, which has arrived possibly corrupt. We felt that thedifficulties of the initial period would be sufficiently met by unqualified discretion to make 10 per cent, change. Our proposals, however, were mainly concerned withlonger term. We might strengthen the provision relating to the early periodwith a clause similar to the concluding passage of Clearing Union 6 (3).4. We are not clear how far the last sentence but three of your paragraph 5,in conjunction with your paragraph 6, qualifies readiness to accept draft proposals in my 4174. Our latest impression is that the Americans will accept the wholeof these proposals subject only to minor modifications. The above sentence ofyour paragraph 5 would modify paragraph 4 of my 4174 in two respects. Itwould allow [group undecypherable] the right of action to the Fund if its adviceis disregarded and would apply unilateral changes of any size. It would bea very drastic change to propose that every country should be free to makeunlimited unilateral alterations in its exchange merely after consultation. all of us here think that the proposals of 4174 give sufficient elasticity and independence and would be sorry to have to go back so completely on the idea of having some definite rules to preserve exchange stability. Our draft alreadypreserves an ultimate freedom of action to [group undecypherable : ? every]member. Please let us know very urgently if we are to withdraw the proposalsof my 4174, which, unless we have misunderstood your telegram under reference,seems to us more in conformity with the Cabinet directive. If we are to withdrawthem wc should not delay in doing so. We fear the effect of withdrawal ondiscussion as a whole, which is exceedingly satisfactory. White has indicated to me privately that in the last resort he would not resist any of our fundamental principles as so far propounded to him, provided that we are successful in persuading his colleagues.6. We are in general agreement with the idea in (c) of paragraph 4 of 4173that in the ultimate analysis all the issues involved in the whole scheme will rest upon the judgment and competence of the management of the scheme. We suggestthat it is not inconsistent with this view that, for the starting period, we shouldbe content with a firm statement of adherence to the principle of exchangestability and agreement to consult before making change. As the situationdevelops the management would doubtless be able to elaborate closer definitionsto which member Slates would be willing to agree.7. Paragraph 5 of your 4173. You and your colleagues must be judges ofthe development of tactics in the discussions, but we do not want to slide into aposition in which each suggestion we make is put forward in detail apart fromo-eneral consideration of the whole scheme, so that the Americans may attempt to dispose of each one separately without proper regard to the shape of the scheme as a whole. You are fully aware of this, and we mention the point only becauseyour express reference to us of the problem of exchange rates has come ratherin isolation.
From Washington to Foreign Office, dated 23rd September, 1943.(No. 4275.   Abide.)My immediately preceding-telegram.Following from Waley :  With the permission of Keynes I would like to set out my views. To complywith the Cabinet instructions we have (a) To avoid being forced to deflate if His Majesty&apos;s Government should atany time think, rightly or wrongly, that it would be better todepreciate and that this would avoid deflation.(b) To prevent other countries depreciating for competitive reasons on thepretext that this would correct a disequilibrium when by some test asobjective as possible it could be shown that this pretext was not justified.(c) To avoid bear speculation which would be caused by formal consultationwith fund beforehand. It seemed to me that on the wdiole our proposals met all three points.A. Apart from special latitude which might be necessary in the immediate post-war period, it seems to me that it will be a very important achievement ifwe can secure freedom to depreciate to the extent of 10 per cent, unilaterally.B. Obstacles to further depreciation without real justification seems to measures effective and as objective as could be hoped.C. Arrangements for making changes without consulting the fund before-hand seems to me to avoid the danger of bear speculation.2: I am surprised to find so little emphasis in your telegram on the dangerof depreciation by other countries for inadequate reasons. At first reading the promise to depreciate only in order to correct disequilibrium, and then only afterconsultation, seems more attractive than our proposal from the point of view of avoiding any appearance of again crucifying ourselves on the cross of gold orsubmitting our affairs to the decision of an untried international body. But Ithink that this appearance is to some extent deceptive. In practice in view ofour position in the world and our intimate relations with the United States, itwill be very difficult indeed for us to depreciate unless the committee of the fundapprove. It will be far easier for many other countries to disregard the advice of the fund.3. The prospect that the Americans will agree to the terms of the proposalstaken as a whole appears unexpectedly favourable. This particular point mustbe judged against that of the general background. Taking a severelv practical point of view, our proposals give us completely free hand to depreciate to theextent of 10 per cent, and another 10 per cent, without the necessity of securingcommittee&apos;s approval whilst laying down satisfactory rules on circumstances inwhich countries should or should not be allowed to depreciate further. Yourproposal in practice might well mean that we could never depreciate at allwithout obtaining prior approval of the fund or its committee whilst others will feel less embarrassment in acting against the wishes of the fund.4. Even if you are not at all convinced by these arguments the positionprobably is that we may have the choice of some international monetary arrange-ment on lines of our present proposals or no international monetary arrangementat all. The general view among the Americans here is that if we fail to reach agreement on monetary arrangements there is much less chance of reaching any definite understanding about commercial policy, in which field there is also anunexpectedly large measure of agreement between American views and those ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.
APPENDIX B.To Washington.(Abide 4274 and 4275.)1. Question has been considered by Ministers. While present discussions are, and remain, non-committal so far as Government is concerned, you would wish when important issues define themselves to know what Ministers believeParliament would accept. Moreover, circumstances out of which present discussions arose put upon us some responsibility for considering position ofother countries. We do not want situation to develop where we and Americans(    are expected to railroad an agreement through reluctant United Nations.2. We appreciate fully the intention of your proposals in 4174 that each country should have limited unilateral rights giving reasonable flexibility, butthat unilateral rights should not lead to unchecked irresponsibility.8. The two issues raised by your proposals are whether proposed rules are suitable and whether procedure of approval or consultation is to be preferred.4. But there is a third issue : Whether there should not be clear distinctionbetween rules and procedure appropriate to transitional post-war period andthose appropriate to later position.5. It is generally agreed that for many countries initial post-war ratesmust, be experimental. Revised Stabilisation Fund scheme recognised problemof liberated territories, and Clearing Union scheme recognises difficulties of transitional period. We think it quite premature to estimate now whetherpermissible range of 10 per cent, will meet inevitable adjustments of experimentalrates. If any such figure were inserted at this stage it would have to besurrounded by numerous qualifications for liberated territories and other problems and the quoted percentage would have little real meaning. the instrument creating the currency organisation is to have something of the sanctityof a Treaty and all conditions bound to precise figures would need to be lookedai very closely in order to make sure that the figure would stand up to unexpecteddevelopments. Change of any figure in the instrument might obviously involvecomplicated and long-drawn-out procedure.6. While we agree that as between ourselves and United States the practicaldifference between consultation with the Board and approval of the Board isqualified by argument in paragraph 2 of 4275, the difference in form betweenconsultation and approval is real. We cannot yet know the size of the Board orthe constitution that will emerge. Approval must contemplate possibilities of difference of opinion on Board, and therefore must provide voting procedure.Quite apart from our belief, which we know you share, that important businessof the Board cannot really be conducted by voting, all questions of voting on thismatter will raise Parliamentary difficulties, and also probably difficulties withother countries. Most countries have recollections of decisive voting influence atGeneva of countries often remotely concerned with effect of issues before manyLeague Committees.7. The third issue mentioned in paragraph 4 raises question when it ishoped that international currency organisation might be in operation. Despiteobvious difficulties we believe thai it is highly desirable that organisation shouldbe in existence as early as possible in the transitional period and should be ableto gain experience and exercise influence in the difficulties of that period. This,in our judgment, probably entails setting Board up with limited powers of formalapproval but with wide and growing powers of influence, leaving the Board asit gains experience on this difficult territory to develop more precise rules. Ifthe Board acts wisely and cautiously it will gain general acceptance and its position will become very strong. We do not believe that its position will be made any stronger by premature grant to it of specific powers of detailed approval and disapproval.8. In the light of the foregoing we restate for you the views we should wishyou to urge strongly upon the American representatives : (a) There should be definite agreement to accept stability of exchanges asfoundation of international economic relations.(b) Exchange adjustment should be in accordance with objective principles.We agree with American view that precise mathematical tests are probably impracticable and certainly premature at this stage.   You
will recognise difficulty of providing unchallengeable data on balanceof payments even with our own elaborate technique of exchange control. We like the objective principles in your 4174 and think theycould well be enshrined in text of instrument.(c) We should wish to see Board in existence as early as possible aftertermination of hostilities and able to exercise influence upon theproblem of exchanges in transitional period.(d) There should be agreement in the instrument that no adjustment ofexchange rates shall be made except after consultation with the Board,though not subject to the Board&apos;s approval. It is for discussionwhether the initial exchange rates fixed should be subject to consulta-tion with the Board or only subject to notification. We would haveno objection to consultation, though it would have to be recognised thatthe views of the member countries on the experimental rates would normally have to be accepted. We would much rather introduce the doctrine of consultation from the beginning than a mathematicalrange of adjustment allowed without consultation.9. At the conclusion of 5 years from the setting up of the Board or at suchearlier period as might be agreed upon by the member countries, the Board shouldbe required to formulate for consideration by member countries rules governingprocedure for adjustment of exchanges. At that stage it might well be possibleto introduce ranges of adjustment such as you contemplate, ancl certainly it mightbe practicable to provide for more formal approval by the Board if satisfactoryprocedure for rapid action could be evolved.10. We hope you will not feel that this approach to a crucial probleminvolves a withdrawal from the tentative proposals in 4174 which would embarrassyou in your discussions. You will see that we have tried to put our policy in a positive manner which you could urge upon the American representatives. Onthese lines we believe we could carry influential opinion not confined to thiscountry.
