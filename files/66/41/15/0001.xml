An area of devastation is seen to the S.W. of thecentre of Munchen-Gladbach, and in Rheydt a large area of business and residential property has been almost entirely destroyed. (See Print No. 1.) Atleast 30 factories were destroyed or seriously damaged.Berlin (31st August/1st September, 3rd/4th September).Weather was unfavourable for the first of these raids. Markers were notwell concentrated and a scattered attack to the S.W. of the aiming pointdeveloped.The attack on the 3rd/4th September was well, concentrated and did heavy damage in the N.W. quarter of the city.The results of these and previous raids on Berlin are described later in the summary.[26121] b
Targets in A. France.Ammunition dumps and other military installations in N France were attacked on four occasions by Wellingtons from operational squadrons andO.T.XJs, Results against this type of target can rarely be assessed with u,yaccuracy even when day photographs are available.Mannheim (5th/6th September).Although Mannheim had experienced 27 previous attacks in which over4,500 tons of bombs had been dropped, many of these had been carried out underbad weather conditions or with relatively small forces and the damage causedhad never amounted to the wholesale devastation to be expected from a heavy attack with the present force. The attack by 605 aircraft on the 5th/6th Septem-ber took place in excellent conditions and crews&apos; reports and plots of nightphotographs showed that it was most successful. Fires were seen by recon-naissance aircraft to.be still burning two days after the attack.Day photographs obtained on the 9th September showed 330 acres ofbusiness and residential property devastated, mostly in the inner town, as wellas considerable damage to factory buildings, warehouses and railway properly.Pinnt No. 2 shows damage in the dock area. Among many factories damaged the following are the most important : Heinrich Lanz (tractors and tank components).Raschig (miscellaneous chemicals).Sulzer Bros, (marine diesel engines).Doth the main station at Mannheim and that at Ludwigshafen were badly damaged and manv warehouses were gutted.Munich (6th/7th September).It was thought from preliminary reports that this attack had achieved con-siderable success, but plots of night photographs indicate that, although a goodconcentration was achieved with the help of navigational aids, the bombs fellmainly in suburban and scattered industrial areas. Day photographs have notyet been obtained.Results of Previous Raids.Berlin.Day photographs show that in the recent raids very serious damage was done and many important industrial undertakings badly hit. Residential ancl com-mercial property also suffered widespread damage.The principal undertakings which are now seen to have been hit, the majorityof them severely, are : Sieinensstadt -Siemens-Halske A.G. (electrical apparatus).Charlottenburg A.E.G. Turbines.Charlottenburg Gas Works.Ges. fur Elektrische Unternehmungen Loewe (machine tools).Ford Auto Dienst.Berliner Anhaltischer Machinenbau A.G. (constructional engineers).Cassirer and Co. A.G. (electrical cables).Mariendorf Mariendorf Gas Works.Askania Werke A.G. (precision instruments).&apos; Marienfelde Daimler Benz A.G.Fritz Werner A.G. (milling and grinding machines).Schdnefeld Henschel Flugzeugwerke A.G -(aircraft).A very large new unidentified factory in Spandau was also hit. Prints Nos. 3and 4 show some of the damage.
Ground sources report several incidents to railway property, includingdamage done to stations at Lankwitz, Charlottenburg and the Zoo, and state thattram services in S.W. Berlin was seriously curtailed as a result of the attack onthe 23rd/24th August. Mass evacuation and partial breakdown of the supplyservices produced temporary administrative chaos.Jena.Further information on the results of the Mosquito attack on the Zeissfactory on the 27th May shows the serious dislocation which it caused. Produc-tion fell by 25 per cent, for 4 weeks, and it was 3 months before normal production was restored.Mining.. The following mining successes are reported : 5th August.   The fishing vessel Olga was mined and sunk south offHjelm (S.W. corner of the Kattegat).8th August.   The German schooner Lamdkirchen was damaged nearTolkedyb Light Buoy. Great Belt.17th August.   The fishing vessel N. 314 Margrethe was mined and sunk off Aske.
