THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST&apos;Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It js issued for the personal use ofWAR CABINET.ECONOMIC SITUATION IN INDIA.Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff.ON the 16th August the Secretary of State for India presented a paper onthe economic situation in India to the Cabinet Committee&quot; on Indian financial questions which disclosed an extremely disquieting- situation, the continuation of which would jeopardise the security of India as a base for operations inSouth-East Asia.Among the problems to which he drew attention was the critical food situationin India. This had been considered* by the War Cabinet on the 4th August inrelation to a recommendationt by the Secretary of State for India that500,000 tons of wheat should be imported into India between September 1943and February 1944. The War Cabinet agreed* to provide shipping for up to100,000 tons of barley from Iraq and to make preliminary arrangements for thedespatch, if necessary, of 50.000 tons of wheat from Australia.On the 13th August the Viceroy telegraphed warning the Cabinet in the mostsolemn terms that, unless the appropriate help.was received, the Government ofIndia could not be responsible for the continuing stability of India iioav, nor forher capacity to serve as a base against Japan next year. Annexed is an extractfrom G.H.Q., India, Weekly Intelligence Summary which illustrates theappalling conditions in Eastern Bengal and Assam.Commander-in-Chief, India, has pointed out from time to time the seriousoperational implications inherent in the situation, and on the 2nd August hesaid that it was of the highest importance, from the strategical and general military point of view, that the Government of India should receive all possibleaid in dealing with the food situation.He has now telegraphed again in even stronger terms. He points out in this telegram that, although food may exist in sufficient quantity in India, it isimpossible to ensure fair distribution because of the low standard of adminis-tration in the country a.s well as the weakness of the communication systemgenerally and the lack of an informed and strong public opinion.The Secretary of State for India has made it clear that the food problem is only one symptom of a generally unsatisfactory economic situation. Weconsider that we would be failing in our duty to the War Cabinet if we did notpoint out that, unless the necessary steps are taken to rectify this situation, the efficient prosecution of the war against Japan by forces based on India will be gravely jeopardised and may well prove impossible. If it should transpire that,as Commander-in-Chief, India, and the Government of India consider, a necessary step in this direction is the diversion of shipping to the transportingof food grains to India, then the operational implications of an administrativebreakdown in India will have to be given full weight.* W.M.

It may very well be that these food crises will be a constantly recurringfeature unless steps are taken to bolster up the present Indian administrativesystem by every possible means, including the reinfusion of considerable numbersof European personnel. But that does not alter the fact that urgent steps arenecessary to deal with this particular crisis, and, so far as we can see, to importadditional food at once is the only way of doing this.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.C. PORTAL.E. N. SYFRET.ANNEX.Extract from G HQ., India, Weekly Intelligence Summary No. 94, dated20th A ugust, 1943 Part III, Security Intelligence.Internal.^ ^&quot;P -J?- ^5. A special report on conditions in East Bengal and Assam indicates thatfamine conditions are now rife in those districts. In Chittagong. A.R.P.personnel have had to rake over the daily removal of corpses from streets and houses. In Dacca, the poor are living on what rice water they can get, since eventhe rich are unable to obtain rice. Cholera, small-pox and starvation are causinghundreds of deaths daily in the surrounding villages. Similar conditions prevailover a large area of East Bengal, and have given rise to a widespread incidence of thefts and dacoities.   Suicides and child-selling have been reported.6. Such conditions, though at their worst in these districts, are not confined to the North-East. A British resident on an estate in Mysore writes that it is dangerous to walk through the estate now. as they are having trouble over food.Thousands of Indian workers are starving. At a time when Government areurging the estates to increase their output of rubber, many estates in Travancorehave had to stop working owing to supplies of rice being insufficient to feedtheir labour. In planting districts in Coorg coolies die by the wayside ofstarvation.7. Labour. In the Calcutta area there have been numerous strikes in mills and factories and, though the majority of these strikes have been short-lived, the cumulative effect on war production has been considerable. Workers&apos; demands inall cases have centred, round the supply of food grains at reasonable prices, andwhen this demand has been met the situation has rapidly returned to normal. on existing evidence it appears that the strikers are influenced by purely economic,and not political, motives.8. Fires and Labour Troubles. There has long been reason to suspect thatfires in military installations are not unconnected with labour unrest due to continue distress amongst the staff. This suspicion has been strengthened by thefact that in one Ordnance Depot, where small fires formerly occurred with someregularity, adequate measures for the provision of grains for the workers havebeen accompanied by a complete cessation of fires.9. Axis Radio. The following extract is taken from the &quot; Azad Hind&quot;news in Tamil for the 14th August, relayed from Germany : &quot; It is reported that the Indian Independence League at Bangkok hasdecided to enlist the help of Japan, Thailand and Burma to export rice toIndia and thus improve the food-situation. Though it is normally impossibleto send, rice to India from Japanese occupied territory, the league isprepared to do so if the British Government approves the proposal and givesan undertaking that the food so sent will not be reserved for military con-sumption or exported from India. This gesture of the league is expressiveof the sympathy of Indians in East Asia and their desire to relieve the offices of the War Cabinet,nth September, 1943.
suffering of their Indian brethren. If the British do not accept this generousoffer they will be betraying their true intentions.&quot;% ^ $fc %t ^ %r11. In view of the prevailing economic conditions in India, the danger ofthis type of propaganda and the embarrassment it might cause should, it reach the people affected, need not be stressed, The effect of such statements on thearmy must also be considered especially if put out by enemy forward propagandaunits, or after capture, to Indian troops on the Eastern frontier. Many Indiansoldiers serving in East India have seen the famine conditions prevailing therefor themselves, and Indian soldiers in general are already apprehensive of theeffects of food shortages upon their families.******15. The avowed intention of Congress to attack the staunchness of the soldier through the medium of his family, is only to be expected. else wherein the summary reference is made to Axis broadcasts, purporting to offer ricefrom Japanese occupied territories to starving India; every anti-Allied anddisruptive agency may be expected similarly to exploit India&apos;s food difficulties to the utmost. In this connection, a formation report from Chittagong statesthat men (both British and Indian) are so affected by the sights they see aroundthem, that they are feeding beggars with their own rations, even though theyare disobeying orders by so doing. The general feeling amongst Indian troopsis that immediate assistance must be given to the people of Chittagong, and thatthe Sirkar has already failed in its duty.
