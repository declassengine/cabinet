SECRET. .   / Copy No.W.P. (43) 444.mh October, 1943.WAR CABINET.SCOPE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE POLITICO-military commission.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.^ I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the drafts of two telegrams which I propose to address to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Washington and moscow instructing them to communicate to the United States and Soviet Govern-ments, for consideration at the Foreign Secretaries&apos; Conference, a memorandumdefining the scope and functions of the Politico-Military Commission which will shortly meet at Algiers, together with certain supplementary observations.A. E.Foreign Office, Qth October, 1943.Draft telegrams to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Moscow and washington.MY immediately following telegram contains the text of a draft memo-randum defining the scope and functions of the Politico-Military commission which should be communicated to the Soviet/United States Government as aproposal under Item 2 of our agenda.2. In our draft the work of the Commission is confined for the present to italian affairs. I have not overlooked that the Soviet Government have proposedthat the Commission should also deal with the problem of Axis satellites who maydissociate themselves from Germany and with the question of liberated Alliedterritory in Europe. His Majesty&apos;s Government are in favour of. these subjectsbeing remitted to an Inter-Allied Commission. Their only doubt is whether aCommission sitting in Algiers or elsewhere in the Mediterranean area would bewell placed to study these questions. They think that, if the Commission is tohave this wider scope, and if, as is probable, still further matters are referred toit in the future, it would be better to establish it in London, where a number ofother Allied Governments are established. This could be done after it hadacquainted itself with the Italian problem and made its first recommendations.Italian matters could thereafter be handled by a sub-Commission of four sub-ordinate representatives, which could continue to meet in Algiers.3. It would be for consideration whether or not the French Committee ofNational Liberation should be permanently represented on the LondonCommission.4. Please communicate the draft memorandum to the Soviet/United StatesGovernment, adding the observations contained in the present telegram.(2)Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram : The Politico-Military Commission will be composed of representatives ofthe United Kingdom, United States, the Soviet Union, and the French Committeeof National Liberation.   These representatives will be assisted, if necessary, by service advisers.  The Commission will meet for the present at Algiers.12175   [26207]Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.
It will deal in the first instance with problems relating to Italy.The members of the Commission will be supplied by the Three governments and by the French Committee of National Liberation with all relevant informa-tion on political and military developments affecting their work, and they willin their turn report on local developments. They will make joint or severalrecommendations to the Three Governments or to the Committee of Liberation,but will not have power to take final decisions. They will not, of course, intervene in the military functions of the Allied Commander-in-Chief.The other European Allied Governments will, at the discretion of theCommission, have access to the Commission when matters especially affecting their interests are under consideration.As experience is gained of the Commission^ work, its functions can be moreexactly defined. If its scope increases it will be necessary to reconsider thequestion of its location.The following indications are given of the treatment of the question atpresent remitted to the Commission : Italy. The Commission will keep itself closely informed of current Italianaffairs. For this purpose it will maintain close touch with the Allied Commander-in-Chief and will have the right to ask him for information or explanations on matters affecting its work. It will also have access to the Control Commission for italy and to such other inter-Allied bodies, whether political, economic or military,as may be established either for the purpose of ensuring the execution of the termslaid down for Italy, or of exercising supervision and control in the sphere of civil affairs. In the light of this information and of their joint examination thereof,the members of the Commission will tender advice on Italian affairs to their governments, either collectively or individually, informing the allied commander-in-Chief if they think it appropriate.The Allied Commander-in-Chief will continue, as in the past, to receiveinstructions from the United Kingdom and United States Governments throughthe Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington.
