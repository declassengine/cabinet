MADAGASCAR.1. Operations to complete the occupation of Madagascar began early on the morning of the 10th. Landings were made at three points on the west coast of the island, viz., Nosi Be, Majunga and Morondava. At the same time twocolumns from Diego Suarez advanced southwards from the southern boundary of the occupied area.2. At the island of Nosi Be, there were slight enemy casualties whenH.M. ships Manxman and Caradoc bombarded, the areas commanding the pier.Subsequently a detachment of Pretoria Highlanders was pulled ashore in cuttersby Royal Marines and by mid-day the town of Helleviile had surrendered.3. At Majunga, landings were made at three points in or near the town, at only one of which was there any resistance. No naval bombardment was necessary and the town surrendered at about 0645 hours. Five tugs, eleven lighters and asmall sugar boat were captured in the harbour. Within a few hours of the assault, leading elements of our forces had advanced 50 miles along the road toTananarive, and by 0930 on the 11th had reached the great suspension bridgeover the Betsiboka River,, 140 miles from Majunga. There they found, the cablescut and the centre span lowered into the water. Infantry were able to cross,however, and a bridgehead wras secured. Maevetanana was occupied on the 12thand by that afternoon the aerodrome at Majunga was in use by our aircraft.Operations are now proceeding in the direction of Andriba, some 110 miles fromTananarive.4. At Morondava the landing carried out by -a Commando unit from.M. destroyer Napier was a diversionary one and the town capitulated withoutresistance. One naval aircraft from H.M.S. Illustrious crashed on landing andanother was slightly damaged. Several harbour craft were captured. This force was recalled, on the afternoon of the 11th.5. The advance of the two columns from Diego Suarez was delayed bybroken bridges, but by the evening of the 11th one column had occupiedVohemar on the north-east coast about 100 miles from Diego Suarez. The second column, after overcoming some slight resistance to the north of Ambanjia,occupied the town on the 12th. The southward advance was continued, towardsMaromandia and the pressure of this column, combined with a further successfullanding to the sOuth of Maromandia on the 14th, enforced the surrender of allthe French troops in this area on the 15th.6. On the 16th the Governor-General asked for armistice terms and the vichy plenipotentiaries came to Majunga. It is reported on the 17th that theyhad refused, the terms.NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.7.   Light naval forces suffered considerable losses in a raid on Tobruk.Twelve ships, out of a total of 41 in a convoy at present on passage to archangel, have been lost by U-boat and air attack.Our light forces have been active in the Channel and off the Dutch coast.A U-boat was sunk in the Mediterranean, while a number of promisingattacks were made in other areas. &quot;...Two of H.M. Canadian Ships were sunk by U-boats in West Atlantic.Shipping losses were heavy.Home Waters.8. During the night of the 10th/11th our light craft had several engage-ments with enemy forces off the Dutch coast, during which a 2,000-ton vessel was sunk. An enemy armed trawler and some E and R-boats were severely damaged.One M.G.B. was sunk.H.M. Destroyers Cleveland, Bleasdale and trawlers were engaged inrounding-up French tunny fishing vessels on the 11th and 12th in the area west of the Scilly Islands.Four M.G.B.S. operating off the Hook of Holland on the night of the14th/15th, engaged and damaged two enemy vessels of 700 and 500 tons, andsubsequently damaged four enemy trawlers.
Naval aircraft operating in the Dover area on anti-minelaying patrol, sank an E-boat on the 15th.West Atlantic.9. H.M. Canadian Corvette Charlottetown was sunk by U-boat in the entrance to the St. Lawrence on the 11th.  Fifty-seven survivors were picked up.H.M. Canadian Destroyer Ottawa was sunk on the 14th by U-boat whileescorting a convoy 300 miles east of Newfoundland. Seventy-three survivors havebeen picked up.Northern Waters.10. A convoy to Russia of 41 ships (including one tanker and one rescueship), with a strong naval escort, was sighted by enemy aircraft on the 12th andshadowed continuously by aircraft and U-boats. Two ships were torpedoed and sunk by U-boats on the morning of the 13th, and- in the afternoon 37 torpedo bombers, in close formation, attacked the convoy and ten more ships were sunk.A further attack was made at dusk, but no ships were hit. One bomber was shot down. On the 14th the shadowing of the convoy continued, and about mid-day anattack by 22 torpedo bombers was successfully driven off and was followed by highbombing, which caused no damage. Fifteen enemy aircraft were destroyed andmany others probably damaged. Three Hurricanes from H.M. Auxiliary carrierAvenger were lost, but the pilots claim three enemy aircraft destroyed, fourprobably destroyed and 13 damaged. Up to 1700/17th no further attack on the convoy was reported.11. German heavy ships were sighted on the 10th off the Lofoten Islandsby our submarines on patrol. H.M. Submarine Tigris attacked without success.They were later reported in Alten Fjord.12. On the night of the 10th/11th 300 Russian Marines landed on the southside of the Motowski Gulf (west of Murmansk), destroying several guns andinflicting 160 casualties. Russian losses were less than 40. Enemy dive bombersbombed the area after the landing party had been withdrawn.Mediterranean.13. On the night of the 13th/14th a raid on Tobruk was carried outby destroyers, corvettes and M.T.B.S. of the Mediterranean Fleet and a smallmilitary force, supported by a considerable air attack. Some of our troops were&apos;successfully put ashore, penetrating the Tobruk perimeter and capturingsome gun positions. Heavy opposition was encountered by further landingparties. The subsequent withdrawal was not effected without losses. H.M.Destroyer Sikh, carrying troops, was hit by shore batteries and disabled before thetroops could be landed. HM. Destroyer Zulu attempted to take Sikh in tow but was also hit and forced to withdraw. Sikh is believed sunk. In the course ofthe withdrawal to Alexandria on the 14th our forces were subjected to incessantair attack. H.M. Cruiser Coventry (A/A ship) was bombed and set on fire,subsequently abandoned and sunk by Zulu. Later Zulu was bombed and holedand eventually sank after being in tow. Nine officers, 180 ratings and 60 royal marines were taken on board H.M. Destroyer Croome. Throughout the 14thlour M.T.B.S. and two M.L.S. were lost.14. H.M. Cruiser Dido and five destroyers bombarded the Daba area on - the same night, 350 rounds being fired. Naval aircraft provided theillumination.15. On the night of the 4th/5th the Greek submarine Papanicolisintercepted a small caique with an important allied prisoner on board in the Aegean.16. On the 10th HM. Submarine Una sank a 4,000-ton ship of the Rambclass, which was escorted by a destroyer and aircraft.H.M. Submarine P.42 shelled and obtained 12 hits on a river bridge west of Cape Spartivento (Southern Italy) on the 7th, and bombarded another bridgein the same area the following day,17. During the week 18,827 tons of French merchant shipping westboundand 24,678 tons eastbound passed Gibraltar under escort.[24366] &apos; b 2
Anti-Submarine Operations.18. A Sunderland from Gibraltar bombed and sank a U-boat on the 14th,when 80 miles north-east of Algiers. Thirty-six of the crew were seen in thewater after the sinking.Three surface and a large number of aircraft attacks were made in theWest Atlantic by United States and Canadian forces. Of these an attack byH.M. Canadian Corvette Clayoquot was promising.Two attacks were made by convoy escorts in mid-Atlantic and 14 attacks by aircraft are reported, three of which may have caused damage. Nine ofthese took place in. waters round the Shetlands, the Faroes and west of Rockall,two by Russian aircraft in the White Sea, one in the Bay of Biscay, one off cape St. Vincent and one in the Gulf of Aden.Enemy Intelligence.German.19. The pocket battleship Admiral Sdheer with the cruisers Hipper, Kolnand three destroyers have been located during the week in Altenfjord andneighbouring waters by air reconnaissance. It is thought that Tirpitz is stillin the Narvik area, but she has not been seen of late.The movement of troops and supplies from Oslo continues and these are probably bound for Esthonia, possibly in preparation for an attack on Leningrad.Two tankers, one of the Altmark class and one a former Norwegian shipcaptured in 1940, attempted to leave Biscay ports on the 10th and 11threspectively. They were, however, sighted and attacked by aircraft and are believed to have returned to port.Italian.20. Air reconnaissance of Messina on the 9th showed the presence of a new5 - 3-inch pruiser of the Regolo Class, and that the old cruiser A ttendolo, whichwas damaged on the 13th August, had left the port and has since been seen onthe 13th September at Naples.U-Boats.21.

The Japanese landed on Kuria Island (Gilbert Group) on the13th September.Protection of Seaborne Trade.23. During the week ending the 13th/14th, 1,120 ships have been convoyed.Of these 283 were in ocean convoys and 837 in British coastal convoys. Oneauxiliary aircraft carrier, one ocean boarding vessel, 50 destroyers (including three United States destroyers) and 101 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including three United States cutters) were employed on escort duties.During the week, 149 ships in three ocean convoys arrived in Home waters without loss.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 12th totalled 829,000 tons compared with 539,000 during the previous seven days, and an average of 672,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Of the week&apos;imports 307,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.During August, 2,382 ships have been convoyed in the Western Atlantic and caribbean; of these 18 have been lost by enemy action.Enemy Attacks on Seaborne Trade.24. Apart from those ships attacked in the convoy to Russia, 32 ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during the week, and of these 17 are known to have sunk.
Eleven ships were torpedoed in a determined attack by five or six U-boats onan outward-bound convoy to Canada; of these five are known to have sunk and four have reached port. Two ships were sunk and three others torpedoed in acoastal convoy in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and one ship was sunk off St.. John&apos;s.The s.s. Laconia (19,695 tons) with 700 service personnel on board was sunk300 miles N.E. of Ascension on the 12th, seven ships were sunk in the West indies and one ship in the Freetown area. One ship was damaged by explosion,cause unknown, in the commercial anchorage, Gibraltar.Four explosions, probably caused by torpedo attack, occurred in the anti-torpedo net at Barbados on the 11th, and one ship was hit by torpedo butremained afloat.British Minelaying.25. Mines have been laid by surface craft off the Dutch and French coastsand in Northern Waters. Aircraft laid mines off the German North Sea coast and in the Biscay area.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.26. During the week E-boats have laid mines in the Channel and off the norfolk coast. Sweeping has been carried out in Lyme Bay and off Yarmouth,where mines were laid last week.The mine totals are : 1,316 acoustic, 2,625 magnetic and 1,659 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.27. An express service, maintained by 18 ships totalling 31,825 tons, isoperating between Norwegian ports and Hamburg. The cargoes from Norwayconsist of fish, graphite, aluminium, carbide and ferro-silicon, and on the return journey from Hamburg brandy and tobacco are carried for the German garrisons in Norway.The German s.s. Leesee (2,624 tons) finished loading iron ore at Bilbao on the8th September and sailed three days later.Russian Intelligence.28. On the 10th the Russian Black Sea Fleet was taking part in theevacuation of the defenders of Novorossisk. On the 13th Russian shore-based aircraft claim to have sunk five mine-sweepers and a depot ship in Crimean ports.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Central Sectors.29. The Russians continue to exert pressure against the German positionssouth of Lake Ladoga and south-east of Leningrad. Their efforts in this area,however, remain on a small scale. They have renewed their attacks in strength in the Rzhev area, though still without achieving any substantial territorial gains.Don Sector:30. After some three weeks of suspended effort against the German bridge-head at Voronezh, the Russians have again made incursions into the Germanpositions there. They have been unable, however, to hold on to any of the groundso gained. Elsewhere, the Russians retain their footing on the southern bank ofthe Don near the latter&apos;s confluence with the River Khoper and in the areaKremenskaya-Novo Grigorevskaya.Stalingrad Sector.31. Having completed and narrowed their ring round Stalingrad on itsland side, the Germans have now begun their penetration into the city itself.The Russians, however, are still resisting most stubbornly and launchingcontinuous counter-attacks.Caucasus Sector.32. On the northern bank of the River Terek, eastwards of Mozdok, german forces which advanced to within 25 miles of Grozni have been thrown back by
Anti-Submarine Operations.18. A Sunderland from Gibraltar bombed and sank a U-boat on the 14th,when 80 miles north-east of Algiers. Thirty-six of the crew were seen in thewater after the sinking.Three surface and a large number of aircraft attacks were made in theWest Atlantic by United States and Canadian forces.

Having completed and narrowed their ring round Stalingrad on itsland side, the Germans have now begun their penetration into the city itself.The Russians, however, are still resisting most stubbornly and launchingcontinuous counter-attacks.Caucasus Sector.32. On the northern bank of the River Terek, eastwards of Mozdok, german forces which advanced to within 25 miles of Grozni have been thrown back by
Russian counter-attacks. The immediate threat to the latter town has thus beenstayed. At Mozdok and westwards, however, the Germans have crossed the Terekin force and have advanced some distance to the south. Whether their intention is to approach Grozni from the west or to continue the advance southward up theGeorgian Pass through the Caucasus range is not yet clear. In the western partof the Caucasus range German forces trying to infiltrate through the passestowards the Black Sea coast have made no further progress, but the capture by theGermans of the port of Novorossisk is confirmed.Summary.33. Now that the Germans have effected their first penetrations intoStalingrad, the possible early fall of the city has to be considered. With itscapture the Germans would be able to secure their territorial gains of the summerbehind the line Upper Don-Lower Volga. The defence of Stalingrad and itsapproaches has been going on for some six weeks. For the past week, every day that resistance has been prolonged has reduced the likelihood of a successfuloffensive. this year against the Russian armies of the Centre. Whether theGermans still feel that they have time enough for such an offensive is not known.In the last year&apos;s campaign the Germans continued to make progress until almost the end of November, although in the last half of that month the mud presentedan almost insurmountable difficulty. They may reckon, therefore, that they have before them some two to two and a half months of reasonable weather. a fortnight or so, however, will be needed for regrouping their forces and theremaining six to eight weeks give little, if any, margin for unexpected difficulties.Russian resistance is also proving stubborn on the line of the River Terek andon the Caucasus range. In the latter area snow will begin to impede operationstowards the end of October. Unless, therefore, the Germans can accelerate theirprogress over the mountains or succeed in by-passing them, they may well find themselves baulked this year of Southern Caucasia,Egypt.34. During the past week land operations in Egypt have been confined, on both sides, largely to patrol activities. Enemy infantry and working parties have been engaged on several occasions by our artillery.A raid on Tobruk on the night of the 13th/14th is described under naval situation, paragraph 13.Persia and Iraq.35. Headquarters, Persia and Iraq Command, opened in Baghdad onthe 15th.Far East.South-West Pacific.36. The four Australian battalions covering the gap in the Owen StanleyMountains were compelled to withdraw as the result of pressure and outflankingmovements by superior enemy forces estimated at 5,000. The Australian forces are now consolidating approximately 28 miles north-east of Port Moresby.The situation in the Milne Bay area is now quiet except for occasional patrolclashes with Japanese remnants.South Pacific.37.   A Japanese counter-attack against the U.S. positions in the South-EastSolomons has been in progress since the 12th.  No official details are available,available.AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. Dusseldorf, Bremen, Wilhelmshaven and Essen were heavily attackedat night by aircraft of Bomber Command.Enemy activity against this country was on a very small scale.Tobruk harbour was heavily bombed.
7269United Kingdom.39. Fighter Command flew 480 defensive sorties by day (including 12 by .S.A. aircraft) and 279 by night.Enemy activity against this country both by day and by night was on an extremely small scale. There was a diminution in the number of high-altitudereconnaissances, but one Ju. 86P was damaged by a Spitfire at 43.000 feet.Two enemy aircraft were destroyed and five damaged.Germany and Occupied Territory.I       Day.40. Aircraft of Fighter and Bomber Commands flew 391 and 32 offensive sorties respectively, compared with 1,196 and 22 last week. In addition, 37 sorties were flown by fighters of the U.S.A.A.F. About 17 tons of FEE. bombs were dropped.Five Mosquitos attacked a chemical factory at Wiesbaden; bombs were reported to have burst in the centre of the target. Other Mosquitos, operatingsingly, successfully bombed Wilhelmshaven. Kiel, Emden, Cuxhaven and Lubeck.Mustangs of Army Co-operation Command attacked railways and military targets near Rouen.During a sweep from Le Touquet to Dieppe by four squadrons of Spitfiresand two squadrons of U.S.A. Lightnings, four enemy fighters were damaged bySpitfires, one of which did not return.- Other sweeps were uneventful.The Photographic Reconnaissance Unit made 61 sorties, and a further 64photographic sorties were flown by aircraft of Army Co-operation Command.One Spitfire is missing.Night.41. Bomber Command despatched 1,493 aircraft against land targets,compared with 724 last week. About 1,165 tons of H.E. bombs (including sevenx 8,000 lbs. and 337 x 4,000 lbs.) and 1,720 tons of incendiaries (includingfour x 4,000 lbs.) were dropped during the week. Dusseldorf, Bremen and Essenreceived the main weight of attack. Wilhelmshaven was also raided on asubstantial scale.At Dusseldorf, 360 aircraft dropped 700 tons of bombs. Though a large part of the attacking force concentrated its effort on the main objective, startinga number of extensive fires (see Appendix VII). scattered fires were also seenwest of the target, and some bombs fell at Krefeld, Munchen-Gladbach and adjacent towns. Thirty bombers are missing, five crashed and three came downin the sea.An attack on Bremen was carried out in two phases by a total of 346aircraft; about 714 tons of bombs were dropped. The main force, despite badvisibility, successfully dropped bombs on the old town and dock district wherethe major areas of fire were concentrated. Twenty bombers are missing andthree crashed. /Wilhelshaven was the target for 202 bombers, all but three of whichreturned safely. About 383 tons of bombs were dropped by 179 aircraft inmoderate visibility. Many large fires were seen in the target area and someothers in its environs. Several crews reported a specially violent explosion inthe town and a large oil fire in the. dock area.A total of 477 tons of bombs was released during an attack on Essen by232 aircraft. Heavy ground haze obscured the target and many crews were unable to identify ground detail, but flares and incendiaries dropped by aPathfinder force were effective guides. Among the resultant fires was a largeblaze in the approximate position of Krupps&apos; works. Flak defences were3 exceptionally intense; of the 369 bombers despatched 39 did not return. two enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat.Twenty-four sorties were flown by &quot;Intruders&quot; over aerodromes in theLow Counties; one enemy aircraft was destroyed.Coastal Operations.42. Coastal Command despatched 676 sorties, of which 285 were on anti-U-boat operations and 45 on convoy escorts. Bomber Command despatched42 aircraft on patrols in the Bay of Biscay area (Results of anti-U-boatoperations are summarised under &quot; Naval Situation &quot;). Fighter Command flew614 shipping protection patrols.
Aircraft of Bomber Command, with ten squadrons of Spitfires and three off Typhoons as escort and diversion, attacked the Solglimt, a whale oil factoryship, at Cherbourg. Twelve Boston bombers attacked in two boxes. Bombs fromthe first wave hit railway sidings on the quayside. The second wave reportedhits on and around the ship; photographs confirm that the vessel was severely damaged.Attacks were made by Coastal Command aircraft on the dock area atCherbourg, a convoy off Texel and shipping off Holland and Spain; results werenot observed.   Fighter Command flew 70 uneventful sorties against shipping.Several combats with Ju. 88&apos;s took place during long-range routine patrols.One was destroyed and another damaged in the Bay of Biscay. Later in the week in the same area, a Wellington attacked by six of these aircraft, shot down one and damaged another; the remainder were probably damaged, and broke off their attck. Another enemy aircraft was shot down in the South-Western Approaches.Two aircraft of Coastal Command were lost.Aircraft of Bomber Command laid 98 sea-mines in enemy waters. Sea-mining was also successfully carried out by six Naval aircraft operating withCoastal Command.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.43. In the week ending 14th September 1,498 sorties were flown by allied aircraft,, compared with 3,374 in the previous week.Activity over the battle area was on a reduced scale, but our fighters main-tained strong offensive patrols and successfully attacked enemy formations. two large forces of heavily escorted dive bombers were broken up, six enemy aircraftshot down and 17 others probably destroyed or damaged, for no loss to ourselves.Another encounter took place between about 35 Kittyhawks and 50 enemy fighters,resulting in the destruction of four enemy aircraft; and a further four were probably- destroyed or damaged : Our loss was six Kittyhawks, but the pilot ofone is safe.Tactical reconnaissances were carried out over the battle area; these were generally flown by one Hurricane with an escort of approximately 30 fighters.A sustained night bombing effort was maintained against the harbour areaof Tobruk. Oh the. night of the 13th/14th, an exceptionally heavy attack was made in support of a combined naval and military operation. Thirty-five heavy bombers (including 21 U.S.A.A.C.) and 68 Wellingtons participated,and bombs landed on the jetties, on fuel tanks, on buildings in the town and among tents of a camp to the west of the town. At the same time Benghazi was attacked by 19 R.A.F. and U.S.A. Liberators, and the landing ground at SidiHaneish by 36 Bostons and U.S.A. Mitchells; four Wellingtons and four Mitchellsare missing. Patrols covering the Naval units engaged in the combined operationwere provided by long-range fighters; several formations of enemy aircraft were intercepted and forced to jettison their bombs and three enemy bombers were probably destroyed or damaged.A force of R.A.F. and U.S.A. Liberators carried out a daylight raid onBenghazi and made hits on two ships in the harbour, one of which was set on fire.Six Me. 109s made a low-flying attack on landing grounds between cairo and Fayoum and destroyed two &quot;bombers; damaged four other aircraft and shot down a training aircraft; one Me. 109 was destroyed and another probably destroyed by A.A. fire.Sea Communications.44. A Wellington torpedoed a vessel of 2,000 tons 50 miles north of Derna;the vessel caught fire and was later reported to be sinking.Crete.45. U.S.A, Liberators attacked Suda Bay, where fires were started in the docks. One ship was hit, and a possible hit made on another ship.Malta.46. Enemy operations against Malta were negligible. Formations of fighters flew towards the island, but on the approach of Spitfires they generally
avoided combat and withdrew. One Me. 109 was destroyed and one Spitfire is missing.Our fighters carried out offensive reconnaissances over Sicily, and one Spitfirefailed to return.Pacific Zone.47. In addition to continuous support to our ground forces in the Efogiarea, strong forces of Allied bombers attacked the enemy&apos;s aerodrome at Buna(New Guinea) on twro occasions. In the first attack, hits were made on the runway, dispersal bays and A.A. positions, and at least three aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Further hits on runways and dispersal areas weremade the next day and 17 aircraft on the ground were destroyed; large fires were started, fuel dumps destroyed and anti-aircraft guns silenced. Stores andbarges in the Buna district were bombed the following day. Attacks were alsocarried out against Lae and Vunakanau aerodromes and Rabaul Harbour, but owing to bad visibility results were unobserved. A destroyer, bombed offTrobriand Island, was subsequently reported to be stationary, on fire and down at the stern. Off Saumlakki (Tanimbar Island) an enemy vessel was hit and a cargo ship was probably sunk.No information of enemy activity has been received except that, on the10th, 60 Japanese fighter and 60 bomber sorties were flown a peak effort sincethe commencement of hostilities in this area.India and Burma.48. Allied aircraft bombed Myitkyina aerodrome and railway targets atMogaung and Mandalay. On the 14th an enemy bomber was reported over theHooghly River and another south of Chittagong.China.49.   No reports of Allied air activity have been received.On the 7th enemy aircraft, operating from Canton, were active over HunanProvince. Waves of eight to eleven fighters were repeatedly over the aerodromes at Hengyang, Lingling and Paoking. A few of these carried out machine-gunattacks, but little damage was caused.Aleutian Islands.50. On the 14th a considerable number of U.S.A. aircraft bombed enemy shipping and shore installations at Kiska. Two minesweepers were sunk, other vessels damaged and store houses and supply dumps set on fire.Russian Front.51. The Russians claim that in the week ending the 12th September theGermans lost 415 aircraft to 281 of their own.During the ten days from the 5th to 15th September the Germans claim tohave destroyed 1,215 Soviet aircraft, 936 of these in air combat. The Germansadmit the loss of 87 aircraft during the same period.Details of operations by the Soviet Air Force in the Stalingrad area havenot been received, but it appears that they may have been hampered by attacks on their aerodromes near the front.From the Caucasus area little information has been received. A successfulSoviet raid was made on a port in the Crimea where five minesweepers were sunk.Armavir was bombed and fairly heavy attacks were made on enemy ground unitssouth of Mozdok and in Novorossisk.In the extreme north the aerodromes of Luostari and Banak. were attacked on the 10th by heavy bombers. Six or more German aircraft were destroyed onthe ground and five Me. 109s were claimed to have been shot down in combat.Long range bombers attacked Budapest, Bucharest, Ploesti and Konigsberg.The moral effect of the raids on Hungary appears to have been considerable.The principal enemy effort continued to be directed against Stalingrad andwas mainly in support of the army. Attacks were also made against communica-tions, &amp;c, over a fairly wide area.In northern Norway a heavy scale of attack at a considerable range has been maintained against our Russian convoy both by long range bombers and torpedo-carrying aircraft (vide &quot; Naval Situation,&quot; para, 10).[24366] * c

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Germany.Dusseldorf.Assessment of damage from photographs taken the day after the attack onthe 10th/11th is rendered difficult as parts of the town are wholly obscuredby the smoke of fires still burning. It is at present only possible to give some idea of the extensive damage that has actually been caused. In the centre ofthe town there are six noteworthy areas of damage, the three largest of whichare f mile long, varying in- width from 90 yards to \ mile, ^ inile long by about180 yards wide, and nearly \ mile long and 250 yards wide. The damage to residential and industrial property on both banks of the Rhine is severe, andevacuation will be hindered by a direct hit on the main station, which appears tohave been heavily damaged.Karlsruhe.Photographs taken on the 9th and 11th confirm in detail the severity of the damage caused to the whole of the town and Rhine Harbour, in the attack on 2nd/3rd. At Griinwinkel and near the east end of the harbour 60 acres ofindustrial buildings and yards are devastated, while damage to residential and commercial property includes 280 acres of devastation. The main items of damage are given below: (a) Industrial.(i) In the town nine industrial concerns have been affected.    In HardtStrasse six buildings of a factory are almost completely destroyed, and near Steinhauser Strasse 14 sheds have been demolished, including one of 290 feet x 200 feet just west of the State Gas Works.(ii) In the Gninwinkel district there are nine acres of devastation to theJunker and Ruh A.G., including part destruction of the mainworkshop. In the Carl Metz factory (fire-fighting equipment) thereare 14 acres of destruction, and a small electro-motor factory inBenz Strasse is more than half destroyed.(iii) In the Muhlberg and Rheinhafen district a textile factory and a paintand dye works are both almost completely destroyed. The power station which supplies electricity to the suburbs has had the maingenerating house partially destroyed. A saw mill has been destroyedover an area of 14^ acres, and a briquette storage house was still on fire nine days after the raid.(b) Communications.In the railway repair shops south-east of the town a long shed and foursmaller sheds have been destroyed or damaged. On the west side of themain station a direct hit damaged a platform, railway tracks and somerolling-stock, and six other tracks were damaged at the West station at Griinwinkel.(c) General. &apos;(i) On the aerodrome one barrack block has been destroyed, another damaged and one of the hangars and a small shed have been demolished. Threebuildings of the Dragoon Barracks in Kaiser Allee have been destroyed or severely damaged,(ii) Eleven public buildings have been damaged, including the ExhibitionHall and the Court of Appeal. The largest area of residential damage is 70 acres, and probably includes the destruction of 11 blocks of flats.In other districts over 110 houses have been demolished.
Further information indicates that five days after the raid three-quarters ofthe town was still without electric current due to the damage to the electric power station. The Rhine Harbour was heavily damaged, many silos burnt out, andcranes destroyed. Five hundred trucks of coal on the harbour sidings were destroyed as well as 12 locomotives.&quot;Newspaper reports of the 3rd and 4th state that as a result of the attackthousands of people lost all their property within a few hours. There was evidence of panic on several occasions and a desire to leave the town.Saarlautern Area.Photographs taken on the 11th cover only a very small part ofSaarlautern and the nearby suburbs of Fraulautern. At Saarlautern twobuildings adjoining a sports ground, one 88 yards, the other 33 yards long, havebeen gutted and the north end of a building 85 yards long and two sheds havebeen destroyed. At Fraulautern four incidents of damage to industrial property and 63 incidents of damage to residential property are seen, in the latter casevarying from single houses to areas the largest of which are 3^ and two acres.Duisburg.Photographs -taken on the 10th show some, additional damage. InNeuendorf a large factory is almost entirely burnt out, and three or four morebuildings in the Vereinigte Stahlwerke are damaged. Damage to residential andpublic property is seen in several districts, particularly in Horsterbuch andPapendall, where the concert hall has been destroyed by fire.During the attack on 21st/22nd July the large French tug Nantes was sunk.Riisselsheim. -Photographs taken on the 11th cover only part of the Opel werkswhich produce armoured vehicles and components. An area of approximatelyeight acres next to the railway has been destroyed by fire, a four-bay buildingmeasuring 90 by 45 yards has been gutted, and several smaller buildings and stores of material have also been destroyed. A multibay factory building has been damaged by blast and eight or ten huts have been gutted. On the north edge ofthe area two sheds are partially destroyed, two large workshops are. damaged, andanother has had a direct hit, destroying part of the roof.Nuremberg.Photographs taken on the 11th cover that part of the centre of thecity missed in the previous. sortie. The further damage shown to residential property is considerable and fully explains the action of the Mayor in calling allmanagers of businesses connected with the building industry to conference. Theincidents of damage are numerous and the principal feature is an area of burnt-out houses extending over approximately ten acres to the east of the main railway station.Bischofsheim.Photographs taken on the 11th show that during the attack on 8th/9th fourtracks at the marshalling yard have been damaged, one building completely destroyed, and another damaged by blast.A ugsburg.Photographs taken on 11th September show that the 4,000-lb. bomb dropped on the night of 28th/29th August fell in a housing estate in the Oberhausendistrict. Two-thirds of a row of houses over 100 yards long was completelydemolished and other houses nearby suffered blast damage.Bremen.Photographs taken on the 10th of the Focke-Wulf Works show a direct hiton one of the hangars.Mainz.During the second raid on Mainz 24 barges laden with coal were sunk.
Occupied France.Meaulte.Photographs taken subsequent to the attack by U.S.A.A.F. Fortresses on the6th show that damage caused by the 18 or more bursts plotted among the factorybuildings on photographs taken at the time of the attack includes. (a) A direct hit in the centre of a 10-bay hangar, resulting in a large hole inthe roof covering two of the bays.(b) A direct hit at the east end of the wire drawing shop.(c) A further direct hit on some camouflaged hangars on the west side of the landing ground.(d) Roof damage throughout the entire length of the two main assemblyshops.(e) Two or three bays at the south end of the garage S.A.M. which have suffered from the blast of a near miss.(/) An additional 12 craters on the landing area.Havre.Photographs taken during the attack on the 8th show that two bombs have hit two &quot;M&quot; class mine-sweepers moored alongside each other. Onebomb is seen bursting on the starboard side and port side respectively of the twovessels, just aft of the superstructure, and the second bomb is seen bursting onthe inner of the two vessels between the funnel and the bridge. In addition, onebomb has fallen on the roof of a large warehouse on the North Quay of the Bassinde la Maree, and three more on the North and South Quays of the Petrol Basin.Occupied Belgium.Ostend.Photographs taken on the 6th September show that, during the attack onthe 29th August, a long 3-bay building near the Bassin de la Marine was com-pletely wrecked, and two bays of another 6-bay building demolished.Occupied Holland.Sluyskil.Photographs taken on the 13th September show that, as a result of attacks on the 22nd and 25th July, and on the 27th August, the Compagnie Neerlandaisede 1&apos;Azote (chemical works) has been damaged.In the Ammonia Synthesis building the roof of the central bay has beenstripped over, an area of about 185 by 55 feet, and the roof of the northern bayis damaged by blast. In the Sulphuric Acid Plant two bays at the S.E. cornerhave been damaged, the roof of one having been strioped over an area of80 by 25 feet.Sea-Mining.It is reported that the German cargo ship Hamburg of 5,000-6,000 tons, was recently in dock at Copenhagen being repaired after hitting a magnetic mine.The Swedish Wireless has announced that the Swedish steamer Tynningoeof 4,272 tons was mined on the 7th /8th September off the German North SeaCoast.   The whole of her crew was saved.General.The following accounts of air-raid damage to Bremen caused during the attacks at the end of June have been received : (i) &quot;After three dreadful night attacks I went to Margofs at Berlin.At one time five high-explosive bombs burst with full, force in the street; and then, three more fell very near. Our apartment is minusthe window-panes, and the dust and dirt were so hopeless that I left with a heavy heart.&apos;&apos; The attacks are ghastly and our poor Bremen is like a ruin.&quot; To-day, another attack has been announced. . . .   The worryover whether one can retain one&apos;s goods and chattels, through thismurderous destruction, is nerve-racking. ...&quot;
(ii) &quot; I talked with citizens of Bremen who wept with rage and despairwhile describing the ruins and the bombings to me . . . true, thenumber of victims does not seem great in consideration of the violenceof the attack and the number of destroyed houses, nor do the ruinsapproach those of lubeck  and Cologne in dismal horror, but, none the less, the psychological effect seemed equally great. Between4,000 and 5,000 houses were destroyed, which is about 10 per cent, ofthe houses of Bremen. The most vital industry struck was theFocke-Wulf Works. In the neighbouring city of Delmenhorsttwo-thirds of the industries were destroyed, including in part theworld-famous linoleum factory and large parts of the wool factories.An army of 2,000 window-makers were rushed to Bremen to put inthe window-panes blown out by the tail wind of the R.A.F. 5 million marks&apos; worth of panes were broken.&quot;The following circular has been issued by the Germans : Protection of Inland Shipping against Air-raid Danger.It has been found that during various air-raids incendiary bombs have caused ships to sink by piercing clean through the ship&apos;s bottom. As from now every ship must carry in readiness a number of wooden plugs of varioussize, in order to repair any such damage by bombs by plugging the holesimmediately. Ten wooden plugs, round in shape, slightly pointed at one end,about 30 cm. long and 7-10 cm. diameter, must be made and these are kept invarious parts of the ship for immediate use as described above.These round plugs are to be made out of old wood which may be available on board. If suitable wood is not available, the necessary wood may beobtained against receipt.
