ON the 6th August the Committee of Ministers, appointed by the WarCabinet at its meeting on the 1st August * approved the Admiralty proposal thatnine intermediate aircraft-carriers should be laid down in addition to the fourapproved in the last programme; also that the corvette programme should be varied.t This scheme had been expected to involve cancellation of four cruisers,a minesweeper and two cargo liners, also delay to four other cruisers, six destroyers, some sweepers and about twelve merchant vessels; in addition, it was proposed to cancel four twin-screw corvettes and to substitute seven single-screw type.2. 1 agreed with the proposal to build nine additional intermediate carriers,but doubted whether the cancellation of the four cruisers and the delay in otherconstruction work should be accepted. The proportion of the national war effortdevoted to shipbuilding was, in my view, too small. The Committee of Ministersaccordingly invited me, in consultation with the First Lord, to consider thepossibility of continuing the cruiser programme (or, alternatively, increasingstill further the carrier programme) concurrently with the additions to the 1942programme then approved.3. The Admiralty have considered the possibilities. The Board point outthat at the end of 1945 they estimate that the carrier strength of the Navy willbe 47 per cent, short of requirements, as calculated by present standards, whereascruisers will be 29 per cent, under strength. They take the view that, instead of replacing all four cancelled cruisers in the programme, any additional capacity which can be made available will be employed more profitably in the constructionof intermediate carriers than in building cruisers; they, therefore, do not proposeto reinstate the four cruisers but to add three intermediate carriers (the limit o&amp;&apos;*the slips available) and i-einstate one cruiser in the approved 1942 programme.4. Capacity for these additional ships can be found at Messrs. Harland andWolffs works at Belfast (two additional carriers), at His Majesty&apos;s Dockyard.Devonport (one carrier) and His Majesty&apos;s Dockyard, Portsmouth (one cruiser).&apos;The building of large ships in the Royal Dockyards is a departure from the policyfollowed since the fall of France, but the Board of Admiralty consider that therisk can be taken in view of the increased strength of our.air defences.5.   The proposals are set out in greater detail in a memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty, which is attached as Appendix I.6. The additional intermediate carriers, tdgether with the two alreadyincluded in Messrs. Harland and Wolffs programme will involve a reduction in* W.M.

Total..........8,50010. The quantity of extra steel involved in the proposed additions to theprogramme will not be substantial.11. Aircraft for the additional intermediate carriers in the 1942programme have hot been considered by the Ministers who examined the problemof aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm in 1943, since the earliest of these ships willnot be delivered until 1944, but though there is a shortage of aircraft in mid-1943, present plans show a surplus over requirements at the end of thatyear, this having been in part achieved by the Admiralty accepting, for thetime being, a reserve of 50 per cent, for the supernumerary squadrons insteadof the 190 per cent, originally asked for.12. As regards the labour position, it will be seen from the Admiraltynote* that even allowing for an improvement in the output of the presentworkpeople the new commitments involve substantial additional numbers. Themeasures lately taken to procure additional skilled labour are for various reasonsbringing results slowly. If essential progress is to be made on the navalprogrammes, the labour position must continue to receive urgent attention;otherwise the priority recently accorded to naval and mercantile production will only have limited success.13. In considering the proposals vis-a-vis the programmes of the united nations it may be suggested that these long-term commitments for naval vesselsat the expense of merchant tonnage are inconsistent with the policy of theUnited States in concentrating on short-term production. This, however, isnot the case having regard to the differing strategic and operational requirements and the relatively favourable position of the United States in the heavier types of warships and their merchant tonnage output.14. I accordingly recommend that the Admiralty proposals as now presentedbe approved, that the Admiralty be invited to press on with their action forsecuring the most efficient use of labour, and that the Minister of Labour beinvited to give urgent attention to the consequential labour demands.* Appendix II.Ministry of Production,Great George Street, S.W. 1,September 15, 1942.this firm&apos;s output, of merchant ships of about 48,000 tons a year, consisting offive high-class cargo liners, either insulated or suitable for insulation. They may also slow down a little from one a month to one every six weeks the rate of delivery of fleet minesweepers by this firm. The carrier at Devonport and the cruiser at Portsmouth will involve displacement of two Black Swan sloops at each yard.7. Plans are under consideration for making good or minimising these losses but this will depend entirely on an improvement in the labour situation,and on successful results from efforts now in train to improve labour efficiency.In any case, while it might be possible to make good the loss of merchant, ships in actual tonnage, the Admiralty do not think that it can be clone in the formof insulated ships.8. The Admiralty&apos;s labour requirements are set down in Appendix II.Existing shipbuilding commitments involve an increase during 1942 of 19,000in the total labour force this figure including the comb-out from other industries of the additional 2.700 skilled men, approved by the Cabinet in May. and thetraining as welders of 300 unskilled persons monthly from now on. There isbelieved to be a reasonable prospect that this programme will be achieved, thoughthe rate of placing of the skilled labour has so far been disappointingly slow.9.   The following further labour will be needed in 1943 : To replace 1,800 skilled men likely to be withdrawn for entry into the Royal Navy for service in repair depots abroad ... 2.100Number needed to replace the loss of merchant tonnage and four displaced sloops ...       ...     ....       ...       ...       ... 4,400Additional workers in marine engineering due to naval con-struction requiring higher engine power than merchanttonnage............      ............. 2,000
Further Additions to New Construction Programme, 1942.AT a meeting held on the Gth August (MISC. 33 (42) 1st Meeting) it was approved to add nine intermediate aircraft carriers to the 1942 New construction programme.2. At the same time it was proposed that consideration should be given tothe possibility of proceeding with the four cruisers which it had been intendedto cancel in order to provide capacity for some of the nine additional aircraft carriers; or alternatively, that consideration should be given to the possibilityof still further increasing the carrier programme.3. By the end of 1945, when the last of the nine intermediate carriers is completed, it is estimated, after allowing for casualties and obsolescence, thatwith the present approved programme the carrier strength of the Royal Navy willbe 47 per cent, short of requirements, as calculated by present standards, with three Ark Royals to complete during the following year; cruisers at that date willbe 29 per cent, under strength, with two or three Fiji Class still under construction.4. In the circumstances it is considered that any additional capacity whichcan be made available will be more profitably employed in the construction of intermediate aircraft carriers, rather than cruisers.5. It has been found possible to undertake two further intermediatecarriers at Messrs. Harland and Wolffs works at Belfast for completion in thesecond half of 1945. This firm have already been allocated two of the thirteenintermediate carriers so far approved, as well as one armoured fleet carrier ofthe 1942 programme. The construction of a total of four intermediate carriersby this firm will involve a reduction in, their merchant ship output of about48,000 tons in each of the years 1943, 1944 and 1945. and this in effect means theloss in each year of five high-class cargo liners, either insulated or suitable forinsulation. These we cannot replace from any other establishment available for merchant shipbuilding, however successful we may be in replacing this tonnage by obtaining additional labour to work in existing or additional merchant ship-yards. In addition, to construct these carriers wall probably reduce the rate ofproduction of fleet minesweepers by Messrs. Harland and Wolff to one every six weeks, instead of one a month.6. Since the fall of France it has been our policy not to undertake thebuilding or the repair of large ships in the Royal Dockyards owing to the dangerof air attack. In view of the increase in the strength of air defence I considerthat this policy can be revised to a limited extent, and I propose to undertake the building of an intermediate carrier at Devonport, to be laid down early in1943 and to complete 27 months later.7. It is not practicable to lay down an intermediate carrier at Portsmouthat present owing to the time which would be necessary to alter the slip to takea vessel of this type. It is, however, possible to lay down a cruiser at this yardearly next year for completion about the end of 1945, and I propose to proceed accordingly.8. The construction of the aircraft carrier at Devonport and of the cruiserat Portsmouth will involve the displacement of four &quot; Black Swan &quot; sloops, twoat each of these yards, which it was intended to lay down at the beginning of1943.9. My proposals are, therefore, to add three further intermediate aircraft carriers to the 1942 Programme, and to cancel three of the cruisers of this programme instead of four as formerly proposed. If this is approved, theshortage of aircraft carriers strength, at the end of 1945, will be reduced to37 per cent., and the shortage of cruiser strength to 27 per cent.Admiralty, September 14, 1942.
THE labour force employed in the private shipbuilding and ship-repairingfirms stands at 224,500 (June 1942) compared with 117,800 immediately beforethe war. The increasing demands for new construction and repairs have been met in a variety of ways, e.cj., entry of skilled men, dilution and up-grading,coupled with the entry of unskilled labour, training, increase in apprentices and(to a more limited extent) the employment of women.In 1941, through the medium of. the Industrial Registration (No. 1) Order,some 13,500 skilled men, who had previously been employed in the industry, werereabsorbed into the shipyards. Of the men so registered very appreciable numberswere not available for transfer because they were holding key positions in other essential war work. Steps are now being taken to make 2,700 more ofthese skilled men available for the shipyards, though the task is provingdifficult, and for a variety of i-easons progress is slow. The advent of theseskilled men is intended to give scope for. further measures of up-grading anddilution and the entry of more unskilled labour, but the acute shortage in certainoccupations, &amp;c, riveters, welders, coppersmiths, &amp;c, will need to be remediedif a balanced labour force is to be secured. Training facilities exist for riveters,welders, fitters and electricians. The need for increasing these facilities hasbeen impressed on the industry, and the means of doing so is under discussion between the Admiralty, Ministry of Labour, and representatives of the industry.In the particular case of welders, arrangements have been made for an additional labour force of 3,250 to be trained by June 1943, at a rate of approximately 300a month. The industry is also being pressed to increase the employment ofwomen labour, and although the number employed is low, progress is now beingmade.To meet existing commitments&apos; an increase of 19,000 in the total labour force(including the 2,700 skilled men mentioned above) is being aimed at during 1942and there seem to be reasonable prospects of this target being achieved. Theoutput of merchant tonnage in several yards could be increased, with a furthersupply of labour. In particular, this is the case at certain yards on the Clyde.This matter is receiving attention.Account must be taken of the fact that at least 1.800 skilled men are likelyto be withdrawn from the industry for entry into the Royal Navy for service inrepair depots abroad. As their replacement will largely have to be made by up-grading, dilution. &amp;c, at least 2,100 men will be needed.If the further requirements (i.e., to replace the merchant tonnage plus thefour &quot; Black Swans&apos;-) are to be met, it is estimated that an additional balancedlabour force of the order of 4.400 will be needed. Recruitment of skilled men willbe difficult as it means a further comb out from the essential war industries.There is, however, scope for further dilution and interchangeability which to someextent would ease the problem. Allowance must be made for the fact that thenaval construction will involve more engine power than the merchant ship tonnageit replaces. There has not been time to assess this accurately, but an allowance of2,000 men is suggested tentatively.To sum up, if the merchant shipbuilding output is not to suffer any lossthrough the decision to increase the naval programme, provision must be made forthe recruitment of some 8,500 men, in addition to the balance of present pro-gramme of increasing the numbers employed in the industry.We have probably reached the stage at which it is impracticable to get ship-yard skilled men in large numbers, but if the Admiralty could be given 8,500 able-bodied men, capable of heavy work, in the yards in which it is required, and theMinistry of Labour will assist in pressing both sides of the industry to take,train and use this untrained labour, it should be possible to maintain the merchantship building programme.Admiralty, September 14, 1942.
