With reference to the further Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the 17th August(W.P.(42)364), I have had an opportunity of examining thecollection of diplomatic documents which have been prepared.2. While I appreciate the motives of the foreign secretary in again pressing for publication, I am bound tosay that I think there is, as the Prime Minister suggestedwhen the matter was before the Cabinet on 1st december last, a considerable likelihood that &quot;while few people would read a long publication of this kind, there was a risk that particular documents or passages would be tornfrom their contexts and used to rake up past incidents&quot;.3. I have particularly in mind the documents relatingto Munich, such as those giving an account of Sir HoraceWilson&apos;s interviews with Hitler which were evidentlydrafted without the matter of publication being in mind.I should think these would be widely quoted and thus most likely to revive this controversy.4. I cannot believe that there is much doubt anywhere asto who brought about the war.     Where it does exist I doubtif publication of these documents would bring about achange of mind.      If, however, propaganda against our casewere to develop either in America or in the Soviet Union -particularly in relation to &quot;post-war policy in regard toGermany&quot; - the matter could then be considered again.K.W.Treasury,    S.W.I.24th August,  1942,
