(42) 411.September 15, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KE1YIt is requested that special care may be tak\m toensure the secrecy of this document   &apos;WAR CABINET.NAVAL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT their meeting on the 1st August. 1942,*- the War Cabinet consideredcertain proposals by the First Lord of the Admiralty for modification in theprogramme of Naval Construction which had been approved by the War Cabinetin the previous April, t   The main points were as follows : (a) That nine intermediate aircraft-carriers should be laid down in additionto the four approved in the last new construction programme. Thiswould involve the cancellation of four cruisers, a mine-sweeper andtwo cargo liners and delay to four other cruisers, six destroyers, somemine-sweepers and about twelve merchant vessels.(b) It was also proposed to cancel four twin7screw corvettes and to replace them by seven single-screw corvettes.(c) The First Lord of the Admiralty was asked by the Prime Minister toconsider going further and cancelling the laying down of the verylarge type of destroyers in order to release capacity to build morespeedily a larger number of smaller destroyers.2. The War Cabinet remitted these questions for investigation by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the Foreign Secretary and the Ministerof Production in conjunction with the Board of Admiralty. In the absence ofthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, I now report as follows : 3. On the 6th August a meeting was held under my Chairmanship.^ TheSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs was unfortunately unable to be present.This meeting (i) Approved the Admiralty proposals (a) to add to the 1942 programme nine intermediate carriers, it being-understood that this addition to the programme would not bemade at the expense of the provision of aircraft for the RoyalAir Force;(b) to add to the 1942 programme seven single-screw corvettes andto cancel four twin-screw corvettes.(ii) Invited the Minister of Production, in consultation- with the First.Lord of the Admiralty, to consider the possibilities of continuing thefull cruiser programme (or,&apos; alternatively, of increasing still further the carrier programme) concurrently with the additions to the 1942programme authorised in (i) (a).* W.M. (42) 101st Conclusions, Mirmte 4.t W.M. (42) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 4.$ MISC. 33 (42) 1st Meeting.[24354]
(iii) Invited the Minister of Production.- in consultation with the FirstLord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Aircraft Production, to examine the memorandum onFighter Requirements for the Fleet Air Arm which had been preparedby the Chief of Naval Air Services and the Air Member for Supplyand Organisation for submission to the Defence Committee (Supply).This examination should aim at reducing&apos; the Fleet Air Arm reserves to an agreed minimum, clue consideration being given to the assump-tion that we must expect to sustain some carrier losses in future.4. Conclusion (i) is now reported to the War Cabinet for formal confirmation -mation.5. In pursuance of Conclusion (ii). the Minister of Production and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty have considered the possibility of continuing thefull cruiser programme (or, alternatively, of increasing still further the carrierprogramme) concurrently with the additions to the 1942 programme authorised in Conclusion (i).Their Report, with which I agree, is for convenience circulatedseparately as W.P. (42) 412. The proposals . in that Paver are notesubmitted for approval by the War Cabinet.6. Conclusion (iii). which deals with fighter requirements of the Fleet air arm, has also been further examined by the Minister of Production, First Lordof the Admiralty. Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of aircraft production.The Conclusions arrived at, with which I agree, are for convenience setout in W.P. (42) 413, and are also submitted for crpproval by the WarCabinet.7. As regards the proposed substitution&apos; of smaller destroyers for large-type destroyers (see paragraph 1 (c) above), the First Lord is dealing with thismatter in correspondence direct with the Prime Minister, and in the circum-stances I have thought it unnecessary to deal with this point, specifically in this paper.A.
