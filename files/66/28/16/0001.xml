SiPHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)*S E C R E ToW.P.(42)  586o28th AUGUST. 1943, COPY NO,.WAR CABINETLEND-LEASE OPERATIONSMemorandum by the Chancellor or the Exchequer.1. The Foreign Secretary (in W.P.(42)380) rightly  .emphasises the importance and significance of the statements of the President of the United States.2. The matter was dealt with at length by Lord Simon,speaking on behalf of the Treasury in the House of Lords onthe 22nd July last - the first convenient opportunity afterthe issue of the President&apos;s Report - on the occasion of a debate on financial issues.     Lord Simonfs statement receivedwide publicity and was the subject of leading articles in thePress, which&apos;commented on it in favourable terms.     Lord Simongave a number of quotations both from the Atlantic charter and from the Report referred to in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper.     He described President Roosevelt&apos;s declaration as&quot;one of the most striking events in the economic discussionof international problems arising out of the war&quot;;    he said,that it was &quot;a generous declaration11 and that it formed &quot;a firm and broad basis for co-operation with the United states in winning the Peace.&quot;3. To complete the present picture we have also to bearin mind first that in fact we have, at considerable sacrifice,paid for a very large proportion of arms and other commoditites-itios which we have received from the United States, amountingto some  1,000 millions;     secondly, that we are about to exchange notes (probably on Thursday 3rd September) setting out the basis on which we in our turn furnish aid to theUnited   States.     This, in fact, confirms the arrangements which have already been in practical operation for some timeunder which we have provided free of charge supplies and services for the United States forces both in the UnitedKingdom and in the Colonial Empire.     A similar exchange of notes with the United States   Government will be signed by^the Governments of Australia and New Zealand.     Pull publicitywill be given to those arrangements on September 3rd, and I hopoalso to refer to the matter in more detail when financial matters are under discussion in the House of Commons at thenext sitting of Parliament.K.W..Treasury Chambers, S.Wd.28th August, 1942*
