NAVAL   SITUATION.General Review.1.   One U-boat has been sunk and several damaged.Japanese U-boat activity has been extended to the Gulf of Aden.Shipping losses, principally due to U-boat attacks in Canadian waters, havebeen lighter than of late.Home Waters.2. Enemy coastal batteries shelled Dover on the evening of the 4th and damaged some light craft in the harbour.During the night of the 7th/8th the s.s. Solglimt (12,246 tons, whale oilfactory ship) and anothei&apos; ship, both heavily escorted, were attacked in theChannel by our light forces. In both attacks the escorts were damaged by gun-fire, but no torpedo hits were claimed on the merchant ships. One M.T.B. andone M.G.B. were slightly damaged. Subsequently the Solglimt was sighted inCherbourg.Mediterranean.3. On the 7th H.M. Submarine P. 34 torpedoed a 9,000-ton ship in a south-bound convoy to the south-west of Greece. Further air attacks were made on thisconvoy, as reported under Air Situation.Three Italian destroyers have been damaged by our aircraft during the week.In the past week seven enemy ships bound for Libya have been sunk or damaged by our aircraft and submarines.Naval aircraft in co-operation with the R.A.F. have continued their nightlybombing raids on enemy forces in the battle area.During the week 21,350 tons of French merchant shipping westbound and16,396 tons eastbound have passed Gibraltar under escort.Anti-Submarine Operations.4. On the night of the 3rd/4th H.M. Destroyers Pathfinder, Vimy andQuentin sank a U-boat, believed to be V. 464, south of Barbados. Forty-nineprisoners were captured.   Vimy was damaged in ramming the U-boat.Other attacks have been made by convoy escorts to the west of Ireland (R)and east of the Azores. Seven promising attacks, which may have causeddamage, were carried out by aircraft in the Bay of Biscay. On the 3rd a damagedItalian U-boat entered Santander. *Twelve surface and eight aircraft attacks have been carried out by U.S.A.forces in the West Atlantic. One aircraft attack may have damaged a U-boat inthe Belle Isle Straits.Enemy Intelligence.Italian.5. The battleship Littorio has left dry dock and is now presumed to be effective.Japanese.6. The main Japanese forces are believed to be concentrated in the MandatedIslands, with an advanced fuelling base for cruisers and destroyers in theBougainville Strait.The Japanese are now in possession of all the northern islands of the Gilbertgroup.U-boats.7. There are over 80 U-boats operating in the Atlantic, and about 20 avail-able for operations in Northern Waters. Activity is reported in the Gulf of St.Lawrence and in the Caribbean.   Six U-boats are operating off the Gold Coast,
and Japanese U-boats have been reported in the Gulf of Aden and oft&apos; the east coast of Ceylon.A new type of German U-boat is now in commission, which may be employed for supplying other U-boats.Protection of Seaborne Trade.8. During the week ending 6th/7th September 939 ships have been convoyed.Of these, 219 were in ocean convoys and 720 in British coastal convoys. Oneauxiliary aircraft carrier, one ocean boarding vessel, 57 destroyers (including two.S.A. destroyers) and 93 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including three U.S.A.cutters) were employed on escort duty.During the week 141 ships in four ocean convoys arrived in Home Waters,with the loss of four ships.9. During August 367 ships in 14 convoys arrived in the United kingdom without loss, and three homeward-bound convoys, consisting of 107 ships, lost16 ships and one straggler by enemy action. Six ships and one straggler were lost in outward-bound convoys. In addition, two homeward-bound convoys whichwere at sea on 31st August had lost four shijjs by that date.10. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending 5th September totalled 539,000 tons, compared with 670.000 tons duringthe previous seven days; and an average of 635.000 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports, 143,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. Ten ships and three small vessels are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during the week; eight ships and three small vessels are known tohave sunk. Four ships in a Canadian coastal convoy were sunk in the Gulf of st. Lawrence. Two ships were sunk in the Wabana Anchorage, Newfoundland,one ship was torpedoed in the Straits of Belle Isle and a tanker was sunk in theGulf of Mexico. One ship was sunk some 450 miles south-west of Takoradi, andanother was unsuccessfully attacked east of Aden. Three small ships were sunkin the Eastern Mediterranean.A British supply ship was sunk by two Japanese cruisers in Milne Bay, new guinea.A motor fishing vessel was mined and sunk off the East Coast.12. Shipping losses from enemy action during August 1942. as recordedto date, total 603,000 tons as compared with the monthly totals of 590.000 for July,783,000 for June. 708,000 for May and 623,000 for April.&quot; The August figure includes 98,000 tons lost in the Mediterranean Convoy to Malta. The losses inAugust were almost entirely due to U-boat attack, only 75,000 tons having been lost by aircraft and 8,000 tons by surface craft. The total of 520,000 tons sunk by U-boats compares with 410.000 tons in July and 684.000 cons in June. the downward tendency apparent in July has not been maintained, and an analysis ofthe monthly losses due to U-boats, divided into 10 day periods, shows a slightupward tendency.Ist-lOth August 162.000 tons.llth-20th August 170,000 tons.21st-31st August 188,000 tons.The bulk of the losses has occurred in the Atlantic : 219,000 tons being sunkin the West Atlantic, 112,000 tons in the Freetown and Azores areas, and 138,000tons in the North-West and South-West Approaches. The losses of tankers,141,000 tons in August, although greater than in July (97,000 tons) show animprovement on June (196,000 tons) and the previous three months.British Minelaying.13. Mines have been laid by surface craft off the Flemish coast, and mine-laying by our aircraft has taken place off the German North Sea coast and in the bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.14. During the week E-boats have laid mines on the East Coast and ,inLyme Bay. Minelaying by aircraft was reported on one night in the thames estuary.[24338] b
MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this Resume as aninset.)The Russo-German Campaign.Northern Sector.18. The Russians continue to make local attacks in the Leningrad area andsouth of Lake Ladoga.Central Sector.19. Russian attacks, which have been in progress unceasingly for the greaterpart of a month, though without achieving any substantial territorial result, havesomewhat abated.Upper Don and Stalingrad Sectors.20. The Russians have established, and slightly extended, a bridgehead onthe southern bank of the Don at the latter&apos;s confluence with the River Khoper.They also retain their footing in the north-east corner of the Don bend, fartherto the east.21. German forces attacking Stalingrad from the north-west and the south-west have closed in and now almost ring the city west of the Volga at a distance of some eight miles from its centre. An assault, on the city proper may havealready begun, but fierce Russian resistance still continues, and there is no indication as to how long the Russians can continue to hold it.Caucasus Sector.22. German detachments, pushing forward from the Elista area, are approaching the Volga north-west of Astrakhan and the railway Astrakhan-Kizlyar, south-west of Astrakhan. It is to be expected that the railway will soon be cut. In the advance towards Grozni the Germans have established bridgeheadssouth of the River Terek, eastwards of Mozdok and at Mozdok itself. They have extended that at Mozdok, despite Russian resistance, and the advance towardsGrozni may be resumed shortly. In the western part of the Caucasian rangeGerman forces trying to infiltrate through the passes are being held, though atone point they are less than 30 miles from Sukhumi. The Germans have made no further progress towards Tuapse.   But farther westwards, Novorossisk hasThirty-eight mines have been destroyed in the minefield to the east ofLowestoft. which has now been cleared.The mine totals are : 1.316 acoustic, 2.619 magnetic and 1,629 moored.15. Archangel and Molotovsk Were re-opened on the 1st September, butmoored mines are suspected in the approaches to the White Sea. The Italiansare reported, to have reinforced their minefield off Kalibia on the coast of Tunis.Enemy Merchant Shipping.16. The German s.s. Elizabeth Hendrik Fisser (5,145 tons), on passage fromValencia to Genoa, is reported to have run aground off Cape Oropesa onthe 29th August.The Italian tankers Albaro (2,104 tons) and Celeno (3.740 tons) left Istanbulfor Constanza on the 7th.It has been confirmed that the Japanese s.s. Brazil Maru (5,860 tons) was sunk by a U.S.A. submarine off Truk on the 7th August.Russian Intelligence.17. On the 2nd two Russian gunboats (converted Don River steamers) wereblown up by their crews, as they were unable to break out of the Sea of Azov.On the 4th two Soviet destroyers shelled .enemy positions- north of Novorossisk.
been claimed by the Germans; they have taken Anapa, and, as the result of anattack across the Kerch Straits, the whole of the Tainan Peninsula is now in their hands.Summary.23. There is no evidence whether or not the Russian attacks in the northern and Central sectors have had any appreciable effect in diverting German forces from the south. The attacks appear to have been in the nature of harassingoperations rather than of a grand offensive. The Russians have had some success in their establishment of a bridgehead at the junction of the Don and the Khoper.It is doubtful, however, whether they can exploit their achievement sufficientlyrapidly or sufficiently extensively to influence the issue at Stalingrad.Egypt.(An outline map of the area of the recent fighting is included in this resume as an inset.)24. During the night of the 2/3rd we attacked enemy laagers in the areasSamaket Gaballa and Deir el Ragil. The following day our air reconnaissancereported a general movement westwards in three main columns in the enemyback areas. Enemy forces also withdrew slightly in the forward area, harassedon all sides by our mobile units. At last light, the main enemy mechanical trans-port concentration was in the area south of Deir el Munassib; There were artilleryexchanges in the southern sector, where our forces in an attack southwards made an advance of approximately four miles during the night of the 3/4th.25. On the 4th, four enemy counter-attacks, including two supported bytanks, were repulsed by our troops. The enemy continued his withdrawalharassed all the time by our artillery, armoured forces and the R.A.E. Anattempt by a small party of Italian Marines to land behind our lines and sabotagethe railway met with little success, the entire party being captured.26. The enemy withdrawal continued on the 5th. By the end of the day,the bulk of his forces had withdrawn west of the minefields and held the general line Deir el Munassib-Qarat el Himeimat. The enemy withdrew slightly thefollowing day and by last night the bulk of his forces had retired to the positionswhich they held prior to the battle. A triangular area six miles by twelve tothe east of the minefields was still in enemy hands. Our light columns which attacked this area on three sides encountered considerable opposition.27. During these operations the enemy has suffered considerable losses intanks and mechanical transport vehicles. These losses were clue to the supportgiven to our forward troops by our artillery and also by the Royal Air Force.28.. During the rest of the period there has been some activity behind theenemy front in the Southern sector. His forces have established strong pointsnorth and east of Deir el Munassib in order to deny us observation of that area.Our patrols report small numbers of tanks at several points behind the enemy positions north of Qarat el Himeimat.Far East.South West Pacific.29. In New Guinea, in the Kokoda area, the enemy have penetrated southof Owen Stanley Mountains and have occupied a point seven miles south of the range. Our mopping-up operations in Milne Bay are reported to be nearlycomplete. The Japanese force which made the original landing has been identified as a naval landing party. Elsewhere, the enemy are reported to beimproving communications and moving inland.30. The Australian forces in the New Guinea area have been reinforced bya Corps Headquarters and a Division.  -China.31. The Japanese withdrawal to the east along the Chekiang-Kiangsi rail-way has apparently halted west of Kinhwa. It is unlikely that a furtherwithdrawal will take place.[24338] b 2
AIR SITUATION.General Review.32.   Bomber Command aircraft attacked Bremen, Duisburg and Frankfurt.In Egypt, our air forces co-operated fully with our land forces.Successful attacks again were made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.United Kingdom.33. Fighter Command flew 770 defensive sorties by clay (including 94 byUS.A. aircraft) and 475 by night.Forty-three enemy aircraft flew over this country by day and 58 by night.Eight were destroyed (including two Me. 210s shot down by Typhoons) and six were damaged.   We lost a Beaufighter.Single high-flying aircraft again made flights over wide areas of this country.These aircraft were seen by some of our fighter pilots at heights ranging up to more than 40.000 feet.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.34. Aircraft of Fighter and Bomber Commands and of the U.S.A.8th Bomber Command flew 1,196, 22 and 171 offensive sorties respectivelycompared with 1,561, 42 and 36 last week.Aerodromes at St. Omer, the railway centre at Sotteville (Rouen), the Potezairframe factory at Meaulte and shipyards at Rotterdam were all attacked by .S.A. Fortresses. At St. Omer, heavy cloud prevented the observation of results,but Sotteville, where about 70 tons of H.E. and incendiaries were dropped, has since been photographed and the damage assessment is reported in Appendix VII.Both at Meaulte and Rotterdam, considerable enemy fighter opposition was encountered. At the former, photographs taken at the time of the attack showat least 18 bursts among the factory buildings, but at Rotterdam only a small proportion of the aircraft despatched were able to bomb the target. A total of120 Fortresses were engaged in these, operations and they destroyed 17 enemy fighters, probably destroyed 23 and damaged 37, whilst the 41 squadrons of Alliedfighters which were engaged on escort and diversionary sweeps destroyed a further three, probably destroyed five and damaged eight. Two Fortresses and11 Spitfires (one pilot was rescued) are missing.The docks at Havre and the Drucat aerodrome at Abbeville were bombed by escorted U.S.A. Bostons.Mosquitos, operating singly, bombed the Iron and Steel works at Ijmuidenand a number of objectives in the Ruhr and North-West Germany.Small-scale harassing operations were carried out by aircraft of army co-operation Command.The Photographic Reconnaissance Unit flew 55 sorties and. a further 47photographic sorties were made by aircraft of Army Co-operation Command.One Spitfire is missing.Night.35. Bomber Command despatched 724 aircraft against land targetscompared with 1,028 last week. About 776 tons of H.E. (including 4 x 8,000 lbs.and 156 x 4,000 lbs.) and 655 tons of incendiaries were dropped during the week,and. these tonnages were distributed about equally over the three main targets Bremen, Duisburg and Frankfurt.The attack on Bremen was carried out by 209 aircraft in good visibility, theflares from the Pathfinders again being of great assistance in lighting up the target, Many large fires in the town were reported, and also in the region of theFocke Wulf works, which was the target for some of the Lancasters. Photo-graphs taken on the following day confirm the success of the attack and are reported on in Appendix VII.At Duisburg, which was attacked by 175 aircraft, visibility was fair, butin spite of flares being dropped squarely in the town and dock areas, the attack-would appear to have lacked the concentration seen at Bremen, numerous scatteredfires being reported in an area formed by Hamborn. Duisburg and.OberhausenPart of Duisburg has since been photographed (see Appendix VII).
A persistent ground haze and intense searchlight activity made accurateidentification difficult at Frankfurt. Widespread fires were observed, but it isbelieved that a number of bombs fell in Russelheim, 14 miles to the S.W. of the target; this is where the Opel works are situated.From these three operations, and a small-scale attack on Emden carried outin bad weather, 27 bombers are missing and a further nine crashed in this country.One Ju. 88 was destroyed and another was probably destroyed.Thirty-six &quot;Intruder&quot; sorties were flown from which four aircraft are missing.Coastal Operations. ,36. Coastal Command despatched 553 sorties, of which 239 were on anti-U-boat operations and 61 on convoy escorts. Bomber Command despatched39 aircraft on patrols in Bay of Biscay area. Fighter Command flew 816 shipping-protection patrols, of which 32 were flown by U.S.A.A.C. aircraft.Four Whirlwinds, carrying bombs, with fighter escort, attacked four ships ofabout 1,200 tons each off Cap de la Hague. One ship was sunk and another was probably sunk.Two night attacks by a total of 23 Hudsons and nine Naval Swordfish and aday attack by six escorted Bostons of Bomber Command were made on a medium-sized vessel in Boulogne harbour.  No hits ai&apos;e claimed..  One Hudson is missing.Escorted Bostons also attacked whale oil factory ships at Havre andCherbourg.A total of 26 Hudsons made three night attacks on shipping off the frisian islands.   Seven vessels were attacked, two of which were hit.Aircraft of Bomber Command laid 220 mines in enemy waters; one aircraft is missing and another crashed.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.37. In the week ending 7th September 3,374 sorties were flown by allied aircraft, compared with 1.703 in the previous week. On the 3rd a total of 889sorties were flown, including 202 by light bombers.Enemy concentrations in the battle area were continuously bombed by light and fighter bombers by day and by Naval Albacores and medium and light bombersby night. Many vehicles were destroyed, especially on the 5th. when enemy M.T.moved westwards through a minefield.Our fighters flew numerous reconnaissances and offensive patrols&apos;over the battle area, intruder patrols over enemy landing grounds, and provided protection for shipping off the Egyptian Coast. Long-range fighters attacked traffic on the coastal road; on the 8th, at least 50 vehicles were destroyed or damaged betweenMersa Matruh and Sollum.Tobruk was heavily bombed on five nights. Fires were started on a ship, onthe jetties&apos; and near the naval fuel tanks. A dusk attack was made by U.S.A.Liberators.  El Daba landing ground was also bombed.Enemy fighter bombers and dive-bombers with fighter escort attacked burgun positions, troops, tanks and M.T. in the battle area. These were successfullyintercepted by our fighters. One enemy formation had three aircraft destroyed,four probably destroyed and five damaged, for the loss of one Spitfire, the pilotof which is safe.Long-range bombers operating from Crete attacked our concentrations inthe El Alamein-El Ruweisat area and landing grounds near Alexandria. Atleast six of the bombers which attacked the landing grounds were shot down by fighters.Malta.38. Enemy activity was on a very small scale. The only bombing attack wasmade by a Ju. 88, which caused no damage. A few fighters flew over the Island.One was destroyed and two were damaged by Spitfires.Sicily.39. Offensive sweeps by Spitfires were carried out over Southern Sicily by day and intruder patrols were flown by Beaufighters by night. Reconnaissanceswere made of harbours and aerodromes.
Crete.40. Halifaxes and U.S.A. Liberators bombed Heraklion harbour and aero-drome, Maleme aerodrome and Suda Bay. Bursts were seen on warehouses, a power station and among aircraft.Sea Communications.41. A 5,000-ton vessel, which was reported aground, off Cape Spartivento inparagraph 43 of last week&apos;s Resume, was again attacked and torpedoed by NavalAlbacores.   A destroyer was hit with a bomb.Wellingtons and U.S.A. Liberators made two attacks on a southboundconvoy south of Crete. A 6,000-ton merchant vessel was sunk and a destroyer was set on fire. Another vessel was torpedoed by a submarine.A southbound convoy, consisting of four merchant vessels escorted by11 destroyers and 12 aircraft, was attacked on the 6th 50 miles south of Otrantoby Beauforts and Beaufighters. One vessel was hit by a torpedo and another was probably hit. Two escorting aircraft were destroyed and seven were damaged.On the night 7th/8th, the convoy was again attacked north of Derna. Four hitswith bombs were obtained on a merchant vessel and three on a destroyer. Anothermerchant vessel of about 6,000 tons was probably hit.Another convoy south-west of Crete was attacked by heavy bombers. one ship was hit and near misses were obtained.on others.Spitfires attacked an enemy reporting vessel off the south coast of Sicily,and Wellingtons bombed a small merchant vessel off the east coast. Enemy tank-landinsr craft were attacked off Mersa Matruh.Russia.42. About 2,500 German aircraft continue to be engaged on the whole ofthe Russian, front, a figure which has not varied appreciably since the early summer; of these, it is estimated that about 1,500 aircraft are operating in south russia. The attack on Stalingrad during the past three to four weeks was supported by a force believed to consist of not less than 1,000 aircraft, and air operations have been on an extremely heavy scale. Not only the town of stalingrad, but Russian communications, aerodromes and troop concentrationshave all been heavily attacked. Considerably less air support has been providedfor operations in the Caucasus, and even this has been available only sincethe German advance reached the hilly country on the north of the range.It is estimated that about 650 aircraft were operating on the Moscow front,but there is no reason to believe that air operations have been on a heavier scale than was necessary to contain the Russian attacks in this area. It is not thoughtthat so far the Russians have succeeded in bringing about the transfer to this front of any part of the German Air Force engaged in South Russia, althoughreinforcements have arrived from the Leningrad front, where there are probably not more than 150 aircraft of all types at present operating.Although the total force engaged in Russia during the present campaign hasbeen almost identical in size with that employed during the summer of 1941, air operations on a substantial scale have in contrast been confined mainly to theSouthern Sector and not on the entire front. The forces located&quot; on the moscow and Leningrad fronts have, in fact, constituted little more than a holding force, and the German policy appears to have been to conserve the german air Force so far as possible by limiting operations to one main sector only, withthe result that losses and wastage are likely so far to have been on a substancially lower scale than was experienced up to September 1941.Considerable Russian air activity has taken place over various sectors of thefront.A force of long-range bombers raided Budapest and towns in East Prussiaand Poland.Burma.43. Twenty Blenheims and six Ffudsons made a total of four attacks on targets at Akyab. A 1,500-ton ammunition ship in the harbour was hit andprobably sunk, and an escort vessel was damaged. Other hits were made on ajetty where ammunition was stacked. One enemy fighter was probably destroyed and another damaged.   Four of our aircraft are missing.R.A.F. and. U.S.A. aircraft continued to drop supplies for Chinese forces in north Burma.
New Guinea.44. Allied bombers and fighters were actively engaged in attackingenemy positions in the Kokoda and Efogi areas, the latter (about 7 miles west ofthe gap in the Owen Stanley range) having been occupied by the Japanese on the6th. Other enemy positions in the Salamaua and Milne Bay areas were also attacked. Fires were started at Buna aerodrome as a result of a raid by U.S.A.fighters and. medium bombers. Other U.S.A. bombers attacked the runwayat Lae.U.S.A. Fortresses bombed shipping near Kitava Island (Trobriand group)and barges near Buna. One barge was hit. A total of four enemy cruisers andtwo destroyers oft&apos; Trobriand and Normanby Islands were attacked by Alliedbombers and torpedo-carrying aircraft but no hits are claimed.Our aerodromes at Port Moresby and Milne Bay were attacked by 26 and nine escorted bombers respectively. Only slight damage was caused at eachplace.  One enemy bomber was destroyed by A.A. fire.Solomon Islands.45. Catalinas made two attacks on Buka aerodrome, hits being obtained on fuel dumps.A Fortress bombed and set on fire an enemy ta nkci or seaplane tender offthe north coast of Santa Isabel Island, and a Japanese four-engined flying-boat was shot down by a U.S.A. patrol aircraft north-east of the Solomons.Allied, aircraft bombed and machine-gunned enemy shore installations onGizo Island (New Georgia group).A total of 44 enemy bombers with fighter escort made two attacks on Alliedpositions in Guadalcanal Island, inflicting only minor damage. Our fighters destroyed 13 bombers and six fighters.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.46. There h*as been no heavy bombing, but scattered incidents have occurred on five days and four nights of the past week. By day the incidents have chieflybeen on the coastal areas of the South, South-West and the East. By nightbombing extended from the South and East Coasts to the Home Counties, east anglia and the Tees-side. Dover was shelled from the French Coast on two nights. A number of leaflets dealing with our operations at Dieppe have been dropped. These consist almost wholly of photographs depicting our casulties on the beaches and prisoners under escort.Damage.47. No serious damage of national importance was done. The moreimportant incidents occurred on the 3rd at Castle Cary railway station, wherethe main line- was blocked and considerable damage done to station premises and trucks, and on the 6th/7th at Middlesbrough, where a partial stoppage was caused at the Cargo Fleet Iron Co. by interruption of electricity supply. Otherincidents involving damage to property were at Selsey (the 3rd), Torquay andPaignton (the 4th), Norwich and Luton (the 5th), Dover (the 6th), Temple Combe(the 5th/6th), Whitby and Haverton Hill (the 6th/7th).Casualties.48. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending the 9th Septemberare 76 killed and 81 seriously injured.
