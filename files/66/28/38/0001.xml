(48)40813TH SEPTEMBER,  1942.FAR CABINETCEYLON FOOD supplies memorandum by the Secretary of state for the colonies think it necessary to &quot;bring to the notice of mycolleagues the position as regards the supply of cereals to meetthe needs of Ceylon,2. Rice is the staple food of the people of Ceylon.    Whenthe usual supplies from Burma ceased Ceylon found itself with about five weeks1  stocks of rice at the normal rate of consumptionThe Government lost no time in instituting a fairly severe scale of rice rationing (approximately two-thirds ef normal consumption)Negotiations for the supply of rice were immediately opened withthe Government of India, who in due course gave the veryencouraging assurance that they would treat Ceylon as if it were an Indian province &quot;by meeting the Island1s current needs of30,000 tons of rice a month.      The Government of India alsoundertook to increase the export of rice above the monthly averagebetween March and May,  in ord.er to build up stocks in the Island.3* At the same time the Government of Ceylon took theprecaution of seeking increased supplies of wheat and flour from australia and were assured of shipments of these commodities atthe average rate of 1-5,000 tons a month.4. The Government of India unfortunately found, itimpossible to carry out the assurance which they gave-to Ceylonafter the loss of Burma,  and in June last - by which time thesupplies actually being sent to Ceylon had fallen far below their undertaking - they reported a deterioration in their ownrice position due to increasing demands from the militaryauthorities and grave shipping, and transport difficulties.    Pacedwith this situation, and with the stocks in the Island reducedto thirteen days&apos;  supply, the Government of Ceylon introducedstill more severe rationing by a further cut of 25 per cent, inthe consumption rate.5. During the month of July only 6,000 tons of rice (abouteight days&apos;  supply on the present ration basis) were obtainedfrom India.      About this time it became clear that even the expectation of regular supplies of 15,000 tons a month fromMadras were not likely to materialise,  and that the severecompetition and high prices prevailing on the - Indian market would make further assured supplies from any Indian portproblematical.    In these circumstances the Ceylon government copy NO.
sought early last month (i) to increagm from&apos;15?000 to38,000 tons a month their supplies of wheat ana flour from australia and (ii) to obtain an additional shipment of 25,000tons to provide the nucleus of a reserve.    It would have beenpossible to achieve that target, which involved a total import of 101,000 tons during August .and September,  only by&apos; a diversion from ships engaged in the United Kingdom import programme.    The Minister of Food was good enough to agree tothe modification of the programme involved by that diversion,though he has stated that this must be. regarded as an exceptional expedient,   stipulating that in the present uncertain,conditions he cannot commit himself to any further encroachmentupon the shipping available for imports to this country inorder to meet even the current needs of Ceylon.    unfortunately the Civil Requirements (shipping) Committee of the Ministry ofWar Transport at their last meeting decided that the noticewas too short to. arrange for the diversion to which theMinister of Food had agreed for August and September.Consequently the-position is now the same as it was prior to approach being made to Lord Woolton for assistance,6. .. From the defence standpoint the uncertainty of thesituation.is most undesirable.      Should the enemy attack Ceylon,the period for which resistance could be sustained would clearly be influenced by the availability of civilian food stocks.    The Commander-in-Chief,  Ceylon, has reported to theWar Office in a telegram,  a copy of which is annexed, that the stocks.-of rice, wheat and flour available in the Island onthe 28th of August, together with shipments then expectedduring September, were- sufficient on the present ration scale to provide only up to the third week in October.    It is clearlyimportant, therefore,  that concurrently with the increasedimportation of wheat and flour from Australia,   every effort should be made to accumulate rice from India for the purposeof building up a reserve.    In the same telegram Admiral Laytonstates his intention to set aside for that purpose any ricearriving from India during the remainder of this year.7. The question is also of importance from the point ofview of maintaining Ceylon&apos;s production of rubber and other essential raw materials.    I have already had some reportstending to show that the morale and efficiency of estatelabour are suffering owing to the food position.      Wo cannot afford to run risks which may endanger the maintenance ofsupplies vital to our war effort.8. I feel that it should now be considered whetherthe Government of India should not be urged in the &quot;common&apos;interest, to undertake some exceptional measures to assure, ricesupplies to Ceylon.    Ceylon&apos;s needs are small in comparisonwith the scale of rice consumption in India itself - 360,000tons per annum as compared with 26-g- million tons - and thesatisfying of those needs should not entail any -substantialsacrifice on the part of the people of India.9** If the suggested approach to the Government of india is not made or should fail in its purpose, it will,  I submit,be essential to maintain regular supplies of &quot;wheat and flourfrom Australia in order at least to meet the current needs of ceylon.    That would, I understand,  involve a continuingencroachment upon the shipping available for Imports of food to
the United Kingdom,  and if my colleagues agree with me that from the military standpoint a reserve of at least two months1supply of cereals should &quot;be built up in the Island,  a furthertemporary diversion of shipping from this country would &quot;benecessary.    The War Cabinet will no dount wish to take thisinto account as the only alternative to the assurance of steadysupplies of rice from India,C.Colonial Office,12TH SEPTEMBER, 1942,AKNEXURE.MOST SECRET CIPHER TELEGRAM070741.Prom: C.-in-C.

Four.      Ceylon&apos;s rGQ.uirer.ient&apos; of-38,000 tons of wheat and wheat flour from Australia per month is &quot;based oninstruction in Secretary of State for Colonies telegramNOs 929 not to rely on any supplies of rice from India.It is essential &quot;therefore that shipping be made available tbring supplies of wheat and flour from Australia to Ceylon  1at the rate of 38,000 tons a month for the three monthsOctober to December at least and that substantial supplies should reach Ceylon not later than the first week in. Octobo1;additional to the 20,000 tons already reported as shipped.Difficulties of internal distribution make it essentialthat a margin of at least two weeks&apos;  supplies should always be kept in hand.Five.      During this period (until the end of the year)any rice that arrives from India&apos; would go towards building up a food reserve. &apos; .   .tSix.      Matter is under constant review with primary-Object of obtaining definite monthly quota, from India assoon as possible.    In view of the great uncertainty asregards Indian supplies impossible- to make any long termforecast of requirements at present. i &apos;Seven.
