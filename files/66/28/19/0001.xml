TO THE MINISTER OP PRODUCTION *&quot; ..Memorandum by the Lord President andthe Minister, of. production.     We have been concerned for seme -time as to the best way to deal with the agitation in Parliament and in the press about our scientific and technicalorganisation in the production sphere.   We think that this agitation has been tosome extent ill-conceived and largely basted on ignorance of our organisation andits achievements.   At the same time we have not felt able to ignore the general feeling of uneasiness and unrest in scientific circles, nor have- we felt thatour existing organisation enabled us to answer adequately all the critioismsthat have been expressed. .2.     Some weeks ago, therefore, with ,tho approval of the Prime Minister, weinvited the scientists themselves to suggest names from which we could choosethroe men of scientific and technical competence and good judgment to join thestaff of the Minister of Production on a whole time basis.   The Lord Privy Sealoffered to supervise and co-ordinate their activities on behalf cf. theMinister of Production end the Minister has accepted this offer.3.     As a. result of recommendations received through the Scientific AdvisoryCommittee and the Engineering Advisory Committee, the following persons havenow been appointed:Mr. T. R. Morton, formerly Professor of Spectroscopy, Oxford University,aftid Tx^aasurcr 6&amp;P&apos;the Rotfnl SocietyDr. I. M. Heilbron, F.R.S., Professor of Organic Chemistry,luiperial College of Science and Technology,Mr.. W. A. Stonier,, Past President of the Institute of MechanicalEngineers and Chief Mechanical.

Their field of activity will bo/oo-extensivo
co-cxtonsivc with the responsibility of the  Sinister of Production and the minister nay cell upon them to conduct enquiries and to moke reports uponparticular natters as nay be required.   Shey &quot;will not interfere with the work being done by the scientific and technical staffs of the-departments,--or withthat of any existing inter-dcpartmontal organisation, but they will be .kept informed of general scientific activities in the field of productionj   theywill be available to assist in any difficulties that nay arise and.to. make suggestions from time to time.   They will co-operate closely with the manydistinguished engineers and scientists who are already serving in or with(k)vernment departments, in industry and in academical and research institutions.We feel sure that those already engaged in scientific work in the various departments will welcome their assistance and will give them every facility tocarry out their work.5.     In view of the somewhat unusual nature of these arrangements and of thepublic interest in this topic, we have thought it best to bring this natterto the notice of the War Cabinet.   It is proposed to make a public announcenentin the terns shown in the annex for publication in the press on the morning of saturday, September 5th.(initialled)   J.A.O.L.

This organisation has been carefully built up)Lt a period of years and the Government believe it to be efficient,tie creation of the post of Minister of Production has, however, affordedopportunity for a development which the Government believe will be toIhe National advantage.In order to ensure that the fullest use is made of our scientifictechnical resources in the field of production, the Minister of reduction has appointed Mr. W.A. Stanier (Chief Mechanical Engineer tohe London Midland and Scottish Railway), Mr. M.R. Merton (Treasurer of health  Royal Society) and Dr. I.M. Reilbron (Professor of Organic Chemistry,nperial College of Science and Technology) to his staff in the capacityf full-time Scientific Advisers.The field of activity of these advisers will be c^-extensive with theIBesponsibility of the Minister of Production.     They will keep in closeouch with the scientific advisers of the Service and Supply Departments(id will be available to assist the departmental organisations ofcientific research and technical development.
